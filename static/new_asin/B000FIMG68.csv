2568604,1,B000FIMG68,All the reviewers are correct this show sucks!,1147651200,8,46,4.875
2568605,5,B000FIMG68,"FIRST OFF,LOST IS THE ONLY TV SHOW THAT I ""MUST"" WATCH. I MUST ADMIT,I WAS SKEPTICAL AFTER HEARING THE PREMISE OF THE SHOW IN ITS 1ST FEW WEEKS. I NEVER WATCHED IT UNTIL IT SEASON 1 WAS RELEASED ON DVD. I MUST HAVE WATCHED ALL THE EPISODES WITHIN 3-4 DAYS. WOW! WHAT A COMPELLING SHOW,FULL OF TWISTS,MYSTERIES,AND GREAT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. AFTER WATCHING AND REWATCHING SEASON 1,SEASON 2'S 1ST EPISODE BEGAN. WHAT A GREAT START TO THE 2ND SEASON!!! NOW,THERE ARE STILL 2 EPISODES LEFT,AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. SEASON 2 EASILY SURPASSES SEASON 1,HANDS DOWN! WE HAVE MORE CHARACTERS,3 DEATHS (SO FAR),DETAIL ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS OTHERS,AND MORE SECRETS ABOUT THE HATCH(ES).ALSO IT IS RUMORED THAT THE SEASON FINALE WILL SHOW THE REASON FLIGHT 815 WENT DOWN!!! WOW! THAT'S A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER IN 1 SEASON! THE ONLY THING,I REPEAT,THE ONLY THING THAT HURT THIS SEASON WAS THE DELAY BETWEEN EPISODES. I CAN'T THINK OF ANY BAD EPISODES,SOME WERE JUST BETTER THAN OTHERS.I THINK WHEN J.J. RETURNS? NEXT SEASON,IT WILL BE EVEN BETTER! SOME REVIEWERS SAY THIS SEASON IS ALL ABOUT THE ISLAND AND NOT THE CHARACTERS.THE ISLAND IS WHAT IS SO DIFFERENT THAN OTHER CHARACTER DRIVEN SHOWS.HOW MANY DETECTIVE OR HOSPITAL THEMED SHOWS DO WE NEED?!? THE MYSTERY OF THE ISLAND IS WHAT DRAWS ME BACK WEEK AFTER WEEK.EACH ANSWER BRINGS FORTH NEW QUESTIONS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SHOW AND ARE UNSATISFIED WITH SEASON 2,THEN WHY ARE YOU WATCHING IT EVERY WEEK?!? FOR ME,LOST IS THE BEST SHOW OUT THERE. I WILL GET THIS DVD SET ON OCTOBER 3RD,WILL YOU?",1147651200,6,1542,4.84469696969697

2568607,5,B000FIMG68,When did Lost become a second season slump? These idiots don;t know what they are talking about. The second season is just as good as the first.,1147564800,7,144,4.37037037037037
2568608,5,B000FIMG68,Despite what some reviewes here are calling a sophmore slump Lost may be differant this second season but it is still a good season. In order for a show to drow you can't always be doing the same things.,1147564800,6,203,4.230769230769231
2568609,4,B000FIMG68,"It was bound to happen -- after a breathtaking first season, expectations were high for the continuation of ""Lost,"" a creepy, semi-mystical series with a checkered cast and an exotic island setting.

""Lost's"" second season builds on the story of the first season, picking up where it left off. Though it has some flaws -- a bit of bad casting and some lag in the ""island"" stories -- it's still intriguing and eerie, and solves old mysteries as it introduces new ones, with shocking twists on characters you thought you knew.

As the season opens, Locke, Kate and Jack finally enter the mysterious hatch. But they didn't count on finding a concrete bunker, a button that might postpone doomsday -- and a frantic man who is very familiar to Jack. Meanwhile, Michael, Sawyer and Jin manage to make it back to the island -- and are promptly captured by a band of strangers.

These people turn out to be castaways from the fallen plane's tail section, led by the suspicious Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodrieguez). They make the trek to the opposite side of the island, but as they arrive, Ana makes a fatal mistake -- she shoots Shannon. Nice way to start integrating the groups.

As the season goes on, new personal crises arise when Locke loses faith in the island, Michael goes off to find Walt, Hurley falls in love with one of the tailies, Claire explores what happened to her during her ""missing month,"" and Sawyer scores an unexpected coup which gets him all the guns in the camp.

As the season goes on, things start to heat up. The mysterious French woman gives an ""Other"" she trapped over to Sayid, but is he really an enemy, or just an innocent castaway? And as Locke and Eko discover the true purpose of the hatches, one of the lost returns to the camp -- and treachery is guiding the castaways into a trap...

""Lost""'s second seasons started out strong and thrilling, then hit a dead spot for a few episodes, before picking back up again. While the middling episodes are solid enough, the best parts are at the start and finish, where the writers throw several shocking twists into the storyline.

The mystery of the island itself is not solved -- the presence of the mysterious Dharma Corporation is revealed. But the corporation doesn't explain how the island has healing powers. Some answers are revealed, and some mysteries simply get more complex. On the character backstory front, the castaways' problems still haunt them, from imaginary friends to torture to drugs.

The returning cast continues the compelling job they did in the first season, especially Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Daniel Dae Kim, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia, who all get their pasts raked up again; the actors do a magnificent job with guilt, sorrow, longing, and love. In fact, all of them do a good job, including ex-star Maggie Grace, who manages to make us actually LIKE Shannon in her final episode.

As for the ""tailies,"" there are good and bad choices. Michelle Rodrieguez was an appalling choice, since her butch ex-cop is the same character she's been doing for years. But on the flip side is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who quickly won fans' hearts as the spiritual Mr. Eko, a mysterious and dangerous priest/drugrunner. Think a Christian counterpart to Locke's animist believer.

""Lost"" stumbled a bit in the middle of the second season, but regained its footing for shocking, explosive episodes leading up to the finale. If only all second seasons were as good as this.",1147478400,10,3470,4.807046979865772
2568610,4,B000FIMG68,"I was one of those people who last year in September took the chance to watch a little show called Lost when they aired the pilot and since then I've been hooked. This is one of those shows that is addictive. Usually, shows like this don't attract that many fans and it ends up getting cancled but Lost has gotten a huge fan base which will most likly keep this show on for five seasons.

The first season was great, the second season has been a downer because it's not near as good as the first season but when it's good, it's great. Lost is now #2 on my best TV show (Prison Break has taken the #1 slot) but the show is not going downhill! Every TV show has a downer season and it usually comes after the success of the first season. Then there are shows that don't do well in the beginning and then do great later on. Remember Seinfeld? The first three seasons were nothing that special but once it hit the fourth season it became a great show... and then it got a little dissapointing towards the end. I can't complelty review this series since there's still two more episodes left, but knowing Lost they will pick up the pace for those episodes.

As for the DVD, most of the features that were there in the first season are back for the second season. Including bloopers, deleted flashbacks, deleted scenes, lost on location, and also includes the new lost connections, and anatomoy of an episode. So the extra features are a very nice plus. It'll also have commentary on selected episodes. Overall, if you're expecting this to be as good as the first season, you're in for a dissapointment. Last seaosn was all about the characters and this season is all about the mysteries of the island. There's some new characters and some of the old characters change the way we look at them, but overall it's a great show with only a good season not a great one.",1147478400,19,1857,4.395348837209302
2568611,5,B000FIMG68,"LOST is one of the best TV shows (along with Desperate Housewives, Greys Anatomy, and Prison Break) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD sets and it really shows.

Lost The Complete Second Season - The Extended Experience will be released as a 7 disc DVD set and it includes all season 2 episodes of the this awesome show. Season 2 explores even more discoveries. The set will be presented once again in widescreen with a 5.1 Surround Sound along with Over 8 Hours of Bonus Materials including the ones below courtesy of the press release from Buena Vista/Disney.

2568613,2,B000FIMG68,"Please be aware that this review has nothing to do with LOST and Season 2. As a fan, I have watched and rewatched the entire series and love it,
 especially season 2 (well, except maybe seasons 4 & 6- I didn't really care for either of those). However, I ordered this Season 2 directly from Amazon.com as new. When it arrived, it was clearly not new. No shrink wrap around the case. When I slid the sleeve off, I could see a bit or wear from use. Finally, I inspected the disc and saw light scratching and finger prints. The condition was good. I really am not that picky, and for the price I will be fine with it as is. However, I will be testing it out to verify that all of the discs actually work. I marked this at 2 stars because it is listed for sale AS NEW by AMAZON.COM when that is NOT what I received! Not cool Amazon!",1516665600,2,828,4.079754601226994

My copy was supposed to be Like New, but when I opened it up two of the discs had, what I can only imagine, either chocolate or fecal fingerprints all over it. I expected much better from Amazon Warehouse Deals. The box was also pretty rough and smelled funny. I have to go wash my hands again. Thanks.",1515542400,,379,4.277777777777778

2568617,2,B000FIMG68,"Some of season 1's spark is gone in season 2.

The season is weighed down by too many flash back sequences that are overly long and really doesn't propel the story forward. It is boring sorting through each of the character's personal demons.

I usually binge watch tv shows, but I am struggling with Lost.",1511395200,,306,4.545454545454546

2568635,4,B000FIMG68,"I'm 2/3 of the way through Season 2. Definitely preferred Season 1 (easily 5 stars). Obviously the story had to go somewhere beyond the beach after Season 1...so it takes on a less interesting set of storylines to me, but I'm still watching it on a regular basis in my man cave after my wife goes to bed. It's still good quality fiction, just doesn't pull me as completely as Season 1 did.",1489104000,,389,4.342465753424658
2568636,2,B000FIMG68,"if the characters in this show would just ask each other the questions normal people would, and if, once asked a question, they answered said question in a normal manner, there would be very little show left.  For example, if you saw something in the woods and wanted to show it to another person, would you just tell him to follow you now, immediately, forcibly even, no explanation offered, or would you actually say, hey, I saw this thing (box, plane, corpse, whatever) over there, can you come take a look at it and tell me what you think?  Nobody ever acts in a normal fashion.  Even the doctor, when confronted with a baby who might have some mysterious infectious disease, somehow never asks the only person who has seen people dying from this disease what the symptoms are in order to compare them with the baby's symptoms.  And despite several violent, deadly encounters, everyone seems to have no hesitation going out into the jungle alone, whether it is to garden, hide food, or just hang.  Plus everyone is always destroying stuff that might come in handy down the line:  hoarded food, drugs, a small plane.  Seriously, folks, even the heroin or whatever it was might come in handy at some point.  You might need it as an anesthetic for someone injured.",1487635200,,1265,4.666666666666667

2568638,3,B000FIMG68,This series started out so damn good.  My main issue is there are way too many flashbacks.  I'm assuming there are so many flashbacks to just fill out the time and make more seasons.  If they'd have left out the most of the flashbacks they'd only have a couple seasons of real material.  Then in this second series they implied via a flashback that it was possible the whole thing was a delusion in the brain of a mental patient.  So this appears to be just like the dream sequence in Dallas where JR wasn't actually killed.  Piss poor writing.  Plus the most intriguing character was shot and killed plus the boogie man is a black cloud.  WTF??  I had such high hopes for the series but now I'm not buying any more seasons.,1480377600,,724,4.343283582089552

2568647,4,B000FIMG68,"I haven't completed watching season two, but there is no question that it is an entertaining series.  I gave it 4 stars because it takes the cake for dragging something out!!",1469145600,,174,4.612903225806452
2568648,2,B000FIMG68,"I actually rate this from 2 Stars to 4 Stars, please read - I'll explain;
I originally watched this when it was on TV. Odd now watching it on DVD in 2016 - most of my memory of the events were wiped out.
Some of the initial premise is fascinating. A large group of people marooned on an island - and what they do.
I would say this 1st season is the best one - and it just gets too many bizarre twists to make it worth while - this continues in season 2.
On one hand this show can keep me on the edge of my seat - and often leaves each episode as a cliffhanger.
The 2 stars - is for how Despicable most of these characters are!! And the on-going downward spiral of television.
As in - if a show can't be 'Famous' - it might as well be 'Infamous'.
So - a plane drops from the sky - in a storm - at night. People are banged up - but a day or two - and
everyone is as fresh as a daisy. - Come On!!
Also they're on this stupid island for Months - and No one looks emaciated (thin, worn down - unhealthy)
People get beaten up - stabbed - shot and they behave with some temporary discomfort and bounce back.
Most of these characters I despise!! - I picture if I were in the shoes of these other fictional characters -
I would have Killed them by or During the 2nd season!! - People keep forgiving murderers and lunatics.
They also have Boundless energy to go on adventures - hikes and fight with others.
This plot goes beyond Convoluted!! - I can follow it - but it goes beyond imagination.
Sure it's exciting - but when I turn off the TV - I feel Uninspired by people. I'm 55 now - and I Love the 1960's TV,
Fun, silly, clever - with morals and fiber.
It's Sickening where TV has gone - and 'Lost' only Worsened this trend.
It gets to the point - where I hope None of these a-holes survive. - At least on Gilligan's - I liked All of them - and
Wanted them to get back home.
One lost - I want to fly overhead - with a B-52 and Bomb the whole cast!!
Sawyer, Sied(sp?), Kate, Shannon, Echo, Michael - and even Jack - I'd like to line them up against a wall - and Pop!!
Disgusting behaviors!! - I would Never want to meet people like them - but Unfortunately - I have
I blame the creators of this show - and although these actors have talent - they misused it by being willing to be on
such a show - that perpetuates and accelerates a dismal society.
In this season 2 - 'Hurley' gets in to 'recovery' from his food addiction - by Wasting what precious food they have
throwing gallons of Ranch dressing on the ground and throwing junk food up in air - as if they can spare this. STUPID!!
So - it's a 4 for excitement, twists and turns - and ultimately a 2 star - for leaving me feeling
Dejected and Hopeless about people and society. You might like feeling Dismal - but I Don't!!
Too bad this series Didn't last long enough - for the characters to put together a suicide pact. Scott M.",1469145600,,2874,4.017452006980803

2568662,2,B000FIMG68,"Tried hard to be entertained, but horribly written scenes made it difficult. An invisible T-Rex munches a pilot and shakes the forest, then vanishes from the island. Polar bears somehow thrive in the tropical paradise. Evil black murderous smoke rips trees out by the roots. The only extremely obese character is put in charge of vital food stores. A gorgeous women is kidnapped by a violent group of marooned men, then is released unharmed. The rude sarcastic selfish con-man, who hoards precious supplies is liked by everyone and is allowed to steal all the guns without retribution. A young woman gets amnesia after being kidnapped. After finding packaged food, the hoarder throws Oreos haphazardly onto the sand and gallons of food are destroyed in the jungle by the food junkie. An obsessed man who openly betrays the group is welcomed back with full trust. The list of unrealistic events are too numerous to point out. Scenes are repeated over and over during the never-ending flashbacks. The title could have been ""its a small world"" since everyone is connected to each other prior to the plane crash. When Jack and Claire became siblings my patience was nearly exhausted. The writers should have been fired. Surprised 4 more seasons were aired. Casting was good.",1459555200,,1270,4.995283018867925

Without going into detail (and possibly spoil the series) I will say, this season definitely answers a lot of ""up in the air"" questions from season 1, as well as opening up new scenarios, introducing (and eliminating) characters and situations throughout the season. One but of advise...listen carefully as the first few episodes are played. The information gleaned within will be made clear as the season progresses. One spoiler...six degrees of separation had nothing on this show! The coincidences, events definitely show the marvelously woven plot behind the title.

His birthday was coming up so I bought season one for him on DVD. His birthday was a month away so I decided to pop in a disc to check it out. I had to make sure the dvd's played didn't I? Tee Hee.

So within seconds I was hooked, and before I knew it I was done with the whole season. Great casting, great story, amazing location, it felt like watching a really long, really good movie.

The only downside I ever felt toward the show was the story of Michael and his son Walt. For two damn seasons all we see is this idiot running around yelling Walt! I swear the only lines that guy had was Walt, WALT WALT WALT WHERES MY SON. I GOTTA GET MY SON WALT. So freaking annoying!! Besides that, the show is a blast.",1407888000,,858,3.9825581395348837

I would have given it 5 stars except for: I am not particularly crazy about violence just for violence sake (this production is not overboard with violence so that is a plus), some of the plots leave one hanging for explanations as to the what and why events are occurring as they are, but if you just suspend your disbelief, and realize this is for entertainment, it works. Some of the events that are troubling are: the persons on this island seem to change too drastically from their previous ""lives"", the doc is perhaps too adept at using primitive surroundings to perform medical ""miracles"", what happened to the very powerful creatures that inhabit this island in the original episodes that we never really saw (did they evaporate?), just what kind of island is this (we never really know), there are too many bizarre places and things on this island, etc. I guess the bottom line is, so far, ""Lost"" does hold one's interest.",1385769600,,1063,4.71505376344086

2568846,5,B000FIMG68,"The first season of Lost ended on two significant cliffhangers.  Walt being taken by the ""others"" and the opening of the hatch.  The hatch becomes the focus of the season whereas the conclusion to what happened to Walt is only partially resolved by the end of the season.

The other big event of the season is we find out what happened to the people in the back of the plane.  They are given their own pilot episode, which also hurredly tells the story of their 48 days on the island, which leads up the their coming together with the rest of the characters.  We see that their experience on the island was much different than the other group.

If you only like shows that keep their seasons self contained and wrap things up in a bow at the end, then Lost is not for you.  It is always introducing new elements to the story even as it is resolving other things.  There is far less character development this season, although there is still some.  The flashbacks that occurred in season 1 still carry through, and we even start to see how some of the characters paths crossed before they were marooned on the island.  The characters are also in more peril this season, both from the island and from each other.  While the core group of characters made it through season one relatively unscathed, the same cannot be said this season. The season ends on another pretty big cliffhanger, along with one big question that permeates throughout the season once the hatch is opened being answered.

The series has very much a similar tone to what Alias had where almost every episode ends on either a cliffhanger or reveal, and sometimes both. I think it lends itself well to being watched consecutively because it is easier to follow and not have to remember where things left off after a hiatus.  The writing and acting are still top notch, and they do a good job of giving all the characters in the ensemble cast something to do, even though there are entire episodes where some characters never appear.

As far as the blu rays go.  The picture and sound are great.  There is about an hour and a half or so worth of extras, as well as commentary on select episodes.  If you have the patience to stick with the story and accept you are not going to learn everything at once, you should definitely check the series out.",1383782400,,2312,4.492822966507177

I just highly recommend it from the First season on. It's not your normal plane crash movie though. There are strange goings on, on this Island. If you don't mind a bit of sci-fi and fantasy thrown in to a Fantastic Drama, this show is for you! I suggest everyone give it a try. It's very thought provoking in which you'll be trying to figure
it all out. The characters and the actors who play them are just Terrific! The cast made this show so wonderful to be a part of. Hope you love it as much as we do.",1378512000,,654,4.1171875

2568897,5,B000FIMG68,"I do not write reviews often. Call it laziness. This is an instance when my normal tendency to sit back has been overcome by a the amazing quality of this show. It starts and ends with the writing. The plot is as intricate, creative and sophisticated as any I have seen. If you think you're going to be stuck on Gilligan's Island in the 21st Century, think again. The characters are numerous and complex; point of view is dynamic; the setting is elastic, changeable and always fresh. Throw in excellent acting and crisp cinematography, and you have a minor masterpiece. This one is not to be missed!",1376352000,,599,4.607476635514018

2568906,5,B000FIMG68,I previously owned the DVD versions of Lost seasons 1-3 (with 4-6 on Blu-ray). I was initially on the fence about upgrading to blu-ray but wanted the best experience when I decided to rewatch the entire series. It just didn't feel right not having everything in HD. It was well worth the purchase/upgrade.,1375142400,,305,4.773584905660377

2568911,5,B000FIMG68,Season one has you thinking one thing and then season two changes your mind completely in what you thought was really going on. It shows how much the characters are connected even if they don't know. The plot just thickens.,1374624000,,223,4.6

2569001,5,B000FIMG68,"The first season of lost was the greatest season of television in the 21st century. The second season does enough to keep the show fresh but not jump the shark. The show mixes things up by introducing another group of survivors and mixing them up with the original group. There are a few memorable characters, but sadly most of them don't last long.

Season 2 also provides worthwhile payoffs by finally letting the characters enter the mysterious hatch. Rather than kill the mystery, this creates several new mysteries. The Hatch ends up testing the survivors in several ways, mentally and physically.

However, what really makes season 2 work is the exploration of Locke's story. We learn much more about him. We see him struggle with his faith as he spends an increasing amount of time in the mysterious hatch. It's fascinating to see how he gained such purpose in his life from such miserable beginnings.

I never watched it EVER when it was on TV but my husband did (wasn't my husband then) and when we married in 2011 he BEGGED me to watch the LOST seasons with him but I didn't buy into all the hype back when it was on and didn't want to start now.

But I gave it more thought and I decided to go ahead and ""try"" and see if I could ""get through"" the first few episodes before telling him ""well I tried and it's just not that good"". Well, I was WRONG!!!! I could not believe how HOOKED my girls and I got from the very first episode and we still are! We cannot get enough of LOST. My 17 year old loves it and my 13 year old is absolutely obsessed with it!! She even started watching it from the very first episode ALL OVER AGAIN during times we aren't watching where we currently are at!! She's on Season 3 on her ""own time"" while we all watch it together.

We have watched Season 1-5 now with last night being the finale of season 5. We are VERY sad that season 6 is upon us already and will be very sad when we're all caught up and we're done. I bought season 3-6 on Amazon and I am SOOO glad I did!! I HOPE you will watch every single episode of LOST and give it a chance. We think it is the BEST show we have EVER seen!!

Heck, I even dream about it pretty much every night. The only thing I don't like is that there aren't enough episodes in season 5 and 6!!!! I cannot recommend LOST highly enough! There just isn't enough ""stars"" available to rate this show!!! You will fall in LOVE with the characters (we LOVE to list our favorite characters IN ORDER and discuss why and what's going on during each episode), LOVE the plot, LOVE the scenery, LOVE the humor!!! LOVE the whole CONCEPT of the show and LOVE LOVE LOVE being engrossed in it!!!!!

2569025,5,B000FIMG68,"The second season of LOST provides many questions for its fans. What is the Dharma Initiative? Where is the Island? Who are the Others? During this season viewers meet several new characters, say goodbye to others, learn more about the Island and the survivors of flight 815. Viewers also learn exactly what occurred during the plane crash and possibly why it crashed on the Island. Also, many more character flashbacks provide fans with more details about the survivors and their motivations to either stay on or leave the Island.

Season two is full of conflict, twists, revealations and mysteries. It is the first time that viewers meet Desmond, encounter the Others, enter the hatch and start to understand its purpose. Most importantly, it is the first time that MICHAELmATICIAN's transmission ""2.342"" reached the Island's radio tower (more on that in season 3).

2569036,5,B000FIMG68,"First let me say that this is a review of the entire series and not just the season. I will post this under every season so that everyone can see this review.  Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:

Season 1
Season 2
Season 3
Season 5
Season 6
Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.

*****Spoiler Alert *******

Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.

*****End Spoiler Alert******
If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.

Another reason that I'm glad to be watching this show recorded as opposed to TV is because there are a lot of little things to pick up on between the flashbacks and the present time. The characters continue to have a lot of depth and the interaction is wonderful. I have to say that my favorite character is John Locke who is a definite enigma.

2569045,5,B000FIMG68,"As a huge fan of the first season of Lost, I was anxious to get started watching Season 2.  Season One ended with two major questions: ""Where did the Others take Walt?"" and ""What is inside the hatch?"".  One of these questions is answered in Season Two's opening episode, titled ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"".  There are many great episodes this season, but the most unique is ""The Other 48 Days"", when we learn about the people on the tail section of the plane, and how their fight to survive on the island and their struggle with the Others is not all that different from that of our main cast of survivors.  Around halfway through the season, we introduce a new character, ""Henry Gale"", played by the fantastic Michael Emerson.  The season finale provides an explanation of what caused the crashing of Oceanic Flight 815.  Season 2 of Lost is a must see!

As with the first season's DVD set, Season 2 has seven discs - six discs full of episodes, with one disc for bonus material.  The best piece of bonus material in the set is the documentary ""Fire + Water"", a detailed look at the production of an episode from concept to completion.  ""Lost Connections"" is an interactive feature that shows the past and present connections of any two characters - but it is very annoying to navigate through.  ""The World According to Sawyer"" is the funniest bit on the bonus disc; it's a 3-minute montage of Sawyer's insults and pop culture references. There is a booklet that gives each episode title and gives a brief plot description.  The packaging is high-quality compared to other DVD box sets that I've seen.  Overall, this is a great show with adequate bonus material.",1269475200,,1666,4.629251700680272

2569049,4,B000FIMG68,"Alright, so coming off the high that was Season 1, we dive into Season 2. Unfortunately, like any other sophomore season, this show has a LOT of growing pains, and they're very evident. Sure, we get a lot more mystery, but most of the events of this season are virtually erased by the middle of Season 3. But don't worry, Lost is about characters, not story, right? Yeah, but they frustratingly can get much right there this season.

Highlight Episodes:
Man of Science, Man of Faith
The Other 48 Days
One of Them
Lockdown
Live Together, Die Alone

Alright, so we do get a lot of great moments in the Hatch, and we do get to know the Tailies, but by season's end, most of the Tailies are dead, and the hatch is blown up. The mystery certainly did its job, but in retrospect, it was kind of for nothing, besides a few character building moments. Which brings me to the Flashbacks. These moments in the first season often gave us insight into the characters, but in season two, they mostly tell us what we already know, and a lot of them feel just straight-up pointless and not enjoyable. Sure, they're useful when first meeting the Tailies, but that's about it.

Then there's the crime this season commits against its characters. By the end of the first season, we had grown to love these characters, and while they weren't always likable, they had a good reason to be so. This season however, it seems the Island has a tendency to just make everybody annoying/jerky. Basically Sawyer, Sayid & Locke are untouched by this rampage of bad turns with characters, but that's because they align with who they were last season. I can't say as much for the rest of the characters. Jack becomes increasingly more irrational/annoying when he goes he becomes more of a roguish leader shaped by the harsh reality of the Island. Kate isn't given that much to do, but between love-triangles & more irrationality, she became annoying very quickly. Michael wasn't there for most of the season, and he was just trying to get his son back, but I found him more frustrating and just being in the way of the action I actually cared about to care about his predicament, or even try to justify his actions, since they were completely irrational. Sun & Jin took way too long to get where they were going in their personal journeys.

And then there was Charlie. My god, what did the producers/writers do to Charlie? There was simply no reason to bring back the heroin storyline with him, and they just made him into a pompous jerk bent on being a smart-ass & nothing more. There was simply no reason to do this, and again, the Writers spent a LONG time after that to get the guy to become likable again, and it just barely worked because it reminded us of the Charlie of Season 1, since Charlie of Season 2 was a douche. I also wasn't a fan of Claire, since she became the new Shannon, ala annoying screaming girl, who I just lost all physical attraction for. And again, most of her actions are not rational in any sense of the word.

But, for all that Season 2 does wrong with the characters, it does introduce us to the wonder that is Michael Emerson & Desmond Hume. Henry Gale/Ben Linus just makes for such a perfect foil of John Locke, and his character is just so compelling, even though you don't know a single thing about him. His expressions, his actions, every word he speaks and doesn't speak is absolutely spell-binding. And even though Desmond Hume is only in the Season a grand total of 2 or 3 episodes, the character is fascinating on every level, and does the most with his short time.

Overall, the story is compelling and a lot of interesting stuff is raises, the Season suffers from a grand sense of pointlessness, and what it does to the characters that we fell in love with just a season before, is almost unforgivable. They may have Lost their way, but at least there's enough good elements here to find yourself getting through the Season, on to bigger and better stuff.",1266710400,,3967,4.525801952580196
2569050,4,B000FIMG68,"Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Locke (Terry O' Quinn), Sayid (Naveen Andrews), and the rest are back, or are still, on the island for the second season of Lost. Are there any survivors from the tail section of Oceanic 815, and if there are what happened to them? Who are The Others and where did they come from? What's in the hatch? What will become of Michael (Harold Perrineau), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and Walt (Malcolm David Kelley)? This season in Lost some of these questions will be answered, and many more questions will go unanswered!

By now, with the last season airing it's first episodes over the last couple of weeks, I'm starting to wish that I had started watching Lost sooner. I want to hurry up and get through the first five seasons so I can actually pay attention to what people are saying about the show in it's last season. Unfortunately, I have to avoid conversations about the show, or risk learning spoilers or getting lost in plotlines that haven't even started to unravel in the second season yet. I even had to set aside last week's copy of Entertainment Weekly because there was an article with predictions for the sixth season, which meant they were going to point out things in the rest of the seasons that I have not seen yet. Of course, my wanting to get through this has to do with the fact that I love the show, and only like it even more as time goes by and want to know how it's all going to end, just like when I read a great book.

Season two really feels like another beginning to the show. We're introduced to another cast of characters and new places, so a lot of the show is spent with these new characters and places this season in introductions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. And, of course, the writers do a great job of expounding on each character, focusing on a different character with a spotlight on one character with each episode. This focus doesn't take away from the show, or ever get tiring. Instead, this helps enlighten us as to as to who these characters are, and at times what motivates them to make the decisions that they make as well as giving us insight into the previous skills of each character and opening up new ways these characters were possibly connected before they crashed on the island.

The second season adds in new and exciting characters and great actors as well. In the second season we're introduced to characters played by Michelle Rodriguez (Avatar, The Fast and The Furious), Henry Ian Cusick (Dead Like Me: Life After Death, Hitman), Cynthia Watros (Titus, The Drew Carey Show), Julie Bowen (Modern Family, Happy Gilmore), and even Clancy Brown (Carnivale, The Guardian) and Katey Sagal (Married with Children, Sons of Anarchy) show up for a couple of episodes. The true standouts in this season though are Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (The Mummy Returns, The Bourne Identity) as Mr. Eko, a man with a dark past who is now a priest, and Michael Emerson (Saw, The Legend of Zorro), who might be one of The Others or just a man who happened to crashed on the island by other means. As always the acting in this season is as superb as it was in the first season from all of the actors involved.

The main problem I have with this season though is that some of the characters either go against the way a real person would act in certain situations, or make really bad decisions. It's the first time I've seen this from this series, and at times had me nearly screaming at the TV. These bad ideas from characters leads the plot along at certain points, and while the places we are lead are exciting and drive the suspense, I believe there were other ways to get there than making bad decisions. Of course, it could be explained by the fact that these people are scared for their lives on a deserted island they crashed on and spend their time scared for their lives. That will cause people to do strange and stupid things, but I still couldn't buy some of the things that the characters did in this season.

All in all, Lost is still one of the best shows created for TV, but season 2 hit a snag. Rather than feeling like a season all it's own, it feels more like a place mat. You know how you read a book and you hit a chapter that doesn't tell a part of the story like the rest do, or read a series of books where one book doesn't quite stand on it's own (here's looking at you Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince), well, that's the way that Lost season 2 feels. But, hey, Lost's possible worst season is still better than most TV series best!

4/5",1266364800,,4570,4.467065868263473
2569051,5,B000FIMG68,"In its second season Lost brought in a plethora of new characters, phenomena, plot developments, and plot theories.  It all worked becuase the series let itself bring things in at their proper pace, rather than rushing all elements and major characters into the first few episodes of Season 1.  The bonds and relationships that got started in the first season grow, as do the inter-group rivalries - surprisingly, the most profound rivalry affecting the series isn't between Jack and Sawyer, but between Jack and Locke, who end up on opposite poles of the leadership spectrum.  Jack's approach is practical, oriented towards finding a way to get the group off the island they're stranded on, and completely skeptical of any of the increasing hints as to a possible supernatural aspect to the island.  Locke's stance is grounded in the belief that there's something far bigger at a work than a plane crashing on an uncharted island, on the idea of fate, and his quest to explore and understand and participate in the 'big picture'.  In one regard, though, Locke's approach is more 'practical' (in the conventional sense of the word) than Jack's: Locke is the first in the group to become convinced that there are other people on the island, that they're hostile, and that there's something abnormal about this other group and its purpose (in other words, it's not a question of 'there might be a couple of cottages over on the other side of the island where people have their summer homes', it's something more unorthodox).  Most of the rest of the group seems determined not to accept this because of it's implications; Jack seems determined at this stage not to accept any suggestion that would require him to look at the island and its particular circumstances in a highly unorthodox manner, or even a fantasical one.

  The flashbacks in Season 2 are among the best of the whole series, with flashbacks delving into the back stories of Mr. Eko, Sawyer, and Sayid all being particularly powerful.  Of all the seasons, Season 2 is the one that may gain the most from a second viewing.  Part of the reason for this is that in the second half of the season, developments occur that initially have one wondering if all the revelations are going to end up being a letdown.  Without being too specific, there was an uncomfortable sense that the series was going to move in a direction that revealed all the great mysteries as more or less red herrings, that we'd get an explained situation that was too bland and stripped away the 'awe factor'.  Without going into what develops later, I think it's safe to say that the series doesn't do that.  Not at all.  At the same time, these possibilities arising Was a vital part of the show, and the affect it had on certain characters (Locke in particular) was an important part of their overall development.  Another reason it gains so much on the rewatch is that you can appreciate certain happenings that, on the first time around, no one had any idea how pivotal they were going to be.  I'm referring in part to the first appearance of a certain character who goes on to have a much larger role in the overall story than it would first appear when he's discovered.  Actually, come to think of it, there are two characters who could easily fit that bill...  And even the characters introduced here who turn out to be more or less 'supporting players' in the overall story have important impacts.

  Topped off with a tremendous double-cliffhanger ending that couples with a truly shocking revelation, the conclusion of this set'll have you rushing to buy Season 3, and with good reason.  Everything from the acting to the special effects to the cinematography capturing the island (at times gorgeous, at other times menacing) right through to the care in the packaging of the boxed set itself is first rate.  Highest reccommendation, although obviously newcomers to the series (or those just starting to rewatch the series afte seeing its first run on television) will want to start with Season 1.",1266105600,,4039,4.786743515850144

I do not wish to give out any spoilers except to say that I liked Locke and in particular Michael a lot less after Season Two--I liked both in Season One. (Who didn't?).  Both seem to be firmly established as losers by the end of Season Two.  Well, who knows, maybe Season Three will redeem one or both.  It has happened before.

2569060,4,B000FIMG68,"I didn't watch ""Lost"" when it first started but instead decided to catch it on DVD beginning a few months ago.  I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of fantasy or adventure shows, so I didn't think I was missing anything.  However, the reviews have been so consistently good that I decided to give ""Lost"" a chance.  Frankly, I was disappointed in the first season, which so many people said was a classic.  I found the show to be exceedingly slow moving.  Every time something happened on the island, we immediately went into a flashback.  Yes, the flashbacks helped further character development, but I found most of the main characters annoying, especially Jack, Kate, John Locke, and Sayid.  Their constant stubbornness was extremely annoying, so I really didn't care their back stories.  Likewise, too many scenes were repetitive and ended with the same arguments between the same main characters.

In season 2, things start to pick up quite a bit.  Numerous things actually happened ON the island and the flow of the show wasn't constantly interrupted with flashbacks.  Furthermore, the flashbacks became more interesting as we saw some of the same people showing up time and again.  My patience in slogging through Season 1 paid off during this season.  Not that all is perfect with the show.  Several of the new characters are just annoying as the previous ones, especially Ana Lucia.  J.J. Abrams seems to specialize in stubborn, rash, hot-headed characters who shoot or knock out people at the drop of a hat.  It gets so repetitive!  How many times can John Locke get knocked unconscious before his last remaining brain cells are damaged?!?!

Fortunately, during Season 2, ""Lost"" starts to take itself a bit less seriously.  I loved the scenes where the supporting characters start to question why Jack and Locke are in charge all the time.  That's the first questions I would have asked!  They have made so many poor decisions and lied so many times, why would these people trust them?!?!  At least the addition of new characters takes a bit of the focus off them.  All in all, there are enough positives in Season 2 that I plan on continuing to watch the series; which is not something I was excited about after Season 1.",1259280000,,2235,4.778067885117493

I think some of my dislike of Season Two was simply the ""soap opera"" like qualities in it. For instance, someone would ask another person a burning question that every watcher wants to know, then the other person would just stare at them. Sometimes the person had to ask again to get an answer or the scene might switch to some more backstory, or worse, switch to another scene entirely. It's hard for me to imagine someone asking another person a question, then sitting there watching them zone out for several minutes. I think they woudl start to wonder if the person was on drugs.

This sort of thing did happen in Season One, it was just not so prevalent there.

Unfortunately (and probably not surprisingly) the TV is just not capable of showing the improvement from regular DVD to Blu-ray.  I was able to purchase for a good price so it's no big deal, I guess I'll have to wait to really enjoy it until after I buy a new TV!",1254182400,,484,3.9690721649484537
2569067,5,B000FIMG68,"The first season drew me in. The crash, the mysterious surroundings of the Island, The black mist that seems to go after the survivors, the mysterious others, and then that mysterious hatch that just got it's lid blown off. We find out what that bright light came from, we discover that the hatch has a big surprise for those who want to venture in it.

The season begins slowly and drags on before things start to come into play. The character Desomond gets played out fully and tells them about the numbers that need to be punched in or something ""bad"" will occur. What gets me though is if this guy has been doing this for over three years, punching in the same numbers so many times a day, why isn't he suffering from loss of sleep? hmm....

We found out about the ""Tallies"" in which brings some more spice to the season. Michelle Rodriguez plays a great role trying to lead this band of survivors even though the deck was stacked against them a little more then the orginal cast. (she gets killed off too soon IMHO) The character that you will grow to hate quick is Michael. All of these elements keeps the show interesting. A stunning appearance also appears to viewers over the leader of the others.

The ending just screams for people to get the 3rd season. It dosn't quite has the cliff-hanger of the 1st season, but it does pave the way.",1253145600,,1347,4.445344129554656

2569071,5,B000FIMG68,"Lost avoided the sophomore slump in a major way in its second season by felxing its creative muscles.  The second season finds the show's creators increasing the moral complexity of the characthers, expanding their artistic ambitions and deepening the mysteries swirling about the island.  First and foremost is the hatch.  The second season wastes little time revealing the contents of the mysterious underground bunker which in turn leads to more questions.  We learn that the hatch is occupied by a man named Desmond who has been diligently entering numbers (the cryptic numbers from Season 1) into a computer and pusing a button every 108 minutes.  Why?  Desmond believes that he is saving the world.  From what?  Don't expect answers to that question anytime soon, at least not complete answers.  Remember, Lost is devoted to one long story arc.  The show does not follow the structure of most other shows and deal with short story arcs that provide quick answers and closure.  The majority of season 2 centers around the hatch, both physically (a good deal of action takes place there) and in terms of the plot.  But Season 2 brings a lot of other factors into the nix as well.  We learn even more about the complex backstories of the characters, which often interweave with one another tying in to the show's constant exploration of the theme of fate.  A new group of survivors are discovered on the other side of the island who crashed with the tail section of the plane.  Among them are Rose's husband, Anna Lucia who had an encounter with Jack in Season 1, and Mr. Echo who seems to serve as a counterpoint to Locke.  Speaking of Locke, he undergoes a crisis of faith which some fans may find maddening, but it's quite fitting for a character who ultimately doesn't know what he is supposed to be doing with his life or who he truly is.  Oh, and then there are the others.  Alluded to in Season 1, we finally get to meet them including their leader Ben, who disguises himself as Henry Gale, a stranded hot air baloonist who ifiltrates the ranks of the survivors.  All of this leads to more questions than answers of course.  Who are the others?  What is their purpose?  Why are they interested in Claire's baby?  Why did they take Walt?  We are also left to wonder if Desmond's button pushing in the Hatch has some purpose or if it's all part of a psychological experiment.  Season 2 is definitely one that will test the patience of casual fans.  Devoted fans, however, will find this season to be a deeply satisfying viewing experience full of action, drama, mystery and purpose.  It may not always seem like it, but the show's creators have mapped out where this show is heading and Season 2 is a major piece of the puzzle that will ultimately fall into place.",1250035200,,2772,4.650205761316872

2569073,4,B000FIMG68,"It was bound to happen -- after a breathtaking first season, expectations were high for the continuation of ""Lost,"" a creepy, semi-mystical series with a checkered cast and an exotic island setting.

""Lost's"" second season builds on the story of the first season, picking up where it left off. Though it has some flaws -- a bit of bad casting and some lag in the ""island"" stories -- it's still intriguing and eerie, and solves old mysteries as it introduces new ones, with shocking twists on characters you thought you knew.

As the season opens, Locke, Kate and Jack finally enter the mysterious hatch. But they didn't count on finding a concrete bunker, a button that might postpone doomsday -- and a frantic man who is very familiar to Jack. Meanwhile, Michael, Sawyer and Jin manage to make it back to the island -- and are promptly captured by a band of strangers.

These people turn out to be castaways from the fallen plane's tail section, led by the suspicious Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodrieguez). They make the trek to the opposite side of the island, but as they arrive, Ana makes a fatal mistake -- she shoots Shannon. Nice way to start integrating the groups.

As the season goes on, new personal crises arise when Locke loses faith in the island, Michael goes off to find Walt, Hurley falls in love with one of the tailies, Claire explores what happened to her during her ""missing month,"" and Sawyer scores an unexpected coup which gets him all the guns in the camp.

As the season goes on, things start to heat up. The mysterious French woman gives an ""Other"" she trapped over to Sayid, but is he really an enemy, or just an innocent castaway? And as Locke and Eko discover the true purpose of the hatches, one of the lost returns to the camp -- and treachery is guiding the castaways into a trap...

""Lost""'s second seasons started out strong and thrilling, then hit a dead spot for a few episodes, before picking back up again. While the middling episodes are solid enough, the best parts are at the start and finish, where the writers throw several shocking twists into the storyline.

The mystery of the island itself is not solved -- the presence of the mysterious Dharma Corporation is revealed. But the corporation doesn't explain how the island has healing powers. Some answers are revealed, and some mysteries simply get more complex. On the character backstory front, the castaways' problems still haunt them, from imaginary friends to torture to drugs.

The returning cast continues the compelling job they did in the first season, especially Dominic Monaghan, Evangeline Lilly, Daniel Dae Kim, Naveen Andrews, and Jorge Garcia, who all get their pasts raked up again; the actors do a magnificent job with guilt, sorrow, longing, and love. In fact, all of them do a good job, including ex-star Maggie Grace, who manages to make us actually LIKE Shannon in her final episode.

As for the ""tailies,"" there are good and bad choices. Michelle Rodrieguez was an appalling choice, since her butch ex-cop is the same character she's been doing for years. But on the flip side is Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who quickly won fans' hearts as the spiritual Mr. Eko, a mysterious and dangerous priest/drugrunner. Think a Christian counterpart to Locke's animist believer.

The extras are a fairly good bunch -- the video and sound are beautifully spruced up, and it has deleted scenes, a bunch of featurettes (on everything from the awesome Sawyer to the strange theories that the show provokes), Easter eggs, audio commentary with writers, directors and actors, cut flashbacks sneak peeks, bloopers, and so on and so forth.

""Lost"" stumbled a bit in the middle of the second season, but regained its footing for shocking, explosive episodes leading up to the finale. If only all second seasons were as good as this.",1249344000,,3823,4.821374045801527

2569078,3,B000FIMG68,"This is what you expect it to be. A blu-ray release of a TV show from several years ago. The video looks better than standard DVD, but its better within the limitations of the camera equipment that was used at the time.

The sound is great though. Thats really where any Blu-Ray really shines no matter what the source material.

There are extras over the DVD release. They included a bunch of promotional features that were only available on extra DVDs relaesed through retailers and media companies.

The Blu-Ray exclusive Extras are: Lost On Location ""The Other 48 Days"", Lost on Location ""What Kate Did"". There are are also five deleted scenes previously not available in the DVD: Good With Kids, Scissors, Kate's Choice, The Saw and Giving Care.

On the downside, there is no booklet or physical extras with the Discs. They don't even provide an episode list with titles in the packaging which is really annoying given the amount of content on the Discs. They also waste lots of physical space on the media to pad things out to seven discs.

Its virtue is that its cheap. There is a mail-in form included with the package for $20 back if you own the DVD version of season one or season two. After gouging people on season four, the rebates are very much appreciated.",1245715200,,1271,4.631111111111111

2569080,5,B000FIMG68,"Every leaf, every blade of grass, every grain of sand, every bead of sweat; watching Lost in 1080p high definition is an illuminating experience to say the least, and the ultimate way to watch one of the greatest television series ever created. From the lush jungle backdrops to the gritty Dharma stations, everything is presented in stunning definition, the kind that only Disney can bring to Blu-Ray.

Season 2 ups the ante for Lost, introducing new characters, villains, Dharma stations, island mysteries, and the infamous numbers. The plot thickens, the character studies get more intense, and the questions pile up as our beloved losties seek to unravel the mysterious of the island they crashed on in season 1. Without giving away too much, Season 2 introduces us to the tail section survivors, more Others goodness, and the strange ways of the Dharma Initiative, including the Dharma stations; and who can forget Marvin Candle?!

The picture quality is near pefect, with nary a qualm from my point of view. Colors pop on screen, detail is highly abundant from facial features to clothing textures to gritty surfaces and outdoor scenery; videophiles will not be disappointed. Though, as great as the picture quality is it doesn't match the quality of Season 3 or Season 4, but its still leagues better than the DVD and its television broadcast,and certainly up there with the best looking high definition releases to date. The audio is nothing to scoff at either, being presented in 5.1 uncompressed magnificance.

The only real disappointment to this otherwise spectacular package is the supplements, which are exactly the same as the DVD counterpart, and all in standard definition; otherwise Lost Season 2: The Extended Experience is a must own for lost fanatics and videophiles alike.",1245542400,,1794,5.1160409556314

""LOST"" Season 2 makes its first entry to Blu-ray and similar to both Season 3 and Season 4, the Blu-ray's allow for ""SeasonPlay"" that allows people to watch as they go and can stop, restart where they last left off.  ""SeasonPlay"" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""LOST""  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception.  There must have been a change with technical equipment for the second season because there is a quality difference from the first season and the second.  You will notice that picture quality is more detailed, more vibrant and colors are just absolutely popping in the second season compared to the first.  Skin tones and pores are much more evident and overall, picture quality is magnificent.

As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season.  Also, sounds of the island and even thunderstorms come quite clear through the various speaker channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE.  Overall, there appears to be more utilization of sound and how sound was used in the second season compared to the first.

Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!

JUDGMENT CALL:

The second season of ""LOST"" was excellent.  The first season established that the survivors were not the only people on the island and that there were ""Others"" that didn't like them being there.

But I always believed that there had to be other survivors from the plane wreckage since the plane broke apart in three sections and sure enough, the second season addressed that and we were introduced to new characters.  I know that for some viewers, adding additional characters when there were so many other characters that viewers were following already may be a bit overkill but for me, it was needed.

I felt that there was really good planning on how these characters were introduced but it did make me worry of how many major characters were being killed off in the series and I know for some people, they wondered if there was a correlation of them being killed off from the show due to their real life experiences of being busted for DUI.

Suffice to say that Michelle Rodriguez character of Ana Lucia had this love/hate relationship with fans because of her abrasiveness.  But as a former police officer and the things that she has done in her real life, you can understand why she was the dominant survivor from the tail-end.  I actually enjoyed every new character introduced and especially how the series sets the tone with the characters of Desmond and Ben Linus who play such a major factor on ""LOST"" in the next three seasons.

As for the original survivors, ""LOST"" really does play with one's emotions especially with the characters of Sayid and Hurley who have been put through major lows because of certain incidents.  Charlie and Michael, who were fan favorites have become men who quickly grown infamous with their actions in the second season and the love triangle between Jack, Kate and Sawyer has been intensified.  Especially the leadership between both Jack and Locke and putting these two characters at odds with each other.

Personally, I felt there was a tremendous amount of storyline and character development flashbacks that were just incredible to watch.  Answers to lingering questions from the first season but also more questions added in the second season as well.

With the introduction of the DHARMA Initiative and the HANSO foundation, it definitely gave writers a chance to play with podcasts, commercial ads, Internet websites, online videos and even audio books to tease people about this mysterious group.  And like many fans, even I found myself engrossed by following these various side stories and conspiracy theories.

""LOST - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON"" was a fantastic season that kept many fans in their seats and just shocked by certain developments of the series including major character deaths.  There was plenty of action of drama , action and its definitely interesting to watch this season once again and see how complex the planning went for this second season.

But I absolutely enjoyed ""LOST"" in its second season.  Granted, I may be a ""Lostie"" and have a strong bias towards this series but I truly believe that this is one of the best drama series on television in the last decade and to watch and enjoy the series with improved picture and audio quality on Blu-ray is just fantastic!

""LOST - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON"" is highly recommended!",1245110400,16,13829,4.721057046979865

2569086,4,B000FIMG68,"With the hatch no longer a mystery, the writers had to come up with some new form of suspense so we discover there are other survivors from the tailend of Oceanic 815, henceforward known as ""Tailies,"" led by the indominatable Ana Lucia, who Jack had recalled meeting at the airport bar near the end of last season, and one tough dude in Mr. Eko.  It seems they couldn't generate much with Desmond Hume other than a suspenseful intro into the season with Locke, Kate and Jack down in the hatch, leaving with nothing more than a ""so long, brother,"" as if the island is doomed to oblivion.

For the first half of the season, the Tailies carry the action, having captured Michael, Sawyer and Jin after washing back up on the island from their ill-fated attempt to escape the island.  The Tailies are even better than the previous Losties.  In addition to Ana Lucia and Eko, we discover Libby and Bernard and meet a mysterious person in Goodwin.  Not to be forgotten, the writers shift back and forth between the two sides of the island, keeping us apprised of the new situation that has occurred since the Losties found the stash at the former Dharma station, leaving Hurley to guard the food locker. Interesting choice.

We are filled in on a number of details, including the special significance of the numbers that cast a powerful grip on Locke.  Of course, Jack can't see what the point of the numbers exercise is but Hurley reminds him, ""They're bad, dude!"" or words to that effect.  Hurley is featured in an excellent episode, ""Dave,"" which really shows the kind of situation drama that can be generated from a show like this.  But, unfortunately for Team Jack, it is Team Ana that steals the show in Season Two.

Around Episode 8 or so the two sections of the plane reunite in a stunning scene.  You figure sparks are really going to fly.  After all, how many leaders can you have on such a small island, but things become surprisingly tepid.  The writers appear content to tread water until Danielle discovers an odd little man in one of her traps and so we are introduced to Henry Gale, who claims to have fallen to the island from a balloon.

This leads to an astonishing number of discoveries on the island.  Michael (one of my least favorite characters) returns after his search for Walt, demanding that a select few of the Losties join him in the continued pursuit of his son, resulting in a shocking final three episodes that pretty much read as one entity.  Abrams and co. really know how to come up with a gripping season finale.

On the whole, I would say this is the best season of the series.  It was certainly the most compelling, as it introduced strong new characters and extended the storylines in interesting new ways.  One tires of some of the characters but that is to be expected when you have such a large ensemble cast.",1242950400,,2844,4.562992125984252

2569094,5,B000FIMG68,"Warning: Spoilers for both Seasons Two and Three!

Season Two of LOST was a very strong follow-up to one of the most impressive new shows in several years. It has also proven to be one of the most interesting television series on multiple grounds. For instance, it has taken the serial format to perhaps its logical extreme. If at one end of the narrative spectrum you have LAW AND ORDER, a show that each week features a completely self-contained episode that leaves no plot or dramatic conflict unresolved (a format I will confess to utterly detesting), at the other you have LOST, a series that will only complete its story when it comes to an end. Comparing these shows to literature, LAW AND ORDER could be compared to a large collection of short stories. A show like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which more or less told a single major story each season, could be compared to a sequence of novels. LOST, on the other hand, could be compared to a massive epic novel like WAR AND PEACE or LES MISERABLES. Is LOST a great show? Given this narrative structure, we honestly don't know yet. It is the only show that I know that can only be properly judged when it comes to an end. We can say this: this has a chance to be one of the truly great shows in television history. What we can say so far is that Seasons One and Two have been wonderful components of what we can only hope will be a great story.

If we thought we knew what LOST was about in Season One, Season Two proved us wrong. We knew that there were people that Rousseau referred to as ""the Others"" and we knew there was a hatch, but little did we realize that the island was perhaps (I say ""perhaps"" because we still aren't really sure) the setting for an elaborate set of social experiments, complete with covert observers. We also learned that the island was in fact home to multiple hatches, each with a distinct function. We further learned that the original group of survivors was not the only one from Flight 815 to survive the crash; we are introduced to a group of people commonly known as the Tailenders. As the season progressed, the number of new twists and revelations continued to mount. My only complaint with this has been that given the extremely large (and continually growing) cast we sometimes lose contact with the various individuals. Give a choice between a plot-driven and character-driven series, I'll always opt for the latter. Indeed, the stated intention for LOST was for it to be a character-driven series, but I'm not sure they have always maintained the proper balance. Mainly this is simply the result of the gigantic cast.

There were many new characters in Season Two, as well as a host of guest appearances in the various flashback scenes. (On a purely personal level, I was especially delighted by the brief appearance of Wayne Pygram in the Rose and Barnard flashback episode. Pygram played one of the truly great villains in TV history as Scorpius in FARSCAPE. The delight in LOST was that he spoke in his normal accent and with minimal make up, while as Scorpius he appeared in heavy make up and spoke in a highly cultivated accent.) We had six major new characters introduced. First we met inside the hatch Henry Ian Cusick's character Desmond, who promptly disappears until the end of the season. Although the season ends with Desmond apparently dying, the fact that Cusick has been announced as a full time cast member sort of takes the suspense out of whether he survived or not. Interestingly, Desmond's last name is Hume, joining Locke and Rousseau as characters sharing last names with major 18th century philosophers. We then met four major new characters among the Tailenders, Michelle Rodriguez's Ana-Lucia, Cynthia Watros's Libby, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Mr. Eko, and Sam Anderson's Barnard, the oft-mentioned husband of Rose. Fans of ANGEL were delighted to discover that Barnard was played by the same actor who so memorably portrayed Holland Manners, the elegant but thoroughly evil head of Wolfram and Hart. Last but certainly not least, we met one of the Others, Henry Gale, portrayed magnificently by Michael Emerson (who has been announced as a fulltime cast member for Season Three). All of these characters brought a great deal to the show, though considerable controversy arose when Rodriguez and Watros were both arrested for drunk driving. This was especially troubling in Rodriguez's case because of prior drunk driving convictions and possible violation of probation. There is a widespread belief that both their characters' deaths later in the season were connected with the arrests. The fact that both characters seemed to leave the show prematurely certainly bolsters that belief.

The producers have already informed us that while Season Two was about the Hatch, Season Two will be about the Others. Hopefully it will also deal with two major events from the season finale. Throughout Season Two Locke and others had diligently been resetting the timer inside the bunker, but in the finale they let it go all the way down. Show runner and co-creator Damon Lindelhof has already acknowledged that this was an incredibly important event, the ramifications to be dealt with in Season Three. He has confessed that on a scale of importance from 1 to 10, allowing the numbers to go all the way down was a 10. But perhaps even more interesting, the event triggered by the numbers going down resulted in a detectable event elsewhere in the world. The very last scene of Season Two was of two men surrounded by scientific instruments detecting the event on the island, showing for the first time that there really is still an outside world. Furthermore, one of the men then made a phone call to the woman we learned in a flashback was the extremely wealthy woman with whom Desmond was in love. In other words, she is searching for Desmond. So in a new twist Desmond could prove to be the most important character on the show.

I have to confess that Season Two did for the first time create some uneasiness for me about the show. First and foremost, I have been troubled by the deaths on the show. We all remember a time when characters were simply not killed on shows. THE X-FILES was the first show I know that killed off recurring characters, first Deepthroat, then later X, Krycek, the Elegant Man, and other supporting characters (just how many times did the CSM die?). But none of these characters were people we had come to care for deeply. Then BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (along with its spin off ANGEL) raised the stakes by killing off characters we cared about (I still remember the shock I felt when Jenny Calendar died). Now on most really good serial format shows major characters die. BATTLESTAR GALACTICA currently does this better than any other show on TV. LOST, on the other hand, has some of the worst deaths of major characters that I have ever seen. Boone's death was the only one that seems justifiable on narrative grounds. Sharon died with much of her story left untold or unresolved. But the real crime was with the death of Ana-Lucia and Libby. Granted many fans did not like Michelle Rodriguez's character and there was a very real chance that she was going to be jailed because of violation of her probation, thus imperiling her involvement in Season Three. But Ana-Lucia was introduced as if she were going to be a major character, some storylines were laid out that by all rights should have taken some time to spin out, and she was introduced in the show's structure as if she were going to be integral. Then she was just killed off. It just didn't feel right at all. Libby's death was nearly as bad. We were given some tantalizing hints about who she was and her background, but then was killed off even before we had a flashback episode for her. On top of all this, J. J. Abrams, who was not involved in Season Two due to his work on MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 (his involvement in Season Three will be minimal due to his upcoming STAR TREK film, which tragically might also take the real creative genius behind the show, Damon Lindelhof away from LOST), stated a few days before Ana-Lucia died that Michelle Rodriguez's place on the show was not endangered by her arrest. All in all, the entire Rodriguez-Watros affair just smelled and I'll confess that I believe the two were punished for their perceived sins. I'm just a big nervous now given Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's recent DUI arrest. His character is probably too established for them to cavalierly kill him off, but added to rumors that Maggie Grace's character was killed off for some prima donna behavior on the set, one wonders if this is an unusually intolerant production. Rumors are frequently wrong, but what is incontestable is that people usually die on this show in ways that don't especially advance the plot.

There is one cause for hope in Season Three. The end of ALIAS has freed up some of that show's production talent to come over to LOST. Drew Goddard, one of the most spectacularly gifted writers on television (he first came to public notice in Season Seven of BUFFY, where as a new writer he wrote most of the best episodes, including the memorable ""Conversations with Dead People"" and the great Spike episode ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" while on ALIAS was tabbed to write the series finale). Goddard will almost certainly gain a reputation as LOST's best writer. He did contribute one episode for Season One, the superb script for ""Outlaws."" With the danger of much of the creative team of LOST leaving for the STAR TREK movie, the addition of someone with Goddard's abilities is comforting.",1237075200,,9616,4.741338112305854

Season 2 brings us to the famous discovery of the hatch, Desmond, and infamous Henry Gale (an other??) I am not going to spoil any of the details if you have not watched. As the show developed into season 2 you really got a feel for these characters. Who they are, what they were made of , and how far will they go for themselves or each other. The answers come slow, but they do come and when they do, they are beyond words.

This show requires patience and time. If you can sit back, relax and pop the DVD in you will be hooked. Trust me! It could def get frustrating at times and make u ask yourself ""OK what the HELL is going on?"" but at the end of the day you realize how important each episode truly is and how much knowledge you get with every season.

2569099,5,B000FIMG68,"The real identity of the bruised and longsuffering ""Henry Gale"" the bug-eyed mystery man allegedly from Minnesota might've been the best storyline of this season, but there was a lot else going on during Lost's twenty-four episode sophomore outing. Season two saw the mysterious hatch opened, introduced new characters and explored in greater depth who the people lost on the island were. Then there was the tail section gang, headlined by the tiresomely ill-tempered Ana Lucia, but including the fascinating Mr. Eko, Libby the ""clinical psychologist"", Bernard---our old friend Rose's husband---and a couple dozen more, all of whom inject fresh content into the series and many of whom....meet interesting and sudden ends. Season two might arguably be the best so far in Lost, and it's certainly the one in which the most seems to occur. There's the countdown, the hatch, the cursed numbers, the Others, Desmond, the tail section people, some truly significant flashbacks, and a cliffhanger conclusion that must've brought sheer torment to those waiting for season three to start---lucky us, we only have to put in the next DVD. Special features on disc seven are ""hosted"" by none other than the Dharma Initiative's own Francois Chou, and include bloopers (which I don't like to watch, but that's just me) location shots, a dictionary of all things Sawyer-ism, and deleted scenes.

2569107,4,B000FIMG68,"Before I say anything else, there are two things you need to know about this set:
1) A subpar LOST episode still better than 90% of the shows on television today.
2) Because of the show's nature, anyone interested in seeing future seasons (which are *really* good) has to watch this set.  LOST isn't the type of show you can skip a few episodes and hope to understand what's going on.

Now that I've gotten all that out of the way...

This season was a big disappointment.

After an incredible, Emmy-winning and immensely popular first season, it became clear that LOST was going to be one of ABC's top shows for quite some time.  The problem with that is that LOST, more than most shows, needs a definitive ending.  There needs to be a point where we find out definitively what happens to all the characters, and get answers to all (or at least most) of our questions.  But with pressure to keep such a ratings giant on-air as long as possible, the writers needed to keep a tight control on the flow of answers, leading to a season that feels dragged out.

For every answer you're given on LOST, at least one more question arises.  For instance, the season opener answers one of last year's big mysteries: what's in the Hatch?  But as soon as you find out, you are left with a ton of new question about who the heck built it and why.  This sort of thing used to be entertaining, but as the season progresses the balance between answers and new mysteries gets thrown way out of whack.  We are given many, many more questions than answers, and after a while it starts to get frustrating.

This season also introduces of a group of survivors from the plane's tail section to decidedly mixed results.  Some, like the Nigerian priest/mystic Mr. Eko (excellently portrayed by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), are fascinating and bring a new layer of intrigue to the show.  Others are not so enjoyable, particularly the obnoxious ex-cop, Ana Lucia.  Her backstory is awful, her tough-girl attitude seems cliched, and the actress who plays her, Michelle Rodrigez, CANNOT ACT.  Her line readings are all identical and unconvincing, and the attempts at making her sympathetic fall flat.  She looks even worse in comparison to the rest of the cast, which continues to be stellar.

Luckily, she is somewhat offset by the season's best new character, the deliciously manipulative Henry Gale.  Brilliantly underplayed by Michael Emmerson, Gale's scenes are the most riveting part of the season.  You won't what he does, and yet you can't help but marvel at just how expertly his mindgames trick the other characters into doing exactly what he wants.

Although it is not as good as the first season, Season 2 of LOST still has a lot to offer.  They don't come as frequently as you'd like, but you will get answers to some plot threads leftover from last season.  And it's still fun to try and glean as much information as possible from every visual hint and cryptic piece of dialogue.  The interactions between the main cast (particularly the Jack-Kate-Sawyer love triangle and the science vs. faith feud embodied in Jack and Locke) continue to be fascinating and expertly acted.  The run of episodes leading up to the season finale is tension filled and has more than a few surprise deaths.  And the production values and on-location filming continue to be breathtaking.

This set also comes with a decent set of extras, although I do question their choice of which episodes to do commentaries on (the ones chosen seem neither particularly good or important to the plot).  Overall, fans will not regret buying this set, even if it doesn't quite live up to the admittedly high standard set by season 1.",1222214400,2,3682,4.7272727272727275

When I am watching my second  season of Lost that I purchased right here at Amazon.com, I am dropped into a world of mystery and terror!

2569116,4,B000FIMG68,"Season two of Lost is quite enjoyable, but with some shortcomings.  Overall, the series is quite intelligent science fiction with tight writing and sophisticated character development.  Season two is not as successful when the flashbacks are redundant.  Some characters, like Jin and Sun and Locke, have flashbacks that continually reveal new information and story lines.  This keeps the show fresh and interesting.  Other character flashbacks, like Hurley and Charlie, rehash the same themes as season one making those episodes less interesting.  Claire's character also becomes really lame and whiny.  If all the characters had new themes to their flashbacks it would have been more engaging. The introduction of new characters like Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) were not that great.  Her character is too dominating and violent.  In Season two guns start to dominate the action elements of the show, which I do not care for. Part of the show's appeal was that it was ""primitive"" and the survivors had to be creative with what they used to survive.  Every show on TV these days seems to involve gun violence, and Lost starts to follow that clich.  But, overall, the show remains well done and interesting and Season 3, and especially season 4 are great.",1209600000,,1256,5.107843137254902

2569121,5,B000FIMG68,"I have to admit, the second season of ""Lost"" is pretty hard to review.  Thing is, its pretty much the same animal as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season/dp/B00005JNOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season</a>.  The only difference is that there's more characters involved and the mystery just keeps growing.  The basic conclusion I've come to is that anyone who enjoyed the places that the story was taken to in the first season will be pleased with this season.

Those who criticize this show as never solving the many mysteries that create the backbone of ""Lost"" are very simply wrong.  This season answers more in the first episode than you'd expect would happen until episode twelve.  Throughout the season, you'll find out answers to questions such as this:

+ What is in the mysterious hatch?  What does it have to do with the island, and what makes Locke think his fate is inside this hatch?

+ What ever happened to the tail section of the plane?  Was Rose right to have faith that her husband (who was in the tail section) is alive, or are they all dead?

+ What happened to Claire when she was kidnapped?  Was it the Others that let her go and, if so, why?  Or did she escape on her own?

+ Is there more significance to Hurley's 'lotto numbers' than everyone seems to believe?

Those who weren't convinced by the first season of ""Lost"" won't find many differences between this season and the first.  There are still a lot of mysteries by the time this season finishes--if there weren't, it wouldn't be ""Lost""--but the creative force behind this show gives us just enough to keep us satisfied.  As far as I'm concerned, ""Lost"" is one of the best acted, best written, and best directed series on television.  It's visually astonishingly... and it also knows how to play your heartstrings.  It may not have been the best show of the year--that goes to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veronica-Mars/dp/B000FL7CAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veronica Mars</a>, which ""Lost"" fans would very much enjoy--but it easily makes any television fan's top five of the '05-'06 season.

2569146,5,B000FIMG68,"I avoided Lost for a long time as I didn't want to invest in a serial without knowing there would be some conclusion.  We know there are at least three seasons of Lost, and so I bought season 1 and 2.  I got caught up in both seasons.  I am impressed with the writing, the dialog and formula on how each character is featured and we learn more and more about the mystery as we go along.  Beyond the vehicle of mystery, you watch the development of amazing actors and writing developing the characters.  As a small example, the pregnant woman who normally falls into a sweet daisy flower category, was kidnapped and later escaped.  She lost her memory of the incident, and had an episode where she went back to the place where she was abducted.  You could finally see her determination and strength to face the demons of her kidnapping.  We learn more about the island through each episode along with the cross-stories and history that tie all these unrelated characters together.  You can see the potential in characters development beyond the stereotypes they fall into.  Things hop along with great action and story development and perspectives.  No character is sacred and there are some shocking storylines.  There is this mystery set up about the island so I believe there is always potential that noone dies and is mysteriously healed!  The island itself is a character and is so beautiful in the locations filmed.  It is interesting to see this grove of trees where the characters hide a lot get thinner and thinner.  There are some inside jokes played in this season Charlie gets lines about, such as, ""Didn't you see the polar bear?""  I love the development of the Korean couple and how dynamic (and hot!) they are.  The Korean husband without his shirt can rival Sawyer.  There is brutality and sweetness in this couple's story and in all the stories.  I like the ending of Season 2 how they turned one major character and made him deeper and yet you could understand the dilemma.  Season 2 does leave the innocence of the first season and delve into the mystery deeper.  You meet other survivors and new characters and clear up some clues left from Season 1 as you continue.  Movie-quality acting, storytelling, and special effects.  Exciting and dynamic.  Humorous and sweet.  Shocking and brutal.  I am hooked.  I love this show.",1187481600,3,2342,4.718518518518518

The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!
Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture,  Good and Evil are, all, in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable.
Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.

If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).
If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.

PREVIOUSLY ON LOST - by the end of last season, the survivors of Ft. 815 reached a crisis.  Locke blew off the top of the mysterious hatch using barely stable dynamite (as it ages, TNT ""sweats"" nitroglycerin, and the stuff that Jack and Locke find looks like it spent a few years on a treadmill), but finds more mystery within.  Michael, Walt, Jin and Sawyer, having escaped on Michael's raft, encounter another boat.  Elation quickly turns to terror - Walt is taken and the others are cast adrift.  We knew that the survivors were not alone, but we learn how ""The Others"" are powerful, determined and unfriendly.

In Season 2, we meet more survivors.  We also learn more about the mysterious and hostile ""Others"" - but are we really learning the truth?  (After a season, we already know not to believe everything we see.)  If you loved Hurley's spotlight story last season, there's a great sequel.  And of course we finally go down into the mysterious hatch, where some questions are answered, but many more raised.  ""Lost"" is a lot like The Hatch, keeping us going by showing us just enough - no captain's log, no tell-all tricorders, no voice-overs.  Comfy closure is for ""Grey's Anatomy"".  This is a show for viewers who like a challenge.  The season ends almost perfectly - without giving away too much, there's a perfectly paced climax that weaves themes and backstories of several characters, and sets the stage for Season Three.

ARE YOU LOST?
""Lost follows the unfortunate survivors of Oceanic 815.  Stranded on a mysterious island, they soon realize that quick rescue isn't likely as their flight had gone off-course for some distance prior to the crash.  Apart from the dangers of being on an unpopulated island, ""Lost"" added some new wrinkles - a crazy French woman named Danielle (whose voice plays on the recorded message picked up early last season), an invisible monster, a weird hatch barely buried underground and (above all dangers) the terrifying clues that our survivors are under attack.  ""Lost"" excels for the very reason usually used to explain why other shows fail - because it shifts gears quickly, from funny to sad, sentimental to ominous.  The show doesn't overload you with surprises, but has no shortage of them.

But ""Lost"" is also great character drama - weaving the challenges of the island with the complex back-stories of individual characters, each of whome challenged our shallow perceptions them - Sawyer, the schemer; Jack, the doctor who fix anybody; Sayyid, the soldier; Charlie, the has-been rocker turned junky; Kate, the murderess; Locke, the visionary who seems oddly at home on the island; and Hurley, who gamely resists being the comic-relief of the show.  Each episode continued picking away at the past-lives of our characters, sometimes revisiting previously seen moments of their lives - making us wonder if they're better off being Lost for good.",1182384000,3,2975,4.921843687374749

Seems to me that the writers/producers had a nice idea and never expecting such a huge success, decided to make the story several seasons and chapters longer by filling it up with soap opera situations along with ideas and characters that were not initially conceived.

The producers themselves confess that they didn't have a clue on what was the infamous hatch and what was inside of it, so they made the story along the way (two thumbs down for that!)

And yes, strange things continued to happen. Some deaths, the Tailies meeting up with our regulars on the beach, a pregnancy, another healing, and some strange dealings with the Others.

In the end, though, we're left with even more questions than we were left with at the end of Season one:

Did Michael and Walt really escape the Island, and will they be rescued?

What happened to Locke, Desmond, and Mr. Ecko? Did the Hatch really explode?

Does Hurley make it back to camp to warn his people not to hunt the Others?

What will the Others, seemingly led by ""Henry,"" do with Jack, Sawyer, and Kate now that they have them?

What happened to Sayid, Jin, and Sun aboard the boat?

2569162,1,B000FIMG68,"Caught half a new episode by accident and it's reminded me how unwatchable the show is and maybe enabled me to better articulate why.

My major beef with Lost is the overuse of one-shots. Almost every time someone is speaking no-one else's face is allowed in the shot so it creates the effect of just one person talking to the camera. You never see the other participant in a conversation reacting while someone is speaking, like whether they're rolling their eyes or nodding or whatever, so it doesn't feel like a conversation. The directors apparently think their audience is too stupid to follow two characters emoting/acting at once.

Also the sets and especially the ambient noise give such a fake sterile atmosphere.

And the fact that the writing is so dull, plots are so slow, and characters have no personality.",1178755200,9,820,4.8428571428571425

2569166,5,B000FIMG68,"I'm a latecomer to Lost - I discovered it early in the 3rd season, after my son bought me the first season DVDs for my birthday. I generally watch very little television -- the Daily Show and Colbert, and the occasional SNL are about the sum of it. That is, until I discovered ""Lost.""  It is brilliant and gripping and fun...with a level of complexity and creative intelligence that rivals a great modern novel. Oh, sure, there are some facile elements, some convenient coincidences that will raise the occasional eyebrow. But for TV -- this is as good as it gets. Now, regarding the 2nd season per se: a few have complained that it's too complex. Some have complained that it doesn't have the quality and cohesion of the 1st season.  I utterly disagee -- the 2nd season is taut, fascinating, exciting, and completely coherent, IMO.  The ""Hatch"" story line was totally absorbing, and the character development proceeds apace, throughout the season.  I do think it's easier to take in the 2nd season on DVD, as opposed to watching one show per week. It's more gratifying, that way, too. So buy this collection. You will be glad you did, whether you're seeing it for the first time, or reviewing, or catching up, or ""hunting for Easter Eggs.""  And if you have a family to watch it with, make it a bonding experience with them. I've watched all of ""Lost"" with my wife and kids. We've had a great time with it.

One note of warning: always ""Lost"" episodes in order! And certainly, watch the first season before purchasing this set.",1176163200,3,1527,4.637037037037037
2569167,5,B000FIMG68,"Watching the whole series on DVD was even better the second time around.  I loved watched it on TV, but watching these amazing episodes back-to-back is so addicting.  It is great and this is the greatest show ever.  The DVD has great bonus features, and it has great deleted scenes.  If you love LOST or want to start watching it, then you MUST buy this!",1175385600,2,354,4.4
2569168,5,B000FIMG68,"Unpredictable, exciting, full of surprises, and engaging characters are just a few of the reasons Lost is my favorite television show. It is the show that made me watch television again. I truly do not understand when people say the second season was a bit of a slump from the exceptional first season. I think it is a more than worthy continuation. The second season builds the island mythology (the secrets of the hatch) while enriching it's characters with new views into their personal lives. It also introduces a handful of new characters. Which brings me to the character of Ana Lucia played by Michelle Rodriguez. A lot of people did not like her too much, but I didn't mind her. She was certainly flawed, but to not like her just because she isn't nicey nice and cutesy like most of the Stepford Wife female characters of TV is no reason to hate her. I found her compelling and interesting. The major plot twist involving her and another new character was one of the most shocking moments I ever experienced watching TV. Who knew that was going to happen? Some mysteries get resolved (like what Kate did that made her a fugitive) while others just begin (the character of Ben/Henry is introduced). And speaking of Kate, was it me or did they soften her character this season? The ""do I like Sawyer or Jack?"" subplot grew stale quickly, and I just thought this is not the Kate I knew from the first season. Thankfully, season three has brought back the Kate I love. (Evangeline...call me!) The DVD transfer of picture and sound could not be better. The extras are interesting (particularly the six degree game). And the final episode...wow! What a cliffhanger.

I took breaks to TRY and spread it out, but it didn't work. I love this show with all the diffrent mysteries and how EVERYTHING and EVERYONE is connected. My group of friends all watch by themselves and then we get together and discuss what we watched. We are THAT into this show. I love how all the characters make the show. There is NO one main character, though I do believe that some people would beg to differ. I do not think so because without the backgrounds and personalities of everyone, the ""island"" would not be what it is.

2569185,2,B000FIMG68,"I liked the first season but the second takes the most annoying parts of the first and magnifies them ten-fold.

What is this that I hate? The fact that individual characters come upon some secret knowledge, or come into the posession of something vital, and then decide to tell no one about it. For instance, Charlie finds a stash of medicine complete with injector gun. Does he tell Jack the doctor? No. He gives the whole lot to Claire who then decides to regularly administer these to her baby. And she doesn't tell the doctor either.

Like the 'hatch' in the first episode where Locke and Boon decided to keep knowledge of this to themselves the viewer can only be frustrated by knowing more of the picture but seeing the characters stumble from one disaster to another simply because all of them are acting on partial knoweldge.

I was so annoyed by this. I feel several hours of my life were wasted as I waited at least for the last four episodes of season 2 to redeem the series.

Trust us - you'll have trouble tearing yourself away even then. The characters we've loved, hated and drooled over are joined by a few new faces as the series builds again through flashback and suspense to a fantastic cliffhanging conclusion.

The audio is clear, but the surround experience is lacking. But really, this is not a big deal.

The developing of each of the characters stranded on the island continues to be outstanding while new characters from the tail section of the airplane stranded on the opposite side of the island are added to the mix of character development as well.  The new characters are only mildly interesting with the character of LA policewoman, Ann Lucia being down right annoying after a while. However, the Nigerian character of Echo by the end of the season becomes one of the most interesting characters in the whole show.

The extras on the DVD aren't enough to warrant buying the DVD package if you have already seen the series, but if you are like me and due to work you can't sit down every week to watch the LOST season the DVD package is absolutely best way to go.

Somehow, the most far-fetched, psuedo-science fiction story lines survive because the writers constantly surprise us with completely unexpected twists. As soon as you might think you know what is happening to the survivors or to one person, there is a complete shock or plot-twist making you re-examine what you think is happening. With both spiritual & psuedo-paganist themes, this is a highly interesting series, and a superb examination of human-nature & character study. Just as you can't ever be sure of the plot lines, it is also a credit to writers of ""Lost"" that people whom you might be inclined to judge early, turn out to show inner complexities and mixes of nobility & flaws.

About the story: for the ones who die after mistery and don't need explanations above all, this is there right place where to look. In second season we're going deeper in the secrets of the island and will meet a bunch of new and exciting characters, but...

For the ones who like to UNDERSTAND, sooner or later (maybe the sooner is the better), this could become a bit frustrating experience. More and more questions and very few answers about the whole mistery.

From my point of view, I really expect to get something clear in the third season. I'm getting annoyed.

Technical details: I can only say that the 'pack' worth the price. High video quality and, most of all, tons of extra material (no, of course you won't find answers here either) with some really interesting connections. I would have appreciate subtitles on the extra too ('cause, as you can see, English is not my native language), but this is a really personal consideration.",1167955200,,980,4.680232558139535

The bonus features are phenomenal, including an ""Everyone's Connected"" interactive thing that allows you to see how all the characters were, in one way or another, connected before they ever got on board that plane.

Have also purchased or received as a gift ""24"" and ""The Sopranos"".  I was very distressed that the most recent marketed version of ""The Sopranos"" was @ $62+, and that was for only part 1 of Season Six.  I felt this was a big ""rip off"".  It would be bad enough to pay that amount for the entire season, but for just a half season!  I may refuse to ever purchase it again!

It also contains a booklet, giving you a short overview of each episode. The seventh DVD contains very interesting 'making ofs' and other very interesting information about the series, introduced by another 'Orientation' movie, produced only for this DVD :-).

2569276,5,B000FIMG68,"Don't even read the reviews just press the buy me button and prepare to watch the whole of Season Two of Lost in less than a week if not a few days. The DVD box sets are one hell of a way to watch Lost. Those who sat through the episodes as they aired will admit that as one of the biggest selling TV series DVD box sets in history (also see `Firefly' for similar achievements) is better than the best of the stuff out there (at least 99% of it). Lost is comprised of some of the best sitcoms of the twentieth-century. It is part `ER', part `Star Trek', part `Twin Peaks', part `Gilligan's Island', a whole big bit of `Survivor' with real drama and yet totally unique in every conceivable way and form. Lost Season 2 is every bit as good as Season 1 and then some more because lots of important questions do get answered and a lot of things are revealed to you. Like Season 1, Season 2 of Lost will catch you hook, line and sinker. This will put a stop on every other media you watch or listen to for the next couple of days. The logistics of LOST are simple. A plane travelling from Sydney to LA has veered 1000km off course and smashed into an island strewing the passengers everywhere who soon learn from a co-pilot that their rescuers are looking for them in the wrong place. When the co-pilot is hurled into the air and eaten alive by an invisible beast who stalks the island we realize that the island is no ordinary island, and so do the survivors who set about establishing themselves and facing various challenges that befall them. In Season 1 we are left with the bigger questions of Who are the Others? What is down the hatch? What is that strange monster? While Season 2 does have an episode about the monster, and more is revealed, Season 2 is focused on the Others and the hatch, two stories which combine well and introduce a new wave of characters. Don't worry if you feel that the writers of LOST may be playing with the story to make more money, yes of course they are, if it could go to Season 20 they probably would, but things are gelling and there is a clear narrative and by the end of Season 2 you will be orientated a lot better. Even questions like why are there higher levels of psychic phenomena on the island get answered. With that said and done even though there is much in Lost that can be rationally explained, a whole hunk of it will leave you Lost and bewildered. It may be as painful as having a tooth extraction waiting for the answer to any of the major questions but they come. Of course there is the death clock element. People will die. Who do you side with and why? Who do you hope makes it and who do you secretly hope doesn't? You just don't know how things will go. The seven degrees of separation instead becomes one degree as everybody has a distinctive relationship with everyone else, including you. The ethnic variations of actors and actresses gives Lost a worldwide appeal, and deservingly so, as who can say that they don't enjoy the suspense and mystery it has to offer. In a day and age when television is boring there is nothing quite like Lost, nor will there be for some time to come. Yes we can complain that this can drag on to keep the bucks flowing but even Firefly only lasted one season. So let's hope the series gets a good few box sets together before the producers know when to call it a day on delivering on what it all means... and they better!",1165708800,,3413,4.301242236024844
2569277,4,B000FIMG68,"The first season of lost was genius.  You had an inexplicable plane crash and most importantly an entire manifest of survivors.  The second season, although a wonderful combination of episodes, has lost the originality of the original.  The second season was too preoccupied with withholding the series ""secrets"" to live up to its predecessor.  The is still great, but is tight roping between frustrating its viewers and becoming something special.",1164240000,4,448,5.357142857142857
2569278,5,B000FIMG68,"My son and I watch LOST together, one or two episodes at a time, on DVD to avoid commercials and to keep the plot continuity that is hard to do when you are watching weekly on TV.  After we finished Season One, we didn't think it would be possible for Season Two to match it.  However, it did not disappoint.  It's hard to write a review of LOST without throwing in spoilers, but I'm going to try to give the essence of Season Two without ruining any of the secrets.

Season Two finds the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 uncovering more secrets about 'The Others'.  There are additional characters.  I won't say where they come from, but be prepared for a shock.  Each LOST character carries personal baggage, has what might be called a tragic flaw, and in Season  Two, these flaws begin to get larger on some and to be overcome by some.  Also, some characters deviate from what makes them good and become almost bad.

The writing and acting are outstanding.  It never ceases to amaze me how much of the acting on LOST is not spoken.  The characters give 80% of their communication and clues about themselves through the way they react before speaking, or their body language, even such little things as a raised eyebrow.  This minimalist dialog requires great acting, and the LOST cast is one of the best.  They certainly justify what must be a gargantuan payroll for the producers.

There are more twists and turns on Season Two than Season One, which had to spend more time on character development.  Be prepared to go back and see flashbacks from Season One in more detail, or from the angle of another person, and also be prepared for sequences that cross levels of consciousnes--some where you think the character is dreaming, but isn't, and some where you think the characters are acting, but are dreaming.

Great color, sound, location, scripting, acting, suspense.  Highly recommended.  Five stars.",1164240000,10,1907,4.706948640483383

2569283,5,B000FIMG68,"If you found yourself muttering the title of this review after a dizzying season of flashbacks and new characters, you're not alone. Of course, the person who actually uttered that phrase was one of the ones who made the second season of ABC's hit show a blast to be a part of.

And of course, there may be spoilers in the following review.

John Locke, the formerly wheel chair-bound, hatch-obsessed, wild man came out with those words after viewing an orientation film inside the hatch that he blew open at the end of season one. The secrets of what's inside the hatch, dangled tantalizingly before viewers as season one ended, are revealed as the second season picks off right where the first left off.

Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and former prisoner Kate (the incredibly beautiful despite being covered in mud and dirt all the time Evangeline Lilly) descend into the hatch to find a whole other world, one that they couldn't imagine was there. Doctor Jack (Matthew Fox) soon follows them and finds them in trouble and the season continues from there.

The focus of season two was the hatch and just what the meaning of it was. Locke is initially obsessed with his find, but as the season goes on, becomes aware that he may just be part of an experiment and turns his back on the hatch, much to the dismay of one of his fellow castaways.

The hatch provides many of the story lines for the season. It allows the castaways to not starve, as there is a huge pantry loaded with food. It provides a shower and an arsenal, though one of the survivors manages to take the guns for himself in a bold power move to upstage Jack and Locke in their struggle for ""control"" of the island. The hatch also serves as a prison when the survivors capture a man believed to be one of the ""others"" and keep him locked up while they figure out just what to do with him.

Season two also finished the story began in season one when Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) headed out to sea on a raft seeking help, only to find a boat with the ""others."" The Others kidnapped Walt and blew up the raft, leaving the survivors in the middle of the ocean. When we pick up the story, Jin is nowhere to be found, while Michael and Sawyer cling to the raft's remains and float among the sharks.

This story leads to the story of the Tailies, the group of survivors from the rear end of the plane. They find Jin washed up on the shore, and later Michael and Sawyer walk right into their trap. Thinking that the three survivors are Others, they keep them locked up until they can be convinced otherwise.

The Tailies include the former drug runner turned priest Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros), former cop Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) who viewers met in one of Jack's flashbacks in season one and Bernard (recurring star Sam Anderson), the husband of Rose, who lives among the other survivors. While the group started as more than 20, the Others captured a number of them, dwindling their numbers. They make the decision to head to the other side of the island to unite with the other survivors.

However, the two groups merge and tragedy strikes, as a case of mistaken identity leads to the death of one of the survivors. The addition of the tailies does introduce a number of great new flashbacks, particularly those of Mr. Eko. Ana-Lucia has a couple of flashbacks as well, and Bernard and Rose get their moment in the sun too. While Libby doesn't have a flashback of her own, she plays a huge part in two other flashbacks from other characters, and will in all likelihood be a part of the story somewhere down the road.

Along the way, Michael leaves the survivors in search of Walt, and returns a much different man, but still bent on getting his son back. The lengths that he goes to in order for his son to be returned to him are great and personally, what he does came as a complete shock to me when I watched the show on its original run. It was a major twist in the story, one that completely turned the survivors on their heels.

Former drug addict Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) and new mother Claire (Emilie deRavin) come to blows in their friendship when she finds heroine stashed away in a Virgin Mary statue and a flashback with Claire brings viewers back to her capture by the Others in season one and how she actually got away from her captors with a little help from a friend.

Sayid (Naveen Andrews) mourns the loss of a close friend and as the season draws to a close, he is sailing with Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin as they attempt to help Jack find the Others and their camp. His flashback to the Gulf War reveals a big connection with another survivor and a future flashback makes a big connection with Sayid's time in the Iraqi Republican Guard.

Hurley (Jorge Garcia) finds himself in charge of the food, a situation that he doesn't enjoy and we also get a flashback to him just as he won the lottery and another flashback as he spends time in a mental hospital. He also finds love with Tailie Libby.

We see how Jack's marriage fell apart and how Locke's relationship also fell apart. Julie Bowen as Jack's wife Sarah, Kevin Tighe as Locke's absentee father and Katey Sagal as Locke's girlfriend Helen, all shine in their flashback roles. We see how Ana-Lucia ended up in Australia and a major connection she has to one of the other survivors. We learn that the island worked its healing powers on not just Locke (in season one) but on another passenger on Flight 815. And we find out Sun is pregnant, though in a flashback it is revealed that Jin can't father kids. Possibly another survivor healed, or is there more?

As season two draws to a close, Michael has reunited with his son, while Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley have been captured by the Others, leaving the door wide open to season three and beyond.

What makes this set worth its weight are the extras. As I mentioned in my review of season one, the producers and creators of this show were thinking about DVDs the whole time, so there are a number of great extras. There are commentaries from various staff members and actors on a few episodes. There are deleted scenes, a gag reel, a UK commercial with the cast dressed in formal wear and makeup, a feature on making an episode and other behind the scenes looks at various episodes. However, the shining piece on the extra list was the Lost Connections, where viewers could view the connections between the various characters. While I had picked up on most of these connections on my second time through the season, this was still an interesting piece.

All in all, this set was fantastic. Viewers can pause and rewind little things that they want to see again and they get a great look at what goes on behind the scenes. The producers did a fantastic job of preparing this show for DVD when it was shot and it shows in this collection.",1163462400,,6952,4.526693227091633
2569284,5,B000FIMG68,"This second season is even better than the first since we are beginning to have more of the unanswered questions tied up and other lingering mysteries revealed. Yet, the writers keep just enough behind closed doors to continue the guessing game. Just what is this strange island all about? The tension is kept high and the script writing is very clever. I'll be waiting anxiously to see who the 'Others' really are and the fates of Kate, Jack and Sawyer who were left 'gagged and bagged' on the pier.

I am a great fan of Matthew Fox from his Party of Five series and Haunted as well as his films. Lost is a very good gripping and entertaining show. This DVD set is well worth the money and has lots and lots of extras on it to watch. This is a must buy season as well as Season One. I cannot wait for Season Three of which I will watch on Sky One in the UK and then buy on DVD when it comes out. All I want now is for the TV company that made the excellent short lived series of Matthew's HAUNTED to be released on DVD to, it was brilliant.",1163462400,,623,3.727272727272727

2569301,4,B000FIMG68,"With the additional cast members, the story was in danger of becoming even more convoluted and for a while, it seemed that would be so. But my biggest, and eventually only, issue with Season Two was Michele Rodriguez' character, Ana-Lucia. Shrewish in the extreme, she was not even a fun-to-hate character, as Sawyer often is. I hated her, period, and wanted her storyline to resolve itself much sooner than it did. However, the series mainstay characters saved the day. Locke is probably the most enigmatic character, and he remained so, thanks to the superbly nuanced performance of Terry Quinn. The scenes with Jack and his wife-to-be in the hospital following her surgery will rank long in my memory as among the finest of TV acting I've ever seen. Those moments make Season Two all the more worthwhile, and though I maintained zero empathy for Rodriguez Ana-Lucia through until the end, in nearly every other way, I was riveted. Bravo!",1163116800,,940,4.918238993710692

2569303,5,B000FIMG68,"Season 2 begins with an element viewers will be familiar with from the previous season, but who is this new character and what is this strange place he's in. The hatch itself could have been enough to keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but then we start to learn more about Charlie and his Heroin-Addicted Brother. Mr. Echo and his dark past. Plus the Others lurking in the shadows with their spies fool the Tailles and our main group.

  The one overall reason to have this entire series on DVD also hinges on the quality of the picture. Even an HDTV broadcast of the show on Wednesday night pales in comparison to the flawless production on DVD.

  I have lent out the two seasons a few times to folks at work and for some strange reason they all seem to call in sick for a few days. Upon their return, with dark circle under their eyes; they speak only of LOST and the survivors they have bonded with.",1163116800,,910,4.323529411764706

2569369,4,B000FIMG68,"I enjoyed season 2 much more than season 1 as there seemed to be more answers, more action, more character development... simply MORE. To be honest, I got a little bored with the first season at times. It was infuriating keeping you in the dark, but then it was supposed to create intrigue. But I often found that the characters or the episode plots weren't giving me enough to make up for that deficiency. Still, I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. The second season far surpassed the standards set by the first. Not only do you learn more about the characters, the island, and the Others, but it introduced new characters, who were both likeable and dynamic in their interplay with the original ones. And it had it's fair share of shocks. Not everyone who started out in the first season made it all the way to the second. Well... Need I say more???

Supposedly the third season is going to increase the level of action and answer even more of the questions, WITHOUT posing too many new ones. If that's the case, the third is going to be the best so far.

Get this quick and get up to speed on the story so far. You don't want to miss out on season 3 and a show that promises to be the televisual highlight of 2007!",1162339200,,1218,4.291304347826087

I saw the last few episodes of season two on television and then got all caught up when the second season came out on DVD. This is actually a great way to watch ""Lost"" as you don't have the frustraton of waiting a week between episodes.

I haven't decided if I think season two is stronger or weaker than season one. I just look at it as part of a continuing journey. I am not as concerned with the island mysteries as I am with the characters. To me, it is all about how these people react and cope with whatever is before them. The acting and writing remain fantastic. And I love the way the show does the unexpected, such as focusing on Desmond, a character not seen since the first episodes of the season and probably forgotten about by most people, for the season finale. And it was a great finale.

I hope the show maintains its high level in season 3, and as long as the writers stay true to the characters, I'll be watching.",1162080000,,1077,4.223300970873787

2569372,4,B000FIMG68,"OK. I do not love Lost but in some ways season two was slightly stronger than season one. IN season one you had a fantastic pilot and then almost no real storyline. This may also be slightly the case in season 2 at times but at least the quality of the dialogies and acting makes the interaction between the characters credible (or more credible at least). While some of the mroe intriguing things in Season 1 are not exploited at all (the monsters) there is much more emphasis on the presence of the Others, even if still very little is being explained. One thing that is somewhat tiring is that whenever one point has been clarified, there comes the next unexpected cliffhanger situation which is not allways necessary. In some ways you need to watch the whole thing in one go in order to make it satisfying since the single episodes themselves do not allways make for coherent viewing.",1160784000,,888,4.591194968553459
2569373,5,B000FIMG68,"There are no spoilers in this review.

In my opinion, Season 1 focused largely on the Sci-Fi elements of the island and frequently introduced new elements to the island.  Season 2 changes to a character-development focus, though it still includes several new Sci-Fi additions.

On the plus side, you can expect Season 2 to draw you in to the character interactions.  This not only brings fans to a deeper understanding of the plot, but also demonstrates the writers can keep this show going beyond catchy, mysterious island events.

On the negative side, not a lot of questions are answered in Season 2 until the last several episodes.  But this isn't a huge negative, because in the mean time, as you wait for answers to questions, you'll have some new characters to meet and interesting plot developments.  And once the questions start getting answered, the answers are quite intriguing and worth the wait.

Season 2 also introduces a new threat from a meta-plot angle: the possibility of major characters dying or disappearing from the island.  I enjoy this, but it may lead to some of your favorite characters dying.

In summary, if you liked Season 1 you will very probably like Season 2.  And, based on what has happened so far in Season 3, it appears to be par for the course that each season of LOST will introduce some new angle on the show.

2569376,5,B000FIMG68,"I read some of the reviews on here before watching the second season on DVD, and I gotta say I was a little bummed.  I went into the second season expecting unbelievable plot points, mundane, unnecesary back story of every character, and little development of the overall story.

I found none of these things to be true.  The second season follows the successful formula of the first very closely.  It's happenings on the island balanced by background info of the main characters, which often ties into developments on the island, as Lost fans already know.  I didn't find any of the back story irrelevant, or as ""time fillers"", because most of the main characters (Jack, Locke, Sayyid) are so deep that we as viewers are begging to know more of their lives.

As for the main story, I won't throw out any spoilers here, but you might expect the 2nd season revolves around the hatch, the reunification of the two crash groups, and of course interaction with the Others.  All in all, an excellent second season that leaves me optimistic for the third.",1160179200,5,1049,4.699453551912568

Apart from the present day action, the interweaving of the flashback storylines is more interesting and the back stories are more revealing about the characters. Also, now the Lost world is known and accepted, it's much easier to get drawn in and enjoy the show without constantly having to question why or how such and such could possibly be happening. Of course, there are the usual cliff-hangers and twists, but there're also a whole host of other characters introduced... oh, did I mention `other' there? Yes, we finally get more of a handle on those `others' guys - but I'm not going to say in what way and spoil the fun for you.

Some of the characters also get it on - finally. Who'd have thought it would take so long, stranded on a desert island with nothing to do? The hatch is fully explored. There are some truly surprising plot elements - remember Boone? Enough said!

But don't go thinking you can come to this season and every question you had in the first is going to be answered. Some will be, but those will only be replaced by far more teasing and perplexing questions than you ever thought possible.

Season 3 just can't start too soon as far as I'm concerned. Until then, I'll make do with the first two seasons on DVD.

2569378,2,B000FIMG68,"It's so rare to see such a precipitous drop in quality between one season and the next that the happening inevitably raises comparisons to one of the great bottom-dropped-out series of all time: David Lynch's Twin Peaks. There you had an unconventional, compelling hour of TV that held its enraptured audience glued to the set every Thursday night with quality so rare on network TV- until the second season. And as if a light switch were flipped off, everything good about the first season became grating, meandering, thoughtless and most of all exhausting for even the most committed fans.

Welcome to Twin Peaks Part II: ABC's LOST.

Must they all bottom out on ABC? I suppose it's appropriate, as it's on ABC where that fateful shark was first jumped on a Tuesday from hell so many years ago.

Not like it matters, but spoilers follow:

A deservedly Award-winning first season has spawned the saddest of turns of events: writers without enough material to fill a full season of episodes, left to recycle already tedious plot points and meander about just daring the most committed fans to try to follow the thinnest of bread crumbs. Here, in LOST's second season, what were intriguing coincidences devolve into ridiculous hocus-pocus, made even more ridiculous by the fact that in most cases the characters refuse to show their cards to the other characters. Would there be any reason whatsoever that Jack wouldn't say to Kate or anyone else for that matter: you want to hear something weird? That French guy in the mystery hatch and I have hung out in an abandoned stadium one miscellaneous night not long ago. What's the big secret?

The big secret is that what came naturally in the first season now just looks like nothing more than TV writers desperate to stretch a mystery out over 22 epsidodes and failing miserably. It's a rule in any fictional endeavour that if you can't create consistency of character--in other words, if you must force your heroes to act out of character merely to propel a plot point or serve a writer's convenience--then you invade the viewer's relationship with the charcter and turn the character into nothing more than a device.

Good time to mention Sawyer. Exhibit A. And Ana-Lucia, Exhibit B. Already irritating characters that have enough of a hill to climb to overcome the substantial limits of the actors portraying them. But add the weight of writers who can't give them consistent traits (unless you're satisfied with sarcastic nick-name invention as ""consistency"") enough to sustain the full season.

There were so many plot holes over the course of this season you could fly a jet airliner through them. Now give me some credit, I'm more than willing to suspend disbelief for a show like this. I'm more than willing to go along with numbers that show up everywhere and all the time and whatever other dream-based (echoes of Twin Peaks, anyone?) mumbo jumbo they want to show. I'm there for that. What I can't sit with is insipid lapses of coherency to lead us into one more hysterical pre-commecial musical crescendo. Believe me, there aren't enough screeching violins to cover the writers inability to get themselves out of holes. When the nearly naked Sawyer doesn't realize he's missing a gun until he's fully dressed and back at camp, LOST is at last getting the kind of unintentional laughs that saw Twin Peaks mercifully axed at the end of its second season.

Look, there's just no mystery why this tripe got no Award nominations this year, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with changes in Emmy nomination procedure. It has to do with a fairly good show resorting to the most cliched plot twists to try to squeeze out 22 episodes when really it had maybe 13 episodes of story to tell.

I would imagine the writer's handbook looks like this: need mystery? Have character hallucinate someone from their past. Need to stretch out mystery? Have character chase hallucination into the jungle only to trip and fall. Need to create tension? Have lead characters point guns at each other. Need to ratchet up tension? Have lead characters shoot guns. Need to pull out all the stops? Rip a page from the Dallas handbook and shoot someone. Turn up squealing pre-commerical crescendos.

LOST is nothing more than a heartbreaker, and I say this as a guy who could not wait to devour the mysteries set in motion in its phenomenal first season. It's like hearing a band's weak second effort and finding it so bad that it makes you wonder if the first record was really as good as you thought it was.

I am convinced that LOST is television's version of the joke that gets the listener involved, keeps them listening as the joke goes on and on, and turns the joke against the listener because there is no punch line. Twin Peaks could never have pulled itself out of the tailspin that was its second season - and someone greenlit a movie so that David Lynch could prove it. In LOST's case, they're getting a third season to prove it. I'm not sure I will be tuning in to experience its slow death. I think I've heard this one before.",1159833600,18,5072,4.745743473325766
2569379,4,B000FIMG68,"I liked season 1 because of the mystery and suspense. There was emotion, tears, romance and leadership issues, but only at a point that suggested well-researched character backgrounds.

Season 2 had mystery, of course, answered some questions and put hundreds of new ones, but it got too emotional for my taste. I finally got bored of tears and anger in flashbacks and skipped some half-minutes at each episode. I think too much time was wasted on relationships and goodbyes during funerals instead of working on the hints and clues.

Season 2 was not bad, it's worth watching and still interesting. But if they intend to make of LOST a social drama set on an exotic island, then they've just lost one viewer.",1159660800,2,709,4.80327868852459
2569380,4,B000FIMG68,"First off i'm going to have to completely disagree with the 2 spotlight reviews and say this was better than the 1st season, for me the 1st season moved far too slowly, but the introduction of new survivors and frequent meetings with the others made this series more interesting.  I have been anxiously waiting the next episodes during this season (which I wasn't during the 1st season), and I was all ready to highly recommend season 2 and give it the perfect 5 but then the ending came and it was dissapointing to say the least.  Without giving away plot details I will say that once again the ending told us nothing and threw up several more questions, and my concern with this is that they may continue doing this season after season by which time some may have lost interest.

Despite the poor ending I still highly recommend both seasons of Lost and urge you to stick with the series even when certain episodes hit a bit of a lull, which sadly happens too often.  I also cannot agree with those calling it the best thing on TV, I find 24 a far more interesting and exciting program, which never loses steam or gets dull.  Nevertheless I am intrigued by the series and I like many others will continue watching this through to the end, even though that is likely to be several years down the line, I hope the writers continue to make it worth my while.",1159315200,4,1357,4.433734939759036
2569381,5,B000FIMG68,"If you watched season one, you don't need some clown like me to tell you to watch season two as the desire is already there. I am just here to tell you to indulge in your desire, you will not be sorry.

To those who say it falls short of season one, I say nay-nay. It builds beautifully and steadily upon it. The first few episodes do, in fact, repeat themselves simply to ensure you are up to speed on everyone's story-lines. Especially since this season introduces several more excellent characters with completely engrossing back stories. Once the ""tailies"" and the regualr cast meet, the show is off and running while staying on par with anything the fantastic first season had.

In fact, I would go as far to say that season two has one definitive thing over season one; better flashbacks. The scenes involving flashbacks won't have you waiting for them to get back to the island. Not that all of season one's did, but a select few flashbacks in season one were lackluster. I can't think of a single flashback in season two that was less than fully engrossing.

Do make sure you watch the bonus features, they are quite quite good. I am not a 'Lost Theorist' but hearing many of the theories and and creators thoughts on them are very interesting.

Whatever your expectations going into this season, you will leave it the same way you did season one; begging for your next fix.",1158969600,3,1382,4.560483870967742
2569382,5,B000FIMG68,"I really hate giving five stars to anything, but this show deserves it.  Without giving away plot lines, here is why it deserves five stars.

1. Production Quality: The location work is beautiful.  A bulk of the work is in-studio (hatch), but you feel like you are very intimate with minute details of that hatch, even into the ventilation ducts.

2. Writing: Lost spends a good deal of time in character development.  Almost every episode contains a flashback for one of the characters.  Pay close attention to these, because other lost-aways make cameos in most of them.  The story remains compelling as characters change roles and attitudes and struggle with their demons.  Some come to terms with them.  At the end of the season, the viewer is left wanting the next episode, badly.

3. Acting:  This cast does a very good job overall.  You are uncertain whether to love or hate some of these people, and you end up doing both with most of them.  Few of the characters are one-dimensional.

4. Buzz: The blogs are full of people speculating about the future...and the past.  What does it all mean?  Everybody has an opinion.

This set is definitely worth your time, and the entire family can watch.",1158883200,4,1201,4.72463768115942
2569383,5,B000FIMG68,"I didn't watch any episode on TV.  First I bought the Season 1 DVD set, and loved it so much I went on to buy Season 2.

In my opinion the greatest advantage of watching it on DVD is the loss of all the commercial clutter and interruptions.  I read one reviewer who pointed out that at the apex of a very tense scene, ABC decided to flash a grinning ""Bachelor"" guy at the bottom of the screen--what a bummer!  In addition, he pointed out that they continually remind you with the popups that it's available in HD, that you're watching ABC, plus a host of their other shows.  And that's before all the commercials.  I use DVR, so I can FF thru the ads, but even so, it's still a major distraction.

My friend and I watched the entire first season in one week, and the second season 3 weeks later.  We watched 4 episodes each night.  It was great!  I really felt like I was watching a movie, rather than a TV show.  For this reason alone, I think the DVD sets are definitely worth the price.

As for the show, it's fast-moving and combines all the elements one looks for in a good movie--great character development that makes sense psychologically, great acting, suspense, surprise, action and just enough romance (a smidgen) to make it real.  And it always keeps moving--never a dull moment.  Who could ask for more?",1158883200,4,1316,4.406639004149378

2569385,4,B000FIMG68,"The first season of Lost quickly set the pace and dynamic of the show--namely frantic, spontaneous turns of events that introduce new questions regarding the island and its new inhabitants.  Season 2 carries on and furthers that dynamic, adding new mysteries to an already very mysterious place, and it engages viewers by tying up loose ends from the first season--only to loosen more strings.

Main features of Season include the Hatch, which we discover ensnares Jack, Kate, Locke, et al in a dangerous gamble, one that weighs heavily on the characters every episode; the so-called ""Tailies"", which introduce and explore the lives of a new group of characters; and the clashing between the plane survivors and the others, a clashing that elevates Michael to one of the most important roles in the show, despite limited appearances in Season 2.  Mark it down: the developments surrounding Michael, specifically regarding Walt, pose as some of the most crucial elements to the show's progress.

Season 2 was particularly satisfying because it answered questions left over from Season 1, including (besides the hatch) Claire's disappearance, the importance of the numbers, and why the plane went down in the first place (though Season 2 leaves this question open enough to be addressed in future seasons).  That said, others remain, such as why Walt is so special and what the ""monsters"" really are.  And of course, new questions are asked: What is the Dharma Initiative? What is the Others' plan?  In between all of the above are a gamut of surprises, thrills, relationship developments, and more. Not unexpectedly, Season 2 ends on a cliffhanger that is almost intriquing as Season 1's.  In sum, a great season that will not disappoint.",1158537600,4,1737,5.091549295774648
2569386,5,B000FIMG68,"I didn't watch ""Lost"" on TV but picked up the DVD sets to watch at my leisure. As one viewer commented here, I think it would have been pretty frustrating to watch this on TV as there were times when I was also frustrated with the DVD, since I didn't have enough time to watch the episodes, one after another.

It's a very addictive show and once you start watching, it's hard to stop viewing the episodes until it's either time to sleep or do some other activity. As someone already commented here, it's like an extraordinarily long novel which focuses on a lot of detail, as the characters continue to get fleshed out through flashbacks and their actions on the island, with each of the main characters getting ample time on the screen to relive their own stories for us.

I think what's really fascinating about the series is its honesty and the way the characters are portrayed - with everything bared for the audience to see, something that you rarely see in most shows, which are quite shallow and don't focus so much on the characters as what activity they are engaged in. This style of filming lends an incredible depth to the overall production, which otherwise would suffer both in terms of the credibility of the actors and the situations they find themselves in, which are incredible, mysterious and totally unexpected, as there is a twist and turn with every step they make on the island.

As expected, some characters are well liked and there are others whom you really can't relate to or are just plain unlikable, like the cop played by Rodriguez. From the very first scene she's on, you hate her and her entire personality as she doesn't have even one ounce of credibility in her actions or portrayal. She's an extremely poor actress and I'm surprised they cast her. Sawyer, on the other hand, is a rogue and a really bad person but you can't wait to see him in the next episode, to hear what he has to say and overall, although he's a horrible guy, I think everyone likes him for that. He's one of the best characters in the series, apart from Locke, who's mysterious and driven by his inner demons. I didn't like Locke too much in Season 2 but in Season 1, as the hunter and provider, he was great. Jack seems too hyper in every scene and I do like Kate a lot. She brings a certain sauve coolness and is a perfect counter balance to Sawyer. Mr. Eko is a great character and I do hope they have something fantastic in Season 3 for him. I have always hated Michael's character, a one track shallow dad who's pinning all his failures on a professed devotion to his boy, whom he barely knows and can't be a father too as well. Ultimately, he turns out to be a murderer - a terrible, despicable man with no morals, none at all. Last, Jin and Sun are great characters. I don't care too much for the Charlie / Claire relationship and I think it would have been better for the show to have had Charlie killed off and have had Boone stay on.",1158537600,,2950,4.419117647058823
2569387,5,B000FIMG68,"The rather negative fan response to Lost Season 2 is expected, but I don't believe it's the show's fault.  It's network televisions.

The serialized storytelling of Lost is so tight and complex, that its just not meant for weekly viewing.  Almost every episode would end with a cliffhanger, flashbacks in one episode would only have meaning 10 episodes later, and stories would keep side tracking onto other stories.  When a show like this has such an out of structure form of storytelling, it doesn't help much that you can only see one episode a week.

Thank goodness for DVD season sets.

Lost - Season 2 is phenomenal and exceeds beyond the already excellent Season 1, but you wouldn't have thought so if you tried watching it on TV.  Lost was designed for DVD.  It's a show you need to take your own sweet time with, to watch at your own leisure.  It's very much like a novel in that you read at your own speed and if you miss something, you can retrace your steps a few chapters back.

You can probably say this about any show on DVD, but Lost is different in that you feel like you are watching one long movie or reading a great novel.  If you fell out of watching it during last years broadcast, it's because you were getting the story in pieces instead of seeing the whole picture.

Anyway, the show is excellent, the extras are informative, and you can finally Season 2 how it was meant to be seen.  Uninterrupted.",1158451200,3,1424,4.4728682170542635

How about ""get a life""! this season is by far one of the most boring and slow seasons of all time in TV history, not to mention fallacious. This is another example for success of a show that only ruins itself , now the network wants more episodes because of the high ratings and everyone else gets more money , so lets stretch this show until the ratings fall and then cancel it ,who cares about quality and somewhat credible storyline. I'm not surprised they barely got Emmy nominations this year ,they didn't deserve it ,I thought last year they also didn't deserve winning best drama (!?) shows like ""Six Feet Under"" and ""The Shield"" deserve it much more, but I guess you can't argue with hype , though last season was better than this one. I hope that next season will compensate on this year's lingering boredom and lack of originality.

However, I ended up putting Season 2 on my Netflix queue, and we just finished watching the last episode. (I SO wish I hadn't read all the spoilers in TV Guide! But, alas, I honestly thought I was going to chuck this show...)

Tight dialogue, perfect casting, and magnificent acting make LOST Season 2 absolutely intriguing. My husband and I would pause during several scenarios, look at each other, and exclaim ""Oh my God""

2569394,5,B000FIMG68,"Within the first 4 episodes of the first season of Lost I knew it was something amazing. Something I had never seen before both on TV and in films. So the question became: Can an original and evocative show continue to shock and astound in its second season? I think the answer is a resounding 'yes'. All the things that made the first season so new and exciting (the incredible ensemble, the always enlightening flashbacks, the unbelievable twists and turns) are back and in full swing but they have added new layers to the show as well. The main focus for season 2 is of course the Hatch that was discovered and finally opened at the finale of season 1, but also the Others (the island's previous inhabitants) play a significant role. Included in the new and exciting season 2 are actors Michelle Rodriguez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Cynthia Watros who each add their own tragic and unusual twists to the program. The seasons highlights for me include the first three episodes which all take place almost entirely within 24 hours of last season's finale, episode 7 (Titled: The Other 48 Days), episode 13 (Titled: The Long Con), episode 17 (Titled: Lockdown) and the last four episodes which draw the examination of the Hatch to a close and set-up season 3 to take yet another direction for our castaways.

As I watched the whole season back to back, I caught things I missed the first time, made connections I'd not seen before, etc. So that was great. But in reviewing the item, I'd like to focus on the DVD extras.

Their were several extras on the 7th bonus disk that I liked. The ""Fire + Water: Anatomy of an Episode"" is a 30 minute featurette which takes you through an episode from conception to filming to post-production. It has interviews with cast and crew, on location footage, and even the revelation of an ""Easter Egg"" that I had completely missed when the show aired AND when I watched it on DVD. The ""Secrets of the Hatch"" featurette was also enjoyable. It also includes lots of interviews, shows how the hatch was conceived, designed, built, and how it fits into the story as a whole. My favorite of all the features, though, is definitely ""The World According to Sawyer."" This is only about a 5 minute segment, but it shows numerous clips of all of Sawyer's nicknames and one-liners. As funny as they are in the show, they are hysterical when strung together. I found myself laughing out loud. The only thing that I did NOT like was the ""Lost Connections"" feature. The way it is set up, you navigate from one character to another to see how they are all connected to each other. GREAT concept. But I found it difficult to keep track of where you've been, which character connections you've already seen, and which direction to go next. I thought it could have been created so it was easier to follow. But if you have the patience to navigate it, you will learn some new connections you may have missed before (did you catch that Locke inspected Nadia's house - that would be the woman Sayid loved and lost.... I missed that one)",1158019200,4,1865,4.469208211143695

Both camps are wrong, as far as I'm concerned.

Sure, the whole Ana Lucia storyline/character failed miserably, and Libby didn't quite catch on, either.  But so what?  An occasional misstep does NOT translate to a failed show.  Mr. Eko, ""Henry Gale,"" Desmond, and Bernard were all top-notch new characters, and they more than outweigh any losses generated by Ana Lucia and Libby.

There were significant devlopments -- both character- and mythology-related -- sprung consistently throughout the season.  I cannot possibly imagine why anyone who was a fan of season one would have been let down by season two.  Y'all are weird.

In any case, these DVDs are DEFINITELY not a letdown.  Buena Vista did an even better job on this set than with the first.  Approximately eight hours worth of bonus-features, most of which are superb.  They also manage to be different enough fro the supplements on the season one DVDs that this feels genuinely like a new experience.

2569398,5,B000FIMG68,"Warning:  Spoilers for both Seasons Two and Three!

Season Two of LOST was a very strong follow-up to one of the most impressive new shows in several years.  It has also proven to be one of the most interesting television series on multiple grounds.  For instance, it has taken the serial format to perhaps its logical extreme.  If at one end of the narrative spectrum you have LAW AND ORDER, a show that each week features a completely self-contained episode that leaves no plot or dramatic conflict unresolved (a format I will confess to utterly detesting), at the other you have LOST, a series that will only complete its story when it comes to an end.  Comparing these shows to literature, LAW AND ORDER could be compared to a large collection of short stories.  A show like BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, which more or less told a single major story each season, could be compared to a sequence of novels.  LOST, on the other hand, could be compared to a massive epic novel like WAR AND PEACE or LES MISERABLES.  Is LOST a great show?  Given this narrative structure, we honestly don't know yet.  It is the only show that I know that can only be properly judged when it comes to an end.  We can say this:  this has a chance to be one of the truly great shows in television history.  What we can say so far is that Seasons One and Two have been wonderful components of what we can only hope will be a great story.

If we thought we knew what LOST was about in Season One, Season Two proved us wrong.  We knew that there were people that Rousseau referred to as ""the Others"" and we knew there was a hatch, but little did we realize that the island was perhaps (I say ""perhaps"" because we still aren't really sure) the setting for an elaborate set of social experiments, complete with covert observers.  We also learned that the island was in fact home to multiple hatches, each with a distinct function.  We further learned that the original group of survivors was not the only one from Flight 815 to survive the crash; we are introduced to a group of people commonly known as the Tailenders.  As the season progressed, the number of new twists and revelations continued to mount.  My only complaint with this has been that given the extremely large (and continually growing) cast we sometimes lose contact with the various individuals.  Give a choice between a plot-driven and character-driven series, I'll always opt for the latter.  Indeed, the stated intention for LOST was for it to be a character-driven series, but I'm not sure they have always maintained the proper balance.  Mainly this is simply the result of the gigantic cast.

There were many new characters in Season Two, as well as a host of guest appearances in the various flashback scenes.  (On a purely personal level, I was especially delighted by the brief appearance of Wayne Pygram in the Rose and Barnard flashback episode.  Pygram played one of the truly great villains in TV history as Scorpius in FARSCAPE.  The delight in LOST was that he spoke in his normal accent and with minimal make up, while as Scorpius he appeared in heavy make up and spoke in a highly cultivated accent.)  We had six major new characters introduced.  First we met inside the hatch Henry Ian Cusick's character Desmond, who promptly disappears until the end of the season.  Although the season ends with Desmond apparently dying, the fact that Cusick has been announced as a full time cast member sort of takes the suspense out of whether he survived or not.  Interestingly, Desmond's last name is Hume, joining Locke and Rousseau as characters sharing last names with major 18th century philosophers.  We then met four major new characters among the Tailenders, Michelle Rodriguez's Ana-Lucia, Cynthia Watros's Libby, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Mr. Eko, and Sam Anderson's Barnard, the oft-mentioned husband of Rose.  Fans of ANGEL were delighted to discover that Barnard was played by the same actor who so memorably portrayed Holland Manners, the elegant but thoroughly evil head of Wolfram and Hart.  Last but certainly not least, we met one of the Others, Henry Gale, portrayed magnificently by Michael Emerson (who has been announced as a fulltime cast member for Season Three).  All of these characters brought a great deal to the show, though considerable controversy arose when Rodriguez and Watros were both arrested for drunk driving.  This was especially troubling in Rodriguez's case because of prior drunk driving convictions and possible violation of probation.  There is a widespread belief that both their characters' deaths later in the season were connected with the arrests.  The fact that both characters seemed to leave the show prematurely certainly bolsters that belief.

The producers have already informed us that while Season Two was about the Hatch, Season Two will be about the Others.  Hopefully it will also deal with two major events from the season finale.  Throughout Season Two Locke and others had diligently been resetting the timer inside the bunker, but in the finale they let it go all the way down.  Show runner and co-creator Damon Lindelhof has already acknowledged that this was an incredibly important event, the ramifications to be dealt with in Season Three.  He has confessed that on a scale of importance from 1 to 10, allowing the numbers to go all the way down was a 10.  But perhaps even more interesting, the event triggered by the numbers going down resulted in a detectable event elsewhere in the world.  The very last scene of Season Two was of two men surrounded by scientific instruments detecting the event on the island, showing for the first time that there really is still an outside world.  Furthermore, one of the men then made a phone call to the woman we learned in a flashback was the extremely wealthy woman with whom Desmond was in love.  In other words, she is searching for Desmond.  So in a new twist Desmond could prove to be the most important character on the show.

I have to confess that Season Two did for the first time create some uneasiness for me about the show.  First and foremost, I have been troubled by the deaths on the show.  We all remember a time when characters were simply not killed on shows.  THE X-FILES was the first show I know that killed off recurring characters, first Deepthroat, then later X, Krycek, the Elegant Man, and other supporting characters (just how many times did the CSM die?).  But none of these characters were people we had come to care for deeply.  Then BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (along with its spin off ANGEL) raised the stakes by killing off characters we cared about (I still remember the shock I felt when Jenny Calendar died).  Now on most really good serial format shows major characters die.  BATTLESTAR GALACTICA currently does this better than any other show on TV.  LOST, on the other hand, has some of the worst deaths of major characters that I have ever seen.  Boone's death was the only one that seems justifiable on narrative grounds.  Sharon died with much of her story left untold or unresolved.  But the real crime was with the death of Ana-Lucia and Libby.  Granted many fans did not like Michelle Rodriguez's character and there was a very real chance that she was going to be jailed because of violation of her probation, thus imperiling her involvement in Season Three.  But Ana-Lucia was introduced as if she were going to be a major character, some storylines were laid out that by all rights should have taken some time to spin out, and she was introduced in the show's structure as if she were going to be integral.  Then she was just killed off.  It just didn't feel right at all.  Libby's death was nearly as bad.  We were given some tantalizing hints about who she was and her background, but then was killed off even before we had a flashback episode for her.  On top of all this, J. J. Abrams, who was not involved in Season Two due to his work on MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3 (his involvement in Season Three will be minimal due to his upcoming STAR TREK film, which tragically might also take the real creative genius behind the show, Damon Lindelhof away from LOST), stated a few days before Ana-Lucia died that Michelle Rodriguez's place on the show was not endangered by her arrest.  All in all, the entire Rodriguez-Watros affair just smelled and I'll confess that I believe the two were punished for their perceived sins.  I'm just a big nervous now given Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's recent DUI arrest.  His character is probably too established for them to cavalierly kill him off, but added to rumors that Maggie Grace's character was killed off for some prima donna behavior on the set, one wonders if this is an unusually intolerant production.  Rumors are frequently wrong, but what is incontestable is that people usually die on this show in ways that don't especially advance the plot.

There is one cause for hope in Season Three.  The end of ALIAS has freed up some of that show's production talent to come over to LOST.  Drew Goddard, one of the most spectacularly gifted writers on television (he first came to public notice in Season Seven of BUFFY, where as a new writer he wrote most of the best episodes, including the memorable ""Conversations with Dead People"" and the great Spike episode ""Lies My Parents Told Me"" while on ALIAS was tabbed to write the series finale).  Goddard will almost certainly gain a reputation as LOST's best writer.  He did contribute one episode for Season One, the superb script for ""Outlaws.""  With the danger of much of the creative team of LOST leaving for the STAR TREK movie, the addition of someone with Goddard's abilities is comforting.

For the record, this is officially one of my three favorite shows currently running on TV, along with VERONICA MARS and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  Interestingly, I read a column by Stephen King where he identified these as three of his favorites as well.  Good for you, Stephen!",1157846400,12,9963,4.746511627906977
2569399,5,B000FIMG68,"The first disc features an audio commentary on ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" by executive producers Damon Lindelof, Carlton Cuse, Bryan Burk and Jack Bender (who also directed the episode). They talk about the story decisions they had to make: dedicating this episode to the hatch and the next one to what happened on the raft instead of trying to juggle both in the same episode.

The third disc features a commentary on ""What Kate Did"" by director Paul Edwards, director of photography Michael Bonvillain and actress Evangeline Lilly. She keeps the track lighthearted as she jokes with Edwards. They offer mostly trivial factoids (like how she learned to ride a motorcycle for this episode) and talk about how this episode ran too long and had to be cut down.

Also included is a commentary on ""The 23rd Psalm"" by Lindelof, Cuse and Burk. They wanted to introduce a character with a radically different past than the other characters. They had an idea for Mr. Eko but once they met Akinnuoye-Agbaje it started to come together and the actor actually helped create the character.

Disc four features a commentary on ""The Whole Truth"" by actors Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim and writers Elizabeth Sarnoff and Christina M. Kim. The actors recall filming anecdotes while the writers talk about character development and the structure of this episode. Both actors speak quite eloquently about their respective characters in this solid track.

The fifth disc includes a commentary on ""Dave"" by Bender and actors Jorge Garcia and Cynthia Watros. Bender guides this track talking about character development and how it drives this episode.

Disc seven contains all of the featurettes, starting with ""Fire and Water: Anatomy of an Episode"" which takes a look at how this one was put together, taking us through the screenwriting phase through to shooting it to post-production. This featurette gives a good idea of how much hard work goes into each and every episode.

""Lost: On Location"" takes a look at ten episodes that utilize shooting on location as opposed to in the studio on a soundstage. The actors talk about how they bonded with each other as a result.

""The World According to Sawyer"" features a montage of Sawyer's snarky nicknames that he gives everyone he meets. Many of them are derived from pop culture and provide a lot of the humour on the show. This is a nice profile of this charismatic character.

""The Lost Flashbacks"" include three sequences that appear in two episodes and have never been seen before. They reveal background information on two of the characters.

Also included are 14 deleted scenes from various episodes.

""Lost Bloopers"" is a collection of cast members mugging for the camera, blowing lines or forgetting them. An amusing extra.

There is a ""Channel 4 UK Promo"" directed by acclaimed music video director David LaChapelle that is very arty as the cast slow dance dreamily amongst the plane wreckage on the beach.

""Lost Connections"" shows how the various characters are connected to each other either tangentially or directly with brief clips from the show illustrating these links.

""Mysteries, Theories and Conspiracies"" has cast, crew and the fans offer their own personal theories as to what the show is all about and what is going on. J.J. Abrams and Lindelof are typically coy and cryptic. Various websites and a radio show that are dedicated to discussing the mythos of the show are profiled.

Finally, ""Secrets from the Hatch"" examines the genesis of the whole hatch subplot, when they were going to reveal it and how the actual set was conceptualized and assembled (the creators originally envisioned it akin to Walt Disney's Tomorrowland).",1157673600,25,3687,4.973983739837398
2569400,5,B000FIMG68,"I missed the entire Season One when it aired.  I rented it on DVD.  I was hooked.  I managed (I don't know how!) to shut my ears and eyes while Season Two aired.  I just bought the Season Two DVD this week and have finished a marathon session of watching it.  I wanted to be ""adult"" and try to spread it out over a few weeks ... impossible!  Like a little boy, I was glued to the television set, up until the wee hours of the morning Tuesday night worried about my favorite LOST characters.  I finished watching the season yesterday and the gears of my mind are in overdrive.

Why is LOST so good?  Because it combines some good character-driven writing with some excellent sci-fi story points.

Frankly, I haven't been this giddy over a television show since I was a little boy.

Is it me, or does LOST remind anyone out there of that early 90's adventure computer game, MYST?

Season Two concentrates on PLOT.  If you got used to your favorite characters in Season One, be prepared to give up your comfortability with them -- in fact, one of the themes of season two is CHANGE and how it is inevitable.

The most fascinating episode of Two is the ""other"" 48 days ... what happened to the tail section of the plane.  Amazing.

I actually really liked the Ana Lucia character.  Her storyline is complete and like all classic characters goes through a change for the better.  Michelle Rodriguez, I thought, did an excellent job in the role.

As for the existential questions that Season Two raises -- why do we press the button? On faith alone? -- incredible.

And, as all good dramas do, LOST leaves you hanging with a lot of questions that (hopefully) get answered in Season Three:

- Who are the ""Others""? and where is their ""home""?

- Libby: in the asylum? giving away her husband's boat?  WHAT'S UP??

- Michael & Walt ... gone for good?

- The Hatch ... is it toast?

- Why was Locke in that wheelchair?

- What happened to Jack's wife?

- Why is Charlie acting so giddy?

Oh .... so, so good.  I love LOST.",1157587200,25,2012,4.373983739837398
2569401,4,B000FIMG68,"Season 2 opens exactly where season 1 ended.  Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) are about to enter the mysterious hatch they've been trying to enter for half the first season.  Inside, they find only more mysteries, and a computer that requires their input every 108 minutes.  What do they have to input?  Those numbers that make Hurley (Jorge Garcia) so incredibly nervous.

Meanwhile, Michael (Harold Perrineau), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sawyer (Josh Holloway) are adrift in the ocean.  ""The Others,"" whoever they are, kidnapped Michael's son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) and blew up the raft the three were on.  When they land back on the island, they discover they aren't the only survivors of their plane crash.  People from the tail of the plane are alive and hiding out for fear of ""The Others.""  What does this group want?  Why have they been tormenting the tailies?

Over the course of the season, even more questions are raised.  Along the way, we do learn what Kate did that put her on the run from the law, where Claire (Emilie de Ravin) went when she disappeared last season, and why the plane crashed that fateful day.

While I loved this season and didn't miss an episode, I found myself disappointed with the first half.  Twice in those twelve episodes, they led us up to an exciting point, only to spend the next new episode revealing back-story that we didn't need and only served to slow the story down.  Then the next week they moved things forward again.  I found these backtracks very frustrating, even for a show famous for their flashbacks.

Things definitely picked up in the second twelve episodes, however.  The story began to move forward quickly, still giving us two questions for every answer.  I don't find the lack of answers frustrating.  I just hope my faith in the producers to answer everything before the show ends is justified.

Three new cast members joined the show this season.  Cynthia Watros, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Michelle Rodriguez played members of the tailies.  They proved just as compelling and interesting to watch as the returning cast members from season one.  Everyone brings their A game to their role each week, making the story spring to life and drawing me further into the web.

And this DVD set proves just as wonderful as the set from season one.  The video is once again sharp wide screen, and the sound is a very full surround.  I haven't heard any other TV show make this kind of use of the sound.  You are in the show.  If I weren't so addicted to watching it every week, it would almost be worth waiting for the season sets, they're that good.  All twenty-four episodes are presented on six discs.  Along the way, there are five audio commentaries by various members of the cast and crew.

Then there's disc seven.  Once again, it is packed full of great bonus material, including deleted scenes, bloopers, character back story filmed for this set, and the making of an episode, to name a few.

While this season wasn't as good as the first season, it is still extremely entertaining and better then many shows currently on the air.  You really do want to start with season one before watching this as everything will make much more sense.  You will quickly be hooked and counting the days until season three premiers so you can find out what happens next.",1157500800,48,3366,4.723367697594502
2569402,5,B000FIMG68,"After seeing so many generic knockoffs on TV, such as Friends/Seinfeld ripoffs in the comedy genre, Law and Order and CSI in crime dramas and ER in medical dramas, it was quite refreshing to watch Lost which not only was compelling but it actually told a story built on a core mythology rather than just case/patient/adventure/monster of the week shows. While yes, season 2 isn't as compelling as season 1, it's certainly very much an addicting show that entertains as well as frustrates at times.

The hatch door has been blown open and we discover what's inside: a computer which apparently regulates electromagnetic activity where inputting the code ""4 8 15 16 23 42"" resets the counter to 108 minutes. There's conflict over why the button needs to be pushed and we get more up close and personal with the ""Others"" as well as a new group of survivors. Some other mysteries are delved into as well as more revealing flashbacks for various characters, leading way to a big finale that thad everyone talking.

One of the things that propelled Lost besides the mythology was the character's background. Everyone had a story to tell that wasn't boring and bland. However, you started to notice only certain ones were actually interesting. For every Locke's father problems to Jack's job problems to Jin/Sun's relationship, you had mildly interesting backstories like new character Ana-Lucia, Michael's or Charlie's. And while the numbers aspect is interesting, I never liked Hurley's character at all and plus the constant ""dude"" gets irritating. ""Dude, like this is totally messed up, dude. I need help, man, I gotta eat dude"".

As usual with Lost, certain answers don't arrive, instead piling on the questions, leading for probably what's going to be a huge finale of nothing but plot revelations. For instance, the unbelievably interesting ""monster"" appears less than what it should be then there's the whole numbers thing, the interest in Walt, the Others' identity(apparently saved for season 3), the Black Rock which was introduced as a pirate ship somehow inland, the polar bear, the horse, Locke's recovery and on and on. It literally feels like the creator's are going ""let's just pile on a bunch of really cool stuff"" then realizing ""uh oh, we have WAY too much stuff to answer"". Sure it's compelling but let's get some answers in here.

While it's not a knock against the show, I'm starting to dislike the ""stacked"" style of packaging where one disc is below the other. It makes it very irritating when you want the bottom one, since you have to take top one off, take out bottom and put it in, figure out a place for disc 1, take out disc 2 and put it back in then disc 1 again. I much prefer Firefly, Buffy, Roswell and the newer versions of the X-Files which had them in separate cases. Hopefully the stacked style doesn't become as popular.

It is as awesome as season 1? Well, kinda. But is it compelling TV? Holy hell it sure is.",1157414400,7,2944,4.78740157480315
2569403,5,B000FIMG68,"Review: I have been a religious viewer of LOST ever since the pilot episode hooked me in. The show is the most intelligent and emotionally captivating show to ever grace television. No other drama has the same emotional weight as LOST. Season 1 was absolutely amazing and each episode was crafted so carefully and so beautifully.

Season 2 was less about the characters and more about the situation they are in on the island, the central plot. We learn that on the island there is a research facility of some kind called the Dharma Initiative that is run by The Hanso Foundation. We discover that the so called ""Others"" are the passengers of the tail-end of the plane. We also learn that there is so much more to the island than we think we know. We know there are several other stations like The Swan, and as we think that the survivors are nothing but a research experiment. We learn even further that the researchers are part of the experiment. Inside the hatch, a clock countdowns from 108 minutes, and every 108 minutes the code has to be input into the computer. The code is 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, and they are all numbers that play a significance in the plot. One thing to notice is that all the numbers add up to 108, but that is only one of the many puzzle pieces that the show offers the audience to put together.

Another aspect of the show are the social themes that are presented within the storylines. The first episode is called ""Man of Science, Man of Faith"" and basically is a good sum up of the juxtaposing viewpoints. We have Jack, the doctor, a man who believes that everything has an explanation and that nothing is left up to coincidence and fate. Locke believes that he is here on the island as part of his destiny, a man who was paralyzed from the waist down now can walk. He thinks the island has supernatural powers and is guiding the survivors to a certain destiny, he also believes everything happens for a reason. Mr. Eko, who is new this season, is a man of religion, a man who believes that divine intervention is guiding them on the island. The storylines support all these viewpoints so it never leans toward one opinion versus another. We also have the continuing theme of existentialism as these survivors start with their new lives and new futures, and forget about their past. The crash can be seen as a rebirth for the survivors and now each of them are finding their path on this mysterious island. We also see a social commentary within the interaction of the group. Tensions build and the group starts to fall apart from within and certain people start going behind other people's backs.

The reason why LOST is so amazing is that it holds so many cinematic qualities. The directing, the acting, the editing, the cinematography, and the music is all excellent. Michael Giacchino's score for the show is absolutely stunning and amazing, the best score for a television series ever. Each episode feels like a short film in its own, and even though each episode has a culmination at the end, it always leaves a breathtaking cliffhanger that makes your heart pace as the signature wailing trumpets come and we cut to black. LOST has characters that we all can relate to, and the emotion is incredibly real, which is why LOST is such a big success.

Many people criticized the show for having a second season slump. While there were two or three episodes that felt like they ran around in circles, it was in no way a slump. There was lots of controversy about this year's Emmy nominations when LOST basically got shut out. Last year they took home both the Emmy and the Golden Globe for best television drama. This season did present new questions, but many were answered as well. The show was just as strong as its first season, and it gave us plenty of progression. We learned more about the characters and their pasts, we learned a lot about The Dharma Initiative and what it truly is, we learned that there are ""others"" on this island but we don't know their motives, and we learn that there is a supernatural presence as well in the ""black smoke"" a.k.a. the security system. LOST season 2 is a great continuation on an amazing series.

---

Image & Sound: As I said earlier, LOST is very cinematic in its structure and in its overall nature. So, the technical aspects are as good as any film on DVD and are on par with last season's release. All 24 episodes are presented in glorious 1.78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. Picture quality is stunning with amazingly sharp picture. The 24 episodes are spread over 6 discs with the seventh disc reserved for bonus features. The bright colors of the island are sharply presented and the black levels are handled perfectly during the night scenes. The transfer is really good for a TV show. The sound mix is an immersive Dolby Digital 5.1 track as well as a 2.0 track (but who needs that?). The show comes alive in 5.1 and sound plays a big role in the show. The surround speakers are utilized and the mix is overall excellent.

---

Special Features: LOST fans know that the previous set had amazing special features. Season 2 continues that with a smorgasbord of special features. The features this time around are a little less about the making of the show and more about the plot of the show and the connections you can make with the clues. Don't get me wrong, there is a great deal of ""behind the scenes"" too. We also have 4 select commentaries on 4 great episodes. Best Buy is offering an exclusive bonus disc with the package that has a few more ""making of"" featurettes for certain episodes.

Final Words: LOST is the best show on television, that's all there is to it. It's an amazingly real human drama, an incredible adventure show, and it has plenty of mysteries that need to be uncovered. It's a television experience that is one of a kind and is not to be missed. LOST fanatics will study these episodes in hope of catching new clues they missed the first time around, and it's always good to review before the new season. Newcomers have little time to catch up, but if they cram there is certainly a possibility that they can catch up.",1157414400,39,6131,4.5402714932126695
2569404,5,B000FIMG68,"Lost Season 2 is quite an experience.  While I definitely believe that season 1 is superior, this season still has so many great episodes, and a ton more unanswered revelations about the island, the survivors, and the others.  The best part of this season is the interactions between Jack and Locke, who are both vying to be the leaders of the group of survivors.  Both have extremely different ideas and motivations, and to see them go at it is very entertaining, especially if you have a specific one you root for...  I think that this season lacks somewhat in the quality flashbacks that spoiled us from season 1.  The writers of the show had so many tricks up their sleeve for flashbacks during the first season, that I think the flashbacks in this season seem a little bit too normal.  But that is a minor complaint in the shadow of the what is the best show on televion.

It even helps to keep notes on things that seem out of place or strange so you can remember them later and peice things together.  Great writers and characters that you will fall in love with!  Season 2 has a different feel than season 1 but still keeps you on your toes and leaves you wanting more and more!  I hope season 3 gives more insight to the questions that are lingering.

Despite what others might say the second season is much stronger then the first overall.  We are introduced to a whole host of new characters - including some of the best characters in the entire show.  The infamous Henry Gale for example has already become a classic television character, not to mention the likes of Desmond, Mr. Eko, Mr. Friendly and even the often hated Ana Lucia.

This season has a little bit for everyone.  Romance, suspence, action, mystery and MORE MYSTERY.  While the first season was more about character development and survival, this season is where the true mysteries and mythology of Lost begin to reveal themselves.

2569414,4,B000FIMG68,"Lots of people have derided the second season of Lost as not being as great as the first. Well, that is bound to happen with a show as dense and closely watched as this. We should all remember that, with season 2, there were 'expectations', whereas with Season 1, it was ALL new to us. Now, here comes the sophomore season and we have ideas of where we want the show to go and what we want to happen. With the exception of the Rose and Bernard story, the second season is top notch. Thick, dense, exploratory and different. The biggest difference to me is that the first show takes place over 48 days. The second over just over 2 weeks. Cramming 24 episodes into 18 days is difficult and requires a lot of patience on the part of the viewers.

It's an amazing achievement.

That said, I was very disappointed in the extras on this disc. There was nothing truly revelatory. The cute ""Dharma Initiative"" presentation of the disc is neat for uber fans, but, who really needs a compilation of Sawyer insults? Or more bloopers? Really? Okay, so people flub their lines occassionally and break character, whoop de doo, show me something Smokey and the Bandit didn't.

The ""connections"" section was what I was waiting to see and I made myself wait until I had watched all 24 episodes to get there. What a grave disappointment. The graphic of following computer cables from one character to another is a pain and there isn't any easy way to do it. If you make a mistake and want to go back where you came from you MUST watch the accompanying short excerpt. And while it's neat to see Jack and Ana meet at the airport, the 9th time I had to see it kind of pissed me off. It's really hard to navigate and hardly worth the time.

Where is the connection between Bernard and the Pilot? We all know from the first season deleted scenes that the Pilot's mother left Bernard before he became a millionaire from selling his business. This is just one of the holes that the DVD extras doesn't fill.

The only worthwhile viewing is the documentary on the making of ""Fire + Water"", from concept to show. But Abrams is noticeable absent from this episode.

Now, granted, I haven't watched the commentary tracks yet, perhaps they are great, but Disc 7 was a waste of my time.

But, this is definitely a great show and I don't buy season packages of anything. I choose to spend my money on more worthwhile endeavors than movies I will watch 2x and never see again. Lost is different. As long as the players stay in place for the proposed 5 years, I can see myself holeing up in my house for a week and watching 84 hours of a heckuva well told story.",1156896000,6,2627,4.4041237113402065

2569419,5,B000FIMG68,"As a die hard Lost fan from the Season 1 debut, I have been a bit shocked to hear so many negative things about Season 2. The mystery of the island went much deeper and the season actually answered more questions than the first, while still whetting our appetite for more. I would love to see some loose ends tied up, but that is what makes people keep watching. Those who abandoned the show because of too many questions obviously don't have the patience required for a show such as this. In our ""quick fix, gotta have it"" society, it is refreshing to know that there is actually a show that will not simply give us questions and answers but an acutal story with strong characters and an intriguing plot. I cannot wait for Season 3 to premiere.",1156118400,54,745,4.405797101449275
2569420,2,B000FIMG68,The first season was amazing.  It had twists and turns that were always great.  In this season the twists and turns don't answer anything important.  It gets dull toward the middle of the season.  I love how the inhabitants on the island don't ever question why there are polar bears on the island(what ever happened to them anyway?) oh yeah and that smoke monster that tries to kill the survivors on a couple of occasions.  Common the writers are running out of story and they can't keep up with answering all of the mysteries they reveal.  I WOULD ANSWER ABOUT 6 OR 7 MYSTERIES BEFORE I START NINE OTHERS!!,1156118400,10,608,4.532110091743119
2569421,5,B000FIMG68,"_Lost_ is sometimes a frustrating show: too many stories, too much mystery, and not enough answers. I am impatient and so I watched S1 on DVD and bought S2 from iTunes. Even in having watched it all in a relatively short amount of time, I was felt that few storylines ever concluded. It is also safe to say that S2 was slower than S1. Watching S2 of _Lost_ will be particularly thrilling for those willing to wait. That said _Lost_ is still a remarkable series, and, despite the pace of S2, I still prefer it to S1 in some respects. _Lost_ is not only about action and suspense; it is about society and philosophy. In S2, philosophical concepts are fleshed-out and come into conflict.

Something that makes _Lost_ such a terrific show is the intelligent writing. And by this, I do not mean the predictable dialogue which tends to pop up from time to time (usually out of the mouth of Jack, our hero without imagination); what I mean is that references in this show and attention to detail are amazing. John Locke, Desmond David Hume, and Danielle Rousseau are three characters worth mentioning. John Locke, David Hume, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were all philosophers who focused on the issues of civilization vs. nature, social contract, laws, government et cetera. No themes could possibly be more appropriate for a show about people suddenly stranded on a deserted island, as people who were previously comfortable in civilized society are forced to live without property, laws, or government. As they try to recapture the essence of the familiar law and forge an unofficial government of sorts, there are many interfering factors which force them to sometimes abandon a set rules not suited for their present lifestyle.

The names of the characters (Locke, Rousseau, Hume) are of course references in themselves, but it is the way that these characters were written and how they manage to make philosophical debate spark within a popular television show which is truly interesting and all-too-rare. Not only do the characters make what their respective philosophers wrote and believed come alive, they show the conflict that arises between these different philosophical viewpoints. It is a philosopher's dream to encounter a show such as _Lost_; and to be able to see a ""what if"" simulation of what each philosopher would have done if he were on this island is a pleasure. The writers even allude to the personal lives of these philosophers through the characters, and despite the all-too-striking resemblance, they somehow managed to make it subtle, and the characters seem as if they're anything but plagiarized.

I will not go into detail so as to not ruin the experience for those who have not yet watched _Lost_.

There are also many other references -- cleverly inserted names and events -- which make the show all the more enjoyable.

You do not have to be familiar with or be interested by the references to appreciate _Lost_; but this is what sets it apart from other TV action-dramas; this is what makes it great.",1155600000,19,3026,4.89083820662768

2569423,5,B000FIMG68,"LOST Season Two Review

I'll review each episode and give the season an overall season rating.

Man of Science, Man of Faith

The Good: We find out what's inside the hatch with the great opening segment. Shannon sees Walt; the guy that is in the hatch is the guy in Jack's flashback that was running the stairs with him.

The Bad: The flashbacks were a little long; there wasn't anything about Michael, Jin, and Sawyer and the raft.

Rating: 9.5/10

Adrift

The Good: It finally focuses on the raft survivors; Michael, Sawyer, and Jin (at the end). We find out what happened to Locke and Kate inside the hatch, really short flashbacks, and a great cliffhanger.

The Bad: Michael's flashbacks were kind of boring and it left off at the same place as in MOSMOF.

Rating 9.4/10

Orientation

The Good: We find the purpose of the hatch, Michael, Sawyer, and Jin are thrown into a pit and Ana Lucia comes in, and I love Hurley's reaction when he sees the food.

The Bad: Locke's flashbacks weren't all that great.

Rating: 9.7/10

Everybody Hates Hugo

The Good: We find out that the people who threw Michael, Sawyer and Jin into the pit are the tail section survivors. Hurley finds a solution to the food, and his flashbacks were interesting. I like the Sayid and Jack under the hatch scene and Jack seeing Kate coming out the shower.

The Bad: Some slow parts and there wasn't much of a cliffhanger. Rating: 9.3/10

...And Found

The Good: The tailies are going to bring the rafties back to their camp. Jin and Eko see the others. All the tailies stuff was good.

The Bad: STUPID plot with sun's wedding ring, CRAPPY flashbacks with Sun/Jin, it seemed that when the episode ended, we ALMOST started off it the same point from the episodes beginning, and it was truly a ""filler"" episode.

Rating: 8.8/10

Abandoned

The Good: Mind Blowing Cliffhanger, Sawyer's wound becomes more fatal, and Shannon is shot. Hooray!

The Bad: BORING flashbacks about Shannon.

Rating: 9.2/10

The Other 48 Days

The Good: Everything about the tailies was pretty neat. I like the twist of Goodwin being the other and the radio scene.

The Bad: It didn't advance the story from Abandoned.

Rating: 9.5/10

Collision

The Good: I like the whole Sayid captive stuff and the scene were the camps reunite.

The Bad: The writers dragged the episode a little bit. I didn't like the flashbacks.

Rating: 9.4/10

What Kate Did

The Good: We find out what Kate did, we see the other part of the orientation film and the scene with Michael and the computer. And for you Jaters, the Kiss

The Bad: The flashbacks were kind of boring like always and I hate Kate episodes.

Rating: 9.2/10

23rd Psalm

The Good: We find out the connection with Eko and the drug plane, Eko's encounter with the smoke and Michael's conversation with the computer.

The Bad: The story didn't progressed that much.

Rating: 9.4/10

The Hunting Party

The Good: Michael taking off and Jack and others going after him and the scene with Mr. Friendly.

The Bad: Jack's flashbacks were boring and the whole episode was showing Jack, Sawyer and Locke hiking.

Rating: 9.1/10

Fire+Water

The Good: Ummm...Charlie's flashbacks were kind of good. I like hearing the Kinks in the background and Charlie's new song was good, but when the flashbacks are better than the island story, it means the episode SUCKS with the exception of the on-island flashbacks like Maturity Leave and Three Minutes.

The Bad: EVERYTHING ON THE ISLAND was a complete waste. It was so bad, it can't be called a filler episode. Heck, I wouldn't mind if they deleted on the DVD when it comes out. My suggestion: never watch it, skip it, and for the writers, NEVER make an episode like that again!

Rating: 8.0/10

The Long Con

The Good: The only thing that I liked was that it was interesting....umm...never mind that. I just didn't like sawyer conning the guns and stuff. It wasn't my favorite story line. It didn't progress with the story with the others, the hatch, or anything like that.

The bad: Sawyer's flashbacks. Nothing new. We already new he was a con-man. Didn't we already know that? The whole island con was stupid IMO.

Rating: 9.0/10

One of Them

The Good: Danielle catches an other. Sayid interrogates ""Henry Gale"" and a GREAT scene between Locke and Jack regarding the Button. In Flashback, we find out how Sayid becomes a torturer.

The Bad: A corny side plot with Hurley and Sawyer.

Rating: 9.6/10

Maternity Leave

The Good: Kate, Claire and Danielle go into the jungle to find a vaccine for Aaron, they find another hatch, we find out what happened to Claire when she was taken, and the scene with Eko and Henry.

The Bad: Nothing was really bad in this episode.

Rating: 9.8/10

The Whole Truth

The Good: Sayid, Ana, and Charlie go find Henry's balloon, and Sun becomes pregnant therefore Jin is not sterile anymore. Flashbacks were solid.

The Bad: I don't really dig the Jun romance.

Rating: 9.4/10

Lockdown

The Good: Lockdown in the hatch, Henry is a fraud, the poker scenes with Jack and Sawyer, and Locke's flashbacks reveal that Locke's dad is a con-man, possibly the real Sawyer?

The Bad: Nothing was bad, really.

Rating: 9.7/10

Dave

The Good: The TWO scenes in the hatch with Henry and others. We find out why Hurley was in the mental hospital and how he gets out. And we find out Libby was in the hospital. I also liked the kiss with Hurley and Libby. I like the joke Sawyer made with Hurley.

The Bad: Imaginary friend was stupid. You can just skip the Hurley and Dave scenes and just watch the hatch scenes.

Rating: 9.2/10

S.O.S.

The Good: I liked Kate and Jack going into the jungle to find the others and Henry messing with Locke's mind, and the getting caught in a net scene.

The Bad: Who cares about Bernard and Rose's flashbacks, there just useless secondary characters. SOS sign was pointless because it was NEVER finished. It was a pointless plot. When I first heard about this episode, I thought it would be sweet. I thought Rose & Bernard would use the radio transceiver to send out the SOS signal. Boy I was wrong; yet another ""filler"" episode.

Rating: 8.9/10

Two for the Road

The Good: Michael returns with news about the others. Ana has a tumble in the jungle with Sawyer, if you know what I mean, we find out that Ana goes to Australia with Jack's dad, and Hurley and Libby Scene And the most shocking cliffhanger in the history of the show.

The Bad: Absolutely nothing.

Rating: 9.9/10

?

The Good: Eko and Locke find the Pearl and the whole emotional scene with Libby.

The Bad: Eko's flashbacks were O.K.

Rating: 9.5/10

Three Minutes

The Good: We find out a lot about the others and what happened to Michael. A great scene with Sawyer and Jack, and Sayid catches on to Michael's plan. Lots of GOOD dialogue.

The Bad: Pretty slow story line

Rating: 9.6/10

Live Together, Die Alone

The Good: EVERYTHING! Desmond, the button, the others and their camp and we find out the outside world is still out there! BEST EPISODE EVER BROTHER!

The Bad: NOTHING!

Rating: 10/10

Overall, Season Two was ALMOST on par with Season One.

Rating: 9.5/10",1154822400,9,7123,4.646586345381526
2569424,4,B000FIMG68,"While season one was definitely cutting edge, and probably more consistently exciting than this year, season two advanced the plot, answered questions, intrigued its audience, and inspired an online reality game. The beginning and end of season two are especially riveting, though the middle of the season was a bit slow in places. Season one and two are entirely different in what they try to capture and explain. Season three, according to the show's creators, will stray from season one's mystery and season two's mythology, to explore ""the Others"" and romantic relationships. The DVD comes out a month before season three's TV premiere... catch up with all the Hanso goings-on before ABC unleashes the next round of episodes.",1154304000,8,729,5.186440677966102
2569425,5,B000FIMG68,"Every season of this show will only bring to us better episodes than the ones before it. The show could go on & on, like miles of sand, & never disappoint me.

I look forward to watching this for the rest of my life, in reruns & on DVD.",1153612800,2,236,3.816326530612245
2569426,5,B000FIMG68,"This is better then 1, IMO. If someone tells you otherwise, don't listen. Just watch and judge for yourself. (Possible spoilers ahead, but nothing major)

This year introduces new characters Ana-Lucia, Mr. Eko, and Libby as well as several other characters that play a role on the island. The 3 above as well as a couple others are survivors of the tail section. The first third of the season has them finding their way to our old group and this creates new alliances as well as rivalries. There are surprises everywhere, new flashbacks, and many mysteries are answered. We find out that there is a bigger picture then we realized. A couple organizations are introduced that may have played a part on the crash. We find out a LOT more about the Others (and actually see them).

Some highlight episodes include:
Man of Science, Man of Faith: What's in the hatch? Look here.
The Other 48 Days: Shows everything that happened to the tail survivors during season 1.
The 23rd Psalm: First flashback of Mr. Eko (now a fan favorite) and includes the first full look at the monster.
Maternity Leave: What happened to Claire when she was abducted? Look here.
Two For the Road: The last 5 minutes shocked everyone, even spoiler readers like myself.
Live Together, Die Alone: Season finale. Why did the plane crash? This is my favorite episode yet.

Anyways, this is sure to get any fan hungry for season 3. But please if this is your first time, you must watch season 1.

Oh, and I like the cover art, extra points for that.",1153353600,5,1514,4.617100371747212
2569427,5,B000FIMG68,"after i bought the first season of Lost, i became a Lost-aholic and tuned in every Wednesday to watch the show. the first season focused on the castaways, there lives before the crash, problems they had, and unresolved issues. in the second season, since we are now familier with the castaways, the show focuses more on the mystery's. like the 'Others', the hatch, the island, and everything else. the season begins only moments before the season 1 ender, we learn the hatch is like a underground home with a guy inside it named Desmond. they learn of a button that must be pressed every 108 minutes or supposidly, the world will end. meanwhile, after there raft is destroyed Jin, Micheal, and Sawyer land on the other end of the island and discover that the survivors of the back end of the plane, which we though was destroyed, are ok. this introduces new characters Anna-Lucia, Libby, and Mr. Eco. the rest of the season plays out like season 1, we learn more about the new characters, and some new mystery's. besides the mystery's we still learn more of the survivors. we learn what Kate did to put her on the run, what happened to Claire during her two week abduction, more of Sayid's past, and plenty more. the one episode i like the most was the one were we learn about the other 48 days were we learn about the tallie's. the season finale is also a great episode, and like the first season finale we are left with a cliffhanger that will leave everyone pondering over the summer until season 3. a great season, a must for every fan.",1153267200,13,1540,4.523297491039426
2569428,5,B000FIMG68,"Season 2 of ""Lost"" stayed riveting, for the most part. Many people, while watching on TV, felt annoyed by the constant long breaks between episodes. While I agree that it did hurt the enjoyment of the season, the fact that more people are complaining about the break that they did last season, where in fact the episode count is almost the same, shows that people are more eager to watch the next episode. So in my opinion, TPTB are doing their job well.

The beginning of the second season showed to many people that The Powers That Be still got it. The first 3 episodes followed the events of the night where viewers were left at the end of Season 1. It was frantic, exciting and riveting. Surprising answers and easter-eggs sent thousands to the message boards, trying to analyze what it all means. The episodes following, with the introduction of the new cast members, cut into the screentime of the core group of survivors, but it was still compelling television.

The middle part of the season disappointed some fans. The flashbacks were getting repetitive and some character were being ""reset"" to their former past. The introduction of Henry Gale's character brought new life to the show, and Michael Emerson stole every scene he was in.

Season 2 lacked a defying plot (unlike Season 1, that was all about survival on the island). Was it the merge between the two groups of survivors? Was it the clash with the others? Or was it the discovery of what's in the hatch, and the DHARMA Initiative?

As we got to know most of our main characters well enough, their flashbacks were becoming less intriguing, but it still didn't hurt the quality of the episodes. The writers began to write more out-of-the-box flashbacks, like an on-island flashbacks, an all-island episode depicting the lives of new characters, and a flashback episode for a couple who aren't even regulars.

Lost is a show about faith, and so, it is fitting that not only the characters will have tests of faith, but also the viewers. There are those who trust the writers, who say they know where they're going with the story. And there are those who are frustrated with the luck of answers, and accuse the writers with making it up as they go along.

I fall on the camp of the believers. And season 2 didn't show me I'm wrong.",1153180800,5,2298,4.647783251231527
2569429,5,B000FIMG68,"I had previously put a negative review on this show up and I still agree with the review. It was basically that I was upset that I was only able to watch the first 9 episodes of the season when it aired on ABC due to the fact that ABC foolishly had the episodes so spread out, it was frustrating... then there was the clip shows, and the aired episodes from season 1... and whoever's call it was to air the show that way... should be canned... harshly.

Yet, reviewing on AMAZON isn't about how it aired on television... it's about these DVD sets and whether or not they're worth buying. The answer... YOU BET YOUR SWEET BUTTOX they are!

Now that I think about it, season 2 was a richer season then season 1. There was so much going on in season 2 and I look back now and the writers need to be HAILED and worshipped for keeping this show hopping and twisting and moving and constantly interesting like they did.

The opening of the hatch, Desmond, the disappearance of Walt, the Ocean raft, the other crash survivors, the numbers and the buttons, the relationships and the coinciding jealousies, the Mary statues, the missing film splices, the struggles over medication & guns, the prisoner, the weather balloon, the hatch and its secrets, the Pearl, murder, Hurley & the mental institution episode, Echoes dreams, comfronting the Others and betrayals.

A slew of stories and interesting twists and turns and shocks that will have you riveted. In fact, many times during the season, I thought and couldn't help thinking that there was a little bit of a hint or an influence by David Lynch. I think, had Twin Peaks, been made slightly more commercial and a little more relatable by a mass audience, it would have a feel to it that is a lot like LOST.

Television at its finest. Right now, I'm just wondering how the writers can keep things interesting... the more you reveal about the secrets of LOST... the more challenging it will be to keep people wondering and keep people riveted.  Funny thing, I have a feeling, they'll have no problem.

You should not only buy LOST season 2, but you should buy LOST season 1 and watch them both... get caught up, because this is GREAT TV.",1153094400,2,2180,4.545918367346939
2569430,5,B000FIMG68,"It's soooo hard to watch just any other TV show and actually take it seriously now that Lost has set the bar extremely high for television.  Lost Season 2 remains compelling, gripping, and fun.  A highly advanced TV show and one of a kind (with the exception of Alias).  Although I do admit that I think the writers and editors did a better job during the first season, Lost S2 is still better than pretty much any other show you'll watch (again, besides Alias).  Watching it on DVD in particular should make the show much more enjoyable and understandable.  With no commercials, you're able to watch Lost at your own pace.  During Lost Season 2 we see;

- The castaways encounter ""the others"" more frequently

- The hatch being used

- The introduction of Dharma

- Some new characters - whose loyalties are unknown

And don't worry, there are still plenty of clifhangers making you so hungry for more Lost you might eat your TV.  If you already watched Lost on TV this year, get the DVDs and watch it again!  If you've never seen Lost, get Season 1 first, and then Season 2.

(If you're also looking for a show you've never seen, but heard is good, rent or buy Alias Season 1 and 2.  Amazing show, I can't decide what's better, Lost or Alias.  But I think Alias actually wins....)",1152835200,5,1282,4.461206896551724
2569431,5,B000FIMG68,"Season 2 of Lost was on par, if not a little superior to the first season. I'm not sure why everyone is complaining. If they answered the questions your whineing about, there would be no show. The mystery, and trying to fit the peices together is part of the beauty of Lost. This season advances the plot, in a more mature fashion than the first season; it takes 3 or 4 good episodes to lay the ground work for 1 or 2 episodes that paid off huge. What we learn about the drug plane, hatch, others, Claire, Island's healing powers, how they got there, what Kate did, etc. was great. This is probably the best written show on TV (that isn't Scrubs). I highly recommend this set.",1152835200,6,676,4.330708661417323
2569432,2,B000FIMG68,"Lost was such a breakthrough series last year and everyone here in New Zealand was watching it, it was in the top 5 highest rated shows and everything. Then Season 2 came. It was terrible. No plot advances just more questions and very little answers. They are really dragging this out to death. Now since about half way of season 2 Lost isn't even in the Top 15 rates shows. Everyone is over Lost. I watched Season 2 on and off to see if anything had changed and nope! nothing! The Season finale was also very underwhelming. I was upset that Desperate Housewives didn't get any Emmy nominations because on a level, they kind of deserved some nominations. But LOST! I am EXTATIC that it got no Emmy nominations because this can tell the makers of the show to pick up the pace and start answering more questions. Season 2 of Lost for me.....was definitley a sophomore slump.",1152662400,9,872,4.525316455696203
2569433,5,B000FIMG68,"I loved every single episode.  The answers, the new questions, the plots, the mysteries, the suspense... all written with pure brilliance.

2569434,2,B000FIMG68,"1. Character deaths that lead to nothing.

2. Drawn out mysteries with no resolutions and or terrible resolutions.

3. Redundant flashbacks.

Its all coming true and Season 3 will only be more of the same. They will drag out even the most simplist of mysteries just to keep viewers watching every week. This isn't so much a show as it is a gimmick to keep you glued and guaranteed to come back to watch next weeks set of commercials. Many of our favorite characters have regressed making their character development worthless. Many characters have died due to the dumbest of reasons making their existence ultimately worthless. The Others have turned out to be not even remotely as interesting as we were led to believe in Season one. Unless you enjoy being taken for a ride and played for a fool don't bother watching Lost. Its proven that this show isn't commited to pleasing its audience but pleasing the network by never allowing us to learn anything new without watching 15 long drawn out episodes just to learn one single thing and than they add fifty more mysteries that you know they will never plan on revealing.

Its a shaggy dog tail that can never have a satisfactory conclusion.",1152230400,17,1191,4.711538461538462
2569435,2,B000FIMG68,"I'm sorry to say that this show has been spiraling downward this past season. I was a pretty big fan of the first though. In the second, there are so many new mysteries that's it's hard to keep track, and almost no answers to any of them. I found myself getting so confused that I just stopped watching entire episodes towards then end. And let me tell you something, if you miss an episode, you'll be lost yourself. I have to say, it was a great idea, but if they don't start answering the questiosn that they throw at veiwes, they're going to burn.",1150588800,12,550,4.298076923076923
2569436,3,B000FIMG68,"Last season, Lost started out the gate as the show with the most buzz. This fake Survivor type show was full of interesting and diverse characters, intertwining flashbacks, and a mysterious island that was a character unto itself. All along the journey first season, we were surprised and shocked at all the twists and turns in the flashbacks and on the island, the biggest being that Locke was in a wheelchair at the time of departure. But something happened last season that too most of the wind out of the Lost sail, namely the finale. If the first season moved at breakneck pace, the finale slogged along for three hours as we sat and said, ""Just go down the hatch already."" We had to put up with boring flashbacks of the survivors as the prep for the plane along with a long and boring montage of them actually boarding the plane only to have the last image of the season being a group looking down the hatch.

So after a summer of complaining, the people over at Lost gave us what we wanted right off the bat, not that we knew what we were looking at. When the castaways finally descended into the hatch, we got to see it in three straight episodes, once from Jack's perspective, along with Locke's and Kate's. I was surprised we didn't get to see it for a fourth time in Desmond's flashback. And since this was the season of see the same thing over again. We also got to see the second confrontation with Zeke, Jin reuniting with Sawyer and Michael on the beach, and the token hot chick's death scene more than once.

Unfortunately season started off much like the season one finale ended where we sat around waiting for something to happen as we sit threw flashbacks that are not all that interesting. Then when something actually did happen, it was either was pretty obvious like the token hot chick dieing, or I just stopped caring a long time ago like learning how the plane crashed. And now that characters are getting their third and fourth flashbacks, they just seem less interesting. Then there was the Rose and Bernard flashback which had to be the most boring one yet. Yeah, the island has healing powers; I got that with the first Locke flashback. C'mon, couldn't we have a Rousseau, Libby, or even an Others flashback?

But as the season progress, it did get a little better and that was all due to the inclusion of Not-Henry Gale. Yeah, it was pretty obvious from the get go that Not-Henry was an Other, but that didn't stop his character from being interesting as he tried to drive a wedge between Jack and Locke. And who knew that when he reunited with Zeke and the boys that they could be so funny but I find it interesting as the Other's revealed each other's names, we still didn't learn Not-Henry's. And even though he looked to be in charge on the pier, I'm still not sold on Not-Henry being Him.

The second finale seemed like a new show onto itself as we learn more about Desmond, a character we barely got to know before he left. Then we get longer glances at the Others and we see them interact as well as new setting including the giant foot that I'm surprised why everyone is so hung up on the four toes thing. Then there was the last scene, where we got the first look at the outside world with the Artic station and the call to Desmond's former girlfriend. But with Lost, we were left with many unanswered questions as well as the answers (well, at least my speculation):

- Why did the Others want Jack, Kate, and Sawyer? (They were the one's who went after Michael, but they don't want Locke because of his former paralysis)

- What's with the giant four toed foot? (It was built by Polynesians that lived, or still live, on the island and only put four toes because they are lazy.)

- Who is Him? (Penny's daddy)

- What was with the bright light and loud noise? (The island resetting large electrical charge.)

- What are the fates of Locke, Eko, and Desmond? (Alive, alive, and alive.)

- Why was Libby in the mental institution? (The death of her husband sent her into a deep depression.)

- What happen to Cindy, the flight attendant? (Was captured by the Others)

- What's up with the Hanso Foundation and Dharma Initiative? (I think I need to watch the orientation films again.)

- Who's Sun's baby daddy? (Artificial inseminated, sperm donor - Zeke)

- Who did Carol Vessey leave Jack for? (Um, Ed maybe?)

- Why did the others let Walt leave after doing so much to get him? (Much like Desmond, they know he will be back.)

- Who eyeball was in the tailies' hatch? (Some one we haven't met)

Oh and course, there are still these unanswered questions from last year (with some revised answers from what I originally thought at the end of last season):

- How did Locke get in the wheelchair? (Shot by his dad after stalking him.)

- What is the monster? (A Hanzo experiment gone wrong.)

- Why did the fortune teller change his mind about Claire keeping her baby? (He was paid off by the Others.)

- How did Jack single handedly beat up Ethan Rom after be beaten like a red headed step child days earlier? (Ethan let him win.)

- Why would Sayid hook up with Shannon after being so close to finding his true love? (I, personally forget about any past loves if I had a chance with Shannon.)

- What's with the numbers? (Just a way to connect everyone and everything.)

- What did the French chick say to Hurley to calm him down? (Gave him some French lovin')

- Why did Claire name here kid Aaron? If she lost all her memory, what could the significance of this be? (I think the writers screwed up.)

- What did the Others want with Walt? (He can control the monster.)",1150588800,21,5611,4.433852140077821
2569437,4,B000FIMG68,"As the second season of Lost begins, the hatch is opened up, and from that moment on, the viewers are thrown into a tailspin of more mystery, eerie goings on, and everything else that made the first season of Lost so good.  While Jack (Matthew Fox), Kate (Evangeline Lilly), and Locke (Terry O'Quinn) investigate what's inside the hatch (and even more msytery arises from who and what they find inside), we are introduced to the ""tailies""; survivors from the tail of the plane that include tough girl Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), the spiritual and mysterious Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, better known as the ruthless Simon Adebisi from HBO's Oz), and others, as they come across a ship wrecked Michael (Harold Perrineau), Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), and Sawyer (Josh Holloway).  There's so much that happens throughout the second season of Lost that it's mind boggling to keep everything together with the overlapping storylines and more questions being raised than answers, all of which really hurt the first half of the season (not to mention that creator J.J. Abrams left during the season to film Mission: Impossible 3, though he did leave the show in better hands than he did with Alias), but as the second half starts things really pick up.  Characters begin being picked off, and ever so slowly secrets are revealed.  We learn what happened to Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) leaving Michael with some very hard choices to make, get a better insight into just who the ""others"" are, and we learn that the island has some connection with the Dharma Corporation.  All this leads up to the explosive season finale when the it's learned what caused the plane to crash, and what will happen as Locke challenges Mr. Eko about pushing the button.  Like the first season, the finale leaves you wanting so much more, only this time it leaves you with your jaw on the floor.  However, while the second season is wonderful television, it is a step down from the groundbreaking first season, and some of the new casting choices (Rodriguez in particular) weren't the best ideas.  Despite that though, there's a lot to admire here, and by the time you get to the closing credits, you'll be salivating for more.",1150416000,83,2201,4.866310160427807
2569438,5,B000FIMG68,"The second season of LOST does not disappoint. Most television series tend to be a letdown after a while of on-the-air time. But LOST only gets better - the way the writers, directors, and everyone else involved perfectly analyzed where a cliffhanger would fit, or what this person should have in their dark, troubling past makes this one of the best dramas of this time. Sure, it may be losing viewers because of the 'no exit strategy' sort of storyline (refrence to Entertainment Weekly's LOST-centered issue), and it was up against an 800-pound 'pop'-culture star (Idol, anyone?), but the show alone has succeeded in drawing me into the crazy, spun-out-of-control franchise. I don't love LOST just because of all the cool things they sell; I'm not that gullible. I love LOST because of the meticulously written tales of redeemption and faith, of the characters with a past shrouded in mystery and uncertainty. I love LOST because of the web of mystery the writers, creators, actors, producers and more have successfully woven, trapping me inside with the sticky threads created by the mezmerizing script, stupendous actors and just the mystery of the show overall. I mean, yeah, I used to think it was stupid (since 9/11 happened and whatnot), but after watching some episodes a bit more in depth, I realized the mistake I made - the mistake of not watching this damn show! Before it's too late - buy Season 1, the boxset, rent it, watch the Season 2 reruns on ABC throughout Summer 2006 (it's kinda late to watch the reruns; some episodes already passed), and better yet - buy/rent both Seasons 1 and 2.

**Now about the DVD itself...***

Unlike the Season 1 boxset, Season 2 delves into the actual world of LOST, whereas Season 1 showed the making of the show. However, Season 2 lacks in special features you can watch again and again and still have a huge grin on your face. Aside from ""The World According to Sawyer"" and the UK Promo (my personal favorites), there isn't much to see in the special features. LOST connections is probably the highlight of the DVD - but provides only the slightest amount of insight for the dedicated (or addicted) viewer. And it also takes long to go through, and can be very tedious at times. But the whole ""Orientation film"" touch for the 7th disc was amusing at first, but got really annoying later on. I watched disc 7 first so I was afraid the rest of the discs would be like it (gladly, they weren't).

I would reccomend you buy it if you're new to the Island (if so, I would reccomend you watch Season 1 first...) or if you're a total LOSTIE and need to show off your collection to someone else.",1150329600,17,2641,4.650963597430406
2569439,5,B000FIMG68,"While watching season one of Lost, I kept thinking that this could possibly be the best show ever made. The characters are very real, the underlying mystery is very intriguing, and it's just full of everything and anything that makes an excellent tv show.

And season two doesn't disappoint. Though we're given some answers, in return we're given more questions that keeps up coming back for more. Props to the writers for brilliant writing and good continuity. The stand-out episode for me this season is definitely ""Psalm 23.""",1150329600,10,528,5.0

Every episode is movie quality with exceptional acting and writing. Stephen King wrote an article in entertainment weekly stating that the show will be studied in classrooms one day and that it is the best show on TV since the Twilight Zone. That's a pretty bold statement but Lost does live upto it.

Surely there isn't as much character development in season 2 as was in season 1 but the second act shouldn't be about that anyway as it's time to establish the conflict and season 2 does that big time. From the capture of the mysterious Henry Gale to the mystery of whether or not pushing the button does anything this season is truly worth owning on DVD.

But do you really want an answer?On Twin Peaks when you found out who killed Laura Palmer it was all downhill from there. When you watch the specials on how magicians do their tricks it takes all the fun out of watching magic acts. So I for one am grateful that this season Lost doesn't reveal all. So what's new this year?There are new characters,new better than ever flashbacks revealing the pasts of the characters(Best episode is an emotional mindbender with Hurley trying to come with grip with reality in a mental hospital)there's a mysterious timer that counts down every hour and you must input numbers before ""The World Ends"".In the satisfying finale you finally get to find out what happens when time runs out(see they don't totally leave you in the dark!).There are also some emotional reunions and separations,Lost is the only show that can make a grown man cry(ulp,me) because you care about the characters so much.

I bought the first series on DVD not having any interest in the show when it was on TV here in Australia. I rented the first disc to watch it and see for myself, from the first 5 minutes I was hooked. This show is an instantaneous classic, and not only does the second series IMPROVE on the first, it also expands the rich tapestry of backstories and mystery surrounding our characters and the Island.

A must buy. I can't wait to own it.",1150243200,2,690,4.556451612903226
2569443,5,B000FIMG68,"There has been a lot of talk that Lost has begun its long, awkward leap over the ""Dharma Shark"" of TV oblivion.  Don't believe it.

I, like others here, did not see season 1 of Lost until it was on DVD.  With the help of this medium, I was able to keep track of the story, the characters, and the various conspiracies of the show without having to wait weeks for reruns to finish and to see those damn car commercials over and over again.  I am convinced that DVD is the only true way to appreciate this show.

What Season 2 attempted to do was to open up the mysteries of the island while still developing the storylines of each character, and in that the writers did a remarkable job.  As the episodes go on it must be difficult for even the writers to keep track of the whole story.  The past must match up with the present, which ultimately must match up with the future.  Anyone who thinks that there is no great plan among the creators of this show to have a true, sensible ending (unlike the X-Files) is not watching carefully enough.  It bothers me when people complain that certain questions have not been answered yet.  This is a show where I am sure that true PATIENCE will be rewarded.

As for the cast, the season 1 actors are still great.  Of all of them, Locke is the most 3-dimensional of the characters.  Charlie didn't have much to do this season, and Michael became a person to truly dislike, which I'm sure was intentional.  As for the ""tailies,"" everyone talks about how Michelle Rodriguez was a bad choice for Ana Lucia.  In this, I agree.  Her character was annoying, not particularly interesting, and not very well acted.  It is unfortunate that she marred the show, but she was important for moving along some plotlines and we did get to cheer a little bit when she died, at least.

And a quick hurrah for Henry Gayle!  The actor who played this ""Other"" did so with such finesse and terrifying energy.  As a bad guy (or a good guy?) he was fantastic.

Overall, a wonderful season full of mystery and intrigue.  I just hope that as the universe of this show gets bigger (the fake websites, the novels ""written"" by the author in the plane crash), that it doesn't collapse on itself.  Keep it up, Lost.  We're watching.",1150156800,7,2241,4.409756097560976
2569444,1,B000FIMG68,"The second year of Lost produced some of the worst storylines ever written. Instead of resolving many of the open issues of the first season, new characters and storylines were added. The additional characters or characters with greater roles were terrible. This whole plot line involving the chamber is getting more and more bizare and frankly boring.

The spacing of episodes was horrible. Never new when a new one was on. Weeks of repeats and worse yet repeats of last season. It killed the pacing of the show. I sometimes forgot what had occured because there were new episodes spaced weeks apart.

A show like Lost needs the same kind of showings like 24 (the best show on TV for many years now), the suspense, intensity and pace of the show keep viewers interested.

Reviewers who are giving this season 4 stars must have not been viewing the same show as I was. The viewership was down by close to 18% and understandably why. The show was terrible.

I'm hoping that once I view the show again on DVD my opinion might change.

Hoping season 3 is a lot better",1149984000,19,1064,4.578947368421052
2569445,5,B000FIMG68,"The first season of lost was the test run.  In the second season, the makers

seem to know exactly where they're headed, and give it the storyline a

definate arc.  Although I won't spoil anything for anybody, I will mention

that there are new characters, settings, and mysteries (of course!) abound.

The mystery of the island takes some interesting turns with the discovery

of what is actually IN the hatch, and the season's finale (perhaps the best

Lost episode to date) is absoloutely mind blowing. Also making his debut,

is Henry Gale, a mysterious island stranger who our Losties suspect of being

an other.  He brings to the story what it was lacking in the first season: a

VERY delicous bad guy.  His performance is award-worthy.  Finally, the

addition of a few other characters helps to balance some of the characters,

and give them more depth.  This season IS better than the first season

of lost, and for those of you who've seen it, you know that's quite an

accomplishment.",1149638400,11,994,4.741176470588235
2569446,4,B000FIMG68,"The show takes some unexpected turns this season. Like when thinking about where the show will go and what was in the hatch, who thought some strange guy named Desmond would be living in it already. I always read message boards where people say the show sucks, yet they are writing huge paragraphs about where the show will go next. Yet they are always wrong.

  In this season we meet Desmond who lives in the hatch pressing a button on a computer which to him is very important. When he leaves the hatch, Locke takes over pushing the button. Also after getting back to the island after their raft is destroyed by the Others, Michael, Sawyer and Jin are captured. They aren't taken by the Others though. They were found by other passengers that survived the crash but that crashed on the other side of the island. 4 new main characters are intoduced then. We see that Rose's hsuband Bernard is alive like she said. We meet a former female cop Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and the great Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as a priest named Mr. Eko. There's also Libby who may or may not be what she claims to be ""we'll probably never learn all the mysteries of her character with how things play out later in the season"".

  In one of the best episodes of the season, we get an episode about those passengers and how most of them were taken by the others. It's also well-done how one of them turns out to be an Other. That episode sorta may get some people to like Ana after she accidently shoots and kills Shannon in the episode before that. That episode with Shannon by the way shows that the writers aren't afraid to kill off characters in episodes that are about them.

  Also shortly after Michael comes back to his side of the island, he steals some guns from the hatch and sets out to rescue his son Walt from the Others. Jack, Kate ""who's not supposed to be there"", Locke and Sawyer go after him only to find the Others who warn them never to go to that part of the island again. Also Danielle ""the French chick"", captures who she claims is an other and hands him over to Sayid. Sayid questions him and says he knows he's an other but Jack won't listen. The man claims to be Henri Gail who got there on an air balloon and that he buried his wife's body there. We also get a clever episode about Hurley where we see him in the nuthouse and he finds out that his bestfriend isn't real. When back on the island Libby gets him to hold back on his appretite. Then he starts seeing his imaginary friend again who he thought he got rid of. He tells Hurley that the island isn't real and that Hurley is really in a coma. He says that if he wants to get back to reality he needs to jump off a cliff. It's up to Libby to try to talk sense into Hurley. In the end of that episode we learn that Libby too was in the nuthouse with Hurley.

  Anyway there's tons of other smart moments in this season but I don't want to give too much away. This season may have lost some viewers since it's mostly about mind games between the others and the passengers. It's also about whether or not Locke or anyone else for that matter should even bother pushing the button in the hatch. It's a brainy season that takes your full attention even more than the first season. I think it's only problem is killing off main characters and choosing them all to be women.

  In the preview for this season they say ""they aren't the survivors they thought they were. So we expected some people to die. All the killing to me though seems meaningless. Shannon probably just died because they couldn't think of where to go with her character. While with Libby, they had good ideas for her but never give us her full background after making us interested in her with the Hurley episode. Also when we get the second Ana episode, I thought ""whether people like her or not she's gonna be here for awhile"". Then in the same episode...bam!, she's dead. It was shocking tv but it also bugged me since she was growing on me. So in next season they need to give the killing a rest. I also personally hope that Desmond isn't dead and becomes a regular, since he's the best new character next to Mr. Eko.

  Plus they give us so many mysteries of the island this season, that it makes me feel like season 3 will be the last. They need more than just passengers stuck on an island with mysterious other people. I'd like to learn that the Others really aren't the big bad of the island and that there's something else worse than them there. Otherwise it's going to be hard to squeeze out more seasons. People are already getting bored with the others, so the show needs more than them. Since this is one of the best shows on tv I'd hate to see it fail due to losing viewers.",1148688000,12,4722,4.3284258210645525
2569447,5,B000FIMG68,"There is no other show on television now that has been as consistently good as the show LOST. Of course, that's just my opinion, but I just feel that with each and every episode the writing, the acting, and the whole production value of each and every episode keeps getting better and better and better.

This season was a little bit darker than last season. In fact, my wife almost threatened to stop watching it...promises, promises...but darkness doesn't necessarily mean negative. Darkness is the womb of transistion. Darkness is what we usually all have to go through in order to find some glimpse of Light...some hope...some redemption...and it is that small glimmer of brightness that we as human beings cling to. But as Henry David Thoreau once remarked, ""Most of us are living lives of quiet desperation...""

Desperation sets in when we forget about those shreds of inspiration that are contained in each and every situation we are in. I think that's what we're going to see in the next season. I think we're going to find the characters having more faith, more resolve, more personal determination to go forward but that doesn't mean the show itself will turn into a sunny picnic because life isn't like that.

I felt the new characters particularly Mr. Eko, Anna Lucia, Libby, and Henry Gale brought the show to a new level of excitement. I'll be honest with you, I cried when Hurley found out that Libby had been shot. Oh, did I spoil it for anyone? Mmmm...I'm sorry...maybe you should've been watching!

2569455,5,B000FIMG68,"I eagerly awaited the second season of ""Lost"" last fall and I am eagerly awaiting the second season to be released on DVD. After reading the mostly favorable reviews (the one star review has me wondering if we saw the same show), I'm of the opinion that the believed ""slump"" is due to viewers thinking the characters and story lines would fall in place with our own logical conclusions. If we have learned anything about this show, it's that there are no guarantees.

For example, I used to think Sawyer was deep down a good guy behind a bad guy exterior. My opinion changed with the tree frog incident as well as the scheme for the guns. Same goes for Charlie with his ""visions"" and crazy behavior. Also, who'd have ever thought that innocent and demure Sun might possibly have a checkered past or that Ana Lucia actually has a heart?

All my initial impressions of the characters and plot were completely turned around and left me with a feeling of uncertainty. There may have been a sense of betrayal felt by the many fans of this show as a result. At times that uncertainty was hard to swallow, but that uncertainty is what makes ""Lost"" such great television and what keeps me glued to me T.V. every Wednesday night.

We must all remember that everything that has transpired so far is for a reason (that's what we're meant to believe, anyway). I will gladly watch this DVD in anticipation of those reasons coming up in season 3. I'm guessing someday we'll all remember season two as not only well written and brilliantly acted, but as the most inportant.",1147824000,3,1558,4.577060931899641

No other show that I can think of has sparked as much interest, debate and excitement, and with the perfect blend of action, mystery, suspense, romance, and yes even comedy at times, LOST has something for everyone.

2569457,5,B000FIMG68,"I avoided watching ""Lost"" weekly, in part because of the pan and scan, in part the commercials, and in part because it did not run week to week for large parts of the year. More than any other television drama I have ever seen, it is meant to be seen in marathon chunks as a very long film. So this issue is very welcome.

In a drama with such a large arc, the second act (in this case taking a year) is the toughest to get right. It can't be as surprising as the first without violating the story, and we know enough now to catch any mistakes. They have pulled it off. The acting, cinematography, writing are all as good as the story unfolds. I expected more of a dropoff.

Two questions I continue to ask: where is the monster? And why is there no gay character or couple in a cast that is nearly a hundred? It is not an odd observation, it is as odd as if there were no black, Asian or Hispanic character, or no one over the age of 35. Perhaps it is a plot point to be revealed in the future, though that seems unlikely. In a work as brilliant as ""Lost"" it is a strange omission.

As with season one, the most brilliant sequences are the flashbacks.

It would be wonderful of the casting in ""Lost"" - of talents not names - became hugely influental, but I've been punching that particular number into the culture every hour or so for years with no effect.",1147737600,,1357,4.1679389312977095

I know this is goin to be part of my collection 100% eventhough I never buy DVD sets let alone of TV series...apart from the Sopranos...but thats's another story!!So don't listen to the loonies be your own judge!!Cheers!",1147737600,,610,4.657407407407407

8123427,5,B000FIMG68,"I envy anyone who watches LOST for the first time. Simply put, it's probably the most supsensful psychological thriller/mystery ever created for television.

The series debuted in September of 2004 (14 years ago from the time of this review). In my opinion, nothing else on TV has EVER come close to the quality and complexity of this series.

The first three seasons are of such a high quality that part of your enjoyment will come from sheer bewilderment that such amazing storytelling is even possible. The quality of writing, acting, and directing is unsurpassed. Honestly, you'll find yourself in utter amazement or disbelief at the end of many episodes.

Everywhere you look on TV today you'll find aspects being borrowed from the LOST playbook. Whether it was the twist endings or connected subplots found in some episodes of Breaking Bad, or the mystery and elements of isolation in The 100 or the first two seasons of The Arrow. You can trace it all back to LOST.

Also, a TV series having an online presence is common today, but the extent of LOST's foreay into cyberspace at the time was unheard of. Online forums were filled with THOUSANDS of theories concerning LOST's plotline. The producers even set up websites designed to compliment certain fictitious plot elements. There had never been a more dedicated or consistently active group of online fans.

This is an amazing season. Enjoy the ride, there's never been anything else like it!",1524960000,,1452,4.934426229508197
8123428,5,B000FIMG68,"I used to watch Lost all the time when I was in Middle School. Very good, action packed show that keeps you guessing what will happen next. Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.

So they used to have it on Netflix. My boyfriend and I binge watched season one. When they took it off, I was thrilled to find the rest of the seasons here for such a great price, no less.

Season two came in amazing condition and weve had no problems with any of the discs since.",1523145600,,468,4.076086956521739

8123430,3,B000FIMG68,"Lost, Season #2, Nothing in the Disc #7.
I purchased the Season #2, used  like new with Amazon. The DVD 7 has nothing; always shows the same image on the TV screen, It was not possible to forward or return. Where is the QA/QC of the used products?",1521244800,,247,4.145833333333333
8123431,5,B000FIMG68,"Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands, The New People, and Peter Benchleys Amazon are examples of survivor type shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo, Libby, Lucia and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty. I think the church represented Purgatory.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1521158400,,2276,5.349162011173185
