8168150,5,B000MEYJLA,"If you love ninjas, and you enjoy laughter, then you should own this DVD.  It is so funny, you may very well laugh to DEATH.  It's got the first 30 episodes of the askaninja podcast, as well as the first ten ""special feature"" podcasts.  Unless you have a thing for watching episodic content on DVD rather than as a podcast, though, that's all freely available content.  But the DVD also contains a generous dollop of DVD-exclusive content that's well worth the price... including ""crossover"" videos starring the youtube-famed Urban Ninja!

Also, you can easily order it from the askaninja.com store, directly from the source.",1189468800,,625,4.971153846153846

I wish this guy would come to comic con or something.  One of the funniest things I have seen this year.",1187308800,,239,3.6470588235294117
