8158174,5,B000KLPR02,"I grew up in New York State, and rumors circulated about summer camp programs for refugees, especially Jews, who survived the Holocaust of WWII and struggles in the aftermath.  Migrants were coming to America for decades to survive.  Rosenberg's production of ""Zelimo"" provides an excellent insight to the realities as recovery from War took its toll on civilians as well as military.  Zelimo's family were farmers.  During a desperate struggle to emigrate to freedom in the USA, his Father and Brother were killed.  While Zelimo and his Mother survived and have a Summer in Catskills, the flashbacks and memories of Zelimo's family tragedies haunt him.  In a new land, Zelimo has no compass adrift in a America.  But he learned to stand up for himself and his own path in life.  In a new context of existence Zelimo learns acceptance in a new circle of people.  The only criticism I have of this DVD is the lack of English captions that enable the viewer to learn names and places not common in America.  Nevertheless, the best story of this Jewish struggle is told by Jewish Actors and Jewish producers themselves.  Well done!  Five stars!",1501459200,,1141,4.824742268041237

8158176,4,B000KLPR02,"Heartwarming and intense, Zelimo provides an unflinching look into the soul of a boy who is haunted by a darkness from his past even as he is thrust into the uncertain future of a new life in a new world. First-time director/writer Aleks Rosenberg handles the telling of this tale with masterful production and lyrical editing of a kind practiced by seasoned film-makers.",1178928000,3,371,4.904761904761905
8158177,4,B000KLPR02,"This film is about a young Russian boy's comming of age. His first experience in the former Soviet Union was discrimination, because he was a Jew. While escaping through the border his father is killed. Zelimo, the

young boy feels responsible for his father's death.

Arriving to America in the 1950s the McCarthy idialogy is rampant. While in a Jewish summer camp in the Catskills he is ridiculed and humiliated for his presumed communist background by a camp bully and his gang. He becomes a loner and plans to burn down a bungalow where the camp bully and his gang is sleeping. The revange is successful.

The movie asks questions about the responsibility for the aggression

and wether or not it could have been stopped before its execution.

In view of the recent shooting violance at Virginia Tech and the previous disaster at Columbine HS,this movie should be a must showing at every high school and perhaps in colleges as well. The film is an excellent motivator of discussions for identifying and preventing similar violance in the future.",1175385600,14,1049,4.870786516853933
8158178,4,B000KLPR02,"This is a poignant coming of age story, beautifully photographed in Russia and upstate New York.  It's obviously low budget, so there's no star power here, but this sweet, underrated film will grab you.",1174867200,5,202,4.9411764705882355
8158179,4,B000KLPR02,"ZELIMO is an atypical memory film that captures in modest, sensitive strokes a personal view of growing up Russian Jewish in New York around the time of the Cuban Missle Crisis.  The acting ensemble is uneven, but the genuine emotional force comes through with distinction.  For a first feature film, Rosenberg launches his narrative with clear conviction and fairness to the period.  Renowned boyhood films such as 400 BLOWS and MY LIFE AS A DOG become more important as years pass and these film films take on legendary status in cinema.  ZELIMO, although not in this privileged league, will grow in significance as more discerning viewers discover it.",1174694400,6,654,5.027777777777778
