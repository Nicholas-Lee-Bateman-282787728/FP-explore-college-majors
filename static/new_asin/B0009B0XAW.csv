There's not enough practice, reviewing or anything like that. It's the type of thing where you're highly unlikely to actually remember anything they taught you once you actually go to Germany and use it. And isn't that the whole point of using the product?",1379376000,,380,4.7727272727272725
8058963,4,B0009B0XAW,"Although the translations are not exact, the basic meanings of the phrases are accurate and this is a nice starter for infrequent travelers to German speaking countries.",1367452800,,169,5.296296296296297
8058964,5,B0009B0XAW,I bought this as a birthday gift for someone traveling overseas. They love this gift. I actually watched it with them and its pretty good. You'll have to practice though. So expect to spend some time on this but a lot less then say using audio recordings.,1275264000,2,255,4.446808510638298
8058965,2,B0009B0XAW,"This DVD is so boring that I am not motivated to watch it at all.  I thought it would be scenes of people using phrases in real life situations.  Instead, it is 2 actors, 1 male and 1 female.  You see a phrase in print, and you see the actors stand there and say it, and that's it.  The actors are in a studio, and the backdrop doesn't change.

The actors also don't look like they were even expecting to be on camera that day - the female in particular has very messy hair, no makeup, etc. It doesn't look like a lot of effort went into the production - more like it was done as cheaply as possible.

Also, it is supposed to be in a format of see the word, hear the word, say the word, but it is slow-paced and you can easily repeat the word several times before getting to the part where you're supposed to repeat it.  By that time, you're ready to move on.

I found this DVD slow-paced, dull, and not at all engaging.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  I have had better luck with interactive computer software.  Too bad there aren't any good DVDs for German out there that I can find.",1184112000,13,1091,4.099056603773585
