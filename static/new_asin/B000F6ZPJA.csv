8118453,3,B000F6ZPJA,"This workout is 21 minutes including the warm-up (4 min), main workout (13) & floor work (4 min) because the intro itself was almost 4 minutes. Shpresa Perlleshi leads & talks while two other women serve as the beginner & intermediate levels. The stage is professional, but almost darkly lit for an exercise dvd, the music being a beat & sound effects like 90s remixed song music.
The warm-up, main & floor have some of the same movements & poses like dancer's pose in yoga (she calls airplane).
The main idea is holding poses to strengthen muscles, though she does add some reps, but isometrics is the main idea. The warm-up & main involve a lot of squats, lifting of the leg in various directions in each different pose, lunges with pushing palms together, holding a ""time out"" T with the hands pose (why?), or bringing the shoulders together to work the, usually weak on most people, rhomboids.
The floor work has pilates, such as laying on your back & scissoring your legs, legs up w/crunches & yoga plank, cobra, pigeon pose, etc.
As another reviewer said, she does spend a lot of time with the woman doing the beginner level reminding her where to stop, possibly the woman was brought on late.  Shpresa is ok, seems earnest which helps, it wasn't until things felt repetitive that I gave up & the constant swing arms up as you breathe between leg building exercises got to me. I have taken classes in short yang style tai chi & did not see anything of it here.
This could have been so much better if there was more exercises for other body parts, not just mostly legs & less repetition.",1288396800,3,1592,4.547038327526132
8118454,4,B000F6ZPJA,"I have Shpresa's two other dvds and have found they work. I am sore after I use them. Shpresa is a good instructor. Not annoying at all. The best way I can describe this dvd is a meditation with a workout at the same time. Overall, it is a decent workout dvd for those days where you need to take it easy/relax but still get a decent workout.",1223424000,3,342,4.044117647058823
8118455,5,B000F6ZPJA,"Okay, I am not a fitness expert, but I just did this workout for the first time.  I am familiar with Pilates.  I have found some fantastic pilates videos and then some that are terrible.  I have been hesitant about yoga, and I know nothing about Tai Chi.  When I started this workout, I really thought it would be fairly easy.  I have become rather intermediate in my workouts and I need a lot to get my heart rate up.  I'm starting to sell of my workout videos that don't work me out well enough.

This video really worked me out.  Very rarely have I found a video that I just fall to the floor and say ""it hurts too much I can't do it!""  I told my daughter to leave the room so I could concentrate!  I had no problem with the beginner being corrected.  Many workout videos do that.  I feel that she challenged me, and I plan to buy this DVD soon.  It is at least going on my wish list.

As to the results, I don't know.  Maybe I won't burn loads of fat like is claimed on the video.  But this video can't hurt.  Something was going on.  I could feel it in my muscles!",1213056000,3,1069,4.0095238095238095
8118456,1,B000F6ZPJA,"I am a fitness professional who has taught many classes for 10+ years and I have to say this is the single worst and most pointless routine I have ever encountered!  The women are ridiculous looking, acting, and more importantly the routine is a waste of 30 min.  Save your time and money!  I really hate to give a bad review of anything but this was that bad!",1160784000,7,360,4.264705882352941
