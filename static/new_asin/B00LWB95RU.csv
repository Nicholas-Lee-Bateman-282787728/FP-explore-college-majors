6508475,4,B00LWB95RU,"Mary of Nazareth starts off in a startling fashion. A band of marauders with a group of dogs is going through a small town and capturing all the young girls. Anna and Joachim hear them coming and manage to hide Mary from the men. The dogs, however, are sniffing around and miraculously are unable to find Mary. This is the first hint of one of the underlying themes in the movie - Mary is special. What about the captured girls? They are lined up and inspected by a woman, Herod's wife. She is looking for the one who is to give birth to the Messiah, and wants to kill her. This and other scenes, like Mary taken to the Temple to live were inspired by the writings of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich. It therefore became clear early on that this movie will be a mixture of Scripture, tradition, and creative license.

Fast forward about a decade, maybe two, and we see Mary back home with her parents. Joseph has come to ask Mary to be his wife. They could have went with one of two traditions regarding Joseph. They could have made him an older widower with children from his first wife (my preference). Or they could have went with Joseph who was slightly older than Mary, never married, and remained a virgin his whole life like Mary. They chose the latter. In the first scenes with Joseph, we see him seek the permission of Joachim to talk to Mary and Joachim blows him off. Anna, however, says to go and talk to Mary. This seems out of place given that time, but it made for a ""cute scene.""  I'm not entirely sure how I felt about the interaction between Mary and Joseph. It was a bit flirty, and just felt like they reduced it to some superficial love story.

The movie continues on with scenes we are familiar with from the Bible. There is the Annunciation, Mary's visit to Elizabeth, etc. The director takes creative license with the story and embellishes the facts, like Joseph getting FURIOUS with Mary for her pregnancy, and Joseph giving up on Mary for what seems like a long time. It was puzzling to me why Mary's parents refused to believe that Elizabeth was pregnant in her old age or the manner in which Mary became pregnant with Jesus. For starters, Anne and Joachim were supposed to be barren as well, so why should it be puzzling that Elizabeth became pregnant. Secondly, her parents said early on in the movie that Mary was special, so why change that all of a sudden? It doesn't fit with the storyline. I'm sure Mary felt some level of ostracization, as was portrayed in the movie, but she shouldn't have felt judged by her parents.

There are parts of this movie that seemed forced and reaching for an emotional moment, and there are parts that leave you raw after viewing them. The scene of the slaying of the Holy Innocents ripped my heart out, and it caused me to really stop and think about those poor mothers and fathers back then whose children died at the hands of Herod. The rest of the movie is a mixture of Bible, tradition, and creative license. We see Jesus as a child get hurt and bleed, which was nice as it's foolish to think that Jesus never got hurt or bled. We see Jesus as an adult performing miracles, preaching, and ultimately dying on the Cross. The final scene of the movie has Mary telling the Apostles about how Jesus disappeared in the Temple for three days, and how she didn't understand at the time, but did now. Mary Magdalene then comes in to tell them that Jesus is risen, and the Apostles run off to see. The move then ends with one last scene of Mary and Jesus, Mother and Son.

As I expected beforehand, I have very mixed feelings regarding this movie. There were times I wanted to scream at the screen, and say, ""That's not accurate!"" or, ""Joseph would have never acted like that!"" There were other times I was in awe of how the scene captured the human experiences Mary endured while on this Earth. I waffled between giving this movie a 3.5 or a 4 and ultimately decided on a 4 for one very important reason - the message of this movie. That message is that Mary, greatest Saint ever, wants none of the attention on her and wants it all on her Son. She is there to lead us to Jesus, not the other way around.",1415750400,38,4166,4.3981841763942935
6508476,5,B00LWB95RU,"(WARNING: Spoilers follow in this review. You have been warned . . .)

Of all the roles an actor or actress might consider playing, few, I would think, are as thankless as Jesus Christ and his mother, Mary. How, exactly, does an actor bring life to a character who is perfect and sinless without coming across as flat and lifeless or, to swing the pendulum to the other extreme, so dramatic that the character no longer seems real? I must admit, I was skeptical when I first heard about this film. I have seen so many portrayals of the Blessed Mother in various films and television productions throughout the years, none of which had come remotely close to portraying the unwavering devotion this incredible woman maintained to her God and her Lord.

Having seen this film, however, I am happy to state that Alissa Jung has accomplished the seemingly impossible. Her Mary is a woman defined by her total acquiescence to God's will, characterized by her humility and her quiet strength. At first glance, this approach may come across as simple, making Mary appear naive and far too innocent, but the reality is far from that. Rather, Jung's performance shows the Blessed Mother for the humble servant she is: ever trusting in her Son's mission, yet, simultaneously, wanting nothing more than to suffer in his stead. When Jung begins to recite the Magnificat, the joy in her face is indescribable, drawing the viewer in just as Mary draws Zecharias and his brothers to her in amazement. Her acting alone more than makes up for any of this film's few deficiencies.

But no film can be carried by one actor or actress alone. Luca Marinelli gives a moving performance as Joseph, portrayed in this film as a young man eager to begin a life with his new bride, only to be devastated when Mary returns from her visit to Elizabeth visibly pregnant by--seemingly--another man. Mary's explanation is too much for him to bear, until he too is addressed by Gabriel and becomes a willing servant of his Lord. (Incidentally, the dogma of the Blessed Mother's perpetual virginity is hinted at by Joseph's question to Mary on their wedding night: ""Will they ever be able to understand a family like ours?"") Paz Vega gives a convincing performance as Mary Magdalene--portrayed in this film according to tradition as the woman caught in adultery documented in St. John's Gospel--although much of her backstory was edited out of this cut of the film from the original 4 hour cut. (In the longer cut of the film, Mary and Magdalene are portrayed as childhood acquaintances, with the film documenting the radically different paths their lives took, with Mary Magdalene becoming a member of Herod's harem, only to be cast out and subsequently driven to prostitution.) And Andreas Pietcschmann provides an understated, dignified portrayal of Christ whose performance shines in his scenes with his Mother; the relationship between the two is unambiguously shown as a deep, abiding love far beyond any other mother/son relationship in history. The miracle of water turning to wine at the wedding at Cana is perhaps the best summation of Jung and Pietcshmann's chemistry: Mary asks her Son to work a miracle and, as the viewer watches their eyes connect, he agrees to accede to his Mother's request. Likewise, when Christ is scourged, Mary shares in his physical agony as well; the quick cuts from Jesus's to Mary's reactions to this torment underscores the depths of their connection.

So much of this film rests upon the many juxtapositions conjured by the screenplay. For instance, when Christ delivers the salt and light discourse, he and his apostles are seated in Mary's house as she kneads dough for bread, adding salt to the dough in time with her Son's words. Similarly, when Mary Magdalene falls into Mary's arms as Jesus preaches in the background, completely broken from her suffering, ready to fall into Christ's service, Christ is delivering the parable of the prodigal son. The editing perfectly captures so much of these important moments, with the cuts flowing naturally, rarely drawing attention to themselves. Director Giamcomo Campiotti has crafted his film with a visual ethos like so many holy cards and religious icons, but in the best possible way. The Annunciation, for example, is beautifully lit, with Mary--clothed all in white--bathed in radiant light, the figure of the archangel Gabriel barely visible through the magnificent luminescence, giving the scene an ethereal beauty that transcends the humble and sparse house in which this linchpin of a scene transpires. Admittedly, the casting and costumes are not truly authentic to the period, but in a story such as this, what matters most is conveying the inherent beauty of the greatest mystery in human history.

This film is not perfect, of course. Some of the extras at time seem uncertain of what they should be doing, and some of the actors--Zacharias and Joseph of Arimathea especially--clearly have been dubbed, having read their lines in Italian. The character of Herodias, a composite character intended to serve as an antagonist, lacks depth and motivation; indeed, her motivations are never fleshed out. The viewer is left to infer that she serves as a feminine guise for Satan, spurring Herod to order the massacre of the Holy Innocents and tempting Christ during his fasting in the desert, but the character is never allowed to grow beyond the stereotypes of the ""big bad."" And, most unfortunately, many scenes play out without context, leaving one who may be unfamiliar with the Gospels grasping to determine just what the point of a given scene is. For example, we see John the Baptist baptizing in the desert, but we never see him baptize Christ (which the viewer naturally expects to see as a consequence of the film's apparent foreshadowing). He is then arrested and imprisoned by Herod and disappears from the narrative completely, leaving the viewer wondering just what was left on the cutting room floor.

Jung's performance alone, however, is enough to atone for these deficiencies, leaving an incredible impression upon the viewer as a woman defined by her fiat. The supplements on the second disc are quite nice, especially the interview with Jung in which she describes--in a dignified, respectful manner--the incredible responsibility she felt upon accepting the role and how she worked to deliver a performance worthy of said responsibility. In this reviewer's mind, Jung and her associates have more than succeeded. While the film is being marketed primarily to Catholics, any Christian or nonbeliever should, at the very least, be moved by this tribute to the greatest woman in history and her unchanging response to her God and Lord whenever called upon: ""Here I am.""",1414540800,24,6753,5.0142602495543676

It is a beautiful film to show those who have issues with the Mother of God. It was different than what I was expecting but what they did have in the movie touched me deeply. I am not going to say much because I want you to watch however when they were showing the agony in the garden, scourging at the pillar and nailing at the cross, it showed Mary really well as  Co-Redemptrix and how she gave her life to suffer a long with her Son. She suffered with our Lord and was pierced with a sword in her Heart. There was a part in the movie where she said, not in the same words, let me suffer instead of Him. It is just beautiful.  I also really loved how they connected the beginning with the end. They did really well with that. It is a MUST SEE!",1414454400,18,856,4.0

I had to buy a second copy to let others see this film, because I didn't want to let go of it.  This is the most beautiful version of Mary that I've ever seen.
I also really liked the second tape interviewing the leading characters, it added the perfect touch, especially with Father Calloway, I've heard him speak at 3 of our Divine Mercy conferences, (who is all about Mary), and he couldn't find any flaws on how they described Mary and the film itself.

There is really nothing more important than theological accuracy in these types of films and this one misses the mark big time.

If you are knowledgeable in Sacred Scripture this REPRESENTATION will disgust you.
For example- the wedding feast at cana portrays the Blessed Virgin as negotiating with Her Divine Son. REALLY?!?! Then there is the annunciation scene which has all of its theological import evicerated by the text being twisted into a meaning totally apart from the meaning in scripture.
The screen writers ignored the biblical meanings and obviously ignored Sacred tradtion when they created this trash.

6508581,2,B00LWB95RU,"May 10th, 2015:  I had heard and read so much about this film and was eager to watch it.  I was terribly disappointed.  The acting is shallow, no depth, no conviction. Mary's large dimples make it seem as if she is laughing all the time.  Mary Magdalen was made to seem a fool. Great liberties were taken with Scripture. One instance is Magdalen searching for Jesus near His tomb; she sees Him and runs to Him and embraces Him.  He calls her name afterwards -in reality, she did not know Him until He speaks her name and when she draws near, in reality, He tells her not to cling to Him, etc.  None of the characters was well portrayed.  I understand than no film can ever come close to portraying the Mother of God but this  portrayal was particularly shallow and non-Scriptural. If anyone wants to read a beautiful portrayal of Mary, get the book: ""A Woman Wrapped in Silence""...it will capture your heart and bring you into the rhythm of Mary's life.",1431216000,,953,4.468208092485549

6508586,4,B00LWB95RU,"Excellent telling of Mary's life before, during and after the Resurrection of Jesus.  The made up tale of Herodias, as a devil in disguise, searching for Mary as a child to destroy her was a little far out but made for some fine drama.  There's a few mistakes also by the production concerning certain wording such as instead of the word Passover used in Judea during the time of Jesus, Pilate refers to it as ""your Easter"" as he's about to offer the mob either Jesus or Barabbas.  Other than a few discrepancies, the movie is excellent especially the acting of Alissa Jung in the role of Mary.  She made me believe that this is how the blessed Mother would look like and how her personality would be...kind and very loving as Our Lord's mother.  The movie basically follows the gospels and I won't go into details about certain scenes so as not to spoil the movie for others.

I don't understand how so many mistakes can be made.  My husband, son and I watched it as a family and HAD TO STOP with the scene with Herod.  My biggest exclamation of ""Oh NO! Are they Kidding?"" was over St. Joseph having a complete fit of anger and smashing the house he was building over Our Lady's pregnancy - EVEN IF you had NO TRADITION, how does the Scripture concerning Joseph - ""....a Just and Upright man (not out of control) wanted to divorce her Quietly....""

This RICH version I speak of, that we ALL LOVE was originally seen for us, by US audiences on Netflix.

THIS piece of crap, however, is the result of CENSORSHIP buy Ignatius press - the Catholic-American branch who is responsible for distribution of the film on American soil.

6508619,1,B00LWB95RU,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Mary.  I LOVE Ignatius press and most of the movies I've seen by them.  This movie though was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, not to mention being one of the longest.  The score was terrible, the stories jump around out of order of the scriptures, and gets basic parts wrong.  I mean when Pilate said, ""once a year on your EASTER festival.."" Come on?!  Really?!  It's Passover!  Then there is the random spots where non-English speaking actors have voice overs and the one time an English speaking actor was dubbed.  Another odd part was when Jesus quoted Ps 22:1 while he was on the cross and it wasn't the actor's voice!

Then there was Mary's reaction to the angel.  She was completely calm? Yeah right! Angels=big trouble in the OT and that is why the angel (who looks like an elf from LOTR)  says ""fear not"".

I'm sorry that this is so random and has such little detail but I saw this movie in theaters when it came out so I've forgotten some. To sum it all up, the only thing that stood out to me about the movie was how awful it was.  I have never seen a professionally done movie edited so poorly and have such atrocious post-production or writing or acting.

6508629,2,B00LWB95RU,"I know I am in the minority with respect to other reviews, but the film is quite bad, artistically speaking.  The acting is terrible.  I have seen school productions with better acting and range of emotions than the actors displayed in this film.  The delivery of lines came across as someone reading the lines for the first time.  At no point did the characters draw me into the drama of the story.  (I refer to ""characters"" and ""story"" not to deny the historicity of the life of Jesus and Mary, but to refer to the artistic value and merit of this particular production.)  It simply never ""grabbed"" me.  I never felt compassion or empathy for the characters.  They never seemed real, but were more akin to moving and talking ""statues.""  The script was not compelling either.

I have always been impressed with Ignatius Press, which is why I am so disappointed with this.  It seemed to me that those responsible for this film were more concerned with presenting Mariological insights that it sacrificed quality performances and a gripping script with authentic characters that would invite us into the story itself.  To simply put on film these Mariological insights does not replace the need for characters with more depth than a potato chip.  It may be good theology, but it was bad acting and bad writing.

I had the impression too the makers of this film wanted to capture some of the unique and moving insights of Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ.""  I do not want to give any ""spoilers"" but several scenes had the feeling it was attempting to duplicate those moments with a slight twist but in this case the imitation fell flat on its face.

After watching the film with a group of my Catholic friends, I apologized because of how bad it was.  I gave the DVD away immediately because I will never watch it again.

Then I watched the movie. NOT just the nativity story. Powerful. Emotional. It sort of ties together all those Mary movies you have seen in the past into one film. It's similar in style to the other saints films from Ignatius too. So if you liked Restless Heart, Maria Goretti, Francis & Clareyou'll like this one too.

There are some liberties done of course in adding material in order to give a better biography. But nothing glaring. I think this is also a good film on motherhood and families.

6508645,5,B00LWB95RU,"Mary of Nazareth is a film about the Mary,the mother of Christ. It provides us her life from her childhood to the resurrection of Jesus based on the four gospels. Alissa Jung stars in the title role.

Alissa Jung was special in her portrayal as Mary. One will definitely empathize with her character. We get to see a special person who has shown what the Mother of God would be like in real life. She was extremely happy when the angel of the Lord appeared to her and gave her the mission of becoming the mother of Jesus despite the fact that she was unaware of the probable consequences that it would present like death with respect to the law of Moses and the fact that he was to be abandoned by Joseph. While growing up,she formed a very strong bond with her son that one parents would definitely envy as there was closeness between them that could probably be characterized as an unbreakable bond. Also,she was a strong and compassionate presence when her son Jesus began his public ministry. She shares with her son's both joyful and painful experience. Finally,the viewer will definitely feel in her pain particularly during the passion and death of Jesus.

This is one film that is both inspiring and entertaining. It will definitely give us an appreciation of who Mary is and what she is all about. Also,her role in Jesus' life was definitely given such great importance that any Christian regardless of denomination will definitely appreciate. A masterpiece indeed!!!",1419465600,,1476,4.76171875

6508668,4,B00LWB95RU,"A very moving picture which shows a believable Mary and Joseph.  Some aspects (angelic communications) were overly smaltzy, but all in all a very good movie for young people who see Mary as someone with a crown who spend most of her time just praying or gazing heaven ward...  Both acting and photography work are great.",1417392000,2,320,4.696428571428571

6508672,5,B00LWB95RU,"My wife and I just finished watching Mary of Nazareth. The portrayals of Mary and Joseph are excellent. Their relationship comes alive. Much is expressed without their saying anything.
Mary is full of joy and love. We believe that part of the reason for this is that Alissa Jung who portrays Mary worked with poor children in Haiti.",1416960000,,332,4.741379310344827

6508674,5,B00LWB95RU,"Inspiring with wonderful direction and acting. The journey of Mary, Jesus and Joseph covers certain events that actually
took place and a few events that may or may not have actually happened. Nor does it include everything in the history
of their lives; however incompleteness does not a discredit or does it reduce the spiritual value of what may have actually
taken place. It is the humanness of the story wedded with the the spirituality that coveys the message to the heart.",1416787200,,479,4.853658536585366

Whether you are a believer or not, this movie will capture your attention especially at this time of the year; ""Christmas"".  We need to refocus on the story of the nativity and not how much money we have to spend this Christmas.  Thank you for a wonderful film. Rachel",1416182400,,431,4.3625

6508684,5,B00LWB95RU,"Surprised not more reviews as this is a wonderful movie and every Christian should see it.  It brings the truth of Mary to the screen as much as is possible in a movie.  We have watched it over and over many times and always are uplifted by the movie.
I try to read and watch as much as possible, stories like this to imprint on my brain the truth of the gospel.  After all the world imprints on us the anti-gospel every minute of every day.  We don't watch any TV any more, as it is absolutely straight from satan in my opinion.  It is funny when I hear of so and so actor or actress has done some bad act; I have usually never heard of them.",1416096000,,643,3.9921875

I located this movie  to purchase this wonderful movie.  but unfortunately , it was not the same  as the streaming edition. This edition was cut!!!  This is the story of Mary, primarily and her relationship to her son as well as her friend, Mary Madeline. At the beginning of the streamed filmed, the relationship between the two Mary's was established, fictional or not, it was quite an interesting story line.  That was eliminated from this edition.  Truly a shame.",1416009600,2,570,4.793814432989691
6508686,5,B00LWB95RU,"Great movie.  This presents the Holy Family as a joyful, down-to-earth unit, sociable with a sense of humor, and Christ as a real man.  I found it a welcome contrast to the sometimes unsmiling and overly-ethereal characters presented in movies.  The creative license necessary to produce such a movie was used wisely.",1416009600,,317,5.0576923076923075
