7937007,3,B00005B7AD,I bought this movie because I LOVED it as a pre-teen and would sneak up late just to watch it on HBO. When I watched it the other day I had to laugh because it is completely horrible. lol  Terrible acting and cheesy music. Hilarious!,1323388800,,233,4.177777777777778
7937008,4,B00005B7AD,"Some films I just love to watch over again. I don't always know why. Here, it's the fantastic music by Francis Lai (Love Story) the charisma of Natasha Kinski, and exceptional photography during the romantic interludes between Debbie and her boyfriend at the boy's school across the bridge. We can subtract a star for dubbing and some silly scenes. But I would rather watch a dubbed film than one subtitled with words the actors might never had said, or lines rewritten with each new release on video. It's really funny, too, where a party is given for the old parents and sponsors and Debbie slips aphrodesiac pills into the punch.",1272412800,,632,4.754545454545455
7937009,3,B00005B7AD,"I love how the VHS review has this at 5 stars, and the DVD at 1 star. I'll be happy to provide the voice in the middle. NOTE: This is a 3-5 star only if you don't pay much for it.
I found a DVD of this in my local Walgreen's bargain bin, and was quite delighted. A film ""set"" in the '50s (but so full of anachronisms, it makes the mind reel...I'm guessing there was no continuity checker on board), starring a very young Nastassja Kinski as the ""rebel"" american girl who goes to boarding school overseas, teaching the horny-but-virginal nymphets in her dorm about the ways of amore-for-money. Sorta. They set up this idea for a brothel with the local boys academy, but almost nobody gets what they want...screwups and slapstick abound. Jokes are flat, characters even more so, and the bad dubbing and dialogue make it sound like this was translated from Swedish to Hungarian, into Mandarin, maybe a quick detour into classical Latin, and then into English.
As the movie ends, there's a brief, vaguely funny, vaguely alluring series of stripteases by the girls (some sexy, some comedic...is it just me, or do some of these girls not look nearly old enough to be doing these kinds of things on film?), we get the payoff...Kinski and her suitor (who, owing to his long name, is known by the acronym F.I.B.S. throughout the film!) have a ""loving and romantic"" dalliance in the boudoir. Those of you wishing to grab an eyeful of Ms. Kinski in all her glory should make sure to have your frame-by-frame pause revved and ready here.
Skin content in this alleged ""sex comedy"" is paltry, apart from a hilarious closeup of a breast during the opening credits, and a few bizarre dialogue scenes in the communal shower (the girls are discussing their plans while hugging each other, laughing, toweling off, AND standing under the shower nozzles, all at once!). More cloying by a factor of nine than your average ""hot dog"" movie of the '80s, and with less payoff. Still, fans of Ms. Kinski's body, and films so amateurish they verge on surreal should probably give this a look. NOTE: The DVD also has the singular most pug-ugly company logo/animation I've ever seen! I thought something was wrong with my TV at first. Wow.",1039564800,10,2209,4.6521739130434785
