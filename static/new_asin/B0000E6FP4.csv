1937492,4,B0000E6FP4,"A beautiful young girl named Angela (Sigrid Thornton) is lured away from her job as a hairdresser and into the glamorous world of fashion photography and advertising. A model named Madeline (Thirst's Chantel Contouri doing her best Joan Collins impression) takes Angela by the hand and introduces her to a group of odd, yet endearing characters. Alas, Angela's off-kilter ex-boyfriend, Darrell, and her  domineering mum are set on keeping Angela from escaping their clutches. Darrell is especially odd, w/ his pitiful demeanor, driving everywhere in his Mr. Whippy's ice cream truck! Unfortunately for Angela, he just might be dangerous as well. Then there's Madeline's dirty-old-man husband and a photographer who loves to take pictures of dead animals. All is fine until someone puts a slaughtered pig's head in Angela's bed! That's when things get really weird! Angela finds herself being stalked by a lunatic. The question is, which lunatic is it? SNAPSHOT is sort of long-winded in spots, but has a (slooowwly) building tension and a cool ending...",1218931200,5,1053,5.267857142857143
1937493,3,B0000E6FP4,"This edition is widescreen NOT full screen that I had thought.  In comparing it to the ""Night after Halloween"" VHS version of this film. It does show all the top and bottom so it is not overmasked like other dvds are.  However, there are parts on the vhs that show more on the ""side"" than the dvd!  Especially durring the photo shoot. The dvd has her all the way to the left side of the screen cutting off part of her right side at times. The vhs has her centered, Much closer up and shows her entire right side.  Very Strange, usually it is the vhs that has the side missing.  Quality....Although the vhs is grainy at times, it has much more contrast and brightness.  The dvd looks washed out and blurry in comparison.  In short, not the greatest version of this movie.  If you already have a vhs version, keep it and forget the dvd.  mes.",1118102400,4,840,4.2993630573248405

and stars Aussie actress sigrid thornton as Teen model Angela in Sigrid's first film Debut
also stars Hugh keays burn as the Photographer who played Toecutter in Madmax
and stars Vincent Gill as Angela's stepfather Vince Gill played the Nightrider in Madmax
this film although marketed as a Horror film is only a Drama with some suspense thriller moments mixed in so no Blood or Gore in the film
the U.S. cut goes for only 91mins so the 60mins of the film is filmed as a straight Drama which does Drag on alot
where Angela starts posing for photos for a Mens magazine
so about 70mins into the film is where the suspense starts actually and the Villian at the end of the film is Angela's friend
who got her the Modelling Job so the plot is Lame in my opinion
anyway i got my hopes up thinking it was a Horror thriller film when it definitely isn't it's a straight Drama with some suspense that's it
well U.S. Distributor Vinegar has got the rights to release it for U.S. market which is ABC coded anyway
the U.S. cut at 91mins has new 2k restored 2:35:1 HD transfer which does look excellent about 9/10 picture quality
the sound quality is only 2.0 master mix only which sounds very good anyway
EXTRAS lots of extras, Vinegar has added the Australian version of the film direct from original master VHS source actually
the Aussie cut is Longer version at 99mins and the picture quality does look very Good for a VHS source 1:33:1 ratio
looks like Vinegar made the effort to clean up the picture quality as much as possible i rated it maybe 5-6/10 picture quality
the sound quality is only Mono sound mix taken direct from the VHS so Vinegar only cleaned up the picture quality
there's other extras aswell new audio commentary with some of the cast & crew, Sigrid thornton & Producer Tony Ginnane
there's also new interviews with Sigrid thornton 35mins & Producer Tony Ginnane 30mins
Behind the scenes stills photo Gallery and TV spots, unfortunately the only extra missing is the original theatrical trailer
for some reason Vinegar didn't add either U.S. or AUS trailer's
but i've given 5 stars anyway for this blu-ray/dvd reissue for both versions of the film added on the blu-ray reissue only
the dvd Disc just has the U.S. cut",1515110400,,2314,4.591787439613527
8002064,5,B0000E6FP4,"The movie is a fun, slow burn thriller. Has some creepy moments and memorable visuals, as well as some campy touches. Just don't expect tons of gore or over the top madness. The Blu-ray is a fantastic release, with a new 2k scan and some nice extras.",1509148800,,250,4.340425531914893

8002066,1,B0000E6FP4,I have watched many older movies. I was raised on 70s movies. This just lost it . Too much drama not enough substance. Very boring. I don't recommend it at all.,1508544000,,160,4.193548387096774
8002067,3,B0000E6FP4,"It's billed as horror and it kind of is but it kind of isn't at the same time. The story starts off as a Valley of The Dolls style young girl sucked up into the sleaze industry. In this case, it's topless advertising. So while she's definitely getting taken advantage of, the filmmakers don't want you to feel too terribly gross about it. Game actresses give it their best here. I almost bought that she felt uncomfortable topless despite having seen this actress in multiple films doing the same thing. They got a lot of classic Australian genre/B-film actors in this. It's even got Immortan Joe from Mad Max Fury Road playing a particularly skeazy older rich man.

The big issue is that it's mostly a paint by numbers drama film complete with a sob story that makes you feel sort of bad for the lead actress until you don't because the script requires her to be a bit doltish. It's hard to turn on a cute actress and especially when they are in peril. The actress here is a team player and goes for it. It's a good team play but hurts the movie ultimately.

The last 3rd of the movie is a straight up thriller not far removed from the women in peril by crazy men movies of the 80s and 90s like Silence of the Lambs if it involved less cannibalism and more topless models. The movie really livens up at this point. Everyone knows what to do. Only, you don't really want the character to live. She's kind of moron and kind of a jerk. Serious kudos to any actress willing to commit to that. Especially when it involves having to so heavily play themselves against the audience. Ultimately, sometimes it's ok to not be realistic.

You won't feel like you've wasted your time but it's not the sort of movie you just recommend to people not interested in this particular genre or for that matter the Australian film scene",1505520000,,1817,4.434131736526946

8002070,4,B0000E6FP4,"So the question I asked myself before purchasing this title was can I get it on VHS? The answer was no because I only saw one copy for $75.00 on Ebay. First off I knew about the majority of these films before they got hyped up in Not Quite Hollywood and sold for insane amounts of money on those Ozploitation DVD's . A lot of these Australian genre films were being rented in my local video stores before they went out of business and I've watched many of them. Collectors like myself definitely started looking for some of these titles after that documentary came out and Snapshot is one of them. Not a horror movie it's technically a thriller but pretty decent none the less. I'm assuming alternate titles like A Day After Halloween was marketed to the western audience because it has nothing to do with either the month of October or John Carpenter. It's convenient that this film is on DVD format because a lot of the Ozploitation films are available on VHS only including Midnight Spares and Next Of Kin, both of which I own. Snapshot is a pretty cool film for what it is but i'm not sure if it's worth $30 (that's up to you). If your into these films check out Dead End Drive In,Harlequin, Turkey Shoots, those are all the very best in 80's Australian genre films. Collect em all!",1423872000,3,1286,4.430379746835443

8002072,3,B0000E6FP4,"The Film

A slow paced, soft core psycho suspence/slasher movie without almost any gore sequence except a pig's head in the girl's bed but not bloody at all like a chopped horse head of THE GODFATHER. Please see other reviews for more plot. Climax is a little bit like PEEPING TOM with bunch of flames. Not quite recommendable for those who seek a good bloody slasher, but quite unique for those interested in the Aussie-Film horrorscape from through the late 70's to the 80's, its MadMax Days. You can spot some familiar faces with other films like THIRST, HARLEQUIN (DARK FORCES), PATRICK, ROADGAMES, etc. There is even a moment with everybody is watching Richard Franklin's PATRICK on television.

The Director

Also this is the director SIMON WINCER's first Feature length effort which goes on to HARLEQUIN with Robert Powell, D.A.R.Y.L. with Barret Oliver, THE LIGHTHORSEMEN with many horses, QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER w/ Tom Selleck, LIGHTNING JACK/Paul Hogan, THE PHANTOM/Billy Zane, much more, and even some good horse features like PHAR LAP, THE BLUEGRASS(TVM), and BLACK STALLION.

The Music

Musical underscore is composed by BRIAN MAY, not QUEEN of course, but one of the top film composer in Australia. He usually works on pick-up orchestra with 15-20 musicians, mostly because of the film's tight budget, but in the end, he created the music-closely-directing-the-film-frame-effect, instead of that grand symphony like John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith. You can hear the height of his work with HARLEQUIN, THIRST, ROADGAMES, or THE SURVIVOR. The minimum music with maximum effect with proper right moment. Director Simon Wincer completely agrees with it on his commentary track of the DARK FORCES (HARLEQUIN) DVD special edition (Elite Entertainment).

The DVD PLATINUM edition

Contains weird WIDESCREEN 16 X 9 version with pan and scan. Looks abnormally tight with Top and Bottom, and also both Side of frame. Film grain is also weird like 35 mm blowup from 16 mm film frame. The Film's original aspect ratio is Cinemascope 2.35 X 1, so this is a blowup WIDESCREEN with TOP and BOTTOM cropped from VHS 1.33 X 1 master which was created with SIDEFRAME cropped from an original theatrical 2.35 X 1 CINEMASCOPE aspect ratio. It's sorry enough this wasn't remastered from the original film. This DVD comes with no special features, except a childish TRIVIA GAME, that's all. I really hope that some special edition with right Cinemascope Widescreen DVD will be released in the future.",1364428800,,2488,5.113300492610837
