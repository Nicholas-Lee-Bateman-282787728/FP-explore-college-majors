If you are a fan of any other campy Italian 70's flick (read Fulci and other Italian horror) than you will likely enjoy this fun mafia movie. It's a little slow at times but the camp and character makes up for it.",1513641600,,346,4.028985507246377

8088347,5,B000BKVS2S,"Reknowned Spaghetti Western star and Clarksburg West Virginia native Tony Anthony rules in this great italian-made 1972 gangster movie set in prohibition era New York City. Strangely, many of the exterior shots were done in the small town of Farmington West Virginia. Anyway,it's a must see!!!!Hopefully,some more of his excellent spaghetti westerns will be released on DVD such as Cometogether(1971),Blindman(1971)costarring Beatle Ringo Starr,Get Mean(1976),so DVD distributors take note. Also,if Mr. Anthony ever reads this review,his birthplace Clarksburg West Virginia would be a great location for a West Virginia Spaghetti Western Festival featuring his films considering it's large Italian-American population and the site of one of the greatest annual Italian Festivals ever!!!Take Care!!!",1139443200,12,798,6.133928571428571
