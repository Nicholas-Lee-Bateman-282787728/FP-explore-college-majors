8139216,5,B000HEVTAY,My children (5 & &) adored it. Just as wonderful as I remember.,1510617600,,63,3.923076923076923
8139217,5,B000HEVTAY,"A great story from the period ""between the wars"", interesting to adults as well as children, beautiful scenery and a good reproduction of the original film.  I like this better than the new version, wherein the children are not very nice and the story is ""amped up"".",1490659200,,266,4.659574468085107

8139219,5,B000HEVTAY,"A lovely interpretation of Arthur Ransom's book. However, Ronald Fraser does a very campy portrayal of Uncle Jim, who, in the books, was a tough and capable globe-trotting seafarer and explorer. Should at least have had a beard. A good movie for the grand children when they stay.",1449878400,,280,4.854166666666667
8139220,5,B000HEVTAY,"The movie is based on Arthur Ransome's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book-of-the-same-name/dp/1468306618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book of the same name</a>, which is the first of a 12 book series on Swallows and Amazons.  It was filmed in 1973 in the Lake District in locations that perfectly match descriptions of the setting in the book.  Likewise the storyline faithfully follows the book.  Selection of actors, especially for the roles of Nancy, Titty and Roger, the most animated of the lot is terrific.  They flawlessly portray their characters, but the rest of the actors do just as well.  The movie is simply great for children and family.  It's a clean and enjoyable adventure that won't disappoint anyone familiar with Ransome's books or those appreciating the genre.",1372550400,7,824,5.940677966101695
8139221,5,B000HEVTAY,"I first read Swallows & Amazons when I started building my first yacht 40 years ago and have read a number of Arthur Ransoms other sailing books over the years. he wrote in a time just after the first world war, when sailing small boats was an expression of wealth by the wealthy and a quirky and eccentric activity for those with less money who sailed small, often second hand, old boats that should, by rights, never have put to sea. It was, in short, an activity for the reckless and the brave but, above all, for those with an abiding passion for splashing about in boats. Swalows and Amazons captures this emotion and the times from which it sprang in a charming little tale of children who imagined themselves on the Spanish Main as the bobbed about in dinghies on the Norfolk broads pursuing pirates and ""Primitives"" with all the charm and fervour of children. This was one of Ransom's first, and certainly best known, books, here faithfully translated to screen. A delight.",1296691200,5,981,4.64367816091954
