While the video transfers are sharper than my bootleg versions of the same songs, there is a strange blue cast to the black and white clips, making them more blue and white.

It would have been nice if the packaging told you which shows the clips are from.  Fortunately, the packaging on my bootleg DVD does.

All in all, if you are a Yardbirds fan, this is probably as good a DVD collection as there is.  It's not perfect, but these tracks may not exist in much better condition.",1300147200,13,569,4.371428571428571

8360090,4,B002ARVI5C,"A pretty good collection of Yardbirds TV clips, all performances no interviews, might be the best one out there till someone comes along and does the job right.  You can probably find all or most of these on YouTube somewhere, or on other pieces parts DVDs, but it's nice to have 'em all here in one place.  The quality ranges from very good on most to fair on several.  I counted all live cuts except for 2 mimes, all in b/w save 2 in color.  True there is a slight blue tint to the b/w clips, but it's not distracting or even bad.  The thing that IS bad is they took all these clips from TV 4:3 and stretched them to 16:9.  They are not cropped (as far as I can tell), but reduced vertically and stretched horizontally.  Dammit Jim!  Why you do this to me, Dimi?  Timing wise, you have 52 min of The Yardbirds on 19 cuts, and 31 min of The Zep on 4 cuts = 83 min for those of you in Rio Linda.  A few of the Yardbirds clips are not full length, 3 are hatchet jobs at 1:10, 1:48, and 0:58 (cuts 2, 3, & 5).  Clapton is only on 1 cut, Beck is on 8, Beck & Page are on 2, Page is on 8, then you have the 4 Zeps.  I love seeing the transition from Beck & Page to Page to Zep.  And Pagey doing the bow thing on Dazed with The Yardbirds.  So, not perfect, but mostly very good, and totally worth the $14.54 I paid for it.  Thus highly recommended!  But whenever this gets reissued, PLEASE LEAVE THE 4:3 CLIPS IN 4:3 !!  As you were...",1465603200,,1430,3.926829268292683
8360091,5,B002ARVI5C,"If you are not familiar with this 60's supergroup, this is a great place to start-  The quality is not the greatest, but doable!-  Great music video for a great price!!",1427932800,,168,4.387096774193548
8360092,5,B002ARVI5C,"The Yardbirds are one of the sixties bands who had THE ABSOLUTE BEST AND MOST TALENTED British guitarists play with them, as they seemed to be constantly replacing their lead guitarists. This dvd, The Yardbirds- For Your Love From Yardbirds To Zeppelin, lets you see the rarest films from 1964 to 1968 which showcase the unbelievable talents of The Yardbirds themselves along with the very young Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page. The films themselves are not the greatest quality, mostly being bluish tinted black and white films, but just seeing these rarest of performances and hearing the unbelievable guitars played by the young Clapton, Beck and Page, is worth buying this must have dvd.

The dvd is packed with 23 tremendous songs, most notably is song number 17- Dazed And Confused. This version is sung by The Yardbirds- before Led Zeppelin's tremendous hit. Keith Relf does the vocals every bit as good as Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, and in this 1967 version, Chris Dreja is on rhythm guitar, Jim McCarty is on drums, and Jimmy Page is on lead guitar. Watch Jimmy Page as he takes a cello-type bow to his guitar- his riffs are unbelievable! In this version of Dazed And Confused, there are just 4 Yardbirds now, not the usual 5. Dazed And Confused was brought to The Yardbirds by Jimmy Page. A California born American folk singer and songwriter named Jake Holmes opened for The Yardbirds in 1967 at a concert in England. At this concert, Jake sang a song he just wrote- Dazed And Confused. It's haunting guitar melody and words made Jimmy Page have Jim McCarty go and find and buy Jake Holmes album-The Above Ground Sound Of Jake Holmes- that featured Dazed And Confused on it, which McCarty did. Jimmy Page put his own guitar riffs to it, and played it with The Yardbirds and later with Led Zeppelin, which became a huge hit.

In 2010, Jake Holmes actually filed a law suit after all these decades against Jimmy Page and Led Zeppelin for using his song Dazed And Confused without his permission seeking damages and royalties compensation. Holmes later found out that he could only seek monies for the past 3 years, and after Jimmy Page's release of Celebration Day in 2012, Page actually wrote in the credits, Dazed And Confused written by Jimmy Page, Inspired by Jake Holmes, which left the courts to dismiss Jake Holmes lawsuit, due to the song being ""inspired"" and not copied. If you listen to Jake Holmes original Dazed And Confused song, it sounds way more than just inspired, and it's a shame that Jimmy Page didn't toss poor Jake Holmes just a couple bucks, as it only seems right to give credit where it's due, especially with such a tremendous song.

To know the order of Clapton, Beck and Page on this dvd, is to know the Yardbirds history of the band. The first Yardbirds members in 1963 were: Keith Relf-vocals, harmonica; Anthony ""Top"" Topham-lead guitar; Chris Dreja-Rhythm Guitar; Paul Samwell-Smith- Bass, Backing Vocals and Jim McCarty-Drums, Backing Vocals. In October 1963, Anthony ""Top"" Topham left the band and was quickly replaced by the great Eric Clapton from 1963-1965. The first song on this dvd features Eric Clapton in 1964 playing John Lee Hooker's Louise. This first song is the only song featuring Eric Clapton. Eric Clapton left The Yardbirds to pursue his own music in 1965.

From March 1965 to June 1966, Jeff Beck replaces Eric Clapton becoming the lead guitarist and also does some backing vocals. Songs number 2 through 9 feature Jeff Beck as lead guitarist. In June 1966, bass player Paul Samwell-Smith quits and is replaced by Jimmy Page. Songs 10 and 11 feature BOTH Jeff Beck playing lead guitar and Jimmy Page playing bass. Song 11 is taken from the movie Blow-Up and is in color. In the Fall of 1966, Jeff Beck is fired from The Yardbirds. From November 1966 to July 1968, Jimmy Page is now the lead guitarist for The Yardbirds. Songs 12 to 19 now feature only 4 Yardbirds- Keith Relf, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty and Jimmy Page. In the Fall of 1968, Jimmy Page formed his own band- The New Yardbirds- featuring Robert Plant on vocals, John Paul Jones on bass, John Bonham on drums and Jimmy Page himself on lead guitar. Songs 20 to 23 feature this new band, now newly titled Led Zeppelin. The newly formed band Led Zeppelin appears on a tiny stage and it's great to hear the new band play Dazed And Confused- song number 21.

With it's not great bluish tinted black and white video, but pretty good audio, this dvd is beyond tremendous and worth buying for a Yardbirds, Clapton, Beck, Page or Led Zeppelin fan. The songs are in the correct order of how the Yardbirds progressed with it's ever changing lead guitarists and accurately depicts just how fantastic these young talented musicians were back in the 60's. There are two songs featured in color-number 11 from the movie Blow-Up featuring Beck and Page together, and number 19- Heart Full Of Soul- when the Yardbirds were only a group of 4 with Jimmy Page. This is definitely a 5 Star dvd- the bluish tint doesn't deter from it's rarity- especially hearing The Yardbirds version of Dazed And Confused- which is beyond tremendous.",1408579200,,5144,4.736607142857143
8360093,3,B002ARVI5C,"Since the Yardbirds were hot in the 60's and the video and technology were primitive, I did not expect much from the video.
But there was not much of Eric Clapton. There was plenty of Beck/Page  and Page. But I missed the single from Rave ""Smokestack Lightning.""  The TV productions too many times had the wrong person or instrument on camera during a performance, this DVD had too many guitar isolations and never saw the entire group. that was performing. Was it Beck or Dreja?  I have to admit the Page- Beck guitar combination was terrific and a shame too much internal problems broke up the band in late 1966.  But one man's temper created the best rock band in history- Led Zeppelin with Page, Plant, Bonham and Jones. I got pretty much what I expected",1390780800,,758,4.551470588235294

8360095,1,B002ARVI5C,"This DVD is not an authorized release.  Jimmy Page owns the Yardbirds' name and he would have never approved such a poor quality release.  Several of the videos were taken directly from an authorized 1992 Yardbirds documentary as evidenced by the subtitles in the videos which give the source thereof.  Additionally the entire collection is tinted in a shade of blue which is not how they originally appeared.  The videos were originally shot in a 4x3 format and have been cropped for ""widescreen"" which is great if you don't like seeing the guitarists hands when there is a close up during the solos.  Additionally, the four songs featuring Led Zeppelin are from the official LedZep DVD set which came out approx. ten years ago.  I suspected this was a bootleg when I ordered it and I only bought it to get the few performances here that I did not already have.  I would be more forgiving and would actually recommend this had the bootlegger not cropped the footage.  This (bootleg) DVD is truly for hardcore collectors only.",1367971200,,1026,4.757062146892656
8360096,5,B002ARVI5C,"I also don't understand why the blue tint to the video portion of this, but if you buy this, like I did, for the historic footage of this seminal 60's band, it's just a minor annoyance, quickly overlooked. The only problem with this is that a few of the tracks are cut off short of completion.... I think, probably as a result of incomplete source material rather than bad editing. The fact any of this footage still survives at all is amazing to me. The best and biggest suprise is the Yardbirds / Kieth Relf version of ""Dazed and Confused"". I had never heard this before, or even knew it existed, and here is not only the song, but a live video as well! Worth the price of the DVD by itself!  There are also quite a few other performances here that are not included on a couple of other Yardbirds DVD's I own so this is a great find.
 If you haven't already seen the 2 DVD red sand dune ""Led Zeppelin"" set, you will aslo love the early, early Zep footage, also showh here. Not sure, but this may be their first public performance together. It's hilarious watching the audience sitting on their hands while the band goes at it the way Zeppelin does, only 5 feet away! They obviously didn't quite know what to make of it all.
  Great DVD, highly recommended!",1364774400,,1258,4.340425531914893

8360098,5,B002ARVI5C,"I found this DVD more exciting than other Yardbirds offerings because there were no interviews. It is not that I dislike interviews. I just do not like it when the performances are cut in order to segway into them. The emphasis is on the complete performances here as much as possible. Many of the clips are available on other versions of this material, but here there are fewer edits. There are also less lip-sync performances. Some of the TV clips are done with Keith Relf singing live over the official record's backing track, so they are only ""half live"".
Jeff Beck puts on a great show at the NME show with his genuine vintage Les Paul. Here the audio and video are not what they could have been.
In particular, there is a really good quality live set from French TV that I had not seen before. It is from late in the Jimmy Page era. The great performance from Frankfurt TV ""Beat,Beat,Beat"" is also on this DVD. In addition there is an very early performance of Led Zeppelin on Danish TV, something good to have. These TV performances have good audio and clean video, which compensate for some of the really poor recording techniques on some of the earlier clips.
This DVD has many performances worth having. I believe the running time is 83 minutes. It is a good collection. If you prefer more interviews and documentary material, there are other Yardbird DVDs available. ""The Story of the Yardbirds"" is much more along this line, although there are some really frank comments by Jeff Beck that I enjoyed.
As another reviewer commented, most of the clips have a bluish tone. I did not find that really objectionable, since I was more interested in the material.
Watch out for the speaker blowing company logo at the beginning of the DVD. The rest of the DVD is normal level.",1360540800,5,1780,4.60062893081761
8360099,4,B002ARVI5C,"For Your Love - From Yardbirds to Zeppelin - is a flawed DVD of very good performances.  Many of these clips are unnecessarily tinted blue.  One video does not match the soundtrack.  However, with all those problems, this (so far) is the best resource for these essential bits of Yardbirds (and early Led Zeppelin) history.  You do, in fact, witness the very BIRTH of Led Zeppelin in the concert footage on the last four selections of this DVD.  Even better than that, it gives us a wonderful original Yardbirds version of ""Dazed and Confused"" (in a live performance) with Relf on vocals.

So as far as I know (as of 2011) this DVD is the best available for this material.  I certainly hope that this material will be given a cleaner and better-documented rendering at some point in the future.  The Yardbirds certainly deserve better than this DVD but, as flawed as it is, I am very glad to have these performances.",1321315200,18,916,4.611111111111111
