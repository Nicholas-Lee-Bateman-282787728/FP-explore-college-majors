3619804,5,B001GT9DRK,"I had never heard of the Mushi-shi series before finding one of the volumes in a bargain bin.  It was never on the shelves around here before.  It looked like the stories I would like and the price was right so I gave it a try.  I am SO happy I did!  The stories are very good, quite mature.  (No little boy or monkey screaming its fool head off.)  Also nice that the full set is reasonably priced - some anime is so expensive.  The artwork is good - nothing special but good.  It's the stories that really make this series excellent.

Also: Even though you can now find some of the episodes on some of the streaming Web sites, this set is still worth owning.  (I'm just a customer.)",1243987200,,683,4.184615384615385
3619805,5,B001GT9DRK,"(I left this same review for the starter set disk 1, but wanted to comment on the entire show as well.)

Every now and then I come across an anime that is unlike anything else out there. Mushi-shi is one of these. Not only is the story highly original, the entire production from the music and animation to the packaging and even the English dubbing is outstanding.

This is one of those series that is hard to describe to someone else. I've tried, and I usually get a weird look: ""A wandering medicine man cures people of ails that are caused by supernatural ""bug-like"" organisms called ""mushi""... that means ""bug"" in Japanese....um...well, it's really cool, I promise."" The story really is that simple, but this is one adventure that you just have to experience for yourself. No major story, no complex plot. Just Ginko, the mushi-master, traveling the gorgeous backcountry of Japan and encountering bizarre and fascinating cases of mushi infestation. Some he is able to solve, others nearly cost him his life. The individual episodes range from lighthearted to downright creepy, but always I am left feeling a sense of satisfaction and wonder when the episode is through.

A word about the music in this series. If you use iTunes, look up ""The Sore Feet Song"". This is the opening theme to Mushi-Shi, and I swear every review of this song on iTunes mentions Mushi-shi. I downloaded Ally Kerr's whole album because of this show. Each ending theme for Mushi-shi is specially composed for each episode and fits with the show perfectly.

The more anime I watch, the more I realize that shows like Mushi-shi are rare jewels. There is nothing else in the anime world, besides perhaps Miyazaki, that approaches the level of surrealism, creativity and beauty portrayed in this series.

Mushi-shi won't please everybody. If you demand a complex plot or a lot of action, you won't find it here. But if you are the sort who likes the unconventional and appreciates true quality, don't pass on this show.",1243123200,2,1995,4.821637426900585
3619806,5,B001GT9DRK,"""Mushi Shi"" is about a man named Ginko, who travels around helping people who are having problems due to encounters with creatures called ""Mushi"". Mushi are unusual creatures. For one thing, they seem to be a whole other kingdom of life, distinct from both plants and animals. For another, very few people can actually see them.  Supposedly, they are responsible for many of the old folk tales and legends about ghosts, spirits, etc.

People who can see these creatures (there are many species of mushi) and
choose to study them are called Mushi Masters, or ""Mushi Shi"". In addition to compiling stories and observations, they also try to help people by driving away or destroying troublesome mushi, or teaching people to avoid or cope with them when they can't be exterminated or driven off.

The stories are all told like old Japanese folk tales. There is no
definite chronological sequence to them, and no over-all story arc to the
series. This helps to enhance the ""folk tale"" type atmosphere. Another
thing that gives this series a strong Japanese flavor is that there isn't
always a happy ending or a moral. It's just a story about what happened,
and you make of it what you will.

The artwork in the series is beautiful. The series is set in the mountains of Japan, so the backgrounds are usually green and lush. I wasn't able to figure out a time frame - the series seems to favor a mostly primitive technology, with scrolls rather than books, no electricity, and no internal combustion engines - and yet they have some standard scientific gear, like scalpels and glass slides, microscopes and telescopes. The stories are all told in a laid back manner, and the music (at least the opening song) sounds like something that Paul Simon would have written.

*** small spoiler ***

I think my favorite episode is one about a girl who found a thread hanging down from the sky. She reached out and grabbed it, and was whisked away up into the sky. Ginko found her a little while later, sitting in the top of a tree. He could tell that she had been in contact with a mushi, because she had been affected by it to the point where normal people probably wouldn't have been able to see her. It turns out that she had been caught by a mushi that dwells high in the atmosphere. It tried to eat her, found that she was too big to swallow, and spit her back out. Her good luck was that she landed in a tree. Ginko gave her some medicine to return her to a visible form, and left her in the care of her fianc. Because of her experience, she nearly faded away from our world altogether, but because the love she shared with her fianc served as an anchor, eventually she returned to normal.

*** end spoiler ***

I liked this series. I won't say that it was terribly exciting, but every
episode was interesting, the main character was engaging, and the overall
feel was... comfortable.",1242691200,,2876,4.560077519379845
3619807,5,B001GT9DRK,"I actually first encountered ""Mushi shi"" in the 2006 live-action film directed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>-legend Otomo Katsuhiro. I loved the quiet beauty of the film, and was intrigued to see the animated version. It was, in a world, mesmerizing.

This series is much more beautiful than the film, and because of the length of the series it is a richer and deeper adventure.  I have rarely seen animation of this quality, especially in a television series.  The green tone and emphasis on nature bring to mind some of the lovelier scenes of Miyazaki's work as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausicaa-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>.

The storyline is fairly easy to describe.  It follows the journey of a ""mushi shi"", or ""mushi master"" named Ginko, as he travels around and helps people who are having problems with mushi.  (Funimation was quite wise with the translation of this anime by the way. The word mushi, when written with this kanji, is a difficult one to translate, and I have seen people calling this series ""Bugmaster"" which is a gross mistake.  In this situation it was much better to keep the original Japanese word intact).  An anthology series, Ginko rarely encounters the same people twice, and each episode is fresh and original.  The series can be watched in any order.

The tone of ""Mushi shi"" is very quiet and somber, balancing on the edge of being a ghost story.  There is a definite supernatural theme here, and the mushi themselves remind me of the ""rods"" creatures that occasionally turn up on cryptozoology series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsterquest/dp/B0012XIGXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsterquest</a>.  Anyone who loves Japanese supernatural stories, especially those that use the mystical elements of the natural world, will love ""Mushi shi"".

Special props also get called out to Funimation for their presentation of this series.  I have never seen such a long series packaged so compactly.  There are four disks in two slim cases, which takes up hardly any space at all.  With my DVD collection as large as it is, these kind of space-saving innovations are really appreciated.",1235692800,3,2401,5.915942028985508
3619808,5,B001GT9DRK,"Mushi-shi is a collection of mystical yet sensible tales of nature and its ways, as revealed in the travels of a Mushi-shi (Mushi master). The Mushi, he explains, are expressions of life in its simplest form, below even microorganisms. Set in old Japan, the series chronicles his journeys and treatment of various Mushi forms that at times manifest in the human experience.

The stories and art within this series are expressions of anime as an art form, taken to a new gold standard. I personally like viewing Mushi-shi upon a full-wall projection in the late evening, allowing the anime to transform half the living room into beautiful panoramas of misty mountain valleys, sparkling oceans, and mysterious swamps. This is a series best experienced on quiet, late night evenings.

The stories themselves are immensely engaging, not to mention intriguing. The genius imagination behind them, and the direction to realize such genius within the anime art form, is truly something to behold.

Some other animes I like, for perspective: bebop, lain, GTO, perfect blue, grave of the fireflies, spirited away. This anime is most like spirited away, only with many, many episodes.

Highly recommended for even the most discriminating anime connoisseur.",1234742400,2,1246,5.2462311557788945

3619810,4,B001GT9DRK,"This review will concern itself with the material product as those reading this review and considering its purchase have likely already been ensnared by this wonderful series and need no proclamation of its virtues. The box that contains the DVDs is quite slim-all four DVDs being within the cozy confines of 2 slimcases; in fact, the jacket is maybe the width of one and a half traditional DVD cases and is made of thinner board than I am used.  Depending on the inclinations of your personality and the limitations of your shelves, the diminutive nature of the collection may be a boon or a curse.  Myself?  I was a bit low about it-it is outboxed by the other boxes on my shelves and I feel that it deserves greater prominence.  With consideration given to the current asking price for the purchase of the 6 volumes separately (at this time roughly $160), however, I find myself perfectly content to value the collection as a very special treasure hiding amidst my trove and awaiting future discovery.  Another issue is therein raised-Mushi-shi previously had the luxury of 6 DVD discs in which to dwell and now finds itself bound to 4 (7 episodes each on the first 3 discs and 5 on the last).  How does it fare?!!  Rest easy-the beauty remains and is crisp and detailed in both the picture and the audio.  Of course-extras/special features ARE quite limited (being ""Interview with the Director"", ""Actor/Director Commentary"", ""Studio Tour"", ""Manga Pages"", and the ever popular ""Textless Opening""), but that is to be expected for a steal like this.  Overall this item IS a steal _if_ you love the series and are satisfied with the media in its isolated state.  If you desire T-shirts and your very own Mushi all boxed away in an original Ginko Mushi-shi crate (for this price, I should say-who wouldn't want that?) you had best look elsewhere.  All other comers-you won't be disappointed!!!",1230681600,8,1892,4.808641975308642
3619811,5,B001GT9DRK,"I was a latecomer to Mushi-shi, mostly because I'm very picky when it comes to watching anime.  I became intrigued by the series' description, and a short clip sealed the deal.  After the first episode, I was completely captivated.  Mushi-shi has not only become my favorite anime series, it's one of the best visual works I've ever seen.

The show revolves around Ginko, who spends his days travelling rural Japan in search of ""mushi"" - beings somewhere between animal and plant, neither good nor evil.  In each standalone episode, a mushi has affected a person in a different way, and Ginko must decipher the reasons and concoct a cure.

While the premise may sound tedious, it's anything but.  Ginko is a fascinating character: likable yet mysterious; a wanderer with a purpose that unfolds without hurry.  The people Ginko meets have their own tale to tell, whether it be a man obsessed with rainbows, a boy who's gained a new sense of hearing, or a girl thought to be a living god.  Each episode is memorable due to the characters who compose it, and the series ends up being endlessly interesting due to the inventiveness and versatility of the cast involved.  While the people are left behind at the close of each episode, there are new ones to meet.

Besides its unusual structure, Mushi-shi is simply beautiful to experience.  The dub is one of the best I've heard; Travis Willingham is perfect as Ginko.  The music is minimal and subtle, but evokes emotion in a delicate manner.  While there isn't much action in the series, the animation is superb, featuring a delicate and muted palette that's instantly captivating.  Much of the series is like watching a moving painting.

The greatest thing about Mushi-shi, however, is its theme: connection between living beings.  While each episode is about a person infected by a mushi, under the surface, it's also about how one's decisions affect his or her relationships with the surrounding world, for good and ill.  It's no accident that Mushi-shi is set in the country; the show simply would not work in an urban setting, as the connection between human and nature is often explored.

Mushi-shi is totally unlike any other anime I've seen.  There are no giant robots, aliens, screaming combatants, devious plans, high-school romances, possessed children, etc etc.  It's a mature, quiet, thoughtful, and peaceful show, despite the conflict explored in each episode.  I should say that this is probably not a show for children, as it can be quite dark and frightening, and while not explicitly graphic in nature, there are occasional implied acts of violence.

Mushi-shi is not a show to be rushed through, but savored and shared.  It is multi-layered without being complex, and was nothing less than a profound journey to experience.  This anime is a true labor of love, and I hope you make the choice to travel with Ginko.",1229904000,65,2879,4.88659793814433
3619812,5,B001GT9DRK,"Mushi-Shi is a gorgeous anime that is made up of 26 self-contained episodes that don't have anything to do with another, but introduce you to the new types of Mushi that the main character discovers, documents and solves the mystery behind.

It's not ""slow-paced,"" but it definitely has the pacing of a mystery/suspense show like Law & Order or The X-Files, not a shonen-type fighting show. This is a more mature, adult show with nearly perfect animation, wonderful voice acting and music (at least on the Japanese side) and definitely worth a watch. Since each episode is self-contained, you don't have to worry about taking breaks between watching--you won't forget anything you needed to remember. :)

It's also worth noting that the episodes are ""out of order"" compared to the original manga, but as they're self-contained, it doesn't really matter. The manga also continues after where Mushi-Shi the anime ends, and I'm hoping they make a second season.",1229299200,32,958,5.056962025316456

3619829,5,B001GT9DRK,"This show is a subtle work of art. One reviewer complained about the lack of plot development, and he's correct (though inadequate in his articulation). This show has no overall plot. Each episode uses a fairly simple mystery plot structure as a vehicle for a larger exploration.

That exploration is of the human condition expressed through the condition of all living things. The Mushi, fantasy-esque creatures who exist just outside of our world while still interacting with it, are shown at a rate of one primary focus per episode as creatures who are victims of nothing more than their own evolutionary biology. There is no science in this show, and it is fantasy, not science fiction. However thematically the show draws upon the idea that all living things affect each other simply by their methods of existence, without intent.

Through this theme it becomes an exploration of all living things as well as the nature of the human condition. The only continuing character in this short series is Ginko, the mushi master whose travels we follow. There is some non-linear character development via the depiction of various stages of his life in different episodes. We learn more about him as the show continues.

However the primary focus of the show is the Mushi and the people they affect. We change characters and settings every episode to show people displaying different traits and methods of survival. The mushi inevitably make an impact on the lives of an individual or large group. Ginko has to figure out how the Mushi lives and thus how to deal with it. Ginko is also one of the few Mushi masters who sees them as fundamentally innocent lifeforms. He has essentially transcended moral absolutism into a relativistic bio-ethics which many other characters in the show embody (often against the grain of their social context).

Of course the show is not so heavy-handed. All of this is simply there to be appreciated. Each episode is the emotional life journey of a character or two who has encountered a Mushi, usually unintentionally. The visuals are gorgeous. The depiction of the Mushi is easily uniquely appreciated. You could turn off the sound and enjoy many of the visuals on their own, however as others have mentioned you would be missing out on the entirety of the experience for which I cannot find an element to complain about.

The show is thematically deep, visually arresting, and emotionally affecting in its storytelling. If you seek conventional multi-act arcs in archetypal mythic structure, you will likely not enjoy this. However if you identify with artistry and sense of wonder telling intellectually important stories while not becoming heavy handed or losing emotional affect, this is the show you've been looking for.

The extras are pretty extensive, the packaging is simple, and the songs are great. But, there is one huge issue.

I was playing this on my ps3, which has an hdmi cable linked up to an hd television. I was really excited to watch the first episode. But, I was slapped in the face with grainy visuals. The visuals are really, really grainy. Even in bright colors, there is still high grain. Now, I don't know if it is just my copy, or if other people had this problem with the second viridian collection. Can somebody please tell me if they had this problem, or if they didn't? I checked all four discs, and they are all grainy. If I could get help, that would be great.

By the way, before you respond, please watch an episode and look in the dark colors. Look for grains of course.

3619850,5,B001GT9DRK,"In the anime Mushi-shi, literally meaning ""spirit or mushi hunter or mushi master"", we meet Ginko and he is one of these Mushi-shi a ""Mushi Master"". He wanders the lands in search of these strange creatures called the Mushi.
As Ginko travels the across lands he studies the Mushi and teaches those he encounters how to live in harmony with these mysterious spirits.
Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware they even exist.
Sometimes these Mushi are completely harmless to all, but in some cases they are very dangerous, if not deadly, to deal with. As Ginko says in not so many words in one episode, they are like a bothersome neighbor that you have to put up with and can't really do anything about it. You have to find the balance and go on with your life and accept the fact that they are real and you must deal with that fact.

The Mushi are more primitive than animal, plant or bacteria, yet they are closer to any source of life we as humans know. They are at the heart of all life, a living river of lifeforce.
Ginko journeys through a world that resembles medieval Japan. The series is episodic in nature and there are a few recurring characters besides Ginko as he returns to those he's helped from time to time. His payment for his services? Just a few Mushi related items, strange and sometimes dangerous objects. As we see in one episode about a beautifully crafted inkstone.

Speaking of beautiful, the artwork and animation by Artland is phenomenal. The backgrounds in Mushi-shi look real at times, like you could jump right in and join Ginko. I do envy Ginko, what an amazing life he leads.

As the story goes on from one town and person dealing with a Mushi problem to the next etc, you find yourself wondering about Ginko as well. How did he get his unusual white hair and green eye color? Why can he not stay in one place for very long?
As the answers come, you'll be delighted by this wonderful and gorgeous anime.

Of course alot of you know about this anime. However, if you are one of those on the fence about purchasing Mushi-shi. By all means please jump right in, but don't stare at the river of light for to long.

The series is 26 episodes long and is licensed by FUNimation in the U.S. There are several boxsets available, and the singles are still floating around out there too. It's an instant classic, and even though it's episodic, I think it's also a great 'gateway' anime. Something to enjoy with your friends and family alike.

So, journey across the land with Ginko and discover with him the epic beauty of the Mushi and experience first hand the danger of being a Mushi-shi.",1298851200,,2668,4.50206611570248
3619851,4,B001GT9DRK,"Just finished Mushishi today. I can't say I loved it...but I can't say I hated it either. It's a very calm anime and I almost felt soothed watching it, but it definitely wasn't `hold onto your seats!' interesting. The animation was especially lovely to look at, but all the characters (besides Ginko) were rather plain. But I think this created a great effect because the colorful/fascinating Mushishi that floated about these plain looking characters really made the magic of the Mushi stand out due to the color contrast. It makes it seem as though the world belongs to nature and the Mushi, and humans are just trying their best to survive in it. Although the opening song...I hated it as far as music goes. It was all in English and it was a song that matched the series, but I just don't like listening to that kind of music. The opening animation sequence was also ridiculously boring. But...I'd have preferred it open with artistic views of light shining through trees (like it did) than some silly peppy opening that shows all the characters Ginko encounters on his journeys.

This is a `monster of the week' type anime....or in this case a `mushi of the week' type anime. Each episode is about a particular Mushi and the effect it has on the lives on the humans around them. Anime News Network said it best on their review of volume 3 of the manga of this series...""you half-expect the mushi to pipe up at the end with: `And we would have gotten away with it, if it hadn't been for you meddling mushishi!' ""

I don't go out of my way to recommend this anime to people because it feels like a big hit or miss show. But if someone ever asked for a calming/soothing anime this would be the first one that pops to mind. This anime would be a good way to follow up any anime that was an exhausting roller coaster of emotions. I like Ginko as a character and I enjoyed this series. Mushishi made me feel like I was peeking into the sinmple past of old rural Japan. If more Mushishi comes out I plan on watching it. After watching the anime I found myself reading the manga, the anime properly represents the manga. But I prefer the manga over the anime.

3619852,5,B001GT9DRK,"Not only all but two of the stories are from actual Japanese folktales, but the backgrounds are like traditional Japanese watercolor paintings.  The characters are poorly drawn, but the stories and over all artwork is so stunning...who cares.",1295481600,,242,5.368421052631579
3619853,4,B001GT9DRK,"If you'd like something a little different from your anime, Mushi-Shi might be for you. It is a gorgeously animated show, with truly lovely watercolour-style visuals, set in old Japan, with careful attention paid to period costumes and architecture. There is a supernatural element in the form of ""mushi,"" or invisible spirit-like beings with magical powers, which apparently exist all around humans, and often have profound effects on people's lives. However, the show avoids most of the usual cliches. There are no battling samurai, magical schoolgirls, or giant robots. The show's protagonist is a ""mushi master"" named Ginko who wanders around the countryside, observing people's encounters with mushi and sometimes helping them deal with these situations. He's somewhere between magician and scientist (also, for some reason, he wears a shirt and pants instead of a kimono) but most of the time he acts as an impartial observer of human nature.

For the most part, the mushi are plot devices that cause people to experience intense emotions or moral crises. Many of the situations are memorable and poetic. One man is so struck by a vision of a rainbow that he spends his life chasing after rainstorms. A woman accidentally gives a magical potion to her husband that forces him to live with her in a forest, unable to leave. Another man lost his wife at sea, and waits for her clothes to wash ashore for years afterward. A starving artist painted his first picture on the inside of his own coat, which apparently took on magical powers. A certain village sacrifices people to the ocean, only to have them reborn anew. These stories offer many good moments of reflection. The characters are frequently subject to strong feelings of guilt, obligation, or regret, cutting deeper than the typical motivation offered in anime. Although the storyline is episodic, and there is only one recurring character aside from Ginko himself, the show still offers many convincing portraits of inner turmoil, and the numerous one-time characters are still able to demonstrate the kind of intense introspection that people engage in when their lives undergo dramatic changes.

Some episodes have a more chilly and creepy atmosphere. The most noteworthy one of these is a story about a couple whose child was killed and then replaced by human-looking mushi, with clear pod-people overtones. Yet, there's an emotional angle there as well: Ginko figures out the imposture immediately, but the wife (who lost her baby from a previous pregnancy) is so desperate to have children that she refuses to believe him. Fate is a big theme of the show, with many episodes where Ginko can clearly predict the unhappy conclusion, but is powerless to prevent it. Ginko himself is a likeable character, not analyzed extensively, but given just enough backstory to put a tragic tinge on his wandering.

So, the mushi are used to drive some pretty great ideas, but they can also become a problem. Every episode features a different type of mushi. Mushi come in many flavours -- flying, insect-like, plant-like, predatory, and so forth -- and every episode features a new species. As a result, Ginko always spends way too much time telling you each mushi's name (also reminding you that mushi are invisible) and explaining its habits and life cycle in tiresome detail. The real draw is the guy trapped in the forest, first longing for his past village life and then grieving over his wife's sacrifice, not the biological functions of the bamboo-like mushi, whose name I already forgot. The weaker episodes are ones that try to focus more on the mushi. There's one about a girl who pities them, and a couple more that dwell on details about the ""river of light,"" which is something made up of mushi that is apparently dangerous to look at. The problem is that mushi are drawn as little squiggles, difficult to empathize with, and the whole Lifestream concept isn't really original enough to merit the attention.

Fortunately, the show always looks pretty. There are beautiful green misty hills, swirling clouds, pink springtime flowers, raging oceans, pristine snowfields and dense forests. Nature plays a big role in the world. Humans mostly live in tiny villages, with occasional conflicts on a small scale (e.g. the villagers' prejudice against a particular family), but with no war or crime. The show's meditative nature is a welcome respite from the typical good-versus-evil or boy-gets-girl generic anime plots. It's not surprising that it only lasted for 26 episodes (any more and it might have become repetitive or boring), but it's a fascinating experiment that puts anime to bigger and better use than the norm.",1292976000,10,4686,5.050387596899225
3619857,5,B001GT9DRK,"This was an excellent Anime series.  It isn't very long, but it tells a complete story in the time it is given.  It is also good for people who don't want to have to remember a lot from story to story, as most of it can be viewed without knowledge of other episodes.  I highly recommend this, as the artwork is fantastic, and I enjoyed the dubbing.  The voice actors worked very well with the story.  I like to watch dubbed because I want to watch everything without reading it.  Great story, great action, lots of feeling.  Would recommend in a heart beat.",1290470400,,557,4.349514563106796
3619858,5,B001GT9DRK,"Mushi-shi is great. Ginko the mushi master travels around studying mushi and helping people affected from encounters with the mushi. He's essentially Dr. House of turn of the century Japan. I refer to him as Dr. House because of the way he thinks outside the box in his treatment of the people afflicted and his desire to not harm the mushi when possible.
  There's no wackiness , robots , fan service or other usual anime stuff. There's just series of great stories that are very interesting and entertaining . The mushi themselves are as varied as any life form , everything from microscopic to enormous and all with different results with contact with humans. The show also does a really good job of making you get emotionally attached to the victims of the encounters, you really want these people to get cured.
So if you want a good show to enjoy , then pick up Mushi-shi.",1287446400,2,877,4.615384615384615
3619859,5,B001GT9DRK,"Ginko is a Mushishi - an expert on Mushi, odd spirit-like creatures not everyone can see and that occasionally cause harm to unwary humans. Ginko travels Japan studying Mushi and helping solve problems related to them, such as a village paralyzed by rust mushi, or a bamboo mushi that traps travelers in its forest. Each episode stands on its own, telling of a different place with different mushi, with Ginko observing and assisting when needed.

This is a very languid, beautiful series. Ginko does have a backstory that is eventually revealed, but the series focus is individual episodes. The scenery and mushi combine to create a delightful viewing experience, and the stories are engaging, quickly drawing you in to the world they create. Watching this show made me feel relaxed and I came away from each episode with a contented, peaceful feeling. Not that the stories are boring - since Ginko is a healer like character, most of the stories involve people who are suffering from their contact with the mushi. But the resolutions are normally uplifting and satisfying.

If you are looking for an action show, this is not it. If you are looking for a show that has an continues storyline, this is also not it. But if you want a show that you can just watch and enjoy on an episodic basis, that has emotional stories and beautiful scenery, please give this show a try. So far everyone I've showed this series to has enjoyed it, and I hope you will too!

3619863,5,B001GT9DRK,"This is a well done anime series.  The music, color, narration and dialogue are extremely minimal, yet extremely intimate and endearing. There are 26 episodes, each lasts about 23 minutes and deals with one particular natural (or rather unnatural) phenonmenon and/or unexplainable human disease. The approach is from a mythological and anthropological point of view. Although the main character (Mushishi) is dressed in modern clothing, all the other characters are dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. I read it somewhere that based on the costumes and other clues from the original magna series, the period the stories supposed to take place was estimated to be around the beginning of the 20th-century. Before you know it, you are drawn deeply into each story. But when it is done, you always come out with a feeling of loss and sympathy for all those human characters and sometimes the mushi that are involved.

I like traditional old Japanese style art and architecture and this anime has a lot of the style. Slow paced, almost thoughtful with weird twists in plots. Each episode is more or less standalone with central character and different manifestations of Mushi being common thread. About 1/3 of the way into the series you learn how he got to be a Mushi master and why his hair is silver and why he has only one green eye (other is glass). I really liked it. No fan service or T&A and big eyed girls and guys. Takes place in the country side of mid 1800's Japan from what I can tell. Main character wears western style clothes why every one else is in traditional garb. Plots are a little dark as Mushi are creatures of the world we don't see, but that interact with us, usually in a negative or benign way.  The Mushi master is like an exorcist being able to see them while normal people cannot, and get rid of them or treat the maladies they cause.",1268611200,,1055,4.328282828282828
3619865,5,B001GT9DRK,"I actually first encountered ""Mushi shi"" in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2006-live-action-film/dp/B002BWD74G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2006 live-action film</a>&nbsp;directed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akira/dp/B00005MAM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akira</a>-legend Otomo Katsuhiro. I loved the quiet beauty of the film, and was intrigued to see the animated version. It was, in a world, mesmerizing.

This series is much more beautiful than the film, and because of the length of the series it is a richer and deeper adventure. I have rarely seen animation of this quality, especially in a television series. The green tone and emphasis on nature bring to mind some of the lovelier scenes of Miyazaki's work as in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nausicaa-of-the-Valley-of-the-Wind/dp/B0001XAPZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>.

The storyline is fairly easy to describe. It follows the journey of a ""mushi shi"", or ""mushi master"" named Ginko, as he travels around and helps people who are having problems with mushi. (Funimation was quite wise with the translation of this anime by the way. The word mushi, when written with this kanji, is a difficult one to translate, and I have seen people calling this series ""Bugmaster"" which is a gross mistake. In this situation it was much better to keep the original Japanese word intact). An anthology series, Ginko rarely encounters the same people twice, and each episode is fresh and original. The series can be watched in any order.

The tone of ""Mushi shi"" is very quiet and somber, balancing on the edge of being a ghost story. There is a definite supernatural theme here, and the mushi themselves remind me of the ""rods"" creatures that occasionally turn up on cryptozoology series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsterquest/dp/B0012XIGXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsterquest</a>. Anyone who loves Japanese supernatural stories, especially those that use the mystical elements of the natural world, will love ""Mushi shi"".

Special props also get called out to Funimation for their presentation of this series. I have never seen such a long series packaged so compactly. There are four disks in a single DVD case, which takes up hardly any space at all. With my DVD collection as large as it is, these kind of space-saving innovations are really appreciated.

Like other releases in Funimation's ""Viridian Collection,"" this box set of ""Mushi-shi"" is a re-release offering a more ""bare bones"" presentation at a lower price.",1263340800,9,2703,6.255376344086022

3619898,5,B001GT9DRK,"I avoided Mushi-Shi for a long time because I didn't like the way the main character was drawn on the box. When I finally gave it a chance, I was blown away. The show is barely about the main character (Ginko), really. In fact, it is the mysterious ""Mushi"" that are the true stars of the show. Each episode centers around the strange little ""Mushi"" and the people being plagued by the little creatures. Ginko is more of a host, explaining the Mushi to the audience. It reminds of paranormal shows like ""X-files"" in that regard.
The anime is calm and understated. There are no giant robot battles, and no teenage boys nervous about aggressive girls. The tone is slow and purposeful. It never feels like the story is dragging, though. It's just right :)
One of the greatest aspects of Mushi-Shi, is the music. I haven't been captivated by an anime soundtrack like this since ""Noir."" The music matches the understated execution of the visual elements. The music is calm and simply beautiful. Sometimes gentle, sometimes haunting, the music perfectly compliments each scene. Well, all except the opening theme song (""the sore feet song""), which makes me want to put a pencil in my ear :)
Mushi-Shi is in a rare class of anime. Not just because it's so good, but because it's so different. If you haven't tried Mushi-Shi yet, go for it. You may find it's a gem to add to your collection.",1259452800,3,1382,4.621951219512195
3619899,5,B001GT9DRK,"As an avid Anime viewer, I watch a lot of Anime of varying genres. Mushi-shi is the story of nature, from a fantasy-entrenched perspective. In a different existence, there are life forms called Mushi, which are essentially the purest life forms,  that live among people. Usually, they go undetected and do not disturb human beings. Occasionally, however, they sometimes can have negative effects, depending on what they require to survive. Some feed off light, while others feed off the gods themselves. Mushi-shi takes place in a much older period in Japan. Ginko, the main character, is a Mushi master, who travels around helping people with Mushi-related problems. Each episode tells the story of a different issue created by Mushi and how Ginko solves the issue. Unlike other Mushi masters, Ginko doesn't simply resort to killing the Mushi, and instead finds ways for people to live with them.

Mushi-shi is not a series that employs action, suspense, character development, or a connected plot. Instead, it uses beautiful artwork, interesting twists, and philosophical messages to remain an impressively unique series. 26 episodes long, this series is long enough to have an incredible diversity in stories told, and plenty of non-recurring characters. It also stays short enough to not overstay its welcome. Any longer, and the series would likely have lost it's value as a series with vague and transparent continual plot.

What Mushi-shi truly has going for it is it's environmental beauty. Everything is serene and peaceful, and the series has a definite air of mysticism to rival any Anime ever made. The Viridian Collection version has Both Japanese and English voice work (with English subtitles) and the special features are numerous and interesting. Mushi-shi is by far my favorite Anime ever made. Watch it if you desire a slower paced series focused more on philosophical virtues and less on action.",1256083200,27,1915,5.190938511326861
3619900,5,B001GT9DRK,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but decided to purchase this series on a whim since it was well regarded on [...]. I was looking for another seinin or josei anime to sink my teeth into and this fit the bill more than I ever would have expected.

Each episode pretty much stands alone, however I would still suggest watching in chronological order as the character is revealed and develops from episode to episode.  He's a great protagonist - mysterious and enigmatic but you come to love him and laugh with him. The storytelling in each episode was captivating and made me feel like a child again exposed to a whole new world of unusual beings.  In the same way I grew up wondering about fairies, dragons and unicorns from the stories I read, Mushishi made me wonder about the details of the mystical creatures they dreamed up called mushi.

The box set is nice - very simple, slim and complete.  The cover is nice but not at all obviously ""anime"" so if you're not one who displays your anime habit for the world to see, you can comfortably include this on your shelves ;).  There is the original Japanese with English subtitles and an English dub.  The special features are also worthwhile as they have an interview with the Japanese director which is pretty interesting as well.

I can't adequately describe how this series affected me.  The music in each episode was great.  The art and animation was different if not unusual, but so perfect for the story. A series I could easily re-watch over and over again.  I think this series will probably impress most people - particularly if you are an adult who still finds themselves fascinated with classic dark fairy tales and cultural mythology.  I think younger audiences could also watch if they're already comfortable and familiar with darker stories (like a classic Grimm's fairy tale or a Greek myth) but I believe much of it would go over their heads.  In any case, this series is very highly recommended.",1251417600,5,1959,4.659883720930233
3619901,4,B001GT9DRK,"If you like watching the countryside of Medieval Japan rendered in marvelous colours, this is the anime for you. The director is right in the interview: the maximum effort they put into the backdrop and scenery was absolutely worth it. If only, some more effort were shown in the variety of character design too. Unfortunately, all the female, and most of the male, characters have the same countenance. It did not pose a problem for the first two disks, but by the time I got to the third, there was a ""not again"" feeling when the faces of a new episode appeared on the scene. Fortunately, the personalities showed much more variety.

However, not even the scarcity of ""players"" stopped me watching. Why? Because the timing and pacing of each of these stories are like eastern meditation. The background music is without too much variation and of repetitive nature, but you do not mind it at all. The opening song was a little more bothersome by the end of the series. But it's a product of the (commercial) west, so it is understandable. (I never watched more than half a disk a day. Generally tried to keep it as low as two episodes a day.) Most of the stories do not show too much variation either. Most have some predictable turns of events. The only thing you cannot always predict if they will have a happy ending or not. Or if such a thing as a happy ending exists at all. Not all of the problems are or can be solved. Not everyone is fully cured. Not all deaths can be avoided. It's not always the skill of the Mushi-shi that saves the day.

Recommendation: try to see one or two episodes online. It's really not a problem if they are not episode one and two. The stories are self-contained and the quality of the series is quite even. If it seems to be your style, buy the whole box. It's worth its price. Of course, if you are of the patient type, try to wait for a better bargain.

3619906,4,B001GT9DRK,"Just finished Mushishi today. I can't say I loved it...but I can't say I hated it either. It's a very calm anime and I almost felt soothed watching it, but it definitely wasn't ""hold onto your seats!"" interesting. The animation was especially lovely to look at, but all the characters (besides Ginko) were rather plain. But I think this created a great effect because the colorful/fascinating Mushishi that floated about these plain looking characters really made the magic of the Mushi stand out. It makes it seem as though the world belongs to nature and the Mushi, and humans are just trying their best to survive in it. Although the opening song...I hated it as far as music goes. It was all in English and it was a song that matched the series, but I just don't like listening to that kind of music. The opening animation sequence was also ridiculously boring. But...I'd have preferred it open with artistic views of light shining through trees (like it did) than some silly peppy opening that shows all the characters Ginko encounters on his journeys.

This is a 'monster of the week' type anime...or in this case a 'mushi of the week' type anime. Each episode is about a particular Mushi and the effect it has on the lives on the humans around them. Anime News Network said it best on their review of volume 3 of the manga of this series...""you half-expect the mushi to pipe up at the end with: 'And we would have gotten away with it, if it hadn't been for you meddling mushishi!'

I don't go out of my way to recommend this anime to people because it feels like a show that is either a big hit or a big miss.

The theme is about a traveling sort of Mr. Fix-it, Ginko, who specializes in addressing problems caused by some very Japanese-inspired mythic creatures called mushi (bug in Japanese). So you can say he fixes bugs. Maybe he could have been an IT expert in modern times, but thankfully for us it takes place in rural pre-industrial Japan; way more interesting. Every episode describes each of his encounters and they could all be stand-alone because chronology is not so important to a drifter-type character like Ginko. What I like most about it though is that it's not predictable. Not every incident has a happy outcome and the touching drama can be almost scooped up with your hands. At least check it out online even it sounds like you wouldn't be interested. You might be surprised.",1416009600,2,935,4.777777777777778
8307062,5,B001GT9DRK,One of the most beautiful visually and plot wise.,1406592000,,49,4.555555555555555
8307063,5,B001GT9DRK,"The interpersonal relationships, dialogues and every new character is very well written, realistic, and has their own unique perspectives. There is subtle humor occasionally, but most of the time it's a curiosity-driven viewing. The intro song sets the tone for a peaceful yet unique and mysterious story.

If you're looking for unusual tales that don't end how you expect, watch this series.

One of my favourite anime series, I highly recommend this. Especially on a rainy day or just before going to sleep.",1402963200,,509,5.120481927710843
8307064,5,B001GT9DRK,"I'm not a big anime fan; there is nothing else like this series that I have encountered.  These are understated, slightly left-of-center, slightly like ghost stories but not horror stories.  I have watched these multiple times over the years since I have purchased. You can't watch too many in one sitting but you can go on a kick and watch a few every night.  They are a bit melancholic; slightly creepy and reassuring at the same time.  Brilliant.  Like if Thomas Mann or Hesse were Asian and slightly comforting; I cannot explain.  Interesting interpretations into local folk legends, many slice of life tales from small villages with the local folklore with the spin that the Mushi Master interprets.  Must see.

Humans get into trouble sometimes with this other realm, like a fourth dimension, or parallel universe, that at times intersects with ours; because we do not regularly interact with it, we are particularly vulnerable to it.  The Mushi-Shi Masters travel around and can ""see"" these energies more readily than other people, but they have their own vulnerabilities and bring those to the trade.  The inexplicable illnesses or strange behaviors are often the Mushi exerting influence on humans.  But once it starts, even after the humans are aware of it, the humans don't want to give it up.",1394236800,,1304,4.9631336405529956
8307065,5,B001GT9DRK,"I bought this collection because I HAD TO have my own copy after seeing it at my sister's. Yes, its that good! Highly recommend this to anyone of all anime walks of life! Its the most beautiful animation and story I've ever seen! This is what anime should be all about! Watch this, you will not regret it! Plus, the voice actor is that of Roy Mustang's!
If you like mystery, science, and supernatural phenomena, well someone took all these, blended them, baked them and here's the cake!
Ginko is one of the rare humans in this era who is able to see Mushi, supernatural microscopic (at times) beings who are part of the world. They are in the air, in the water, in grass- everywhere, kind of like ghosts. These little creatures are just going about their business but humans unexpectedly get in the way. When this happens, the Mushi influence their health, their dreams and their actions.  And so here is were Ginko comes in, helping the people who've been in contact with Mushi and don't even know it. Depending on what type  these mushi are, Ginko gives antidotes, and ""cures"" people from these ""curses"" but sometimes he stumbles on a Mushi he has never seen before and has to go detective on the little things, before they cost someone their life! My favorite episodes are ""The White Which Lives Within the Ink Stone"", ""Where the Sea Meets Man"" and ""Pickers of Empty Cacoons"" but all of them are a must see! I watched the whole thing three times!",1390089600,,1449,4.547892720306513
8307066,4,B001GT9DRK,"Mushishi is what I would consider a ""green"" anime, much like Princess Mononoke, it is series based on the acclaimed seinen manga by Yuki Urushibara, and as a seinen series, it is far more mature and subtle than most action packed cliched shonen series like Dragonball and Naruto. Because of this, many younger viewers may be bored or uninterested in such a slow paced supernatural drama, but for those with higher attention spans and more mature tastes, Mushishi will be right up your alley. It focuses on a Mushi master named Ginko, who is the main character of the series and something of a witch doctor, as he helps ""cure"" people who have various problems arising from their interactions with Mushi, which are ethereal creatures living amongst the oceans, forests, and mountains of historical Japan. Mushishi takes place in an earlier, more quiet era when most people all over the world lived much closer to nature than we do today. The people who inhabit the series live amongst misty green mountains, pristine lakes and rivers, and dark, mysterious oceans. It is a world most people today could hardly imagine, and that is what makes this series so fascinating to modern viewers, because of how alien how it is but at the same time it touches upon something hidden and forgotten in our own natures, the world of our ancestors and how we to some extent have lost the beauty and purity they must have taken for granted. Mushishi is an episodic as opposed to story based series and because of this you can watch pretty much any episode without worrying about missing anything important, also Ginko is one of the few recurring characters aside from a man named Adashino who collects valuables that Ginko acquires on his travels. One last thing is that despite the highly detailed and beautiful quality of the animation, the character designs are quite ordinary and very similar, which could also be a problem for some viewers, but luckily if you're like me, you'll be able to look past all of these aforementioned negatives and see this series for the wonder that it is. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.",1383004800,2,2112,4.773224043715847
8307067,5,B001GT9DRK,"From the soft-spoken voice acting to the windchime-ridden soundtrack, there is probably nothing more stress-relieving than this show.  It's lack of an overarching plot line can basically have you watch these episodes ""on shuffle"" and you aren't missing anything.  The slight paranormal tone to Mushi-Shi is more whimsical than scary.  I am in love with this show.",1374019200,,363,5.333333333333333
8307068,5,B001GT9DRK,"Mushiishi is an amazing show, especially in contrast to much of what gets released in the United States.  It is a naturist anime, with heavy drama and light horror themes.  The episodes are stand alone short stories with occasional links between episodes.  Set in a timeless-seeming period where nearly everyone still wears traditional Japanese clothing, it tells the story of a mushi-master named Ginko who travels around studying mushi and helping to cure conditions they have caused.  Mushi are a variety of primal life forms with strange, sometimes terrifying behaviors like eating sound or pretending to be false-fire that chills those who try to warm themselves by it.  I give this show my highest recommendations, especially to those who do not normally enjoy anime.  As of writing this review, Mushi-shi can be seen on Netflix.",1369872000,,835,5.148148148148148
8307069,5,B001GT9DRK,This was the perfect gift for my girlfriend's birthday! The price was wonderful and the shipping was just fast enough to get here in time for me to wrap it up. I'd recommend this collection to any true eastern animation fans.,1363046400,,225,4.512195121951219
