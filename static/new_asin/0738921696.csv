7788277,2,0738921696,"I liked the content of the book. Story and illustrations are absolutely excellent, as indicated by other reviews.

However I had the misfortune of buying the Kindle version of the book. I viewed it on an iPad 3. The text is illegibly small, with lots of typos, and layout problems, such as text from some paragraphs overlapping text from other paragraphs. By squinting I was barely able to read the teeny, tiny text. There seemed to be no way to zoom in. When the book first launched, there was a seemingly-promising feature where you tap a paragraph and it zooms in. However, the expected way of using it (tap elsewhere to unzoom, tap on another paragraph to zoom in to it) didn't work. Thus, I got the first paragraph of the book zoomed in, and nothing else. The whole experience felt like somebody just copied and pasted the original document for the book into some conversion tool, which then did a bad job of converting it, and nobody bothered to check whether the end user experience would be acceptable.

Do buy the printed book. Avoid the Kindle version.",1346025600,,1062,4.6436170212765955
7788278,4,0738921696,"A teacher I worked with had the VHS movie of this strange version of Jack and the Beanstalk. She had a hard time finding the book at the local book stores so I surprised her with it from Amazon. The illustration is captivating to young children and is a great intro to the movie. Even if you don't have the movie, the book is fun to read and kids love it.",1294099200,,355,4.014084507042254
7788279,1,0738921696,"Fairy Tales and Fables Jack & the Beanstalk contains three short animated fairy tales: Jack and the Beanstalk, the Emporer's New Clothes, and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.  While this video follows the story of the fairy tales very closely, the animation is terrible, and whoever did the sound had a fetish for echo.  May be appropriate for young children when the baby-sitter is the only adult who has to listen to it.  Buy at your own risk.  There are much better versions out there.",1040947200,,487,4.627906976744186
7788280,2,0738921696,I thought the video should have portrayed the original storyline. It gets drawn out in parts and isn't suited for very young children (2-4 years). Some parts are pretty scary. I really didn't like the video and wouldn't recommend it.,1023753600,,233,4.85
7788281,4,0738921696,"Ok, so it starts out that Jack takes his cow to town, but the auctioneer gives him beans instead of coins and his Mom throws them outside. But the  next morning he gets up and decides they can sell all the beans on this  beanstalk...so he starts picking them and climbs to the top. He doesn't  meet the giant until there are about 30 minutes left in the movie because  he meets a girl whose harp was stolen and a donkey and they meet trolls and  vultures and peasants on their way to the castle. (All of them sing  songs...but the giant doesn't sing any which is a shame because he's  Tone-Loc.)Anyway, the giant gets electrocuted because he is chasing Jack  around with a fork and gets hit by lightning...well that's as far as I will  go or you will miss out. I think the ending was too abrupt though. Kids  will enjoy it!",966988800,3,823,4.285714285714286
7788282,5,0738921696,"When my five-year-old discovered Jack's tale at preschool, we ended up bringing home every version available at our local library.  Of course some were much better than others.  I soon decided that if I was going to be reading about Jack twelve times a day (my two-year-old by now had captured  his sister's passion for the tale), I needed to find the best written, most  readable version available.  Having long been a fan of Rabbit Ears Radio  and Rabit Ears Publishing, I did a little deeper search and found this  edition.  My recommendation?  Of the twenty or so Jacks we have read (and  read, and read. . . ) in the past few weeks, this is the one I purchased  for our family's collection.  I would highly recommend other books by this  publisher, as well.",956534400,9,762,4.555555555555555
