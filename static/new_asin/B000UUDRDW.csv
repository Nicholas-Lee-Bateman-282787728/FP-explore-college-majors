8496924,1,B000UUDRDW,"This is absoulely the worst attempt at sexy ""artsy"" low-budget film making I have ever seen---and I have seen a lot. What is probably meant to come across as a sexy amateur romp with naked guys actually comes across as an acting class production from the local methadone clinic. There was not one guy that I even wanted to see naked, but against better judgement, they do take off their clothes. UGH! I have to admit I only made it half-way through this film, I just couldn't finish watching it. It made feel like a dirty old man and just plain dirty. There are plenty of much better soft-core male nudity videos to spend your money on. For your own sake, please avoid.",1218931200,,669,4.4471544715447155
8496925,1,B000UUDRDW,"While ""Naked Producers"" sounded somewhat intriguing, I can't recommend this title to even the most devoted collector of lightweight videos featuring male nudity.  A bunch of dudes show up at a Baptist church (what?!) hoping to wear togas (I'm sure they only had one toga for everybody to share) and be cast in a Shakespearian production.  Each guy was filmed separately for the video, after which the footage was choppily spliced together as though they are actually interacting with one another.  While the guys are attractive and seem to be having fun with the ridiculous storyline, this is just too bizarre to be entertaining.

It's one thing to make a ""silly"" feature with a bunch of guys taking off their clothes for the camera.  Campfire Video churned out tons of videos back in the 90's doing exactly that, with decent results (like their ""America's Hunkiest Home Videos"" series, now available as ""Guys Next Door"").  But this production attempts to get a little too artsy (even ""deep"" at times!), and doesn't come close to pulling it off.  Why is the creepy director and/or producer playing ""Scrabble""?  What's up with the fiery explosions (really lame visual effects)?  Why does the wardrobe guy keep sniffing the toga?  Who is the bearded ""older"" actor bathed in green lighting (who supposedly played Dracula and various James Dean-type roles?) and why are his privates covered up in his one full-frontal shot?  And the real question is...why did I buy this dvd?

Needless to say, the dvd has no extras (a ""making of"" featurette might've proven to be enlightening and mildly entertaining).

If you want to make a video with some young dudes showing off their stuff as they repeatedly lift up their togas, that's fine.  Just don't try to pass it off as anything more than that.  Who knows, ""Naked Producers"" might be considered a campy classic years from now...but I REALLY doubt it.",1215302400,4,1891,4.90251572327044
