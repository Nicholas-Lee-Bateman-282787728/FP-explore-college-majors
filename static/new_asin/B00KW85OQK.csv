6452156,5,B00KW85OQK,"If you own any seasons of the Murdoch Mysteries series you already own some of this. You may want to check other purchase options to avoid duplication. If you are new to Murdoch Mysteries, this is a bundled beginning. All that have been release from season 1-6. Really good shows, border on classic.
I LOVE THIS SERIES.
One of the best period series going. I already own them all, but in Oct, 2014, Series 7 will release. You don't have to see them all in order, but once you've seen one season, you will want to see them all.

It's about a Toronto detective, late 1890's who manages to use inventive forensic modes now common in today's crime solving. Historic content of the show is as good as period sets and costuming. Historical personalities occasionally cross paths with Murdoch (Yannick Bisson). Novel adaptations of Maureen Jennings' writing. Always intriguing, always satisfying to the eyes and mind. An intellectual, entertaining, and sprinkled with bits of Victorian romance. Humor throughout, the series has it all.
Crabtree (Jonny Harris), Brackenreid (Thomas Craig), beautiful romantic Dr. Ogden (Helene Joy), & Higgins (Lachlan Murdoch).

SDH SUBTITLES on all 78 episodes. Many guest stars, and perhaps the most unique period cop show ever produced.
If all those episodes are not enough there is another Murdoch Mysteries Movie Collection with 3 feature length episodes.",1408320000,24,1386,5.101321585903084
6452157,5,B00KW85OQK,"The Murdoch Mysteries, Season 1-7 Are By Far The Best Series On Television. It Is A Real Shame That It Is Not Available In The USA, Except In Reruns On Ovation TV (Not Part Of Regular Cable Packages). Once You Start Watching (Should Start With Season 1) You Will be Hooked.",1408233600,10,273,4.372549019607843
6452158,5,B00KW85OQK,"Love the series.  Others have described the series in their reviews.  It's sort of a prequel to CSI and (maybe) Dragnet, all rolled into one with a nice dose of humor to wash it down.",1423440000,,183,4.2
6452159,5,B00KW85OQK,"Best show that I have ever seen in my life!  If you love mysteries, you will love this show!  The cast is perfect together, and the stories are fabulous!  I can not wait for season 8 to come out on dvd!  A+++ show!!!",1421539200,2,216,3.953488372093023
6452160,5,B00KW85OQK,"This is a terrific show. The first time I saw it, I found myself loving the characters. I was drawn by the period of time it takes place in, late 1800's. Some of the historical people it introduces are Thomas Edison, Buffalo Bill, and a man who thinks he's Sherlock Holmes. It also brings into play such inventions as finger ""marks"", and other crime solving technology. Julia is beautiful and smart and a perfect match for Murdoch. George is serious, but silly. He believes in ghosts and aliens and provides the comical side of the show. And Murdoch is smart and handsome, and deeply cares about his friends and his job. I love that he makes the sign of the cross  when when people die. Great show that leaves you wanting more. Highly recommended.",1421452800,4,747,4.574626865671642
6452161,5,B00KW85OQK,Even better than I expected.,1421366400,2,28,4.8
6452162,5,B00KW85OQK,Murdoch is such a handsome man.  I was disappointed that they never got married.  That was a bitter let down.,1420761600,2,109,4.4

6452165,4,B00KW85OQK,"I very much enjoy this series,  about 1/2 way through the available shows.  It is produced in Canada not by BBC.  Similarly presented shows might be Da Vincis Inquest, Cold Squad,  Ellery Queen,  and especially the Granada series of Sherlock Holmes,  also a period piece.
Murdoch Mysteries is a good period piece,  people rode horses & bicycles,  very few motorized vehicles.  The background can be charming and sweet,  it also can be broguish at times.  'Sherlock-Light' might best describe it.

I've updated my original review which was- Not like the BBC stuff I also ordered,  it's just ok,  so far I've not gotten too far into the series.",1419206400,,642,4.824074074074074
6452166,5,B00KW85OQK,"One of the best series on television.  It is so sad we don't get to see it weekly except in reruns on the Ovation cable station (and they are a year behind).  I would recommend this series highly.  The actors are great, the writing is just superb and the show has great depth.  Also I love the fact they use a lot of famous people from the past like Thomas Edison, WC Fields, Houdini and a bunch of others before they made their mark in history.  All this together makes a wonderful hour of entertainment.  The show is next to none.  If you are looking for a great series, this is it.",1418774400,,584,4.160714285714286

6452170,5,B00KW85OQK,"I recently got an Amazon Fire TV and Netflix has the first 3 seasons available which I'm eternally grateful for. I have become so hooked on this series I bought all through season 7 on DVD and will be passing on to relatives. I have become so involved with the characters and the continuing story lines I'll be very sad when I've finished all. We couldn't ask for a better actor than Yannick Bisson, to portray Murdock; ( the pompous, know it all, inventor genius who has a very hard time showing or admitting his feelings but he's SO endearing and exceptional as a Detective!)  I really enjoy all of the characters. Thomas Craig as the hot tempered Inspector and Jonny Harris as the very helpful imaginative Constable.
These are gritty shows and can be very graphic when it comes to the dead bodies, subject matter and autopsies but I've sure learned a lot about different scientific and other historical facts . Fascinating! They are in the midst of the 8th season right now but no telling if it will go beyond.
The only negative comment I have is that 'Acorn' who releases these DVD's does not include a list of what the episodes are about. I for one like to know. I was able to print from Wikipedia which helped. I will definitely be getting the 8th season when available.

Additional 11/10/14; In the 6th season there is a description of episode before playing.",1415404800,8,1366,4.571428571428571

Highly recommend this show if you've never seen it.  You won't be disappointed if you like historical crime drama.",1410566400,2,256,4.906976744186046
6452187,5,B00KW85OQK,"As a scientist with a love of history and an appreciation for excellent acting, I enjoy watching these shows over and over. Murdoch's inventiveness and the patter of one-liners are hilarious. Bisson plays the shy, often conflicted but strongly moral Victorian man beautifully. Julia's character provides lots of reasons for that conflict. Murdoch's morality would not be apparent without her. ""I brought dominos"" is one of the funniest lines in television history.

A note on the single ""1"" rating on this series: As a born-again Christian, I don't find exploration of the same themes that the Bible emphasizes at all shocking, especially when it is done well.",1410480000,10,660,5.168224299065421

6452192,1,B00KW85OQK,"I give this season one star because Julia Ogden is back.  She was mostly absent from Season 5, which was a great improvement.  Although most viewers just love Julia, I take great exception to the ""love story"" because she has done nothing except tear down William Murdoch's morals from the start of the series.  (I am very disappointed to know that even Yannick Bisson likes that element about this series.)  I am not Catholic.  In fact, as a Christian who is Baptist, I can easily pick apart Catholic doctrine, but the issue here is my utter disdain for the character of Julia Ogden.  In one of the early episodes of this season (and I've only seen 3 or 4 so far), she states emphatically, ""Damn God.""  She is no longer tearing down Murdoch or the church but instead is striking out at the God of Heaven, Helene Joy's Creator who wants to be her Savior from sin.  Also, I am disappointed that the writers of this very popular series felt the need to include nudity--for what reason?  To boost ratings?  This act just proves that greed can never be satisfied.  If I could return this series and get my money back for this Amazon ""lightning deal"" for Volumes 1-6, I would happily do so.",1410134400,,1184,4.485981308411215
6452193,5,B00KW85OQK,"Good, solid writing throughout the series with splendid acting and twists.  Just the right amount of fun --- and some episodes where the circumstances remind viewers that human errors and faults repeat themselves.  Worth watching --- it will keep you interested.",1410048000,4,262,5.365853658536586

6452195,4,B00KW85OQK,"The series is like a cross of SVU, BONES, AND SHERLOCK HOLMES.
You have to keep in mind that the series takes place in the late 1890's
so it's humorous with  some of the techniques and verbiage used.",1409961600,4,199,4.2368421052631575
6452196,5,B00KW85OQK,Murdoch Mysteries is one of my favorite shows.  Love the dvd's.  I only wish they had more outtakes an more behind the scenes features.,1409788800,,135,4.583333333333333

Had no idea what it was but our thought is that if we don't like something we can very easily delete it.  Well, believe me there has been no deleting til the show is over - my husband and I are both HOOKED!!!  We have the DVR set to record ""new and reruns"" because we do not know where we are in the series.  We will watch any of the shows in any order which is crazy since my husband sure won't do this with any other show.  Truly one of the BEST shows on tv, so good that we have decided to buy the whole run.",1458691200,,615,3.7364341085271318
