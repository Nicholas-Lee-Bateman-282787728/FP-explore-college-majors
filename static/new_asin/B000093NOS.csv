Sakura Wars is a very well put together TV series, one that combines the adventure of fighting demon attacks in Tokyo with the complex personal lives and interactions of the people who do the fighting.

Except for their commander, Ohgami, the flower troop are all young women, and all very different in personality and background.  Sakura, who comes from a lineage of spiritual warriors, is the title star  While the story revolves around her, it doesn't expend its entire focus on the young swordswoman.  Sakura represents Japanese tradition come to the city and meeting modern life head on.  Her struggle on this DVD is to bond with her koubu, the giant mechanical armor that she wears in their fight with the demon.  But what is really important isn't the girl in the suit, but how her relationships with the rest of the team begin to build.

The first new member is Kouran, one of the technical wizards behind the koubu.  Very much a geek, she helps Sakura overcome her discomfort with what she sees as a mechanical robot.  Then Kanna arrives, a karate expert.  She is an Okinawan (for some reason the Japanese think of Okinawans the way we do Georgia crackers) whose blunt and open attitude reveals a warm heart.  Her cooking and folksy ways helps the troop weld themselves into a close unit, and her muscle gives them needed power..

Sumire, the irritating actress, also unbends a bit, when a shift in fortune makes her realize that the other girls could be genuine friends.  Normally she mocks Sakura's awkwardness, but she suddenly reaches out past her pride.  And we also get to see a bit of Maria's story as a Russian revolutionary.  She and Sakura become an unlikely team as they race to rescue Ohgami from the demon boy Setsuma.

Just as characterization gives these episodes their depth, the story line binds everything together.  The demons give the series purpose and provide the dark mystery that lies behind this steam gothic version of Japan.  The childlike Setsuna and his giant friend Rasetsu are chilling opponents, and we are given glimpses of other dangerous characters that lurk in the shadows.

So rather than not like this series, I find that it is exceptionally enjoyable.  If you haven't had a change to make its acquaintance I can only say that this is one of the modern classics of Japanese anime, and is well worth viewing.",1137110400,,2478,4.740654205607477
