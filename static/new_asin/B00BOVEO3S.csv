5662940,5,B00BOVEO3S,"A very well produced DVD of the WWII museum in Natick, MA. It contains much historical commentary and vintage footage, as well as detailing the museum and its artifacts, all original items.  A tribute to those who served!  Highly recommend this even if you can't get to the museum.",1437609600,,281,4.714285714285714

8571965,5,B00BOVEO3S,"Did not present any information that was new to me. However, presented a feeling about how the war must have felt to people of that time in a very vivid and effective manner. History from the top down is useful and necessary. This is from the bottom up and sheds light into the life of participants. War sucks and it is sometimes easy to ignore how it affects real people.",1481760000,,372,4.328571428571428

8571970,2,B00BOVEO3S,"Kudos to the producers for getting someone as accomplished as Dan Akroyd to narrate this program (did the producers have clandestine pictures/video of Akroyd doing illegal acts on small, furry animals?) One wonders.

The subject matter is fascinating to me but it's pretty much a 90-minute ad for this private WWII museum. It watched like a guided tour with close-ups on some of the artifacts.

If you do not live in Western Massachusetts or are in driving range, save yourself some gas money and watch this ad, ahem, err, documentary.",1456617600,2,535,4.933333333333334
