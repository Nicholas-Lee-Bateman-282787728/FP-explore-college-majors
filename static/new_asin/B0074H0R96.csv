5054106,5,B0074H0R96,"I gave a five star, because I thought it was perfect. Thank God some people back then thought to video tape this concert. Watching this concert made me feel I was back in 1975. If you are a Thin Lizzy fan, you need this in your dvd collection.",1363478400,,243,4.083333333333333
5054107,4,B0074H0R96,"I enjoyed seeing Thin Lizzy before they hit it big. 1975 before the Jailbreak success. The video of the 1975 concert suffers a bit by having their heads cut off a bit here and there. But if you can get past that this DVD is a good buy. I wish that this could of been released in 5.1 that would of been the icing on the cake. I haven't reviewed the rest of the special features yet. The only thing that I really cared about buying was the 1975 concert. Although the video has it's flaws, it's still a better than average pick up. Seeing Thin Lizzy in their early form is a real treat.",1345248000,2,583,4.078260869565217
5054108,1,B0074H0R96,"This would have been an amazing DVD if the original aspect ratio had been preserved. The main feature is a stunning performance by the band in 1975 and all the extras are interesting and worth having. But everything was ruined by the geniuses responsible for this release who chose to adapt it to ""current standards"" by cropping off the top and bottom of the picture to come up with a widescreen (16:9) version of footage that was originally shot in full (4:3) screen. Just so you can fill your widescreen TV with image, without having to ""tolerate"" those vertical black bars. By doing so, they ended up robbing us of a third of the footage that what was originally shot/broadcasted.  What they accomplished with this inexcusable butchering was not only cutting off Phil's `fro from every shot but also much of Robbo's and Scott's picking and fretboard skills. Unbelievable! The framing looks so wrong and out of proportion the whole time it's just ridiculous. Fake widescreen is always a stupid decision. Will they ever learn?",1342224000,35,1027,4.868571428571428
5054109,4,B0074H0R96,This was not at a stadium. It was at a night club. The Phil lynott documentary was great. Some of the films were on other DVDs. For example the Boys are Back in Town was from the Live and Dangerous DVD. If you are a Lizzy fan it is essential for your collection.,1341100800,,262,3.9622641509433962
5054110,5,B0074H0R96,"This is worth every penny. This is right up there with ""Live and Dangerous"" performance wise. Filmed on their ""Fighting Tour"" this is The Hey Day line up in it's early years. With Jailbreak not being out until later in the year you don't get the hits most people know but the band had found it's feet and the show is tight and energy driven. Besides the '75 concert you get ""Renegade"" a documentary on Phil and Thin Lizzy. You also get a half hour TV show on the ""Farewell Tour"" that thankfully was stil years off after the '75 show. As a bonus you get a couple of live TV appearances and they are live. No Top Of The Pops here. Over all could not be happier with this collection.
In closing I ordered mine from Amazon UK at a beter Price then .ca. It also came before .ca has even got stock and even thow it said PAL for format on their site (UK) the copy I received was NTSC. Amazon doesn't make it easy.",1335139200,,906,4.124293785310734
5054111,5,B0074H0R96,"I've had all this stuff for years on video and I have 3 versions of this show
and most were horrible but the last one was pretty good. I like this cause
now it has all the bonus stuff together so I will get it for my collection.
The show is great from Dublin TV show LIVE! This is Thin Lizzy Fighting
Tour before Jailbreak which was their biggest selling album! It shows some
kinks in their show but that's what LIVE is no fake vocals lip synching here!
The power of the band ready to burst out as you can hear on the rocking numbers!
You get The Rocker!!! which is not included on live and dangerous dvd! Brian
Downey is the most underrated drummer in rock and his solo is a monster! You
get early Lizzy classics also! The bonus stuff is worth the price also if
you never saw it! I love the documentary stuff it's awesome! Thin Lizzy a
true rock legend that doesn't get the attention and credit in the US!",1334275200,5,906,4.153409090909091
5054112,5,B0074H0R96,"The full 1975 show in Dublin! If you're a huge Lizzy fan like me, you've seen the shoddy quality clips of the few songs from the '75 that were previously out there from whoever taped them back in the 70's, but now we have the full gig beautifully remastered and restored.

Not only do you get the full '75 gig for a mere 8.99 on amazon uk or 20 bucks here, you get a wide array of extras. The Sun Goes Down Documentary covers the farewell tour, the lighting and all of that stuff, and you get songs within the doc itself. Are You Ready from Belfast 1983 and The Sun Goes Down from Dublin 1983 which we've all seen before. I have this documentary transferred from an old VHS on my computer from when it aired, and it doesn't feature Are You Ready and Cowboy Song, so think of this as an even bigger bonus.

1. Are You Ready?
2. Cowboy Song
3. Baby Please Don't Go
4. The Sun Goes Down

You also get Renegade: The Phil Lynott Story, which covers Phil Lynott's life up until the Renegade album. It's a sort of sitdown interview and it integrates live performances from his solo tour, music videos, and live Lizzy. here is what's integrated. Most are not full videos though of course.

 A treat to watch, and on top of that, you have even more bonuses to add to the bonuses! Finally, a fully restored version of the Old Town music video from Phil's solo second solo album! Are You Ready and Whisky In The Jar live in 1980 on a music show, 6/5 Live. Pick this up at once. It's worth the listed price and more.",1333929600,22,1946,4.075916230366492
5054113,5,B0074H0R96,"I received this today from Amazon UK can only say it is stunning. The video and audio is fantastic for such an old concert.
This show has been circulating in bootleg collector circles for a while now  but in no where near this quality.  The video is  clean and crisp with vibrant colors and the remastered audio clear full and well balanced.

The extras are also well done with some great interview footage with Phil.

The only thing more I could have wished for would have been an audio cd as part of the package but nitpicking aside this is a must have.",1332115200,3,555,4.349514563106796

8509911,5,B0074H0R96,"The DVD is chock filled with Thin Lizzy/ Phil Lynott goodness! The '75 concert is  a pro shot, remastered in stereo, up close, personal & intimate show that you will watch over and over! Then there is the documentary, ""Renegade: The Phil Lynott Story that was don't prior to his passing. It is so nice to have a documentary with Phil speaking for himself. With great clips included!
THEN, ""The Sun Goes Down: Farewell Irish Tour"" Concert/documentary. A ""Fly On The Wall"" concert and documentary with clips I have seen but never the original source!

Then, there is bonus material! 2 live TV performances of ""Are You Ready"" and ""Whiskey In The Jar"". Plus finally, for the first time anywhere, the actual prom video for ""Old Town"" from ""The Philip Lynott Album. Looking like it is from the master reel and is full stereo! One I have been looking for for decades!

Don't think twice, order it whhile you still can! This is no bootleg, it is put out by ""Universal"". Best DVD I have of Phil and the boys!",1391558400,2,999,4.538888888888889
8509912,4,B0074H0R96,"If you aren't a Thin Lizzy fan then you probably aren't going to buy this, anyway.  If YOU ARE a real fan, then you will definitely appreciate having this disc.  I mean, there just are not a lot of live, video performances for us fans to choose from and I believe I have them all.  Having said that, ""Live & Dangerous"" and now this compilation are the only two DVD collections worth owning, really.  All the other DVD offerings that I've heard/seen, suffer from either inferior sound and/or video quality.

By comparison, this is a cleaner picture and a much better performance than the ""Rockpalast"" DVD.  The negative reviews/critiques of ""National Stadium"" seem a bit harsh to me, considering the source material.  Sure, it isn't ""The Song Remains The Same"" but I guess they just didn't have the resources of Led Zepplin at the time, ya know?  Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I'd rather have this, than nothing.  Plus, I would have been 5 years old and I don't live anywhere near Ireland, so I doubt I would have been able to see this or any other performance from that era.

I only have two negative critisims here and that is:  1) I wish there had been two full sets here, instead of one.  (But the one is really good and has several songs not available in any other collection.)  2) Sound Quality:  The bass guitar is not loud or defined enough and the treble tones (guitars) are pretty darn edgy.  I can only hope that the folks who mixed/mastered this, did the best they could with what they had.  Still, it is worth it for the performance and the 'time capsule' factor.

On a positive note, Phil's singing never sounded better.  In fact, I've never heard the man sing an 'off-note' in any live performance.  Beyond that, there are some nice, previously unreleased extras def worth having, as listed in the description.",1375142400,3,1822,4.60248447204969
8509913,5,B0074H0R96,"I just wish Scott Gorham was not so prominent in the stage stuff, he looked too period...Lizzy should be eternal",1369267200,,112,4.65
8509914,5,B0074H0R96,Two words - must have! This  DVD has footage we have never seen before and gave a new look to the man and band we have listen to for years!,1364947200,,139,3.6333333333333333
