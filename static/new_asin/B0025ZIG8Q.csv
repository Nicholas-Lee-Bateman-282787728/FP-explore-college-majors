8351499,5,B0025ZIG8Q,"This BBC production captures very well the spirit of George Orwell's book ""1984"". If you like the version with Richard Burton and John Hurt (an MGM production), which is very good, then the BBC production is a very good complement to it. For example the BBC production shows buildings such as the Ministry of Love but I do not recall seeing such buildings in the MGM production. The BBC production seems possibly more stark and brutal then the MGM production. This may be partly because it is in black and white rather than in colour.",1488412800,5,534,4.631578947368421
8351500,5,B0025ZIG8Q,"1984 is a classic story.  I loved the book, and I enjoyed this version.  i remember first seeing it as a kid, and thought things like that could never happen...",1363219200,,160,4.3
8351501,2,B0025ZIG8Q,"Fantastic version with Peter Cushing, but visual quality of both productions are sub-par.  At times the images are so grainy, you can't even make out what's happening.

If your interest can overlook this, it may be worth the price, but I liken viewing these productions like watching the narrative through the knothole of a wooden fence--you constantly feel as if you're missing a large part of the story.",1290902400,7,405,4.9411764705882355
8351502,3,B0025ZIG8Q,"First to clarify: this is not the version of George Orwell's novel in which John Hurt and Richard Burton starred.  This set contains two DVDs of much earlier productions of Orwell's famous story.  There is a 1956 movie, and a 1954 British BBC TV drama.  These are both worth seeing; just know what you are getting.  The quality of the transfer is not particularly good on either disk--these productions are both black and white, and look like they were sitting in an archive somewhere for the past 60 years.

But both are worth the price of admission.  Orwell had a brilliant and fearful vision of what our world might have been and might still become.  Every educated person should read Orwell's book and understand its message.  These films, imperfect as they are, are nonetheless quite good vehicles towards this end, and entertaining to boot.",1249776000,31,846,4.826388888888889
8351503,2,B0025ZIG8Q,"1984 is a tough one to find, and the claim that this is a ""remastered"" edition is simply false.  Video quality is in the tank, and the sound brings back nightmares of two tin cans and a length of string.  My best assessment is that this is a VHS or beta dub onto DVD and the quality shows for that...  If you're looking for a solid copy of this film, keep searching, my friends.  I had to pay a bit extra to find a worthwhile of the actual film, but it was well worth the duckets...",1247529600,15,482,3.9895833333333335
8351504,5,B0025ZIG8Q,"Probably one of the best renditions of the story based on a book ""1984"" written by George Orwell.

Basic story:
In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.  He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.
If he gets caught, he will be sent to the ""Ministry of Love"" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity.  They will even forgive his past indiscretions.

Peter Cushing, a veteran actor, plays Winston smith. The film is in black and white. There are clips of this film in other 1984 documentaries. Copies are hard to find. With any luck, this fill will show-up on a Criterion DVD.
