5111399,5,B007V9ECZC,"They're baaaaack~!!!  All of your favourite Hetalia characters in one big joy of a party!  As we've had new characters in the first part of World Series, we've got some more on the way~!  We'z got Seychelles(for about 5 secounds >_>)and The Netherlands along with Belgium~!

Season 4 is exactly what we left off with in season 3, so nothing too normal is gonna be introduced in this season.  Just a lot of craziness and fun times with the boys!  And gals^^
But I will say that instead of Prussia's awesomeness taking over the screen---WE'RE GONNA BE INVADED BY ADORABLE SHORTA SEA-KUN!!!!  EVERYONE RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!  SEALAND WANTS TO BE A COUNTRY!!!!  AND HE'LL STOP AT NOTHING IN ORDER TO GET IT!!!
...C'mon, he's even invaded Ebay already~!  Who can compete with that?XD

So what're you guys waiting for?  Hurry up and get this season before Sea-kun takes over! (Not that I have a problem with that)",1336867200,5,907,4.670886075949367
5111400,5,B007V9ECZC,"ok i know that the this isn't offically oiut yet, but i watch this online subbed. It's just as good if not better than the rest of the season. SO if your an hetalia fan go for it. Most of the episodes pick up right where they left off too! Like Boss spain and chibe romano :)",1336521600,10,275,3.8421052631578947
5111401,5,B007V9ECZC,"So, I'm starting off with a ""yay!""
Hetalia is my number anime and I just could not believe that my mother gave this for my
birthday. The DVD box was a little bit damaged because of shipping; maybe they throw
the box around or something XD The episodes were amazing! The designs and everything
were worth a penny! I even got a yellow bandana that was inside the box. I highly recommend
this for the Hetalia fans!!",1366934400,,412,4.363636363636363

5111403,5,B007V9ECZC,"The series as a whole was something unexpectedly delightful for the price of admission. I picked it up a few years ago due to my girlfriend's interest in it and its become one of my all time favorite sense. Though this season was a bit lacking, it still was one of the funniest anime I've seen in ages.",1362096000,,302,4.224137931034483
5111404,5,B007V9ECZC,My teens are obsessed with Hetalia & Todd Haberkorn.  Any Hetalia is better than no Hetalia in their minds.  This was a great addition to their collection.,1360368000,,155,4.703703703703703
5111405,5,B007V9ECZC,"One of the best seasons so far, very, very funny!

Very funny and if you're a hetalia fan, buy this.",1355270400,,281,4.423076923076923

5111410,5,B007V9ECZC,"Alright let's get this out of the way:  This season was a big time improvement over the first season of ""World Series"". (See my review of season three to see my criticisms of it)

This season contained the second half of World Series and introduces some characters that you might not have seen before like Seychelles, The Netherlands and Belgium.  Incidentally Belgium and Sey(that's what I call her because I seriously can't pronounce her name) come towards the end of the series so you almost know for a fact at this point that the hand was tipped that there would be (and is going to be) a 5th season.  You generally DON'T introduce new characters into a series when its getting ready to wrap up so you already knew what was going to happen there.

""Nekotalia"" is one of the hidden gems in the season because it shows some of the countries (Germany, Italy, Romano, Russia, Japan and Austria) as felines and it actually makes for a very entertaining watch especially the final one where you have Austria and Germany's cat getting ready to go to a cat meeting and Austria still has signature ""Mariazell"" but its just too funny to see when he's a kitten.  Even funnier is when he's trying to bat down his furn and he hits his right ear constantly...quite amusing actually!

One minor issue I had with this series but it wasn't a total deal breaker was actually during one of the end credits and the sequence of certain episodes.

During the end credits of one episode during the season they showed a clip with Norway and Iceland.  The clip was actually from what has been called on Youtube as ""Extra Episode 1"" when Iceland finds out that Norway is his brother.  The issue here is that the episode DIDN'T happen yet so it was kind of confusing as to why they would show a clip from that episode.  You don't hear the audio but you see a brief glimpse of the scene which tells you the episode is probably on the disc.

The episode sequence issue comes with the final ""extra episode"" of Hetalia and it deals with Hungary and Prussia as kids.  In that episode is when we have the hilarious deal about if Hungary is a girl or not and when she tells Prussia her ""secret"" he kind of looks surprised and all that.  The thing about it is that during the ""crotch cloth caper"" which happens during the ""regular episodes"" the clip when Prussia shows his shock from Hungary in the extra episode is revealed.  The only reason you have to watch the episode is to find out what the heck happened.

Other than those minor issues I strongly recommend this season.  Its gonna tide you over until ""Beautiful World"" and I honestly can't wait.  I hope when we get to see it its just as AWESOME as Prussia is :)

5/5 and like FUNI's motto:

you SHOULD be watching!",1351728000,2,2741,4.454909819639279
5111411,5,B007V9ECZC,"This is halariously addicting. My friend and I watched all of it as soon as I got it. We literally spent ALL night watching every season, leading to this season. It was worth the wait, and it is just halarious. After it, we had a ""hetalia hangover"" where our brains were in hetalia mode hours after we finished watching the season. Wouldn't have it any other way.

5111412,5,B007V9ECZC,"Came in perfect condition, and it surprised me! I didn't realize that season four came with a bandana as well! Loved it~ Thank you!",1347148800,,131,4.5

i would buy more for my sister
if you like funny anime buy this dvd",1346889600,,102,3.4782608695652173
5111414,5,B007V9ECZC,My daughter was really happy with this series. I am glad I bought it for her so anyone that is a fan of Hetalia I recommend highly.,1345334400,,131,3.888888888888889
5111415,5,B007V9ECZC,"I live in New Zealand and I'm a huge otaku for anime. I love many different anime titles, Hetalia being among them, and I couldn't wait to get Season 4 to add to my collection. Trouble was when Season 4 came out, it hadn't even arrived in NZ yet and probably wouldn't for another few months or so. So I ordered the Limited Edition on Amazon.
I had never used amazon before so I was a little worried. I had a multi region DVD player but I still wondered if it would play region 1. Nevertheless the estimated arrival date for the DVD was August 22nd so I waited patiently.
To my surprise a week after I ordered the package had already arrived! It was packed well and in superb condition. The DVD played in my player, and it had everything advertised; the banner, the DVD etc etc. Thank you, Amazon, for the quick shipping and the great packaging!
Now onto the review of 'Hetalia' itself. Season 4 is one of the more crazier seasons, so you know you're in for a wild, hilarious ride. There's not much plot like its former seasons, its main purpose to make you laugh and offend the Italians! Haha, but really, Hetalia isn't for the faint of heart. If you're easily offended then you may take offense to Hetalia, which takes a bunch of countries and personifies them into people, all the while poking fun at typical country stereotypes. (Italy is a pasta-loving womanizer, Germany is blonde with blue eyes and has a stick up his ass, Japan is...Japan, France is a pervert, etc etc.) The show is a lot of politically incorrect fun, and as each episode is only five minutes long, it doesn't 'try' to be funny or anything like that; it's just naturally laugh-worthy.

Anyhow,
Packaging - ***** ((Five Stars - everything was there and in perfect order.))
Shipping - ***** ((Came quicker than it was supposed to, much to my delight.))
Anime - ***** ((Hetalia is a bit of politically incorrect nonsense for your enjoyment. It is, indeed, hilarious in its own quirky way.))

In the end,
10/10",1342656000,8,1980,4.527932960893855
5111416,5,B007V9ECZC,"I just got the package today and it's great. The extra CD has a compilation of Chibitalia and America's Storage Cleaning. They made it flow very well and cut out a lot of the unnecessary stuff. That made me very happy :). I find that this season is the best season yet. They go more into minor characters of Hetalia like Poland, Lithuania, Prussia, Hungary, and the Nordics. I love it!~ Of course it comes with the bandanna too which is very cute.",1341792000,6,447,4.397590361445783
5111417,5,B007V9ECZC,"This is an excellent dvd for any Hetalia fan. It has a lot of nice extras, not only is the ever fun out takes back as well as a lot of other nice extras. They even added the bonus episodes into the disk.
Funny and as irreverent as always, though not a series for those who are easily offended.",1341532800,,293,3.983050847457627

5111420,5,B007V9ECZC,"I was curious to know if they were going to include the episode with the nordics and what luck!

8522170,5,B007V9ECZC,"After first getting introduced to the world of Hetalia by a friend, I have enjoyed this series consistently. Each new season bringing a ton of laughter and joy, giving History a fun ""edge"". Each nation is stereotyped, but the way it's done makes it pleasing and joyous instead of offensive. The perfect way to get interested in History, but beware of the language, this is not something you want to expose the littles too unless you want them swearing.

and the cute, adorable bandana is a plus, in this limited edition, and I must say, if you haven't gotten it yet, do so now or forever rest in peace. :3",1422489600,,605,4.5
