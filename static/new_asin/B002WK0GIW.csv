8383193,5,B002WK0GIW,Surprising how much longer I am willing to stay on a stationary bike while watching these. The scenery is awesome! Simple concept that actually works!,1502064000,,150,5.04
8383194,4,B002WK0GIW,not of blu ray quality but much better than the non blu ray version great for making the workout time fly.,1385856000,,106,4.095238095238095
8383195,5,B002WK0GIW,Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVD Arches and Capitol Reef National Parks. This cycling video is wonderful and I never am bored with the scenery. The landscapes are dramatic and exactly what you would imagine cycling through the Old West would be like. The clarity of the video is excellent and the length is longer than I expected at 90 minutes so a lot more workout for the money. You cycle through two National Parks in Utah and many dramatic scenes of red rock formations contrasting with the bright blue skies. I recommend this and the Zion National Parks video by Bike-O-Vision if you love the incredible Out West scenery.,1346025600,,619,4.794392523364486
