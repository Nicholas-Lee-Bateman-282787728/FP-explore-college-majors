8326151,2,B0016WHIAG,"The presenter of this series has a very heavy accent and at times is hard to follow.  In fairness he acknowledges this in the video, but that does not help with the problem. Over all this just does not come across as a very professional production.  I don't need, or want to see the presenter of the video in just about every part  of the movie. The scene transitions are of amateur quality as is the music.  This is a shame because over all the content of the course from a technical standpoint  is good and If you can deal with the poor production quality,  you can learn from the content.",1306022400,2,591,4.2792792792792795
