4154477,4,B003M8NGPS,"More detailed than I expected, Much of the first DVD covers each season pretty thoroughly, Two hours through the (glory years) of the franchise, (More thoroughly than I care to remember). Much vintage film from the sixties era. Most I had never seen before. And in detail the great Tarkenton led teams. Speeds up a little through the Burns, Green, Modern era. But is up to date to last season's NFC title appearance. The second DVD is modern NFL NETWORK fodder, Would rather they would have included the four official Super Bowl films with John Facenda narration,,(Yeah! I'm a glutton for punishment). For a Viking fan it's a must have.",1292889600,,636,4.790909090909091
4154478,5,B003M8NGPS,"This is the best dvd for real, dyed-in-the-purple Minnesota Vikings fans.  The disks include interviews, game highlights, and the history of the team.  A wonderful product for anyone who loves this team.",1290816000,,203,5.3125
4154479,5,B003M8NGPS,"Over the years, as a huge fan of the Minnesota Vikings, I have tried to pursue a lot of the old highlight reels, with varying success/failure.  Now, I have the one set that will stand in my collection as the definitive Vikings history on DVD.

There are two parts to this DVD:

First, is the roughly two-hour ""History of the Vikings"" documentary, which touches on nearly every season in the franchise's 50 year history.  It is very well done and will appeal to Vikings fans both young and old.

The second disc continues some shorter vignettes about Bud Grant, Adrian Peterson, Robert Smith, and the ""Missing Rings"" segments of the 1969 and 1998 Vikings.  Again, nothing here is boring.

So, if you have been searching high and low for Minnesota Vikings history, please look no further.  This set is inexpensive, yet expansive in history.  It will be the cornerstone of your Vikings collection, for sure.",1290729600,11,904,4.780645161290322
4154480,5,B003M8NGPS,"This dvd set is a must see for any Vikings fan, or for anyone who is interested in the history of the Minnesota Vikings.  As a fan for nearly fifty years, I am very pleased with this product.  Go Vikes!!!!!!!!!!",1288137600,,211,4.25

4154482,5,B003M8NGPS,"If you are a Viking fan this is a must! Loved watching the few hours of highlights from the Vikings over the past 50 years. My Best friends dad is even in this as he made a great interception for a TD against the Chicago Bears. All the great players Tarkenton, Gilliam, Sammy White, Marshal, Page, Foreman, Anthony Carter, Cris Carter on and on etc... How do you not love the Mexican/American player Joe Kapp after watching this DVD, what a cool guy! Kapp was given the most valuable player award and he refused to take it because he said it was all about the team not him! After watching this, you'll know why the owners wanted to bring back Randy Moss! Amazon.com by far, had the best price.",1287100800,7,693,4.37984496124031

4154484,5,B003M8NGPS,"This 2 disc set on the History of the Minnesota Vikings is great!  The first disc covers the franchise history in the NFL beginning in 1960 through 2010; covers mostly all of the past great Vikings teams and members, Joe Kapp, Fran Tarkenton, Chuck Foreman, Keith Millard, Wally Hilgenberg, Marshall, Page, Eller, Randall McDaniel, Adrian Peterson, Favre, the list goes on and on, great stuff!

The second disc is just as great with BOTH America's Games: Missing Rings - the 1968 Vikings and the 1998 Vikings, again, just great stuff!

This is a a must own for any Vikings fan and a definite complement to the 5 greatest games dvd set on the Minnesota Vikings!",1285027200,19,660,4.721739130434782

4154567,5,B003M8NGPS,"Excellent history of the Vikings, I especially enjoyed the two ""America's Game: Missing Rings"" episodes. It makes you realize just how good some of these Minnesota teams were that sadly came up short due to either bad luck (Gary Anderson's miss) or not being quite good enough (losing Super Bowl IV to KC).",1436486400,3,306,4.7924528301886795

4154573,5,B003M8NGPS,"I am not a Minnesota Viking fan and I absolutely loved it because it took me back to when football was violent (on the field instead of off the field). With all the crap going on today you need to buy this 2 DVD set. Everyone that I have loaned it to was blown away. Seattle Seahawk fans find out WHY Russell Wilson IS the second comming of Fran Tarkenton. And meet the most vicious defensive line ever, the purple people eaters. And finally how about a mexican quarterback who could not throw a spiral but has the record for most TD passes in a game. A qb with the mentality of a linebacker. Borderline psycho. Joe Kapp. It's kind of hard to throw a spiral WHEN YOU DON""T USE THE LACES! And this insane asylum was controlled by one of the calmest coaches ever, Hall of Famer Bud Grant!",1412208000,3,786,4.246666666666667

4154613,4,B003M8NGPS,"Does a great job of covering this history of the team from the very beginning.  You get to see footage of the team from 1961-1968 which I had never seen before.  It's pretty long, you pretty much have to watch it in two sittings.  The second disc was disappointing to me, as I had already watched the misisng rings on the NFL Network.  Excellent production, but I had already seen it.",1364774400,,384,4.366197183098592

4154626,5,B003M8NGPS,"Ready...set...hut!:  Rather than get a cumbersome book about the Minnesota Vikings, I bought this 2-DVD set and I am thrilled with the product!  The DVDs are quality and the content is terrific.  This will hold your interest throughout, as the greats from the past are seen once again.  My children are huge Vikings fans, and I wanted to put this in my collection so that they could see what I witnessed as I was growing up.  Love the parts on Bud Grant (my favorite coach of any sport), and the stories on the heroes of my youth.  Both DVD's are packed with Vikings players, teams, and coaches.  Highly recommended.  And best of all, it comes in an attractive case that easily fits into my storage cabinet (unlike a large book).  If you want to reexperience the great Vikings players and teams of the past, this is the product to purchase.  It is a sure touchdown!

If the Vikings haden't lost during the 1998 season, we would have rated this a 5 out of 5!  It made him depressed to go back to that time, but any Vikings fan knows that they do eventually break your heart when it comes to playoffs.  Overall a very good purchase!",1307491200,,355,4.0285714285714285
4154630,3,B003M8NGPS,"Yes, to paraphrase Viking great and ""That's Incredible"" cohost Fran Tarkenton this two DVD set is very very average. The quality of the stuff is great. The problem is, despite, a Complete History on Disc 1, Disc 2 is a rehash. Disc 2 has the two ""America's Game: Missing Rings"" episodes that most fans will have already seen on the NFL Network that cover the 1969 and 1998 seasons.

Given there is an NFL Films ""Purple Power Years"" that covers the four NFL/NFC Championship seasons where the Vikings went to four Super Bowls (and sadly lost all four), I'd prefer if the NFL is going to go into the vault, throw those on there in this collection.

I just felt they could have done as good a job as they did on the KC Chiefs one but they really fell back on those America's Games as filler. Nice filler if you have never seen those; not so much if you have.",1305849600,2,855,4.304347826086956

4154634,5,B003M8NGPS,"There is some terrific highlight footage of the early '60s Vikings games, color and black and white film that I never knew existed before.  This program delivers the goods, and leaves no era out of the chronicles.  Along with the game films, aged Vikings of yore were interviewed and were generous with their memories and insights.  Who'd have thought old Bud would have so much to say.  This DVD brought back a wealth of warm memories for me, and I wish I could buy a copy for all of my purple friends.",1293235200,,503,4.434782608695652
