The mix of songs is really good. Sunrise and Sweet Freedom are stand outs. Between 2 worlds packs a punch right from the start and sounds great. Bernies rendition of rain is just like the original, supurb. The sound, particularly the bass, is excellent and hard to believe it is live. The guys still harmonises really well and there is some excellent vocal work from Bernie with Lee doing an outstanding job of backing vocals and drums. Mick is his usual happy self all the way through, providing some great licks. The show moves along at a really good pace, doesn't slow down and leaves you wanting more.
Highly recommend it.",1186963200,4,783,4.4825174825174825

7935346,5,B00005ABVY,"I have been a Heep fan for years but never got to see them live in concert. Well, this is about as close as I can get for now. The DVD is great. The sound is excellent. I love this band. Mick & the boys are in fine form. I got mine through their on-line store so my copy was autographed by the band! It is a great retrospective of the band. A sort of 'history lesson' if you will. I also own the ""Live In Moscow"", ""Acoustically Driven"" & ""Electrically Driven"" DVDs, which are all great too. So grab these discs while you can. This band ROCKS!!!!",1010016000,12,545,4.055555555555555
7935347,5,B00005ABVY,"Being primarily a fan of the 70's Uriah Heep, I was somewhat sceptical towards this DVD. I thought it would be nothing more than a bunch of old farts trying to milk some extra retirement money out of a once glorious band. I couldn't have been more wrong...
Uriah Heep today is alive, vibrant and ready to kick some serious ....! The guys are really enjoying themselves on stage, and their emotions are brilliantly displayed through their music. These guys are real professionals and it's awesome to see them play. Buy this DVD and be surprised!",1003190400,11,544,4.677083333333333
