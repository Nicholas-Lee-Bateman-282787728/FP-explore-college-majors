3067667,5,B0011QC9OW,"The Crave films series is a wonderful dvd and belongs in every believer's collection. In the first story, a man who escapes from prison comes to a family's home and the drama that ensues is enough to make you want to cry! I almost did!
The second story is about a pop star who shares a hospital room w/ a little girl and forms a bond that pushes the man to a drastic but heart warming sacrifice.
The third story isn't as good as the others in my opinion, but it involves friendship that couldn't have come at a better time. Overall, this dvd was worth buying in my opinion, although the third story was weak and something that I didn't care to watch again. I would still give this dvd 4 stars out of 5 b/c the previous stories were so good and left me w/ a feeling of peace. Get this this dvd now!
Oh and btw: These films are truly short films. They are only about 10 mins. each, so if you're looking for 30 min. films, you will be disappointed.",1212796800,4,945,4.141304347826087

8242081,4,B0011QC9OW,"I liked this series because it showed stories that you can relate to.
Inspiring and encouraging!
I recommend it for home/bible groups who want to increase their faith.",1377216000,,167,5.0
8242082,3,B0011QC9OW,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I purchased this.  It is different.  It is not a movie.  It's a documentary type film that covers stories of others lives in short story form, (hence the series).  It gets its point across.  It's got a good message.  I did like it okay.  I wouldn't want to watch it again though.",1353715200,2,319,4.216666666666667
8242083,5,B0011QC9OW,"Excellent video series.  Part of a growing volume of resources available from Power to Change, Crave, and Mosaic LA",1296432000,,115,5.052631578947368
8242084,1,B0011QC9OW,"The preview looks much more interesting and original than the stories actually are. While all the stories had potential to go interesting places, each was over in what felt like about three minutes. They weren't even digitally remastered (the preview was). While I found it interesting, I don't see it provoking much conversation in Bible groups, and the pastor's filmed introductions were just boring and redundant.

C'mon, Christian film industry! I still believe in you! Try harder!",1264032000,2,485,5.298701298701299
8242085,2,B0011QC9OW,"Perhaps Crave has some nice moments, but it is too Middle of the Road to be gripping television.",1260403200,2,96,4.388888888888889
8242086,5,B0011QC9OW,"I wondered what I might get when I ordered this. But the films are of exceptional quality, and the whole disk is a nice product. As with their ""Wide Awake"" DVD, the menu system requires constant clicking to access each video, but it's endurable. Productions are top notch!",1239148800,,272,4.6875
8242087,4,B0011QC9OW,"This DVD is a collection of three short films based on stories from McManus. The films are only about 10 minutes each. The three films were interesting, but I enjoyed him speaking before and after each one more. The theme of the 3 films are things that we crave in this life: Destiny, Intimacy, and Meaning. This dvd is faith based, but at the same time is very down to earth and easy to relate to. It only takes about 45 minutes to watch the entire disc, but it was definitely enjoyable and insightful.",1215216000,5,503,4.361702127659575
