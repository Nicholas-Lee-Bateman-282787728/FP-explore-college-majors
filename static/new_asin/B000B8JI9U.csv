2408674,5,B000B8JI9U,"i've taken lessons from a dozen pros some for years on weekly basis. There were immediate results from them all. However as the weeks and months went on i'd hit a wall which would all but stop any forward progression. It's because, from week to week the lessons would change from one fault correction to another. The long and short of it is that after a while, what one has is a collection of band aids or quick fixes from the many lessons. Once looking at AJ's DVDs and the information masterfully imparted by him, it was as the tittle says. i found the truth! i 've commited to this TRUTH wholeheartedly for the last 2+ months and it just keeps getting  more natural and consistent with every  practice. Golf is an intelligent game played by intelligent  people stupidly. This means that you've got to PRACTICE to get better. But practice with a purpose and with the right technique.  AJ's technique, or should i say revelation is the most sensible and easiest to grasp on both an intellectual and visceral level this experienced student has ever come across. Highly recommend it!",1136246400,8,1082,4.649214659685864
2408675,3,B000B8JI9U,These DVD's are worth watching if your buddy screwed up and bought them.  AJ makes quite a few good points but it probably could all be summed up in 1 dvd...and should and then sold for 19.99 plus S&H.  The biggest help I've recieved from watching these are improvement and a better overall understanding of my short game.  It's pretty hard to stay focused listening to the guy's schtick and lame overall presentation.  5 stars if he releases a condensed version for less than 30 bucks.  I'm a high (30+) handicapper,1129593600,7,516,4.626373626373627
2408676,2,B000B8JI9U,"Helpful for a beginner, but an experienced golfer won't learn a lot from this series.",1126656000,2,85,4.733333333333333
2408677,3,B000B8JI9U,"I've used all the AJ Reveals the Truth About Golf DVDs and how much you get out of them really depends on you. I am a high handicapper, and have been playing the game for about 6 years, IMHO the instruction is somewhat inconsistent, some is good, some is not so good. I would say that this set is for the intermediate player, someone who has knows how to swing the club and play, but hasn't quite figured out how to control ball flight yet and is sort of in a rut. If you are an absolute beginner (have no clue how to swing a club), go get lessons from a professional, these DVD's can supplement your learning but they will NOT teach you the fundementals. If you are a low handicapper, you will probably be bored watching these DVDs.  AJ Bonar is a good teacher, he has a way of demystifying the golf swing and explaining things using easy to understand concepts. I could have done without the annoying music, card trick and guitar playing schtick, but it is a mere distraction and doesn't take away from the main message.  What is this ""Truth""? The truth according to Bonar is that there is no ""perfect golf swing"". The Bonar message in summary is that the golf club is a tool and by using the club correctly, as it is designed to work, you can make the golf ball do what you want. It's a results oriented approach.  Bonar teaches like to teach by analogy e.g. the golf club is like a baseball bat, the club is like a hammer etc.. While this is good in that it frees us of traditional teaching dogma involving swing mechanics, it also is rather light on details. Where do you position the ball? Where do you put your feet? What do you do with your arms? The short game DVDs are probably the best I've seen. Bonar believes in keeping it simple and effective and theres a lot of meat here, unlike the other disks he covers details like the ball position and the swing. The putting DVD has some interesting ways at thinking about putting. The driver DVDs expand on the ""Truth"" concept and deal with working the ball. I would recommend this set, also there is a money back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose (I did not gain 30 yards or reduce my handicap by 30%).",1120176000,25,2170,4.313725490196078
2408678,1,B000B8JI9U,"Many times you hear people say, ""you get what you pay for"" unfortunately that was not the case this time.  I was very unsatisfied with the lack of swing mechanics covered in this series.  A couple of nice pointers for the beginning golfer regarding chipping were about all I picked up for my ""trouble.""  I would definitely recommend against purchasing this product.",1101859200,12,365,4.854838709677419
2408679,5,B000B8JI9U,"This is a series of DVDs on hitting the golf ball by teaching golf pro AJ Bonar. It encompasses the drive, irons, chipping, pitching, bunkers and putting.
 The first disc discusses some theory on how to hit the ball correctly; i.e. why the ball does what it does when you hit it. This same disc then proceeds to instruct on how to put the theory into real time application on the driving range and then the golf course with the goal of eliminating those troublesome slices and hooks.
However, as good as the discs are on hitting the driver and irons, it is,The Short Game disc that is the real gem in this whole golf instruction package. This is the lesson that will absolutely help you get up and down from just off the green with great regularity with a simple, repeatable technique.
The discs are high quality video, with some slow motion and animation to enhance the instruction. It doesn't take too long to realize that AJ Bonar is man that loves to teach: he has an ability to get his ideas across in a way that are easy to understand and, more importantly, makes sense. I addition to good golf instructions, AJ injects a sense of humor in these discs: they are just fun to watch.
I've had these discs approximately a month now and I've benefited greatly by repeated viewings of certain segments of these lessons. There is so much information on these discs that it is impossible to see and absorb all the info with a single viewing. And like anything worthwhile you must go out and practice the ideas which AJ teaches.
One other thing: I had a question regarding some point on the disc and wrote an e-mail to the support centre and I received an e-mail back the next day from AJ himself.
All in all, a teaching golf package that delivered what the infomercial promised, (at least for me it did) and with a support system that you can actually benefit from.",1090195200,45,1863,4.479411764705882
2408680,1,B000B8JI9U,"This is a dissapointing set of CD's. Lots of Blah, Blah, Blah, very little meat. Most reviewers and fans of this ""secret"" are High Handicappers that ""started to work in earnest"" on their games about the time they got the tapes. Believe me it was the working on Their game not the ""secret"" that helped. You can go to Golf Magazine Online (October 2006 I believe) and read in 10 minutes what these tapes take hours to tell you. As a matter of fact I will tell you in one sentence what the ""secret"" is. Hit down and through the ball and rotate the clubface with your hands through impact. TaDa!!

2408681,4,B000B8JI9U,If you are the type of golfer that is always looking for some simple bit of 'magic' or 'secret' you won't find it.  There is very little if any traditional instruction.  What you will find is a very good description of what the golf club has to do to strike the ball solidly and why.  So if your an analytical type person that learns from mechanical positions ect. you will hate this.  If you learn by how things feel this will be good for you!,1173225600,,444,4.188235294117647
2408682,1,B000B8JI9U,"What a complete waste of my time. I'm an above average golfer and would not recommend this for golfers of any level. He drivels on about all kinds of stuff including singing his own song at the end (poorly,) but nothing to help us improve at the game we love. Maybe AJ thinks the cheezy card trick he reveals at the end is worth the $39. I'd send you my copy for free, but I already threw it away because I couldn't stand the reminder around the house that I actually paid for this. I would have given it no stars, but that wasn't an option.  Scott L",1172620800,3,550,4.092592592592593
2408683,1,B000B8JI9U,"I bought this product about 4 years ago and returned within weeks. At the time of purchase I had been golfing for about 7 years - with little success. 100+ HCP

The DVD set covers a few concepts but nothing I consider useful to creating a repeatable swing.  It didn't take long to go through the entire DVD set and I was thinking...""hmm I must have lost a DVD somehwere....coud that be it!!!?"".  PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.

I was shocked that there was such a promotional effort to sell this through infomercials.  There was a lineup of celeberities and regular folks praising this package for it's effectiveness.  It is garbage.  The concepts are fine to learn....but if that was all there was to learn..we all would be PGA pros overnight.

A much much better choice is the 8 Step Swing. <---Get this (good comprehensive study of the swing - with useful drills).  Avoid this AJ thing.",1172275200,5,901,4.616352201257862
2408684,4,B000B8JI9U,"I started to play golf in July 2006.  Like anyone else I had the usual problems - hands everywhere, legs everywhere, shoulders one way and hips another and none of which made the ball go further than I could throw it.

I bought Ben Hogan's 'Five' book.  Great book, read it twice.  Best thing about that book is the section on grip and the 'active tension' in stance.  But, still everything was everywhere.  By chance I bought Golf Magazine and a front story was on AJ Bonar.  Get the article. They tested his theory with 30,000 golf swings - it works. That's fact, not sales fiction.

I went out and got the DVD package set.  AJ spends a lot of time on the science because if you don't get that part of it, you won't believe the rest.  I put what was on the DVD into practice and I can tell you it's made a huge difference.  I'm not 100% consistent, but I'm hitting a 5 iron an average of 150 yards with about a 10 to 15 variance from the target on the driving range (I'm 35, in reasonable shape).  I still have issues with the 3 wood (keep topping the damn ball) and don't even bother with the driver yet, but everything from a 4 iron down I can handle myself.  His techniques work!

By luck, I live in California and I've had two lessons with him as well.  The first lesson was a group lesson with myself and a couple of old-timers who'd been playing for a long time.  They were both extremely pleased and you saw the noticable improvement in their game.

The best thing that AJ Bonar says is this, 'when you go to hit a nail with a hammer what's the most important part of the process? Pulling the hammer back or striking down?' It's the down stroke you need to focus on.

The main criticism of the DVD in my opinion is that there aren't enough slo-mo takes of the steepness of the downward angle, the release of the head and emphasis of the hands forward all together.  Other than that, it's great. The section in chipping is so simple and easy it's almost a trick.

YOu simply need to keep an open mind to the notion that it's not about the 'swing'.  It's about hitting the ball.

I can tell you, I love getting on the range and seeing that ball fly straight(ish) and going further and further as the weeks go by. I'm still not that great playing on a course as I'm not used to uneven surfaces and the differnt ground types (one drawback of practicing on mats on a driving range I suppose) but that'll come with the right exposure.

2408685,1,B000B8JI9U,"The entire thing focused on one aspect of golf...the impact.  Nothing about grip, shoulders, etc.  I'm not conviced AJ himself even knows how to golf.  Trust me, save your money.  Check out Jim Mclean's Eight-step swing if you really want to learn about the ENTIRE golf swing.",1155168000,3,276,4.808510638297872
2408686,4,B000B8JI9U,"If you're like a lot of golfers who are constantly checking out different instructors, books, videos, tips, etc., then you know sometimes swingmechanics can be over-complicated. You have played some decent golf in the past, and then will suddenly find yourself in the clumsy and numb wasteland of double-bogeys and hikes through the woods and no matter how many tips you try to recall, how many analogies you try to remember, nothing can make the club click against the ball.

This video set will tell you what you need to know.

This isn't for the beginner, this is for the highhandicapper who has a knowledge of the basics, but still struggles, sometimes desperately, to break 90.

AJ explains the simple things that you either were ever told, or completely forgot in the fog of trying new tips, new clubs, new grips, etc.

2408687,5,B000B8JI9U,"If you are looking for an instructional video just like all of the other ones then don't buy this.  In order to get the value out of these videos you have to forget everything else you've learned and believe in the tapes.  I typically shoot in the 70's but have not been a great driver of the golf ball.  After watching the tapes  and practicing it for about a month I am hitting fairway after fairway.  I don't think I hit it any further than I did before but I am a lot more accurate and consistent.  I agree with most people that the videos could be sold for half the price and put into one DVD, but I'm still very glad I bought them.  When I played before I would have about 6-10 things I would think about before hitting the ball, and I felt like I needed to do all of them correctly or I would hit a bad shot.  Now I only have to think about one or two things and I'm getting to the point where I don't have to think at all.  If you are thinking about buying them I would say go for it.",1148688000,6,992,3.92
2408688,4,B000B8JI9U,"I watched the truth about golf video.  No one before had really focused on telling me how one should hit the ball with the club.  Modern teaching focuses on swing, position, etc. He focuses more on how the club face should smack the golf ball.

He treats golf as an athletic endeavor of if you have good hand eye coordination and allow that to work you should be able to ""hit down on the ball"" with your iron and make the ball go up.

That being said, as with most golf ""info"" its over priced, but if he sold it for 10 dollars no one would find it valuble because no worthwhile golf aid could sell that cheap. (i.e. $3.00 a gallon perfume would not sell as much as $3,000.00 an ounce perfume).

It provides some ""mental imagery"" that has helped my game, but I don't know to what quantifiable extent other than it helps me get back on track when I stand over a golf ball and get that ""fear"" of ""what do I move first"".

Don't spend your last 100 dollars on it, but if you routinely blow a lot of money like I do on golf training aids, its as good as anything else I've tried.",1148428800,10,1073,4.110047846889952

So far 30 minutes have past and all he's done is lecture about ping-pong, the movement of the hand, and the constellation.  I can't believe he charged more than $10 for this.  Now he's lecturing about golf history.  This is the first time he's actually brought a club out from his bag, but it was just to illustrate the tale of the beginning of golf.  If you can borrow this video from someone it might be mildly helpful but I don't recommend you waste money on it.",1142812800,5,542,4.38

Years have passed and I quit playing golf for a few years.  I returned to a 10 hdcp.  I bought all of his videos and in no time, I was back playing good golf again.
