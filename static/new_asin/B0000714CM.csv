1798505,5,B0000714CM,Everyone interested in Stravinsky ballet music will certainly value this amazing recording. The Royal Ballet at his best.,1142380800,4,121,5.777777777777778
1798506,4,B0000714CM,"This DVD contains two marvelous works of Igor Stravinsky:  his Firebird and Les Noces [the Wedding], each performed in ballet to a profoundly different effect.  I am sure you will find this disc both enthralling and deeply disappointing.

The Firebird is Stravinsky's most popular work, and it receives top billing here. Musically, it is an experimental work, preparing the foundation for the revolution that is Le Sacre du Printemps.  Yet, its treatment by thr Royal Ballet in costumes, scenery, and dance, is as a work of pure classical ballet, marked by grace, and a remarkable lack of dynamism.  Firebird is not not Swan Lake (despite some similarities in their underlying myths); to treat Stravinsky like Tschaikovsky is to produce a banal anachronism.  One ought not to blame Folkine here -- at least not entirely, for the Kirov's Return of the Firebird shows the excitement that can be produced in Folkine/Stravinsky conbinations, even if the Kirov's technical effects a bit over the top.

Ah!, but the production Les Noces with choreography by Nijinskaya is among the most extraordinary on disc.  Through most of his music, Stravinsky in interested not in portraying the day to day reality of individual lives but the excitement and drama of community rituals.  Nijinskaya, the sister of Nijinsky, choreographed a dance of extraordinary originality based on her own unique conception of formalized movement that underscores Stravinsky's artistic genius.  Those who, like me, love the Taymor production of Oedipus Rex with Norman & Ozawa will be intoxicated by this dance.  (Drew's commentary on Les Noces is the most enjoyable ""extra"" I have found on DVD.)  If, however, you find these works distasteful, I am sure you will enjoy the Royal Ballet's Firebird.",1133049600,17,1766,5.179577464788732
1798507,2,B0000714CM,"well performed, great for the lover of CLASSIC ballet. shot on a very obvious childishly simple stage. the ballet is technically correct but dead. no tv effects were used. look at the newest ""midsummer night's dream"" dvd to see what can be done with video and a computer. this firebird dvd is well danced but boring. i think it is a terrible dvd of an exciting ballet. this is not the dvd to teach your kids to love ballet. sorry . i am so disappointed with this dvd that i am trying to return it.

1798508,5,B0000714CM,"Before getting this version of The Firebird I got the recently relesaed version by the Bolshoi called ""The Firebird Returns"", and I can testify to the London version's superiority, as far as dancing and stgaing are concerned. Leanne Benjamin is exquisite as the Firebird, her first pas de deux with Johnathan Cope is a marvel of precision and balance between dancing and pantomime, as she desperately tries to free herself from the Prince's arms. Mr Cope does not have much to do, no solos nor variations, so it's difficult to judge his talent from this tape - get a copy of The Prince of the Pagodas to see what he is capable of! Mr. Drew's Kotschei is a marvel of characterization: evil with a touch of humour, so far superior to his Russian counterpart!
As for the sets, I believe they do not reproduce the 1909 originals, which were destroyed by humidity, but the new ones made for the 1922 revival.
As for Les Noces, I found the version released by the Paris Opera Ballet better danced. They sing a French translation of the Russian text and their male soloist - Kader Belarbi - transmits a sense of dignity to the nuptial ceremony that is lacking in Mr. Pickering.
One should not neglet to mention Mr. David Drew's funny account of how Ms. Bronislava Nijinska taught the choreographyto the first cast in the 60'.",1082332800,33,1318,4.636752136752137
1798509,5,B0000714CM,"The Firebird and Les Noces, two disparate ballets by Igor Stravinsky, are skillfully danced by The Royal Ballet of Covent Garden on this DVD recorded in 2001. The Firebird is a revival of the original Mikhail Fokine choreography. Bronislava Nijinska's Les Noces (The Wedding) is also faithfully reproduced. The scenery and costumes of The Firebird are striking and lavish, while they are plain and austere for Les Noces.
The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, under the able direction of John Carewe, beautifully performs the unabridged score of The Firebird. Before the curtain rises, an on-screen plot synopsis accompanies the first few minutes of music. From start to finish, the well-mannered British audience (as opposed to the typically clap-happy American audience) does not needlessly interrupt the dancing with inappropriate, annoying applause. In the opening scene, Leanne Benjamin, the Firebird, flits across the stage with bird-like jumps. Prince Ivan, Jonathan Cope, appears next, hopping down from the wall that encloses the enchanted garden of the immortal and evil sorcerer Kotschei. Ivan hides, lying in wait to catch the Firebird and seizes her after she steals an apple from the magic tree. What ensues is a captivating performance by Ms Benjamin. Her acting is first-rate but her dancing is inspired, arms waving and hands fluttering. She is the firebird. Her leg work, turns, and jumps (developpes, chaines, and jetes) are marvelously executed. Jonathan Cope's partnering shows sensitivity and deftness. He and Benjamin dance as one, his lifting very silky and effortless. Cope's facial expressions and body language demonstrate fine acting. David Drew as Kotschei is deliciously grotesque: long fingernails, black skeleton costume, flowing cape, humped back, and scraggly beard. His grotesqueness, however, is tinged with humor. Genesia Rosato, the beautiful Tsarevna, is suitably demure. She and her 12 princesses play catch with apples taken from the enchanted tree (not great dancing, but an interesting diversion). Watching these attractive women in their long nightgowns prancing around the stage provides pleasure. The finale, full of pomp and circumstance, is emotionally and visually satisfying, intensified by a succession of full orchestral chords.
In Les Noces, the two principals--Zenaida Yanowsky as the bride and David Pickering her groom--are nice to look at, but they do little dancing. The real stars in this dance-cantata are the men and women (especially the women) of the corps de ballet. Because this is a tricky ballet, full of changing beats and irregular tempos, dancers can easily lose count and make errors. Fortunately, they never do. Nijinska's choreography is just as fresh and modern today as it was when it was first performed in 1923. But the music (composed for four pianos, percussion, small chorus, and four soloists) is what makes this ballet-cantata a masterpiece.
These two performances are emotionally and intellectually stimulating. Anyone who appreciates Stravinsky will be rewarded with the purchase of this DVD.",1048809600,75,3077,5.48
1798510,5,B0000714CM,"This excellent version of two of Stravinsky's classic scores is danced by the superb Royal Ballet. 'Firebird' is particularly enthralling, with the recreation of the original Diaghilev sets of 1909. Ballet lovers will also be glad to have this rare chance to see 'Les noces', rarley performed but here given a persuasive performance by the company. I would have liked to see the two ballets performed in the opposite order, as Firebird might have been a more colourful ending - but this does not in any way mar a briliant issue.",1037836800,22,528,4.813186813186813
1798531,5,B0000714CM,"For years I have read about what a great ballet The Firebird was, and I'm happy to say that I completely agree with the critics.",1354492800,,128,4.16
1798532,5,B0000714CM,"I'm no authority on ballet, yet I love it.  This DVD satisfied all my wishes for great at-home entertainment.  What disappoints me most about video formats of ballets is that the producer/director often gets carried away with camera movement to the point where much of the production is lost visually. When there are only a few dancers on stage or in movement, it's fine to focus on them, but sometimes, and sometimes too often, the camera gets so busy that  we miss the full impact of the  spectacle on stage.  Not so here.  The camera work was much to my liking.  Ballet is theatre, not film, and should be recorded with that foremost in mind, and that is what they have done here.  I loved everything about the two ballets - the same composer but years apart with Les Noces representing a striking difference illustrating, and ending in his remarkable evolution in style.  The entire company was extraordinary, and  Leanne Benjamin was brilliantly captivating as the Firebird.  That it was choreographed by Michael Folkine brings a pang of melancholy for it takes us back to the days of the great Diagalev - died at 50, quel tragique.  So much history of great artists for all to enjoy on this DVD. The interviews and the rehearsals are immensely entertaining as well.  Would love to see more of that on ballet DVDs.  I should also mention that the audio is sensational.  It put my sub-woofer to the test!!  I loved it!  Highly recommended.",1260921600,7,1443,4.685258964143427
1798533,3,B0000714CM,"i had mixed feelings about this particular dvd that i am sure will ""ruffle the feathers"" of stravinsky and modern ballet fans. i found the first feature ""the firebird"" a feast for the eyes. the story here is your standard type fantasy/fairy tale. you can lump it in with say the nutcracker or maybe sleeping beauty. leann benjamin and jonathan cope turn in marvelous performances here. i found mikhail fokines choreography, while consistent to the story line, interesting enough, though maybe not quite my cup of tea.  stravinskys score is familiar and likable enough but again not really my cup of tea. the second feature, ""les noces"" was absolutely horrid. i hated everything about this ""ahem"" ballet. the choreography by ""the legendary nijinska"", is typically (roll your eyes) modern.  just endless jumping up and down, running back and forth, stiff movements, the body fighting against itself trying desperately not to exude gracefulness. banal, really. if their are any purely balletic moments they are completely overshadowed by the corps de regimen and their unison hop. the music though is what i think really killed it for me. its shrill and annoying, sounding more to me like the soundtrack to the exorcist. it pierces the silence with shrieking and yelling operatic voices over percussive crashes and symphonic chaos, indeed this is like the ""death metal"" of classical music. this music would be mucho more at home in say a ""batman"" flick. now mind you, this is supposed to be a wedding. you know, a time for joy and excitement? the musical score here is anything but. the dancers movement anything but. why these miserable faces? the blank stares? the pervasiveness of doom and gloom is way thick here. some may see expressions of joy. i sense foreboding and an underlying resentment. depressing to watch and listen to. on the technical side, the production is excellent. picture quality is crisp and clear. the color reproduction for the firebird is vibrant and pleasing to the eye. id say the same for les noces but even here the costumes and set(?) were as bland and colorless as could possibly be. both features offer excellent editing. the audio is high quality for those of you who would torture their neighbors and/or loved ones at strange hours with the music of les noces. (i know, i know, im rubbing it in.) in conclusion, i am not especially pleased with this purchase, however, i have heard it said that good art is supposed to make you feel something. and sitting thru les noces induced a repulsiveness in me that i do not normally  associate with the fine art of ballet. so maybe it has achieved what the authors set out to do and i have just witnessed a masterpiece.",1236470400,8,2693,4.837310195227766
1798534,5,B0000714CM,"I thought I probably already had two of the best ""Firebirds"" with the Royal Ballet's VHS recording of Dame Margot Fonteyn and The Kirov Celebrates Nijinsky with Diana Vishneva, but when I saw this BBC copy starring Leanne Benjamin, I think I may NOW have the best. (I have since purchased ""Return of the Firebird w/ Nina Ananiashvili"")........(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Firebird-Petrushka-Firebird-Scheherazade/dp/B00006L74J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Firebird: Petrushka/Firebird/Scheherazade</a>)......and I still like Leanne best. This version is as close to Hi-Def as you can get in quality of reproduction w/o being an HD DVD. Being a PAL format, I cannot play it on my Hi-Def. player but using a Phillips player with HDMI input, it is very close to Hi-DEF. NOTE: Mine is PAL format (from China), but you CAN get it in the NTSC format, be sure and check.

Leanne Benjamin, with those huge, startlingly beautiful brown eyes, makes for a perfect subject of a bird in captivity, as she struggles fiercely to escape Prince Ivan's grasp. She can open her eyes wider than anyone I have ever seen. Leanne's struggle for freedom is better than either Fonteyn or Vishneva who struggles the least. Have you ever held a wild bird in your hands? They never give up trying to get away until they are completely exhausted. Leanne is very impressive in her struggle to get away from Ivan.

The camera work on this ballet is very good, as they get close-ups w/o losing any of the dance steps, to concentrate on those beautiful eyes yearning so desperately to be released. When the camera gets a close-up of her face just before she is released I catch my breath it is so utterly beautiful. I freeze frame on that close-up and just stare at her face, it is so remarkable. She is not the most beautiful woman perhaps, but in this role, with her big eyes, her long nose, and pert lips she fit the part very well. Her dancing in this ballet is as good as Margot Fonteyn's, if I can say that without bringing the wrath of all the ages down upon me. The only complaint I could make here, is the ballet isn't long enough. I just didn't want it to end.

The Firebird is by far Stravinsky""s best music, however Les Noces did not appeal to me, in fact, I gave up on it before the end. But, I will be fair and play it again through to the end. You will watch The Firebird over and over again I can assure you.

The costumes and sets for this ballet are good but the stone wall made up of victims of the Immortal Kotchei, in the Kirov version was the most impressive, and the costume on Kotchei in the Kirov version is the best, plus his acting is also best. The costumes on the twelve princesses are pretty much the same in all the ballets I've seen, except the Kirov version, where the Tsarevna has a splash of color that distinguishes her from the others......<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kirov-Celebrates-Nijinsky-Sheherazade-La-Spectre-de-la-Rose-The-Polovtsian-Dances-The-Firebird/dp/B0006SSQ6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kirov Celebrates Nijinsky / Sheherazade, La Spectre de la Rose, The Polovtsian Dances, The Firebird</a>

This ballet by the Royal Ballet Company is worth every penny you pay, just to see the close-up of Leanne Benjamin's face before she gives Ivan her feather, but of course, you do get to hear some wonderful music by Igor Stravinsky as well. You will need to turn the volume up to hear the opening strains of the bass violins of the Prelude. They are magnificent. Some of Stravinsky's best and most beautiful music occurs during the interaction of Ivan, the twelve princesses and the Tsarevna. It's nice to hear the change in style of the music, because the rest of the music is so raucous, good mind you, but very energetic, to say the least. The producers of this version of The Firebird do a good job of keeping her in the picture during the ""dance to exhaustion"" scene where it is important to see her instructions to the dancers with her arm and hand gestures. Margot Fonteyn is completely left out of the picture for quite a bit of that segment, and to my mind, she should never be off camera.

This is not a cheap DVD, by any means, but I think you will enjoy it as much as I have. I have not said anything about Les Noces because, as I said, it did not appeal to me. I had never heard of it before, but did read a review before purchasing this DVD. Les Noces means ""The Wedding"". It is too much like modern dance for my taste. I purchased this for The Firebird. The running time for the entire DVD is only 80 minutes, and Firebird is a little over 49 minutes including the credits, so it is quite short, but still worth owning, if only for Firebird.",1218844800,8,4785,4.836385836385836
1798535,5,B0000714CM,"I want to add my bit to the reviews here. I have enjoyed every moment of these two ballets which are of totally different styles of dancing. I have seen the extended version of Firebird on the 'Firebird Returns' but for personal drama  this is the better version. The Les Noces, in my opinion, is  beautiful and unique in its cheography. The sound is very solid - surround sound - and the thumps give one the goosebumps. All said, one has to recall the different choreographies of the two ballets to fully enjoy the DVD. The beautiful and unique sounds that end the Wedding are particularly powerful and one will remember them for years.",1217548800,4,637,4.578947368421052

1798537,5,B0000714CM,"The five stars are for The Firebird. Excellent! I've always loved the Firebird Suite music, and finally I got to see what it's all about. Excellent dancing, staging, choreography, story, and music! The shorter Les Noces is too modern for me (even though it was choreographed a long time ago). I just don't get it (I also don't get Modern Art (unless it simply appeals to the eye by its color and shape, which this ballet does not)). I first watched the short documentary about rehearsing the first showing of it, which was presided over by the creator of the Les Noces (minus its music), Madame Nijinska, and then watched the shorter documentary of the current show's rehearsal of it, so I knew what I was getting into. But it was still just noise and syncopated movement to me. But the DVD is worth buying for The Firebird. In fact, I believe this version belongs in every balletomane's collection.",1213056000,4,899,4.660377358490566
1798538,3,B0000714CM,"The Paris Opera Ballet laserdisc is definitive for Les Noces.  The Afternoon of a Faun is also superlative at every level.

This DVD is most welcome.  The dancing in both Firebird and Les Noces is aboveaverage.  However, particularly in Les Noces the ensemble lacks precision, verve, and the required intensity.  This is a very difficult work, of great musical inventiveness and superior and hugely difficult choreography.  This is a work that should judge ballet groups...and the Royal Ballet simply does not rise to this high mark.

7973625,1,B0000714CM,"The choreography is constantly interrupted by the needless cutting between shots. Many of the reviews for this DVD give the impression that it is more or less one static shot (the ideal, since one static shot wouldn't fragment and obscure Nijinska's choreography), but this is not the case. This video cuts as arbitrarily to close ups, mid shots, 45-degree angles, zooms, and occasionally a long shot, as much as all other films of ballets seem to do. Many great moments of the ballet are lost for the sake of a meaningless close up. Any sense of the totality of the choreography is obstructed.
The universal fault of ballet video editors is that they don't realise that no one has any interest in the faces of the dancers. Do we need to remind them that Nijinska's work is more of an attraction than the work of Zenaida Yanowsky's makeup assistant?
