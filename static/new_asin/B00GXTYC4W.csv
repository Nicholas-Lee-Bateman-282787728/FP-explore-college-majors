8628528,5,B00GXTYC4W,"I happened to attend this concert. it was at a pivotal time in Young's career, where he turned it all around and became once again a galvanizing artist. this concert preceeds the release of ""Freedom"". All acoustic. my life in particular was changed forever during ""No More"", my first time hearing the song. listen yourself, it could happen to you, too. great DVD!",1279584000,,363,4.777777777777778
8628529,2,B00GXTYC4W,"The promise of a long list of fine Neil Young songs, is dashed by terrible picture quality and average sound quality.

How dissapointing as you look through the hazy fog of grainy visuals to think of what might have been.  If you are a Neil Young fan who wants all that he has produced then buy this DVD.

If you are a first timer or curious about Neil Young and his music, stick with 'Heart of Gold"" DVD or the Jim Jarmusch doco on NY and Crazy Horse.  Even the slightly disjointed and strangeled duo with Bruce Springstien  fails to rescue this DVD from it's quality issues.",1268524800,,576,4.345794392523365
8628530,4,B00GXTYC4W,"Quite frankly, the sound is excellent and the video very, very good. Maybe the other reviews were based on VHS tapes. I did see this on VHS in early '90 and thought it badly shot. Somebody cleaned this up in the transfer to DVD. Sound separation is accurate, the dynamics have a depth and clarity I hadn't heard before. This is way above a bootleg, and frankly better than what I've seen out of Archives so far. The performance is nothing short of terrific. I approached this with a great deal of skepticism, but I am very glad I bought this. This is from a period when Young still had his artistic wits about him and was intent on breathing life into his career again after the disputes with Geffen. The crazy Canuck is on fire and very engaged with the audience. He seems to be genuinely enjoying himself. If you are a Young fan, do yourself an enormous favour and pick this up. It's very, very good. One of his best.",1261094400,6,919,4.348837209302325
8628531,3,B00GXTYC4W,"The picture is horrible.  There was a VHS release of some of these songs at the time of the Freedom CD release, in fact the VHS was called Freedom.  If memory serves me the quality of that was far better than this, but there are more songs here, and thats where things are great.  A fantastic almost solo show of Neil and his acoustic guitar. Lets hope a better quality master of this show emerges somewhere, this looks like it could have been copied from Youtube of a bootlegged show.",1248480000,7,485,4.366666666666666
8628532,1,B00GXTYC4W,Nice guitar playing and singing form Neil but the video looks like it was shot on a mobile phone camera! It is absolutely atrocious and sometimes you can barely make out Neil's face such is the poor quality of video. This DVD is not for those who like to sit in and chill out at the weekend with a good entertaining music performance (as I do) but is for devout Neil Young fans only who might be prepared to put up with the rubish picture.,1245974400,16,439,4.176470588235294
