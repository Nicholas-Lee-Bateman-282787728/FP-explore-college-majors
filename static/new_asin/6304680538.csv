917445,4,6304680538,"This is a film distributed by Howco International Pictures back in October 1957 (not 1958 as it says on the box). Yet another alien invasion film dealing with possession and the threat of atomic weapons-- all well-trod motifs in 1950s science fiction. Here John Agar plays a scientist named Steve Marsh and he is taken over by a megalomaniac alien named Gore. so far a cliche. However, another brain from the planet Arous, named Val, acts as a policeman and instructs Steve's girlfriend how to get rid of Gore. The use of a bad alien and a good alien makes this film slightly better than too many one-dimensional alien invasion films where aliens are evil, wicked, and must be destroyed. I've always preferred the sympathetic alien films, and loathe such films as Independence Day which ridicules such an idea. I believe if aliens exists that they must be benevolent and not wicked. At any rate, it is impressive that John Agar got to play two roles simultaneously: the nice scientist Steve, and the megalomaniac Gore. Yet the film has a Puritanical streak in it, for example, Steve can only be passionate and lustful when possessed by Gore, indicating that lust and rough sex was only permitted if one is a megalomaniac alien invader. The sets are very ordinary, and special effects are cheap. For a Puritanical film it is interesting to see scenes of Sally wearing tight jeans out in the desert, with a brief glance of her butt. On the whole, a rather short but enjoyable film spoilt by an absurd and clumsy ending. Most of the film has the floating brain as a holographic image, but at the end the brain has materialized and is solid and thus can be destroyed. Val explanation does not explain enough for that.",1397001600,4,1713,4.694352159468439

His cockiness while being controlled by the alien brain is well acted . His silver eyes become very noticeable when the brain is doing destructive things while residing in him. Oh how the brain finds his girl Sally very desirable. A new sensation never known on the planet Arous of of course. How can brains do the boom boom anyway? Power and more power. To rule the universe is all Gore wants along with revenge to his planet. Poor Mr. Agar is just a poor pawn who wishes he was not a victim of these maniacal brain. He generates his power through Steve's (Agar) eyes. He blows up planes out of the air. He makes atomic explosions but then runs out of oxygen so he has to leave the body for a while and Steve can then be a normal good guy for a while. A good brain comes to save the day. But he must take another body to watch the Gore the bad brain in incognito. I won't give away the plot or ending, but it is truly a great movie on a Saturday night. It is like going to the movie as a kid again or watching on late night tv when you were allowed to stay up. This is 5 star material. I watch a lot of these movies with a friend via telephone and dvd sync. Great fun to watch this movie with someone who loves this 50's stuff as well. If the wife won't watch them with you, call someone who does and sync up. Be a kid again and watch a 5 star 50's monster movie and make fun of scenes together.

917451,5,6304680538,"Its hot-hot-hot, at least 120 degrees, when a hot blast of gamma is detected coming from Mystery Mountain!  Investigating this strange occurrence was probably the responsible thing to do, but in hindsight, really stupid, at least for poor Dan (Robert Fuller).  Well, poor scientist Steve March (John Agar) didn't fare any better, he had to share brain space with a psychotic brain named Gor, newly escaped from the planet Arous.  I hate it when that happens; some people barely have enough room for the brain theyve got, never mind an uninvited guest!  Oh what to do, what to do when a brain wants to take over the world, and because hes in your head, you just know youll get the blame for it.
I would have loved to have been present when this idea was pitched.  Not just one brain on the loose, but two!  The second ones in a dog.  It has HIT written all over it.  On a budget of a buck fifty-two we can even get that overrated ham John Agar to play the part of the possessed scientist.  No one can play crazy like John can!  Shove a couple of tin foil contacts in his eyes and I tell you itll be magic!  Cant lose.  Sure fire.  Oscars, here we come!

This is one of those movies which almost makes you feel like an idiot for sitting through the whole thing.  Worse.  Finding out you like it.  Its probably one of the dumbest movies Ive ever seen but I love it.  Its hilarious.  The actors played it as if it was Shakespeare.  Who does that with a script like they had!?

Evil alien brain crashes in the desert, takes over a scientist only to find out he REALLY likes earth women. Meanwhile good alien brain comes after him and decides to take up residence in a dog so he can observe evil brain and figure out how to stop him. I'm not making this up. Evil brain threatens the world and makes lots of wide eyed crazy looking faces as planes are destroyed just by looking at them. The acting is bad throughout with the exception of Joyce Meadows who has to fight off the leacherous advances of the evil brain. Maybe she wasn't acting? Picture quality is fine.

The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.

Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.

If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.

917607,3,6304680538,"I have the Image Entertainment DVD 2000 edition.

First off, the DVD quality is good and sharp, with nice contrast and better then expected sharpness.

I will not go into the story line, since that would be repetitive, but I do enjoy watching this movie.
It has a certain quaint, nostalgic charm.

Folks who say this is ""the worst movie ever made"" clearly knows nothing about filmmaking.
Technicly, this is a competently made film. It has the usual 3 act story structure, it's well photographed
and well edited. I would challenge these folks to make their own movie and find out how hard they are to make!

If you want to see a really bad and poorly made film, watch any Ed Woods film!!

John Agar gives what has to be the most over-the-top performance of his carear, sometimes reminding me of Jack
Nicholson in The Shining.

I think you have to keep in mind the time period in which this movie was made. Low budget movies geared to teens
at the drive-in were being cranked out like crazy back in the 50's, and there are plenty other films made in
that time which were much worse.

Yes, the story is very silly, as is the not so special FX. But that was fine for a young 1958 audience.

The fact that this little gem is still being seen and writen about today (even if only for nostalgia sake) is
testimony to it's staying power.

A good story, with flowing scenes, it's a certainly good movie for anyone that enjoys the older science fiction films.  Just a different story with the alien with wild thoughts.",1292025600,,456,4.3023255813953485
917609,3,6304680538,"Released in 1957, THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS is a competently made yet entirely uninspired ""B"" movie that over the years has acquired a quasi-cult status: if you're into 1950s hack sci-fi, you'll love it; if not, you won't.

The story is actually imaginative.  Steve March (John Agar) is a nuclear scientist working in the southwest who detects unexpected radioactivity in the vicinity of Mystery Mountain.  When he travels to this remote location, he is possed by Gor, a floating brain-like creature from the planet Arous.  Gor uses Steve's body to ravish Steve's girlfriend Sally (Joyce Meadows), blow up airplanes, and terrorize a group of scientists working on the atomic bomb.  Sally realizes that something isn't quite right and travels with her father (Thomas B. Henry) to Mystery Mountain to find a clue--and discovers Vol, yet another floating brain-like creature from Arous.  Vol explains that Gor is an escaped criminal, enlists the aid of Sally and her father, and later takes possession of their dog the better to spy on Gor.  Together the three seek a way to destroy Gor before he enslaves the planet!

Trouble with the movie is that the special effects are in any way special.  For the most part, they consist of double exposures: you can see through the brains and the airplanes that Gor destroys.  Now and then such effects are augmented by the a close up of John Agar wearing really ugly contacts.  At one point you get to see the airplane wreckage dangle by a wire; at another, when Gor becomes tangible, you get to see his wires as well.  But worse, at least from a cult point of view, is that the film lacks any sort of camp edge to put it over the top.  It's watchable, but not in a way that will make you smile at its silliness.  The DVD's picture is unexpectedly crisp and the sound reasonably good, but it lacks the appeal of things like ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES or ATTACK OF THE FIFTY WOMAN, so don't expect too much.

He's nice and bland and bad and dangerously over-the-top all in the same movie. He blows up planes and test sites laughing insanely to the delight of every hardcore fan of campy schlock!
Produced by cinematographer Jacques Marquette this film has much in common with his ATTACK OF THE 50FT. WOMAN, produced the same year and no doubt shot back to back. Both feature the same locations, even the same shot of the car in the opening of 50FT. appears in BRAIN when Sally (Joyce Meadows) and her father drive into the desert to investigate where Steve and Dan(Robert Fuller) disappeared for a week. Both films were directed by Nathan Juran (as Hertz). And both films even feature some rather risky kissing, lurid and sexy!
John Agar, my favorite 1950's sci-fi/horror actor (my God, he was in almost everything!)is perfect as the alien controlled victim, finally getting to play opposite his straight-arrow image in so many of these films (TRANTULA, MOLE PEOPLE, ATTACK OF THE PUPPET PEOPLE,etc.), and he really appears to be enjoying it as well!
A classic of it's kind THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS has to be seen to be appreciated...or at least believed.

917735,4,6304680538,"There's something about schlocky 50s movies that sets them apart from the
rest. Let's face it, ever since man captured images on film, we viewers
have been subjected to low budget gems, which are quickly forgotten and
rightly so.  With the introduction of the atomic age, the space age plus
the troubling social phenomenon, juvenile delinquency, the bargain basement films produced in the decade of the 50s, takes a sharp turn from
the conventional formula of earlier efforts, produced on shoe-string bud-
gets and targeted for similar audiences.

What emerges from these social and technological developments, is a genre
here-to-fore unknown.  What's astonishing about these movies, is that what
would normally be panned, is now praised but not for the intended reasons.
The Brain From Planet Arous is a prime example of a picture never intended
to generate laughs, yet audiences for the past fifty years have done lit-
tle else.  Think of it.  Has anyone ever turned away in horror from a hid-
eously distorted face seen through a water cooler?  Or how about any claims of a conscious contact with a higher power when John Agar offers
Barstow or Victorville to Joyce Meadows, in the ""Temptation of Christ""
scene?  As for Steve March's randiness, if you're not transfixed on the
suspension wires, notice the deficiencies of Gor's (the villain brain) an-
atomy.  It becomes clear why he's so content in the human form.  As for
Val (the hero brain), well that's another story, you know how rude dogs
can be.

and hope you enjoy it half as much as I do.  Have fun!",1192233600,,1636,4.8
917736,4,6304680538,"Well, if you are an empath, you'll enjoy this film. Empaths, in case you didn't know, love getting inside of others, wanting to be able to feel how others feel and feel how they think. This film, in my view, builds from that premise of soul to body consciouness and body to body transfer of the soul's yearning to experience other personality types other than its own.

The premise of this movie is real simple: A ""bad"" or ""evil intentioned"" brain, named ""Gore"", from the planet Arous, flees to the earth, to escape judgement for his crimes done on his own world. This brain is able to ""phase shift"" its atomic structure so it can enter into an organic body while taking control of it.  However, every 24 hours it must take on its organic form to breathe oxygen, making it vulnerable or mortal, otherwise it is immortal in its phase shifted, spiritual state of existence. When Gore takes over John Agar's character, Gore discovers the pleasures of the earthly flesh and makes many an attempt to come onto his wife, Jane Meadows, which is why I entitled this ""The Brain from the Planet Arousal"".  The ""come ons"" are very toned down by today's standards, but no doubt if this was ever updated, allot more would be showed if the story were ever remade.

Anyway, back to the plot. Enters in the ""good"" brain named ""Vol"", sent to retrieve Gore and take him back to Arous for his punishment. Until Vol can trap Gore out of the human body he has taken possession of so he can be destoyed, Gore works his plans for world dominance over the earth. The whole film is great actually, including the optical effects for its day; that is until the final scene of the film where you see the wires holding Gore up in the room, while the scientist, whose body was inhabited by Gore, tries to kill Gore with an axe.

The whole ending is a real dissappointment which is why I only gave the movie 4 stars, not 5. You go from this real serious movie to out right hysterics when you see the wires holding up the ""materialized"" Gore brain in the room. If more had been done to better resolve the final scene in this film, this would have been a sci fi classic in my view, perfect in every way, otherwise the rest of the movie is very well done, both in premise and execution.

It certainly is worth anyone's time to view for the sake of the first 95% of the film. Its almost a total empath's delight to view this film, except for the final scene at the end.",1188691200,,2434,4.373893805309734

Why not use them all the time and use skillful editting and camera angles when it comes to the brains entering/exiting bodies?  As if this wasn't bad enough, the two scenes when the airplanes are blown up are outright silly.  I mean, how many airplanes have one of their wings dangling as if from a string and swaying from side to side after blowing up in mid-air?!?!

The glowing-eyed brain croaks the boy-pal and inhabits the physicist, who then returns home to lunge at his pure-as-the-driven-snow fiancee. Man alive, the brain enjoys those sensations! He is here to take over the world in order to enslave the humans, in order to attack his own planet, in order to rule the universe! And he promises to take the girl along with him! ""How about some lunch,"" she demurrs! OK so the good sheriff brain floats in and occupies the dog. Makes total sense. Somehow, the bad-boy brain gains enough matter to be whacked on the head and killed (despite that fact that many books and statuettes are launched through him during the course of the movie). Everything is OK and we assume that someone will tell the general and the Russians and all the rest who are frantically gathering up all their radioactive material to send it to Los Alamos. The good brain does not stick around to explain things to the authorities so one assumes that all the parties involved (dad, the fiancees) are thrown in jail for murdering the boy-pal and the old man sheriff who accidently wandered in while our hero was possessed by the bad brain. And they're probably fingered for the airplanes, and the nuclear explosion too.

917741,4,6304680538,"Ouch!  As a fan of B-movies, I've seen quite a few groaners, but this one is uniquely bad in some ways, peculiarly good in others -- and so, definitely worth a look.

The premise is that two alien brains have come to Earth and they are able to invade life forms.  One brain is a criminal and he takes over a scientist in order to amass power on our planet; the other is an alien law enforcement officer, and he takes over a dog, the scientist's German Shepherd!  So far, high marks for creativity.  Oddly, the criminal brain is quite lusty, and makes many overt remarks and passes at the scientist's wife.  This is unusual for B-movies, but quite typical of the pulp literature of the time.

The special effects, as you'd expect, are abyssmal, but fun in a laughable way, and the science is  horrendous.  Still, the film is a jaw dropper and thus a must-see for fans of the genre.

No dvd extras except the movie's trailer.",1104796800,5,923,4.408284023668639

This is still a wonderful silly movie that benefits from being short, with the monster introduced early on. Agar is good, contorting himself in pain pretty convincingly as the monster enters and leaves his body, and he's got the megalomanical laugh down pat.  The special effects are primitive, especially when the alien monster is forced to assume his real shape and reveals himself to be a rubber blob bouncing around on a wire, but heck, you were expecting Industrial Light and Magic, maybe?  Everything is low budget: small cast, stock footage, a nuclear research lab with no equipment, and a set that consists of the desert and someone's suburban home.  And what other film mentions the ""fissure of Rolando""?  The extras on the DVD are virtually non-existent, consisting only of chapter search and the theatrical trailer.  Biographical info of the performers, especially the supporting cast, would have been welcome. If you like sci fi B-movies, this certainly fits the bill perfectly.

917864,3,6304680538,"Horror movies of the 50s provide a rich vein for critics to explore the meanings of such often bandied about terms  as 'great', 'awful', 'bad', and 'good.'  Critics like to point at movies such as THE BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS and say on one hand that it is a 'bad' movie, but on the other immediately qualify the 'bad' with a fuzzily defined 'good.'  When critics do that, they suggest that the subjective use of terms normally used to indicate quality or lack of it are not mutually exclusive.
There is much to pan in TBFPA: the cheesy special effects, John Agar's hammy acting, a script not believable even by the slovenly standards of the 50s, and the sexist idea that earth women are desired by offworld species.  But what is it that separates moves like this one from others that offer nothing but an itch in the brain that vanishes the moment that the concluding credits begin to roll?  I suggest that TBFPA is a perfect example of the movie that brings the audience to the very precipice of the gulf that separates momentary fun from a shocking statement that life in our universe and life in a movie exist only to cause pain to the viewer.  Dirctor Nathan Juran presents the viewer with the premise that earth is being invaded by two aliens, a bad one (Gor) and a good one (Val).  Gor lodges himself in the brain of a human, John Agar, who is clearly meant to represent mortal Everyman, exactly the outwardly handsome but inwardly ungiving sort that Shirley Temple did marry in real life.  Val lodges himself in a dog so as to monitor the progress of the invasion.  In a wacky sort of way, TBFPA prefigures a similar concept of good cop bad alien later to appear in I COME IN PEACE. Val successfully foils the invasion by causing a freed John Agar to defeat Gor, who is now able to bob about grinning evilly on some noticeably swinging wires.  Despite the presence of all the shortcomings noted above, TBFPA has the sense not to cross the line that separates fun from a churning in the stomach that inevitably arises when any film disrespects both itself and the audience.  Monstrosities like CALIGULA or I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE work only on crossing this line to exile the audience for the duration of the movie into a world of torment whose only purpose is to remind its captive audience that the power to harm is infinitely preferable than the power to heal.  Good-bad films like TBFPA eternally serve to remind us that the enjoyment of any movie is a function of its staying only on the side of a cinematic chasm that has basic respect for human life and dignity.",1025049600,6,2571,4.505376344086022
917865,4,6304680538,"Gor and Val are alien brains that come to earth. Gor wants to enslave the human race and takes over John Agar's body. Val wants to capture Gor and return him to planet Arous from which he escaped. Val inhabits a dog to be close to Gor. Gor blows up an atomic test site, crisps a couple of people, and destroys a couple of airplanes (the pieces of which hang from their wires afterwards) before his comeuppance. And, of course, Gor has to lust after the female lead. The acting is generally fine and the film exhibits a level of professionalism lacking in a lot of these ""classics"".
This is great B movie fare. And as an extra bonus, the ravine and cave in which Gor and Val are discovered was earlier occupied by that ultimate of alien pests, Ro-man: the alien in a gorilla suit and diver's helmet which appears in Robot Monster, another classic of 1950s sci-fi.
The DVD is of good quality. Details are visible in the shadows and the scenes have good tone throughout. The picture is sharp. A very good transfer to DVD.

917866,5,6304680538,"From the producer (Jacques `Jack' Marquette) and director (Nathan Juran) of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, Brain from Planet Arous (like 50 Foot Woman) has to be one of the top five or ten most entertaining bad films of all time. Apparently Juran was so ashamed of these two movies that he took the pseudonym `Nathan Hertz' as his screen credit. Unlike say, Dick Cunha, Coleman Francis, or Ed Wood's movies, it's not technical incompetence or lack of funds that create the magic here (although those were no doubt factors), but the completely loony, ludicrous script by Ray Buffum (Teenage Monster, Island of Lost Women). John Agar delivers a deadpan, tour de force performance (perhaps matched only by Jack Nicholson in The Shining) as Steve, the alien-possessed hero: relaxed and easygoing one minute, smug and sarcastic, leering lustfully, writhing in agony, or laughing maniacally the next. Joyce Meadows actually emotes quite convincingly as his frightened, confused fiance Sally, and familiar faces Robert (Wagon Train, Laramie) Fuller, and beaky Thomas B. Henry (Beginning of the End, How to Make a Monster, etc.) fill out the `name' cast.  The only evidence of legendary makeup artist Jack Pierce's participation are Agar's silver eyeballs (re-used by Pierce five years later in Creation of the Humanoids). The lecherous (!?) brain itself is a wonderfully silly only-in-the-50s creation, while Agar, laughing psychotically, telepathically destroying chintzy model airplanes, and his climactic showdown with evil alien brain Gor are cheese-lover's delights. The sweat stains, Agar's distorted face in the water cooler, the no-fx alien craft (seen landing behind the opening credits, watch closely), 'good' brain Vol inhabiting Agar's dog, the highly visible wires suspending Gor in the hysterical climax; there are just too many bizarrely precious moments to catalog in a short review like this. If you're a bad film lover this is a must-have.
Image's DVD package is typical of other releases in their Wade Williams Collection. Minimal extras consist of a mediocre-quality `Brain' trailer, 16 chapter stops, nicely designed menus, and five bonus trailers `hidden' in a cookie. The DVD box boasts a ""pristine"" transfer from original source materials. While there is some very light, sporadic speckling and scratching and a few seconds of damaged frames, the print does look terrific otherwise. Very bright and sharp, with excellent grayscale, contrast, and detail. It's probably never gonna get any better than this.

It has more invovled and thoughtful plot than many of the recent movies (enough with the dinos and mummies chasing people around!). In fact, take the plot, update the brains to be ""energy fields"", and you could have a good movie.
In this movie an evil brain (mind) posseses a nuclear scientist. It's objective is not only to take over the world, but to use people to build space craft and attack its own planet. Meanwhile a ""good brain"" arrives instructing the guy's girlfriend on how to deal with the evil that possses her boyfriend. Sort of an alien cops and robbers working through people.
The floating brains aren't the best special effects, but a original idea for the 50s when most monsters are simply people in a man shaped monster suit (heck even today we're still stuck on dinos and mummys going back to the 1930s). The idea of the brains possesing people is good also - sort of a ""you never know what really controls people -id- concept"". And they good against evil concept is timeless.

Young people in the fifties, like young people in every decade, go through periods of alienation. The ""self"" projected at school or work is not always the ""self"" projected at home. Young people are often torn between ego and id when it comes to desires, goals, and ambitions. On the surface the alien possession of John Agar's character is simply another one of those favorite old SF themes. However, as young people often find themselves pulled in different directions when it comes to moral and ethical issues involving everything from sex to drugs so is Agar in this film.
