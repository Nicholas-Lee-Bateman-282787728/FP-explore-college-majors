8520690,5,B002U1DRLQ,"this dvd addresses an important topic for the recovering person.  Namely, having healthy relationships in recovery.  Because certain relationships can often lead a person to use alcohol or drugs, it is important to surround oneself with healthy people in order to have a healthy relationship.  Being able to identify a healthy person is half the battle.

Joe exposes the myth of the hollywood-type relationship that is being fed to people in the movies and through tv and books and how it is based on a fantasy and not reality.  He encourages the viewer to do research and read academic books to learn and know the dynamics of a healthy relationship and how to pursue it.

He examines the commom components of every healthy relationship, such as:  partnership, acceptance, mutual support, and having realistic expectations.

8520692,5,B002U1DRLQ,"I enjoyed watching this because it helped me to think more realistically about how to have a successful relationship, and to not get caught up in expecting that life should mirror what we see in movies and on television, which I think at some level we can buy into.  This also serves to reflect upon childhood influences that can result in relationship perceptions that may be negative.  Whether you're in recovery or not, I recommend this DVD.",1257033600,,444,4.753246753246753
