5998387,1,B00FL02H1E,"If you are into politically correct racist bs, then this is the documentary for you.  I pre-ordered this dvd hoping that it discussed the very early days of Latent Image and the making of NOLD. I was actually hoping for some ""never before released"" behind the scenes photos and stories concerning the making of this tremendous film. Instead, I watched a film totally immersed in racism against blacks during the 60's. Personally, when I first saw this movie in 1968, the issue of race never entered my mind. The movie was a terrifying vision of the living dead that I never saw before. It scared the crap out of me and still does. It is my favorite movie of all time. In my opinion, this documentary does nothing to enhance the value of this movie. Quite the contrary. It twists the narrative to correspond to some racist agenda which I do not accept. On a more positive note, the extras on the disc are worth watching, especially the zombie walk with Zombie #1.",1389052800,4,962,4.5606936416184976

5998399,5,B00FL02H1E,"Birth of the Living Dead (2013)

 Wow, this one provides the kind of fun for fanciers of Zombie films that comes along only once in a great while.  Birth of the Living Dead takes us on a trip in the way-back machine some 45 years into the past to peek into that time that changed Zombies and Zombie movies forever.  This documentary on the making of Night of the Living Dead (1968) has long stretches of George Romero smiling and remembering how the film ever got made and distributed in the first place-not a sure thing even after the finished film rested in the can, ready to go.
 Romero had almost no money to make this now classic and hugely influential film.  He never had enough cash and even during filming had to scrape around for enough money to finish.  Even with repeated shaking of the money tree, the eventual budget came to only $114,000.  Like many low budget films since, many of the cast and crew filled multiple roles.  Many of the cast members were friends and business associates of Romero and his fellow film makers.  Also in keeping with later low budget Zombie films, the actual Zombies were volunteers, people acting as Zombies (and in this case mock eating actual organs and offal).  One bold lady acted as a totally naked Zombie-just for the fun of it.
 Commentary by numerous Zombie film aficionados as well as George himself keep the interviews lively.  The most famous of the speakers is big time Hollywood producer Gail Anne Hurd who has produced such popular films as the first three Terminator films, both Punisher films the amazing and wonderful Armageddon and two Hulk movies.  She has also produced the TV smash hit The Walking Dead and beginning in the summer of 2015 will produce a spin off called Fear of the Walking Dead set in LA.  Other interviewees come from the film and film history communities.  Some of them are so smart that they, in my opinion, read layers of meaning into the work that the originator never intended-but they certainly are smarter than I am, so who knows?
 Zombie film buffs will want to watch this excellent documentary.  Award winning documentary film maker Rob Kuhns directed.  He has a long string of documentaries to his credit.
 Perhaps the most tragic thing about the business side of making this film-without a doubt the most important Zombie film ever made-came about due to a tiny technical error.  The name of the movie changed prior to release and the new and now famous name omitted the little symbol indicating copyrighted material.  Plenty of people made money on the film over the passing decades, but not the talented twenty something film maker, George A. Romero or his talented band.",1431648000,,2667,4.702586206896552

5998401,2,B00FL02H1E,"Could be half as long.  While the interview with George Romero is fascinating, so much of the rest is needless fodder seemingly there to make the film into a feature.  The school teacher and the kids...SO NOT NEEDED.  I just found myself bored.  Which is something Romero himself would never do.

Watch the Romero interviews, then scan though much of the rest.",1404691200,4,360,4.741935483870968

5998403,4,B00FL02H1E,A very excellent documentary on the making of the movie but I have to take away one star because none of the original cast made any appearances in this film. In my opinion the Night of the Living Dead is a masterpiece and I would have liked to have heard from the actors and actresses who are still alive and get their take on the making of this film.  That's the only gripe I have about this documentary; other than that it was excellent!,1402704000,2,439,4.226190476190476
5998404,3,B00FL02H1E,"Often, D.V.D. releases of movies include a ""The making of"" extra that you may either find interesting or turn off after a few minutes.  The 2013 documentary BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD, which tells the story of the 1968 film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, is a making-of that's good enough to merit its own separate release, as opposed to being tucked in with a deluxe reissue of that horror flick.  Building the narrative around new interviews with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD writer-director George Romero, BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD delivers bet-you-didn't-know-that anecdotes and scenes from the groundbreaking film, not shorting the viewer on either.  If you have yet to see NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, please note that this documentary gives away its ironic ending.

Speaking of endings, don't turn off BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD as its closing credits roll.  As if the filmmakers could hear you calling for an encore, before the final fade to black you'll see what became of Bill Heinzman, who played perhaps the most famous zombie in movie history.",1401926400,,1039,4.8474576271186445
5998405,4,B00FL02H1E,"This is the documentary about the original zombie film from 1968 which is the iconic film of the genre, and has spawned about
a zillion imitations, some serious, others silly, some totally over the top, but none that come even close to the original ""Night
of the Living Dead"".  Perhaps not as deep as some would have liked, I found this documentary interesting, as it showed how
the film almost didn't get finished, and how the cast was chosen, and some of the features that made this so successful, once
it was finished, and what made it so unique.  Lots of footage of the original.  NLD was truly the most terrifying horror sci-fi film
ever made, unlike any of it's imitators IMO.  I was 30 when I first saw it in 1971, and while it had some funny moments and lines, I was
never more intensely frightened than by the opening cemetery scene, and especially liked the emphasis on group psychology when
confronted by a harrowing crisis, and the fact that the viewer learns what is happening as the people under siege learn, thus
we are never ahead of the participants.  The documentary points out the fact that the star was black, at a time when that
was unusual, but no attempt was made to focus on it.",1399161600,,1202,4.495412844036697

5998409,4,B00FL02H1E,"This is NOT a documentary on the making of the film, so if you want to see interview clips of all the surviving actors and whatnot, you'd be better off watching the extras on the countless DVD releases of the film. BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD takes a much different approach, more from a cultural and critical perspective, analyzing the impact of the film at its time... and since. All aspects are touched on in this documentary, as to what was going on in the world at the time - the racial tensions, the Vietnam war, etc. Romero has frequently admitted that much of that was unintended during filming, but that does not reduce the social relevance of the film today. Romero is on hand and is always candid with his information and recollections, and other critics, historians also voice in. Usually I would steer clear of a film that takes an historian approach, where most of the talking heads weren't involved in the film, but this is a rare case where it really works perfectly. I've seen NOTLD a million times (the first time at a drive-in at age 10 in 1971 - which changed MY life), and I expected to be watching just another boring retread of Russo or whoever recollecting details of the shoot and so forth.  But that is not the case with BIRTH OF THE LIVING DEAD.  This documentary made me all excited about the film again, making me remember how exciting and horrifying it was for me back in 1971 and the many times I watched it after that - I even bought and owned the full film w/sound on 8mm (very expensive) to show friends in the mid 70's! Those were PRIMITIVE days folks! NOTLD had a HUGE impact back then to movie or horror buffs, something that may not be as easily understood today where everything and anything is at your fingertips with the swipe of a mouse. The BIRTH of NOTLD started not only with its creator(s), but also with its audience. And that's what this film shows.  Excellent!",1393286400,7,1906,4.471264367816092
5998410,4,B00FL02H1E,"George Romero's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00005Y6Y2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;is one of the most influential, independently-produced films of all time. Not only did it create a new horror genre that's lurched resolutely forward for more than fifty years, its transformation of low-budget constraints into story-telling assets is a template that's been reused throughout the world of filmmaking. Romero's semi-professional and amateur cast and crew, improvised effects and black & white film stock all contributed to an unrehearsed, reportorial feel that gave the film's overt horror an even deeper psychological edge. And if that was all there was to the film, it would still stand tall in the horror canon; but there was much more to be found beneath the shockingly gory surface.

Night of the Living Dead was both a product and reflection of its times: the social upheavals amid which it was made, the city that rallied behind its hometown production, and the world into which the film was released. First Run Features' 78-minute documentary explores the film's production and the commercial and social milieus in which it was created. Threaded throughout are clips from a 2006 interview with Romero and commentary from a number of filmmakers and critics. An additional 33-minutes of interview footage is included as a bonus feature, augmented by an extraordinary 10-minute audience Q&A from a 1970 showing of the film at the New York Museum of Modern Art. The bonuses are rounded out with a short report on a world-record-breaking zombie walk at the same Monroeville mall at which Romero made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B0002IQNAG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>. The latter includes a short conversation with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie-1/dp/B007NC2NG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie #1</a>, Bill Hinzman.

The documentary starts with Romero's early career producing shorts for television's Mr. Rogers (sadly, ""Mr. Rogers Gets a Tonsilectomy,"" is not excerpted), and ads for beer and soap. His production company, The Latent Image, built their way up to the 35mm equipment that was used to make NOTLD, his first full-length film. Romero initially tried to peddle a script for a Bergmanesque art film, but failing to find investors he turned to the more commercial genre of horror. Inspired equally by Richard Matheson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/031286504X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;(which had been turned into the 1964 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B000WC3A0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>) and the angry discontent brewing at home and in Vietnam, the 27-year-old Romero and his partner John Russo crafted a bleak picture of a country literally devouring itself in gustatory revolution.

Amid the inspirations of the times, one might think Duane Jones' casting as the film's lead (and the story's most capable and steady character) was some sort of counterculture reaction to or comment on the racial tensions of the times. But it turns out that Jones was selected solely for his classically-trained acting skill, and featured as a character whose race was never an element of the plot. Though his placement was quite revolutionary, the script was written before his casting, and the lack off issue with his skin color turned out to be a lens through which the film was viewed, rather than a purposeful statement by the filmmakers. As in several other respects, the film gained context from its era without necessarily drawing from it directly.

Filming in and around Pittsburgh, Romero assembled a cadre of semi-professional and amateur actors and technicians. A new production company, Image 10, was formed to finance the film, and several of the investors (and Latent Image's advertising clients) appeared in the film or served in technical roles. Romero drew upon the Pittsburgh community for help, pulling in local acting talent, police (and their dogs) and even a news station's helicopter. Bill ""Chilly Billy"" Cardille, the host of Chiller Theater appeared as a newsman in the film, and one of the film's investors, who had a day job as a meatpacker, provided the animal parts used in the gore sequences. The documentary reveals that many of the actors played multiple roles and served in technical capacities; Marilyn Eastman, for example, played the mother Helen Cooper, a bug-eating ghoul, and served as the film's make-up artist.

An hour into the documentary, the analysis turns to the film's release and public reception. Wrapping in late 1967, it wasn't until Spring 1968 that Romero went shopping for distributors. Carrying ""an angry 60s film with a black lead,"" shot by an unknown, Pittsburgh-based production company, in black and white, on a budget of only $100,000, in a film genre whose box office had been slipping, Romero had no luck with Columbia, AIP or other major distributors. The film was eventually picked up by the Walter Reade Organization (who re-titled the film from ""Night of the Flesh Eaters"" and inadvertently lost its copyright) and released to theaters, drive-ins and grindhouses. Critics, including Vincent Canby and Roger Ebert, failed to understand the film and trashed it in their reviews. Still, the film did well enough to be selected ""Exploitation Picture of the Month"" by the National Association of Theater Owners.

The film got a more public boost when a 1969 re-release resulted in an interview with George Romero in Andy Warhol's Inter/view, and praise in France's Positif. The film was shown at New York's Museum of Modern Art in June 1970, and a 10 minute audio Q&A with the audience finds Romero giddy with the acceptance his film had finally found. Romero is a lively and interesting interview subject, and though the additional commentary from assorted filmmakers, screenwriters and critics is interesting, it would have been even more interesting to hear from other surviving members of the film's cast and crew. The film's Pittsburgh birth and improbably huge (and long-lasting) impact are great stories, but grounding NOTLD's ethos in the anger, radical politics and violence of the late '60s is this documentary's most surprising revelation.

So innapropriate, but why are they even there?

Well, they are  students of a creep named Christopher Cruz who teaches in NY and as part of his curriculum, actually has these young, inner city kids WATCH THIS MOVIE. We are even treated to clips of the kids reacting as they watch the victims getting their intestines devoured. ""EEEWWW...That's GUTS!!"" Can you imagine when we live in a time when kids are so desensitized to violence that some teacher would make a point of having them sit down and watch this movie? Imagine them watching the daughter devouring daddy, then stabbing mom to death with the trowel.

Now, I've always been a huge liberal, and a horror fan who despises censorship. But, you also need some level of common sense. It makes me sick when I watch the culture's obsession with zombies being thrust onto the kids. (Like on the web I've seen a dad dressed as a zombie with his 2 toddlers on leashes, both made up as bloody littlle zombies Awwww, how cute-not). When the kids are old enough, fine, zombie away. But showing them this movie in grammar school is so inappropriate I can't believe this moron Cruz is allowed to teach. How are these kids going to develop a healthy respect for human life,so that years later they can enjoy brutal horror if the like, but  separate horror from reality?

While there are indeed some interesting nuggets of information on the making of Night of the Living Dead the real purpose of this film seems to be squarely focused on the race angle of having a black male lead in a time period where segregation and rioting over race relations was a daily occurrence.  While that topic absolutely deserves addressing in any documentary about Night of the Living Dead the filmmakers concentrate solely on this, using footage from other racially charged films of the era such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and The Defiant Ones to shore up their point of view.

Fans of Night of the Living Dead will find no new content on the making of that film.  Other than an interview with George Romero who tells his usual familiar tales there's nothing of interest whatsoever.  No behind the scenes footage or stills, no outtakes or deleted scenes (which were all presumed lost in a flood decades ago - and they don't even tell THAT story) and no interviews with anybody involved in the actual production of Night of the Living Dead other than Romero himself.
