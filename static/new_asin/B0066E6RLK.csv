4962062,5,B0066E6RLK,I was glad to find this on DVD.  I enjoyed the mini-series.  Andie Dickinson was very good in the role of the colonel's wife and you could sympathize with her.  Dennis Weaver as Colonel Forrest gave a excellent performance.  The scenery of Hawaii was beautiful and the battle scenes were well done.  Enjoyed it.,1477699200,,311,4.685185185185185

4962065,4,B0066E6RLK,"A GREAT TV movie (1978) and now available on DVD! Saw it in 78' when first televised - stellar cast; kind of has shades of ""From Here To Eternity (1954) plot line though.",1470268800,,170,4.181818181818182
4962066,5,B0066E6RLK,"We love the mini-series.  We were stationed at Ft. Shafter, Hawaii when the mini-series was filmed and we saw several of the actors and some of the scenes being filmed.",1468800000,,168,4.6

4962085,3,B0066E6RLK,"Had a few too many cuts and slices from Tora Tora Tora, not all timely. Had good star power.",1453507200,,92,3.8947368421052633
4962086,4,B0066E6RLK,"Interesting movie, great price!",1452384000,,31,7.0
4962087,1,B0066E6RLK,"Bad writing with soporific plot wrapped around pearl harbor. The japanese scenes and the attack were taken from the movie Tora, Tora, Tora with a change in the audio. As a fan of that movie it is used badly here ruining the effect of the scenes. A better melodrama to watch about pearl harbor is the movie Pearl Harbor done several years ago with Josh Hartnett. It was done much better as far as plot and acting. Skip this.
P.s. The recording was defective too.",1450742400,,461,4.435294117647059

4962091,3,B0066E6RLK,"Fairly good story, although the attack scenes were mostly from the Hollywood version of Pearl Harbor, and continued throughout nearly the entire movie interspersed between the non-combat scenes.
What was in actuality a two something hour long attack, the attack in this version lasted the entire long long movie.

Dennis Weaver stole the show, being a really egotistically sick career, vs service to his country, officer.  The only disappointment was he lived even to the rolling of the credits.",1437350400,,495,5.253164556962025
4962095,5,B0066E6RLK,Angie is great.... Denis is a real bad guy!,1437350400,,43,3.888888888888889
4962096,5,B0066E6RLK,Good mini series about Pearl Harbor. Great acting as well!,1436486400,,58,4.9
4962097,5,B0066E6RLK,One of my favorite mini-series.  I love seeing all the sites on Oahu before the hotels went up in Waikiki.  And the cast worked so well together to make this mini-series interesting and enjoyable.,1433808000,,196,4.735294117647059

4962115,5,B0066E6RLK,"This was a little ripper, similar story to many others about Pearl Harbour but Angie Dickinson and her fellow ladies were superb.  The story was good and the acting very good.  I am sure we will watch again sometime in the near future.",1417651200,,235,4.441860465116279
4962116,4,B0066E6RLK,"Ok, a TV series from the late 70's. And about Pearl Harbor. Yes, the perspective is a bit off but the acting is more entertaining than in similar series of the time.",1411689600,,165,4.1875
4962117,3,B0066E6RLK,fair made for tv series now on dvd. good actors,1409961600,,47,3.8
4962118,5,B0066E6RLK,"Another good mini series with a stellar cast.  Angie Dickinson in the lead role.  There were so many stories that had to be told in this movie that it took  2 nights to tell it.  Then Pearl Harbor was attacked and all of their lives were changed forever.

Worth watching with a good bowl of popcorn one night.",1409270400,,309,4.258620689655173

4962120,2,B0066E6RLK,Tried to put too much into two discs,1406678400,,36,3.625
4962121,3,B0066E6RLK,"Loved the series!  A lot of it was filmed at Scofield Barracks in Hawaii -- some of it at the 25th Infantry Division Non Commissioned Officer's Academy.  I was the Director of the Primary NCO course and along with other Academy Staff, I was an extra in the film (the guy beating the foot lockers during Reville and a couple of other minor parts).

However, the disc failed and I was only able to watch the first disc.  Sent it back and Amazon refunded my money.  It would have been nice to have a functional disc - Grand-kids would have enjoyed seeing Papa Dean with all the movie stars!",1406592000,4,587,4.348623853211009
4962122,5,B0066E6RLK,"Excellent story. I would say it's the best Pearl Harbour story next to Tora! tora! tora! which was a sort of documentary film about that event. Very accurate, and the story line is well done as well as the performances. Absolutely satisfied.",1405036800,,241,4.761904761904762
4962123,5,B0066E6RLK,"I had seen this before and enjoyed it very much.  The reason I ordered it is because I felt my grandchildren could learn something from it.  It is a little softer than a ""war movie"" and they can get the human effect from such a film.",1402272000,,233,4.043478260869565
4962124,5,B0066E6RLK,"I chose this rating because the actors were real.  I especially liked Robert and Wagner and Leslie Ann Warren.
Angie Dickinson was great.",1398729600,8,137,4.956521739130435

4962144,5,B0066E6RLK,I enjoyed this movie with my husband & we both enjoy it a lot. I would  tell some military people to buy this move & my friends. I think very one should watch this movie.,1393545600,2,170,3.857142857142857
4962145,3,B0066E6RLK,"I had to watch part one and then skip to part three. Part two was nothing more than a blank screen.
I had to twice smear Murhpy's clean and dust formula with Anti-static ingredient on the disc, Then I used a hair dryer and the heat from a 100 watt bulb to bake the oil into the disc. I then ran the disc twice back and forward through my DVD player.
This treatment worked 100%. Sometimes it only works 80%.

As for the story and the acting it was 5 star excellent, especially Angie Dickison, who was 6 star excellent.",1391644800,3,517,4.17
4962146,5,B0066E6RLK,I love this Mini Series.  Great stars and a different perspective of that horrible day in December.  Story line is very good too.,1389052800,,129,4.565217391304348
4962147,5,B0066E6RLK,I was an extra in the movie. Had lunch every day with the actors. Fell in love with Leslie Ann waren. I was only 19 yrs old at the time. One time at  lunch I was asked by  r.j. Robert Wagner if I knew who the woman sitting across from me was. I said sorry no I don't . He smiled and said she is my wife. Natalie wood. So you can stop starting at her.

4962148,4,B0066E6RLK,"I had this movie before on VHS and I am just replacing it.  The movie is slow to develop, but they are trying to cover 4 or 5 stories in this mini-series.  I love old war movies and just wanted it for my collection.  It is one movie that I will watch again, as I do enjoy watching this movie.",1383350400,,292,3.8333333333333335

8493885,2,B0066E6RLK,"I was seriously disappointed. The DVD was a DVD RW, and it wasn't advertised as such.  It can't be played on a laptop or PC, just a Blu Ray or DVD player.",1493337600,,154,3.8125
