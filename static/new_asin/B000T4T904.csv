Volume: DVD 6
Running time: 100
All good things must come to an end... Or must they? Maybe not if you're a part of the Best Student Council!

Sometimes, a girl can lead a perfectly happy double life that nobody knows about - that is, until some pesky busybodies start snooping around. Sneaky! Other times, the most-popular girl of all could just decide to leave school suddenly. No way! But not so fast sweetie-pie. This girl must have forgotten that the Best Student Council is ""maximum authority wielding"" and will fight to get her back from wherever she is. Hurrah! And that one of her sillier friends is actually quite powerful because of her constant puppet companion. Who knew?! Sometimes the end is really a start of a new beginning.
