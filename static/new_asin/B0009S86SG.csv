8066026,5,B0009S86SG,"If you feel disconnected at Christmas--not invited into the spirituality, sentimentality?  Then enjoy its blasphemous side with Miss Richfield.  I do wish the that production had been a bit more professional: at times the sound is just not what it should be. But if you're indifferent about Christmas, you'll enjoy finding lack of meaning in this brilliant show.",1206748800,,362,5.224137931034483

I had the honor and extreme pleasure of seeing Miss Richfield perform at a birthday party in Colorado for our friends. Truly one of the best and funniest nights ever!

Just when you think there's nothing new under the sun (or under the table...) Miss Richfield breezes in an just blows you away with some of the finest and most inventive dynamic comedy you'll EVER come across!

Whether she's playing a wilting virtuoso offering on her hand saw or standing on her head and... and... and... (NO! You just have to *SEE IT* to FULLY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE IT!) you will wonder why TV executives and major film studios are not crawling on their hands and knees to her trailer park with contracts in hand.

Don't just sit there. BUY THIS NOW and share Miss Richfield with your friends!",1182038400,,820,4.63448275862069

8066029,5,B0009S86SG,"If you're a fan of PEE WEE'S CHRISTMAS SPECIAL or A TUNA CHRISTMAS, you'll howl over this consistently hilarious recording of Miss Richfield 1981 live in concert, performing her Christmas Spectacular. This is a camp classic!",1134432000,5,224,5.25
