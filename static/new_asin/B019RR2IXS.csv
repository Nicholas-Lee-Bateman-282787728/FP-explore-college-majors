7581143,5,B019RR2IXS,"Every disc works perfectly. I'm sure there are many other reviews saying how great of a show it is, so I will just say that I agree (but you have to watch Avatar: The Last Airbender first).",1535328000,,189,4.135135135135135

7581146,5,B019RR2IXS,Enjoying the series.  Like the Avatar story line.,1534636800,,49,5.125
7581147,5,B019RR2IXS,"I actually never gave this a chance since when it first came out reviews said it was different than The Last Airbender.  Yes, it is different, but it's really good.",1534550400,,164,4.466666666666667
7581148,4,B019RR2IXS,"Series is great. However, was sent faulty discs that skip every so often. Same thing happened to the Blu Ray versions of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Buy with caution.",1534291200,,166,4.758620689655173

7581152,2,B019RR2IXS,"Being a fan of Avatar: the last Airbender. I ordered Legend of Korra for my kids to watch, not realizing that in the last season, the main character, Korra, turns out to be a lesbian and gets together with another woman character, Asami.  I think something like this should be listed in the description, just as a warning for people who don't really want to watch this with their kids. just sayin ",1533859200,,397,4.5
7581153,5,B019RR2IXS,"I absolutely loved Avatar: The Last Airbender, and this show has turned out to be just as good. The story and character writing is deep and excellent. I would argue that, violence aside, this and Avatar are two of the most genuinely wholesome shows to air in the 21st century.",1533859200,,276,4.54
7581154,4,B019RR2IXS,"Great show, watched it with my kids, the action is amazing. Book three of the show was our favorite.",1533859200,,100,4.315789473684211
7581155,4,B019RR2IXS,"The actual media arrived and plays, but the top of the case is a bit shattered.",1533600000,,79,4.0
7581156,1,B019RR2IXS,Arrived broken. Im super bummed out that the whole case is shattered.  The DVDs are fine but the case and box are entirely smashed to pieces.,1533600000,,141,4.423076923076923
7581157,5,B019RR2IXS,"An amazing, wholesome, and groundbreaking show. Absolutely amazing.",1533513600,,67,7.5
7581158,4,B019RR2IXS,The series is amazing!  I adore Korra. But the case is flimsy.  It opens way too easily and I've had discs sliding around more than once. Not great when this is your daughter's favorite series,1533340800,,192,4.457142857142857
7581159,4,B019RR2IXS,Great quality good special features the main menu is good and shows you future episodes in that season. Besides it being legends of korra its worth purchasing,1533254400,,158,4.888888888888889

7581165,5,B019RR2IXS,"I saw this one before ATLAB, and had no problem at all understanding anything. It was because I liked this one so much that I got the previous series.",1532390400,,150,4.206896551724138
7581166,5,B019RR2IXS,A great series with great characters and fantastic cinematography. The martial arts are well shown and the fight choreography is on point! Also the villains in each season give Korra alot to lose and are up to the challenge of taking down the Avatar. Also you get a deeper look into the Avatars past which allows you to see how The Avatar came to be. I especially love how well they tied in the original series characters into this story without overshadowing the main cast.,1532304000,,474,4.588235294117647
7581167,5,B019RR2IXS,"Great show and glad to finally have all of it in one collection! Discs and plastic case were flawless, but the outer cardboard slip sleeve was a little dented around the edges. Not a major concern for me, but fyi.",1531958400,,213,4.35
7581168,5,B019RR2IXS,"One of the most engaging saga ever told in an anime series. It's a western and eastern hybrid of culture which makes for a compelling narrative and ethos of morality. They nail the 3 pillars of a good story. Plot, Characters, and Lore. They nail all three with a high dimension and sophistication not even found in movies intended for adults. It's a mature subject matter that is well balanced in gender, political views, hero and villain, realistic scenarios. Anyone will come out of watching intently a bit wiser than before because it allegorically puts perspective on matters we face now and in history.",1531872000,3,607,4.846153846153846

7581171,5,B019RR2IXS,Great series wow. Love everything about the Avatar series and The Legend of Korra does NOT disappoint its equal to Avatar if not BETTER! There are some ads on this before the title screen which can be annoying but whatever. Also a cardboard sleeve would have been cool for the disc case,1531094400,,286,4.519230769230769
7581172,5,B019RR2IXS,"Put in a disk and hit ""Play All"" and there goes your day, just gotta skip through the TMNT ads at the beginning of each season (thankfully, the TMNT ads aren't on disk 2 of any season, that I noticed.)",1531094400,,201,4.05

7581176,3,B019RR2IXS,"Fantastic. Mine is missing a disc.

Serves me right for not inspecting the package when I got it. I just now got around to opening this after ordering it two months ago, and I notice my set has Two ""Book Three: Change, Disc One""s. I'm missing half of Book Two.

As this was a brand new item, It's not Amazon's fault. Unfortunately, Amazon provides no recourse for orders over 30 days old, so I guess that was money down the drain.",1530748800,,430,4.296296296296297

7581180,5,B019RR2IXS,I hated when this series was pulled of the air. I am thrilled to finally see the resolution to the series.,1530230400,,106,4.095238095238095
7581181,1,B019RR2IXS,Horrible disk appears new in box but scratched.,1530230400,2,47,5.0
7581182,2,B019RR2IXS,Half of the discs were scratched!!! It would cut out at some of the most important scenes. Definitely returning my order. Very displeased.,1530230400,,138,5.043478260869565
7581183,5,B019RR2IXS,Definitely worth the blu ray,1530057600,,28,4.8

7581185,5,B019RR2IXS,"I think that this was a pretty good sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender. There were a few flaws here and there, but no show is perfect. I know that most people didn't like season two. I didn't really mind season two, and there were some problems with it, but it didn't make me not want to watch it anymore. Now, I think that Korra was a really good Avatar. I know that she can be very headstrong, but she learned a lot during her ordeals, and she has been through so much that you just feel for her. Really good show.",1529971200,,518,4.088235294117647

7581187,3,B019RR2IXS,"The 3-star review is really for the content of the DVD set. I love the entire series, and Ive always felt it was at least as good as the original series. Upon exploration, however, Ive discovered that there are no subtitles included as an option. It seems so unreal for them to be missing at this day and age. This function may not be as important to others, but its important to me for several reasons.",1529625600,,403,4.315789473684211

7581190,1,B019RR2IXS,"This show is great, but for the SECOND TIME time I was sent a defective set! 4/8 disks did not work with my blue-ray player. This is quite unacceptable. I will try for one more replacement before I ask for a full refund. In conclusion the show gets 5 stars, but the quality control gets a big fat ZERO!",1529193600,4,302,4.135593220338983

7581208,5,B019RR2IXS,Great continuation of the original Avatar story. Very binge-worthy.,1525392000,,67,6.555555555555555
7581209,5,B019RR2IXS,"I absolutely love this show. I loved Avatar the last air bender but after watching this, I put this one above the last air bender. The show is more mature, presents a strong and sensible hero and actually tackles adult issues about relationships so what is not to love?
I wish Nick didn't make the life so difficult for the creators that they could have made this awesome show more awesome. Kudos to them for pulling this off spectacularly and shame on Nick. The comic book series continues with what we would have got and so I have no regrets.",1524960000,,544,4.45
7581210,5,B019RR2IXS,"Its a great series, maybe not as good as the first avatar. But I love how it deals with more serious matters.
The packaging came out fine no tears or dents. The only thing that was wrong was one of the disc was loose when I opened it, but luckily it wasn't  scratched.",1524528000,,268,4.056603773584905

7581213,5,B019RR2IXS,"Terrific series. Had it on DVD but with Avatar: The Last Airbender being released on Blu-ray this summer, it only made sense to get this one on Blu-ray as well",1524355200,,159,4.333333333333333
7581214,5,B019RR2IXS,Great addition to my collection,1523836800,,31,5.4

7581218,5,B019RR2IXS,"I love the series. I loved catching up with the characters from Avatar the Last Airbender. This series will keep you on your toes. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get mad, and then you will feel relieved.",1523491200,,205,4.5675675675675675
7581219,4,B019RR2IXS,Solid show and would have been better of the Last Airbender didn't do it better first. but wanted to buy this to support the animated creators,1523232000,,142,4.5
7581220,1,B019RR2IXS,"Honestly I can't be sure if it's good or not because for some ridiculous reason it's full on HDCP protected. I guess that's fine for some people, but for those of us with older equipment it's not. I'll have to spend at least as much again on cables to even see if my TV or monitor will work, which there is a good chance that they won't due to the weird inconsistent nature of HDCP licensing.",1523145600,2,392,4.171052631578948
7581221,4,B019RR2IXS,"The show is great, the box set is incredibly well priced.  The Bluray disks have some irritating quirks though.  For starters while my blu-ray player remembers where I left off with almost every Bluray I play in it, it doesn't with these disks, so if I'm marathoning over a couple days I have to find where I was every time I start the player.  And just to make it worse, some (though not all) of the disks are preloaded with unskipable advertisements for Ninja Turtles, so not only do I have to find where I was every time I start the player, I also have to watch the same annoying trailer.

Still, while that is very irritating the show itself is awesome, and as well as this box set is priced I suppose I can tolerate the irritation.  If I could go back in time and choose whether or not to buy this, I'd definitely still buy it.",1522800000,9,832,4.2405063291139244

7581223,5,B019RR2IXS,This show isn't as good the show off which it is based (Avatar the Last Airbender) but it is pretty good. I had no issues with this purchase and the product came in new condition.,1522540800,,179,4.142857142857143

7581225,1,B019RR2IXS,"Amazing show. This review does not reflect the show, the show is a 5 Star masterpiece. The 1 Star is because the product arrived to me smashed to in multiple pieces. Its broken and I would love a new one. If the seller could contact me thatd be helpful. Thank you.",1521763200,3,264,4.196078431372549
7581226,5,B019RR2IXS,"A great series, good for boys, girls, teenagers, really any age group/gender. the writers did a great job in the story line, so it can entertain kids as well as adults. Teaches good life lessons as well, like the last airbender series (the whole team who created this are just fantastic, good plots, animations, dialogue, etc) My only complaint would be the actual product. when you buy this, you get all the disks, but thats it, you don't get anything that came with the purchase of an individual season. just the CD's. Other than that its great! video on the CD's are high quality too.",1521763200,,587,4.6
7581227,5,B019RR2IXS,I absolutely love the avatar series. Great price for a cartoon series that is worth watching over and over again.,1521763200,,113,4.7

7581236,5,B019RR2IXS,What can I say. I never thought the follow up series to ATLA would come close but they really outdid themselves. Korra is a strong female lead in an amazing adventure series. All the old story lines and characters return and it's most definitely worth watching!,1520467200,,261,4.695652173913044

7581239,5,B019RR2IXS,"Just and astounding show. Every episode is superbly animated. The drama is high along with the stakes. They do a great job of introducing us to new characters while giving us connections to the old ones. It is a timeless story about politics and class.

7581257,5,B019RR2IXS,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is, in my opinion, one of the greatest animated television shows of all time. It has entertained not only children, but adults for over a decade with its stunning animation, beautiful music, strong story, and well-developed characters. It was a landmark in television animation for not only being a great show that appealed to seemingly everyone, but for also being a wonderful blend of western and eastern animation  its not technically an anime because it is not a Japanese cartoon, but the influence was obvious from the start. Due to the series receiving high praise throughout and after its run, there was some doubt about whether a sequel series could be on the same level, especially since the focus would be on different characters in a different setting. Was lightning able to strike twice for the makers of these shows? Yes, yes it was.

 First off, the animation is fantastic. Avatar was produced a decade ago and although it has held up extraordinarily well, it is a show made before the HD-era. Korra fully takes advantage of the benefits of an HD screen, with beautiful backgrounds and wonderfully choreographed fights that keep you on the edge of your seats. There are multiple times throughout the show where you just sit back and think to yourself, Wow, this is beautiful. The original show also had some great fights throughout the series and this new show steps everything up, with more fluid animation and different techniques for the characters, including the widespread use of metal-bending (courtesy of Toph). This all being said, not every frame in the show is a Da Vinci masterpiece, as there are some times where you wonder how a certain scene got to the final product, but as a whole, its stunning. It makes me remember why I prefer 2D-animation to 3D-animation. But enough of the animation, what about the story and characters?

Thankfully, the characters are great, too. At points, you might find yourself getting a little annoyed with how certain characters act and certain love quadrilaterals that play out, but neither of these problems hold down entire episodes. I cant say for certain that the new Team Avatar (and I love that they call themselves that) is better than the original, but I grew to love the hardened bad boy Mako, the lovable Bolin, the intelligent Asami, and the determined Korra. The side characters are also great, with Tenzin (Aangs youngest son who happens to be an airbender) being one of my personal favorites  once I found out that J.K. Simmons voices him, I only loved him more. Varrick, who is introduced in the second season with his assistant (Zhu Li), later became my favorite character of the show not only for his wonderful comedic timing, but also for his eccentricity and mad genius attributes, along with his mentor-like relationship with Bolin (I also loved his in-universe film, The Adventures of Nuktuk: Hero of the South). Even the villains are good, with Amon (the first big baddie) being my personal favorite, followed by Zaheer, and Kuvira. The only villain that I didn't really like was Unalaq (he wasn't very compelling), but even then, I didn't hate him and his children were great characters. As far as characters go, this show has almost no characters that I hate, if any at all  they did a superb job at creating a great cast of characters throughout the entire run.

 As far as the story goes, its also really good. Season 1 does a great job of setting the world up and making it feel alive by having the Equalists (a terrorist group opposed to benders) as the primary villains, while Season 2 does some fancy stuff with the spirit world that gets a little out there (especially with the ending fight), but again, its not bad. Season 3 is probably my favorite season because it has a good villain, even better action (the choreography and Jeremy Zuckermans music continue to impress me), and a fantastic finale. Season 4 continues the trend and shows what happens after the huge climax of the previous season, while also setting up the final seasons villains and plot very well. Unlike Avatar, which had one overarching story, with most episodes having their own plot as well, this show has a different story for each season, but most episodes continue right where the last one left off. This is neither good nor bad (it makes it harder to rewatch just one or two episodes, but it makes it far more addicting and provides great hooks), but I appreciate the different approach to storytelling. For me, I was very pleased with how the story was handled.

 Before I close this review, I thought that I would just give a few more thoughts on tidbits that I liked and didn't like. Firstly, I love the Previously on The Legend of Korra... segments, as they are narrated by a fast-talking sports commentator and filmed with a silent-era picture quality  it is extremely amusing and visually appealing. Secondly, while I very much loved the shows animation, it does use 3D animation every now-and-then and while its not overly distracting or terrible, I would be lying if I said it wasn't a little. Thirdly, the end of Season 1 is a total deus ex machina with a rushed resolution. I cant say anything else without spoiling it, but I wasn't a fan of it (although the rest of the finale was still great). Lastly, I thought that I would just give a very brief list of some episodes that stick out in my head for being particularly good (these aren't necessarily the best or even my favorite, but just an example or two from each season): Skeletons in the Closet (S1E11) has a fantastic flashback sequence for most of the episode that makes Amon an even better villain than he already was and is the point in the show where my mouth dropped; Beginnings (S2E7-8) is a two-part episode that explains the origins of the first Avatar, Wan, and uses its own unique art style that helps it stand out from the series, while also telling a compelling story in its own right; the last three episodes of Season 3 are fantastic together as a whole, with the first episode showing Tenzins determination to save his family and the last episode (Venom of the Red Lotus) providing a very strong conclusion for the season that makes you question where certain characters will go from here (and it includes a great aerial battle between Korra and Zaheer); Korra Alone (S4E2) is about Korras healing process, both mentally and physically, and as someone who has had numerous surgeries, I can say that this episode was very realistic and probably the most true-to-life episode of the series; and lastly, the fantastic finale that does a great job of wrapping everything up.

 Thats about everything that I wanted to say about the series. In a nutshell, its fantastic and any fan of the original show owes it to him/herself to give this one a watch. Is it as good as the original? Well, I don't think that is a fair question because of how good the original is, but I supposed that I would have to say no. Despite all the strengths of this show (and there are a lot), nothing in this show is as good as Zukos story arc or his relationship with Iroh (which I consider to be the best part of Avatar), but it is still amazing and I would recommend it to any fan of the original. Now, if we could just get the creators to make a spinoff show about Nuktuk...",1515196800,4,7329,4.680900621118012

7581359,4,B019RR2IXS,"I'll say upfront I'm not a fan of steampunk and Legend of Korra has steampunk elements. I find that too often the technology is more magic than tech and at times it may not blend in well with other elements in the world. I also found the first season a little rough. So I watched this show at first with some caution and a healthy dose of skepticism. However, it soon won me over with its well plotted seasons, its overall very good voice acting and the character growth of the main character Korra. The stakes got to be quite high in several of the seasons and I think the creators were smart to aim this at a older demographic namely people who had grown up with the original Avatar series.

Currently I think the show is at a good price for 4 seasons of content. Plus you also get some decent on disc extras. Visually it looks very sharp most of the time. There were 1-2 scenes that I noticed some dropped frames but that looked like it was in the original materials not do to the blu-ray authoring. I did get a bad disc (the last one of course) which required me to send my copy back and get a new one which is always annoying. I wish that they had done more with the packaging, I would have been happy to pay more. There's no disc art its all the same baby blue color, yuck. The little booklet would have been great if it had been the size of the rest of the package. And it would have been nice if they could have done something a little creative or given us a solid box for the set.

I think this is a good solid show worthy of support and a purchase. I could definitely handle more Korra or another Avatar show perhaps set in more modern times.",1492646400,2,1652,4.1433021806853585

7581362,5,B019RR2IXS,"Honestly this was just too good a deal to pass up.

7581373,5,B019RR2IXS,"This is an amazing show. You don't NEED to watch the Avatar: The Last Airbender series to enjoy this, but you will get more out of it if you have seen it. We bought this box set as the final season wasn't available to stream free with Prime (the first 3 seasons are, as is the full Avatar series at the time I'm writing this review!) It's more mature than the Avatar series, so keep in mind that very little kids might not find it as enjoyable.

There are 2 discs per season, and although so far I've only tested out the season 4 discs, they work well. I decided to write a review because I wanted to mention that they DO NOT have a subtitle track (at least for season 4, but I assume for all of them) so if you rely on subtitles to watch a show/movie, you won't be able to use this box set.

As far as cost this is a no brainer. While seasons 1-3 were free on Prime, Amazon wants $30 for just the season 4 stream alone but all 4 seasons on Bluray for $30 yeah that's way better!",1489104000,3,487,4.247311827956989

7581398,4,B019RR2IXS,"EDIT: After just 2 days we received our replacement disk set and noticed a Major change, All disks worked beautifully with no errors and was a delight to watch and finally be able to finish the series. We adore the Legend of Korra and this disk set makes watching marathons easy as pressing play. Even though the disks play and run fluently when we first received the replacement it was a bit of a disappointment when we opened the case as the middle section that connects all the disk holders where NOT in place and one tiny part was even broken, at first we where quite worried about the disks considering that the disk holders would have been bumming and moving around but the disks where fine and the small broken piece is an easy super glue fix. All in all good product and glad we gave it a second chance.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  The first disk (season 4 disk 1) that my family watched seemed to play fine the first episode but the second episode seemed to have some parts missing, not like it paused and froze like an average scratched/smeared disk but it skipped over a full scene. (Looked up the episode online and found the missing part to clarify there was indeed a missing scene) From there the disk played fine, well, at least till episode 5 where it did the same thing, although this time around is skipped about a good 5-7 minutes. We only watched that one disk so we do not know what the other disks conditions are like but we still ordered a replacement which hopefully will not have this issue. Considering this package was ordered new and the disk/s (we checked the other disks as well) had no visible smears or scratches I have to assume the disk was printed incorrectly when it was manufactured. As I saw a small amount of reviews saying this kind of thing happened to them and many reviews saying how great this dvd set is  i'm hoping its only a few DVD packages are like this.

7581424,5,B019RR2IXS,"Who doesn't love Avatars?  She's got nothing on Ang and his posse, but the writing is strong and entertaining.  This one feels like it's written for a marginally older crowd and, to me, feels like it's missing some of the inherent joy of the original.  Having said that, all the boys can agree on this one when we want to watch something together.  Hope that the writers don't let the avatars go.

7581426,5,B019RR2IXS,"As someone that came late to the show (pretty late indeed, considering its been over a couple years), this set is a great deal. All episodes, compact package.

The extras are kind of minimal as far as I can tell, but to be fair I haven't looked on all the discs yet so there may be more that I'm missing. There's episode breakdowns by directors/producers, storyboarding etc. It does come with a compact art book, containing several pages of illustration per season and insights on design by the shows producers. Nice little extra.

The most important part is the show itself, though. Avatar: TLA was a great series. For me, the Legend of Korra absolutely matches up (and sometimes surpasses) it in every way.

The visuals are top notch; traditional hand drawn animation makes all the difference here. Too often these days animated shows will go for a more minimalist animation style or even worse, CGI. There are some CGI elements here, but very few (or some are blended so well I didn't notice). They certainly don't stand out in a negative way.

To sum it up, if you've never seen the show and are interested you should buy this set. I'd be very surprised if you didn't fall in love with the show for all these reasons:

1. Characters you care about
2. Great villians (even ones you might sympathize with)
3. Awesome action scenes
4. Genuinely hilarious (more often than you'd expect)
5. Voice talent off the charts (JK Simmons steals all the scenes he's in)
6. Hits all the emotional notes and then some.

Buy it.",1483401600,9,1516,4.617100371747212

There's about 10 pages per season in the booklet. There is also no episode guide included as well. So overall if you didn't have the previous individual seasons this is perfect, all you are missing out is on the artwork and episode guide that each of the individual releases include. One thing to add that I do appreciate is that if you collected the original Avatar: The Last Airbender individual season boxsets then this collection fits since the cover art has Korra in the Avatar state. There was an article that mentioned this set does have extra special features but as far as I know there are none, it was never promoted on the box set or on any of the other online retailers.

Aside from all that, it would have been great to have an episode guide for the box set and maybe even interior artwork to flip that way when you take out the slip cover there could be a difference.",1481673600,105,1672,6.527027027027027

7581437,5,B019RR2IXS,"Korra begins with a violent ""I'm the Avatar, deal with it"", when I first saw this show I was a little bit disappointed because I was very much in love with Aang's story and the characters of ATLA. When Korra begins most of those characters are dead, the world that we saw changed into a 1920's steampunk Big Apple city, it was a pretty violent change for a lot of fans that were put off with the brash, overpowered, naive, stubborn and sometimes self centered Korra who is eager to show the world that SHE IS the new Avatar. Underneath all her bravado a deep insecurity lies as her need to be worthy as Aang's successor.

The story is very good, the villians are interesting, the side characters are great, make no mistake on the whole LOK franchise there is only one main character and that is Korra, all the other characters are secondary, you won't see a tight friendship as in ATLA because this characters are 17-18 y/o and it has more realistic approach and interactions. Still Mako, Bolin, Asami and Tenzin are awesome.

We are introduced to many conflicts, beginning with the relationship between Benders vs Non-benders, how the second group feels oppressed, and how Korra learns what it means to be the Avatar of the whole world. After being sheltered her whole life we see her struggling, making friends, falling in love, failing and fighting against an enemy from the past.

If you have never seen this show I really recommend it, as it grows better with each season/book. It's not perfect (ATLA wasn't either) but it's a very good show and a cartoon for all ages!",1478390400,27,1574,4.614285714285714

7581439,4,B019RR2IXS,"I was a late come to The Last Airbender, but I instantly fell in love with the universe it introduced me to. When I heard a sequel series was approaching, I was excited as any. Personally, I am not disappointed.

Like anything else,  this series had its strengths and weaknesses.  Starting with the weakness, it must be stated plainly that Korra's crew lacks the charm of the Gaang. I did find myself missing the old cast, but kudos on the creative team for not making new versions of old characters.  These are at least originals.

The greatest strength of this show are its villains!  While Firelord Ozai was an incomprehensible and cliche villain bent on personal power, the villains of Korra rise well above that.  Here are villains that are frightening, not because of their power,  but because they are, or very nearly are, RIGHT! It is their methods and misguided tactics that must be stopped.  From Amon's search for equality for nonbenders, to Zaheers quest for freedom from oppressive government.  Here are villains you almost want to root for!

All in all, Korra is a fun show.",1477612800,17,1088,4.73404255319149
