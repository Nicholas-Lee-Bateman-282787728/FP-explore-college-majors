899780,5,6304558139,"To the point : Jerry Herman's Broadway at the Hollywood Bowl is a top showcase of his songs and lyrics. As Carol Channing said ' Double the pleasure, listen to the words '.Apart from Lorna Luft, Michael Feinstein and a lost of great singers, just to hear Bea Arthur sing is worth buying this DVD.",1010534400,13,296,4.4
899781,5,6304558139,"I saw this on PBS several years ago and I taped it. Unfortunately they had audio trouble on one orchestral medley. I saw it here and ordered it immediately. It's wonderful. Carol Channing gives a hilarious introduction. There is an international Dolly who sing Hello Dolly! the way it would be done in other countries and a ""Hello, Deli"" and Hello,Lyndon"" and of course the original Dolly, Carol Channing. Davis Gaines sings Song on the Sand beautifully. This is a gorgeous song and gorgeously done. Ditto to Leslie Uggams' rendition of If He Walked Into My Life. Marvelous! These are my two favorites and I listen to them/watch them over and over again. Lee Roy Reams does marvelous imitations of Louis Armstrong, Carol, and Pearl Bailey and Marlene Dietrich and Mae West on La Cage Aux Folles. Love It Only Takes a Moment and many of the others. Only wish that the whole song would have been sung. I have seen the sheet music and some is left out in the movie and play and I have sung it in its entirety. Lovely sentiment in that song and beautiful melody. Jerry Herman is truly a talent as Carol proclaims,""When God was passing out talent, Jerry got in line twice."" He wrote the words and music to all the songs. Buy this! You won't be sorry. I am considering buying it for a gift. I would love to have a copy of just the audio too, but can't figure out if there is one available. Regardless, if you love great Broadway music and Jerry Herman musicals, you will love this!",971222400,21,1475,4.4869888475836435
899782,5,6304558139,"Originally viewed on A&E years ago, I had the good fortune to video tape this rousing salute to one of Broadways Best!  That tape is worn out from playing over and over and over!  All star cast (Carol Channing, Bea  Arthur, Rita Moreno, George Hern, Leslie Uggams, Lorna Luft, Karen Morrow -  the list goes on & on).  Rita Moreno does a show stopping number  ""Tap, Tap Your Troubles Away"" - This is a composite of Broadway  at its best, celebrating the funny, inspirational and tearful compositions  of the genius that is Jerry Herman!",942883200,11,535,4.617021276595745
899987,5,6304558139,"I have  been a longtime fan of Jerry Herman's music so ""Jerry Herman's Broadway at the Hollywood Bowl"" (1993) was a great treat for me to watch on DVD. Don Pippin, Jerry's long-time musical director, was the conductor for the Los Angeles Philharmonic before a huge crowd in the Bowl. A platoon of major stars celebrated some of Jerry's great hits. One leaves a Herman show gleefully humming the lyrics; one often leaves a Sondheim show cerebrally grumbling through the lyrics. Jerry is the great tunemaster, and many of his songs will live for a great many years. Jerry will be 80 on July 10th of 2011. He wrote the lyrics and music for all of his shows.
 Many of the stars who appeared have been associated with Jerry's shows over the years. Carol Channing was very funny in her introductory remarks. Leslie Uggams was particularly good in this show. One of my all-time favorite songs is ""Time Heals Everything"" from Mack and Mabel. Lorna Luft (Judy's daughter) gives a superb rendition of the song. Also from Mack and Mabel George Hearn sang ""When Movie Were Movies."" Toward the end of the show he sings ""I Am What I am"" from La Cage au Folles and brings down the bowl.
 Bea Arthur who played Vera in Mame claimed that the show should have been named Vera after her character, but said that Jerry couldn't use that as a title because it was too hard to rhyme. Bea said, ""Sondheim could have made it work."" And everybody roared, even Jerry. Bea sang ""The Man in the Moon"" from ""Mame."" Lee Roy Reams did great impressions of Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Ethel Merman and Louis Armstrong singing ""Hello Dolly."" David Gaines did a fine job with ""Song on the Sand"" from ""La Cage aux Folles."" Lee Roy Reams really sold two of the songs from ""Hello Dolly.""
 The ""Hello Dolly"" tribute featured Carol Channing in full costume and even a marching band. ""Bosom Buddies"" from ""Mame"" featured Leslie Uggams and Rita Moreno. Michael Feinstein played piano and sang ""I Won't Send Roses"" from ""Mack and Mabel.""
 ""Take It All Off"" was a hilarious rendering from ""Les Girls."" Leslie Uggams was tremendous doing ""If He Walked into My Life.""
 The production values were excellent, and the show is very entertaining. There are good reaction shots of Jerry seated in the audience.
In the finale Jerry joins the entire cast, plays the piano and proves he is a great showman with ""The Best of Times"" from ""La Cage aux Folles."" The show ended with a fireworks display.
 Tuneful melodies, hummable and memorable lyrics, songs that keep repeating in your mind, shows with a lot of the joy of life: Jerry Herman has left a great legacy to the world.",1295308800,,2624,4.63010752688172
899988,5,6304558139,"I watched this DVD twice and found it more enjoyable the 2nd time round. One grouch I do have that is the use of hand mikes I would have thought with all the technical know how  body mikes would have been used. The hand mikes spoilt the emotional expressions on the singers faces  it was almost as if they were about to have oral. Bea Auther, Carol Channing used I presume body mikes and it was great seeing their expressions
The DVD in my opinion is excellent apart from my grouch you got more out of the disc than if you had actually been there the cast looked lost on the huge stage in the long shots Jerry Hermans music was played to its best making this disc value for money I highly recommend this disc

899989,5,6304558139,"As the daylight fades over the Hollywood Bowl, the orchestra begins - conducted by none other than Don Pippin, Jerry Herman's frequent musical director.  The star-studded tribute under the open sky transports us into the delicious, passionate, tender, often witty, self-affirming world of Jerry Herman's scores for musicals like ""Mame,"" ""Hello, Dolly!"" ""La Cage aux Folles.""

How did I manage to miss this 1993 concert?  Singers include Carol Channing, Leslie Uggams, George Hearn, Bea Arthur, Rita Moreno, Lee Roy Reams, Karen Morrow, Florence Lacey, Lorna Luft and Davis Gaines.

Sound, lighting and overall production value of this DVD is superb.  I was absolutely transfixed by Michael Feinstein's heartfelt performance of 'I Won't Send Roses"" (from ""Mack and Mabel"").  My only little quibble is that I'd have adored to hear more songs from Jerry's lesser known scores instead of so many toe-tapping, popular tunes.  (When my young son heard ""It Only Takes A Moment,"" he ran in to inform me that was from WALLE! Of course, I had to tell him all about Jerry Herman!)  I will never forget the joy in the composer/lyricist's face as he joined the cast to sing the finale ""The Best of Times"" (from ""La Cage"").",1241740800,,1209,5.01
899990,3,6304558139,"I received this as a Christmas present, and after watching it, I honestly wish I hadn't asked for it. It makes the ""My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies"" special look like perfection.

Their were many major mistakes overall in this special. Number One, YOU DONT SAY LIZA MINNELLI IS STARING IN THE SPECIAL IF SHE ISN'T EVEN PERFORMING! I'm sure their are numerous people who purchased this DVD and was expecting Liza to sing. And I'm sure they were all disappointed, and quiet surprised is that all she did was make a little introduction; Mistake Number Two: THE PERFORMERS PERFORMED TOO MANY TIMES! I mean seriously, I'm sure they're plenty of Broadway singers who love Jerry Herman's music. It was really stupid that they had singers like Lorna Luft perform like four or five times. Lorna is a splendid singer, But having her sing that many times is a mistake. Another such example would be Leslie Uggams. So basically what I am trying to say, is that each performer performed too many times. And they should have gotten more entertainers to participate in the special.

Lastly, Mistake Number Three. THEY KEPT SINGING THE SONGS FROM THE SAME THREE OR FOUR MUSICALS! Jerry Herman wrote several musicals, and making it so that their should have been an even amount of songs sung from each one of his musicals. It shouldn't have been based all on the entertainer's favorites.",1230336000,7,1379,4.814345991561181
899991,5,6304558139,"What a glorious music video.  Davis Gaines singing ""Song in the Sand"" is worth the price of the video.  George Herman singing ""I Am What I Am"" is also excellent.  It is very entertaining.  It has been a long time since I have been at the Hollywood Bowl and the atmosphere is also excellent.",1230249600,2,290,4.314814814814815
899992,4,6304558139,"Jerry Herman has become a legend by his own merits this special is filled with the best of his music, and with appearences of some of the stars that have acted in them. Is a lovely show but it doesn't have enough chorus to fullfilled the big Herman numbers. I wait for more stars but there were few. Good for Hermans an Broadway fans",1196640000,,333,4.21875
899993,5,6304558139,"What a unique and wonderful evening this was at the Hollywood Bowl! For those of us who were not lucky enough to be there in person, this DVD provides the perfect next-best-thing. What a marvelous chance to hear this music - some well-known and some not-so-well-known - sung by such a superb cast. The incomparable voice of Davis Gaines is a standout, caressing ""Song on the Sand"" with such tenderness and power, he turns it into both an anthem and a lullaby.",1183334400,2,459,4.609756097560975
899994,5,6304558139,"I bought this for myself but will have to order 3 more for friends of mine, they love it so much. I am so glad the concert is now available on DVD and hope other concerts will follow!",1156032000,4,183,3.8421052631578947
899995,5,6304558139,"This has to be the best concert I have ever seen.  Two hours of great performers (too bad Angela Lansbury could not be there) singing the music of Jerry Herman (Mame, La Cage, Hello Dolly, Dear World, The Grand Tour, Milk and Honey, Mack and Mabel, and for tv Mrs. Santa Clause).  We get a full plate of great stars including Bea Arthur, Carol Channing, Michael Feinstein, and many more.

The sound on this program is superb, great stereo separation. The filming was first rate. The performances are timeless.  The nicest part is that Don Pippin, Jerry Herman's right-hand man for orchestration and conducting, is here, and leads the full orchestra with the type of orchestrations that make Jerry's music shine, and exactly the kind of orchestrations he likes for his music, so no 2nd rate arrangements. There are also 3 orchestral medleys that are terrific.  My favorite on the disc is Michael Feinsteins superb rendition of ""I Wont Send Roses."" No other person could sing this so so beautifully. Other highlights include Channing doing Hello Dolly to 3 standing ovations, Bea Arthur doing a her song from Mame, ""The Man in the Moon,"" and from Mack and Mabel, a great tap dance to ""Tap Your Troubles Away.""  Sadly, nothing was used from The Grand Tour, while not a hit, was a great score, and I was sad to see ""Tomorrow Morning"" or ""One Person"" from Dear World was not included. I also wish there had been a few big production numbers like the ""Mame"" theme song, but it is done here in a great orchestral version. These complaints are very minor, I have watched this concert more than 15 times and plan to see it many more.

If you like Broadway music and the scores of Jerry Herman, this is a must. If you've been under a table and not sure about this music, Jerry is one of the best broadway showtune composers ever, and I highly suggest you give this program a viewing (or 2).",1147824000,34,1880,4.560830860534125
899996,5,6304558139,"It only takes a moment to fall in love everlastingly with the immortal music of Jerry Herman.  This DVD is a sublime treatment of some of the best of the best.  It is impossible to listen to this music and not love it.

The cliche is true:  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll experience the full range of human emotions.  The entire show is one big highlight, but for me, some transcendant standouts include Michael Feinstein's perfect rendition of the classic ""I Won't Send Roses"" from Mack and Mabel, as well as ""Song in the Sand"" from La Cage aux Folles.  And watching Jerry Herman himself being moved to tears by Leslie Uggams' great ""If He Walked Into My Life"" shows how much that song means to its creator, and to millions of others.

Jerry Herman is irrefutable evidence that human beings can create works that the angels in Heaven would envy.  Buy this DVD!  You will never regret it.",1113868800,11,890,4.547169811320755

7874334,5,6304558139,This is an outstanding musical presentation. There are a variety of excellent performers. The orchestra was great. There was a variety of comical and serious numbers. Leslie Uggams rendition of  'If He Walked Into My Life' brought tears to my eyes. Lorna Luft's song 'Take It All Off' was hilarious. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes really great music.,1339286400,,366,4.903225806451613
7874335,1,6304558139,"first disappointment: it's probably 20 years old. 2nd: the only jerry herman's girl's that perform are carol channing & bea arthur (& george hearn) the rest are singers that aren't up to snuff. the 3rd: it's sooo long with too many instrumentals. do yourself a favor, rent the sondheim birthday concert video instead. it's a 5 star video!",1324944000,,338,4.844827586206897
7874336,5,6304558139,"I first saw this concert performance of the music of Jerry Herman back in the 90's, perhaps on the Bravo network; I made a taped copy of it at that time, and that tape had to suffice until someone had the good sense to bring the whole grand affair to DVD.  What a glorious evening of entertainment it was!  What a glorious evening of entertainment it remains!  It captures the likes of Carol Channing in a manner we might never see her again.  It brings Lorna Luft to the stage for two numbers from Jerry's ""masterpiece,"" the wonderful ""Mack and Mabel.""  Where has this girl been?  Shouldn't she have had a career like Liza's?  I mean...the extraordinary talent is there!  Yes, it would have been great if Angela Lansbury could have been there in person to recreate a number from ""Mame,"" but the almost two hours of entertainment are filled with enough talent to fill the void Lansbury might have left.  Jerry Herman has created, in show after show, memorable tunes that, in time, have become important additions to our music heritage, tunes that one finds oneself humming on leaving a show or after listening to a Broadway recording...and isn't that what it's all about...to leave us singing, to lift our spirits, to make us feel good about this thing called life, this human experience we all share and which Jerry focuses on so splendidly through his genius?  As I write this I just recently downloaded ""Tap Your Troubles Away,"" the CD recording of another evening in salute to Jerry.  You might enjoy this as a CD recording of ""Jerry Herman's Broadway at the Hollywood Bowl"" has never been produced.  Again...it's this glorious compilation of the music that makes the spirits of this listener sing!",1308614400,,1702,4.7322033898305085
