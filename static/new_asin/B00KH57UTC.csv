6426421,5,B00KH57UTC,Ours kids (5 and 7) really like this movie. It isn't scary at all and the English dubbing doesn't bother them at all - they couldn't even tell. Netflix used to have it in English and it suddenly turned to German?? so we are now looking for a cheap English version.,1440633600,2,264,4.196078431372549

8658610,1,B00KH57UTC,"Cannot give even 1 star, as I did not receive the product that I ordered.  Product info says it's in German.  It is not.  I do not recommend risking ordering this product if you want the German soundtrack.  IF you want English only, enjoy it.  It's a cute movie.",1475712000,,262,4.26530612244898
8658611,1,B00KH57UTC,"The story is absolutely cute! I loved the book when I was little and read it in German. but I'm really disappointed because I bought this movie expecting a movie in German language. When we got it we realized it was in English and there was no option to switch the language either.
I hope Amazon can modify the product description",1456531200,2,330,4.426229508196721
