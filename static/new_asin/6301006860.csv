7810428,5,6301006860,"The movie's cover states that this movie is a psycholochical drama... This is a story that has a strong mythological theme -- a mythological theme found in the King Arthur myths.  The love between Guinevere and King Arthur is a familial love, which is contrasted against the passionate love between Guinevere and Sir Lancelot.  The myth is telling of a truth in human nature; we have familial love within the marriage after passion has abated, but we cannot have both at the same time.
  Julia is an American Guinevere who lives in Italy and marries an Italian ship builder(Paolo).  He supposedly dies in a car before the marriage can be consumated.  But Julia experiences a parallel universe in which they live happily and have a son.  Julia has a passionate affair with a photographer.  She tries to end the affair, because she has existed six years without her beloved husband and is suddenly thrown into the novelty of a family life.  Her passion for her husband still exists.  Therefore, she doesn't need the affair to feel passion again.
  Upon the conclusion of the movie, the audience learns that she cannot have both passionate love and familial love.  Like Guinevere, she becomes a cloistered woman who will continue to exist without either.
  It is a brilliant and intelligently written film with surreal ambiance -- one which I highly recommend to those who view movies as literature on film.",1025049600,5,1404,4.864978902953586
7810429,5,6301006860,"This movie is truly the saddest story I have ever encountered in a movie! Julia (Kathleen Turner) is widowed on the day of her wedding to Paolo (Gabriel Byrne) and doesn't ever seem to recover. Several years later, in supernatural circumstances she finds herself flitting between two versions of her life. In one she is married to Paolo with a child, and having an affair with a mysterious photographer (Sting), in the other life she is the widow of many years who meets this same man(Sting again). She is emotionally torn and utterly confused, and events lead to the inevitable heart rending conclusion! This is a must see!",990489600,5,624,4.787037037037037
7810430,5,6301006860,"This is a great film.
If you take it scene by scene, the plot is mathematically correct down to the last, irritating detail. What is fantasy and what is reality is really important. The trick, however, is to know when it's one and when it's the other. To hell with The Cell.
The title makes perfect sence, since she is schizophrenic and has two personalities.
All good art is ambiguous. Here you are supposed to think she is cheating on her husband, which she of course only is doing in her own mind to a fatal end.",974073600,2,515,4.319587628865979
7810431,4,6301006860,"If you're prepared to put logic aside, you can have a lot of fun with this film shot on high definition videotape for Italian TV and released theatrically. The title is misleading since Kathleen Turner as Julia only has one personality. It's her sense of reality that is multiplied. Grieving after the loss of her husband, she drives through a white cloud of smoke 6 years later, to enter the world where he had not died. Kathleen scores laughs as she tries to adapt to the expectations of those in her new (to her) world. It's similar to her later role in Peggy Sue Got Married, and there is the suggestion that the Julia that she has become has done things that Kathleen's Julia is unaware of since her husband, Gabriel Byrne, is projecting subtext. However Kathleen's bliss is short-lived when she is returned to the first reality where she starts a portentious affair with Sting. (We know from Brimstone & Treacle, and Plenty that anyone who dallies with him is in for trouble). Kathleen Turner is one of those actresses like Ingrid Bergman who can make the silliest predicament watcheable by their intense over-acting, even in spite of director Peter Del Monte being somewhat less than gallant in her sex scenes. He gives us a Hitchcock-ian set piece where Kathleen is being pursued and is rescued from the exiting crowd of a theatre, which is one of only two scenes where extras are used. The other is where she is being harassed by Sting in a piazza and the extras look non-plussed. Otherwise Julia's worlds are unusually underpopulated. Whether finally either reality is real or imaginary becomes unimportant since Del Monte is more interested in being metaphysically stylish. He cuts into Turner's sobbing in the car just before the cloud appears, as if he wasn't happy with any of her takes and had to splice them together, but also provides the film with a lovely Maurice Jarre score.",970272000,4,1895,4.762917933130699
