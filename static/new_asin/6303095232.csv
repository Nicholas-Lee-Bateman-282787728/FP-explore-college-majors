558100,4,6303095232,"Shirley plays a young girl named Lloyd Sherman in this movie.
Lloyd's mother and grandfather haven't spoken to each other since a fight involving Lloyd's southern mother and her yankee husband (it was in the 1870's and lloyd's grandfather was a confederate soldier.)  So when Lloyd's mother and father move into a cottage very close to her grandfather's house, it's up to Lloyd to bring them back together in a time of crisis.
Also starring Lionel Barrymore as Lloyd's grandfather.",1056326400,3,481,5.0125

558102,5,6303095232,"I don't quite understand why they say that this is more of an adult movie. I think this is one of Temple's bests,and boy I've seen em all. When the Door Shuts It Will Never Again Be Opened for  Elizabeth and Jack. Clueless? Elizabeth's dad the colonel played by Lionel Barrymore  flips out when his beautiful daughter  runs away and marries a northener. (let me remind you this is post civil war) Then they have a beautiful child who's name is Lloyd Sherman (temple) well while the father stays out west to get money the mother and daughter move into a cottage right next to the colonel's house ! Temple is at her peak or maybe it was just me imagaining,but anyone who sees this movie is bedazzled. It is quite a joy to see her and Barrymore fighting because of him poking her and then watching the mud throw ! She's very cute and very ummm what's the word...outspoken? Well whatever that word is you'll see. ... In one point of the movie shirley asks her grandmotherd  name and Lionel says Aminthus ,if you are a shirley fan you will know that she had told him the name because he had asked for line. She thought she was helping out but he thought she was making fujn of him. When he flipped out on her she was angry. When he thretened to leave the set They made her apologize even though all she did was try to help. This movie is great,especially watch the staircase dance. Shirley didn't understand racism quite yet but  Bill Robinson (bojangles) was her favorite  person to work with,the chemistry between the 2 is just fabolous!@",997315200,7,1535,4.444839857651245

Even at her tender young age no one needed to tell her what was right and what was wrong.
Adored so much that kings and queens and other nobility would visit the Us, and as soon as they spoke with the protocol folks, they would invariably ask to meet The Little Colonel, oops, sorry Little Miss Sunshine, sorry The Little Pricess.
this is among my favorites of all generas. I not only recommend it highly, I recommend watching it with someone you love and who is much younger like grand nice or granddaughter.

Mr. Robinson is the most amazing tap dancer. It is the not only the way he executes the moves with his feet, but the way he uses his hands. There are the ""dated"" parts that portray African-Americans in a negative way, but those can be fast forwarded through. Lionel Barrymore is wonderful as the grandfather and the visual surprise at the end is a great touch. The streaming print is very high quality.",1432512000,,549,4.670103092783505

The movie brings back fond childhood memories, and I loved watching it again, it lifted up my spirits. Shirley Temple is absolutely adorable in her role of Colonel Lloyd Sherman, and interacts wonderfully with the actors around her.

558283,4,6303095232,"Shirley Temple is undoubtedly the star of this movie. Lionel Barrymore is in it, too and he is no actor to sneeze at, but, this is a Shirley Temple showcase, and a great showcase for her talents. That is not saying it is a particularly good movie, per se. In the pantheon of great movies, The Little Colonel does not come close to great. It is extreme melodrama, and not very good melodrama, at that. It is merely a showcase of Shirley Temple's talent. She is a better actor than most of the other actors that support her, especially the male and female ingenue leads. If I said they were wooden, it would be a compliment. Shirley Temple can act. She acts and reacts, and is completely involved in the story which helps us stay involved. She keeps up with much more experienced Lionel Barrymore who is always fun to watch. He is a legendary actor from a legendary acting family so I kept wondering if he was not as fully invested in his role, but it doesn't matter, he is too good to be bad. In any event, this is Shirley Temple's movie and she is cuter than any child star ever ( my opinion, but there are a lot of people who would agree) and this movie shows that cuteness in abundance. But mostly I loved this movie for her two dances with Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson. The stair dance in particular. What fun!
If you wonder why Shirley Temple is an historic and iconic figure in film, The Little Colonel is a prime example. Watch this movie and you can see why she could influence a whole generation and was an inspiration for our country that was in the depths of the depression. President Roosevelt himself noted her positive influence on the moral of our country. I can guarantee one thing, she will make you smile! and that is a great recommendation for any movie.",1392681600,,1769,4.412844036697248

558316,5,6303095232,This is my favorite Shirley Temple movie.. Because of his stuburness (spelling) grandfather didn't find out about Shirley till she was 6 yrs old...And that was by accident..

558358,3,6303095232,"There are several things to like about this movie.  There's the multi-talented little Shirley Temple who easily dominates almost every scene she's in and the picture in total.  And there's the remarkable dancing of Bill Robinson.  The two dance scenes he has with Shirley Temple save the picture.

The film attempts to perpetuate the idyllic myth.  I can't recall a movie about the differences between North and South wherein the sympathy is not all for the South and, by inference, ante bellum slavery.  This film is set in Kentucky, a border state that produced more Union soldiers than Confederates, but you never get a hint of that in the stupid ramblings of the Lionel Barrymore character.  Then there is the way that black people were portrayed, subservient and happy to be so, taking no offense at the gross insults from whites.  At one point Barrymore threatens physical harm at Bill Robinson's character for almost breaking a knicknack, and in another scene calls black children ""pickaninnies.""  Hattie McDaniel plays another Mammy, complete with bandana tied around her head and with supposedly amusing glitches in syntax.

I realize that this was made long ago, under a different ethos.  Few moviegoers would have protested.  But that doesn't change the morality of it.

The setting more resembles Tara than any place I ever saw of Kentucky.  There's the grand mansion, filled with huge paintings of ancestors, fine china whatnots, a library, etc.  Then there's the cottage in which Shirley and her mother live.  They just moved in that morning, but it is clean and tidy and very nicely furnished after a vacancy of years.

Unfortunately innocent viewers will be misled by all this.  This wasn't the real Kentucky or the way blacks felt about Ole Massa.  Movies always take poetic license with history, but this movie goes too far.  Only the performances of Temple and Robinson save this from the trash heap.  I realize that Southern romantics and apologists will disagree.  Let 'em.",1243641600,,1994,4.996960486322188
558359,3,6303095232,"It's odd that Shirley Temple made two Civil War-era movies in the same year, with her charactesr being very similar. ""The Littlest Rebel"" took place during the Civil War and ""The Little Colonel"" took place right after the war.

It's usually touching to see Shirley melting a crabby old man's heart as she did in some of her films, this being one of them. Here, it's Lionel Barrymore she converts into a good soul.

The lead female role was played by Evelyn Venable and she really wasn't up to the standards set by previous Temple adult feminine leads such s Gloria Stuart, Karen Moreley, Rochelle Hudson, etc.. but that's not important.

Temple, meanwhile, is so cute that she's even likable when she's a brat, as she acts several times with the old man (but apologizes later for her behavior).  All in all, the lesser of the two ""war movies,"" but still a decent film",1236902400,2,867,4.6103896103896105

558362,4,6303095232,"THE LITTLE COLONEL was the first of two movies, released in 1935, that featured Shirley Temple in a Civil War storyline.

Based on a story by Annie Fellows Johnston, Shirley Temple plays the strong-willed Miss Lloyd Sherman, trying to reconcile her mother (Evelyn Venable) with her embittered grandfather (Lionel Barrymore).  Temple is especially appealing in this film, where she gets to wear some beautiful hoopskirt costumes.

It's also in this film where Temple performs the legendary ""Staircase Dance"" with Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson, who would go on to appear in several more films with Temple based solely on his success here.  This is one of the rare films where Shirley Temple doesn't sing; the only musical moment is provided with ""Love's Young Dream"", sung by a dubbed Evelyn Venable.

One of the all-time Temple greats, THE LITTLE COLONEL also features good work from Hattie McDaniel, John Lodge and Sidney Blackmer.  The DVD inclues both B&W and computer-coloured versions of the film.",1178841600,8,997,5.2
558363,5,6303095232,"This is a classic Temple film! The Tap Dance on the stairs sequence is now legendary and it is amazing to see this talented kid keep up with Bill"" Bo Jangles"" Robinson. One of my favorits Shirley Temple movies for sure! There are only a hand full of her films that I will always remember and this is one of them. Heidi, Bright Eyes and Curly Top were the others. The DVD has both Black and White and Colorized version. I am not a fan of colorizing anything but, since they included the original B&W version, I am happy with this release. I did enjoy watching both versions.",1174867200,3,573,4.314814814814815
558364,4,6303095232,"1935's ""The Little Colonel"" is one of four feature films Shirley Temple made for Fox Studios and is also one of my favorites of her films !  Set in the Civil War,Temple plays a young girl to her already gruff,but lovable grandfather colonel (played well by Lionel Barrymore) as they try to patch up their troubled family,but things get in the way with Temple's father in a bad loan deal with his so-called 'friends'.This is the film that features the classic and much-imitated dancing on the stairs routine with Temple and co-star Bill Robinson,the first of four films they would do together.""Gone With The Wind"" it isn't,but with a stellar cast,good solid direction by David Butler,and the classic dance sequence,this is a very good and well-made film with careful pace,hilarious scenes,and serious moments that will appeal to any member of the family old or new !  Recommended !

ABOUT THE DVD:

This is the very first time that Fox has released this very good film on DVD as part of the Volume 3 Collection of Temple's films which contains both a restored black & white version of the film (with the original Technicolor ending) and a brand-new digitally remastered colorized version as well. The restored black & white print used here on this disc is superb,if not very very good with a few instances of film grain and scratches. Speaking of the Technicolor ending,previous video releases of this film inexplicably edit out the ending of the film,notably in the original 1994 colorized VHS version,but here its been beautifully restored and shows signs of grain and very seldom contrast. As for the new colorized version,it completely blows away the horrendously bad original colorized version from a few decades before as Legend Films always does an excellent job restoring and remastering their colorized films to DVD,it too retains the original Technicolor ending from the original release,but the Legend colorized version is more saturated and well-balanced and carefully recolorized as the original version. The extras (hence the four star rating) include the two same unrestored trailers for both ""Heidi"" and ""Little Miss Broadway"" that also appear on other recent Fox Temple DVD's,but it also has a rare Fox Movietone Newsreel excerpt that celebrates the star's 7th birthday and runs one whole minute. Purists will definitely stick to the original b&w,but this film's colorized appeal will bring back a dejavu dream to ""Gone With The Wind"" in terms of the Civil War backdrop and oh,of course that too co-starred Hattie MacDaniel who plays the maid in ""Colonel"".Well recommended by film buffs and classic family film fans alike !",1151020800,5,2639,5.073732718894009
