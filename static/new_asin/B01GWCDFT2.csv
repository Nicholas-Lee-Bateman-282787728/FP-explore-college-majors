7769409,4,B01GWCDFT2,Great series and still timely at its ' age with an an award winning sound track.  B&W but a good watch over many hours for the price.,1356480000,7,133,3.925925925925926
7769410,4,B01GWCDFT2,Classic documentary filmmaking from the immediate post-WW2 era and incredible and incredibly useful (for research) footage of the war in stunning first-person detail.  A must own for any WW2 buff or historian.,1356220800,5,209,5.53125
7769411,5,B01GWCDFT2,"I remember watching this series when it was a broadcast program on NBC in the 1960's.

The series is a compendium of actual war footage of Pacific operations during WWII.  The series documents, step-by-step, the comeback of the Pacific fleet and its campaign to Tokyo.  It includes raw footage of U. S. Marine beach heads, and, U. S. Army involvement in the Pacific.  Much of the footage in this documentary was not released to the public during the War.

Most of the film is composed of footage of actual battles, the commanders of the operations, and the men who fought so valiantly to bring peace to the Pacific Basin.

The film is scored with the Emmy award winning music of Richard Rogers and Robert Russell Bennet.  The score is one of the high points of the DVD series.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Victory-at-Sea/dp/B0000064X9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Victory at Sea</a>.  The music has become one of the benchmarks of American classical music.

Unlike many of the historical films produced about the war in the Pacific, this series underscores the hardships sailors encountered in the drive to Tokyo.  The footage does not spare us from the grim realities of the War, but, accurately portrays its horrors and the incredible courage of the sailors who faced long odds.

It is difficult to find a more detailed and accurate account of the war in the Pacific than this series.",1354060800,135,1430,5.200873362445415

7769426,5,B01GWCDFT2,"I grew up watching this series on television. It is among the best of the short versions about WWII. Of course, the title tells that it does not cover the ground war in Europe as much as the landings, etc. But is still covers its subject concisely. I keep hunting for my father in some of the pictures of soldiers in the landings at Oran, at the 2nd Battle of El Alamein, in Sicily, and in Naples.

7769456,5,B01GWCDFT2,"This series develops the history of World War II with great accuracy and humanity.  For those indoctrinated in the post-Vietnam era revisionist history, this will set you straight.  The nobility of the Allies and the evil of Germany and Japan are clearly staked out.  How America, in particular, overcame a lack of preparedness and the horrific surprise attack on Pearl Harbor is spelled out.  It is why American Presidents and the US intelligence agencies have sought to head off any further such events.  Things were pretty dicey back in 1941.  Americans should watch this series and consider what the consequences are of a politicized intelligence community, how dangerous splattering emails all over the open web is, and how the world was and is made up of nations that would in fact destroy us if given a chance.",1508198400,,817,4.927007299270073

7769486,5,B01GWCDFT2,"My Dad, having served in the US Navy, during World War II, this music and the videos were pretty much required listening/viewing in our house. I've always thought the video episodes were some of the best World War II footage ever recorded, and the music was always exhilarating. And Leonard Graves' narration reverberates through the whole thing. The only quibble I have with this set, which contains all 26 episodes, and all the music, from all three original LPs, is that it doesn't stop after each episode, just plays right through all 26 episodes. I'm old, now, and often fall asleep while the disc is playing; I wake up several episodes 'down the line' from where I last remember watching. The 26 episodes are on two DVDs, a third DVD is devoted to other American wars: The Revolutionary War, The Civil War, WW I, WW II, Korea, and Viet Nam, very informative, lots of information I never knew.

7769503,2,B01GWCDFT2,"This is the grand daddy of all TV war documentaries.  All genuine period films from allied and axis sources, beautifully edited, strikingly narrated with fantastic NBC orchestra music.  What's not to like.  Every WWII vet I knew loved watching this show.  It will not disappoint those interested in the Second World War, as depicted from only a few years later, during Korea at the start of the Cold War.  It is an essential have for any WWII video collection.  The series gets five stars.

But this is a terrible copy -- slightly blurry and dim.  We have the VHS version of VaS from the 1990s, and the low-res VHS version has a decidedly better, brighter and clearer picture than this purportedly DVD version.

While the price is right, versions of at least equal picture quality of this nearly 65-year-old show are often freely available on the Internet.  Buy this version only for the convenience of easy DVD viewing.",1493078400,2,920,4.765822784810126
7769504,5,B01GWCDFT2,"Excellent history of the US Navy in the Second World War. It covers the war in the Atlantic as well as the Pacific. The efforts to keep Great Britain and the USSR supplied with tanks, trucks, airplanes, jeeps, other war materiel as well as food, clothing and medicine is discussed. Naval battles, such as Midway and Coral Sea are described. It's somewhat one sided, not surprisingly, but problems the US Navy faced with it's own torpedoes and depth charges are not ignored.

7769579,5,B01GWCDFT2,"Since virtually all of the footage was from soon after WWII it is not revisionist, meaning that it has been changed. I am nearly 73 years old and watched this originally on TV when I was 8 years old and then it was original. It is arguably the best documentary of WWII ever done. There are other videos regarding WWII but none were done originally right after WWII and that is what makes this different. All the time that passes between an event and the reporting of it lends itself to revisionism. Not only are the Russians famous for this but it exists in the US too. Look at the current high school history books now and those from 50 years ago, they do not say the same thing. Yes, new information is discovered and requires correction in historical accounts, but to find out what really happened you have to read what was written at the time and compare it with what is reported now, frequently it is different. Also, if you lived through a period you know what happened and it does not frequently agree with what is being said currently. Germany during WWII is an example. It is frequently portrayed in novels and movies that ALL Germans supported the pogrom against the Jewish people. That is not true, most people in Germany did not even know about the concentration camps, the Nazi propaganda machine said that the Jews were working a ""good"" Germans in munitions factories and other industries not being gassed. Much of this information comes from my father who worked for the Nazi Regime as an accountant; he was not a Nazi, but did the work any accountant would do. Be careful of what you read and view, look at when it was done and who produced it. The older the source of information is the more likely it is to be accurate, but there is no guarantee, And yes, the United States does put out disinformation and revisionist propaganda, All countries do, except there is little revisionist information produced by neutral countries like Sweden or Canada.",1475971200,,1965,4.601139601139601

Especially informative for those who are younger than baby boomers and don't really know what happened in WWII.  Mostly comprised of actual film footage shot by allied photographers or captured from Germany, Italy, and Japan. Despite the name, the series actually covers the entire war in the Pacific, the Atlantic, Europe, and North Africa.  Epic!  Black and white.  Original musical score by Richard Rogers. Includes all 26 episodes originally aired on NBC in 1952.  The narration by Leonard Graves is over the top with drama and hubris, but after watching the series and realizing how close we came to losing all that we hold dear in 1941-1945, it will become understandable.

7769659,1,B01GWCDFT2,"""Victory at Sea"" is the classic documentary of World War II that was broadcast by NBC in the 1950s. At the time od its boadcast, this 26-episode series received rave reviews. I had owned the series on VHS tapes many years ago and enjoyed it tremendously.

When I saw this DVD edition from Mill Creek Entertainment of ""Victory at Sea,"" I decided to buy it. I figured it would be a major upgrade from my old VHS set, which I still have. When I received it, I was very disappointed.

The monochrome video is of extremely poor quality. It is grainy, dark. and full of anomalies. It's obvious to me that the producers of this DVD made little or no effort to compensate for aging film. Worse still, the audio portion is so overmodulated and loud that it  almost completely overwhelms the narration track, and sounds distorted through my home theater system's speakers..Both the video and audio quality made this particular Mill Creek Entertainment edition of ""Victory at Sea"" nearly unwatchable for me.

Hopefully, I'll soon be able to find an edition of this magnificent documentary that will be of sufficient technical quality that I'll be able to watch and enjoy it. This edition is a non-starter. Not recommended.",1457913600,20,1211,4.779904306220096

I remember the title of the documentary as it was screened many years ago and then it was a great doco.
IT could well be too today if not for the poor quality of the images.
I can stand that but I simply cannot stand the background music taking precedent over the foreground narration.
I watched part of the first chapter then clicked over to several others still to have the annoying music over ride the narration.
So I switched it off and it will probably stay off.
Out of all the war documentaries I have seen, and I have seen a lot this one must be the worst and simply cannot be recommended.

You can see the Wikipedia article on Victory at Sea for full details on its history, but bottom line it was made by ex Navy people and has a clear Navy spin that leaves out important contributions by other branches of the Military. Consequently it is a biased history that must be taken with a grain of salt. For example the bit on Guadalcanal, makes it appear that the Navy arrived, landed the marines, then a few months later they left after having won the day.... NO MENTION of the Army, huh?! A more accurate portrayal would have mentioned the fact that the Navy's marines came, did their bit, got very sick and tired from disease and fighting and were relieved by the ARMY, which moved in under General Alexander Patch... who fought another full 6-8 months before the battle of Guadalcanal was won.",1435881600,,974,4.603448275862069

The musical score, produced as an operetta, is memorable, in spite of being rarely heard nowadays.

7769808,5,B01GWCDFT2,"I was eight years old when this came out in 1952. My Dad had been an Army Captain in WWII. My neighbors were mid-20s combat infantrymen just returned. TV was in its infancy. The war was only just over, and after great cost we prevailed. This show, rightly, celebrated that victory.
Victory at Sea was, and is, a recounting of the sacrifice and valor of those who made victory in war possible. I was transfixed. As stupid as it sounds, it set the course of my life. I wanted to fly airplanes off aircraft carriers! Sixteen years later I had my 'Wings of Gold' and was doing just that.
The music is groundbreaking and I play it often. The narration by Peter Graves is, to me, stunning for early-50s television. Great voice, but greater script. Pro-American sure, but measured, respectful, lyrical (Shakespeare, really? ""If it be now, 'tis not to come....""), and honors the young Americans (and Brits, French, & Russians) who won that horrible struggle. Way ahead of its time. Still a 'must see' history classic. TV can be great.",1422489600,2,1026,4.6740331491712706

I always loved this series and its old school documentary approach with all actual footage and flat as a billiard table narration by Leonard Graves. Watching this always gave me a feeling of being there. There is something about sea and the naval warfare perspective that I like about this series. It just seem so dynamic and impressive in the way events are chronicled. And then there is the music composed by Richard Rodgers and orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett. This something worth having and passing down to other generations simply because it is history and it is about the men and women who made it and lived it. What happened and how it was documented on film is something of value. VICTORY AT SEA demonstrates just that.

Seriously, there are periods in which no words are spoken for over 10 straight minutes ... just photos and loud/overly dramatic music. At times I wanted to screamed ""ENOUGH ALREADY! TELL THE FREAKIN STORY!"" And the over preachy narrative, same deal ""ENOUGH ALREADY! TELL THE FREAKIN STORY!"" It's too bad because VAS covers many topics that are most are not familiar with, and some of the footage is amazing, but the good stuff gets lost in all the drama!

And I do understand the historical significance of the series, and that it means a lot to many, but it is just not a good documentary. If you want a great doc on WW2 see Ken Burns ""The War"" or even BBC ""World at War"" because this one will kill ya!",1416009600,2,837,4.506578947368421

7769899,4,B01GWCDFT2,"This series is a classic and a must for anyone that wants to understand World War Two and more specifically the naval portion of the war.  It includes all the major naval battles of the war by all the combatants with actual footage shot during the action.  As a series that originally aired on broadcast television, it isn't as brutal as I thought it might be (if you can say that about war reporting) with gratuitous violence that you often see in more modern movies.  Younger people, especially, need to see this to understand their history.  I grew up on this sort of WW2 material in the late 50's and early 60's so it was second nature to me.  But younger people never see this as it seems like history starts with the Vietnam war these days. The narration is obviously slanted to the U.S. viewpoint in the war, but that doesn't detract from the presentation. My only problem with this video is that they have taken the original TV footage and transferred it directly to DVD with no cleanup at all.  The WW2 film footage that was then transferred to television when this was originally produced is pretty crude compared to today'[s standard for video and sound.  And it shows.  I know it is possible to run old video and sound through computer algorithms that can improve the quality, and with this had been processed that way.  It would have undoubtedly raised the price, but this material deserves it.",1412812800,,1407,4.596

The 26 episodes track the separate but overlapping fighting in the Pacific, North Africa, and Europe. The focus is on the heroics of American sailors, airmen, soldiers and Marines.  The combat footage lends an air of authenticity that might be missed with a more modern production featuring digital recreations and graphics.  The commentary is fairly austere, built for an audience already familiar with the war and without doubts about its conduct.  More modern viewers without some prior knowledge of the war may have trouble with the context of each episode. Don't miss the footage of the Normandy invasion.

The rolling ocean shot at the beginning of each program with the forceful voice of Leonard Graves is unforgettable.  Although the ""World At War"" is the definitive WWII documentary series, ""Victory At Sea"" still holds up well.  And of course the music by Rogers and Bennett is exceptional.

7770009,5,B01GWCDFT2,"I have been reluctant to buy this series for a long time because of the many bad reviews that I have seen. One review complained about the video company's logo in the corner of the screen that you cannot make go away (no logo in this set). I recently discovered that the copyright on this series has expired. As a result, anybody can make their own dvd version of this series. When I saw how low the price was for this dvd set, I decided to go for it, even if the quality was off. Now that I've watched all the episodes, I consider it one of the best purchases that I've ever made. These are not restored episodes. They look just as scratchy as they did originally on TV. What can you expect, they were filmed under battle conditions. This series was originally supposed to narrated by the actor Robert Montgomery, but after he saw the film condition, he backed out of the project. He was replaced by Leonard Graves, an actor who was an understudy to Yul Brynner in the stage presentation of The King and I. The bonus disc is actually just a long commercial for other war series produced by this company. I found them to be boring and poorly done.  For example, in the Revolutionary War program they talked about slaves fighting in the Revolutionary War and they showed a picture of Frederick Douglass. In another part, they discussed the role of indians in the fighting and showed a clip of some 1930s vintage western movie in what looked like Monument Valley. The background music sometimes overpowered the narration. My advice is watch the bonus disc if you have nothing else to do. If you just want to throw away the bonus disc, the cost of the Victory at Sea series is still an incredible bargain. If you're young enough to have never known anything but high definition digital films, you probably will not like the series.

Since all I wanted it for was a remembrance of my youth, this was good enough.  As for the folks who think these shows are propaganda, keep in mind we're 60 years on and the zeitgeist has changed since these were planned, recorded, and spliced.

There are many powerful images, that help illustrate the strength and sacrifice that was required to defeat the forces of totalitarianism.

The series was produced and aired in black and white, so don't expect beautiful color as the box art shows.  The transfer is very good and the sound quality is generally solid considering the source material and technology available at the time were limiting factors.

7770055,5,B01GWCDFT2,"What a series! When I was a kid, I watched it on television. About 20 years ago, I acquired the VHS version. Now? The DVD. I had expected that the series would not age well. The temptation for jingoism or for too much dramatic effect struck me as likely. But I continue to enjoy this classic series. The focus of the series: the war at sea.

First, there is the sound track. The music was written by Richard Rodgers. There are some wonderful themes during the course of the 26 episode series. The series' theme song alone is a classic. Robert Russell Bennett arranged the music and conducted the then top notch NBC Symphony Orchestra (Arturo Toscanini's orchestra).

Second, the use of war footage gives the series a genuineness and gravitas. The videos add greatly to the total effect. Leonard Graves is the narrator, and has a voice that works well in that role.

There are 26 episodes, taking us from the war's outbreak (including Dunkirk, German U-boats, Pearl Harbor, etc.), to Midway to Gaudalcanal to D-Day to the Great Mariana's Turkey Shoot to the Philippines to Iwo Jima to Okinawa. . . . The war in the east and in the west are covered.

Sometimes there is a bit of jingoism or overwrought descriptions of German and Japanese actions (there were despicable acts, indeed, but sometimes the script goes over the edge). However, this is not excessive and does not really detract from the series.

This is still aging well as a concept and product.

There are also extras: discussion of the Revolutionary War up to Iraq II. I watched the Civil War extra and turned it off (never to return) when they showed a picture of General Winfield Scott Hancock while speaking of General Winfield Scott's role as the top military commander for the Union. Before that, footage from old Civil War movies was used, some being not worth inclusion. If I heard correctly, the film got General P. G. T. Beauregard's initials wrong, too. Perhaps the other extras were much better.

At any rate, an estimable series, still worth watching.",1387065600,10,2025,4.719546742209632

Another annoyance is the constant mixing of genuine combat footage with obviously staged reenactments and, often, the use of model ships and aircraft.

While it's called Victory at Sea, most of the video is on land (Marines), and much of what is at sea is staged visuals of sailors on board. We don't get nearly enough actual ship footage.

Many of the amazing battles of the war, such as Samar, are presented in a way that cuts so short, the immensity of the act and the bravery of the men is lost.  It's not that this isn't a great piece of work, it's just that what I expected was depth not found here.

7770135,5,B01GWCDFT2,"Like other reviewers, I remember and still appreciate the score theme from my youth.  Now some 60 years later, I see this series as a function of its early-1950s era, with its burgeoning anti-Communism, its leftover jingoism from the war itself, its disdain for our European Allies, and its overt racism.  Thankfully the narration, which often avoids competing with the sheer impact of the visuals, is so transparent and dated that one can read through it to the substantive information it contains.

Listen to how the score changes when referring to Japanese and Chinese. Listen to the paternalist words and tone describing our Allies.  Again, it's so obviously manipulative that one can see past it.  At least I could.

Several video clips show up in later series (The World at War, Burn's The War, World War II in HD, et al.).  We tend to forget the heavy attention to video provenance these days; this series fails to note obvious reconstructions (both Japanese and US), and it re-uses several clips for effect but not for accuracy.

It's easy for me to forgive these faults, so I give it 5 stars for having come when it did.  Others might not feel the same. For anyone wanting historical documentation, this is a must-have.

7770143,5,B01GWCDFT2,"My Dad and I used to watch this series on our 12"" tube TV every Sunday religiously at 2 PM in the early 50's (but now I'm dating myself).  But I don't remember it looking like this.  Previously the videos looked flat, like a layer of fog was positioned in front of them.  And the video quality was inconsistent throughout. But, with this release, everything has changed.  These videos are consistent, with a rich contrast evident throughout.  The blacks are rich.  I don't know if the credit goes to my new Hi Def LED TV, to editing by Mill Creek Entertainment or to the upgrade feature of my Blu-Ray player, but I'm very satisfied with the result.

The only disappointment I have is the narrative.  It sounds as shallow as it did originally. I guess the technology doesn't exist to upgrade this rudimentary sound quality to today's standards. And, as much as I love Rodger's musical score, if I had my way I would decrease its volume slightly so the narrative is stronger.  As it is now the music and the narrative seem to be competing with each other for dominance.  I believe ""background"" music should remain in the background.  But this is a relatively small detail.

The editing of the miles and miles of original video footage into the fine presentation that it is must have been extremely labor-intensive.  All in all, a real bargain at $4.99 for all 26 episodes on 3 disks.",1368921600,58,1381,4.587755102040816

7770165,5,B01GWCDFT2,"This documentery, made in the early 1950s is about the naval war against the Axis in World War II.  It is also about us-how we(the good guys) defeated them(the bad guys).  This series was completed too soon after the war to contain the history that came out long after the war.  However, this documentery shows us how we felt about the victory.  We lost a lot of men but we defeated evil.  The world was going to be a better place because of what we did.  We were proud of ourserves.  We were proud of ourselves.  And we were right-the world is a better place because of our victory.  And the world would be a better place today if we had the same attiude that America had in the early 1950s.",1368748800,,692,4.221374045801527
7770166,2,B01GWCDFT2,"If you want to see some footage of WWII, then you may be interested in this series. However, note the following:

The narration is propaganda talk; that was very disappointing to me; I didn't learn anything of substance from the narration.

The music is theatrical and loud (like they were making a movie, not a documentary).

The narrator speaks quieter than he should, so you have to turn-up the volume to hear him, and then you get blasted by the music.

About half of the footage is taken from movies or propaganda films...and that's quite obvious, and very disappointing.

After watching the first DVD in the series, I decided not to watch the rest.

7770167,5,B01GWCDFT2,"I first saw this series back in 1954 or so when it first came out on TV. My Dad, who served in the South Pacific as a infantry commander, watched it and and growing up in the Army I watched him. When it comes to the section dealing with jungle warfare he watched it very closely, then he said ""thats the way it was"". I know this series is aimed at the Navy but the producers also realized that there was a ground war going on too. There have been many other World War II documentaries made but none, in my opinion, come close to matching Victory At Sea. In case you may not know it there is also a hardback book that follows the series published in 1959 by Doubleday & Co. Needless to say I highly recommend this to anyone interested in World War II.",1367625600,,750,4.108843537414966

7770169,5,B01GWCDFT2,"The musical score alone is worth the price. However, the films of the various campaigns of World War II show the viewer that war was a near miracle to win by the allies because of the power of Germany and Japan. The people of the USA should watch these films to recognize that it was the USA that saved Civilization from abject evil. As Americans, we should be proud and be thankful to the men, most of whom were teenagers or in their incipient 20's who fought the two most powerful armies the world ever knew--and prevailed over them-thereby saving the world from a hellish decline into brutal darkness.

It's a really great production, an accurately depicting historic icon, with unusually supurb, classically sounding music accompaniment that continues to haunt listeners to this very day.

7770174,5,B01GWCDFT2,"Victory at Sea is a great documentary film about World War II as played out on the oceans and seas of the world. First, the war in the Pacific. The vastness of this largest of the world's oceans plays a major role in the unfolding story. The Japanese stretched their limited resources to the breaking point. Pearl Harbor needed to be a ""knockout"" blow to the United States and wasn't. In fact, it was the goad America needed to commit to the war. Once committed, the vast resources of this country were mobilized with astonishing speed and the fighting men and women of the United States were more than equal to the task of defeating what had been an invincible Japanese army and navy.

The strength of Victory at Sea is that it shows us the ""up close and personal"" lives of the soldiers and sailors who sailed the ships, flew the planes, and assaulted the beaches of the dozens of South Pacific Islands the Japanese had conquered. The bravery of ""the greatest generation"" is undeniable and Victory at Sea shows us the men and women of America at their courageous best.

The war in the Atlantic was dominated, at first, by the skilled German U-Boat submariners. For those who want to see what the war looked like from the German point of view, I highly recommend the great German film, Das Boot. Without the backing of the American fleet, England may well have lost the war, so effective were the Germans at destroying allied shipping.

Dunkirk should have been a German victory which seriously damaged England's ability to continue fighting effectively. Instead, the English put every boat that could sail into the water to rescue their fighting men stranded across the English Channel. With this unexpected miracle and the incredible valor of the English airforce in the Battle of Britain, England bought time as America entered the war.

Everything about this lengthy program is outstanding. Every bit of appropriate film has been reviewed and the most compelling sequences have been carefully spliced together to tell the story of Victory at Sea. Richard Rodgers' score is wonderful from beginning to end and always appropriately matched to the pictures we are watching. The narration makes clear the strategy and battle plans as the war is fought from the great naval victory at Midway in the Pacific to the spectacular landing at Normandy on the coast of France.  First time viewers have a real treat in store for them.",1363046400,32,2425,4.805755395683454
