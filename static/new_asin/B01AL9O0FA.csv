7607194,2,B01AL9O0FA,"Vinegar Syndrome has been knocking out some great oldies but I didn't care for this set. I picked up the Hypatia Lee double feature and the Pretty Peaches Trilogy.  Saw this was going on sale and picked it up.  Carol Conners is beautiful but I couldn't get into the films.  It may have been the direction but I don't know.  I think the lady who directed this, made porn for the ladies back in the day.  Great transfers but if you are not a Carol Conners fan, skip this one.  If you like these films you will not be disappointed.  Warning for some...it was a surprise that during an orgy scene in the first film, there are a few quick shots of male on male...um...you get my drift.  Hey, not knocking that lifestyle.  Just not my cup of tea and I just didn't expect it.",1462147200,7,768,4.241379310344827

7607196,4,B01AL9O0FA,"I'll bet fans of Carol Conners will love this Blu-ray - she probably sleeps with about a dozen different men in as many different scenes, so if you cut together all the scenes from both movies you'd have a heck of a good best-of-Candy compilation.  It's also pretty amazing that we have a special appearance from Wendy O. Williams in the second film, so fans of hers such as me will consider this a collector's item for sure.  The audio and film transfer quality are great - no worries there, although Blu-ray definitely reveals the ""flaws"" of the original film such as the grain, dust and scratches, etc.  Both films are on the same disc, and the menu is pretty easy to navigate.  Unfortunately there are no extras, and the ""reels"" don't provide many chapters to cue to so be careful using them, you'll possibly skip whole scenes since there are many in each film.  My only real deduction is due to a sneaky gender demerit which I'll detail below, so minus one star for that.  But I would still recommend this to fans of 70s adult cinema and especially those who want to grab any of the good ones coming out on Blu-ray and hence providing real quality.

Erotic Adventures of Candy - Candy is ridiculously hot, with large pancake sized areolas, and the first erotic scene is a delightful mix of self-love while dreaming about a fully explicit encounter nice long cuts of close action without being myopic about it, and the pumping is a good purposeful pace that takes its time and occasionally quickens slightly.  No stupid bouncy jackhammer and no bogus short stroking.  Oh and it finishes with a cream pie.  So far, so good!! The next plays more for comedy and I was indeed laughing out loud eventually I lost count of how many different men she does hardcore scenes with, but finally at 60 minutes we see a different woman for one scene.  At about 70 minutes theres an orgy scene with lots of new bodies, but be careful because it also contains what I consider to be a serious party foul (some surprise cuts of male-male oral, complete with mustaches - oh my eyes!) all due respect to those who like the free-for-all approach with their gay and straight mixed together, but for me it was an immediate boner killer with mild regurgitative side effects.  There's more Candy after that and ... well that's about it.

Candy Goes to Hollywood - Nice views of hollywood, nice all nude strip club scene near the beginning.  Then there's the hilarious dong show scene with none other than Wendy O. Williams *doing the ping pong ball trick* (in fully explicit detail, its fascinating and hysterical).  Again we have multiple scenes with Candy performing hardcore, but one of them is with a woman wearing a strap-on.  Again we finally get a different woman doing hardcore about 60 minutes in, and an orgy of new bodies at 70 minutes - but this time the women greatly outnumber the men and theres no male-male relations.  Some slightly chubby women, which I really enjoy.  Some really nice fire crotch too.  This is what I love about 70s adult cinema - very natural, full-grown women with bush, full hips, and breasts that respond to gravity and hang well according to their heft.  And some women that have a luxurious amount of chub - not bbw, but just that slight layer of padding that make them that much nicer to lie down with.",1458172800,17,3323,4.590524534686971
7607197,5,B01AL9O0FA,"Once again Vinegar Syndrome does what nobody else seems to want to try  and restores legit 35mm classic adult films
This time around you get the one and only Carol Connors in two of her most beloved and respect classics
Erotic Adventures of Candy (1978)
Candy Goes to Hollywood (1979)
scanned & Restored from 35mm Camera Negatives
I bought the blu ray direct from Vinegar Syndrome and received the film last Friday
I only watched the first film it looks phenomenal
Is this blu ray release for everyone?
Honestly no if you are millennial you are without a doubt desensitized to sex
You will not understand it there is no 2 girls 1 cup, and no actress being tied down brutally degraded just for the sake of shock and awe
This was the era of high concept ""art""
It's on the same level as the likes of Taxi Driver, Animal House and Dawn of the Dead

My biggest gripe with this release was lack of any real exclusives
They need to do a documentary on the 1970's adult industry that time period is super interesting
It was the birth of 35mm xxx making lots of money and the involvement of organized crime and the government trying to crack down on distributing the films across the country
I understand there has been lots of super interesting documentaries and even films but
Three forms of entertainment  are always super interesting The music industry, Pro Wrestling and Adult entertainment
But, what do i know i know nothing....................
Even though it's lacking any mind blowing exclusive extras I appreciate the work  Vinegar Syndrome has done thus far
Once again a real standout underground release
Vinegar Syndrome fan forever  10/10",1456185600,5,1641,4.743859649122807

8747743,5,B01AL9O0FA,The late Wendy O Williams is why I bought this. I saw her in concert year's ago during her solo tour was a great show she rocked the place. In this 70s porn classic Wendy pop's ping pong balls out of her vagina. There's other sexual situations in the show as well.,1518393600,2,264,4.096153846153846

8747747,4,B01AL9O0FA,"Classic, fun romp from the late 70s. There is a bit of creepiness in the tone due to some of the male behavior, but it is well handled by the tongue in cheek feel. Orgy sequence from the 2nd film is excellent.",1495411200,,209,4.0

8747749,5,B01AL9O0FA,"One of the best of the ""Classic Erotica"" films, this one follows the adventures of Candy as she explores sex, and in the second installment goes to Hollywood to be a star, turning out to be involved with sleazy actors and agents. Definitely worth watching, as Carol Connors does a fantastic job of portraying Candy. ( and that's saying something in a porno film)",1487289600,,362,4.671875
8747750,5,B01AL9O0FA,"Very good transfer of the films to DVD.  Nice to see the original trailers, too.  I can't imagine there would be anything else they could add in the way of extra features to this double feature, since I doubt there's footage of interviews from the time or that the star of these two films, Carol Connors, would consent to an interview these days.",1480896000,,346,4.476190476190476
8747751,5,B01AL9O0FA,Pure entertainment. The narrative is simple. The cast is fun and attractive. The production is 1st class. The sex is good and wholesome. A great classic for my library.,1477526400,2,168,4.827586206896552
