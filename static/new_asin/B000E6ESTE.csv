2502927,4,B000E6ESTE,"This film stars Susan Sarandon, Sam Neill, and Emily Blunt. It's a thriller, with some similar themes to The Hand That Rocks The Cradle. SS plays an artist mother, married to SN, who fears that SN's new assistant (EB) is trying to move in entirely on her husband and family. It's an Australian film (also set in Australia), so the pace is a little slower, which actually is a good touch to a thriller. There's a twist at the end, which was entirely unexpected by me.",1163721600,4,466,4.430232558139535
2502928,3,B000E6ESTE,"Most things are wrong in this thriller.
It starts with the title, which must have been selected by a robot. No relation to the story.
The casting is wrong. As much as I am a Susan Sarandon admirer, she just should not play young mothers any more; she is about 20 years too old for the part. Sorry, Susan, make that 10 years.
That said, she does a marvellous job as a woman on a journey into nervous wreckdom.
The script makes hash of a story which might have been saveable, it has good elements. The wasp espisode is underutilized, it has potential. As it is done, it is amateurish and weak.
The solution to the riddle, w/o wanting to give it away, is surprising enough, but not entirely plausible as far as the ""bad guy"" is concerned. It is not fully in character, which falls back on the casting and the actor.
The closing scene is sort of a minor quote from Psycho, but lacks the creepyness of Anthony Perkins in his cell.",1157500800,13,925,4.32183908045977
2502929,4,B000E6ESTE,"This is a really good movie that deserved to get more publicity and reach a wider audience. And it deserved a better title. ""Irresistible"" is misleading. The descriptive blurb on the DVD cover is similarly misleading. Contrary to what these summaries imply, it's immediately apparent that this movie isn't simply about the possibility that some crazed ex-boyfriend is stalking a woman. We realize that something more complex is going on here. The tension starts to build almost from the opening scenes as Susan Sarandon begins to get the uneasy feeling that someone is in her house, that someone is in fact invading her house on a regular basis, stealing small items, leaving deadly little twists as tokens of having been there.

Is she imagining this? Have the pressures of her work as book illustrator, with deadlines to meet and repressed memories to dredge up - started to unbalance her?

The viewer is kept guessing. Along the way though, we are taken into the life of a truly decent mother and wife. For once, it is heartening to keep company with a featured mother. She is fun and a true friend to her children and husband, without abdicating her role as responsible adult.

This is a well-written movie, done in the classic tradition of mystery/thrillers. All the loose ends get tied up and whatever twists there are along the way play fair with the audience. And as ever, Susan Sarandon has a compelling screen presence. Anything she's in HAS to be good.",1155772800,11,1463,4.820717131474104
2502930,5,B000E6ESTE,"I can't believe this movie didn't get more hype.  Its a psychological thriller in the genre of Bette Davis flicks.  And, of course, it doesn't hurt to have Susan Saradan as the leading lady.  I would highly recommend this movie.",1151884800,6,228,4.65
2502931,1,B000E6ESTE,"A chopped up suspense flick in which the suspense is ""How long can I stand to sit here and watch this thing?""  I was heartened at first, as the story starts with a bang and draws you in...and then it drags you on and on until what you really want is to see ""The End"" only so you can go and do something constructive, like turning the disc into a craft project.  Characters (especially Poor Sam Neill's haplessly helpless husband) change with the wind, the plot twists pile up for no other reason than that, if they weren't there you could stop watching and step on the disc, the action careens from scene to scene without a whole lot of connective material.  I'm not asking for explanation: we are given explanation enough for three movies.  It simply is done in such a herky-jerky  manner rather than seamlessly being slipped into the script.  And then there are those plot twists.

All I can say is ""Sam and Sue must've owed Ann Turner a favor.""  I'm so glad I rented this from the library and didn't spend actual cash on it.",1151107200,6,1027,4.396825396825397
2502932,3,B000E6ESTE,"IRRESISTIBLE is a strange little thriller, filmed in Australia with Susan Sarandon and Sam Neill in the leading roles.  The sometimes clever, sometimes implausible, script finds Neill's new assistant (Emily Blunt in a seductive performance) trying to take over Sarandon's life--and Neill in the process.

Starting with minor things like taking dresses, pictures, etc., it mushrooms into a more dangerous threat.  Credit the writers for coming up with a clever twist as to Blunt's true identity.

Sarandon doesn't give one of her best performances, but she's a pro and makes the most of her role, while Neill plays the suffering husband adequately.

Overall, I found it entertaining.",1147305600,12,682,5.336448598130841
2502933,4,B000E6ESTE,"IRRESISTIBLE is a little film from Australia with big ideas and a clumsy script.  The story itself is good with enough variation from the usual thriller scripts to make it enjoyable, but the writing borders on improvisation and doesn't provide the motivation for the development of the story to flow smoothly enough to maintain the credibility of the characters.

Set in contemporary Melbourne, Australia, the story begins in media res with our heroine Sophie (Susan Sarandon), a successful illustrator, wife of an equally important architect (Sam Neill), and mother to two little girls, hearing noises and finding odd incidents.  Recovering from the death of her beloved mother and caring for her grieving father (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell), Sophie's stress factor is further heightened by the fact that she has a block about the illustrations for a book whose deadline is nearing.  Her husband is supportive and encourages her to get away from her problems by attending a party given by a new associate of his at the firm - the bright and beautiful Mara (Emily Blunt) - who just happens to be wearing the same new dress Sophie has purchased for the party.  The two meet, dance together, drink together, but innuendoes have started: party guests offer condolences for her mothers death but also suggest she join AA for her 'drinking problem'.

Sophie's mind continues to fragment as she imagines she is being stalked by Mara because of events that happen in her house, with her wardrobe, and with paranoia that her husband and Mara are having an affair.  She decides to observe Mara closely, discovering facts that feed her paranoia, and is caught in Mara's house - and arrested.  From there the story disintegrates into revelation of facts that border on melodrama with ill-defined motivations marring every scene. To reveal the ultimate nidus for the story's plot would rob the viewer of what little surprises there are here.

Ann Turner could have used a script doctor before shooting this film, as the story is fine: it is just clumsy and not finessed. But once again Susan Sarandon proves she is such a fine actress that she can pull off even a spotty script and create a credible character.  Sam Neill and Emily Blunt likewise do the best with what they are given with lines and direction.  This is not a bad movie at all, just one that needed a bit of surgery before placing it on the screen,  and the film is well worth watching for Sarandon fans.  She still is one of our finest actresses on the screen today.  Grady Harp, April 06",1145491200,20,2538,4.817972350230415
2502934,4,B000E6ESTE,"No wonder Hollywood is having a bad year. It's sad that a film like this goes straight to video with absolutely no advance publicity to speak of. Do not be fooled. This production holds its own and delivers an exceptional thriller with a great cast. No tricks. No bizarre special effects or shaky camera angles. Ms. Sarandon goes for the gut and gets the viewer into it with ease. Sam Neill gives a fine performance along with the rest of the cast including the cat.

  Any negativity here can be applied to wardrobe. Ms. Sarandon does not fare well in canvas workpants with a multitude of pockets. It detracts from the grip of the storyline especially when one knows she is more than capable of displaying her  sensuallity.

  Whether it was intended or not the sex scene with Mr. Neill is hilarious and serves as a campy sort of comic relief.

  All in all we have a fine mystery with some nice twists. Don't miss it.",1145491200,3,919,4.481927710843373
2502985,1,B000E6ESTE,"Very lame. Bizarre script. Strange plot which doesn't quite make sense.  It's a cross between ""what lies beneath"" and ""fatal attraction"" although nowhere near as good as either of those. Very disappointing.",1375833600,,206,5.4375
2502986,3,B000E6ESTE,"If you like good thrillers and suspense then you'll enjoy this movie.
Susan Sarandon comes across as a wee bit on the stupid side which I am not used to seeing.
All in all a good movie, maybe not Oscar worthy though.  lol",1351382400,,221,4.1395348837209305
2502987,2,B000E6ESTE,"It amazes me that such fine actors participated in such a bust of a film.  This is so excruciatingly bad, even painful, to watch that I could barely watch it to the end.

Take a beautiful, accomplished if somewhat ditzy older woman, throw in a mid-life marriage crisis, and a mysterious younger beauty.  Add fear and possible insanity, titillation, and some haphazard explanations thrown in that don't fit with the plot, and you have a disaster of incoherence, eventually leading to violence and wholly unbelievable pseudo-resolution.  But at least the actors were fine.  OK, the ending does add a nice twist.  So 2 stars instead of one.

Alas, this film simply doesn't work.  Don't get it, don't even rent it.",1325548800,,710,4.858333333333333
2502988,2,B000E6ESTE,"I bought this movie based on the Amazon reviews and the star power I like both Susan Sarandon and Sam Neil.

The movie is very slow (which doesn't bother me) however its not well written and its not very interesting.  The viewer comes into a story that feels like its been in progress for a long time.  We're supposed to question, I guess, if Sarandon is unstable or being stalked.  Then out of the blue we're given a story hook that is a complete gimick for explanation.

I doggedly stayed with the film but the ending wasn't satisfying and the story felt like it was being written along the way.

I really like the actors, Emily Blunt (a hoot in the Devil Wears Prada), Neil (you MUST see him in the Tudors season 1) and Sarandon.  I don't need bang bang shoot em up to enjoy films.  If the writing is there so am I.  This film is not worthy of such a talented cast.",1315440000,,868,4.212121212121212
2502989,5,B000E6ESTE,"This is a terrific film, never released to the theaters for some unknown reason, which has suspense and a lot of thought provoking moments.  Susan Sarandon is terrific portraying a temperamental artist who is also a stay at home mom who is troubled by strange happenings in her home.  Sam Neill portrays her emotionally supportive and loving husband who is perplexed by her strange mood swings pertaining to her suspicions.  Emily Blunt really steals the show as husband Neill's information technologist right hand at work who also plays a large part in the mysterious happenings that abound in the film.

I recommend this film very highly.  You will enjoy it for its acting, its surprising plot twists and turns and for a wonderful quixotic ending.  Purchase it today.  It will become one of your favorite DVD collectibles.",1269561600,,824,4.970802919708029
2502990,4,B000E6ESTE,"I loved this movie!! I was a little worried at first that it was going to be a bit slow paced and un-eventfull however I was pleasantly surprised at the overall movie. Emily Blunt is a real standout in the film. In fact I have loved every movie I have seen her in so far. If your after a great thriller, then this one won't disappoint.",1220140800,,335,4.090909090909091
2502991,5,B000E6ESTE,"Sam Neill and Susan Sarandon are terrific in this tale of lust and family virtues!
The storm clouds thicken over this Australian and his American-born wife.
I found this film to be comparable to ""Sixth Sense"" in the fact that the surprises never stop.
I highly recommend it.",1216512000,,274,4.729166666666667
2502992,1,B000E6ESTE,The film has nothing to show off its name.just the character susan is needed to examplify how wrong the casting for film was made,1191283200,,129,4.416666666666667
2502993,3,B000E6ESTE,"Susan Sarandon helped save this film from total disaster. Not only was the title out of place, but the storyline was just silly. Susan is an author married to a businessman (sam neill). He works with a younger woman who clearly is not all there. There is not alot of guessing to be done throughout the movie, but I have to admit the ending was pretty good.

It's hard to believe that Sarandon worked with the script writer for over 6 months to get the script to her liking. Either the script was shocking to begin with, or she was not thinking.

A movie which went straight to video in alot of countries.",1184112000,3,604,4.336283185840708
2502994,1,B000E6ESTE,"As you watch(if you can)this ridiculous thriller (and I use that term very loosely) set in the 'burbs, keep in mind Susan Sarandon helped fine-tune the script. Surely one of the greatest actresses of our generation couldn't be so desperate as to wing it down here to Australia to involve herself in this sordid mess?
The only thing this nonsense proves is that Emily Blunt is just getting started...I kept expecting to see Sharon Stone peeping over a hedge and nodding at her with approval.",1184112000,3,490,4.776470588235294

8106811,5,B000E6ESTE,This movie did not get much attention in the US as it is an Australian film. It's great for people who like a combination indie-style movie with Lifetime-style domestic drama. Loved the two female leads -- Susan Sarandon and Emily Blunt. Kind of a female-centric movie.,1444867200,,269,4.869565217391305
8106812,5,B000E6ESTE,"This is a suprisingly absorbing movie with good performances and satisfyingly escalating suspense.  Sarandon does an excellent job at portraying the gradual unease and increasing paranoia of her character.  The story centers around an accomplished illustrator with two kids and a happy marriage.  Her life appears idyllic, but the recent death of her mother, deadline pressures and sleep deprivation have led her to forgetfulness and uncertainty.  As she deteriorates, she begins to suspect that someone has been in her house.  Items begin to disappear, and she questions the motives of her husband's co-worker, who seems intent on invading her life.  Yet when she attempts to discuss the accumulation of odd occurrences, her husband dismisses her concerns.  The pace of this movie allows the tension to build as Sarandon struggles to prove her sanity and trust her intuition.  Twists and turns keep this movie rushing toward the unexpected conclusion.  This is a slow and deliberate psychological thriller that succeeds because of Sarandon.",1434153600,,1041,5.416149068322981
8106813,2,B000E6ESTE,"This should be called 'incredible' - because it's not credible. How did 2 top actors end up in such a clumsy movie? Why is it a mishmash of (all the bad bits of) other thrillers? Why isn't it thrilling? Why are the characters so one-dimensional?  Why is the 'twist' so predictable & cliched? And why does Susan Sarandon, at 60, play the mother of 2 little girls? I could hardly bear to watch it - I was embarrassed for the entire cast, except possibly the cat.",1420848000,,460,4.348837209302325

8106815,4,B000E6ESTE,"An intriguing story concept that almost succeeds cinematically. I enjoyed the movie but it really could have been much much more. The acting is superb and the characters are believable. Emily Blount's sexuality emanates a supernatural glamour, a sort of psychic syrup that enraptures and traps Sam Neil. I really thought she was a sorceress using her powers sparingly and deftly. The first and second acts are well done but the third act is unsatisfying. It doesn't live up to the promise of the where the story seems to be going.",1386201600,,530,4.835164835164835
8106816,5,B000E6ESTE,Why has America overlooked such a great Australian actor like William McInnes.  Small part in this movie but such a powerful performance.  He is a magnificent method actor.  He gets into the skin of his character and his acting becomes so genuine and realistic.  I only wish he was in more movies so I could see his performance on screen.,1380067200,,338,4.583333333333333
