Andrews Blu-ray Review: There is something to be said for having a heart; especially this 3D animation film with a brimming core can make one instantly look past all else and fall in love with it. No more is this the case than with animation, think of PIXARs best output or the incomparable work of Studio Ghibli, those studios deal in films with heart, warmth and emotion beneath their animated sparkle. Indeed animated features nowadays are expected to look fantastic but the competition dictates that the characters and plot be almost as polished. However, as we said at the start, heart can mean a great deal and whilst Belgian-American-French production The House of Magic 3D is also known as Thunder and the House of Magic outside the UK, and boasts a simplistic narrative, it comes with a rare amount of genuine joy that will please all ages.

The plot sees a ginger cat [later named Thunder is voiced by Murray Blue] abandoned at the side of the road; scared and lost he looks for a home and finds a rather dark looking old house. This house belongs to a rather eccentric but kind-hearted old magician named Lawrence [Doug Stone], who is surrounded by all manner of magical toys, critters and trinkets. But all is not well when Lawrences calculating estate agent nephew Daniel [Grant George] comes snooping. The plot is pretty standard in set-up and many may notice similarities to films like Bolt. There is also the usual sub-plot of the newcomer Thunder being given a hard time by locals the grouchy rabbit Jack and his friend Maggie the Mouse in not wanting to be out shadowed as in Toy Story. That being said, in spite of a few clichs, this film is directed towards a pure family market and when it comes to magical moments, it offers plenty of its own. The 3D animation is what carries The House of Magic. The camera glides and swoops as Thunder slides down a banister, birds fly through the air and all kinds of objects are lobbed towards the viewer including pancakes, donuts and gobstoppers.

The films cast of characters are not the deepest but each one is eminently likable and kids may have a hard time choosing their favourite, although the speechless little light bulb man, Edison, has to be a top choice. Thunder is voiced well but sparingly by Blue and mostly it is the smoothly lovely animation that does a lot of the talking. Thunder makes a fine lead to the film and despite some meaner moments, watching Jack [George Babbit] and Maggie [Shanelle Gray] change their opinion of Thunder is surprisingly effective. Lawrence is a brilliant human centre to the story and thinks the zaniness of Doc Emmett Brown meets the happiness of Mister Geppetto and while his estate agent nephew is not the most memorable villain, he has his crazed moments. The characters, like the plot, don't reinvent the wheel but they work well in a very sweet and colourful film.

From a brilliant Halloween-esque haunting scene to some excellent 3D thrills, this house is visually majestic. There are nice messages of old school entertainment being timeless and an idea of embracing your childlike delight. There are a few touching moments in the film pertaining to finding a real family and even when the film feels familiar it doesnt hammer home its points or rely on lazy humour. Ramin Djawadis generous score backs a rather nostalgic little film that is littered with some surprising and older popular music. The House of Magic 3D reminds one of A Monster in Paris 3D, in that it is not anything that pushes animated boundaries but offers a great big warm centre that will make it an absolute winner with children and adults of all ages will be smiling along with them. A really lovely 3D animation and thoroughly entertaining.

There is a freewheeling exhilaration in the way co-directors Ben Stassen and Jeremy Degruson embraces the technology that becomes irresistible and sustains interest as the predictable story starts to drag and grow repetitive. A soundtrack of vintage hits from the likes of Madness and Shakin Stevens adds to the high spirits and should bring a smile of recognition to an adult audience.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  The House of Magic 3D is crisp clean animation featuring details down to the hair of Thunder himself and gets 10 out of 10 for the stunning 3D 1080p encoded image. While the image is sharp and well manufactured, there is a sense of it seeming reserved. The image feels like it is almost to the point of being pretty vibrant. Thats just a personal observation. The picture is pretty grand though, and displays the animation as Im sure it was intended. This is a 3D animation film, so of course the depth is well above average. There are many stunning in your face scenes that follow things like a rail or rope that are the big highlights of this transfer. Theres also plenty of good depth revolving around the staircase in the foyer of the old house. Blacks are solid and do a real good job of shading. Not much detail is hidden by the black levels on the transfer. Colours stick out plenty and real good and give the feel of Technicolor. They seem to be based on a more simplified palette, making it pretty easy to put all the focus into this simplified colour scheme. But most important, there is no artefacts. The film opts for its fair share of 3D ""gimmicks"" with things like point of view shots, looming objects and various items being thrown directly at the camera serving up a nice amount of visual immersion. Some of the best moments, however, come courtesy of simpler techniques like foreground objects offering a good sense of depth back into the frame. The characters all are nicely rounded and have appropriate heft, making their emergence out of the frame toward the viewer in the more obvious 3D moments with a lot of fun. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is a pretty solid track. It doesnt do anything outstanding, but it more than gets the job done. The surround sound effects like the crashing of the wrecking ball machine and thunder are some of the things in the film enhanced by the subwoofer. The Surround Sound Presentation has light usage in the rear speakers, mainly ambient noise and muted score. There is some solid left and right interplay though. But most important the Dialogue Reproduction is clear, clean and front heavy, which really enhances this beautiful 3D animation film. The 5.1 mixes offer a wealth of nice immersion with some really great sound effects, some tied to the fun with the little inventions Lawrence surrounds himself with, and the film's playful score. Perhaps a bit misleadingly, some Blu-ray covers advertise music by Selena Gomez, but her ""Hit the Lights"" is simply used as part of the closing credits underscore. Fidelity is excellent, and dynamic range is quite wide as well. Ramin Djawadis busy background score, along with some pop tunes and some classical pieces worked into the mix, get nice spread through the fronts and rears. One terrific effect with a fiery paper dragon gets some neat panning effects across the sound field, but one wishes more opportunities had been found for that kind of sweeping sound effect.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Theatrical Trailer [1080p] [1.78:1] [5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio] [1:55] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer and is quite stunning and as good as the actual animation film, but sadly it is not in 3D.

Finally, this energetic animated family adventure film may be short on exposition, but it makes up for it with its playful attitude, exceptional use of 3D effects, and good-natured main character and I know children will fall in love with this 3D animation film and I bet they will pester their parents to put it on far too many times. No matter what your format preference is and STUDIOCANAL has brought out something truly special. Sadly the only Extra with this particular Blu-ray is the Original Theatrical Trailer, but as an added bonus it is still stunning, especially being presented in the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. Although this 3D animation film is mainly aimed at children than a general all audience affair, but hey, it is also aimed at the older generation, as there is a lot of adult humour, that will go over the beads of the younger audience. Anyway I really think everyone will enjoy the 3D magic of The House of Magic and I know you will want to view this several times, as there is far too much action going on with just one viewing. Technical merits are very strong, and The House of Magic 3D comes with a great pedigree. Highly Recommended!

6547085,4,B00M24YBXE,"The animated film, Thunder and the House of Magic is directed by Ben Stassen Jeremy Degruson. The story is about a small, orange cat named, Thunder, who is abandoned by his owners. While wandering the neighborhood, he happens upon a supposedly haunted house, which is full of magical toys and an old magician.

Although, Thunder is quickly accepted into the house by the elder performer, he is not immediately approved of by the rest of the group. Through several adventures and troubles arising with the magician's not-so-nice nephew, who is trying to sell the house against the magician's wishes, the group begins to bond.

My favorite scene is when the old magician does a magic show for children in a local hospital. The magic is funny, imaginative and it is sweet that he does a show for kids in need.

Parents should know that this film is not for little kids! In the beginning, Thunder is chased by a scary dog, almost gets hit by cars and nearly falls out of a tree. In the end, he is thought to be dead for a short period of time. There is also a bit of bad language.
Therefore, I recommend this movie for ages 9 to 14.

I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars for loveable characters and an original storyline.  It is available now on DVD! Reviewed by Katie G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more youth reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.",1414972800,16,1340,4.453061224489796

I randomly selected it on Netflix one day trying to find something other than the same 3 tv shows/movies to watch and within the first 5 minutes, he was laughing so hard. I'm only rating this a 4 because some of the things said/done are a little rough. Such as [spoilers] the fact that Thunder was abandoned on the side of the road via his ""family"" opening the car door and throwing a jingle ball for him to chase, Jack the rabbit and Maggie the mouse trying to sabotage/kill him and the fact that Daniel the nephew really doesn't learn his lesson he just gets his butt kicked. [/spoilers] While I'm not one to worry too much about messages movies and tv shows send some people may not like it.",1498694400,,745,4.405797101449275
6547097,2,B00M24YBXE,"The nephew character in this movie belongs in cartoon prison, and is seriously unhinged, which is kinda odd in a kids' movie.  I don't care that he says the word ""damn"" a bunch of times, but he brings a shotgun into a relative's home, and then blasts away at Thunder the cat, destroying property willy nilly that he intends to sell.  (It's appalling due to the violence, and also due to the fact that he can't hit a cat that's only a few feet away with a damn shotgun) Somehow he also manages to fully operate a wrecking ball (something every realtor knows how to do apparently), and continues destroying the home he wishes to sell.  It's strange.  I can handle some silliness, but the level of nonsensical violence in this movie is a bit over the top for me.
I won't put it on again for any kids in the future, and am glad I watched it on Netflix and didn't buy it.",1497830400,,866,4.262195121951219

6547105,3,B00M24YBXE,"We first saw this movie on Netflix, and my daughter absolutely loves it. I actually enjoy it, too. It receives three stars due to some of the language.(I don't understand why they decided to use that kind of language in a children's movie.) But,If my daughter were to rate it, the movie would be a 5 star movie. Thunder is an adorable stray cat that ends up living with a retired magician. The magician's nephew wants to sell the old man's house. Thunder and his friends do what they can to stop the nephew, and save the house. The issue is that the nephew repeatedly uses language not suitable for small children to hear, and then repeat. There is also a couple of scenes that may be a bit scary to young children. That being said, the story over all is good, but I would suggest watching it with your children when they see it for the first time.",1488758400,,848,4.339622641509434

6547109,4,B00M24YBXE,"It doesnt happen often but every now and again a CG animated feature film comes onto the scene without much hype, promotional budget or even the involvement of a major studio yet still manages to display mastery over the art.  Such is the case with StudioCanals Thunder and the House of Magic.  You may not have heard much about this one but that is no reason to avoid giving it a look.  What it lacks in hype, it more than makes up for in heart.

The House of Magic (Thunder and The House of Magic in the United States) is a 2013 3D Belgian-French computer-animated film that clocks in at 84-minutes and enjoyed a global release.  Here in the United States, distribution was handled by Shout! Factory and believe it or not, it did get a modest theatrical run before making its DVD debut.

It was built off a budget $34-million and thankfully did not depend on its USA gross (where it took in an abysmal $4,091) to be profitable.  On the global scale it fared much better; $64,197,205.

The story tells of an abandoned tabby who seeks shelter in a ramshackle mansion believed by the local animals to be haunted. Instead, it turns out to be the home of elderly, semi-retired magician named Lawrence, who shares his living quarters with some of the animals he uses in his performances as well as a litany of sentient toys.

The animals living on the premises are none-too-quick to welcome another critter into the fold and a good portion of the beginning of the film is dedicated to Thunders trials and tribulations from being first abandoned by humans and then rejected by his fellow-animals.

All is not bleak, however, as Lawrence (Doug Stone) is depicted as a great admirer of cats and manages to integrate humble Thunder into his routines in short order.

While hes accepted by the houses rightful owner, alpha rabbit Jack (George Babbit) and his mouse partner-in-crime Maggie (Shanelle Gray), still plot to evict the cat from the premises.  Its only after an accident puts poor Lawrence in the hospital that the feuding animals must unite to keep the property from being sold off by Lawrence's real-estate-agent nephew Danny.

If this all sounds a little light on plot, it is but this is one of those truly rare, rare films that manages to exceed its plot limitations by simply being charming in all the areas that count.  The visuals are crisp, the textures rich and diverse and the animation simply beautiful.  So much so in fact that youll marvel at all of the personality theyve managed to capture in silent characters, like a little light-bulb -headed toy named Edison.

Younger viewers will enjoy the ride but not simply because its a bright animated piece but because everything here just sort of clicks perfectly into place.  Some of the action sequences are loosely reminiscent of the climax of the first Home Alone but this isn't to be mistaken for relying upon visual gags to be humorous either.  The characters are memorable, their cause worthy and the subliminal technical aspects of the production (vocal performance, mouth animations and scoring) are all top-notch; easily on par with some of the best coming out of Hollywood.

In conclusion, Thunder and the House of Magic joins a very select group of CG animated feature films like A Monster in Paris and The Book of Life where budgetary restriction and a lack of industry-hype cannot restrain the passion and vision of the artists involved.",1487116800,,3412,4.762308998302207

6547139,5,B00M24YBXE,"A really nice story with a lot of great characters, a good villain, and demo quality 3d. Suitable for little kids and grown-ups alike. The 3d format is as good as other reviewers say it is. The cat, Thunder, is immediately lovable and some good underlying lessons about making snap judgements of others, and it never being too late to do what you love to do.

The movie Hugo has killer 3D Depth and a Christmas carol with Jim Carrey are excellent. .This is my top 5 list..If you and your family enjoy 3D as much as mine .Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to all 5 of these superior 3D movies..I review all my bluray 3D movies on an 80inch curved samsung 4k 3D led tv with Active glasses from 9Ft away dead center of the screen with a 4k up converting blu-ray player and paradigm 12 inch sub and paradigm surround sound system..Enjoy..,1453420800,23,1131,4.289719626168225

We seem to notice something new each time we watch it that we didn't notice before. Very well done. I don't like animated movies but this is one I can actually watch without too much boredom. Have been watching on Netflix then one night netflix wasn't working but our son wanted ""cats!"" Tried Amazon Prime video but they gave us the 1 day rental instead of the ""buy video"" that we attempted to purchase. So, it's the home DVD to the rescue. Will probably have to order extra copies to have on hand. :)",1437782400,,630,4.130081300813008
6547171,1,B00M24YBXE,"Very disappointed!  The first time they said ""damn"" I thought I surely must have misheard. The second time they said it I turned it off.  Based on what I've read, it is only said twice, which is three times too many.  Apparently, later in the film the cat is chased around by a guy with a shotgun and shot at at close range.  I am glad I did not make it that far, that would have terrified my little one.  Anyone want to buy a used copy of the DVD?",1437696000,2,448,3.933333333333333

It holds the atmospheric tension for the first few minutes when you think the House of Magic is a House of Horrors, I won't go further to spoiler the plot. The ""kitty-eye"" viewpoint of the protagonist (Thunder) as he climbs trees, slides don bannisters and walks around is a really clever bit of animation. The music soundtrack is well selected with old 80's stuff, classical and everything in between. Great flick.",1426377600,,497,4.790697674418604

For the record, the dog refers to thunder as mi bro not negro. the animation is beautiful. The characters are likeable.

8669747,2,B00M24YBXE,"My kids love magic tricks and they love cats.  How can you screw that up?  It wasn't easy, but directors Jeremy Degruson and Ben Stassen demonstrated why Pixar continues to knock it out of the park and nWave Pictures...doesn't.

This film has all the ingredients that my kids should love: a spooky magic house, a kindly old magician (Doug Stone), an adorable cat protagonist (Brianne Siddall), and a motley cast of characters that includes a rabbit (George Babbit), a mouse (Shanelle Gray), two lovebirds, and a host of steampunk-inspired robots. Cute, right?  Poor Lawrence the magician doesn't realize his grasping nephew Daniel (Grant George) is planning to toss him into a retirement home and sell the magical house. Standard stuff for a kid's movie.  Well, it would be except...

This is a movie where the bad guy shouts ""damn cat!"" over and over. This is a movie where Daniel tries to murder Thunder (Brianne Siddall) by shooting him with a shotgun. This is a movie where Daniel going into anaphylactic shock due to his allergy to cats is played for laughs. This is a movie where 3D is demonstrated at every turn by point-of-view shots and stuff flying at the screen -- and freaky Halloween sequence in which the movers are scared out of the house, but really it's like a creepy Disney ride instead.

It's got all the right elements, but it simply doesn't gel.  My kids didn't like it at all, and if your kids are afraid of Disney's Haunted Mansion ride or aren't fond of attempted cat-murder, they won't either.",1533686400,,1518,4.745247148288973
