8596496,5,B00DQVU52S,"As a wanna be jazz guitarist I was delighted to see this project brought to life by Bob.  The artists in this film are some of my all-time jazz heros, well known and lesser known. I have had the privilage to meet, sit in with and get lessons from some of these players who in my opinion represent the best of what jazz is today. I see Bob at many venues taking pictures that capture these moments of artistry that will never happen again.  My hat is off to you Bob for preserving these most memorable moments and in an incredibly artistic way.
Keep Jazz Alive,
Dave",1375574400,,565,4.271028037383178
8596497,5,B00DQVU52S,"I am very particular about what I watch.....I love music and I love creative warmth. This film is filled with the warmth of the music and an insight into the man. The best musicians I know, step aside and allow the music to flow through them.....this film left me feeling as if I had just been introduced to and spent a lovely evening with Bob Barry.....soaking in his jazz genius. Thank you to Dailey Pike for the beautiful film.",1375315200,,430,4.455696202531645
8596498,5,B00DQVU52S,"Some of us have dreams.  Some of us fulfill our dreams.  Some of us don't.  And some of us allow our dreams to change as we do.

That is Bob Barry.  A man who let his artistic dreams change from actor to entertainer to world class photographer.  Join him on this last trip, unless he dreams something else, of his life.

And while you at it see some great photos and hear some great music.

A must for anyone who loves Jazz,",1375228800,,424,4.085365853658536
