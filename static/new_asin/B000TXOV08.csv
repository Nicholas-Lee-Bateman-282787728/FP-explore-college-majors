The 300 year old tradition of creating relaxing fantasy through dance, song, witty conversation, playful laughter as a game is Geiko art. Individual Maiko (sheltered apprentices) and Geiko (independent geisha) are interviewed and shadowed during arduous training in walking, sitting, serving, singing, dancing, shamisen, wearing kimono, tea ceremony, ikebana and extensive reading as they evolve into informed attentive listeners. With age, Geiko become more proficient in massaging the male ego, creating a fantasy world of admiration and confidentiality for relaxation.

The first geisha in ochiya (tea houses) were male, providing entertainment for oiran (courtesan prostitutes) and their patrons. With time, the separate profession of geisha became dominated by females.

Traditionally Maikos began training in dance at 6years 6months 6days. Modern Maikos (bright clothes, obi to floor, red collar) apprentice for 5 years under the protection of a geiko house mother, older sister mentor Geiko (white collar) and tea house managers, before ""turning the collar"" as an independent Geiko.

The oldest working Geiko is 94years. Geisha (arts person) profession is the lifelong perfection of the art of speaking wisely, listening closely, knowing how to keep a secret. Gossip is the taboo domain of prostitutes; discretion defines geiko integrity.

Geiko are self supporting, independent, hard working with only 2 days off per month. If geiko marry they must leave the profession.

Ozashiki (3 hour geiko tea party) are closed, secret, first timers are always refused, one may attend only if invited. The bill is sent later and never questioned.

Shamisen (3 string musical instrument) cost $10,000 each; a Geiko may have 7-10 shamisen which are in constant need of repair.

Maiko sleep on an omaku wooden pillow to protect hair for a week until next hair dressing.

Handpainted silk kimono are $10,000-$50,000 each. Each geiko requires kimono for each season and ceremony, having approximately 200 kimono. Selecting and wearing kimono, obi, ties, kanzashi (hair picks) is an expression of Geiko taste and elegance.

Only white black and red face paint create the geiko mask, less red with age. The unpainted nape of the neck is considered highly alluring. The painted mask indicates a geiko is working; the painted smile is a semiotic barrier between flirtatious ozashiki fantasy and reality.

Otokosu (dressers) help geiko drape kimono properly and tie the obi. Femininity is expressed by the gentle fold of kimono revealing the nape of the neck.

Gei means art, sha means person. Geiko are well-informed conversationalists, rigorously trained dancers, singers, musicians; performances are restrained, mysterious and elegant.

Japanese men realize ozashiki is a dream world where they go to escape and decompress. The geiko's job is to be certain everyone has fun. When geiko flirt wearing the painted mask, she is an actress, it is a very fun game, not serious, when you leave, it is over. Like Elvis or Marilyn Monroe when geiko perform they flirt with and charm the audience, when the patron leaves the tea house, the game is over.

Men come to unwind at ozashiki then return to the real world. Ozashiki bill at $600-1000/person/evening sent to the patron later; the bill is never questioned. Financial records are maintained by the Maiko Union to determine prizes for Maiko earning the most money each year.

Ikebana, arrangement of flowers, expresses the changing seasons and mood and is an important geiko art.

Yasaka Shrine is where respects are paid, prayers offered by Gion maiko and geiko. Shaking out numbers gives one a fortune; bad fortunes on white paper are rejected, tied to a tree outside the shrine to be burned. Ema are wooden boards for calligraphing prayers to hang outside the shrine.

The wig maker can make a face look thinner or fuller, enhancing attractiveness. Each wig is $5000 and costs $200 each month when it is dressed. Each geiko needs at least 3 wigs.

Geiko may be requested to accompany patrons to outside restaurants, or attend parties outside Gion ochiya. Geiko always travel first class in private train cars; they receive ""flower money"" for outside arrangements.

Kyogin, Kabuki, Noh actors and Geiko are entertainer colleagues. Geiko lifestyle has strict taboos.

Fans, tea houses, bed head, maiko moments, make up, walking, the Geiko Union, wigs, otokosu dressers, alcohol and secrets are covered in this informative video of the hard working lives of Geiko.

This Discovery Channel documentary visits Maiko and Geiko in their homes, at study, at work and asks about future dreams, big sister-little sister relationship, finances of Geiko. Few modern patrons are sufficiently educated in traditional song and dance to appreciate the subtle grace of an evening hosted by geisha. The living works of art known as Geiko may soon disappear.

Geisha live in an illusory world of dignity, grace, respect, innocence and laughter as guardians of culture and fragile tradition.

The Secret World of Geisha DVD provides a detailed view of these secretive icons, living works of art whose tradition and the arts they support (silk kimono painters, dance masters, wig makers, hair dressers, shamisen makers, otokosu dressers) may not survive into the next century.

Intriguing look at private lives of Maiko and Geiko seldom seen even by Japanese of living works of art, Geisha.
