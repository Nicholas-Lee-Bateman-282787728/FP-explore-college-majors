5462720,5,B00AO686E2,"I am so excited to see that this movie is FINALLY being brought out as a part of the masterpiece collection. I was just complaining to my best friend yesterday that Disney only offered it as the ""original animated classic"" that wasn't remastered for picture quality and sound the way all of the other Disney animated movies have been. I own this movie on VHS but never bought the DVD because I kept thinking that they were sure to re-release it as one of their Diamond Editions or Collector's Editions, but the years went by and they never did - until now! I will absolutely be buying this movie as it's one of my Disney favorites. The song ""God Help the Outcasts"" that Esmerelda sings in the cathedral always give me goosebumps and leaves a tear in my eye. It's so beautiful, and I think it's a song that most everyone can identify with. The story of the sweet, loving Quasimodo who is shunned and feared for nothing more than his looks is one that has a profound and important message that I wish everyone would heed. I think this is a movie everyone should see and should share with their children, though I don't think it's necessarily appropriate for those under 10 as there is some dark imagery and adult themes. I truly believe that the only reason that this movie wasn't an instant classic on the lines of The Lion King is because Disney had the intelligence to give it a PG rating, and for some reason the public couldn't deal with that. While it doesn't have the appeal to the very young that many of the Disney animated movies do, it's not one to miss. The characters are wonderful, ranging from the extremely evil Frollo to the beautiful Esmerelda, the dashing and brave Phoebus, the incredibly sweet and lovable Quasimodo, and the trio of goofy gargoyles who add the very important comic relief. I think there is something for everyone in this movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, be sure to give it a try. I really believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1358035200,13,1970,4.5210084033613445
5462721,5,B00AO686E2,"This movie is by far my favorite Disney movie, even more so then the real life epics like Pirates. The story by Victor Hugo is timeless and Disney hit a home run with their depiction of the story. They especially capture the psyche of every character. Tom Hulce is excellent as Quasimodo with a beautiful light singing voice.  Demi Moore does a beautiful job playing the loving Esmeralda with an emotional singing voice.  Kevin Kline as Phoebus (spelling?)is witty, funny and composed at all times and not much singing at all from him,  The dark horse is Tony Jay as the conflicted Frollo who is, in my opinion, the best Disney villain ever, with his dark ominous presence and powerful baritone singing voice. The music is the highlight of the whole movie that incorporates Gregorian Chants, beautiful opera Aria's,and amazing singers. That is what I think I will miss most in the decision from Disney to no longer produce animated movies. I would take caution though with letting young children watch this movie, only because there are a lot of mature adult themes in this movie and some scary sequences both of which are incorporated in the conflicted Frollo's villain song. Young children would probably not understand this sequence and probably should not be present during his song, but I will leave that to individual discretion. Overall, it's a phenomenal movie and highly recommend it for the whole family. I am 27 and I still love it, my parents are in their 60's and they still love it. Buy this movie before it goes back into the vault! You will not regret it.",1357171200,5,1571,4.747252747252747
5462722,5,B00AO686E2,"Sure it may seem a little weird to write a ""review"" for a product that is not even out yet but, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. The story, the scenery, the music and the brooding serious atmosphere this movie brings us crossed many lines in its original release. From Quasimodo's imprisonment, to attempted murder, and hello... Hellfire anyone? This movie serves as, for me, the pinnacle of Disney movies and I have this wonderful film on DVD at home. But I always wondered, ""Man, when will this come out on Blu-ray?"" The transfers Disney made with recent releases such as Beauty and the Beast and Lion King show that even an old movie can be made to look like new and sound more incredible than ever before. The animation of this movie looks great on DVD and I can't even imagine how much my mind will be blown when The Hunchback of Notre Dame hits the Blu-ray scene.",1356912000,10,922,4.461538461538462
5462723,5,B00AO686E2,"Finally being released on Blu-Ray! I can't wait, I will most definitely purchase it, It's my favorite, next to The Lion King.",1356825600,7,125,4.7272727272727275

5462725,5,B00AO686E2,"While I'll admit that I haven't seen the blu-ray edition and the box art looks amateurish, I am legitimately excited to see this film FINALLY get a proper HD release.

Fans of the Victor Hugo novel may not appreciate this adaptation, but speaking as someone who never read it, this is pretty dang good. While it has all of the Disney staples including beautiful animation, great characters and stellar music (seriously, this might be the best Disney soundtrack out there. Check out ""The Bells of Notre Dame"" on Youtube if you need proof), this movie is surprisingly very deep. And I don't mean ""deep"" in a traditional Disney sense, I mean deep as in I think this is one of the better examples in movie history on the conflicts of love, religion, and lust and how they intertwine. And yes, I'm being serious. It never crosses the line to the point that little kids shouldn't watch it, but adults aren't going to be bored watching it. This isn't a movie that you'll just put on to keep your kids out of your hair for 80 minutes, you'll want to watch it with them. It's actually a FAMILY movie.

Of course this movie does have some flaws, mainly the gargoyles. They are a tad annoying, but they were never a deal breaker for me. Also, most of the CGI animation they used looks dated by today's standard, but I'm sure that's just something I've noticed after watching it so many times.

Overall, this is actually my favorite Disney film and one of my favorite animated movies of all-time. I'll be trading in my DVD soon to get the blu-ray the day it comes out.",1356220800,13,1556,4.491166077738516

Not true. People love this film, and for good reason.

5462782,5,B00AO686E2,"I can't express how much I love this movie! This is definitely one of Disney's greatest masterpieces. There's no doubt in my mind that The Hunchback of  Notre Dame is the epitome of the Disney Renaissance period. The movie is very Gothic and dramatic from the story to the music to the themes and messages expressed by the characters. Other than animation, Disney movies have always been known for their music and the soundtrack for this one is truly a perfection of epic musicality and uniqueness. No other movie has been able to match the grandeur set by this film and it's only made better by the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray enhances the quality of the sound of the music and the clarity and visual details of the colors of the characters and backgrounds. The main female lead Esmeralda is one of the most exemplary Disney characters ever created due to her attitudes and beliefs towards justice, equality, mercy, love, compassion, empathy and charity. Quasimodo is one of the kindest and most tragically misunderstood characters not only due to his physical deformity but also because of his label and role that society has forced upon him. Frollo is by far the darkest and most evil villain ever created by Disney because he doesn't use or rely on magical powers to destroy the lives of all who cross his path and can easily exist in our world. The Blu-ray also comes with the sequel to the Hunchback. While the story may take place in the past, its messages and themes transcends over time and can especially be applied to today's world. Overall, I can't express how strongly I recommend people to buy and watch this movie!! It is an absolute must own for all Disney fans and for all people who enjoy watching movies.",1452729600,,1716,4.682119205298013

5462789,5,B00AO686E2,"I bought the bluray combo pack at Target for $15. It's cheaper. At first it was a series of VHS tapes. Then it's a series of individual DVDs. Now it's a bluray 2 movie collection. Many people are so disappointed that there wasn't any artwork on the DVDs like they used to. When I opened the case, I was like ""uh oh."" Then I checked and both DVDs are stacked into one side. I'm pleased that hunchback films are not one of those Disney classics where it gets released and then about 1-3 years later, it goes back in the vault. I used to play the God Help the Outcasts track along with the movie to sing along with Esmeralda. I don't do that anymore. Hunchback 2 was where I admired Jennifer Love Hewitt from. (I'm surprised she became a mother.) I'm still stumped that in the trailer of the sequel, the narrator mentioned the sequel as Haley Joel Osment's film debut. He's been in a lot before that and I don't watch Sixth Sense. It's still a clever thing for Disney to do so that people don't have to buy individual ones like the rest of the world. I can't wait to see Kevin Kline in the Beauty and the Beast live action remake. It's like a Disney homecoming for him. He's still old enough to be my grandpa. (He looked gaunt in the Charity Day event on the 10th of September. But he'll always be handsome.)

5462795,5,B00AO686E2,"Now this is my first review

I used to own The Hunchback of Notre Dame on VHS but that has long passed and I no longer own a VHS player which is why I bought it on Blu-Ray to relive it again. Now back when I was a little girl I never knew the true dark undertone of the actual movie till I got older, when I watched when I was bit older it finally clicked at out how dark it is for a Disney animated movie. It's dark nature truly shines during the musical number ""Hellfire"" where Frollo sings about his lust for Esmeralda but that song and many others is what makes this a memorable movie I personally think this movie should have at least gotten a PG rating but I digress. It's still a masterpiece of a film with breathtaking animation, utterly amazing songs, the memorable characters such as Quasimodo the sweet but shy bellringer, his gargoyle friends who are pretty much the comic relief in this dark film, Esmeralda the brave and strong gypsy girl who becomes Quasimodo's dearest and truest friend, Phoebes (not sure how to spell his name) Captain of the Guard Esmeralda's love interest, him and Quasi butt heads at first but by the end they become good friends and Frollo the main antagonist of the film he is the Judge and hates Gypsies with a passion, he blames Esmeralda for him lusting for her and goes on a genocidal rampage to find her, he is truly evil. Anyways those are the main characters, do I recommend this movie? Yes I highly do, it is for more older children as said it is dark for an Disney film but if you do  have a toddler and let them watch they probably won't understand the dark nature but it does have some frighting images that need to be aware of but overall it's a wonderful movie that is kinda overlooked cause of it's dark nature I still recommend this Disney animated classic.

Onto the 2nd film
The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2

Eh... it's not as great as it's predecessor, I never owned the 2nd film till I bought this Blu-Ray 2 pack collection but I have seen it before and well it's a skippable sequel. The basic plot of this movie is Quasimodo meets girl named Madeline and well they fall in love, it's set a few years after the first film, Phoebes and Esmeralda have a son, a circus comes to town that is owned by Sarouche the main antagonist of the film, he wants to steal Lafidel (Or however it's pronounced) a famous bell that is engraved in jewels on the inside, Sarouch asks Madeline to hang out with Quasi so that he can get his hands the bell long story short, Quasi and Madeline fall in love, they get the bell back, etc. Now this sequel it's not good, main problem I have with it is that the animation is horrendous I believe it was done by a Disney studio in Japan it's certainly not as smooth as the first film. Anyways the music is also kinda forgettable with the exception of one and that song is in the end credits called ""I'm Gonna Love You"" sung by Madeline's voice actress Jennifer Love Hewitt speaking of most of the voices actors and actresses reprise their role from the first film. Anyways the characters are the same except no Frollo and they added Madeline, Zephyr (Phoebes and Esmeralda's son)  and Sarouche, not much to say on the characters kinda bland and Sarouche is a much weaker villain than Frollo, not as threatening. Do I recommend the sequel? No not really, it is more lighthearted than the first film but that doesn't make it good. Anyways overall the Blu-Ray adaption is wonderful the picture is crystal clear, the sound is great, if you do get The Hunchback of Notre Dame get it on Blu-Ray. Hope this review helped in any way",1434672000,,3600,4.375186846038864

Hunchback I ... The movie is just as I remembered it (but better quality) from back when I owned a VCR. I have always had a pet peeve with this film in that at the end Quasimodo (the homely guy) steps aside to let the handsome Phoebus have Esmeralda. I think it sends an inappropriate message that physical beauty is all-important, and that people who are less perfect don't deserve someone more physically perfect than they are ... Having said that, I really do like this film.

Hunchback II ... I didn't know that they had released this ... I am just as happy that I didn't ... The animation and sound quality were, at best, sub-par. It is only an hour long, not feature-length. Almost like a TV special.",1398556800,,845,4.3081761006289305

5462833,5,B00AO686E2,"THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME:  in my opinion, is pure Disney magic. If you ask me, Frollo (voice of Tony Jay) was truly diabolical. On the other hand, Quasimodo (voice of Tom Hulce) and Esmeralda (voice of Demi Moore) were truly meant to be friends. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""Someday,"" by All-4-One. ""Out There"" was good, too. In my opinion, Tom Hulce can really sing. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Hugo's (voice of Jason Alexander) and Quasimodo's singing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it.

THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME 2: Quasimodo, Hugo, Victor, Phoebus, Laverne and Esmeralda are back after a 6 year absentee. Esmeralda has married Phoebus and are raising a young son. Quasimodo still lives in the bell tower, and an upcoming even is about to happen and doesn't have a name of a girl to shout her name that he loves. That is until a circus comes to town, and a evil circus ring master (Michael McKean) wants one of the bells in Quasimodo's bell tower. And he sends a young woman named Madellaine (Jennifer Love Hewitt) to get information on the bell. Where she meets Quasimodo (Tom Hulce), Esmeralda (Demi Moore) has married Phoebus (Kevin Kline) and has a young son named Zephyr (Haley Joel Osment). Come on do yourself a favor and if you have never seen the first movie or if you had watch this great movie! 5/5",1397088000,3,1492,4.584269662921348

This is an all out musical unlike Pocahontas the film the preceded this one which seemed to have only a few songs in the first half. The new Blu Ray for The Hunchback looks and sounds fabulous! I'm amazed at how flawless this film looks. Most of the bonuses are carried over and nothing important wasn't, so I'm going to say this is the definitive edition of this film. It would have been nice to see some new extra material, but since the film looks this great and even includes the sequel (which I have never watched) I can't really find much to complain about here.

5462843,5,B00AO686E2,"I'll admit, Hunchback was never my favorite Disney movie when it comes to story. I've tried to get behind it but it never seemed to find out what it wanted to be, straddling the line of kid humor and adult themes (I say they should have done darker). However I always loved the art work and craft that went into this movie which really stands out in the Blu Ray version. The colors really pop and I find myself looking more and more at the backgrounds than the characters themselves.

If you're a fan of animation (and just don't see movies like this as fodder to keep your kids busy) then pick this up in Blu Ray. If anything pick this up just to study the different look and animation style of characters like Frollo and Esmeralda, not something you'll find in a traditional Disney movie. Speaking of that, pick it up just for the Hellfire sequence alone, looks amazing in Blu Ray.

I'm also a Disney animation purist and refuse to watch anything with the number ""2"" after the title, so can't comment on the second movie, but I'm sure someone out there will like it.",1375056000,,1068,4.416243654822335

This is one of the most memorable to me for several reasons: The entertaining songs, the well crafted story and lovable characters. Though I think what makes so incredible to me is the gorgeous animation. Truly, there are some of the most breath-taking pieces of art in this with the nice blend of traditional animation and CGI effects.
Moving on, watching this film for the first time in a few years I was absolutely stunned at what an incredible job that Disney digitally restoring the film. IMO, you couldn't even tell that this movie is 17 years old. The colors were so viberant, and the animation so sharp you would have thought that it was shot yesterday. The Audio was very well done as well I thought.

5462858,5,B00AO686E2,"Sadly, the timing of Hunchback was all wrong. When Disney's classic, Beauty and the Beast, was released, the love of Disney's animated features hit an all time high. Complicated with Hunchback following on the heels of 1995's disappointing Pocahontas, the result is one of the most underrated, unjustly passed-over films in a long time -- because, frankly, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is among the best work Disney has done in the last fifty years. It is foolhardy to compare Hunchback with the early classics, like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, or Bambi, and I will not attempt to do so. But Disney's recent films -- classics nearly every one, don't get me wrong -- have all been outdone.

Hunchback's one valid accusation is that it is not particularly faithful to its source material. It's a strong argument, which I nimbly parry by pointing out that many of Shakespeare's works were frightfully inaccurate with regard to actual history let alone a prior fictional work, yet few would quibble with the greatness of those. Similarly, Disney has taken a masterpiece of literature and used it to inspire a masterpiece of animation, and no matter how different they are, they are still both classics in their own right -- just don't go in to Disney's Hunchback expecting an undistorted incarnation of your favorite novel. Without beating around the bush any longer, what makes Disney's film so magnificent?

For starters, it's got an extremely solid story, arguably surpassing even that of Beauty and the Beast, which had admirably solid plot, but which was nevertheless (nitpick alert) marred by Beauty being the story's pawn rather than its maker. Quasimodo, the hunchback, is never carried by the plot, but is active in its creation, as are his co-stars. The characters make the story, and there is not a single second of screen time where they are not in character, believable in their actions, or sound in their logic. Quasimodo is torn between a desire to see and participate in the world and the cruel, restrictive upbringing of Frollo, a local judiciary, which has made him insecure to the point of self-abasement. Indeed, one of Hunchback's most horrific moments come not from some fearsome monster of evil, but when Frollo sings of how much a monster Quasimodo is, and Quasimodo, so much under Frollo's influence and direction, starts to sing along.

Frollo, incidentally, is no ordinary Disney villain. He's as well rounded a character as they come, not just a selfish evil guardian for Quasimodo, but a ravaged soul, acting on his prejudice and hatred for the local gypsies but struggling with his desire to possess one, by the name of Esmeralda. He's also devilishly clever and manipulative, an unnervingly powerful combination. Esmeralda enters the story when Quasimodo first ventures out in to the world, becoming his first real friend. The fourth character, pleasantly voiced by Kevin Kline, is the soldier Phoebus, the final corner to the love square.

Which brings us to the gargoyles, often lampooned as the product of Disney studios adding needlessly cute, loony co-stars for the sake of the kids in the audience. Not so. The gargoyles, we discover, are active when only Quasimodo is around; when others enter the scene, they become rigid and lifeless. I won't presume to give a definitive statement on their real existence any more than I'd do so for Hobbes, from Bill Watterson's famous comic strip. But I will say that it is easier to believe an individual isolated from the world but permitted to observe it would have a company of imaginary friends than to believe he wouldn't (the scene where Quasimodo introduces Esmeralda to the bells is touching). The gargoyles just may represent those sides of Quasimodo's personality he is scared to bring out through himself.

The story is a complex one, involving a complicated array of relationships, emotions, and internal struggles, and it is all done with style, insight, and inspiration. The animation in Hunchback takes the art to new heights...literally. The exhilaration one feels watching Quasimodo romp about the top of the cathedral are breathtaking and will make many -- especially those afraid of heights -- a little giddy. The crowd scenes are also noteworthy pieces of animation, for each person in the crowd is an individual, distinguishable from the masses. Alan Menken's gothic music, while a modern Broadway-style score, recalls the operatic themes of the era and is alternately tender and haunting as the story dictates. It is not his most memorable score, but it's one of his best.

All things considered, there is no legitimate reason why The Hunchback of Notre Dame should not be universally accepted as not only a classic but a masterpiece. It's almost there now, and I predict, with a little time, it one day will. Should you take your kids to see this film? Honestly, it isn't really aimed at the younger generation. Think twice before taking young kids, for there are several horrifying scenes that may frighten them. Other kids will be fine, but they aren't going to pick up on all the intricacies of the story -- the ideal audience for Hunchback is a more mature one than for most other Disney animated features.",1367020800,6,5221,4.974799541809851

wait where did the movie falter?
oh yea, the gargoyles.
they are so low brow and clash with the movie so poorly it's hard to watch. Atleast the Lion King kept a good deference with their drama and humor.
After Paris is burning, which is like Holocaust and 9/11 imaigary. one of the gargoyles starts using the fire to cook a hot dog, directly  referenceing the horror going on. It's like if Pumba made a fart joke as Simba was crying by Mufasa's dead body.
plus the side charactors, particularly Pheabus, are annoying. Pheabus is dim witted, but has a good heart and a smooth voice. Sounds like something from a cheap 90's sitcom than early renaissance.
Esmerelda also has her moments but she's cool, since she keeps her role as the siren.
I have a huge disrespect for this movie because this movie could have been amazing, but Disney was just enslaved with it's formula of low brow comedic side charactors. They took a risk, but it's not fully realized.

  Lyrics by Stephen Schwartz

Making an animated film as ambitious as The Hunchback of Notre Dame was a bold move when you consider that the film leaves less opportunity for Disney to enrich its other divisions than say, another princess movie. Hunchback might have made a great Broadway show (and still would, as it was very successful on stage in Germany), but it's more adult than perhaps any Disney feature since Fantasia and less conducive to plush toys (though there were a few). But Disney Animation was riding so high at the time, there seemed to be no limit to how high they could reach, and are to be admired for pushing the boundaries given the chance.

And push it does. Hunchback has some highly electrifying scenes, especially for a mass-market animated film. The human animation is downright astonishing, especially considering that, according to the commentary, while there was some modeling done, this is not that watery rotoscope stuff.

Frollo is the most purely evil of all Disney human villains, with no redeemable features and a creepy depravity that is brought to a boiling intensity in the set piece, ""Hellfire."" Animator Kathy Zielinski, again according to the commentary, dressed as the villain to get the details of the outfit right. I suspect that there was also a strong influence from the animation of Maleficent and Lady Tremaine as well. You could almost imagine Eleanor Audley's voice coming out of Frollo!

This score is perhaps the pinnacle in Alan Menken's already spectacular music career. Few songs reach into your heart and soul like ""God Help the Outcasts,"" sung to perfection by Heidi Mollenhauer as the singing voice of Esmeralda (Demi Moore delivers a superb speaking performance as well.)

This is a film, which, like the novel, explores heady material about life, death, religion and politics, thus perhaps too pithy for everyone who saw it back then. Hunchback wasn't the hit that Lion King was, though it would have been somewhat unrealistic to expect so much. I do think that of all Disney features produced during this period, Hunchback may be much more revered in the future than it ever was in its own time.

How do you follow the eye-filling spectacle and tireless detail of the original Disney Hunchback, perhaps the most elaborate feature since Pinocchio? First, you make the script strong to overcome the time and budget restrictions on a made-for-video sequel. You also get a skillful director, in this case Bradley Raymond, who has done miracles since with his second Tinker Bell movie and Return to Never Land.

Retaining the original voice cast, albeit relegating Esmeralda and Phoebus to cameos, what would seem to be unthinkable actually works. It takes on the task of following up on a Disney epic as well a Hugo classic. Instead of taking a somber, pompous approach, this film tells a more intimate story in a remarkably convincing way. You start out thinking, ""Oh come on! Quasimodo gets a girlfriend? Please!"" but Jennifer Love-Hewitt's character is just enough of a non-conformist to make it plausible.

The songs are pleasant but not as memorable as the ones in the original. That was one tall order that was just too insurmountable. And even though the sequel repeats some of the same elements as the first film, particularly having yet another festival, the result is very entertaining.

5462870,3,B00AO686E2,"I remember back when Pocahontas was released I was not looking forward to it but when I saw it I thought it was great.

So, the year after when the original film was released I was hoping for the same. I was disappointed.

The film is just OK.  Nothing special.  When the film starts you think you are looking at Beauty and the Beast.  No.  The music is a disappointment.  No characters you remember after the fact.  Although they did you some names for characters voice, Jason Alexander at the height of Seinfeld fame, Moore, Oscar winner Kevin Kline.  No memorable scenes.  You do not remember the film after you just saw it.

I remember at Disneyland that summer they had a show for the film.  Never saw it.

Animation is fine but not usual at this point Disney standards.  To me it looks like Saturday morning animation.

They have a making of extra.  For this one & Brother Bear released at the same day as the Mulan blu ray.  Mulan, a bigger hit, did NOT get one.

A sequel.  NOT needed for this film at all.

And, Disney now going cheap on blu ray releases.  NO art work on the discs.

The original film is just fine, nothing more to say about it.  The sequel unnecessary & a cheap blu ray package.",1364083200,4,1205,4.304932735426009
5462871,4,B00AO686E2,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment has gone from releasing one movie every couple of months on Blu-ray to pushing multiple ones out at the same time. One of this month's high-definition treats is ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" 2-Movie Collection. The 3-Disc Special Edition contains the original 1996 film along with its inferior yet entertaining 2002 sequel. Both movies were restored and feature Disney's enhanced high definition picture and sound.

Whenever someone asks what the greatest animated Disney film is, you'll invariably get the same answers from everyone. People will exclaim titles like ""The Lion King,"" ""Sleeping Beauty,"" ""Cinderella,"" or ""Snow White."" You'll never hear anyone campaigning for ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" Well, I mean to change that!

I know ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" doesn't have a chance put up against a bunch of soft-spoken petite princesses, but it should. I would argue that it has more heart and reaches a whole new level of grandeur in visual scale. The gothic setting and massive background art casts a huge shadow over anything else the studio has ever done.

When you're watching ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" the tragedy unfolding in front of you just sucks you in. I imagine it's how audiences feel when they're viewing a Broadway version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" or ""Les Miserables."" You truly feel as if you're taking in an animated epic which could measure up to any Cecil B. DeMille live action production.

While the songs might not be as memorable as ""Under the Sea"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" they're more dramatic than any of those combined. Alan Menken stepped outside of the box and composed operatic numbers for the tale of Quasimodo. To top it off, they're filled with dark lyrical subjects I would imagine young children would be afraid of or just not understand.

Disney included ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" in the Blu-ray edition as well. There's a big difference in the quality of animation and storyline. It's still entertaining and has a villain you quickly grow to dislike. However, it doesn't measure up to the original at all. It's much more child friendly, which is what Disney is known for.

The video and audio quality of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" Blu-ray edition leaves no room for complaints. The picture is clean, colorful, and as flawless as you've come to expect. The 5.1 surround sound immerses the viewer in several complex layers of dialogue, musical numbers, and noises of the bustling city of Paris.

There's some nice bonus material for consumers to enjoy. ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" comes with audio commentary provided by Producer Don Hahn and directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale. There's a 28-minute documentary entitled ""The Making of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame.'"" It also includes a multi-language reel for ""A Guy Like You."" A featurette entitled ""A Gargoyle's Life"" round out the special features. The only extra included for ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame II"" is the featurette ""Behind the Scenes with Jennifer Love Hewitt.""

Of course my preference for ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" comes from a love of period piece gothic horror films like ""Frankenstein,"" ""Dracula,"" and the likes. In reality, I know this sort of animated movie will never win over the beautiful sugary sweet tales featuring Prince Charming saving the helpless Princess from a fire-breathing dragon or wicked witch.

5462875,5,B00AO686E2,"The sweeping music. The beautiful animation. The emotion-charged story. This is The Hunchback of Notre Dame, a Walt Disney Pictures film, a gorgeous experience. Especially on blu-ray.

This film has always been a personal favorite of mine. Its my favorite musical. Its my favorite Disney film. It takes it's place on my Top 10 List. It is a timeless film, one that has aged with grace and style. I remember seeing it in theaters back in the 90s. The opening music alone was enough to fill me with awe. I was 5 or 6 years old. Old enough to enjoy the colorful animation...not old enough to completely grasp everything else.

Fast forward. Now I'm 22. And I see The Hunchback of Notre Dame for what it truly is: a masterpiece. Disney hasn't made a film like it since. Perhaps they never will.

This is the only animated film that brings me to tears. It's messages are timely and universal, a wake-up call to the monsters of humanity and a gentle embrace to the outcasts. No, I am not deformed. Yet I relate to Quasimodo entirely, his fear of being hurt, his desire to experience freedom, his pain from being cooped up and made to live under fear. I'm gay, and I come from a Mormon/LDS family, one who's religion often times shows its ugly side without reprieve. I can relate to the central character because I understand what he's going through. Deformation causes some people to feel uncomfortable or uninitiated in interacting with the deformed person. Same goes for gay people. Many people I know are uncomfortable with my sexuality. This film's message of acceptance towards those who are different is timely.

The villain in this film is the scariest, most realistic villain in any Disney film. He exists. There are people out there who share his hatred for anything different. His actions in this film are terrifying.

Though this film is rated G, it is anything but a mindless, forgettable flick for young children. Quite the opposite, it is Disney's most mature film. Yes, there are added comic figures to help lighten the mood and keep the kiddies amused, but this film is truly for adults, and adults with open minds.

In one scene the hunchback is tied to a spinning platform and publicly humiliated, crying for help from his master (the villain) who turns his face, ignoring the plea. Why? Because he is different.

This scene is heart-wrenching. And transcends its G rating, becoming emotionally draining and easily standing as the symbol for what the film is trying to say.

Moments after, a gypsy woman is compassionate and frees the poor young man, exclaiming ""Justice!"". Her cry for justice is a cry for equality. For compassion. For understanding. For those who deem themselves higher to stop, come down, and show love to those in need. Her passionate desire is also expressed wonderfully through the song ""God help the outcasts"".

For anyone who has seen this film and walked away from it with negative feelings, to you I say: this film wasn't made for you.

This film is for the outcast. The hunchbacks. The gays. The misunderstood. Anyone who feels different. It's message is one of acceptance. It speaks, softly, saying: Don't be afraid to live your life with those you find who love you for who you are.

One of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Film: 5/5 STARS

The picture quality on the blu-ray disk is fantastic. It is a completely different film in 1080p High Definition, with lines crisp and colors vivid. The background art is gorgeous, and the motion of the film is fluid and nearly flawless. The film is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio (it fills the entire screen). Is it perfect? No. But I'll be shocked if there is ever a version released that looks better than this one. Video: 4.5/5 STARS

The stunning musical score pleases with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack. This is my favorite musical for many reasons, one of them of course being the music. The epic, chilling music sounds fantastic on the blu-ray, and the songs burst to life with audible lyrics. I couldn't be more pleased. Sound: 5/5 STARS

Extras include The Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 on the blu-ray disk, a DVD copy of both films (3 disks total), and all the special features from those past DVDs. There aren't any new features here. The Audio Commentary track on the first film is still a highlight. Extras: 2.5/5 STARS

Overall: 5/5 STARS. I don't give the honor of 5 stars to just any film. This one deserves it, with a blu-ray treatment sure to please old fans and new ones too. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is an emotionally epic film and it is thrilling on blu-ray.

Rating: G. This film should have been rated PG for Thematic Material including Brief Thematic Language, and Some Intense Peril. Young children might not understand the adult-oriented story and might be frightened by some of the intense drama. There is some sexual material, but only the adults will pick up on it. The words Hell and Damn/Damnation are used in Religious context (Brief Thematic Language). One character is tied and publicly abused, this might upset some viewers. A character is tied and surrounded by fire as they inhale smoke, this will upset some viewers. One character is shot with an arrow, mild blood. A small family is locked inside their house while the villain sets fire to it, this will upset some viewers. Most of this film takes itself seriously, it really should have been rated PG.

5462878,5,B00AO686E2,"This movie is not for everyone - even if Hollywood could never handle the ""real ending"" of Victor Hugo's book. It is dark, it is adult. But Disney captures the quality of two characters better than any other version I know.  Archdeacon Frollo is exhibited with all the sexual madness of the villain, truly stalking his object of desire, consumed with the fire of lust. As a priest, he is a metaphor for those whose spirituality is false.  And Esmeralda is superb as the dark skinned gypsy girl whose bohemian liveliness and loveliness charm most who cross her path.

I always wanted this movie in Blu-Ray because the landscape scenes of Paris and Notre Dame Cathedral are spectacular as are the intricate church, cathedral stained glass, and bell details themselves.

Still, this is one of the greatest love stories ever told...since Quasimodo's devotion to the gypsy Esmeralda is the stuff of myth.  No student of the tale should miss it.",1362700800,3,939,4.84375

Like many reviews here have said, Hunchback is definitely an acquired taste. It's not for small kids by any means, but then again, couldn't the same be said for Snow White (a scary witch/queen asking for the heart of Snow White to be cut out??).

However, the score and songs are so incredibly beautiful and theatrical. The cinematography and animation (especially of Notre Dame itself) is breathtaking. The subject matter, as rough as it is at times, has been very diluted for children so it's not quite as dark as the original book by Dumas. However, it's among the best and most epic of the second ""golden age"" of Disney animated classics (Mermaid through Tarzan).

5462885,4,B00AO686E2,"Let's face it: in the pantheon of great Disney classics, The Hunchback of Notre Dame isn't going to show up at the top of many lists. It was a commercial failure for Disney and the adult themes and difficult subject matter was quite controversial at its time of release. But why? There is much to like about this film. The animation is lovely, as is the music, but the songs aren't as memorable or accessible as what you'll find in The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast or even Aladdin. And that is what has kept this film out of the hearts and minds of most Disney fans. It's a tough nut to crack and at times a bit bitter to swallow. Because of some of the violence and sexual themes, I don't recommend it for small children; mainly because they just won't understand a lot of what is going on and parents my not be ready to explain why the old man is looking at Esmerelda that way. Don't get me wrong, I loved it when it came out; I listened to the soundtrack CD for months on end. I will happily purchase this on Blu-Ray and enjoy it for what it is: a flawed yet enjoyable Disney film. If you haven't ever seen it, give it a try. But don't expect to hum the tunes in the car on the way to work or have your kids ask you for a Hunchback party for their next birthday. It isn't that kind of Disney movie for most people.
