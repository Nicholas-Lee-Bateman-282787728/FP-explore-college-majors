Better than Twilight? Hell this is better than The Bible. So buy this now! I'm glad I can share this classic from my childhood with my children. For years I thought this wonderful Tatsunoko gem was lost forever, but here it is. Why are you still reading this? WHY HAVENT YOU BOUGHT IT YET?!?",1386806400,5,462,4.578313253012048
5615831,4,B00BG475V6,Subtitles are a couple of seconds off on episode 9 I advise you to watch this raw since it can be very confusing and  thenarrator keeps repeating Yattaros attack in every episode which is very annoying!,1383350400,,202,4.611111111111111
5615832,5,B00BG475V6,Fast shipping and a great show to watch!! Highly recommend watching this cute anime. Great soundtrack as well. Enjoyed greatly!,1382918400,,127,5.4
5615833,4,B00BG475V6,A totally different (but still funny) look at this footage. It takes itself somewhat seriously and provides some background for the world that SPC does not. Samurai Pizza Cats still has a better theme song though.,1378252800,,213,4.944444444444445
5615834,5,B00BG475V6,"The DVD is perfect. The quality and the subtitles are Amazing, just like I expected it! I reccomand this product to every Kyatto Ninden Teyandee fan, because it's the only opportunity to see your favourite series with the original dialogues and translated in the english subtitles!",1373241600,3,281,5.130434782608695
5615835,5,B00BG475V6,The DVD gave fan of the pizza cat to see how much we changed and how much we did not.,1370736000,,85,3.3
5615836,5,B00BG475V6,"Not only will this be great for learning the language but the picture is it's self clean and crisp! After having watched the American series, 'Samurai Pizza Cats' on YouTube for a time, seeing such a clean quality motion-picture as this causes one to love Kyatto Ninden Teyandee / Samurai Pizza Cats even more so!

Look forward to the English version - Samurai Pizza Cats - supposedly this July!",1367971200,2,395,4.72463768115942
5615837,5,B00BG475V6,"...it'll be hard not to like this DVD set. As a warning, this is Japanese audio only with English subtitles. Since the English version has many edits, it is a separate release.

Kyatto Ninden Teyandee is the original show that became the basis for Samurai Pizza Cats. There are some noticeable differences, primarily that KNT isn't quite so gag heavy. It's still entertaining in its own right, but you'll likely get less out of it if you're unfamiliar with Pizza Cats.

The picture quality is pretty good for a show that's 20+ years old. There may be an occasional error in the subtitles, but they are more than sufficient for your viewing needs. There's very little in the way of extras, mainly clean versions of the opening and closing.

Chances are you already know if you want this set or not. It's a nice compilation and just amazing for all the effort that went into making this DVD set available at all.",1367107200,15,910,4.604938271604938

8567909,5,B00BG475V6,"I was THOROUGHLY pleased to receive my new DVD set; I've had the opportunity to watch all episodes; and they all play wonderfully!

It was great to see a childhood favorite of mine in its original making! Thank you!!!",1454716800,,217,4.564102564102564
8567910,5,B00BG475V6,"This is a wonderful collection of a series I loved when aired in America and love even more when I've seen the original. KNT is the original form of Samurai Pizza Cats and is much more of a standard ""weekly monster"" sentai show. It has comedy of course but also is vastly different then what Spc has to offer. This collection has all 54 episodes with english subtitles, that are good but not the greatest translation. This is also a dvd collection of a show from the early 90's and will not exactly be bluray quality animation but it is very pleasing for the eyes nonetheless. All in all it is not 100% perfect and can be pretty expensive but it is a wonderful collection for a series that deserves more recognition then it got.",1435622400,,728,4.4
8567911,5,B00BG475V6,"What can I sya this set is great.
Pros
Good video quality given the age of the show about on par with the dragon ball blue bricks
OPTIONAL subtitles yes you can watch these raw this was a huge selling point for me
all episodes in one boxset soans 8 discs
cons
What cons
I would hughly recomend this to anyone either getting into anime or just curious to see samurai pizza cats as it was originaly produced in japan. Be warned this is an obscure title so this won't stay in print to much longer so buy it now before it goes out of print and it starts selling for ungodly amounts of monety.",1410566400,2,588,4.121739130434783
8567912,4,B00BG475V6,"I'm a fan of the americanized version of this series but I like the japanese version a bit better, so I got this set. After over a decade of being petitioned on the internet, Discotekmedia got the rights and we now have Americanized and Japanese DVD releases. Hooray! Thank you Discotekmedia!

All 54 episodes of the original japanese version are contained on this release, no censorship.

Pros:

- It got released after all these years, and I'm happy
- All episodes uncut

- Looks and sounds like a VHS tape. Could be a good or a bad thing (I'll leave it for you to decide). It adds to the nostalgia factor, that's for sure.

Cons:

- Packaging quality leaves something to be desired. The discs can shift during transport (one of them did, luckily it's ok)
- Seems like the translation is not the best. It could be perhaps that some of the expressions and words used in this series are diffucult to translate to english, a good example would be ""Teyandee"".

Overall, if you love Pizza Cats, get it while you can. As the show wasn't that popular you just don't know for how long it will be available.",1396569600,,1100,4.47
8567913,5,B00BG475V6,"i love this dvd collection, when i heard this was gonna be release i was hype for it. quite an interesting thing they did is that they make the japanese version and the english version seperate (from my understanding the english version was heavily edited plus is missing an episode) im gladd they release this collection in its original state. now i need to purchase the english version to have a comparison of it.

i recommend to everyone",1390953600,2,440,4.641025641025641
8567914,5,B00BG475V6,This DVD collection is just like you if you pleased the anime cartoons of the end of the past century. The Samurai Pizza Cats are the favorites characters of all. Of collection.,1389657600,,177,4.5625
8567915,3,B00BG475V6,"I will not review the Japanese version since this is not what is important here.
Translation of the series could have been better. In a lot of scenes the publishers chose the safe route and did not translate the scene accurately, so as to sound less offensive. Also a lot of text and signs were left untranslated.
 One episode has a subtitle timing error making it unwatchable. Did not receive any replacement DVD like they claimed they would have done.
Also discs with 7 episodes have one re-encoded episode with blended frames, from what I read.
It is not easy releasing an obscure series in its original format and translate it as well, with so many episodes. Price for such an effort is ok. But  I'd prefer if they doubled the price yet also kept the original translation and many extras.",1389657600,4,792,4.609929078014185
