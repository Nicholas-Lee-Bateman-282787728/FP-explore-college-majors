7316247,1,B010RJNP50,"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE MOVIE.... I waited for this a long time to come out ! Kept up with the Facebook page, kept watching for updates, and finally comes out and  WHAT A LET DOWN. This movie is as another customer said GARBAGE. The acting was rancid, which I understand they are nobody actors, but the story/plot ( if you can even call it that was absurd ). this was a mess.",1444694400,5,369,4.271428571428571

7316250,4,B010RJNP50,"Kenny Caperton is the writer of this occult Halloween horror tale, and it is in the same vein as Zombie's ""The Lords Of Salem"". The story blends aspects of chilling atmosphere, macabre theatrics and almost hypnotic surrealism- the dream sequence that seems to tap into some metaphysical state is some of my favorite moments in the film. True arthouse horror moments. But there is so much about ""Honeyspider"" that is so cool, retro and  fresh that I just really enjoyed being pulled into the main character's story. And the occult stuff always gets me giddy in horror, especially films that build it around Halloween/Samhain.

The special effects and makeup are complimentary to this dark, mystical nightmare. The atmosphere builds on some nice sounds that instantly throw you back into classic 80's horror. The cool addition of adding a film within a film gives some extra and much needed blood and gore. All of which is practical effects done masterfully. I personally loved the soundtrack from the first notes of the synth just after the intro right up until the very last moments of the film. The mix of songs from various indie genre artists and the instrumental stuff really put you in the attitude and emotion of the film. Nothing about the effects or the 80's setting felt fabricated or cheap. I guess you could argue that some of the props were more retro inspired than actual 80's, but it all looked and felt 80's to me.

Overall ""Honeyspider"" is a well crafted horror tale with some truly instant classic moments. This is indie/ low-budget film making awesomeness! The cast give stellar performances and the dialog is short but effective. The film does take a slow and steady build up with occult, and suspense thriller mixing together in a methodical pace in away that pulls you into the story, and you just set and watch as it all unfolds. ""Honeyspider"" takes the best of the horror genre-from it's ""new""beginnings in the Corman era, through the occult days, right into the totally awesome slasher/splatter days of the 80's. Definitely check ""Honeyspider"" out. I do think the ending may bother some horror fans but only if the ending to ""The Lords Of Salem"" bothered you! I love it and feel it begs a second installment.",1444521600,,2232,4.822454308093994
7316251,5,B010RJNP50,"""Honeyspider"" is a gem of a film. This 2014 indie flick hails from director/executive producer Josh Hasty and writer/producer Kenny Caperton. Set on Halloween, it follows Jackie Blue (Mariah Brown) on her birthday, Halloween 1989, as the day gets progressively more strange. Jackie is plagued by weird dreams, a creepy professor (Frank J. Aard), and familial problems. What makes ""Honeyspider"" so terrific is the way it embodies late 70's and early 80's horror flicks like ""Halloween,"" ""Nightmare On Elm Street,"" and ""Child's Play."" The film simultaneously mocks and celebrates the inherent cheesiness of the slasher genre, playing cleverly upon tropes.

There's a lovely mix of horror and comedy. One of the most enjoyable aspects is ""Sleepover Slaughterhouse III,"" a film-within-a-film. While fictional, it definitely seems like it could have derived from the school of camp so prevalent in the golden age of slasher flicks. Acting is top-notch, with inspired performances, the soundtrack time warps viewers back to the 80's, and the backdrop is fantastic. Shooting locations include The Gem Theatre in Kannapolis, NC and the Myers House NC. Overall, a fun, original indie horror romp, ""Honeyspider"" is destined to be a Halloween favorite.

7316252,1,B010RJNP50,"One of the absolute worst pieces of garbage I have seen this year, this movie had no redeemable qualities and should be relegated to the annals of film obscurity. The acting was beyond bad (especially by the lead actress; please never act again), the premise made very little sense, and nothing (and I mean, nothing) of interest goes on for much of the film. The special effects are a joke, the soundtrack is amateurish at best, and it is just a complete and utter waste of time. There are movies that you watch and aren't very good and make you say, ""At least they tried"", while others (like this one) make you pray to God that the people involved in this travesty NEVER make a film again. I wish I had never wasted my precious time on this tripe. One of the worst films I have seen in my life. Avoid like it is contagious.",1444262400,10,824,4.32258064516129
