seeing some upcoming actors like Redford at early point in career.
The half-hour series had some oomph. Short, sveet - and bye. The full
hour series is example of Universal and Hitchcock cranking out junk
for loot. By the early '60s all Hitchcock wanted was more & more money.
Whhyyy? Anyway, the less said about his Hour tvers - and the less seen -
the better for Alfie Cockie.",1302998400,,447,4.530864197530864
8311751,1,B001J2QF84,"I strongly feel that Universal is really doing a disservice to those of us in the U.S. by not making the Alfred Hitchcock Hour available here. There are a lot of Hitchcock fans wanting to buy this series but because it's not legally available here, others are making huge profits by selling bootleg dvds of the shows copied from both TV and elsewhere.

I also think the very slow releasing of AH Presents (the 1/2 hour series) is taking way too long between seasons. Universal is definately NOT remastering them so why the wait ?!?

For all the money Hitchcock made for Universal, you'd think the company would share the master's other works with his fans.",1275782400,15,656,4.646551724137931
8311752,4,B001J2QF84,"My reservations about this set - which keeps me from giving 5 stars - are the random order of the episodes as well as no neat extras.

Picture and sound are excellent, being from the Universal vault. Just be sure to use the audio set up options and choose English.

NOW, as to others whining about this set not being available for US players, do yourselves a favor and get a region-free player (several sold by Amazon). They are not expensive, play all DVDs, and will open a whole new world of DVD watching by letting you get DVDs from all over the world. The British Amazon (amazon.co.uk) is an excellent source.",1275609600,15,613,4.464285714285714
