7545156,5,B018ELUDEY,"I love this film!  It's edgy, mysterious and dark, very engaging and totally unique.  I found myself utterly enveloped in their world.  Not to mention, the acting is fantastic, it's stunning visually and it's got a killer soundtrack.  The absolute best in indie film, can't recommend it enough.  MUST SEE!",1453680000,6,305,5.02
7545157,5,B018ELUDEY,"I saw this film in Portland, OR where it was filmed. I was amazed at the way the director and cinematographer accurately captured certain areas of the city.  I found myself caring about the characters in the film. So much so, that I would love a sequel.",1452902400,5,253,4.382978723404255

8742109,1,B018ELUDEY,"One of the characters is this young waif who creates awesome ambient music.  Her understated acting style meshes well with the slow pace and what looks like a vintage film luster.  She befriends a neighbor, Thor, who appears a kindred spirit.  The rest is rather uninteresting and poorly acted.  As the plot unravels you care less and less about the characters - tragic past included.",1466812800,2,384,4.861538461538461
8742110,1,B018ELUDEY,Birds Of Neptune with  Molly Elizabeth Parker  - We were so disinterested that we didn't watch very much of the movie and turned it off. That doesn't happen very often even when it's a slow moving story. Sorry. This was a dud.,1464652800,,226,4.357142857142857
8742111,2,B018ELUDEY,"Very poor plot line regarding three sisters who lost their parents. One is a stripper and invites a man into her home and he sleeps with another sister.  Some of the acting is decent, so I gave it two stars.",1460764800,,207,4.175

8742113,1,B018ELUDEY,"I can't believe that all 5 reviews have 5 stars! The movie is definitely not for an average viewer. A sane person can not enjoy this nonsense - PERIOD. Me and my husband tried really hard to find it enjoyable, but we finally gave up and turned it off...",1459209600,,253,4.183673469387755
8742114,5,B018ELUDEY,"Yes, I loved this movie.  I was lucky to see it as a premier in Portland, OR and wanted to go again, so I did!  I'm a art-house movie snob and this was quintessentially an art-house-movie-snob film.  Thank you Molly and Britt.  I love you and will stalk you forevermore.",1454457600,5,270,4.34
