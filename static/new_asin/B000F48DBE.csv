2551024,4,B000F48DBE,"I really had fun watching this film. It is a horror-comedy of a higher standard. The movie varies from hilarious to grotesque. The comedy in this movie is derived from the killer being way over the top. Most you see coming, but some catches you off guard. The plot is very rarely on track, and this movie is VERY confusing. However, it gets 4 stars, because the death scenes in this are BRILLIANT on the budget the movie had.

Cheeky comedy, mixed with horrific violence.

Overall, a good buy.",1149033600,3,493,4.52808988764045
2551025,4,B000F48DBE,"Basic Plot: A mysterious English man (Christopher Lee) loses his mansion-home in a poker game, passing on not only ownership to the young, naive winner (Benny Young), but something much worse along with it -- a homicidal demon-jester known as the Funny Man (Tim James) who infests the house!

The Funny Man turned out to be pretty much what I expected: A strange, low-budget British horror flick with lots of dark, silly comedy. I can't say it was a masterpiece, or even slightly thought-provoking, but it's definitely a fun way to pass an hour and a half. The humor is pretty over-the-top (which I happen to like), and the story is decently interesting and original. But for the most part, the only reason you should see this is for the scenes with Tim James as the whacky evil jester. It's his witty one-liners and eccentric antics that keep the pace flowing. And that's really all it is -- some guy in a surprisingly impressive suit killing off characters in comedic ways. If you're a fan of B movies, this is certainly not as low as you can go in quality. As a matter of fact, it's above most others of its kind. So go on. Have a nice, sinister laugh with the Funny Man!",1148774400,3,1174,4.485981308411215

8117187,5,B000F48DBE,"This movie is pure entertainment! A cult classic for sure. Who cares that its a low budget movie with only one person that is known and only has a small part. Its what they created with what they had. Tim James owns that roll and rocks the funnyman costume. The movie is fast paced,the kills were unique and funny as hell. You have to understand English slang and the accent. Watch it enough times and you will figure it out eventually. Someone sent me this movie on a boot vhs years ago and I was hooked ever since. The dvd extras and menus are superb. Recommended to cult/low budget fans with a wacked out/yet witty sense of humor with some gore in the mix.",1398902400,,659,4.32258064516129
8117188,4,B000F48DBE,"Well, Funny Man was very bizarre and surely a cult classic.  I watched it and enjoyed the film.  I planned on giving it to my son, who is 30 and collects flicks of this nature.  It was all I'd hoped it would be!",1382227200,,211,3.86046511627907
8117189,2,B000F48DBE,"Funny Man is a sick and twisted take on the concept of ""Punch"" (as in Punch and Judy) Freddy Kruger, Leprechaun, and perhaps was also an influence on the ""Saw"" series.

The film starts off really well, luring the viewer into a  very English, and Surreal opening scene, with the great Christopher Lee, however after this it all goes down-hill. As I mentioned before, Christopher Lee is always great, and Tim James is really ""unique"" as the Funny Man, however my main problem with this film is really ""why"" was any of this happening at all, there's no overriding sense of purpose,  and only a vague attempt at a ""morality play"".

I do like some of the grotesque slayings, and bizarre one liners of the ""Funny Man"" and I found the character of ""Zelma"" funny, as she looks like the girl from the original ""Scooby-Doo"" cartoon, and is cute. Overall it's a good concept, starts well, loses steam and finally just peters out, it is actually a very sick little film, with some good, surreal and possibly chemically enhanced scenes. Simon Sprackling is certainly onto something here, but what, and more importantly, why?",1316908800,,1111,4.740932642487047
8117190,5,B000F48DBE,"""funny man""  is every bit the classic that it has long been promoted as, and is very affordably priced at $18.96.  what more can anyone ask?",1288051200,,140,4.346153846153846
8117191,4,B000F48DBE,"He jokes like Freddy.
He kills like Freddy.
But unlike Freddy he does it with an English accent..... while dressed as a jester.
If you liked flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street, Leprechaun, Child's Play, & Wishmaster
because of their elaborate, creative, comical kills,
and their wisecracking, supernatural villains, than you'll be right at home in Merry Old England with this violently amusing horror comedy.
The deaths are all top notch horror entertainment, every one is unique, and worth the price tag alone
though oftentimes they seem almost looney-toon-ish in nature.
Expect some english humor similar to Monty Python, and expect a lot of it to be directed to the audience itself.
Like the jester is aware you're watching him, and is putting on this show just for you.

Instead of giving away surprises like the description on this page, and the one on the back of the box insist on doing;
Here's a synopsis of the plot without any possible spoilers.
Record exec Max Taylor wins an ancestral mansion in a card game from Christopher Lee!!
So right away that should tell you something is wrong with the house.
Soon after moving his wife & kids in
(and I mean right after, this movie doesn't waste any time)
the bodies start piling up.
An evil jester lives below the house in the village of Sod's Law (Population 1)
An evil jester whose excessively creative arsenal is a homicidal vision of Tom & Jerry proportions.
And he's out for a good time.
Killing anyone & everyone for no good reason at all.
Just the fun of it.
And just like any good jester he knows how to put on a show for his audience.
And as luck would have it even more fun is on the way,
in the form of Max Taylor's brother,
his band (one member of which is Velma from Scooby Doo for whatever reason),
and a Jamaican fortune teller they picked up hitchhiking who sees the danger ahead, and prepares by injecting her hand with god only knows what,
which has an effect on it that only be described as ""say what?!"".

All in all it's an enjoyable film,
a welcome addition to any horredy library,
especially if you dig british humor, and over the top death scenes.
Worth a purchase, or at the very least a rental.

By all means i say give this A RENT and if you like buy it.",1151625600,,221,3.25
8117193,4,B000F48DBE,"Simon Sprackling's ""FUNNY MAN"" is a horror/comedy like no other! If you took the movie ""Leprechaun"" mashed it together with the comedy style of ""The Kids In The Hall"" add a few buckets of chunky red stuff & then took some lysergic acid diethylamide the outcome would be something like this demented nightmare. This underrated freakshow defines the words cult classic & is a must have for anyone who enjoys the hell out of goofy horror films.",1151020800,,441,4.740259740259741
