A real life court trial is not as dramatic as in fiction. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows were simplified and modified versions from the originals or new stories. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. The many character actors enrich these stories, their emotions are often read from their facial expressions.
