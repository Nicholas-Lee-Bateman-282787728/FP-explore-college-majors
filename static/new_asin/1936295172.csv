7801997,1,1936295172,"I watched the first four chapters all the way through and just couldn't endure much more.  I skipped around through the last few chapters just to make sure that I didn't miss any good information.  I have to say, I didn't see any indication of higher consciousness in this film or in the couple!  The majority of the film is all about the physical energy aspects of sex and justification of lustful behavior that will only succeed in keeping one stuck in lower ego based consciousness (like porn, prostitution and swinging).  They also made a remark about how porn actually helps reduce the amount of rapes and pedofile assualts every year!  That was just crazy!

That being said, I believe sexual arousal or enjoyment (even hot, mind blowing enjoyment)can be a very loving and beautiful experience, but this was not the way it was presented in the film.  They kept talking about using sex to ""shift your energy"", but they never really got into where you were supposed to be shifting it or exacly how you were supposed to do that. According to them, just the act of lusty sex will clear out old energy & land you into higher consciousness!

Not ONCE did I hear anything about the Sacred Union between the Divine Feminine and Divine Masculine to create a transfer of Heart energy, unconditional Love energy.  Bringing the two energies together to create an incredible exchange of Light and Love in order to reach higher dimensional states of consciousness by opening all the chakras (including the 8th and above).  They barely even mentioned the chakras!

I also have to question the entities that the wife claims to be channeling.  I didn't get the impression that these were enlightened beings.  If they are, then their human filters are getting in the way.  I just didn't resonate with the information at all.

I was really looking forward to learning techniques on how to use the Twin Fold Flame energy of Sacred Love to raise my Kundalini  and increase my vibrational frequency to help me reach higher states of consciousness. This film was not about Sacred Love, just sex.  I was very disappointed.",1343952000,,2103,4.765193370165746
