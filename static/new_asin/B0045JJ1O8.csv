4262913,1,B0045JJ1O8,"Why do the producers feel compelled to cloak their evangelism as an objective documentary?

Because take away the excellent History Channel production values and narration you're left with  Jim Bakker pointing to a map prophesying something bad will happen in the Middle East.

The closing credits cite the documentary's sources including Wikipedia.org, FoxNews.com and CNN.com.",1315094400,25,378,5.836363636363636
4262914,5,B0045JJ1O8,"This documentary is truly one that everyone should watch. Even once and a while there is information that is so valuable that the entire world should be aware of it. This is one of those movies.  It is a documentary covering thousands of years of prophecies, those that have come to pass, and those that have yet to occur.  It is not a Hollywood Nostradamus, Edger Cayce or Mayan prophecies that are encryptic, unverifiable and created for entertainment.  It is based on a series of hundreds of prophecies spanning thousands of years that have been 100% verified and have already occurred with special emphasis on those prophecies left unfulfilled. As the movie shows, the framework of those yet to be fulfilled is unfolding right before our eyes. We can see this framework unfolding on the evening news of world events happening.  The world suddenly makes sense now!  The problems in the world and what is happening now, and what is about to happen is clearly shown.  On one hand it's scary but it also provides a sense of peace knowing what has and will happen and that there is a plan and reason for the unfolding of events.

Those that fear what is happening in the world and would rather not know will hate this film as it unveils the truth.  Of the 2,500+ prophecies spanning thousands of years; already 2,000+ have been fulfilled in exacting detail. So exactly why wouldn't the remaining 500+ prophecies left to be fulfilled not occur?  ... Especially when we see the world folding around the very framework necessary to conclude the last few events and foretold thousands of years ago?

In addition to merely prophecy, the ancient scrolls also provide detailed historical accounting of many lost civilizations including their kings, laws, and events. The prophecy documents also provide historical details of over 250 ancient cities which have always thought to be legend .  Not until this last century has the technology and archeological projects focused on verifying or disputing the existence of these cities.  As of today, they have already uncovered 150+ of these cities with exactly match the ancient scrolls.  The prophecies not only tell of future events but provide us with a detailed history spanning thousands of years which modern science and archeology has already verified and is continuing to verify almost on a daily basis.  So far there has never been an archeological  dig that has provided any evidence which disputes a single historical event or person or place as indicated in the scrolls.  On the contrary, all evidence gathered supports and confirms the scrolls accuracy and details described.

This movie is like non-other that I have ever seen. It kept me awake for days and has literally changed my life forever.",1315008000,5,2747,4.92407809110629
4262915,1,B0045JJ1O8,"As I write this review there are four existing reviews, each four-stars and exclaiming you *must* see this video. Admittedly I viewed the documentary with a skeptical mindset. I am not religious and do not believe in any gods.

I found nothing credible in the documentary to substantiate the dramatic claims. I would not recommend this video as a methodical, scientific, historical approach to the subject. As I viewed the video, I took notes and researched the people interviewed and the ""evidence"" revealed. I found nothing of merit in any of the additional sources on the web that refer to the people in the video nor to the sources which repeat similar claims.

So I would say if you are a christian fundamentalist with firmly-held beliefs that more or less line up with the claims of this video, you will want to watch this and it will reenforce your beliefs. On the other hand if you are in any way a skeptic about these beliefs already, and you are looking for solid, credible, impartial research, you will not find anything of value in this video.",1315008000,152,1055,4.697297297297298
4262916,5,B0045JJ1O8,If you do not believe in signs then do not watch this documentary.  This was interesting.  Factual evidence has shown the bible to be a true book and will fulfill it's content one day.  I was amazed to see how much of the biblical stories actually happened.,1314835200,5,257,4.425531914893617
4262917,4,B0045JJ1O8,Interesting video and informative for the person who is not already knowledgeable regarding biblical history and or prophecy. Does not intend to tout any one religion but highlights historical events and leaves the viewer with thought provoking ideas and information which he or she may wish to pursue further.,1308873600,9,310,5.346938775510204
4262918,4,B0045JJ1O8,"While ""The Final Prophecies"" is a fascinating and very well made documentary, it ultimately falls apart because of its overriding premise.  Namely, that numerous very specific prophecies made in the Bible which have already come true must be attributed either to the word of God or to pure chance.  And of course chance, at least as most people misunderstand it, cannot possibly account for the accuracy of so many prophecies.  The problem with this ""either-or"" paradigm is, first, that chance is not an entirely random occurrence for which no semblance of causality exists; but rather a number of possible outcomes deriving logically from a certain series of events, whether those events can be catalogued or not.  And the second problem with ""either-or"" as used in ""The Final Prophecies"" is that it completely discounts human intuition. What it says is that humans can only see into the future if they're looking through the eyes of God; that second sight, or clairvoyance, is not a human but only a divine attribute - yet there exists considerable evidence that this faculty does indeed exist in humans.

The thrust of the documentary is two-fold.  First and foremost is the contention that without prophecy the Bible loses all credibility; that is to say, if all prophecy is removed from the Bible, or dis-proven, the book virtually ceases to exist.  Therefore, it is crucial to prove the validity of biblical prophecy.  And, as a corollary, is the contention that the world is right now experiencing ""The Final Days.""  This is because certain events have recently taken place, and continue to take place, which are prophecied  to occur as the prelude to the End Times.  Therefore, it becomes as crucial to prove that these events can be directly traced to biblical prophecy as it is to verify prophecies which have already taken place.

The documentary notes that, of all peoples who have ever existed, only the Jewish people have retained their ancient identity through history.  And that the Jews have even retained that identity through numerous exiles from their original homeland and scatterings throughout the world - even down to retaining the original Hebrew writing.  In fact, this documentary is as much about the exceptional identity of the Jews as it is about biblical prophecy: the two go hand-in-hand in that proof of prophecy also verifies the Jews' unique position as God's ""Chosen People.""

As might be expected, the documentary attributes all prophetic events to the word of God; and dismisses those secularists who insist upon finding rational as opposed to supernatural explanations for prophecy as mis-guided and perhaps lost souls.  It attributes the skepticism of secular scientists to the historical events portrayed in the Bible as deriving from their realization that to certify these events as authentic is necessarily to accept the existence of God.  Which reinforces the ""either-or"" paradigm with which the documentary began with another ""either-or"" - namely, that the historical events either happened because of God's intervention or they did not happen at all.  But, once again, this presents a false dichotomy; because the historical events could have happened even if they do not reflect divine intervention.  In sum, be very wary of ""either-or"" or ""black and white"" situations. They can foil even the best made arguments.",1306540800,16,3361,5.145220588235294
4262919,5,B0045JJ1O8,"I am personally acquainted with two of the individuals in this compelling DVD who have been guests in my home on several occasions.

This unbiased documentary is a vital tool equipping viewers for the perilous times we now live. Seeing is believing--the factual evidence is indisputable as we see prophecy unfold daily before our very eyes.  It will help skeptics and believers alike to connect the dots and gain a much clearer perspective that would otherwise be obscured through the mainstream media.

I highly encourage EVERYONE to view this DVD and by all means share it with friends, family and neighbors. Don't delay. I guarantee it will shake you up and wake you up!",1304726400,7,673,4.885964912280702
4262920,5,B0045JJ1O8,"As a Pastor, I highly encourage people get this DVD. This movie left me speechless. If there were any doubts left in me about the hour in which we live, this ""The Final Prophecies"" has completely removed them. The film makers show a tremendous amount insight prophetically backed up by loads of Archeological & Historical evidence. This film brings end time events to life and I was glued to the TV screen from the moment I turned it on. It is a must see for believers and non-believers too for that matter. So much evidence is hard to explain away as being anything less than what it is, God calling to this generation to believe on his son Jesus Christ before it is too late....Joh 1:12  ""But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name""",1296172800,15,807,4.344370860927152
4262921,5,B0045JJ1O8,"I love prophecy, end of the world scenarios and ancient history which is why I was drawn to this movie, I even pre-ordered it before it went up for sale on amazon. I thought it would be a good documentary because of the producers who made it and some of the other things they have done but this movie it far better than what I expected. It's by no means a religious or Bible bias film and actually mentions very little about religion as so many other prophecy movies do. This film is the first I've seen that actually takes REAL archaeological and scientific evidence with experts from New York to Israel that discuss statistical probabilities and ancient records outside of the Bible. It's almost impossible to explain here in a review as this is a film you really have to see to believe! Let's just say this left me with a sense that you just witnessed a whole new sense of reality and really makes you reconsider everything in our world from the war on terror to the credibility of the some of the Biblical events we've all heard about but few believe. Do yourself a favor and even if you don't believe in this stuff, just get this movie!!

My beautiful fiance and I were looking for a movie to watch and this one was suggested at the bottom. Totally different from what I was looking for. Maybe a new released Scifi or Marvel movie. Marvelous it was and truly appropriate considering the times we are living in. What's the probability of me choosing a Scifi or action film, maybe 10,000 to 1. A coincidence this was not.

Unfortunately, this pseudo-documentary offers only the worst that the genre offers. We have a deep sincere voice giving us a warning, likes its the trailer for the next Avengers. We have panning shots of urban excess and dire warnings.

But there's a problem, and it is this:
Just because something is written down, does not make it true.

Does anyone believe the literal word of Gone With The Wind? 2001 Space Odyssey? How about Thor?
No. And we know why?

This documentary came across a part finger wagging father (""I warned you this would happen"") and part knee hugging needy ex-girlfriend (""why won't you believe me?"").

4263031,5,B0045JJ1O8,"This video was well researched and presented. Unfortunately if you are not familiar with the scriptures, your comprehension will be lacking. Simply put... If you do not have the ""education"" or mindset of testing or evaluating scripture, you won't be able to see the light of prophecies. I can see where many people will be oblivious to the facts pointed out in this video, if they lack this knowledge. This video allows an awesome presentation of details relative to History, Politics and changes occurring in the world as the scriptures state. Again I say... Unless people read and test the scriptures, they may not be able to comprehend what was said years ago and what is now unbelievably coming to life. It is strange to me that people would make comments without testing what is said and the validity of the Bible. The approach in the video was direct and meaningful, but again may easily ""go over someone's head"" if they lack the Biblical knowledge.

Anybody can read a book, and later watch a movie based on that book, and comment, but you cannot watch this movie and blindly make a comment, when you have not read the Book of the Bible. If you are willing to read THE BOOK of the Bible, then this video will be great to test and compare. You may want to watch it twice; the video gives brief notations to research in scripture. It is fascinating when you know all that is pertinent to these prophecies and are aware of the fast changes in this world! Your jaw will drop when watching this video, furthermore when you know the scriptures!

Further Reading available on Amazon is: The Daniel Factor by James Jacob Prasch - Kindle
The Daniel Project is a research project, started by an Agnostic who went through long strides of testing the Bible and teaming together with a ""non-religious"" examiner, to investigate the scriptures. The expositor of this documentary holds a degree in Philosophy and has a very nice approach, perspective and presentation, along with the examiner. The Daniel Project is an interesting video, that you may learn of, through Kindle.  The Daniel Factor or Daniel Project video, will go well with Final Prophecies.",1365984000,,2147,4.766129032258065

After quoting scripture for past prophecies that have come true and providing the hisorical accounts that prove it, the film become much more generalized, stops qutoing the scriptures of many of the end time prophecies and stops giving factual examples of owrld events that foreshadow the fulfillment, they just make broad-based claims for both.  There is so much out there that could be used for a meticulous and convincing arguement - this film fails to bring that out, much to my disappointment.

I would have to agree with several other reviewers - this film plays to those that already believe and provides too little detail to sway those that are sceptical, and I say that as a believer.

4263050,3,B0045JJ1O8,"This film actually starts out quite wonderfully in presenting the information for the validity of the Bible and what it records as legitimate history that can be relied upon, but more importantly, the existence of the True God and His interaction in human history to accomplish His pre-stated goals. I thoroughly enjoyed the inclusion of the accurate telling of how the Red Sea crossing occurred. Until recently, the pillar in Saudi Arabia could be viewed via Google Earth, but has since been blocked. I have heard as well that the Saudi government may have removed that pillar now, but I have not been able to verify that as of yet. And the makers of this film are absolutely correct that the stance of most in academia is that if it is from the Bible it should be suspect if not all together rejected. Unfortunately, as is common in prophecy teaching, after 48 minutes into the film the contributors become shaky and the evidence nil for their claims. This actually has a very reasonable cause. The frame of reference they are speaking from is pre-tribulational or possibly even mid-tribulational futurist view. The pre- or mid-trib theories were developed only about 200-400 years ago at the latest and rely heavily on the book of Daniel, Daniel 9:27 specifically, with light reference to Matthew 24 and a very few other places to support it. The theory was developed by Jesuits and then later amended and carried on through various groups or individuals such as the Millerites and more well known characters such as John Darby and C.I. Scolfield. The origins of the theory have been hidden from the general Protestant Christian population and even today are denied by some being it is a Catholic theory and not in the line of the early church fathers or those of the Reformation who subscribed to a linear-historic view.

A prophecy theory that was developed 200-400 years ago which bases its sole foundation on Daniel 9:27 is automatically suspect if not all together in error  because Daniel was told to ""seal the book until the time of the end"" (the answer could not be figured out) and the ""time of the end"" was not 200-400 years ago--as the film itself unwillingly reveals when they say Israel becoming a nation in 1948 and having it's capitol restored in 1967 is a sign of the ""last generation"" prior to Christ's return.

Anyone interested in prophecy should get the free e-book at www dot teachingfaith dot com for an in-depth yet simple explanation of Matthew 24, Daniel 9:27 and much much more. I certainly hope the makers of this film and it's contributors will consider rethinking their prophetic views.",1345852800,,2618,4.8133333333333335

So what if our God is evolving and wants many different perspectives, like native religions that call him/her by different names, like aboriginal perspectives which live their life within a totally different world?

I am a Bible believer; however, one needs to be careful with ""prophesy."" This video mentions Matthew 24:34 with the assumption that ""the vine"" or ""the fig tree"" is Israel, but there is no evidence for that whatsoever.  As a matter of fact, one only has to read to Matthew 24:36 to see that only the Father knows the time. The video doesn't mention the metaphor of the fig tree being Isreal or get into the symbolism at all, just states that the Bible says ""this generation shall not pass away"" and mentions that this generation is the one that sees the rebuilding of Israel. Again, there is no evidence for that whatsoever. That is something Hal Lindsey said way back when to defend that the world was going to end in 1988 (40 years after the rebuilding). The video assumes the listener believes that the fig tree is Israel (for which, by the way, there is contradicting symbolism in the Bible), and without that belief, it makes it hard for me to take in the rest of this video.

I couldn't, so I still don't know - and now, after enduring it, I could care less. A search of this film at IMDb says nothing of any awards given anywhere. A further search of the director, writer, and cinematographer, Brent Miller, Jr., reveals that there are no other films to his credit - this is it. Listed at same under ""Stars:"" Narrator, KD Bowe - ""The Final Prophecies"". Ronnie Cohen, seen throughout the movie as some kind of ""expert"" - you guessed it! - ""The Final Prophecies"" - no other information given and no other film, TV, entertainment or any other credits of any kind. Lastly, there is Allen Farmer, and thank God, Jesus, Buddha and the Holy Ghost, he has credits: under the 'Miscellaneous Crew' header, two credits: [2009] Mermaid Girl: The Last Six Months (TV documentary) (narrator); [2008] Mermaid Girl (TV movie) (narrator). Under 'Actor', one credit: [2010] ""Cellblock 6: Female Lock Up"" (TV series).

Wikipedia.org is listed in the film's closing credits as a source for information used in this so called, ""documentary"".

If this ""special effect"" wasn't so annoying, it would have been almost comical.) There is one reference available on Wikipedia.org that is far more interesting than this unqualified and unsubstantiated montage of interviews with ""unknown"" experts and ""public domain"" newsreels and travelogs that might possibly explain: 1.) how Israel has TRULY managed to survive (i.e., and not just by ""some series of small unknown and unexplainable events"", as the film's personnel would have you believe) and 2.) where the financial backing for this cinematic piece of Swiss cheese may have initiated from.

A person has no responsibility for his/her actions because they can be forgiven. Jesus lived a life of integrity, no christian religion promotes that aspect.

4263101,5,B0045JJ1O8,"This is a very good DVD about Bible Prophecy, and is a perfect for someone who does not know anything or very little about bible prophecy. It slowly but engagingly walks the viewer through not only what Bible prophecy is, what they say about the past present and future, but they also show us why they are true and can be trusted.

First we are confronted about what is happening in the world today and the important question what is going on. Has what is going on in the world been predicted by the ancient Biblical prophets?

Ronnie Cohen narrates this documentary and he has many experts chiming in. Cohen shows us what the Old Testament is and how it was translated and how how we can trust there accuracy. We find out about how the Jewish people or Israelites valued these scriptures and protected them and the measures they took to preserve them for all time. There are some interesting things about the Jewish writings, for one they not only show thee victories but there defeats, no other nations ancient writings show themselves in such a bad light as the scriptures show the Israelites. The Hebrew that they are written in is the same spoken and written today, which is unprecedented in the worlds languages.

Then we are show some key events of the bible and how Archeology has proven them to be true. For example the migration of Israel and the exodus from Egypt. The destruction of Sodom and Gamorra. As wells as proof of 100s of Biblical cities and Israel's kings.

Then we are shown about Jesus prophecy in 30 AD about the coming destruction of the Temple and the scattering of the Jews all over the world. That was fulfilled in 70 AD by the Romans.  Jesus prophecy in Matthew chapter 24 also talks about How the Jews would be back and the temple as well in the end times. Not only did our LORD prophecy it but many Old Testament prophets as well, in great detail. Such as in Ezekiel chapter 36. The Prophecies ell us Israel is the KEY to end times prophecy. And that they would be surrounded by enemies an there would be much conflict. The Wars of 1948, 1967, 1973 and the terrorism even since should prove that to you. Over 50 prophecies have been fulfilled by the regathering of Israel.

Cohen shows us also that these prophecies cannot be the result of chance, and cannot be rationalizes away. Its not 1, 2 or 3 prediction the Bible has made 100s of predictions that have true to the exact detail.

From hear we move on to some of the end tome prophecies. How Israel would be reestablished and surrounded by enemies. How the world would move toward a one world currency, one world religion and one world government system. How a very charismatic man would rise up and be a political miracle worker and the people will demand he be put in charge. He will sign peace treaties with many nations, with the key one being with Israel a 7 year peace treaty. He will seem to bring about peace for a short time. But it will be short lived. When it all breaks down it will lead to a series of battles and lead the world to Armageddon. Before Mankind can exterminate itself Jesus the LORD returns to stop it.

You may ask why the LORD allows all this, well there are two reasons. One is he ha predicted it in advance and he has told you in advance. Its to lead you and everyone to him. The second reason is free will, this destruction is the culmination of mankind's own desires. Bit there is still grace in it, many will turn to the LORD in these terrible times.

In closing I would say this is a very good DVD, especially for those who do not know Bible prophecy. This would be a good stocking stuffer at Christmas time.",1323302400,52,3630,4.414050822122571

AS a Christian myself, I found very little that I didn't already know -- and I'm not the ""best read,"" so I was shocked that one reviewer was ""shaken for days"" after viewing this film. I did, however, find interesting the film's discussion that all would see the Anti-Christ as a wonderful, peace-making figure. This ironic twist finds me stumped. How would we know? How would we react negatively over world peace? I love the idea of world peace!  Wouldn't that be the most wonderful event in the history of humanity's ""death and destruction""?

One example they use to validate Biblical prophecies is Mark 13: 1-2 where Christ says the temple will be destroyed and no stone will be left on another.  The temple was in fact totally destroyed in 70 AD about forty years after the death of Christ.  Mark the evangelist is the suspected writer of the book of Mark and it is assumed he wrote the the book of Mark around 70 AD shortly after the destruction of the Temple.

Second, it appears to be a homage to Israel. If it is, it's rather left handed because it becomes apparent that much if not all of the war in the Middle East could have been avoided if there hadn't been Judaism, and further, that future wars (so called prophesies) couldn't happen without Judaism.
So are Jews the good guys or the bad guys? Or does God just like to jerk around humanity and lay the blame on the Jews or lay the blame on the rest of the world for picking on the Jews?
Third, if all of this MUST come true, as the film says (it's in the Bible, the Bible is absolutely true, blah, blah) then what difference does knowing it in advance make?
Fourth, a real 'prophesy,' to have any value, has to outline what will happen AND when. The Bible prophesies are like astrology, vague enough to be tacked onto almost any bad event, and never pinned down as to even a particular millenium, much less a year.

What if the one world currency they were talking about is actually credit cards?
And the one world government is actually the worldwide movement toward democracy?
And the one world religion is actually the religion of money?
Most people are not following in the footsteps of those who knew God intimately, such as Jesus Christ, because they are too worldy concerned.
If there is a God in the true sense of the word, then God has a handle on this world without our trying so hard to control it, others and
where it's all going.

Jesus was a poor man (one cannot serve both God and mammon), who avoided social and physical relationships and yet was completely humble, unselfish, compassionate, tolerant and forgiving of others. All his thoughts, actions and speech were devoted to God.
How much time do the so called religious actually spend thinking about their creator?
How many actions are devoted to God rather than to'getting ahead', being busy with recreation or arguing personal viewpoints
to death?
How many wars have been fought because one religion thinks it is the one?

If we are in the final days, it is because we have lost all humility, honesty and clear thinking, the ability to forgive, the reverence and awe
for an Infinite and All Loving Creator. Seems to me that if we kept our attention directed on those things, God would take care of the rest.",1318204800,18,1656,4.783216783216783

If their truth is so powerful and correct, why did they not let any scholar give a difference of opinion? Also, in the last two minutes, they give the ultimate scare. The standard religious scare tactic, don't be caught on the wrong side of the fence.

Hebrew, Latin and many more ancient languages are used by scholars to read old books. They are not languages used in daily communication.

More interesting were the archaeological findings, as I like reading histories, yet only a few tidbits show up (like evidence of Moses crossing the Red Sea) and then they are not mentioned again (seriously, the most miraculous act in the Old Testament, and they examine it for all of 2 minutes). This show is repetitive, with the narrator announcing a bit of information that is then repeated by the four experts that appear. There is no countering viewpoint to explain archaeological findings, nor any other prophecy from any other religion, both of which I found disappointing. I wanted a show about Prophecies--not a show trying to convince me that God exists.
  It is ludicrous when they use ""Oh, I cannot calculate the odds of this or that happening"" as proof that God must be at work. Well, I cannot calculate the odds for a single spermatozoa (out of millions) to reach and enter an ovum, nor can I calculate the odds of a marathon runner winning in under 2 hours and 10 minutes, but both events have happened. That is simply not a rational argument. Furthermore, to accept biblical authors/prophets as being prophets, one must know the date of their writings. Heck, in the Book of Daniel specific mention of king Cyrus (a historical figure) helps pinpoint the time of authorship...and that isn't mentioned (lazy film-making). Being wide-eyed and reverent to God is not proof!
  To sum up. This is trying to prove the existence of God. I respect their faith, but I fell asleep twice trying to make it thru this. Make of that what you will.",1317772800,5,1688,4.711864406779661

For how thin this archeological evidence is, take for example the finding of the word ""Israel"" in an ancient Egyptian stele - JUST that word - and that is used as unarguable evidence that the Israelites were in Egypt and, as was described in the bible, had to flee enslavement. The ""scientific proof"" really doesn't get any more substantial than that. It is repeated numerous times that countless prophecies contained in the bible have come to pass in detail and therefore the prophecies of our future shall also come to pass. Do they discuss any of these prophecies that came true before? Other than the fact that the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed and the Israelites had to flee and then the state of Israel was created following WWII, the answer is no. Yet we are told over and over that NUMEROUS prophecies have come true... Oh, and you're also warned that a great deception will fall upon the land in the end of days (which we are in now, according to the prophecy because of four factors: rumors of wars and political, economic, and religious unity... none of which have actually happened but facts get in the way of the documentary so just trust their word on it) so if you don't believe what is right in front of your eyes and should be obvious, well... then you're just being deceived.

Read the Bible for yourself, the real prophesies aren't that great for mankind, but Jesus is supposed to be our savior.

Jesus slaughters 200 million people at battle of Armageddon in the book of Revelation. Then according to the Bible Jesus casts the unbelievers into eternal torment, where they are falling, being eaten by worms, and being burned alive-all while continuing to regenerate.

That's what it actually says. Not this 'glorified' version, which is an extreme perversion of what the Bible actually says.

'God' is a fantastic tormentor and a so/so savior. His son only stayed in hell three days, before getting out, but according the Bible a normal human will be stuck there forever. How is that 'paying the price'. Maybe Obama can pay off the national debt with dryer lint, but I doubt it. Just to visulized this, think of Jesus as spending 1/100000000000000000000000000000000000 of the time in hell that say, your cousins or your grandparents.

If you believe Jesus is tormenting your dead children and grandparents in hell right now, because they didn't say the magic words or had another religion, then watch this movie. Maybe your loving 'God' will turn you into a pillar of salt too, in a narcissistic whim, like the Bible portrays him.

Growing up I've been to over 6,000 Baptist church services. It greatly annoys me to see this to stuff proliferate. People only focus on good parts of the Bible and forget about the parts that sound ridiculous.

This is NOT the same as ""The Coming Convergence"" other than it also discusses current events and Bible prophecy.
This is less visually dynamic than ""Convergence"", but RIVETING in the discussion and opinions give by 5 experts in this field.
This DVD adds more discussion and insight into current prophetic events similar to those in ""Convergence"", but with different expert points of view.  I though this was only an add-on DVD to the Ingenuity Films series, but it is NOT.  If you are concerned about Bible prophecy and what is happening in our world today... this is a must-have DVD to add to your collection.  Trying to convert a friend to the Christian faith?
