They are never repetitive , and no two versions of a piece are ever the same.......

I just wish I had a larger TV screen to view the concert. My Hi Fi does the music justice , and a darkened room heightens the atmosphere generated........

They are in a league of their own.",1368662400,,403,4.141025641025641
8343539,1,B001UEFHL2,"It seems TD has become from great improvisers to impostors. The recent performances with this new line-up of two guys, two ladies and master Edgar in addition to son's past involvement have all seem to be an act of miming with smiles and gestures to facilitate the charade. It is very obvious to see the music does not corresponds with the instrumentation. This is comparable to foreign movies particularly Chinese karate that the voice dubbing and lips movement are either delayed or in excess. It would be good if they can replicate the live improvisations of the Baumann and Schmoelling live shows but again this is like a shot in the moon. Too many egos and resentment involved. It is very evident that this new line up of TD are incapable to jam and provide an improvised performance. Possible reasons that they are not as professional, creative and exploratory as the classic line up of TD. Sadly EF yielded to this situation. Many reunion tours have happened like The Police, Led Zep, Black Sabbath et al. TD is no exception if others can why can't they. I think it is better for this new line up to retire and make ways to organize a reunion tour with Franke, Baumann and Schmoelling then we can all rest in peace!",1306454400,2,1222,4.610091743119266
8343540,3,B001UEFHL2,"This is a long, technically excellent DVD of a typical TD performance as of recent years and the music covers a wide period in TD's back catalogue which should satisfy most fans. The picture is crystal clear, the sound is rich and vibrant. My criticism of the filming would be that there are never any close up shots the members playing the music. This is what you'd expect especially when there is a important lead being played by someone which for spoils things a little for me. I have to admit that I have my suspicions that TD are miming to a backing. There are times when the percussionist performs drum rolls that can't be heard and when her movements just don't tally with what is being heard (Flashpoint's drumming in particular), the snare drum keeps sounding during tom tom fills and at one point she comes in late even though the drum sounds don't! The hand movements of the keyboard players that are just about visible from behind the keyboard, also seem to bear little relation to what's being heard and I found this very irritating after a short time and it became a distraction which spoiled my enjoyment of this DVD. However the guitarists were clearly playing live since their hand movements, chord shapes and fretboard positions matched what was heard throughout the DVD. Personally I'd rather hear a technically less than perfect performce for the sake of a new, live interpretation. I have the CDs if I want to hear the original tracks",1285027200,3,1455,4.6875
8343541,4,B001UEFHL2,"First off, great concert DVD.  The ending finale was totally unexpected and awesome.  ""House of the Rising Sun"" TD style is even better than their cover of ""Purple Haze.""  However, the copy I received was not Region 1 NTSC as advertised.  It was PAL.  As such I was only able to run it on my computer's DVD drive instead of my PS3.  Maybe mine was unusual, I don't know, but it was enough for me to drop a star.  :(",1282435200,5,415,4.1125
8343542,5,B001UEFHL2,"I had only heard Rubicon and Phaedra prior to purchasing this DVD, and I must admit to having the preconceived notion that TD could never do live what they did in the studio. I found out just how wrong that notion was!
  Sitting down to view the performance immediately showed the incredible talent that is Tangerine Dream! One thing I watch for is the interaction between the band members as they play, and this band shows that they are totally enjoying the performance as much as the audience. Band members smile and make eye contact with each other, demonstrating their love of the music they make. Iris Camaa, the drummer, wears a perpetual smile and appears to have the limitless energy required of a percussionist of her obvious talent. Linda Spa, the saxaphonist, has that ""bluesy"" sort of manner of playing that just gives a life of its own to her playing. The string instruments are played by performers that can coax the most intricate of sounds from their instruments, as do the keyboardists and the sequencer/samplers they command. For those that are fans of another progressive band like King Crimson, think of Robert Fripp on a keyboard instead of a guitar (and lit by more than a 7 1/2 watt light bulb while playing!).
  I absolutely recommend this DVD to any fans of good live performance, no matter what genre you prefer. I went and bought the TD DVD ""Orange Odyssy"" immediately after seeing this DVD. My favorite song would have to be ""The Girl on the Stairs"".",1274918400,7,1478,4.694980694980695
8343543,5,B001UEFHL2,"Finally!!!, ""Live at the Tempodrome Berlin"" available here at Amazon and I can write about it.

This is the BEST Tangerine Dream video that I know of. Best production ever. Crystal Clear sound and video. Excellent performances.

I really recommend this DVD to a die-hard fans and everyone else looking up into TD music. Three hours of pure orange vitamin for your soul.

I think this was one of the last live performances for Jerome Froese together with TD. Sad thing.

Iris Camma with her great smile and energy, as always. Nice.

Linda Spa, excellent performances, and, ""linda"" (beautiful) with her long long hair. Very cool.

Thorsten Quaeschning, very proud when they played ""La Libration"" (one of my favorites tracks from Jeanne D'Arc).

Also, great performances from Gerard Gradwohl and Bernhard Beibl.

Of course, Edgar Froese at his best. Nice concert introduction with his armonica.

I could spend many more minutes writing about this DVD. In short, this is the one you should have.

Enjoy.

Saludos from Mexico City.",1250035200,12,1026,5.011834319526627
