8360494,5,B002AWM0UY,"Not your ordinary romantic Dracula story (yay).  What I really love are the not so ordinary nuns.  I never cared much for the overly romantic Dracula stories and this movie does delve into it a bit much, but at least it's not nauseating.  At least the ""vampire killer's assistant"" doesn't get to steal the bride away.  I hate it when that happens because it is a ""feel good "" movie that makes me want to blow chunks.  But that is certainly not the case in this movie for indeed the vampire killer and his apprentice did not fare well.  This is not a movie that follows the overly used formula of Dracula getting burned by the always triumphant Van Helsing type opponent.  The vampire killer's apprentice does not get to ride off into the mushy sunset with ""Dracula's runaway bride"".  And I couldn't be happier for it.",1368230400,2,817,4.510204081632653
