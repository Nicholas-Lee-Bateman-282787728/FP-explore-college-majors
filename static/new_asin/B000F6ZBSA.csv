8118131,5,B000F6ZBSA,"At age 16, from London to New York, from theater to theater, acclaimed young actress Ethel Barrymore faced clapping hands and roaring crowds. She tried to calm them down. She said: ""That's all there is; there isn't any more"". Bristling with talent, the Barrymores dominated Broadway. In 1903, Ethel and her two brothers, Lionel and John, were each performing in their own Broadway theater productions, all at the same time. Their parents, Maurice and Georgiana Barrymore, acted with some of the greatest stage personalities of the mid-Victorian era. But when their three young children arrived, Maurice had little time for them. Sadly, he shipped them off to Philadelphia, where they were raised by Mrs. Louisa Drew, Georgiana's mother. Mrs. Drew was known as ""Mummum"". The lack of parental guidance hurt all three children: the most young John; who started drinking around age 14. John Barrymore would marry and divorce 4 times. Lionel, Ethel, and John followed their famous parents into theatrical success. Young John, thanks to the movies, would earn over $3,000,000 by the end of the 1930's. Yet all three Barrymores struggled with finance, and in the end, each died nearly penniless. John Barrymore died in 1942, at age 60, with his brother at his side. His last whispered word was the name of the woman he loved the most: ""Mummum"". ""Biography. The Barrymores"" presents rare archival footage, including clips from John Barrymore's silent ""Raffles(1917)"",and a clip from his oldest surviving sound film, Warner Bros. 1929 ""Show of Shows"", with his full-costume monologue as Shakespeare's Richard III. It is a startling window into one of the world's classic actors, still in his prime. Nearly all of his other stage-work is now lost forever. Here also is behind-the-scenes footage of John Barrymore filming ""Beau Brummel(1924)"" and ""When a Man Loves(1927)"". Here also is a rare clip of his newsreel interview after a New York performance of ""Hamlet(1922)"". ""Biography"" also takes a glance at the Barrymore children. Some have the ""Barrymore Curse"". Some are just children. Hre are Diana Barrymore, John Barrymore Jr., and Drew Barrymore. Drew Barrymore overcame a teen-age dependency on cocaine, and may-or-may-not live in Culver City(not far from the old MGM studios). This documentary of the Barrymores is a chronicle of highly talented artists. Sadly, in the case of John, the story of his life resembles a classic Shakespearean tragedy. There is some more to say; there's surely much more to know, but for now, ""That's all there is. There isn't any more"".",1241827200,,2563,5.163461538461538
8118132,5,B000F6ZBSA,"I saw this biography for the first time a couple of days while I was home ill.  This was one of the most informative and entertaining biographies that I've ever seen.  What a fascinating story of their history.  I'd always considered myself somewhat knowledgeable in regards to their movies, lives, etc. and this really surprised me as to what I didn't know.  Such a gifted yet tragic family.  Hopefully, the curse that has seemingly overshadowed that family will be lifted by the talents and optimistic outlook of Drew Barrymore.",1231286400,,530,4.910112359550562
