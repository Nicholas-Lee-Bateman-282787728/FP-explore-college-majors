8648582,4,B00J6V1RQK,If you are looking for a Blu Ray of The Spirit of the Beehive this is it. It's worth noting that this listing is for a Spanish language Blu Ray. There are no subtitles at all. If you don't understand Spanish then you are going to be stuck looking at the amazing image quality. The picture is fantastic and does justice to this beautiful classic film.,1503619200,,350,4.318181818181818
