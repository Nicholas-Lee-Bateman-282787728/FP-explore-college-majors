Written and directed by the Master himself, ""The Sinister Urge"" (1960) explores the smut racket with the same amateurish incompetence as ""The Violent Years."" There are a few Woodian touches in this dreary expos, but it's a rough-going 71 minutes. Ed's last ""mainstream"" release before his sad descent into sleaze fiction.",1419292800,2,451,4.947368421052632

8276900,5,B001AD8G2K,"OK, it IS an Ed Wood movie so it ain't all that good. The acting was wooden, everything was done on the cheap as expected, ect, ect. But not a bad movie all and all. The plot was easy to follow, there was a little bit of intrigue. And the fight scene featuring Ed Wood himself posing a a thug, which seemed to go on forever, was worth the price of the movie by itself.

Negatives........the ""burned to order"" format is kind of crappy. The root menu is confusing although if you just start with the first thing to come up you will get through it easily enough. That could have been done better. No info on the slip cover either, other than the title and what amounts to an ad for Sinister Cinema, but nothing about the actual movie itself. That could be doctored up a bit to at least point out that this is a Woodie. But it seems if you are ordering this in the first place you would know that.

Buy it, it is a ""Lost Woodie"" that most folks don't even know about let alone have seen.",1281312000,8,983,4.114583333333333
