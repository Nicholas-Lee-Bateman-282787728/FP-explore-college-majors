2546713,5,B000EYJHDS,"FIRST, THIS IS AN A&E MOVIE BROADCAST JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO NOT THE MOVIE OUT IN THEATERS NOW(05/02/06)

  this a&e movie is the first of the 9/11 movies out and if they are all done as well as this one then we will be the greater for them.i was moved to tears as the story of these REAL HEROS as they made a call i hope none of us has to ever make again.

  the casting of actors not seen that often in the roles really helped leave the idea that hollywood was cashing in at the door for me as i could believe these people were the real deal. they never crossed the line into movie heros they were just people who felt they had to do something, and thank GOD they did.

  what the people of flight 93 did should never be forgoten and thanks to this movie ,it won't!!!",1146528000,5,768,3.9673202614379086

Me myself as a 29 year old Army veteran has difficulty watching. The sense of how small the world is and how much some countries hate our freedom, economy and our power. It shows how danger this world is and if you close your eyes to extremists of the world they will eventually find you and try to destroy what is dear to you. Why we fight and must continue to fight.

2546716,5,B000EYJHDS,"""Flight 93"" is a riveting, powerful television film that recreates the events of that tragic September morning, as forty brave passengers banned together to re-take their hijacked plane from terrorists who are hell-bent on crashing it into either the White House or the Capitol Building. Outstanding performances, breathtaking visual effects, and exceptional storytelling fuel the film's powerful presentation of the price that was paid on 9/11. I highly recommend it!

2546727,5,B000EYJHDS,"This movie is one of my favorites.  Very well done.  I love how they used unknown actors.  Using well known actors would have distracted from the story.

A lot of people say ""united 93"" was better, or that this one ""flight 93"" was better.  Myself, i like flight93 a little bit more than united 93.  That being said, comparing the two, even though they are the same story is like comparing apples and oranges.  United 93 has more to do with the military aspect of the whole thing, while Flight 93 deals with the human aspect (i.e. the individual passengers and their families).

They are both worth watching, but Flight 93 still makes me tear up.  It's a great movie, and well worth the time.

I recommend watching both, but keep in mind, each movie comes at the same event with different perspectives, and whichever perspective you prefer (the military or the personal) is going to determine which you like best.",1322438400,2,912,4.608695652173913

That I am giving this film this high of a mark is a rare thing.

If I had to choose between this and the Hollywood film ""UNITED 93"", I would choose this one.  This film is the best movie about 09-11 that you've never heard of  -  but it is the one that you should have.

2546730,5,B000EYJHDS,"Although you know the ending before the movie begins, this is still a real cliffhanger and nail biter. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.

The movie is excellent and extremely well-done. It is a great tribute to the men and women who died on Flight 93, and the courage and love they showed in the face of death. They were real martyrs! The movie was also very respectfully done, considering the sensitive nature of this event, the feelings of the families involved, and the trauma they experienced. I think it stands as a living testament for these families to be proud of.

I don't think it would hurt for anyone to watch this and re-live the horrible experience that terrorism brought to our shores that day and, because of it, to recommit themselves to personal involvement in the life of our country and its government so that this may never happen again. As President Abraham Lincoln said at Gettysburg:
--------------------------------------------------------------
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.",1283212800,4,1438,4.865306122448979

Seeing the wives talk to their husbands one last time is tough to see.  To know that it was because a bunch of ignorant idiots who wanted to see Allah sooner than later caused it, is even more maddening.  Oh don't profile no no no we would not want those moz-lim males who obviously do not even hold day jobs suddenly coming to an airport near you.

2546745,2,B000EYJHDS,"Slick theatrical reproduction of the official storyline of Flight 93. Does not address the fact that cell phones ( at that time) do not work above 2000 ft. altitude and the plane was far above that when the first calls supposedly came in. One of the callers called his mother and used his last name. Who does that when they call their mother? He also asked, "" Don't you believe it's me?"" Most telling smoking gun briefly glossed over in this film is the fact that the crash site was a crater about 30 ft. in diameter and 10 ft. deep with small pieces of light aluminum scattered around. No engines, tail section, wings, seats, bodies, luggage, nothing you would find at commercial airliner crash site no matter what the angle of impact. The first responders said, "" There's no airplane here, let's look in the woods for it."" The plane was never found in the woods or anywhere else.

2546746,4,B000EYJHDS,"Flight 93 does many things right. It provides a believable cast (good guys and bad guys) without any star power getting in the way. It keeps conjecture about what happened onboard to a minimum, in that most of the dialog is with people on the ground whom can verify what was actually said. That level of authenticity is appreciated.

However, the film has two flaws, one minor, and one major. The first flaw the film's concentration on the emotions of the passengers and loved ones on the ground. I would have preferred more action and passenger plotting, even at the risk of more conjecture.

The second flaw, and the one that removes the film from contention for five-star status, is that it does not take us with the passengers in their final moments of resolve, terror and courage as they try to wrest the plane from the control of the fanatics, only to have the plane driven into the ground. Instead, we only see the plane from a farmer's perspective, on the ground looking into the sky. This seems an uncharacteristic moment of cowardice on the part of the filmmakers, to have taken us so far on this flight with the passengers with whom we feel emotional connection, admiration and even love, but not let us fully participate in their horrible, tragic end. The film forces us to abandon them at the moments when we most should have been with them.",1169337600,6,1354,4.614107883817427

This is a tense, yet tastefully-done re-enactment of events on board United Flight 93, which was the fourth airplane captured that day. As depicted in the movie, some of the passengers are phoning their families and telling them goodbye, while others are planning a group attack on the terrorists in the cockpit of the plane.  Throughout the movie, distraught families are pictured watching t.v. or talking to their loved ones who are passengers on Flight 93.

Comparison to United 93 is obvious - both movies are about the same disaster and both were released in the same year -

United 93 in cinemas and Flight 93 on cable TV).

Whilst United 93 involves a comprehensive telling of the events of the day, Flight 93 mainly revolves around what

took place on the doomed airplane. Therefore we see an indepth look at the passengers responses and calls to loved

ones. Imagine receiving a phone call from a loved one to say that their plane has been hijacked after seeing planes

fly into the WTC on TV???

Obviously being a movie made for TV, it gathered less publicity than United 93. For those who have seen United 93,

I would urge you to view Flight 93. I certainly don't want to say one movie is 'better' than the other, but their

From the beginning to the end I was absorbed with every detail. It was as if I was REALLY THERE. My heart was thumping as the hi-jackers glanced at each other in anticipation of what was to happen.

I know I shouldn't say this, but it is amazing how these high-jackers kept their cool and nerve. It was clear a few of them wanted to get on with the high-jacking, but the leader remeined ice-cool waiting for the right time. If I was one of them, I would have been perspiring and cracking up. This was the real deal for them.

I saw World Trade with Nicolas Cage on Saturday, and it awful in comparison with this. As a previous comment mentioned, the actors were unknown, which added to to reality of the situation. Throw in a Nicolas Cage and one rolls one's eyes in ""not another American hero film"".

I have been on the plane of terror

In the bombs and every cry

I look at our country

In a world I will not lie

For I AM the people

I will never die

Will I live to see tomorow

Lose their lives

But I pray for every man and women

Children who kneel and pray

God I will never let them take my freedom

Or give my soul away.

2546758,5,B000EYJHDS,"What is so particularly powerful about this movie is that it keeps us in the moment as if we were participants.  We are another passenger on the plane without any more knowledge of our fellow passengers than we would have on any other flight.  We get to know each other as the tragedy progresses.  Then we are a fly on the wall at the FAA, flight control, and NORAD.  We get the minute by minute unfolding of the events of that morning as they unfolded for the participants.  It is also worth noting that some of the military ""actors"" are the actual people, who were there and acted in those roles on 9/11,

One of the most egregious of human activities is the use of 20/20 hindsight combined with a more than imperfect understanding of what actually happened during an event in order to assign blame.  Too often, a fiction is concocted about what happened in order to create an even worse fiction about what should have happened.  Reality unfolds as it doe.  Yes, people do make faulty decisions, but that is part of reality.  However, very often the decisions are neither right nor wrong at the time based upon the information actually available.  And when something is happening that is utterly different than what had gone before it takes time for people to adapt to dealing with the new reality.  This is part of what the enemy counts on.

And on the morning of 9/11 it worked for them until the passengers on United 93 got information about the previous crashes.  Because the flight was delayed in its departure and because the terrorists took just a bit longer to attack the cockpit, the passengers were able to hear from their loved ones about the twin towers and even the Pentagon.  They were able to organize an attack.  The movie asserts that they were trying to re-take the plane, which makes complete sense.  And it asserts that they got into the cockpit.  This is much more satisfying than believing they did not.  From what I have read about the comments of those that have heard the tapes, the entry into the cockpit is not certain.  However, it is certain that the plane went down or was taken down in response to the attack by the passengers.  And every passenger on that plane who took part in the attempted re-capture or supported it deserves to be honored.

Some might find the lack of backstory or the lack of explanation of what is happening moment by moment a bit disconcerting.  However, I found that it heightened the sense of reality for me.  Most of us have read enough or seen other specials on what happened on that plane that the broad story is well known.  It is nice to see a dramatic re-creation that sounds and looks more like reality than treating it as a kind of standard air-disaster story.

2546759,5,B000EYJHDS,"This is by far the best film on the foiled attempt to fly United Flight 93 into the Capitol or the White House on 9/11. In my opinion it is much better than the later Hollywood version entitled ""United 93."" Made for TV earlier this year, ""Flight 93"" was a powerful, gripping movie that fully engaged the viewers emotions. By focusing on the individual passangers and heroes of Flight 93 it made the viewer empathize with the actual people who acted with such courage and died in the attempt to foil the highjackers. The calls from the plane to loved ones on the ground were heart wrenching. I don't usually cry at movies, but I did while watching this one.

By contrast ""United 93"" -- while an exciting, hold onto your seat reenactment of the event -- was, for the most part, a typical Hollywood chase movie. All of the people, so effectively portrayed in ""Flight 93,"" were anonymous in this version. The viewer learned nothing about them -- not even there names. (It seems to me that an anonymous hero is a contrdiction in terms.) Consequently the movie failed to engage one's emotions, except for a feeling of horror at the enormity of the terrorist's deeds. One felt little empathy for the actual real lfe passangers of Flight 93, because we did not get to know them as individuals.

Instead the movie focused on the chaos of the situation both on the plane and on the ground, and on the chaotic attempts to get control of the situation by the air traffic controllers and, to a lesser extent, by the military. From time to time one got the sense that, in the usual Hollywood fashion, the film makers saw these people, caught up in a truly impossible situation, as, in some undefined way, incompetent.

In the end Hollywood drew on its usual resources and made another airplane highjacking/pursuit movie. A good one, but not a great one. Hollywood's problem is that it is so rarely able to transcend itself. It did not do so here.",1158019200,5,1932,4.578034682080925
2546760,5,B000EYJHDS,"I rented this movie by mistake thinking it was United 93 and I'm glad I did. This is a totally different movie experience nobody should miss. It seemed more like a documentry that took place exactly as it was happening. This is not your typical hollywood film that gets mixed up with well known actors/actress and special effects. About halfway through the movie, I had to sit down on the floor to watch, wanting to bit my finger nails. The movie Godsend w/Robert De Niro gave a creppy experience that I can't describe. This movie gives an experience much similar but in a different way. It really made me feel every emotion the passengers felt. Did I mention how realistic this movie was!?!?

2546761,4,B000EYJHDS,"This fine A&E reenactment of one slice of the confusing events of September 11, 2001 succeeds in showing the combination of ad hoc citizen response and highly professional management that greeted the high-speed unfolding of those incomprehensible events.

The grippingly eerie music of the soundtrack frames the portraits of normalcy that open the film. Early on, we are shown the names of many of Flight 93's passengers when the camera focuses on the processing of their boarding passes by a Newark flight agent. From then on, we see them as real people who find themselves the protagonists of a seemingly unreal attack.

When it becomes clear that Flight 93 is 'obviously not planning on landing', the passengers - with the encouragement or acquiescence of grieving family on the ground - do what they have to do to 'regain control of the plane'.

Flight 93 suggests the possibility that orders were given - or would soon have been given - to take the flight down as it made its erratic way towards Washington. This reviewer - a frequent flyer - applauds discussion of this possibility and believes such action should be taken in the event we again find ourselves in this predicament.

Flight 93 is not an easy film to watch. Yet it is salutary to do so, for a moment to imagine the terror experienced by civilians caught in a war in the airspace above a peaceful land, to see that evil *and* fear coexist in the eyes of the people who do such things, and to remember that sometimes the most dire of circumstances squeeze heroism to the surface of quite ordinary lives.",1157846400,27,1571,4.7226277372262775

This film is much more than entertainment.  It is healing and should be seen by every American.",1157328000,8,397,4.535211267605634
2546763,3,B000EYJHDS,"I might as well get this out of the way right away. ""United 93"" was my favorite film of this year thus far. Its ability to turn this event into a stunning, gut-wrenching, real experience had me leaving the theater giddy with excitement for the medium of film. Now I take on the made-for-TV version, ""Flight 93,"" which came out mere weeks before the theatrical version. Of course my expectations were fairly low, so when I didn't like it I wasn't terribly disappointed. That said this film does come screaming out of the gate, and had it been a 60 minute film as opposed to a 90 minute one I probably would have recommended it. But it is not to be as ""Flight 93"" runs out of gas, and then tries to coast across the finish line by playing into the sensibilities of their A&E audience.

The mastery Paul Greenglass had of his documentary feel in ""United 93"" isn't entirely clear until you see this film. The difference is in the details, which is exactly what ""Flight 93"" lacks. We don't see the mundane events of the air traffic control room before the attack, we don't see the terrorists agonizing over their timing, and we don't see the passengers debate how to land the plane (I hope it came up). Also, the actors move about the screen as though they were on a soundstage as opposed to a hijacked airplane. The head of the acting class here is Jeffrey Nordling who plays Tom. He actually uses facial expressions and voice inflections. The rest of the gang just wanders around as though they were auditioning for a spot on ""All My Children."" The film did, of course, get to me on some emotional level. The scenes early on of the airport the morning of gave me, who hates flying, the willies because of its sense of normalcy. This isn't a bad movie. It's an OK movie that has piggybacked itself onto a great human story.

I would also point out that if we are even going to truly explore the emotional depths this story has to offer we are going to have to shed this hero worship skin we now have. Peter Markle, the director, uses every short handed trick in the book to tell us that these people were good Americans. Nearly every one of them had rugrats running around at home to enhance their good guy street cred. A fatal blow came late in the film when they decided to throw the Fox News audience some love with an extended prayer scene between Todd Beamer and his new found phone friend. We already understand that these are the good guys; still there is not a vice to be found amongst them. On 9-11 these people were clearly the good guys, no matter who they were. In ""Road to Guantanamo"" the US soldiers were clearly the bad guys, but Michael Winterbottom was smart enough to show his victims as flawed and not too bright. But remember, we hate nuance here in America. Markle takes every precaution to make sure his audience is not offended. At the same time I'm sure A&E thought they were redefining the made-for-TV movie. OK, it's better than most, but it's also a whole lot of recycled trash. ***",1157241600,6,3005,4.432188065099457
2546764,5,B000EYJHDS,I don't cry watching movies often but seeing these hostage passingers saying goodbye to the loved ones on their cellphones was heartbreaking.

2546765,5,B000EYJHDS,"The television movie ""Flight 93"" made it on to the air before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/United-93/dp/B000GH3CR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""United 93""</a>&nbsp;was released in theaters, but I never thought of there as being a competition between the two.  Large historical events lend themselves to more than one telling and with these too films and ""World Trade Center"" we are only beginning to see dramatizations of September 11th.  It is not surprising that the first couple of films would be about this particular flight, because it was the first instance of fighting back on what is now being called the War on Terrorism, but which may well end up being something even larger in history's eyes.

Because the drama is happening aboard the plane and in the homes of those in touch with their loved ones by cell phone, ""Flight 93"" works on the intimacy of the small screen.  Peter Markle (""Faith of My Fathers"") and screenwriter Nevin Schreiner are limited by what little is publicly known about what happened on that flight.  Consequently, there is no attempt to fill in the gaps and smooth out the rough spots in the narrative.  When the passengers get together and talk about what should be done is the parts of the story that fascinates me the most, and there is relatively little of that in the film, but that is because there are only bits and pieces of it in the record of those events.  That is why there is so little about the four hijackers as well, because with few exceptions what they said in the cockpit is not known.

The cast is comprised almost exclusively of unfamiliar faces to my eye, with Jeffrey Nordling (from ""Once and Again"") the only one I immediately recognized.  Not these are all new faces, but that they are mostly ones that we have seen in minor roles in dozens of different television shows.  Of course this helps reinforce the idea that these were ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  Actually, the ones that impressed me most in this telling of that day were the family members, who were urging those on the plane to take action, supporting their decision, and simply offering words of comfort.  This is the side of the story that is somewhat new, the rest having received considerably more coverage, and these scenes have power because we find ourselves imagining, perhaps for the first time, being in their position.

Once the plane goes down this 2006 made for television movie loses its bearings a bit.  There is an inane comment by some suit investigating the crash and they suddenly turn up the music on the soundtrack.  Then there is the passage of the seasons, which I was expecting to end with the memorial to the passengers and crew of United 93, but that becomes the purpose of the final scroll before the end credits.  This underscores that of the four hijacked planes on 9/11, this was the one that did not hit its target, which is presumed to be either the White House or the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., and then we see the names of everybody on board.  However, these failings at the end are slight and do not detract from how riveting this film is, especially without the commercial interruptions.

At the end of this film when they talk about the intended target of United 93 I found myself thinking that American Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon, was probably supposed to hit either the White House or the Capitol, with United 93 hitting the other.  Given all of the care the terrorist took in targeting the World Center, with the goal of bringing down the towers, hitting one side of the Pentagon is nowhere close to the same level.  So I am inclined to think that the terrorists on Flight 77 missed their target.  This might seem a small thing, but it would mean that when the people on Flight 93 made the terrorists crash the plane well short of Washington, D.C., they ended up missing half of their intended targets.",1156896000,5,3955,4.8124076809453475
2546766,5,B000EYJHDS,"On a bright September morning in 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by Arab terrorists.  Three of them were deliberately crashed into buildings; two into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon.  The fourth airliner, United Airlines flight 93, was also scheduled to be flown into a building, possibly the White House or the Capitol building, but the heroic passengers aboard this flight fought back against the terrorists. Despite knowing that they were all going to die, these brave people banded together and managed to thwart the efforts of the terrorists.

The movie is shown through the eyes of the passengers of flight 93.  Their flight begins normally, but once airborne, four Arab terrorists, who claim to have a bomb, succeed in breaking into the cockpit and taking control of the aircraft.  The plane, originally bound for San Francisco, is turned around and is now heading east.  The terrorists, armed whitn box cutters, have already killed one of the passengers and wounded several others.  Some of the passengers, including Tom Burnett (Jeffrey Nordling) have begun making cell phone calls to their loved ones.  It is during one of these that Burnett learns from his wife that the World Trade Center has been struck.  Tom deduces that his plane is also intended to be used as a suicide plane to be flown into another building.

Some of the other passengers, including Mark Bingham (Ty Olsson), Todd Beamer (Brennan Elliott), and Jeremy Glick (Colin Glazer) develop a plan to charge the cockpit and overthrow the terrorists.  In the meantime, Todd Beamer has called the Verizon center.  The call is answered by Lisa Jefferson (Monnae Michaell).  The conversation that transpires between the two strangers is both poignant and frightening, as Lisa is able to hear everything that is happening on the plane.  Todd finally asks Lisa to recite the Lord's Prayer with him.  Afterward, Todd utters the words that have become so famous to many; ""Let's Roll"".

Despite their heroic efforts, flight 93 crashed in a rural area in Pennsylvania, just 20 minutes away from the nation's capitol.  The actions of these valiant passengers likely prevented the plane from reaching its intended target, widely thought to be the White House or the Capitol Building.

This excellent movie is a fitting tribute to those heroic passengers aboard flight 93.  The acting is very good, and the story is retold with complete historical accuracy.  Ty Olsson, Brennan Elliott, Colin Glazer, Jeffrey Nordling, Laura Mennell (Elizabeth Wainio), and April Telek (Lyz Glick) all give powerful and moving performances as the passengers and loved ones of flight 93. Also included in the film are actual communications between the passengers and their loved ones on the ground.

I highly recommend this heartbreaking and true story.  Despite the numerous casualties suffered during the attacks of September 11, 2001, the toll would have undoubtedly been much higher if not for the efforts of these brave and unselfish people.  This movie serves as a glowing tribute to those aboard the plane and their loved ones.  Their selfless sacrifice will never be forgotten.",1156118400,19,3161,5.116959064327485
2546767,4,B000EYJHDS,"A previous and obviously disliked review about the movie mentioned it being government propaganda. I can't say I agree with that but I will side with him and say it leaves out a lot of reality.

I thought it was a beautifully emotional movie. Note that I said ""movie"" not documentary or reenactment. Very little of this movie is factual. For example, why didn't they include the Presidential order to 'take them out' if needed? (That's fact according to Cheney on ""Meet the Press"")

I firmly believe anyone on that plane was a hero, whether they did anything or not. And while I liked the movie, I feel anyone creating a film and associating it with the events of that day should at least include ""some"" of the facts. But perhaps truth doesn't always make for a good movie? Let's see...

For example, two military jets are sent to intercept and the film (and official stories) lead us to believe they never made contact prior to the crash. That's impossible. Even if we ignore the fact that F-16's have a cruising speed of about 600 MPH and were less than 20 minutes away from the crash site, and we ignore knowing that Flight 93 was `suspicious' at least 30 minutes prior (likely more) to the crash, how can we ignore News outlets interviewing witnesses and reported stories of other aircraft pursuing 93 before the crash. If you happened to catch them, you were lucky, because most were never repeated. A Nashua Air Traffic Controller was even quoted as saying they watched an F-16 pursue 93, but that story didn't have much life either. And if we ignore all of that, how do we explain a debris field spread up to 8-miles from the actual crash site (which was a crater meaning it went in at a close to vertical angle and couldn't have possibly scattered debris that far from impact).

This is very much a Hollywood rendition of a tragic tale with a lot of unanswered questions about what really happened and/or how. It's a very heart-tugging fable and outside of a few 'cheesy' lines and unrealistic moments, it's extremely well done for entertainment purposes. It will make you feel for the families who lost loved ones and make you wonder how it felt to be sitting in one of those seats. Unfortunately, it's just a fable, and I feel the people who lost their lives deserve having their real story told - whatever it may actually be.",1156032000,6,2336,4.58133971291866
2546768,5,B000EYJHDS,"This seems to be the year of the 911 tribute films, and this made for A & E movie does a good job of telling the tragic and heroic story of United Airlines Flight 93 from the perspective of the fated passengers. The movie begins with scenes of passengers bidding fond farewells to their loved ones as they leave for the Newark Airport. Then the film shows each passenger's boarding ticket up close as they hand it over to the keeper of the flight gate.

The film then shows how the hijackers went one at a time to the airplane restrooms to prepare for their attack on the flight attendants.

They start by taking over first class, then they eventually move the passengers to the back of the plane. You get inside the huddle as passengers debate hpw they are going to take over the plane. You get to see the poignant phone calls that frightened passengers make to their tearful loved ones. Then you get to see the passengers carry out their heroic effort to reclaim control of the plane.

The movie lacks the spectacular graphics and the presence of top shelf actors and actresses that one might expect of a higher budget film. But everyone does a wonderful job, and I was especially impressed with the actress who played the Verizon operator who spoke with Todd Beamer. It was especially touching to see them pray the Lord's Prayer together.

This film may not win any awards, but it is an important documentary of the 4th hijacked place, and it is a fitting tribute to the passengers and flight crew of United Flight 93.",1155772800,8,1521,4.52

Writers, director and producers did an incredible job of piecing together the taped phone conversations and interviews with family members, forming a riveting portrayal of the courageous crew and passengers who decided to take matters into their own hands.  They knew they were going to die anyway, so they refused to let the hi-jackers reach their intended target, which was probably the White House.  I was particularly touched by the passenger who asked his support person on the other end of the line to pray the Lord's Prayer with him.

2546770,5,B000EYJHDS,"I have watched this movie at least 10 times and when compared to its motion picture counterpart ""United 93"" (directed by Oliver Stone), I prefer this version hands down.

I know that television movies have a reputation for being far less accurate and exciting than theatre versions, but this movie breaks the mold in a very big way. There is no fluff (as there is in ""United 93""), just good, solid performances.

The dialogue appears to be amazingly accurate. I read that it was drawn from personal interviews with family members and public records.  The acting is SUPERB; very emotionally charged and downright riveting. Most of the actors are unknowns, which probably adds to the realism. (FYI- the actor who plays First Officer Leroy Homer plays the same role in ""United 93"").  My only complaint is that some of the actors did not physically resemble their real-life counterparts, not by a long-shot...but nevertheless, their performances were phenomenal. I was amazed at how good they were.

As I mentioned in my ""United 93"" review, this all boils down to a matter of taste. Flight 93 focuses more on what happened on the plane with the passengers, crew and hijackers. United 93 focuses more on what happened on the ground between the different air traffic control operations and the military (which, by the way, is an excellent look at the inner workings of air traffic control and the miltary's confusion over the rules of engagement). One takes on a more technical viewpoint and the other a more personal one. The television version is of course a bit milder, but it still shines. Personally, I plan on owning both because their focus is so different.

Enjoy.

I watched with hands shaking at first, and then got caught up in the story--how people called loved ones to say good-bye, how one passenger called his wife to talk through what should be done, how terrified and inept the hijackers actually were. No theatrics, no flaming plane, little violence--just ordinary people caught in the most extraordinary of situations.

2546772,2,B000EYJHDS,"Flight 93, to me, is a poorly executed movie. After the plane is hijacked we are shown numerous phone calls by the passengers and that is all that happens until the plane finally crashes. Now I'm not saying the phone calls are inaccurate, but rather I felt that it slowed the story. After the first few phone call scenes my heart went out to all the families who lost a loved one on that flight. However, these are essentially repeated over and over and over again making me think okay I get it, I know it was hard for the families. The other problem I had was when the passengers try to take back the plane. First of all, the ""Let's Roll"" line is presented in a very hollywood like battle cry and secondly as the passengers are trying to get to the cockpit the movie keeps cutting to the outside of the plane as it is going down, again in a very hollywood manner. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, I really didn't get a sense of what it was like to be on that flight and having seen the film ""United 93"" there is no comparison. Facts like the plane being delayed before take-off for 45 minutes is not here, but are in ""United 93"". That delay gave the passengers much needed time react. That is one of many examples of why ""United 93"" is a far superior film then A&E's ""Flight 93"".  For me, this film seemed more hollywood the historical.",1152489600,4,1342,4.221789883268483

2546777,5,B000EYJHDS,"9/11 is a date that needs no explaining to anyone old enough to understand what was going on that day. Four planes were hijacked on the East Coast of the USA and with those hijackings thousands of lives were lost and millions more lives changed forever. In the weeks and months after 9/11 details began to emerge of the heroes of 9/11. Fourty-four of those heroes were on United Flight 93 and this film is their story.

Apart from the news reports the only other sound in my living room on the evening of 9/11 was of me pulling another tissue from the box. That was a sound that was repeated while watching Flight 93. This is a story that had to be told but watching it was like being back on that fateful day, reliving the horror all over again.

The passengers on board United Flight 93 watched in horror as their plane was hijacked. Several passengers phoned their loved ones to tell then what was happening only to hear that there were other hijackings happening along the East Coast and those planes were being slammed into buildings. Determined not to go down without a fight the passengers decided to try to take back control of the plane.

It was harrowing to watch the passengers of United 93 talking to their loved ones and saying goodbye. Tears streamed down my face as my heart broke for the courage those people showed in a time of such horror.

This was a wonderful dedication to the courage of the passengers aboard Flight 93 and one which should be watched by everyone to remind us of what real heroes look like.",1149984000,4,1528,4.465949820788531

2546779,5,B000EYJHDS,"About a year after September 11, an oft-repeated question was often asked: ""where were you when you heard?"". Me personally, I was at school, in the hallways when I heard a girl saying ""they bombed the Pentagon!"" but she said it an unserious tone. Having a spare I walked home and there it was all over news websites, clicked on CNN and there it was too. I'm not one of those guys that thinks making a serious movie about an event is ""too early"". I seem to remember a JonBenet Ramsey movie somewhere, an Elian Gonzalez, the Bird flu film recently and most likely they'll be a Natalee Holloway sometime too. This is the tv movie, not the recently released film in theatres, United 93 but this one is good too.

We all know the story: on September 11th 2001 early in the morning, 2 planes crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, another hitting the Pentagon. Well there was a 4th plane that oddly didn't get as much attention that crashed in the fields, not reaching its intended target. This film tells the story of those onboard and the dilemna of trying to survive so you can go back to your family again and the realization that you won't get to.

I'll admit the film got to me at times. I didn't outright break down but it sure can sober you up if you're feeling goofy. Part of this is the un-Hollywood style of the scenes. Yeah there's a scene of the passengers trying to take control of the plane but it's not done in that kind of ""I'm an ex-CIA agent and I'm quite capable of doing this stuff"". These are ordinary human beings who tried to see their families again, not a bunch of Macgyver action heroes.

Now I do got a personal gripe with 9/11 and that's actually the coverage. Yes each plane suffered a massive loss of life, including those at ground zero in the tower and the firefighters who went in. Seeing the plane crash into one of the towers, thereby ending many lives in one second is quite much but then good ol' CNN shows it every 7 seconds from different angles. In a weird way, it becomes less shocking since it became so familiar but seeing this film puts it in a more personal perspective.

Some will likely look to the theatrical film United 93 for the better one but this one is just as good.",1148342400,4,2232,4.345323741007194

2546781,5,B000EYJHDS,"My wife and I bought this video today and were absolutely glued to the screen.  If this doesn't make you choke up, you better check your pulse.  The movie was done in what I thought was very thoughtful for the families that had loved ones and friends onboard the plane, but it was very much able to get the feelings across.  They were all heroes, I'm glad the movie complemented them.  Don't look for the usual Hollywood drama and heroic scenes, these were ordinary people that got caught up in a situation they had no control over and did everything they could to help themselves and the others with them.  These are the real heroes we look for.",1147910400,4,646,4.440677966101695
2546782,5,B000EYJHDS,"Originally aired on the A&E Network, FLIGHT 93 is an extremely touching and valiant recreation of the tragedy that occurred on 9/11.

Bolstered by a cast of relative unknowns, the realistic depiction is gutwrenching and poignant.  Director Peter Markle and screenwriter Nevin Schrieber avoid manipulative exploitation, instead giving us real people caught in the worse possible scenario.  All of the performances are top notch, and while I haven't seen the theatrical UNITED 93, this is a very good movie.",1147305600,5,505,5.367088607594937
2546783,1,B000EYJHDS,"We didn't even watch, rent or buy this movie as there were no subtitles or closed captions for the ""Hearing Impaired"". However, can you believe there were Spanish subtitles? So, what is the USA coming to when their own handicapped people are being ignored? Pretty sad!!",1147132800,11,269,4.869565217391305
2546784,5,B000EYJHDS,"i didn't cry or shed tears during watching, but i was emotionally drained. i don't know if this film would do any good to those who lost their loved ones, but somehow i know that certain catharsis might do some good to them if they watched it. if three of the four hijacked airplanes could hit what those terrorists wanted to hit and only flt. 93 didn't and failed, we don't have to be too smart to realize that some great and valiant passengers indeed did some amazing thing to make those bastards fail in the end. this is a very sad movie but i didn't cry or shed tears, i was too shocked on that day when the twin towers were hit by hijacked planes. i knew i have been emotionally drained since that day, and also understood that our way of thinking and the way to look at the world were both totally changed since 9/11. and i'll forever personally hold the kingdom of saudi arabia (the greenhouse to grow terrorism and terrorists) responsible for what happened on that day and all the days after.",1147046400,4,1000,4.352941176470588
2546785,5,B000EYJHDS,"This movie is excellant for the people that say it was to early to make a film about this are very wrong. I couldn't believe how much I was actually had forgot about this day in history until I watched this movie and it all started coming back. I think this movie is very well done you can tell by events in the movie that some events during that flight were probably pretty gory, but they don't portray that in the movie much and that is good because it is not what this movie is about. The movie will take you through the phone calls home of the people involved and if they wouldn't done those calls we wouldn't ever known exactly how they took the plane over I think it very inspirational and sad, but everyone who felt 9/11/01 should watch this movie all the events you heard of that went on happen in this movie like I said it is excellant and I don't want to give any details of what go on that could ruin the movie for people.",1146960000,2,933,4.131868131868132
