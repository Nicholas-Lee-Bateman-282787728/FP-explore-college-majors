My DVD has no extras and no choice of audio (I think it's 5.1?)

Celia is only on the first two songs:

With Celia Cruz:
Kimbala
Guantanamera

Without Celia:
En Orbita
El Raton
Me Gente
Guantanamera
Ponte Duro
Fania Theme/Closing credits

As part of the wacky festival organized in Kinshasa, Zaire for the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" fight between George Foreman and Mohammed Ali, Zaire's dictator organized a massive celebration of african sports and entertainment.  In addition to B.B. King and James Brown, this included the 'Fania All Stars' which was the cream of the crop of the salsa world circa 1974.  So thanks to a blatant misuse of public funds in a poor country, we now have some of the most amazing footage of Fania All Stars live in front of 80,000 people.  This video was directed by Leon Gast who recently won an Academy Award for ""When We Were Kings,"" a documentary of the Ali and the fight.  The dolby soundtrack is pretty darn good too.
If calling this a Celia Cruz video is deceitful advertising, the good news is that it includes several other stars of her stature.  Celia did perform a few songs, including the Cuban classic song Guantanamera--which is spelled with a 'G' not a 'Q'!--and a terrific rendition of her classic Kymbala.  But there is much more to this video.  Fania at that time amassed an impressive array of top musical talent.  Ray Barreto playing a gripping solo on the conga.  Johnny Pachecho spinning around the stage like a maniac, playing the flute.  Ismael Miranda soneando.  An awesome rendition of the salsa anthem 'Ponte Duro'.  Larry Harlow on the piano.
But the highlight, in my opinion, is Hctor Lavoy's awesome performance of ""Mi Gente.""  That, by itself, is well worth the cost of this video.  S mi pana, el mismito rey de la puntualidad, la voz, el incomparable, en vivo y a todo color.  Bestial.  This is a truly historic performance.",1003622400,15,1812,4.665615141955836
7881358,4,630502636X,"Es un video de 56 minutos que muestra 7 interpretaciones de la Fania en Zaire, (Cheo Feliciano con el ratn, Hctor Lavoe con Mi Gente, los cantantes de la Fania improvisando) en dos de ellas canta Celia Cruz, lstima que dure tan poquito pero en general es un video para tener en la coleccin... qeu viva La Fania y Hctor Lavoe!!",997660800,4,326,4.360655737704918
7881359,5,630502636X,"Its one of the best, this Celia Cruz performance in Africa with the fania all stars its what salsa lovers want, not too many people know about salsa and their best singers , but to let everyone know this group of musicians  were the top guys in the business and the chorus include the best salsa  singer ever ... HECTOR LAVOE, all of them enter to the fania by Willie  Colon and the great musician and composer (the producer of the fania)  Johnny Pacheco. For those who doesnt know about Celia Cruz , one of this  two guys found her performing in a bar and they need her to work a duo and  there she is , the Queen of salsa and the Kings , all these guys are  puertorricans except for Johnny and Celia , buy it so you can learn more  about the best times in salsa in Africa ...",952646400,8,777,4.065789473684211
7881360,1,630502636X,"So, you see this DVD title, and the title says,  ""CELIA CRUZ - Quantanamera"". What do you expect to see? A DVD of Celia performing, right? HA! There are 7 tracks on this DVD, and of those 7, Celia Cruz is  only on 2. TWO! Very Misleading! Whomever marketed this title should not  have been so deceptive, but rather call it what it is: A salsa musical  concert that features the talents of some of the Fania All Stars (with  Johnny Pacheco). Not only are Celia fans being deceived, but Johnny Pacheco  fans are missing out; looking at the title or front cover of this title,  you would never guess Johnny was on over three-fourths of this DVD. Celia  AS ALWAYS is flawless & gives a TERRIFIC performance with the 2 songs  she does sing. I should've known something was astray when Celia's  signature song, ""Guantanamera"" is misspelled in the title as  ""Quantanamera"".",947116800,11,866,4.594771241830065
