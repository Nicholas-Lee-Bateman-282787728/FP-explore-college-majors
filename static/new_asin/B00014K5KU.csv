1970246,2,B00014K5KU,"Laaawwwwdd, what was that I just watched. All that money Master P has and he has to release this low budget movie. The acting was atrocious to no end. Why don't Silkk the Shocker just give up on acting all together as long with his rap game.
The two stars were given because the story was good, but the acting just didn't do its justice.
I think Master P should know better!!!
Later!!!!",1088380800,5,386,4.301369863013699

1970254,5,B00014K5KU,"Good story - good acting - master p has released some pretty good films and some pretty bad ones.

This is one of the better dvds from p.

the music video at the end of the film ( we soldiers) is not on any album.

worth watching even if you are not a fan of master p.",1160784000,4,268,3.6666666666666665
1970255,1,B00014K5KU,"The first Bout It, for a low budget movie was outstanding and innovative. It was gritty and poignantly real. In the Still Bout It, I don't know what the H@*L they were doing. The movie was simply atrocious! I was so disappointed in the movie that I wanted to throw it out of a window. I am a big supporter of Master P and the No Limit family however, he needs to stick to music or come real next time on the movie tip. Don't waste your money!",1116979200,,442,4.034090909090909
1970256,5,B00014K5KU,"The least that can be said for Master P's ""Still Bout It"" is that this production is an overwhelming visual experience, supplemented by an imaginative use of all the divergent elements which go into filmmaking. The most that can be said for this MGM roadshow presentation in Cinerama, filmed in Super Panavision and Metrocolor, is that once again, as so rarely happens in film history, an individual talent -- Master P -- has widened and exalted the art of the film by his vision, dedication and uncompromising creative approach to the medium so often called the ""synthesis of all art forms.""

  ""Still Bout It"" is indeed beyond description by conventional plot terms and descriptive tradepaper summaries. As the past 10 or 12 years have shown, the old narratives which dominated the film world have given way to themes, techniques and concepts, once the private property of the avant-garde, the experimental films, etc. Whether ""Last Year at Marienbad"" or ""Trans-Europe-Express"" from France, or Roger Corman's ""The Trip"" or Kubrick's ""2001,"" from the U.S., the straightforward story has had it. And the audiences of today, primarily the under-30 group down to the early teens, have shown a great, almost revitalized, interest in movies as they are now being made.

  With Arthur C. Clarke's assistance, plus the cooperation of NASA and leading American and British experts in the field of space, science, research and the Academy, Master P was able to create a real science-fiction film, one in which every element will quite possibly be known to man in less than 30 years.",1114992000,3,1574,5.0346153846153845
1970257,1,B00014K5KU,"I like Master P and all, but, dude can't act! Silk The Shocker can't act! The only reason i gave it 1 star, is because the story was iight, and saying iight, is a stretch, but it was ok for a Master P movie. At times, it seemed they made this movie with a camcorder, i mean the acting was just horrible, i recommend you borrow this movie from someone who already has it, its not worth a dime, and i wouldnt pay a penny for it.",1101945600,4,426,3.9080459770114944
