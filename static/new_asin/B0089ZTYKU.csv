8526450,5,B0089ZTYKU,"If you want to see the spectacular Niagara Falls brilliantly photographed from every angle imaginable, in glorious high definition, then this Blu-ray disc is for you. The photographers have taken their cameras to all these spots in all seasons of the year and have put together a memorable film on the falls and surrounding area.
A wee bit of history has been thrown in documenting some of the daredevils (ie. idiots) who have walked above the river on highwires and those who have found it necessary to go over the falls.

Whether you have been to Niagara Falls or not, this film will either be a terrific momento of your visit or will give the armchair traveller a detailed look at what he is missing!

Beautifully produced and thoroughly recommended and being Region 0, it plays worldwide.",1344038400,7,792,4.773722627737226
