5564794,5,B00BA2W2GW,"We originally had the Cha Cha Cha CD and liked it so much we decided to try out the whole Whistlefritz collection. My son is two and loves the DVDs (and I really like them too). The DVDs are well done and not annoying like a lot of kids shows can be. We've watched the DVDs a few times each so far and are already picking up a lot of the basic words. I also really like that you can turn on the Spanish subtitles so you can see all the words as they're spoken. The songs on the CDs are quite cute and help reinforce the language used in the DVDs. If you want to start learning Spanish I think this is a great system to start with, it covers different rooms of the house, parts of the body, animals, seasons and lots and lots of other things. My son and I are both starting to learn Spanish and he asks to watch these DVDs over his other shows, it's a very fun way to learn another language. Overall a very great product.",1376352000,11,920,4.005434782608695
5564795,5,B00BA2W2GW,"I have two daughters, who are 4 & 6 years old.  My 6 year old will join a Spanish Immersion classroom in the fall, and I was looking for a way to introduce some Spanish and give her an idea of what class would be like.  It's hard to explain to a 6 year old that they really will understand what's going on, even if the teacher speaks another language.  The Whistlefritz DVDs are perfect!  Both of my girls are singing along to the songs, and are picking up a lot of vocabulary in a meaningful way.  I studied Spanish in college but am out of practice, and it's been a great refresher for me too.  My kids especially love Los Animales and La Fiesta de Fritzi, but all of the DVDs are engaging with great music and enough humor to keep them engaged.  There's a scene where they introduce some clothing and ask, ""Do I wear this on my head?"" (in Spanish, of course), and now we play that game with things we find around the house and it gives me the chance to introduce more vocabulary.

Maria's pronunciation is clear and easy to understand, while still being authentic.  Much better than them learning from their mom who has a terrible American accent!

I highly recommend this set for anyone who just wants to expose their children to another language, or anyone considering an immersion class for their kids.  Watch as a family, and you can learn Spanish together!  My daughter went from apprehensive to excited about her immersion class after watching the DVDs, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.",1369353600,27,1506,4.476190476190476
5564796,1,B00BA2W2GW,We've played two out of the five dvd's and they both skip. The kids really like it even though the movies are messed up. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone because of product being damaged.,1453248000,,191,4.485714285714286
5564797,5,B00BA2W2GW,Love these! My kids loved them. Native speakers! Well worth it!,1443830400,,63,4.818181818181818
5564798,5,B00BA2W2GW,Very useful in learning Spanish and currently the only thing my kids want to watch.,1440979200,,83,4.6
5564799,5,B00BA2W2GW,"I don't think my 2-year old will learn Spanish because of these videos but they do give her some good exposure to Spanish. She asks to watch them every day. The little mouse, Fritzi, gets her excited about the videos.

The language is slow enough for kids and adults to clearly hear what is being said even if you don't understand it. The important words are repeated often. There is enough singing and bright colors to also hold a child's attention.

Again, my daughter won't be learning Spanish from just these videos but she has started counting in Spanish and identifying some objects using Spanish vocabulary as well as English. I hope the repeated exposure from the videos help with my kid's Spanish accent and help her more comfortable with learning the language when we put her in a Spanish program in the near future.",1439856000,3,826,4.689655172413793
5564800,5,B00BA2W2GW,Amazong dvd set! We love it!!!,1437091200,,30,4.166666666666667
5564801,4,B00BA2W2GW,"These videos are beautiful, but they have a little problem in the sound. They do not work well in some beginning sentences.",1435017600,,123,4.636363636363637
5564802,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My 18 month old son has been watching these videos and listening to the CDS's since he was 6 months old.  He LOVES Fritzi, Maria, and all the children.  These videos are very educational for basic Spanish and very good at entertaining children. Actually, even I enjoy listening to the CDs...and I walk around daily singing the songs!",1433721600,,333,4.724137931034483
5564803,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My baby is 5 months and she really pays close attention to the videos, I really like them!",1425168000,,90,4.055555555555555
5564804,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My grandson loved this when I checked them out in our local library, so he just had to have them so he didn't have to give them back. Even his father liked watching them with him. Great for children of any age and some adults that are kids at heart!!",1424908800,,250,4.02
5564805,5,B00BA2W2GW,"This is one of the best Spanish teaching resources I've come across, and I used to teach elementary school Spanish classes in a public school! The immersion is actually effective because it has lots of repetition and is easy enough to guess what is going on. It is very entertaining, even though the frame rate and speed of the whole thing is much slower than most movies/shows these days, which makes me feel a lot better about putting my toddler in front of it. It's a lot like a very talented private tutor comes into the house and teaches my daughter while I am getting something done!

The only down sides to this series are things that a kid would never care about - just some pixilation problems with some of the pictures, and a little bit of out-of-tune singing (just one small song).  Most of it is very professional.  I still gave it 5 starts because, like I said, it's one of the best series I've come across for teaching Spanish in a long time!",1419897600,,956,4.420454545454546
5564806,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My 6 year olds actually enjoy watching the videos and listening to the songs.  I listen to the DVD's as I am driving.  Because I can't see the videos, I have to guess at what is being said.  Now after listening to the DVD's for a few months, I have learned some new words.

I would use these to complement Spanish lessons.  But not to replace lessons.",1408147200,4,351,4.17910447761194
5564807,5,B00BA2W2GW,"Cute songs, my daughter likes seeing all the kids. We use this and little pim but this is more true to the spanish my husband and I speak, little pim uses odd variations of words that sometimes really throw us off. Definitely good for an environment where there are spanish speakers so it works for us, that being said if no one in your house speaks spanish you may have a hard time.",1406764800,2,383,4.260273972602739
5564808,3,B00BA2W2GW,"Had high hopes for this from the great reviews, but my kids are not really enjoying this. They moan and groan every time I try to get them to watch these videos.",1402012800,,161,4.0625

5564810,5,B00BA2W2GW,"They're as cheesy as you'd expect them to be, but as a Spanish teacher, I find this is just perfect for teaching children a foreign language. Even though I teach Spanish, it is not my native language, so my son (age 3) speaks NO Spanish, but he just loves to sit and watch these videos; he laughs at all the right parts so he's obviously understanding enough of what is going on. These videos seem as if they were made on a low budget (they use a really strange mishmash of objects as visuals), but they do the trick and my son is definitely learning Spanish. He told me today ""this is my lengua"" as he stuck out his tongue. I have to admit that one feature I like on these videos is the ability to ""repeat play"" so he can watch the same episode back-to-back. I find this is a great way to reinforce the words and I kind of think he picks up new things each time he watches (and he surprisingly doesn't get bored of watching the same episode again and again). I really encourage parents to give this a try and don't be discouraged if YOU don't understand what's going on- your children are wired to figure it out a lot easier and faster than you are so even though you may think he or she is not understanding, you may actually be surprised to find they are.",1391212800,9,1258,4.202479338842975
5564811,5,B00BA2W2GW,"We recently moved our 2-year-old to daycare, which is great, except it means she no longer spends the day with her Spanish-speaking caregiver. We got this to at least try to keep a little Spanish in the house.  Our daughter loves it!  She especially loves the songs.  She claps during each song and at the end of each program she gives a little ""Yay"" and asks for ""mas"".  We often replay the songs.  A winner!",1384041600,2,409,4.4
5564812,4,B00BA2W2GW,"My 8 year old son enjoys the program, this was the first program we tried. Each DVD is less than 30 min, and all the songs from the DVDs are also on the CDs which you can take to your car or anywhere you go, to reinforce. It is also probably more appropriate for somewhat younger children (4-7), which is what they say on the description, but I bought it for variety and I am not disappointed. I like Susy Dorn's collection more, mainly because it has supplementary books with all the songs, vocabulary book with pictures and coloring books. makes for more interactive learning. I think if this program had a supplementary picture guide or an activity book it would be a 5 star.",1383782400,10,678,4.432
5564813,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My 18 month daughter can't get enough of this, and I am confident that this will help her learn and retain Spanish! :)",1380931200,,118,4.173913043478261
5564814,2,B00BA2W2GW,"As a foreign language teacher, the approach is entertaining but for teaching a language to a child it's just plain ineffective. Initially I was super excited about this product but after using it for a while the children no longer want to watch and aren't repeating any of the words. If you want a cute video that you can use to sit your child in front of while you go about your day this could work, although I think it's too expensive for that. The videos jump right into conversational Spanish and that works great in a true immersion environment such as the child's home but for a passive medium such as video, there needs to be more of a focus on words that then build into phrases. Otherwise, children are either lost or just passively watching. It's cute, but the approach they took means ultimately it's a waste of money :(",1380585600,34,831,4.473684210526316
5564815,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My 2 year old loves these Spanish-immersion videos. They have great songs and fun segments. The animation is basic but that doesn't detract much from the program. He now goes around saying, ""hola!"" and has learned spanish words for several fruits.",1378512000,,247,5.048780487804878

8564813,5,B00BA2W2GW,"These are super well done, super engaging, and I love that it seeks to teach language by immersion, which studies have shown is the most effective way of learning new languages. My daughter, in the beginning, was not thrilled.  I got an ear full from her on it, the kind that leaves blisters on the brain.  She wanted something that had the translations right in it so she didn't have to work as hard to understand what was going on.  But by the end of the first couple of weeks, she was a believer so to speak, and said she could see why these would be better.  Nearly passed out on the spot.

For me, I really liked having these, because as I am also the mama of a beautiful boy with significant disabilities, homeschooling her for a year was unlike anything I can describe.  I was happy to be able to provide her with that level of support when she needed it, as I would for any child of mine, and I certainly tried to do the very best I could with everything, but there were days where I definitely needed to dial in the Spanish portion, so to speak, and I found it super helpful to have these.  A life saver, actually.  I loved them.",1488240000,5,1138,4.211981566820277
8564814,5,B00BA2W2GW,"If you're hesitating, dont. I took spanish all through middle and high school and have already learned more with fritzy. My kids LOVE it!! It's actually the ONLY show my 18 month old will watch and she's already repeating words and using it In everyday language. My 5 y.o. really enjoys it as well and sings the songs around the house. Highly recommended!",1475193600,,355,4.650793650793651
8564815,5,B00BA2W2GW,"So this is immersion teaching! I've always thought it meant plunking someone down in a country a la survivor style and having to struggle to make sense of the culture and language. But I am impressed with how Whistlefritz executes immersion teaching! No spoken English but clearly enunciated Spanish in a pace that allows emphasis and intentional intonation delivered by someone with engaging facial expressions talking directly to the viewers (and feedback from on-screen kids). Also, effective repetition with imagery and demonstration and a fun atmosphere of songs and dances! My baby (20 months) doesn't sit through anything except the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and I was so happy that she is enjoying this program! She is dancing and singing along with the show! Great job to this company!",1469491200,2,792,5.1953125

8564817,5,B00BA2W2GW,"My 5-year-old granddaughter just can't get enough of these fun but instructional DVD's. I even have watched them with her several times without being bored and find myself learning a bit of Spanish! There is nothing particularly special about the music CD's included in the collection--they take the tunes from the DVD's and put them in CD format. But once the child has watched the DVD's, the CD's are good for playing in the car.",1464825600,2,431,4.76
