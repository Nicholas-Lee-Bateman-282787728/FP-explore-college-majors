1568409,4,B00005JPFT,"The main premise behind ""Shrek the Third"" begs the question of whether or not an ogre is fit to be a king. This is certainly an adequate premise. What isn't so adequate is the film's extreme jokiness. This isn't to say that the first two films weren't funny; indeed, both had many moments that made the audience laugh. However, they still managed to be fairy tales, with decent doses of genuine drama throughout. The same can't be said for this new film; it's much more of a comedy, filled with sight gags and one-liners that would only appeal to younger audiences (or at least to audiences who believe that a film's story is irrelevant). While I am recommending ""Shrek the Third"" for being light-hearted and pleasant to look at, you should know that it's not as good as 2001's ""Shrek"" and nowhere near as good as 2004's ""Shrek 2.""

Here's the plot: Shrek, our beloved green ogre (voiced by Mike Myers), is now an accepted member of the royal family. By law, this means that he's next in line for the throne; his father-in-law--the Frog King (John Cleese)--explains this on his deathbed (in a scene that was more comical than it should have been). Even though he and Shrek have long since buried the hatchet, Shrek makes it clear that he's not ready to be Far Far Away's next king. Such insecurity should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the first two films: his first struggle was his love for Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz); his second was getting the royal family to accept him as an ogre. This time around, he struggles not only with the possibility of being a ruler, but also with the reality that Fiona is pregnant.

Just before the King croaks (pun definitely intended), he tells Shrek of a second heir to the throne: Fiona's cousin, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), nicknamed Artie. Shrek--along with his faithful sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Bandaris)--immediately set sail to find him, only to discover a teenager that's picked on by everyone in high school (even the unpopular nerds are mean to him). Despite his eagerness to leave, Artie is just as reluctant to be the next ruler of Far Far Away as Shrek is. Needless to say, it's going to take a lot of convincing to get him to cooperate.

Meanwhile, things aren't looking so bright in Far Far Away; the arrogant Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has joined forces with every fairy tale villain imaginable, and they've taken control of the kingdom. Fiona, her mother (Julie Andrews), and a group of snobby fairy tale princesses have been captured and imprisoned. Thus is the reality of Charming's anger: he's been quite bitter since losing both his mother and Fiona's hand at the end of the previous film, and he clearly wants his revenge. It doesn't help that he's since been reduced to working as an actor in a rowdy dinner theater. Considering his flair for theatrics, I guess his plan to kill Shrek during a live stage show makes perfect sense. Or maybe it's just silly; I'm not exactly sure anymore.

What I am sure about is the extremely silly nature of the film as a whole. Consider a subplot with Merlin (Eric Idle), made to be incompetent for this story; one of his spells results in Donkey and Puss switching bodies. This proves troublesome later on in the film, when Puss tries to distract a group of guards with his signature cute expression (his eyes widen considerably, his ears droop, and he would innocently hold his hat). Donkey's face doesn't allow for any cuteness to emerge; ""Let's kill it!"" the guards shout before charging. And then there are the many supporting characters, such as Gingy the Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, and the Big Bad Wolf, all of which provided some comedy relief throughout the entire series. Unfortunately, they're less effective in this film because pretty much every character is comedic. There's no balance between comedy and drama anymore--it's a lopsided film that relies on entirely on its sense of humor. This wouldn't have been so bad had the first two films been the same way.

However, I was impressed by some of the comedic material. I'm directly referring to Shrek coming to terms with fatherhood; it's highlighted by a dream sequence in which hundreds of baby ogres invade his cottage. Such moments made ""Shrek the Third"" worth recommending, despite being an undeniably inferior film. At this point, my only concern is whether or not another ""Shrek"" film will hit theaters; if this trend of declining quality continues, I don't think I'll be able to recommend the fourth installment. I say this because there was just enough about this installment to recommend. While it's a triumph of computer generated technology, and while the film looks incredible, the story and the overactive sense of humor leave much to be desired.",1179446400,,4800,4.806295399515738
1568410,3,B00005JPFT,"Shrek the 3rd has Shrek avoiding being King of Far Far Away after the Frog King (John Cleese) dies. Most reviews knock the use of the song (Live and Let Die) being played during the King's funeral saying it doesn't work. But I thought the frogs singing the song was pretty funny and I heard people laughing too. So critics don't know much. Anyway, with the King dead Shrek seaks out a relative of Fiona who's next up to be King. It's a boy named Artie who's supposed to be a young Arthur. He's voiced by an unfunny and annoying Justin Timberlake. I tried to like him but the addition of him is pretty forgettable. When everyone is dancing at the end, I doubt anyone will even ask...where's Artie ?

  When Shrek is sailing away to find Artie Fiona tells him he's going to be a father. Which leads to a funny nightmare scene about what fatherhood will be like for him. While he's gone Prince Charming makes an army of fairytale villians to help him take over Far Far Away and become King. Fiona and other princesses are all that stand in his way when Shrek is gone.

  Shrek the 3rd has some good laughs although some you have to be an adult to understand why they are funny. It has some charm too but most of it comes at the very end. The movie is mostly about Shrek and Artie having to learn from each other. But still I didn't really care about Artie much. He's a whiney annoying kid and even when he's not whining he's annoying. So no way is he as good of an addition to the cast as Antonio Banderas was as Puss in Boots. Infact he has too many lines. I rather have more scenes with Puss and Boots and Donkey any day since they are actually...funny. The film has it's moments but it's still not as memorable as Shrek 1 and 2. If they're gonna make a part 4, then they really need a clever idea for it.",1179446400,2,1804,4.199421965317919
1568411,4,B00005JPFT,"In a summer of threequels (Spidey 3, Shrek 3, and Pirates 3), everyone's favorite green orge returns, complete with his true love, Fiona, and his sidekicks, Donkey and Puss in Boots.  The Shrek franchise is a popular series of films (and a definite money maker) and this film should continue that trend.  However, this film is not quite up to par with its predecessors.

The story begins in Far Far Away Land where Fiona's father dies, but not before asking Shrek to step into his royal shoes and rule the kingdom.  Shrek is none-to-happy to fulfill the dying wishes of his dead father-in-law and decides to seek out another heir to the throne who the dying monarch mentions before he croaks...pun intended!

With Shrek off on an adventure to find the heir, who turns out to be Arthur or ""Artie"" (King Arthur and played rather dimly by Justin Timberlake), the scheming Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) returns with an army of fairy tale villains determined to steal the throne and banish his green rival once and for all.

The story this time around seems to take a little longer to get rolling and doesn't quite have the charm of the first two films.  The film does have its moments and I did love the fact that this movie empowers the fairy tale heroines (played by the wickedly talented, Mya Rudolph, Amy Sedaris, Cheri Oteri and Amy Pohler) who are normally relegated to being saved by a handsome and heroic prince.  This time the girls including Cinderella, Snow White, Sleepy Beauty and Fiona rush to the rescue of the men and give the twisted fairy tale a ""girl power"" makeover!  Another charming aspect of the film is that we get to see Shrek as a daddy, which provides an upbeat and endearing ending to the film.  One thing that did bother me a little is Donkey and Puss switching bodies after a magic spell goes wrong.  It was a funny bit but after a while it was a little disconcerting to hear the voice of Antonio Banderas coming out of donkey's mouth and Eddie Murphy's coming out of Puss' mouth.  And, as far as Timberlake voicing Arthur, I wasn't all that impressed.  If he were replaced in the fourth film, it really wouldn't bother me at all.

But if you are a Shrek fan, I think you will enjoy the film.  It does have some funny moments and the animation, as usual, is beautiful.  A good addition to the Shrek franchise.",1179446400,3,2338,4.544152744630072
1568412,2,B00005JPFT,"I got out of classes this fine Friday for some special school occasion, so the entire middle school went over to the movie theater to see Shrek The Third at a discovered matine showtime at the local theater. A week ago, when the faculty first announced we'd be seeing this instead of Spider-Man 3, I was pretty excited. I mean, come on, it's Shrek--you really can't go wrong with the charming, funny, brainy-as-hell movies coming out of Dreamworks, with voice talent by Eddie Murphey, Mike Myers, and Cameron Diaz...right? Wrong. Let's start by examining what Shrek The Third DIDN'T have. The first ""Shrek"" was loved by me--and pretty much every other Shrek fan who is mature enough to understand its witty humour, special heartwarming touch, and its meant-for-adults-that-goes-way-over-little-kids'-heads type content. The filmmakers of the first Shrek really had some awesome material up their sleeves--stuff that truly made a fantastic movie, and if I do say so myself, one of the best animated films ever to be pumped out of LA.

The second Shrek, ""Shrek 2,"" was a slight decline in entertainment. It was still funny, and still had half a tank of movie magic gasoline--not a full tank like the first Shrek possessed, but half--good enough to make a decent and enjoyable film, but not nearly enough to quite match up to the original.

And now, sure enough, as every successful movie must have, a second sequel. ""Shrek The Third"" is a complete and utter mess. Remember those special little tricks the filmmakers had up their sleeves for the first Shrek, and even some for the second Shrek? Well, they're all GONE--not missing, no, they're completely GONE. What made the first two movies enjoyable for me had completely been used up, proving to us moviegoers and critics that sequels to big blockbusters are gigantic wastes of money.

Sure, it was FUNNY. It was really funny, I laughed a lot. But where was the brain behind the comedy? Where was the backbone, the spine, the rock where instead of St. Peter builds the Church, where the filmmaker is supposed to base the movie on, where was that? It wasn't there--it was like the filmmakers pretended it was there, when it really wasn't, and just ignored that fact and continued to make the movie with no worries. A ""ghost comedy"" I like to call it. Now I know what you're asking yourself--how could I enjoy a ""ghost comedy"" like ""Anchorman,"" but not this? Well, this leaves me into my next point.

The direction of the movie was an embarrassingly bad joke. It was like the director was sitting back smoking bongs and drinking Guinness while the sound editors filled in for him. The story didn't flow like the first two, it wasn't interesting, and after a while, I just got bored with the whole thing and started thinking about other, more important aspects of my life. The storyline felt like the film caterer used a knife to chop up it into little bits of segments and then mixed them around, making the movie almost as pointless as ""Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector."" A stupid comedy that is directed well can be a VERY FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE FILM. But when it's not? The essence of the film drains away to leave just empty-hearted and hollow laughs that don't mean anything.

AND THE ENDING! OH GOD, THE ENDING! What were they thinking?! I was pretty much asleep! They tried to make it funny and give the audience the warm fuzzy feeling they felt in the first two movies, and they failed miserably! It was almost like they tried to justify the crappiness of the rest of the movie with a satisfying finale, and ended up doing the opposite and making the rest of the movie even crappier than it was. Which is truly saying something.

Overall, ""Shrek The Third"" got me out of class, and that really was the only good part about seeing it. A huge, and unfortunate, disappointment. Save your money and rent the first two. I hope there's no ""Shrek The Fourth.""",1179446400,14,3910,4.725806451612903
1568483,1,B00005JPFT,"Sharon, I know youll see this because you read all reviews for Shrek the Third. Its so hard for me to do this, and Im struggling to find the words to say what Im thinking. Things between us just haven't been the same ever since you stopped working at Burger King. I know we said that wouldnt come between us, but it has. Our love has been stale since that day. How could you choose Wendys fresh-never-frozen patties over the love we shared while we were working at BK?? We have to end things. Im sorry, Sharon. I didn't want it to end like this, but you leave me with no choice. Goodbye, Sharon.

I love the Shrek series, and I'm a grown adult now, but I loved them as teens too, and I see no reason why mature children could not see this movie. The plot is, of course, a daring rescue! What better inspiration for a daring quest than love in peril?
The humor and hysterical parallels between the real world and Fairy Tale World are downright hilarious at times, and exceeding accurate!

But despite the silliness these movies have an amazing amount of heart. And they really do try to show that doing the right thing makes you the right person. Not the right things or title or looks. For an animated series it's one of my favorites. I recommend it to anyone or any age group.

Too much subverting and reversing said tropes when they were referenced.  The movie was one big badly written attempt at satire every single second until there was no story of its own left.  In the end, the movie was buried under the weight of each line trying to be some sarcastic or humorous reference to something else.  And who was voicing Puss in Boots?  The same guy?!?  He was boring as heck now.  Such a big buildup of the high school with Lancelot, Guenevere and Merlin featured and then they were left on a bus and we never heard from them again.  Arthur's character was totally uninteresting.

1569524,3,B00005JPFT,"Shrek the Third is a difficult movie to enjoy if you have high expectations. Its not quite the same movie as Shrek or Shrek 2. That is to say, it is a very different kind of movie that doesnt have the same heart or passion behind it. But having seen it a number of times, it really isn't too bad.

Shrek, to me, is a series about a misunderstood Ogre who falls in love with a princess and lives ugly-ever-after. Its a satire of childhood fairy tales with tons of crude humor that appeal to children and adults. But we love Shrek because his story is one about true love; a love that goes deeper than any Disney movie has ever done. Its this unusual twist on fairy tales that entertains us and makes us relate to the very original and very relatable characters.

But Shrek the Third is where the romance ends, as theres no conflicts left to come in between Shrek and his love for Princess Fiona. Having said that, I confess Im not totally disappointed with the setup of this movie and its story. The plot line starts with the death of King Harold (Fionas father). When Shrek and Fiona realize they are the next in line to inherit the throne Shrek begins to panic until he realizes there might be another heir who will rule Far Far Away better than he will. So Shrek beings his quest to find this next heir, the young teenage Arthur, but it suddenly takes a turn for the worst when he discovers Fiona has become pregnant and he is going to be a father.

First and foremost, I believe its genuinely good that Dreamworks took the story of Shrek and Fiona in such a bold direction, as most movies about romance do not develop couples past marriage and into parenthood. However, seeing as Shrek and Fiona are separated for most of the movie, the love story between them is non-existent. In fact, some of the supporting characters argue that children will make Shrek and Fiona slip away from each other, and others believe children will instead strengthen their love. If this had been the focus of the movie I believe Shrek the Third would have stayed true to the essence of the series which centered on romance and true love. However, the emotional conflict focuses instead on Shreks fear of fatherhood and tells a story thats less than it could have been.

Another part of the story that I also didn't like is Prince Charmings return. Somewhere in between the events of Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third, this pitiful character we already know has become the most unpopular man alive. So unpopular, in fact, that hes not even welcome at a tavern full of fellow villains and I cant help but feel sorry for him, as unbelievable as it sounds. Im not entirely sure how bad a person Prince Charming is to warrant this treatment, but he somehow sweet talks his fellow villains into joining him and conquering the kingdom of Far Far Away. Provided, this is an interesting setup, but Prince Charming comes across as a very whiny and selfish villain, and not quite as threatening or menacing as the previous villains Shrek has faced.

Without sounding like a fanboy who pretends to know better than the movie makers, I really don't care for the emotionally touching moments of Shrek the Third. We already know that the conflict doesnt put Shrek and Fionas love for each other in jeopardy. But there are some scenes that are downright distasteful, like when King Harold is on his deathbed and the screenwriters are trying to make us laugh while a beloved character keels over and DIES! Emotional moments like that tend to be sacrificed for jokes which are not always funny or well-paced.

However, I must confess that not all the jokes are bad. Most of Shrek the Third is actually quite clever. All the humor is still true to Shreks usual formula. The emotional moments between Shrek and the young heir, Arthur, are actually quite touching; as they're the only scenes that weren't sacrificed for jokes. Shrek even goes through some interesting character changes as he starts bonding with Arthur and the audience learns some very good reasons they the Ogre is so scared of fatherhood. Arthur himself, being voiced by Justin Timberlake, is actually a nice teenage character with realistic problems and a personal struggle the fans of the series can relate to.

A thorough look at both sides of the argument really makes it hard to tell if Shrek the Third is a bad movie or not. Like Ive mentioned, the Shrek series has a very strong premise which this movie does not follow as closely as it should. Its also worth noting, Andrew Adamson who started this series did not direction this movie, but he did conceive the story. There are many good reasons to not like this movie, but still enough guilt-free moments to genuinely enjoy it. So a little more direction and guidance might have made another brilliant Shrek like the first two movies, but Shrek the Third to me is just alright and is always going to be just alright.",1423180800,,4898,4.584474885844749

I wish I could pinpoint exactly why it is not as good, but I suspect it is a combination of small points, from the cliche Aurthur character to  boilerplate Shrek fear of fatherhood dilemma. For me the only highlights are Puss and Donkey, even Charming get tiresome despite Rupert Everett's wonderful work. To me these movies are pure escapist fun and I am not expecting anything more, but with this outing it is just no longer fun. Finally I find this Shrek has lost the wit the first two movies have, which may explain why it never worked for me. By the way I am not a very good writer mainly because I refuse to edit.

Shrek soon discovers that an ogre is not suited for all of the pomp surrounding a King's duties. He sets out with Donkey and Puss to find Arthur, another heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is up to his usual nasty tricks trying to assume the throne. I think you should watch the rest of this movie to find out the rest of the story.

1570850,3,B00005JPFT,"I don't know of too many movies that can capture the creativity and originality of the first Shrek, including the second one as well. That being said, we have been Shrek fans since the day we saw the first one in the theaters, and haven't missed one since.

The plot is that of a usual Shrek plot, where Shrek is caught in a dilemma that he has to find a way to get out of. His dilemma in particular is that he in no way shape or form wants to take over as King when Fiona's frog---dad passes on. This embarks Shrek on mission to find next of kin, which happens to be a high school kid named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Shrek sets off on a mission to find Arthur, but runs into problems when Arthur refuses to go with him. Meanwhile, back at Far Far Away, Fiona and gang have their hands full as Prince Charming and his entourage of bitter and vengeful fairy tale character attempt a take-over.

The ending, of course, is a happy one, and without giving too much of the plot away, Shrek, Fiona and the rest of the ""good"" gang end up getting what they want.

Overall, this is a decent movie for Shrek fans. It is definitely not the best in my opinion, but fans will appreciate the silly humor and references that are so common in Shrek movies. However, if you haven't seen this movie yet (as most Shrek fans probably have), just keep in mind that you probably won't come away thinking this is as good as the first one.

Way better than much of the stuff out there for kids.  My only gripe is the un-necessary borderline-adult humor from time to time.  No need for that in a kids movie and very disappointing that we have to put up with it for our kids to enjoy an otherwise very good and entertaining movie.",1302825600,,573,4.317757009345795
1570852,3,B00005JPFT,"`Shrek the Third' is a rather lack lustre addition to the Shrek series of films and whilst perfectly enjoyable, it seems to be missing a key element.

This follows Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots as they go to collect Finoa's cousin, Arthur, to install him as King after Fiona's father dies and Shrek doesn't want to become King or have the responsibility of the kingdom.  There is also the side story of Fiona's pregnancy and Shrek's hesitancy in ruling the kingdom is mirrored in his hesitancy in becoming a father.

The characters are still voiced by the star cast we have come to love, as well as the addition of Justin Timberlake as Arthur.  The animation is also very good, as we have come to expect, and whilst other animated films have caught up to Shrek in their quality, this film still manages to do it very well indeed.

The fairy tale `in jokes' are also prevalent and whilst they still raise a smile, they have mostly been exhausted and can't make you laugh throughout like the first two films did.  In fact this may be the key element that I mentioned is missing, originality.  This has all the components of a good animated film, but lacks any originality.

All in all this is a perfectly enjoyable, animated film and should please fans of the previous films.  Just don't expect the style or verve of the first two films and you won't be disappointed.  Good but not great.

1570934,4,B00005JPFT,"With the fourth installment of the Shrek franchise hitting theaters today, I've been seeing a lot of reviews posing the question ""Is the new Shrek better than the disappointing `Shrek the Third'?""  I don't like this question.  Now, I have not seen this new Shrek film as of yet, but I feel compelled to defend the third film now since, in my opinion, it was far from disappointing.

In fact, both my wife and I concluded that this was better than the second Shrek film.

The plot revolves around Shrek becoming heir to the throne of Far, Far Away when Fiona's father dies.  He's not really suited for the Kingly life so he sets out on a journey to find Arthur, the only other heir to the throne, and bring him back to claim his place.  There are a few problems.  Arthur (or Artie as he is better known) is a rebellious teen who isn't really suited for Kingly duties either.  You also have the bitter Prince Charming who is determined to overtake the throne, even if that means imprisoning the recently impregnated Fiona.

Well, it's not like Fiona can't take care of herself.

If any of the Shrek films meandered or lost steam it was the second film.  For me, `Shrek the Third' was a step in the right direction.  Sure, it isn't as fresh or exciting as the first film, but none of them have been.  BUT, this film is funny, witty and charming.  The voice performances by the entire cast (including the newbie, Timberlake) are all top notch, and the gags here are one laugh after another.

I know it's been noted, but that whole `Puss-in-Boots swapping bodies with Donkey' scene is hilarious!

I don't get the hate here.  It really makes very little sense to me.  The film is entertaining from start to finish and capitalizes on everything that makes these Shrek movies so fun and engaging.  I understand that people may have been expecting more, but in the end this film really does deliver a memorable good time.",1274400000,2,1912,4.521865889212828

One very big reason of many of course is that I am a HUGE Justin Timberlake/*NSYNC fan(Who cares if that 2001??)!! For some reason, I just like his voice. Anyways, I don't know why this DVD has bad reviews on it. This was a very cute movie. As before, when King Harold suddenly says he's dying,he names Shrek the heir, Shrek immediately refuses and asks Harold if there is anyone else. Harold names off Artie(Justin Timberlake(Alpha Dog, Edison Force, Model Behavior, Long Shot, etc.)) When Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find Artie, they are in for a surprise. When they are first told where to find Artie, he's out on the jousting field. There's a man on a horse, which Shrek, Donkey, and Puss immediately take for Artie, but actually Artie is being used as a jousting target on a wooden horse, for which he gets thrown into the air by the oncoming opponent, and lands hard on the ground to which Shrek asks where to find 'Arthur' and Artie(unbeknowns to Shrek, Donkey, and Puss) asks if they are looking for Artie, after having been stepped on on the ground. The trio automatically dismiss Artie, telling him to be quiet. Shrek grabs Lancelot thinking he's Artie and starts to walk away with him, when Lancelot rudely informs Shrek that he is not Artie. This movie is really cute and i would recommend this to anyone over the age of ten years old. I can seriously relate to Artie, beings i was picked on as a kid and having not 'fit in' with almost everyone else. My dad didn't like this movie, but i did. I hope everyone else who looks at this review finds this helpful!!

1571176,3,B00005JPFT,"The third outing for the Shrek franchise is serviceable and amusing - no joke too low to stoop for, which will amuse adolescents and anyone younger as it demolishes high-school mope-fests, the Arthurian legends, dinner-theater venues and the princess phenomenon along with Far Far Away's throne room. Shrek the Third struck a lot of reviewers as claim out of which all the original wit had been mined, and perhaps they have a point. Now we know what to expect; this is just the continuation of the story of a love-struck ogre coping with love and responsibility in a deeply skewed world. But watching Shrek The Third remains a more agreeable use of an hour and a half than a lot of other movies out there, first run and DVD release. The princesses storming the castle with the aid of Snow White's little woodland friends and a blast of ""Barracuda"" is definitely worth the cost of the DVD, as is Eric Idle voicing the befuddled Merlin as a nervous high school teacher.

The extras included are generous and a bit of a mixed bag: Artie's Worchester High yearbook is a very long and detailed send-up, and funnier if the viewer knows the Arthurian canon. The ""Donkey Dance"" is a quick and witty parody of ""Safety Dance"", but the ""lost scenes"" are just original story-board sketches with outlining an assortment of scenes not developed past that point. (We lost interest at the first, and fast-forwarded through the next two.) ""Big Green Goofs"" are a disturbing collection of computer glitches involving the characters animations and scenes which was at least interesting. ""Shrek's Guide to Parenting"" offered advice from various characters on child-rearing: Puss in Boot's advice was the funniest.",1243728000,,1693,4.919580419580419

1571179,3,B00005JPFT,"But even a ""bad"" Shrek movie is more fun than most movies.

That said, why didn't it work like the first two?

1.  Uncompelling story that missed a huge opportunity for new satire.  Rather than rehash Prince Charming and have him storm the city of Far Far Away and then have Shrek's people storm it again (I think that castle's been stormed three times in two movies!), how about making the movie a spoof of the whole King Arthur mythology?  That would have been fun.  And what's funny and sad is that when I watched the storyboarded ""deleted scenes"" in the special features, they were more funny than most of the stuff in the movie!!

2.  Too dark and violent for too long.  A lot of the movie just wasn't fun at all.

3.  Crass use of popular music sound bytes.  One of the fun things about Shrek movies is the use of popular music tunes, and they were used very effectively in the first two movies.  But why did I have to hear ""Live and Let Die"" for a frog's funeral?  Or Heart's ""Barracuda"" when the gals storm the castle?  These loud heavy handed old rock tunes just switch in and out of the movie like someone is back there flipping the ""time for the popular"" tune switch, no matter if it really helps the story or not.

4.  Really really lame DVD menus.  I kept watching the DVD main menu screen waiting for something fun to happen, and it never did!

5.  And, you know something went wrong when there's no commentary track on the DVD.  At least I couldn't find one.

So, aside from the sheer escapism of Shrek, and a few good gags, like Gingy's life flashback, this was like someone just took leftover Shrek stuff out of the back of the fridge and cooked something up.  Twenty million hours of render time does not a satisfying story make!",1241481600,4,1747,4.340557275541796

1571181,3,B00005JPFT,"Shrek The Third is one hour and thirty-two minutes and was released May 18, 2007. This picks up where two left off. King Harold is on his death bed and is nearly ready to croak. He informs Shrek (who does not want to be king) that there is one other, Arthur (Pendragon). Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots set off to retrieve Arthur. As the ship leaves, Fiona tells Shrek that she is pregnant. Shrek does look forward to being a father. He is worried that he would be a bad role model. The trio arrives at Worcestershire Academy where Arthur is a student. He is a sixteen year old kid who's from the school bullies to the class nerds taunt Arthur. Shrek tell Artie (as he likes to be called) that he is the new king of Far Far Away. At first Artie is excited about being king. On the ship Donkey and Puss In Boots start talking about the responsibilities of being king and Artie begins to have second thoughts. Artie tries to turn the ship. Shrek and Artie are now in a battle of the ship wheel and during the struggle the wheel breaks and the ship crash on some rocks. Shrek, Donkey, Puss In Boots, and Artie make it to shore. The foursome find the home of Merlin; a retired wizard from Artie old school. Meanwhile Prince Charming and all of the evil characters hatch a plot to take over Far Far Away. Prince Charming and the gang capture Fiona, Queen Lilian, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Doris the Ugly Stepsister, and Cinderella. Prince Charming finds out through one of the three little pigs that Arthur is the next in line and Shrek went to get him. Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and some thugs to kill Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots and bring back Arthur. Captain Hook and the thugs fail and Merlin cast a spell that would send all four of them back to Far Far Away. When they arrive at Far Far Away. Donkey is inside Puss In Boots body and Puss In Boots is in Donkey's body. The four make it back to the castle and Shrek finds his way to Prince Charming and is about to clobber him, however, Prince Charming is able to call for his men and capture Shrek. Shrek manages to trick Prince Charming to take him and let Artie go. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are thrown in the tower. Prince Charming plans to kill Shrek in a play tonight. Queen Lilian literally butts her head against a couple walls so the folks in the tower can escape. Once free the princess, Donkey, and Puss In Boots make plans to win back Far Far Away and save Shrek. At the theater Prince Charming is at the part in the play where he is about to kill Shrek until troops arrive and are about to save him until Prince Charming summing his thugs and captures the rescuers. Just as about Prince Charming is about to slew Shrek, Arthur arrives and reason with the villains to turn over a new leaf. The villains lay down their weapons and release the captives. Prince Charming is angry and picks up a sword to kill Arthur, but Shrek intervenes and is able to save Arthur and defeat Prince Charming. Arthur finally accepts the crown. Shrek and Fiona become parents of triplets. The first half of the movie is not bad, but fall about at the end. The movie could have a better ending and more story. I can only give Shrek The Third a C+.

1571253,1,B00005JPFT,"This is where they officially 'jumped the shark' with his production. I remember Mike Myers having to go on tour to promote this film and not only did he seem to cringe trying to explain it or talk about, he very clearly seemed depressed about it.

Like so many others have said, the allure of the original film has long since vanished and leaves this current offering from Dreamworks as probably the worst movie they've ever made.

Recently, I realized how much my son loved the original Shrek movie when he kept bringing me the DVD case in the afternoon and pointing at the TV wanting to watch it. He laughed during the silly parts, clapped during and after the fight scenes and danced during all the songs. Twenty minutes into the third installment, he turned away, left the room and wanted nothing to do with it. I turned it off and he went back to coloring. About an hour later, out of curiosity, I put the original Shrek back in the DVD and he was stuck to it - once more - clapping, laughing and dancing until the very end where he danced to the 'Swamp Party Karaoke' scene.

I guess the message is this: Shrek isn't a played out concept at all. Shrek is very endearing and a lovable character. He always will be. I actually like Donkey the best. But the people in charge of this project forgot who this film was supposed to be targeted at and thus have been left with a real stinker.

The sad thing is that we will probably see Shrek 4 sometime soon, and they'll be trying to hammer home more of this adult-driven nonsense.",1224892800,,1531,4.380281690140845

Shrek is only for 14 and below screamers now, unfortunately it'll still make money from kids keeping the drivel like #3 alive.

The princess are capable to destroy stone walls with his head, but are not capable to defeat the castle guards (just as an example).

1571361,5,B00005JPFT,"I naturally went into this film skeptical due to the many negative reviews. Let me tell you that in my own personal opinion the third installment of the Shrek universe was just as enjoyable as the first two. It gives us the old school fairy tale characters and sticks them in yet more unusual positions. The usual damsels in distress are forced to fend for themselves and fight back against the villains. We're also given the delightful treat of seeing a young King Arthur be taken to Far Far Away to claim his throne.

The story goes that now Shrek and Fiona are married and settled in together, they're forced to undertake royal duties for a time whilst the previous king gets better. There's a snag though, as the king dies leaving Shrek with a message. He's not the only heir to the throne and if he doesn't want the job he must track down a boy named Arthur. Shrek, Puss and Donkey set off on the journey to find Arthur leaving the women home alone. Meanwhile, Prince Charming has gathered together some of the most evil fairy tale villains to take control of Far Far Away and to get revenge on Shrek once and for all. Will the gang succeed in defeating one of their biggest challenges? Well, you'll have to watch the movie and see won't you.

This is a great sequel and an excellent addition to the franchise. We're introduced to a few new characters in this one. The lovable loser, Arthur played by Justin Timberlake. The eccentric and slightly mad Merlin, voiced by the legend Eric Idle. The damsels are also a great addition to this film especially sleeping beauty. I found myself in tears of laughter at her constant nodding off at the most inappropriate times.

Brilliant movie and is something that all Shrek fans shouldn't shy away from. Also we have to look forward to the fourth installment due out in 2010.",1216339200,,1822,4.548780487804878

My family and I really wanted to like this movie.  We rented it and Ratatouille the same weekend, and guess which was the more memorable of the non-human characters?

The problem is, you get a sense this film was written by a committee of corporate types who rather than deciding to tell a good story, decided to show the world how clever they are.  You never connect with this film, as it is gag, after gag, like a bad vaudeville sketch.

It was funny as all get-out, had great heart, and although the super animation changed the character's features a bit and the plentiful Special Features were a bit weird, I LOVED this DVD.  I'm not a big fan of JT, but I think he did all right in this, and I -adored- the princesses and their roles in this film. ^_^  The goofs, baby advice and yearbook features were the most fun for me, (again though, I thought the yearbook thing was a bit of a stretch since we didn't really explore the school characters -that- much), and I'm so glad to see they've kept up not only the wit, humor and charm of the first movie, but that they've retained its heart as well.  ..After all, without both aspects, it just wouldn't be Shrek. ;)

1571486,4,B00005JPFT,"Shrek The Third is a good movie with incredible animation. I marvel at that animation! However, the plot is just average and it didn't really hold my attention the way I hoped it would. I think after this Dreamworks needs to move on to new develop new characters in new films; but only time will tell if Dreamworks wants to milk this theme yet again. The voiceovers are very well done and the DVD has a plethora of extras.

When the action begins, Shrek (Mike Myers) and his wife Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the ailing King Harold (John Cleese). Unfortunately, King Harold passes away and, with his dying wish, names Shrek as the rightful heir to the throne. This doesn't sit too well with Shrek who has been suffering from public relations embarrassment to public relations embarrassment as he launches ships with such strength that the ship blows a hole and sinks--and more. King Harold says, just before he dies, that the only other heir to the throne would be a young man at school named Arthur (Justin Timberlake). Immediately after the funeral for King Harold, Shrek, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss-in-boots (Antonio Banderas) set sail to find Arthur at school. Things go downhill even more when Artie (as Arthur is called) is ambivalent at best to become a king; and it's up to Shrek and his buddies to convince Arthur to become king.

Of course, things back in Far, Far Away Land aren't much better. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and his cronies take over the kingdom and imprison Fiona and her friends including Fiona's mother. Things look pretty bleak.

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. (Yes, I know, you've read the spoilers by now but I won't give them away anyway.) Will Fiona and the other women be able to break free and fight the evil Prince Charming? How does Shrek react when he finds out he's becoming a father? What happens to Puss-in-boots and Donkey when an old wizard accidentally casts a spell on them so that they are trapped in each other's bodies? Watch the movie and find out!

The DVD extras are very extensive. The commentary is great; and I like the bonus feature that includes a man going through a storyboard of a deleted scene at the school where Arthur is standing on line to get his lunch. There are funny ""suggestions"" from Donkey, Shrek and other characters as to how to deal with the problems of parenthood; and there are web links as well.

Overall, this is a good effort and a movie to watch when a better one is unavailable. However, Shrek fans will love this movie. This is best suited for families with kids that are at least 8 or 9 years old because of some crude humor that you wouldn't want younger kids to experience.",1213401600,19,2703,4.611226611226611

The characters are great, the lines funny and the surprises surprising.  A trifecta!",1203638400,,224,4.717948717948718
1571589,3,B00005JPFT,"Shrek turned out to be a an unexpected hit when it was released in 2001 and expanding on the succes of the first one Dreamworks studio ultimatly made a sequel,the simply titled Shrek 2 wich was not only better at the box office than the previous but also better as a movie. Shrek The Third,the second sequel is somewhat lacking what the previous two movies in the franchise had,orginality. Yet it stills manages to keep young and old fans satisfied,as there is still plenty of the same humor that made the other Shrek films so good. I was pretty sure they could never top Shrek 2 and this third movie didn't. The plot and humor sadly aren't as good as they could and should have been,even if some parts are funny like Pinocchio and Gingerbread Man's parts.

The plot for this third movie in the Shrek series,is with the death of Fiona's father King Harold,the king of Far Far Away,Shrek becomes the next king. The thing is he doesn't accept that responsability so he goes on quest to recruit the perfect king. His choice settles on a young boy named Arthur but before he can bring him to his throne,Far Far Away is being invaded by Prince Charming who beleves HE must be king and an army of villains. The execution of the script to the big screen was rather average,nothing really special except a thing or two that was funny but i think that after this rather disapointing third movie Shrek has miles ahead if they want to recover their former glory. For Dreamworks its pretty much ""Well,as long as it gets us cash"" situation but they should pay closer attention to Shrek 4 cause if that one turns out like the third things are going to get bad.

The visuals are one thing that they have actually done better than Shrek 1 and 2. They look stunning for a 3D movie and can only get better in future Shrek movies,its good that they stuck with the same kind of visuals as well. Still i can't deny that i was disapointed when i walked out of the Movie Theather,it just wasn't the same thing than with the first two. Those where magical,histerical movies,filled with great moments that i still remember today. With this third instalment of the series i can't say it sucked but i can't say it was that great either.

That said its still satisfying but just not up to par with the first two films in terms of appreciation. The soundtrack remains great as the others with some classic and new songs,notably Led Zeppelin's classic ""Immigrant Song"" wich was played during a part of the movie's commercial. Its nice that despite everything they still have the orginal voice actors after all that time. Have anyone else noticed how the camera is less on Shrek,Donkey and Puss than in previous movies?It also seems to be aimed at a younger audience than the first two,its more fart jokes and such. As a mature person i would have to stick with my rating and opinion and give it a three,if it is rated for a kid movie then it would get a five,if you have kids by all means buy it for them they will have a great time. Lets hope for the next Shrek movies they turn out better than ""Shrek The Third"".",1203465600,2,3084,4.4548672566371685

I also love how much off-color humor is slipped past the little ones.  Shrek 1 and 2 also speak to some profound life-truths (if you can see past the fart jokes).  In stark contrast, this third attempt is a total train wreck in every conceivable way and is totally devoid of the soul which made the others so wonderful.

A prime example of where they went off the tracks is a scene where Princess Fiona watches her father die.  Any normal person would know that's a topic that can't be made funny and should be treated in a gentle/ respectful fashion. But not here: they tried to crack jokes as the king is gasping for breath . . .  I just cringed. That single scene was so awful, it basically destroyed the rest of the movie for me.

Shrek 3 was literally devoid of humor and I never had one good ""belly laugh"" (i.e. Pinocchio's underwear scene from Shrek 2).  Also, in the first two, there were some touching scenes of character development and heartwarming vulnerability.  Here, that was abandoned and everyone just went through the motions.

1571925,3,B00005JPFT,"Upon seeing the first two Shrek movies, which were entertaining and funny, Shrek 3 was a must-see.  Sequels seldom outperform the original, but Shrek 2 did pretty well.  Unfortunately Shrek the Third, lacked the charmingness of the first two movies.  Justin Timberlake voicing ""Artie"" as the only newcomer, was good enough, but I couldn't help the fact this movie was about ""Artie"" and not Shrek.  In this new installment, Shrek & Fiona become the servants of vengeful Prince Charming.  They also welcome a new addition to their Ogre family.  Artie is Fiona's cousin who is next in line to a reluctant ""King"" Shrek.  Artie is the typical ""high school outcast"" in most teen flicks, that ends up winning, at least in this movie ""a kingdom"".  Shrek the Third started out promisingly enough, with many laughs in the beginning.  As soon as it morphed into a teen comedy, some of the charm was taken away.  Animation wise, it's as excellent as the first 2.  Story wise, it borrowed too many elements from other cliched comedies.",1199750400,,1022,4.816091954022989

What were they thinking?

The characters, new and old, could have mailed in their performance from planet Zarquan, and the plot line, when there WAS one, was little more than a platform for political finger wagging! This Shrek might as well have been written by Michael Moore!

And I'm thinkin Walt Disney wouldn't have been too thrilled to see Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White hanging out with a drag queen, regardless of how PC the concept. Not quite the Disney image he spent his life creating.

For you who do enjoy adult political and social commentary disguised as childrens' entertainment, my copy of Shrek the Third is for sale for 2 cents, and IMO, it's still overpriced.",1198713600,,829,4.696551724137931

There were some pretty adult jokes in Shrek 3--more than in the previous two films, so I'm not sure that I would let my three-year old daughter watch it.  There is also a death in the film, so if you're not ready to explain to your child what's happening, it may not be appropriate. It is certainly an adult-oriented comedy.

The acting (voices) were spectacular and the animation was flawless, as always, but the story line is where this movie went astray.

3 stars for the funny, yet flawed Shrek 3.",1198713600,,771,4.503597122302159

I really enjoyed this, I laughed, and I certainly feel the need to own it (and I'm not a big DVD buyer).

SHREK THE THIRD carries on the good hearted fractured fairy tale themes of its predecessors but the misunderstood ogre gimmick is beginning to wear a bit thin.  Shrek and Fiona still make a sweet couple and Puss (Antonio Bandaras) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) continue to play their parts as amusing sidekicks well.  The scenes at the medieval high school where Shrek and Company pick up the future King Arthur (Justin Timberlake) who is a bit of a teenage dweeb are quite amusing.  However some of the scenes such as at the villain tavern just seem so ""busy"" with ideas and characters that the viewer can't absorb it all.  I also didn't care for Fiona's fairy tale princess friends who get imprisoned and then escape with her and her mom (Julie Andrews) back in Far Far Away.  I did like the pop songs used on the soundtrack and the animation is stunning from beginning to end.  As in the other SHREK films there is an important message that all should believe in  themselves though young viewers might be a bit confused by Shrek's fear of becoming a father which is happily resolved by the film's ending.  SHREK THE THIRD is not a bad film but I hope Dreamworks is satisfied at leaving the series as a trilogy.",1197676800,,1382,4.4563492063492065

Maybe so, but my wife and I found ourselves laughing out loud and throughly charmed. We'll have to watch it several times to glean all the subtleties, sight gags and double entendres.

1573102,4,B00005JPFT,"My wife and I recently watched Shrek the Third on HD DVD. On HD DVD viewers should be impressed with the beautiful picture, nice bright colors and excellent detail on the animation and this disc doesn't disappoint at all. Prince Charming's hair flows in various directions, shadows and lighting throughout show great attention to detail by the animators/rendering team, etc.

Story wise this was, as most critics seemed to point out, probably the weakest of the 3 movies, but not bad. If the first two movies hadn't set the bar so high, this one would have been better received, but a lot of the sight gags and inside jokes have been done in the first two movies, so you aren't as shocked and don't react as well this time.  (Note that there is one great sequence with the Gingerbread man {Gingy} that is almost worth the price of the disc by itself.)  Be aware that this film is also somewhat darker at longer periods of time (story wise) than in the first two movies.

I have some questions about the extras that are available for this movie, as I'm curious if the web enabled updates will (as they should) add content over time for this title.  For example, my wife was looking for a segment of the Puss-in-boots dance similar to the Donkey dance segment that is available in the extras/web content.  If that sort of content is made available later, then the web enabled updates features will prove to be quite valuable for a movie like this.

Worth the purchase price to me, but I suspect this one is more likely a rental for many viewers. I would love to see it packaged up as the Shrek Trilogy so that I could get the first two movies in HD (I have both on DVD, first movie on two disc DVD I think). If that is done, I hope they don't cheap out on the extras and include as much as they can in the set.",1197158400,,1808,4.363095238095238

The fairy tale princesses -- Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Snow White, etc.  -- are pretty much indistinguishable from one another (except that Sleeping Beauty keeps nodding off and Rapunzel has long hair). Julie Andrews as the Queen has perhaps five lines in the whole movie, although her character is onscreen much more than that. Mostly she just stands around and observes. There are some fun bits, and Jason Timberlake, teenage heart-throb, is on hand a Prince Artie. He's not bad at all. And Eric Idle as Merlin is fun. The other characters just continue doing what they did in the last two films, although to a lesser degree. And in this film, more than in any of the other current animated features, it's quite obvious that each actor was in the recording booth alone. There is no interaction, no conversation: only overlapping monologues. (To see what a difference it makes to have the cast performing together, try SURF'S UP.) Technically it's the best of the three, but otherwise, the second one surpasses this...and the first surpassed that.

1573392,3,B00005JPFT,"Well, Shrek the Third definitely will satsify fans of the trilogy. After all, who wouldn't love to see more fairy tale jokes? All the visuals were very impressive. I especially loved the tribute to Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", using the actual audio track from one of the songs. However, all in all, I was Shreked out. I was tired of the same old jokes.
The story isn't bad. In the plot, the king of Ever After land, in his dying words, names Shrek the new king. Shrek, however, isn't willing to work his butt off as king, so he asks the king whether there is a second in line. The king then names a boy named Arthur as the king after Shrek. The main story focuses on Shrek finding Artie, while Prince Charming gathers villains together to take over the kingdom.
There were many scenes I chuckled at, such as the kingdom that was modeled after a high school. However, I didn't like the teenage Arthur character, played miserably by Justin Timberlake. And I didn't think the villains were as smart as they could have been. Somehow, in the end, Arthur convinces the villains that they could do something more worthwhile, rather than fight. And Prince Charming is left with an empty vendetta against Shrek, taunted at by everyone else.
I'm not saying that this movie is a bad movie. I've just seen this same old hero-wins-all storyline before and I think ""Ratatouille"" is a far better bang for people's buck (and more original too).",1195862400,2,1450,4.602316602316602

1573394,3,B00005JPFT,"I rather enjoyed the original Shrek movie. It was different, and in an amusing way. The animation was excellent and the movie was somehow appealing. Shrek 2 was OK., but I didn't get the same enjoyment as with the first. I guess that's the usual case with sequels. I felt a little burned out on the whole idea. Lately, my fiance, who liked the Shrek movies better than I did, picked up the Shrek the Third DVD when we last visited the local warehouse club. We watched it a couple evenings later. I was feeling negative toward viewing another Shreck thing and that may have tainted the experience.

Shrek the Third is well done. It's a polished piece of work. The animation is terrific. In  places, the film seems so realistic I have difficulty believing it's an animation. If this is the first Shrek movie someone has viewed, I think they would probably find it interesting and amusing. However, this is the third one for me and it just doesn't have much to offer beyond the first two. The word ""stale"" comes to mind. The movie has some funny sight gags and there's a few mild chuckles here and there. The story is light and frivolous. My main reaction on watching was mild boredom and I began to wonder when it would be over.

I'd say that Shrek the Third is stale and uninteresting. That about sums it up. If you haven't seen a Shrek movie you might enjoy it, although I'd suggest the original or even the second. Kids might enjoy it. For the rest, I'd suggest that there's better films available.

I hesitated to buy or even rent Shrek 3. I'd read a review when it opened that suggested it fell very short of the other two. But I found a deal I couldn't pass up, and even if it was slightly amusing I thought it might produce a few giggles. If nothing else, the infamous Puss-in-Boots big-eyed, poor kitty stare was worth the price of Shrek 2.

Surprisingly, I found much to enjoy. A twist on the traditional Puss-in-Boots eyes brought a smile. Prince Charming's dinner theater gig gone bad was another amusing scene.

It's creative, well-written and still amusing. It would be impossible to produce a Shrek movie without relying on some of the tried and true Shrek and company gags. Magic gone wrong with funny results, of course. Princesses with attitude, only a few minutes worth and still watchable.

A gentler Fiona and a slightly tamer Shrek are to be expected because people do grow and change, after all - it stands then that ogres might also. Donkey as a daddy plays.

There are still some sparks of clever humor and an efficient use of satire at certain times, but there are portions of the film that come close to putting the audience to sleep. Overall, I would have to say that this production shows an uneven quality throughout its duration, and that it is reaching that point commonly known for series as jump-the-shark.

This time around, the story deals with filling the position of king of Far Far Away. The Frog King, while in his deathbed, asks Shrek to do this, together with Fiona, but the ogre could not be less interested. Thus, he goes on a quest to find Arthur, Fiona's cousin, to take the hot seat. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is plotting, together with every villain that ever existed in a fairy tale, to overthrow the current government and take possession of the throne. Ohh! I almost forgot; there is the small issue of the pregnancy!

As mentioned before, there are some segments in which the satiric elements make us laugh and keep us entertained, especially when Shrek visits Arthur's high school.

After watching Shrek 3, it made my IQ down quite a bit.  With how mature the kids are today, even 10 yr olds would see this movie as being dumb.

1573597,4,B00005JPFT,"Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are still in Far Far Away.  Fiona's father, King Harold the frog (John Cleese), is dying, and the two are filling in for him at state functions.  Shrek's really trying to handle things correctly, but he always makes a mess of things.

Unfotunately, King Harold croaks.  But before he does, he tells Shrek that Fiona isn't the only heir to the throne.  She has a distant cousin, Arthur (Justin Timberlake), who could become king.  Since Shrek wants to return to the swamp and give up life in the palace, he sets off with his faithful friends Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the heir.

Meanwhile, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has been reduced to acting in bad dinner theater.  After one especially bad performance, he decides to take what he feels is rightfully his.  So he enlists the aid of every fairy tale villain he can find.  This time, they are going to get their happily ever after.  Will his plan succeed?  Can Shrek find Arthur?

Like the first two, Shrek the Third is a funny film.  There is still plenty of the bathroom humor that was present in the first two, but the double meanings and suggestion jokes seemed to be gone.  Frankly, I was thankful for this.  Yet there was still plenty of satire for the adults to laugh at.  In fact, I think I heard more adults laughing then kids in the packed theater when I first saw it.

All the previous main and minor characters are back, plus a plethora of new friends.  We've got King Arthur and assorted other Arthurian characters for starters.  Plus Fiona is visited by Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Rapunzel. And having Prince Charming team up with the other villains was brilliant.  Frankly, this is the film HAPPILY N'EVER AFTER wished it could be.  Yet the story is still fast moving with a good moral.  Yes, we're still talking about self-acceptance, but they find a fresh take on it that ties in with the first two.

A word of warning about the death scene.  It is long and drawn out.  While played for laughs (and it is pretty funny), it might be too much for some kids.  Granted, it is a frog, but it also is Fiona's father.  Every child is different, so you know best how your will react.  But consider that before they watch.

I've spent most of the review praising the film.  I really did enjoy it.  But I did feel it wasn't as funny as the first two.  While there were still plenty of laughs and satire, some of the bite was gone.  It's good, but it doesn't live up to the other two.  And, with all the characters, some got short changed.  For example, Julie Andrew's queen has plenty of screen time, but she hardly has any lines.

In the end, this is another fun animated comedy that the entire family will enjoy.",1195171200,2,2779,4.4969939879759515
1573598,5,B00005JPFT,"I don't know why some critics and even some customers here at Amazon have been so grumpy about the third Shrek film.  Maybe they have a bone to pick with Dreamworks -- I don't know.  I do know I saw ""Shrek the Third"" in the theater when it opened, and our sophisticated NYC audience rocked with laughter from start to finish.  Watching the DVD, I busted out laughing again just as many times, and I wound up crying at the ending, which features both a decidedly welcome non-violent catharsis as well as an uplifting message.  And then come Puss and Donkey dancing along to ""Thank You for Letting Be Myself Again"" during the end credits.  I could watch these two all day -- speak about star quality!  Really my only gripe about this DVD is that I would have liked director's commentary, but otherwise -- if you like Shrek, I don't think you can go wrong with ""Shrek 3"".  The animation is the best of the series, and the cast keeps adding more talent, most notably here Eric Idle and the ladies comprising the Fighting Princess Team.  Side-splitting, heart-warming, and heartily recommended...",1195084800,,1091,4.645833333333333

Everything looks much more realistic this time around. Shrek has lost the somewhat plastic look of the first two movies and the performances are much more subtle and real (well, as subtle as Shrek is going to get anyway.) I loved some of the looks that got thrown around between Shrek, Donkey and Puss.

All the characters from the first two movies are back, and that makes for some impressive crowd scenes, and there are a lot of them in this movie. Far Far Away has become a much more populated, and much more diverse place. As well as the palace there are also run down alleys, boat docks, harbors, forests, a medieval high school, a hermits hut, several dungeons, and a rather impressive stage for Prince Charming.

All the original actors are back doing their character's voices and that makes for a wonderful continuity and a great sense of family and familiarity in the show.

Perhaps this isn't the best Shrek storywise, but it is a good story, with plenty of humor, one-liners, catchy songs, and absolutely gorgeous imagery.

And baby ogres of course. They're worth it all by them selves. (And, in my opinion, Julie Andrews as the Queen steals the show when she upstages all the snooty young princesses. :) )",1194998400,,1565,5.248

Amusing story, good animation, and another round of the characters we enjoy. This time Prince Charming is looking for payback and enlists the bad guys and gals from all the fairytales to help him. While Shrek is off looking for Arthur ""Arty"" Penndragon to take over a kings crown he doesn't want, the castle is invaded by Charming. All the fairytale ladies have to break out of the tower and give a nice fight sequence, but are recaptured. Shrek returns and with the help of Arty, saves the day. My only complaint is they put way to much time into sophomoric characterizations in the extras about the kids at Arty's high school where Shrek found him.

So when I went to the cinema to see this third installment I was actually a little dissapointed with what I got to see. The movie is by no means a bad one. It's an okay movie but lacks the power that the first two movies had. It all looks better then before, the voice-acting is wicked cool, yet again and there are some really funny bits in there.

So why didn't it catch my attention better? I honestly couldn't say why, the only thing I can think of is that this movie gives a little feeling of a been there, done that vibe.

Picking up from where Shrek 2 left off, Shrek 3 continues to shed light on the lovable duo and the rest of the original, and truly adorable, entourage.
Apart from all the fun and humor (and there is so much of it!), it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.
Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.
The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the HUMOR (!!!) and the music (!) are all wonderful!
In short, Shrek the Third is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
Strongly recommended along with the previous two Shrek movies, the Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.",1190505600,4,1647,4.7317073170731705

I did enjoy the last 20 minutes or so (won't spoil anything). But in between, there was not enough material to make it worth your time.

1573768,4,B00005JPFT,"Some SPOILERS follow.

Even though Shrek - Sir Shrek, that is - and Princess Fiona have become a fixture at the royal court of the kingdom of Far Far Away, it doesn't mean that our ogrish hero has to like it. With Fiona's father having been transformed into a frog (see SHREK 2) and then falling ill, Shrek grumpily chips in by undertaking some of his dad-in-law's royal chores. But the mantle of the purple settles uncomfortably on Shrek's shoulders (and it probably itches, too). All he really wants to do is take Fiona and go back to his beloved swamps. But that would have to wait when the fast expiring King names Shrek as his successor. But Shrek doesn't want the crown and so, with Donkey and Puss in Boots in tow and again providing sidekick duties, he goes on a journey to fetch the next guy in line for the throne - Prince Arthur. Of course, there are obstacles awaiting Shrek. For one thing, Fiona lays down some news which distresses our ogre. Then Prince Charming, who's been reduced to entertaining in dinner theater, decides to make another bid for his own ""happily ever after."" Accordingly, he manages to enlist a heapload of fairy tale villains (Captain Hook, Rumpelstiltskin, the Headless Horseman, the Cyclops, several villainous trees, and more...).

SHREK THE THIRD, while being a fun and funny flick, is the least of the three Shrek movies. Of course, the element of surprise, which made the first Shrek film such an uberhit as it riotously turned fairy tale tradition on its ear, is long since gone. The sequel provided us with the kingdom of Far Far Away, which paved the way for even more snarky, nudge-in-the-rib stabs at pop culture in general and at the Disney film factory line in particular. Some of the wit is still here in SHREK THE THIRD, though not as razor sharp. The humor still made me smile, though it wasn't quite as subversive or as disarming. Basically, it's all stuff I'd seen already. I was waiting for something new to knock me off my feet. It didn't happen.

The movie suffers most when the spotlight is on its newest character Prince Arthur. As voiced by Justin Timberlake, ""Artie's"" tepid personality proves to be a detriment not so easily brushed aside. Artie is introduced as a loser teen and then, as the film progresses, supposedly shows his mettle when he reveals his smarts by throwing a crying fit and, later on, by unveiling his gift of gab (where was this when he was getting picked on in medieval high school?). To me, Artie comes off as wheedling and even a bit disingenuous. The fact that he took screen time away from Shrek and that he has a significant role to play in the film's resolution just doesn't sit well with me.

Points are also taken away for not giving heftier roles to Donkey and Puss in Boots. These two great characters are pretty much relegated to the background. Their one highlight sub-plot, which has them switching bodies, doesn't pay off with anything significant and is, therefore, superfluous and lame to the nth power. It was funny, though, to watch Puss, while in Donkey's form, attempt to use his ""cute"" power.

Despite a nagging feeling of ""Is that it?"" I have to point out that there's still so much going for this film. For one thing, the old reliables are at it again. Mike Meyers as Shrek, Cameron Diaz as Fiona, Eddie Murphy as Donkey, and Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots have their characters down pat and their voice performances are seamless. Meanwhile, John Cleese as the frog king is priceless in his one prolonged cameo. Newcomers of note are Eric Idle as the slightly skewed Merlin and several SNL actresses portraying various fairy tale princesses. Rupert Everett also returns as that royal swine Prince Charming and is majestically over the top, while Ian McShane has several standout moments as Captain Hook.

The incorporation of classic rock music adds a nice touch to several scenes, although it's a bit odd to hear Led Zeppelin, Heart, and Wings in an animation. But, hey, any chance to hear ""Barracuda"" or ""Live and Let Die"" is a good thing. The animation? Wow! It's amazing. If anything, the CG is even better than in the prior Shrek flicks. For example, the expressions on the characters' faces are realistically conveyed. Even when groaning thru the one scene of Prince Charming tossing his hair in slow motion, I still couldn't help but note the excellence of the graphics. So, yes, a well-deserved pat on the back for DreamWorks.

SHREK THE THIRD has already made piles of money and stands to make even more with the dvd release. And, apparently, a fourth installment is in the works, as well as a Puss in Boots spin-off. While this third film doesn't live up to the quality and originality of the first two, it still boasts several sparkling moments, the aforementioned frog king scene being only one of 'em. There are also some nice bits with the Princesses Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty. I also liked that the medieval high school girls spoke with ""thees"" and ""thous"" but in a Valley accent. And, of course and always, at the heart of this franchise, there is Shrek, the cantankerous ogre with the heart of gold. True, he doesn't do much here (his supporting cast supply most of the smiting) but he does provide the grounding element of the movie and remains the preferred point of view character for the audience. As more Shrek movies are churned out, it's nice to see that some things do stay the same.

SHREK THE THIRD elicits some laughs, plenty of smiles, and, sadly, a few yawns. The good will garnered from the first two installments goes quite a ways in carrying this film. Ultimately, I do consider the time and money to have been well spent on this one. So, yes, I got my Shrek on, now go get yours.",1188086400,14,5741,4.654832347140039
1573769,4,B00005JPFT,"Yes it's predictable, and the jokes come mainly from gags, but Shrek the Third is still entertaining -- as long as you see it in the right mood. Sure, it's not as good as the first two, but I still like it.

First, because it skewers the Disney princesses, turning Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White into yuppie snobs. I like Disney's stories, but I'm so familiar with them that it's nice to see a good parody.

And second, because of the music. I never liked Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" until I heard it in this context. I likewise have a new appreciation for Wings' ""Live and Let Die."" Best of all, though, was Antonio Banderas and Eddie Murphy's energetic version of the Sly & the Family Stone classic, ""Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again).""

1573874,2,B00005JPFT,"When the first Shrek came out in theaters, I didn't bother to go see it since I thought it was a movie geared more towards little kids.  But after I heard more of the hype and some of my friends told me it was a really good flick for any age, I went ahead and bought it when it came out on DVD and it did not disappoint.  I was rolling on the floor!  When Shrek 2 came along, went and saw it in the theaters and was rolling in the aisles!

Before seeing any movie, I like to read reviews about it.  (Even if I know I'll want to see it anyway no matter what the reviews say)  I only read reviews by the everyday Joe, not critics since they usually go more to critique a movie, not to enjoy it.  Shrek 3 had mixed reviews, and I wished I had listened to the ones saying it sucked before I wasted my 5 bucks!

Shrek the Third stinks like your neighbor's cookin'!  The first 2 were great, the 2nd surpassing the first in some ways, but by the time they got to making the 3rd it seems like the writers had dug out of their recycle bins for ideas because they couldn't think of any fresh ones!  The story is dull and strung together, rarely any truly funny moments (maybe enough to give you a chuckle here and there), and a number of obvious jokes that a child of 6 could fill in went unused during the course of the movie!  Example:  When King Harold (as a frog) dies, Puss 'n' Boots just says, ""The king is dead."" or something to that affect.  HELLO!!!  Instead it should have been, ""The king has croaked.""!  It is pretty obvious and may be such a cheap joke that you could find it at a $.99 cent store, but a cheap joke here and there is better than none at all!  And that's pretty much what the 3rd Shrek movie has---nothing!

I can't believe that this movie did as well as it did at the box office.  Recently I read that Dreamworks already has Shrek 4 in the works (to be released in 2009) and that there is even talk of a Shrek 5!  If Shrek the 3rd is any indication of how the next one will be, they should have stopped at Shrek 2!  On the other hand, it might end up being like the Alien series; the 3rd one sucked, but the 4th (while not as good as the first 2) was still better than the 3rd one, no contest!",1186963200,12,2211,3.9931662870159452

When he learns of another relative in line for the throne, Shrek sets out with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) to find the long lost heir, Arthur (Justin Timberlake). While Shrek is gone, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) forms an army of evil doers and overtakes the city. Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and her friends fight back, so that all is chaos by the time Shrek returns.

I really enjoyed SHREK. I was even more impressed by SHREK 2 and in some ways think it is a superior movie to the original. I was really looking forward to seeing SHREK THE THIRD and seeing how creative the filmmakers would get bringing together the fairy tale world of Shrek and the legends of King Arthur.

I was severely disappointed to find that they chose not to be creative. The plot of the movie is interesting enough, but the execution is horrible. For instance, take the character of Merlin. Instead of making him into a strong ally who could help Shrek and Artie, he's portrayed as a bumbling teacher of magic who was fired from Artie's school. He can't remember his spells and seems to struggle with narcolepsy. That idea of Merlin seems funny on paper, but it just doesn't work on screen. Or take Prince Charming. In SHREK 2 he was portrayed as the chosen heir to marry Fiona, raised by Fairy Godmother and groomed to be the perfect King. In this installment he's downgraded to being a bad actor re-enacting Shrek's defeat of Fairy Godmother. Charming should be a great fighter and warrior, but instead he's portrayed as being a wimp who decides he will get his revenge by having a huge play where he literally kills Shrek on stage. Then there's the last five minutes of the movie. I won't say what it involves, but the musical montage completely ruins the tone of the rest of the movie.

That's not to say the movie doesn't have some good moments. I really enjoyed the medieval take on high school. I also really enjoyed the princesses' revolt. Still, there just wasn't enough good stuff to make up for the bad.

Children will like SHREK THE THIRD and it is worth watching if you've seen the first two SHREK films. However, if you're looking for the same style, humor, and tone that made the first two SHREK movies such a joy to watch, you won't find it here.",1186963200,2,2503,4.530973451327434

I am glad that was all I spent. Kids may like this one, but as an adult....ZILCH! If there is a SHREK 4, the writers better get on the stick!",1185235200,5,472,4.031914893617022
1573877,3,B00005JPFT,"There is nothing wrong with ""Shrek the Third."" And nothing special either. That's what I thought after watching the film, which is certainly entertaining thanks to the wonderful voice cast and funny gags, but the funny part does not include the wicked and clever humor of the first ""Shrek"" film.

Perhaps its weak story and unmemorable new characters ought to be blamed. Well, to be honest, the idea of a young, spoiled boy `Artie' who is brought from a high school by Shrek to be the king of ""Far, Far Away"" is not as interesting as Prince Charming, now second-rate actor playing himself on stage, returning as villain to take over the kingdom. The third ""Shrek"" tries to incorporate the first plot into the second while the latter has much more potential as the background story for side-splitting comedy.

And we are told that Shrek is going to be a father, and through the unlikely friendship with rebellious Artie the green ogre learns to be one. That is not a bad idea, I admit, but at the same time it shows that ""Shrek,"" both its characters and story, are now getting closer to the world and its values (Disney, for instance) which the original ""Shrek"" was poking fun at so effectively.

In fact, funny as they are, the jokes in ""Shrek the Third"" have become more like familiar types that can be seen elsewhere. They borrow bits from ""King Arthur"" story (including retired Merlin, voiced by Eric Idle), bits from ""losers"" of the fables (such as Captain Hook), bits from ""princesses"" of famous tales (like Cinderella), but the film's script fails to develop any of these ideas.

""Shrek the Third"" is not a bad film. It is just average. But ""average"" is not something that we expect from Shrek and these lovable characters.",1184284800,2,1729,4.696369636963697
1573878,5,B00005JPFT,"Shrek the Third is not just an animation. It is a warm, hilarious movie that sees the growing up of Shrek and Fionna. While Shrek the original is about true romance, the Second is about meeting the parents and the Third is about getting ready to be a parent.

In terms of characters, the duo of the donkey and the cat, royal to Shrek as always, is fun to watch. Prince Charming has a wicked voice (Rupert Everett) and such beautiful hair! The greater emphasis of the girl power and action scenes - Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty - produce even more humour and excitement. In terms of animation, Princess Fionna is more beautiful than ever. Somehow her green face, big nose and plus size combined exudes real beauty. Her frown, her gaze and smile grab attention. In terms of storyline, there are gripping moments that may result in a tear or two - the last words of King Frog, the bond between Shrek and a young King-in-waiting, the downfall of Prince Charming.

I can't say Shrek the Third outdo the previous two. All I can say is that it is a natural extension of its predecessors, providing as much entertainment and warmth. It feels good to see how the characters grow up and bond together. In terms of technical development, it also evolves to be more advanced and fluid. Prince Charming and the Queen mother can pass as real people if one doesn't look closely. You won't come out of the cinema disappointed.",1183852800,,1424,4.580392156862745

The Arthurian myths are only barely touched despite the presence of Arthur and Merlin.  I think they dropped the ball with that one.  I laughed at a few scenes with the Gingerbread Man, but overall this one lacked the charm of the other films.  Maybe the characters are getting stale, or maybe the writing wasn't up to snuff.  I will probably buy this one to go with the first two, but on its' own it is a toss up.",1183680000,3,722,4.195652173913044

1573960,3,B00005JPFT,"Everyone has to see Shrek the Third. Why? Because they love the original, so they have to see what happens next. That's what I do! It's the norm. But this volume in the 'Shrek' francise was a little more sour than sweet.

First with the bad: Joke Quality
Now, I've said this before and I'll say it again. Jokes for kids are NOT just fart and burp jokes! I am currently 12 years old, and I find it very degrading that I fall under the category of a 'kid' and not a 'teen'. A burp or fart every once in a while is okay, but every 6  or 7 minutes!? The writers at Dreamworks really need to remember that other children besides 7 year olds will be coming to the film and will not laugh at these jokes! There were also a lot of suggestive jokes in the movie that were there for older teenagers or adults. I, knowing what most of them meant, found it very uncomfortable sitting next to my parents while the innuendo jokes played on the screen. I think that there are too many jokes that kids will not understand. Pixar, for instance, has mastered the art of making jokes that both children and adults (and me!) will laugh at, most of them with witty one-liners and physical comedy: and very little suggestive humor! Hooray!

Another ""Ehhh..."" Quality: Character Development
If you introduce new characters, you have to make them exciting, thought provoking, emotionally deep, and easy to relate to. How many new characters were there? 1...2...3...4...5...6!!!! Four (!SPOILERS!) new princesses all arrive, pleasantly funny and witty: A clueless Cinderella, a cynical Snow White, a sleepy (DUH!) Sleeping Beauty, and an evil Rapunzel. They are fortunately fun characters, and they offer great jokes. Strangely, none of them are married...that's just a little confusing. No, it's not them that I'm worried about. Nor am I worried about a very strange Merlin who I enjoyed a lot. (""No, I can't teleport you off to a distant land. How about a hug instead?"") It's Arthur (Artie) that I'm throughly confused about. If you get a new character, it's your job to make them interesting and deep. Artie wasn't deep! He's a mysterious character. You can safely say that he is only ever show two emotions: happiness and anger. Nothing in between. I did stare at him on the screen, however. Not because of intrest, but because he looks exactly (in the face) like a girl in my class. I also had a dream that Artie was married to the little mermaid's daughter and defeated a very fat Davy Jones. Confused? I am.

A Questionable Subject: The Plot
When I took my two friends (who are twins) to see Shrek the Third, I had already seen it. One of the twins commented that (quote) ""It's funny, but if you analize the story, the plot needs a lot of work."" I laughed. It was just like her to say that. But as I thought about it more and more, the plot WAS bad. It's like the makers just cooked up a burnt movie and coated it with delicious jokes to hide the foul taste of the real movie. Why did Charming need to put on a play? Who was Artie's father? Why are guards so gullible? These questions and more poured into my head! The plot jumps around and is pretty easy to follow, but it leaves you asking 'why?'.

The Good: Animation
While sterile at times, the animation was pretty darn good for a Dreamworks movie. The landscapes and the new areas around Far Far Away were rich to look at. Some characters did lack some style, but the animation is better than that of the first Shrek movie. What about Shrek 2, you ask? Not as good. As good as a Pixar film? Now, let's not hope for miracles. The animation does make it very enjoyable.

All in all, Shrek the Third is pretty much just okay. There are some funny laughs, like a hilarious scene when Shrek is trying to talk to Artie in 'hip' teenage lingo. Go and see it for the scenery and to see Shrek triumph again.

Sincerely,

~Dapplewing~",1183420800,4,3862,4.4758522727272725
1573961,4,B00005JPFT,"SHREK THE THIRD offers some interesting crossroads for our favorite green ogre (Michael Myers). With Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) frog father on his deathbed, Shrek has had to serve as king of Far Far Away in the interim.  And uneasy lies the crown.  We have some knee-slapping good times watching Shrek to his level-best to be the king to the people, but even an ogre with a good heart just isn't cut out to be the king.  He messes up nearly everything he dies, and he stinks at being the king.  Shrek is the first to admit this.

Thankfully, Eddie Murphy is back as Donkey and Antonio Banderas returns as Puss In Boots. The movie just wouldn't have been the same without them. Their constant bickering and commentary helped move that plot and the characters along quickly. Plus they got some of the funniest lines in the movie.

Prince Charming returns as the villain in this one. The opener showing him working dinner theater in a low level pub is just hilarious. The effort so fits the character, and so does all the grief he takes at the hands of the audience. Of course, he's trying to exorcize his demons by starring in a play where he triumphs over Shrek, which is what he thinks he should have done in the first place.

Then, and I'm going to use a line here that was painfully obvious in the movie that was never used, Fiona's father croaks (he's a frog, remember?). But before he does, actually after several false alarms, he tells Shrek that there is one other heir to the kingdom of Far Far Away: a young boy named Arthur.

Shrek resolves to go find Arthur and crown the boy king. All Shrek wants to do, all Shrek ever wants to do, is get back to his beloved swamp and get on with sharing his life with Fiona. But when he boards the ship to begin his voyage, Fiona tells him she is pregnant. It's all too much for Shrek. The nightmare he has about having ogre children is absolutely side-splitting. Not only that, but the movie double dips on the whole nightmare premise and caught me flat-footed on one of the quick twists.

In the meantime, back in the heart of villainy, Prince Charming retreats to a pub where all the evil characters in the fairy tales hang out and begrudge their existence. The scene where Charming rallies the troops really works. I was ready to vote for him myself.

After that, we're treated to a series of eye-popping adventures as Shrek goes back to high school to get Artie, which is how Arthur is known among his peers. Shrek also discovers that Arthur is the much-maligned prey of the school bullies and butt of all practical jokes. No one likes him.

With nothing there to stay for, Arthur decides to join Shrek and go back to be the king. Along the way Shrek ends up playing the father role to Arthur, which could have been predicted but still played well.

With the end of the movie in sight, everything is up for grabs. The visual comedy in the combat scenes is amazing. The twists and turns the plot makes as it follows a much-trod path are brilliant. It's the little things in the Shrek films that add up to big laughs.  Like the pay-for-play window Pinocchio dances in while Shrek is trying to get information about the location of Fiona. Like Arthur throwing himself on the ground and crying his eyes out to get Merlin to help them get home. Like Donkey, while possessed by Puss In Boots, when he tries to make all his fur stand on end like a cat. Like Donkey's kids when they spelled out the smoke message that tells him they love him.

One of the best things to come out of left field, and there were several, was Fiona's speech to the princesses of Far Far Away to rally them into a combat force. Sleeping Beauty's attack on the tree guards at the gate to the city is simply amazing, and I found myself lifting my jaw off the floor and laughing out loud. Music is so much a part of the Shrek movies, and there's plenty of it on the soundtrack.

I always go see the Shrek movies on the big screen, and I have a hard time waiting for the DVD release so I can watch them again. Despite my attention to the screen, there's always something I miss. Plus so many of the laughs can be enjoyed over and over. Like the Gingerbread Man's Six Million Dollar Man run through the fields. I can't wait for the DVD, and I can't wait to see if there will be - hopefully - a SHREK 4.",1182988800,2,4314,4.348258706467662
1573962,4,B00005JPFT,"The first thing I want to highlight about this movie is the beautiful animation. It is a feast for the eyes and the ears. Very colorful and exciting to watch!

The second thing I would say is that the plot is substantial. Shrek is next in line for the throne of Far Far Away. But he doesn't really want to be king. So his job is to convince the next in line, a poor, self-effacing picked on young man named Arthur.

While the expectant father Shrek is off on a journey to bring Arthur back to the city, another man with evil aspirations usurps authority in the town, locking up Shrek;s wife and friends in a castle chamber.

The plot sounds pretty serious, but there are plenty of light moments, and the singing of Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die"" at Shrek's father in law's funeral was gut bustingly funny.

Like the first two Shrek movies, this one has a stellar soundtrack and plenty of star power in the voices behind the characters. I give the movie 4 stars because the plot and dialogue slows down the film's momentum. It seems that the movie makers had to struggle to get 80 minutes worth of narrative into the script.

This movie smacks of being rushed into theatres to capitalize on the previous two films success,an undeniable fact that resounds throughout the film. They definately could have done much,much better. They should have spent more time in story developement and improving the overall animation. Even the music they selected could have been better!""Live and Let Die""by Paul and Linda McCartney was,in my humble opinion,the only truly decent song in the entire film soundtrack.

Bringing King Arthur in to rule over the magical land of Far, Far Away seemed a bit of a stretch. He's not exactly a fairy-tale creature as much as he is a legendary king (real or mythical).

Shrek 4 has already been given a thumbs up, and I hope that everyone goes back to the drawing board and tries a bit harder the next time around. In the first two films they made us believe the unbelievable. This time they gave us scenes that were completely unbelievable. Prince Charming, capturing a kingdom and using theater to bring down his arch-enemy (Shrek)? Ah, no, that was just silly and uninspired.

1573968,4,B00005JPFT,"""Shrek The Third"" might lack the originality of the original film, but it's still a very good movie.  Shrek is once again put into an uncomfortable position, except this time around he isn't trying to win Fiona's heart or impress her parents.  This time he's been chosen to replace his father-in-law as the king of Far Far Away.  He quickly finds out that there is one other potential heir to the throne called Arthur.  Once he figures out where Arthur is located, Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find the boy and convince him that he should be king.  Before leaving, however, Shrek is weighed down with more pressure when he finds out that he'll soon be a dad.  While Shrek's away, Charming gathers up all of fairytale-dom's meanest villains (including Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch from ""Snow White"") and stages a successful coup to become ruler of Far Far Away.  Using Fiona and her friends as bait, Charming awaits Shrek's return in order to finish him off and become the rightful king.

I think the reason that many people dislike this film so much is that the spotlight shines considerably less on Shrek, Donkey, and Puss than it did it the previous films.  Fiona, Snow White, Cinderella, Beauty (of ""Beauty and the Beast""), Rapunzel and Sleeping Beauty all get a decent amount of camera time.  Lesser sidekicks like Pinocchio and Gingey also take the camera off of Shrek.  Even Charming gets ample screentime along with his fellow villains.  Does this make the film any better or worse than the others?  Not in my opinion.  In fact, the princesses add quite a bit of humor to the film (not to mention a sweet action sequence set to a cover of Heart's ""Barracuda"").  Charming and his companions also offer some fun moments.  The addition of two other characters, Arthur and Merlin, also give the viewer more to laugh at.

I'll agree with others who stated that the fart jokes and other sophomoric humor can be excessive, but no more than in the other films.  In fact, jokes like that got the children laughing more than in the other two films which, in my opinion, had more humor for the adults than this sequel.

All of the original voice talents make it back for the film, and a few new voices are added as well.  These include Justin Timberlake, Eric Idle, and a few old SNLers.  It's nice to see that SNL's castmates stick so close together.

Overall, this film is better suited for the youngsters when compared to the other films.  However, that doesn't mean that the adults in the audience miss out on any of the fun.

1574064,4,B00005JPFT,"Bringing back the beloved, convivial green ogre, ""Shrek The Third"" neatly concludes the supremely entertaining trilogy. Introducing a slew of new twists on classic storybook characters, and a multitude of priceless pop culture references, this film proves that the third time's a charm. Unbelievably realistic animation, running gags and spoofs of popular movies along with a brilliantly upbeat soundtrack ensure this crowd-pleaser will delight the whole family. And the Gingerbread Man never gets old.

Shrek and Princess Fiona are planning to go back to the comforts of their swamp when all of a sudden the frog King (John Cleese) croaks. Forced to either assume the throne or track down the last remaining heir, a boy named Arthur, Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots embark on a mission to locate the young hopeful. Meanwhile the unscrupulous Prince Charming amasses a group of dastardly storybook villains to take over the land of Far Far Away. Fiona must gather her princess friends including Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty to save their overthrown kingdom. Will Shrek bring back the next heir? Will Fiona rescue her people? Will there be a Shrek 4?

For the third installment of the Shrek franchise, the distinctive characters really drive the plot. Almost a direct sequel to Shrek 2, the story picks up shortly after, employs most of the same personae, and revolves around a comparable plotline and the same villain, Prince Charming. Despite the story's familiarity, the grand assortment of characters is still entertaining to watch. Puss in Boots returns, and although he mainly reuses his best gags, including the wide-eyed begging glare, Antonio Banderas and the ingenious script ensure that he steals every scene he's in. Donkey is his usual annoying self, although here he's been toned down since the second film. And of course the Gingerbread Man is back, who is so risible that he deserves his own spin-off so we can enjoy his undoubtedly psychedelic solo adventures.

Movie references and pop culture are a huge part to the Shrek franchise. ""The Third"" features spoofs of Rosemary's Baby, an unbelievably witty nightmare sequence, and homage to buster Keaton's collapsing wall stunt in which he remains standing through an open window. Dozens of one-liner jokes and running gags emphasize pop-culture and famous clichs. At times it seems as if quirky quips comprise the entirety of the film and that if all the non-related jokes were removed, a movie might not exist beneath it. Certainly more interesting here and now, where a lot of the references are influential and relevant, the Shrek films will always be good family fun; their magic, however, might fade with the popularity of the subjects they mimic.

Technically and visually, the Shrek films continually advance. Amazing, eye-popping graphics grace the screen, with ultra-realistic textures, shading and environments, as well as fluid humanlike movements and nearly flawless animation. Hilarious character designs come to vivid life with the stunning combination of aesthetic mediums and devices. Once again an upbeat and popular soundtrack garnishes the production and hilariously placed full-scale song-and-dance sequences enhance nearly every scene.

Shrek 4 is already in the works, and while we certainly don't need it, if Dreamworks Animation keeps up the same fast-paced blend of humor, adventure and role-model-morals, it can't do us any harm. Shrek the Third perfectly matches its predecessors and, while equally as preachy, the entertainment value always remains high.

1574065,4,B00005JPFT,"The last thing Shrek (Mike Myers) wanted to do was be the king of Far Far Away Land. However, when Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) dad, and current ruler, King Harold (John Cleese), retires, he has no choice but to fill in. However, he has another option: recruit the king's nephew, Arthur Pendragon (Justin Timberlake), an outcast who lives in Worcestershire. With help from sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), as well as Arthur's wizard teacher Merlin (Eric Idel), they convince Arthur to go back to Far Far Away Land. Of course, while all this is happening, the jilted Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) has returned to take over the kingdom with the help of some fairy tale villains (including Deadwood's Ian McShane as Captain Hook), leaving Fiona, her mother (Julie Andrews), and a quartet of famous fairty tale princesses (including Cheri Oteri, Maya Rudolph, Amy Poehler, Amy Sedaris), to fend for themselves.

For newbies of the ""Shrek"" franchise, what began as an animated feature film based on a classic novel became a Monty Python-esque gigglefest that poked fun at fairy tale fables and Disney animated features, but was played straight enough that it became an enjoyable film. It was also, in my opinion, the first family-oriented animated film that adults can enter and not come out dirty. With that, sequels were made, and now we've made it to part three. So how did our heroes hold up?

With ""Shrek the Third"", directors Chris Miller and Raman Hui still have fun with the material. This time, they're throwing plenty of objects into the blender. Third has more characters, and a slew of popular actors and actresses to voice them (along with Timberlake, Idle, Sedaris, and ""Saturday Night Live""'s popular comediennes, ""The Office""'s John Krasinski plays Sir Lancelot, Judd Apatow regular Seth Rogen plays a ship captain, talk show host Regis Philbin plays one of Cinderella's ugly stepsisiters, and Disney voice actress Susan Blakeslee plays Snow White's evil queen).

Eddie Murphy and Antoino Banderas are still pulling out all the bells and whistles with their characters. Especially Murphy, who still gets plenty of laughs as Donkey. Banderas still skewers his Zorro persona and steals plenty of scenes, if not run off with them. Everybody here manages to give splendid line readings, including Justin Timberlake (no surprise, he was the only good thing in ""Alpha Dog"").

And note to Amy Poehler - I think it's time to leave ""SNL"", considering Lorne Michaels is limiting your best intentions, which are on full display in this film. Same for Maya Rudolph, though her character somehow disappears without reason.

Third isn't always a day at the picnic. The shock humor is still in full effect, though it ain't as sharp as it was in previous installments (a certain filthy word is censored through a blowhorn; been there, done that), the pop culture spoofs aren't clever, and Rupert Everett's line readings are a little flat. But with a bouncy soundtrack (including The Who's ""Live and Let Die"", Led Zepplin's ""Immigrant Song"", and Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas belting out their version of ""Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)"") and sharp animation ruling again, there's still plenty of magic left underneath those filthy ogre armpits. Maybe for the next film, allow some room for ""MadTV"" alums (Alex Borstein, Artie Lange, Nicole Parker, Will Sasso, Aries Spears, Nicole Sullivan, and Debra Wilson are just a few recommendation).",1180051200,,3483,5.0821678321678325
1574156,3,B00005JPFT,"Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the ailing Frog King (John Cleese), Fiona's father and leader of Far, Far Away. Yes, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) are around to provide support and to help them adapt to the routine of acting as monarchy, but they are both uncomfortable in this new role. When Shrek learns of a cousin who could become the new ruler, he sets off on a journey to bring Artie (Justin Timberlake) back from Worcestshire High School. Just as he leaves, Fiona lets him know that she is pregnant and this leads to Shrek having some nightmares during the journey. Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), now an actor playing himself in dinner theater, learns of the possible shift in leadership and rounds up all of the other villains to help him take over Far, Far Away enlisting Captain Hook (Ian McShane), the Wicked Witch, Gepetto and Rumplestiltskin, among others, to help out. They attack the castle just as Fiona is having a baby shower with the other princesses, including Snow White (Amy Poehler, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri, TV's ""Saturday Night Live""), Cinderella (Amy Sedaris, TV's ""Strangers with Candy""), Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph, TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") and her mother, the Queen (Julie Andrews). Shrek finds Artie, a teenager who is the butt of all the other kid's jokes including the dashing Lancelot (John Krasinski, TV's ""The Office""), but convinces him to return to Far, Far Away. But the journey takes too long and they pay a visit to Merlin (Eric Idle), who has been bitten by the self-empowerment bug and only wants people to find their inner self.

The key to any memorable animated film is if it manages to keep the adults entertained at the same time. Those adults have to bring the tots to the theater, why shouldn't they have some fun. The films that manage to capture this formula will remain in our consciousness for decades because the kids will continue to watch them as they grow up and show them to their kids. The first two films managed to do this, employing very good computer animation with enough jokes for the kids and the adults.

""Shrek the Third"", the newest entry from DreamWorks, follows the same formula as the previous two films, but only employs about half the jokes. Half the jokes make it less funny and less memorable. ""Third"" proves that not all threes are a charm. Don't get me wrong. It is an okay film, just nowhere near as good as the previous two films. This is definitely a franchise of diminishing returns.

All of the great voice talent returns. Mike Myers, who I don't believe has done anything since the last ""Shrek"" film, returns as the ogre from the swamp who is now married to Fiona and must try to fit into the role of a Royal, for her sake. He has difficulty, but keeps trying because he knows how important it is for Fiona, his wife and true love. When he finds out she is pregnant, he begins to have nightmares of rearing children, afraid of how his life will change. But this seems like a rather tame outing for Myers. There is only one moment when he is given any latitude to create something resembling `ad lib ` and these jokes are pretty dated. Throughout, he merely reacts to the other characters, providing little laughter of his own.

Cameron Diaz returns as Fiona, the princess who is also an ogre and the love of Shrek's life. For much of the film, she is in a dungeon or surrounded by other characters, played by funnier actresses, merely highlighting the lack of laughs Fiona creates and the lack of character Diaz is able to create. She may be pretty, but she isn't a very memorable voice actor.

Eddie Murphy returns as Donkey, Shrek's sidekick. He is amusing and provides some laughs. He and Dragon have married and have children, strange donkey-dragon kids who fly around and set things on fire. Donkey always pops up and says the wrong thing at the wrong time. That's his shtick and it wears a little thin. Antonio Banderas returns as Puss, the best addition from ""Shrek 2"", who now serves as an advisor to Shrek. He has a few opportunities to make us laugh. I'm not really revealing anything by telling you that Donkey and Puss switch bodies during the course of the story (this is revealed in the trailer) and this leads to a few laughs.

Ruper Everett plays Charming and has clearly let his quest for the throne take him around the bend. Now, reduced to playing himself in dinner theater, he seeks revenge and will stop at nothing to get it.

John Cleese and Julie Andrews return as the King and Queen. Both add the necessary stateliness to their characters, and Cleese manages to add some humor to his role, but these moments are short-lived.

Eric Idle is the best new addition to this film. He plays Merlin, a Merlin who appears to have been to one too many Robert Bly pow-wows or perhaps taken one too many mushrooms. He combines some mystical mumbo jumbo, new age-y, touchy feely perspectives to our stereotypical view of the wizard adding some truly twisted comical moments.

The rest of the major additions really don't add a lot of memorable moments to the film. Justin Timberlake plays Artie, or Arthur, the cousin of the King and the teenager Shrek desperately seeks to take over the throne. We recognize it is Timberlake's voice, but he doesn't add anything to the role another actor couldn't have done. Moreover, there are zero laughs from the character. The funniest part of this character is watching how the filmmakers have adapted the high school memories of our nightmares into the medieval, storybook setting. John Krasinski, from ""The Office"", plays Lancelot, Artie's main rival at Worcestshire High, and the character is a welcome addition, but Krasinski doesn't add anything spectacular to the role either. You never say ""Oh, that's John Krasinski"", as we have with Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas or Mike Myers. Ian McShane, from ""Deadwood"", plays Captain Hook, and the role is funny, but again, we don't get anything particularly memorable from McShane's performance. Hook likes to play the piano, so he brings one with him everywhere he goes, including when he is supposed to be leading a fight against our heroes. It is an amusing, but never fully explored joke and character trait.

The problem with ""Shrek the Third"" is that it just isn't that funny. Yes, there are some funny moments at the high school and in a scene when Charming attempts to create a play that will both make him a star and the king, but the film has long stretches with no laughs. The first two films featured fast-paced, laugh a minute segments that left us laughing and wanting more. ""Third"" just leaves us wanting more.

The first two films included many, many funny pop culture references, a practice that seems to have been almost completely abandoned. Far, Far Away looks a lot like downtown Beverly Hills complete with chain stores and the films have had a lot of fun creating medieval versions of ""Starbucks"" and ""Footlocker"", to name just a few. These moments are almost non-existent in this entry. A quick pan across Far, Far Away shows the same chains and a brief shot of a logo on a box provides a quick laugh, but these jokes are almost expected. Why didn't the filmmakers take a few moments to include them and help to make them more memorable?

Hopefully, ""Shrek 4"", which has already been announced, will return the film to its roots, the laughter and the greatness of the first two entries.",1179878400,2,7479,4.7138485080336645
1574157,2,B00005JPFT,"Shrek, like Harry Potter, is one of those entertainment vehicles that transcended the gap between target marketing groups.  Harry Potter is appealing to both kids and adults, making it a huge hit.  It's a difficult balancing act that is threatened by its own popularity...it's very possible for a name or product to be a victim of its own success, thereby turning off future readers/viewers.

Shrek's hit that point with Shrek the Third.

For kids, Shrek was fun to watch.  The characters are either cuddly or blubbery, but never really mean (even the dragon's kind of cute).  Shrek himself, supposedly a horrible ogre, looks like a green pile of Playdoh.  He's not all that threatening, and he's not supposed to be.  And since Shrek is gross, he's got a certain prepubescent boy appeal.

For adults, Shrek was packed with twists on old fairytales, winking nods to familiar voice actors in unfamiliar roles (I'm apparently the only one who got some of the Eddie Murphy jokes in the second Shrek film), and plenty of riffs on movies.  Keeping a film amusing for the little ones without aggravating adults, or amusing for the adults without boring the kids, is high art.  The path is littered with the corpses of movies who couldn't balance it well (see Chicken Little).

By the time we reach Shrek the Third, the producers had to figure out which he wanted to do: make a movie that's filled with more riffs on fairytales, or actually treat Shrek as a real personality who grows and develops.  Shrek 2 managed this amazing feat by shifting locales: Shrek went to the equivalent of Hollywood, fertile ground for humorous allegories and wisecracks.  He was also getting to know his in-laws, and certainly all the adults in the audience could appreciate the hilarity that inevitably ensued as two very different groups of people tired to get along.

So Shrek the Third tackles next logical step of having a baby.

The lovable cast of ridiculous misfit fairytale characters is barely in evidence.  Taking up the task of mocking fairytale tropes are fairytale villains.  Sort of.  We've got the Evil Queen from Snow White, Hook from Peter Pan, some dwarves, the Headless Horseman, and a lot of evil trees.  I don't know about you, but I don't think of evil trees when I think of fairytale villains. And oh yeah, for some reason one of the bad guys is a cyclops.  Can't forget the cyclopes. They couldn't come up with more recognizable fairytale villains?  THIS is the most hilarious it gets?

In the middle of this villainous rebellion, led by Prince Charming, Shrek goes off on a quest to find an heir to the king. The heir's a punk named Arthur (as in, King).  Only he lives in a fairytale version of high school.  Which would be really funny, if Shrek actually stayed there.  High school jokes were a potential for comedy goldmine, like the Hollywood jokes.  But alas, it's not to be.  Shrek leaves, with Donkey and Puss in tow.

Speaking of which, Donkey is now utterly extraneous.  Puss is hilarious and entertaining, Donkey is barely relevant.  With so many characters, it's getting crowded in the Shrekiverse.  And me being a cat owner has nothing to do with my bias towards Puss, I'm sure.

The movie wraps up with a Grrl Power counterattack, and finally we see the Shrek we came to see.  Watching all the fairy princesses gather together to use their unique powers to finally save themselves is great.  The Snow White scene made the audience laugh.  But the rest of the princesses are barely used, and we're once again back to Adultsville.

In the end, we get a nice little sermon about everyone getting along, about how we shouldn't marginalize people by making them out to be villains, and about Shrek accepting that he's finally going to be a dad.  Ironically, my wife is six months pregnant, so this movie was a lot more relevant to me than I expected.  Worries about being a good father?  Check. Concerned that the kids will be too much to handle?  Check.  Not sure how domestic life will become part of your own manly personality?  Check.  Man, Shrek really was hilarious...I was laughing out loud at several parts!

Then I noticed I was the only one.

You see, there weren't that many dads in the audience.  It was stuffed to the rafters with mothers and their children though.  And those kids were squirming through much of the movie, because...because dad jokes are funny to dads and dads-to-be.

The movie ends with Shrek asking Fiona.  ""The kids are in bed...what do you want to do now?"" That's a decidedly adult joke, but don't worry...they end up falling asleep instead.

Yep. Shrek seems a bit tired.",1179878400,8,4616,4.7218045112781954
1574158,2,B00005JPFT,"I'm a 23 year old, and I was a huge fan of Shrek, a pretty big fan of Shrek 2, but I wasn't impressed by the Shrek the Third trailers.  Shrek the Third has very little plot and no true character development.  It's stagnant.  It really feels like a collection of all the deleted scenes from Shrek and Shrek 2.  Each scene is over the top and becomes irritating before it finishes.  Many of the characters phase in and out of character.  Worst of all, the movie seems no longer to have an adult appeal.  It's a kids movie with a story so stupid you'd have to be a kid to not notice.",1179792000,12,580,4.079646017699115
1574159,3,B00005JPFT,"After the brilliance of the first two films, the third is just disappointing.  The animation is outstanding, of course...far superior to most other CGI films coming out these days.  The voice work is quite good.  Even the idea for the plot...with Shrek running off to find young Arthur to fill the throne he himself doesn't want...is a decent skeleton.

But the movie just isn't as funny!  There were some fairly long stretches where is realized, ""Hey, I haven't laughed in quite a long time.""  There are lots of chuckles of amused familiarity...it's always fun to see Puss in Boots do his big, sad-eyed bit.  The supporting roles of Gingerbread Man, Pinocchio, the pigs, etc. are fun.  But the film doesn't surprise or delight.  The first was so great because we'd never seen a film like it and the characters were so fresh and fun.  #2 simply stepped up the hilarity quotient (and added the brilliantly hilarious Antonio Banderas).  But #3 just misses.  At one point, Puss and Donkey exchange bodies.  Haven't we seen similar ideas before?  Didn't Donkey become a Stallion?

Also, some of the jokes just weren't funny.  Playing ""Live and Let Die"" at the Frog King's funeral was weird...not funny.  The climactic battle between Charming and his gang vs. Shrek and his friends was not exciting, not funny and not visually interesting.  VERY anticlimatic.

For me, the best scenes took place at Arthur's high-school...a very Hogwarts sort of establishment.  It poked fun at the Harry Potter stories, at ""teen-clique"" movies like MEAN GIRLS and at the Arthurian legend.

But for a movie that took 3 years to make...it felt a little lazy.  I'll keep going to SHREK films for now...but I hope 4 picks it up again!!!",1179792000,3,1711,4.8477508650519034

""Shrek 2"" didn't solve this problem, but dodged it through sheer, unrestrained (if also unfocused) energy, and an appealing new sidekick for Shrek (Puss in Boots).  Shrek 3, a curiously low-energy effort, neither avoids nor solves the problem.  The result is the typical exhausted-franchise work product: a tired, boring, surprisingly conventional movie, with none of the zing of the original.  The chief villains are the writers, as the story line is flat and unoriginal, but the lack of inspiration is everywhere evident, even in the animation.

1574163,4,B00005JPFT,"Shrek is one of the great film characters.  All too often it seems as if many reviewers saying they don't like this movie because it's 'lost some of it's charm.'

I find that to be a complete copout.  If you didn't like it, then give true reasons why not.

Shrek (Mike Myers)is one of the few film charcters who actually change and evolve through a trilogy of adventures.  But at the same time, he always keeps thos important to him closest to him.

The same aspects of the adventures may not be in the third going around.  Perhaps the writers are simply running out of fairy tale characters to add into their whimsical tales.  True, perhaps the villians are not quite up to snuff compared to the great talent of Lord Farquaad himself (John Lithgow.) And admittedly some of the jokes are questionable.  However, the wonderful thing about these type of jokes is the kids don't truly understand them and they typically let it slide. (at least my kids do.)

The plot simply involves Shrek being the next heir to the throne of Far Far Away.  At heart, though, he's just a simple ogre.  All he ever wanted to be was an ogre.  He learned in the first movie he's an ogre with heart.  So, to be true to his heart, and his true love, he decides to go on another journey to find the only OTHER heir, 'Artie' played suprisingly well by Justin Timberlake. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justified/dp/B00006JO4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justified</a>

Along for the ride are friends [...] In Boots (Antonia Bandares) and Donkey (the great Eddie Murphy).  Of course, these two are more comic relief than anying, but they're more than willing to get their hands (or paws/hooves) dirty when they're truly needed.

Their misson does involve thwarting bullies at a distant fantasy high school, convincing a whiny loser his rightful place in the world, and defeating the egomaniacal Prince Charming (played by Rupert Everett).

What's great about the movie is the core of the entire story.  The lesson we all learn is the fact that the world changes, and we're powerless to stop it.  While Artie is intent on not becoming a king, Shrek is desperately nervous about an impending growing family.  Neither of these things is controlable, but life finds a way to help us cope.

Overall, I think the movie was quite funny.  It is entertaining not only for myself, but my family as well.  In the end, isn't that what truly makes a good film?",1179619200,,2458,4.8253588516746415
1574164,2,B00005JPFT,"The worn path of `Shrek The Third' reeks of obligatory sequel and becomes 'Shrek' The Mediocre. `Shrek' 1 and 2 were charming, yet crudely funny, providing a remarkably dynamic and well-rounded entertainment. Much of the humor is lost: Crude without funny falls flat. With a noticeable diminution of charm, even the lovable characters seem worn thin this trek. Often the lines are lame insults or tired clichs. Episodic and sometimes random, Shrek seems to have run out of gas.

The plot is planted solidly enough. The Frog King, on his death lily pad, croaks his last, making Shrek (Myers) his heir. Shrek, the Reluctant, looks for Arthur (Timberlake) attending a land remote from ""Far, Far Away"" to take his place. Meanwhile, Feona (Diaz) is expecting their own family heir, providing a dream sequence about baby fluids, and a chance for another sequel. Strengthening the conflict, however, is Prince Charming (Everett), a washed up dinner theater actor for the rotten tomatoes crowd. He reaps his revenge at a rough bar of broken dreams summoning Snow White's witch and other misfits to challenge Shrek and his cohorts.

To be fair, a new magician does have Puss N' Boots (Banderas) and Donkey (Murphy) ""trading places"" in one scene, but these laughs are the exception. (Indeed both characters are the core merits for this sequel, and some sight gags live up to 'Shrek' legend.)  The satire is lost with stereotypical jokes at Arthur's Worcestershire School, and the same Zen wizard waxing about ""serentity circles"" and ""Primal (Scream) Therapy"". (Lame)  Remarkable animation and past characterization only partly save this sequel.

Otherwise, we can only hope a new `Shrek' movie will be more inspired and not based on deadlines. ('Shrek' [The Magnificent] 4 1/2 *'s; 'Shrek 2' [The Admirable] 3 1/2*'s )",1179619200,9,1808,5.094594594594595

All the voices are back.  Timberlake did a great job.  The songs are only OK, though.  I liked the songs better in the second movie, especially the castle storming scene.

1574267,2,B00005JPFT,"It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the ""Shrek"" series, since ""Shrek the Third"" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike.  In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.

In this edition, Shrek's father-in-law, the frog king of the realm of Far Far Away, bequeaths his crown to Shrek on his deathbed unless the reluctant ogre can find a distant heir (the young Arthur) to take his place.  Shrek, filled with doubts about his own ability to rule the kingdom, heads off with his faithful companions, Donkey and Puss In Boots, to find the boy and bring him back to the castle where he will assume his rightful place on the throne.  Meanwhile, the vain, conniving Prince Charming has decided to enlist the aid of all the villains of the kingdom to mount a coup and proclaim himself king of the land.

As I reckon them, there are about five hearty laughs in ""Shrek the Third,"" and at least four of them come in the opening scene of the film (a very funny parody of third-rate dinner theater).  Unfortunately, it's all pretty much downhill from there, as one ostensibly comic line after another crashes and burns, leaving us with little but the gorgeous backdrops and seamless animation to hold our attention.  Regarding the latter point, it must be stated that movie animators have certainly come a long way in perfecting the facial expressions of their characters, but what is the point of such a technological advancement if it is placed in the service of as dismal a script as Andrew Adams, Howard Gould, Jeffrey Price, Peter S. Seaman, J. David Stern, David N. Weiss, and Jon Zack have concocted here?  Somehow, you know you're in trouble when no fewer than seven writers have a hand in a screenplay, but couldn't at least one of them have come up with a funny joke or two while they were hammering it all out?  Moreover, the story itself is dull and plodding and even the ""Shrek"" trademark of piling on clever pop culture references falls flat in this instance (and having Medieval teenagers blabbing away in already-dated Valley Girl lingo just doesn't cut it).

Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas still provide yeoman service as the voices of Donkey and Puss In Boots, respectively, but even they can't keep the whole enterprise from feeling as if blockbuster rigor mortis has set in.  Unlike the two earlier films in the series, ""Shrek the Third"" feels less the product of a magic spell than of a divine curse.",1179619200,6,2858,4.741935483870968
1574268,4,B00005JPFT,"MOVIE: The summer of thirds continues. We've had Spider-Man 3 so far, which is in the running for biggest disappointment of the year, the third Pirates film is coming up and should be a blast, and we have Ocean's 13 and The Bourne Ultimatum rounding out the group of thirds. This monster month of May continues with Shrek The Third, and thankfully we have our first enjoyable film of the summer. Fans of the first two movies will flock to this one in great anticipation. The movie itself is a treat and will please kids and adults alike, but unfortunately the movie suffers from sequelitis in that it has lost some steam.

While the movie is not as fresh as the first two it does offer plenty to entertain. The jokes come flying in fast and they are funny. There is a lot of physical comedy I guess you could say, but we still have the great popular culture references. There is also tons of humor that will fly right over the younger audience and make the experience worthwhile for adults. I saw a late screening and basically the entire audience was 17 and older and the place was a laugh factory. The movie even got applause at the end. Jokes like Puss saying goodbye to his many lovers or having a line like ""You are royally . . ."" with the curse word being blocked by a foghorn should give you a good belly laugh. In fact I felt that this movie was less orientated towards kids than the first two. The first two films had their fair share of farts and burps, but this installment toned back on it. The only kid orientated aspect of the film is having Justin Timberlake play Arthur, heir to the throne. Except that Arthur is in high school, so we get a scene of what school life would be like in the world of Shrek. I think a problem that some people will have is that there are so many characters now that it throws off the focus of the story. Characters like Pinocchio and Gingy serve simply as cutaways for jokes, while they are still hilarious it does lower the quality of the film when stacked up to what we've seen before.

The biggest difference worth mentioning is the absence of director Andrew Adamson who made his start with the first two. Adamson's direction was superb and is the reason why the first two are just great comedic family films. Since he is busy with his Narnia empire he wasn't able to direct Shrek The Third. Adamson did do the story but he didn't do the screenplay. The result is a notable lack of structure and timing for the jokes and the story as a whole. It seems as if we are dropped in the middle of everything; there is no set up. Alas this is a sequel, but I think some establishing of the story couldn't have hurt. The other thing I had a problem with was the unbelievable overuse of popular songs. Some songs felt out of place and some just didn't work at all. There were too many songs and not enough score. Harry Gregson-Williams has been part of this franchise since the beginning and he returned to score the third one despite Andrew Adamson leaving. It feels like that they drown out his score completely with all the songs. Granted you don't go see a movie like this for the score, but I think the score played a big part in the first two and I hardly recall noticing most of it this time around. Thankfully he will be getting a score release in June so I can sit aside and give it a listen then.

ACTING: In the voice department everything is on par with the previous two. The actors give the same enthusiasm to their characters as before and once again Antonio Banderas shines with Puss In Boots. Eric Idle is probably the best addition to the cast as Merlin the wizard. Idle plays Merlin after he's had a nervous breakdown, and the character steals some of the funniest moments in the film.

BOTTON LINE: The bottom line here is that Shrek The Third is not as good as the first two, but it's still better than most animated films out there. I laughed a lot and found it to be worth my time as a summer fare. The lack of focus and structure plus the overuse of popular music didn't ruin the experience, but I do think it shows that when you change directors there is in fact a difference. Go see Shrek The Third and have a good time, it was certainly more enjoyable than Spider-Man 3 that's for sure.",1179619200,,4251,4.329987452948557
1574269,3,B00005JPFT,"Sometimes sequels are good (Spiderman III), othertimes not-so-good (X-Men III).  Regretfully, Shrek the Third is one of those not-so-good sequels.

The movies tries to live up to the quality of the first two and does score some points.  Unfortuantely, it suffers from a bad case of ""been there done that"".  You can the feeling a lot of what you see has been borrowed from the previous movies, the end result being a picture best viewed on the DVD, Comcast, or cable.

Can't win 'em all, Shrek.",1179619200,2,493,4.686046511627907
1574270,4,B00005JPFT,"Ok the crew @ Dreamworks ,is getting a little bit odd. With the newest,spoof fest in a land ""Far Far Away"":As they spin the tale of Shrek's latest ""World Wind Quest"".To find a king for ""Far Far Away"".

The movie opens not with the story book introduction,that was trade mark too the first two(*sigh*).Instead with Prince Charming telling his fantasy  happily ever after tale on stage:Complete with banging coconuts.

If a veiwer hasn't guessed by now he wants revenge,Welp-it becomes obvious When, Charming is sitting in his allyway dressing room-talking too mum's photo. For his plan too work though he needs help,and where does any fairy tale villian go too get help -""The Poision Apple ""of course. Where with a nice fluffy speach on how mistreated these poor souls are,he wins him self a small army. Complete with talking apple trees from OZ.

 Meanwhile:Shrek and Feiona are preparing too return too there lovely swamp home,but too everyone's dismay the old frog king crocs litterally. But not before telling Shrek if he doesn't want the job of beging king ,he needs too find cousin Aruther(Artie).The latter is by far the best choice. So with side kicks Donkey and Puss in tow,He sails off too find cousin Artie. Fortunally for our Adveturers Shrek didn't crisin' this ship. On Board he finds out hes going too be a daddy,this leads too some funny nightmares & worring. After docking: they find there subject, in a school that looks like a cross between classic camalot and Potter. Artie is the poor boy in the middle,of a triangle. He's the beating post for the jouist team,rejected by both nerds and airhead cheerleaders. Despite all this he still doesnt want too go ,but Shreks is ever so convincing. Once again carring some one off kicking and screaming. One ship crash latter,and a little help from  a old,esentric,poorly dressed Mr. Merlin they make it back too""Far Far Away"".

 Where: Feiona ,with the rest of the princess: Enjoying her shower. Until Charming and company- break it up. Adventually its up too Feiona and her Mom too lead the escape,retaking of the castle and rescuing of Shrek. The film closes with a more or less quite pull away from the Swamp Home. Not the Rousing (trademark)precredit song(""sigh"").The not too good song comes during credits this time.

Other old friend like Gingy,wolf ,pigs, mice,Pinoc-are back too and in there own way-they both get in the way and help out .

The Cgi-is still very much top notch and improving. The music,seems too have droped in selection and in keeping pace with the film. The story is good,has a nice moral about not giving up on your self,but maybe a bit too dark for the younger veiwers,too much revenge going on,and perhappes a bit to much adult interendu. I round it up from a shaky 3.5.",1179532800,,2761,4.805907172995781
1574271,5,B00005JPFT,"""Shrek The Third"" is great! Mike Myers (as Shrek), Eddie Murphy (as Donkey), Cameron Diaz (as Princess Fiona), and Antonio Banderas (as Puss In Boots), return as their characters from the previous ""Shrek"" sequel. The directing by Chris Miller is great. The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who also did the music to the first two ""Shrek"" movies) is great. The film editing by Michael Andrews (who also film edited ""Shrek 2"" (2004) is great. The production design by Guillaume Aretos (who also did the production design to ""Shrek 2"") is great. The art direction by Peter Zaslav is great. This is a great sequel to the original and it is faithful to the original and its sequel.",1179532800,,676,4.786324786324786
1574272,3,B00005JPFT,"Lacking the originality and the freshness of its two predecessors, Shrek The Third manages a few laughs. Mostly, the jokes are flat and childish. Shrek movies have become known for making fun and delighting their audience with an incredible movie soundtrack, yet, the third installment attempts to be mediocre and gather the attention of little kids (presumably in hopes of staying afloat long enough to earn the big bucks). The Ogre himself has less face movements (with his jaw moving but the rest of the face remaining expressionless) and Fiona is barely in the movie to make much of an impact.

The credits, however, are done incredibly well and are enjoyable to watch. If only the rest of the movie was as entertaining.",1179532800,4,724,4.8861788617886175
