I own all the live SNSD concerts and I guess they have spoiled me.  Where those are major concert events with high production values, PP comes off a little more like something filmed for TV.  It's a little rough around the edges and the sound quality/vocals are little lacking sometimes.  It just isn't on the scale of an SNSD or even Karasia.  However, I would buy it again and again, I just can't NOT own this.  What IS good is the girls of Apink, being absolutely charming and performing the songs you want to see.  There are some cute outfits and good backup dancers.  Then ending song is worth the price on it's own.  The overall packaging of this set is top rate too.",1437177600,3,792,4.326530612244898
