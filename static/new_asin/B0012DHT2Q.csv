It begins with a view of a big city. A newspaper has a lonely hearts club that finds mates. A wealthy man wants to find a bride. The editor wants a woman reporter to answer this ad for a story. People are drilling a well and need a right-of-way to access it. Roy and Frog follow the ranch owner Jerry Johnson who drives near a team of horses and causes a stampede. Jerry likes to gamble. One of his employees conspires against him. There is a celebration. Roy arrives with the Judge to talk business, but Jerry doesnt want to talk. Roy sings to the people about Back in Your Own Backyard. There is a conflict between Jerry and Roy. Jerry married Mary that morning! Jerry calls the Sheriff. The two women ask Frog to take them away. Jerry attacks Roy but loses.

Jerry speeds off, as he rounds a curve a rifle shot causes his car to go off the cliff! Roy goes to help. The assassin switches rifles with Roy. The Sheriff arrives with men. The recently fired rifle implicates Roy, but Roy rides off. The widow talks to her editor, who advises Mary to talk to the Sheriff in the morning. Lucky overhears this conversation! Roy and Frog see the women with Steve and arrive just in time. Roy talks to Mary about the right-of-way. She saw Roys rifle with another man (but doesnt realize the implications). Roy ties up Buck and questions him; he talks. The Sheriff arrives, but Buck won't talk now. Frog tells Roy what happened. Later Roy breaks jail and escapes.

Lucky Miller goes to that Ghost Town with his men and finds the two women. Roy stampedes their horses, then frees the men with Mary and her friend. Lucky gets out, they begin shooting. Can Roy rescue the two women? He hitches six horses to a wagon and they ride away. Frog joins them and fires a rifle at their pursuers, stopping some. The Sheriff and his men hear the shooting and follow. There is action in the chase! The wagon goes over the cliff into the river. The Sheriff arrests Lucky Miller. Mary signs over the right-of-way, people rejoice. Mary will share her property with the people too. She will stay until the well is brought in. There is a song about Tumbling Tumbleweeds. Frogs toothache is gone. A happy ending for the good guys.

This story packs a lot of events into this movie. Roys status varies during the movie, but we know he remains a good guy. It shows how planted evidence can make an innocent man appear guilty. This movie is better than some other Westerns in its complexity. Tumbleweeds are an imported species and not native to the Old West; like the Hereford cattle that replaced longhorn cattle.",1507334400,,2610,4.488421052631579
