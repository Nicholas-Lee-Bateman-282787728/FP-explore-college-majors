8211445,4,B000TQ9NRQ,"This is a documentary about one of the masters of brazilian music, Vinicius de Moraes. The documentary is conducted by two actors and contemporary brazilian singers which make an imaginary show, and the stories of Vinicius are retelled having his poems and songs as a starting point. Although its length (124 minutes), lovers of brasilian music in general and lovers of Vinicius particularly won't feel that the movie was that long.

The movie doesn't tell only the happy and fun parts of Vinicius' life; one of his daughters remembers the problems with money the family had and the time when Vinicius and her mother divorced. You can feel that this is an unconfortable subject, as she makes her feelings about it very clear during the interviews. There are also numerous videos of Vinicius, including footage of one of the ""Viniciadas"" he promoved at his house and touching images from the end of his life, where he is together with Toquinho and his wife.

So, why just four stars? Well, the rap segment is a failed tentative to show the social worries of Vinicius, and as it is, it just does not fit to the rest of the movie and could be deleted with no problems - although it could be included as an extra in the DVD. Adding insult to the injury, the wonderful ""Poema Enjoadinho"" (""Filhos, melhor no t-los!"") was not included on the movie, appearing just as a DVD extra feature.

Other thing that really distressed me was that the director chose not to play ""Samba da Bno"" until the end in the end credits! For me, this is the ultimate legacy and message of Vinicius de Moraes and cutting it in the half shows a lack of sensibility and respect - sensibility and respect which was so well expressed throughout the movie. And finally, Paramount could had done a better job on the DVD - there is just no sense in releasing it at 1:1.85 letterboxed, instead of anamorphic widescreen.

Despite these flaws, this movie is highly recommended for everyone who loves brasilian music.",1212105600,7,1977,4.688760806916426
