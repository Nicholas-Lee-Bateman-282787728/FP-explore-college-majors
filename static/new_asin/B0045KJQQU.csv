Yeah, there is some stuff on there that confused me for a few years, or more likely I was already confused and Ed just brought it to my attention. Nevertheless Ed is extremely intelligent, Knowledgeable, a fabulous Skagit Caster and you can learn a bunch from this video. If Eds out and around style intrigues you then go with Skagitmaster One featuring Ed Ward. Its a classic and one every video freak should have one in his library.  I can say Ed's casting style worked for me, but it wasn't because I watched his video as much as the fact that he and others helped me online and I practiced religiously for years.",1513382400,,1125,6.258064516129032
8416774,5,B0045KJQQU,great video for learning Skagit casting basics and advanced tips. Ed presents a great class informal and packed with tips and tricks. Glad I bought the DVD,1505347200,,155,4.777777777777778
8416775,4,B0045KJQQU,"The fisherman I bought this for said it is an excellent tutorial.  Sadly, somewhere in midst there is a spot where DVD is unwatchable and disc stops, but Amazon was great about returning it, so I am ordering another and hoping this will be fully viewable!",1490659200,,255,4.543478260869565
8416776,5,B0045KJQQU,Excellent tape.  Ed Ward is a master teacher.,1476230400,,45,4.625
8416777,4,B0045KJQQU,"I know Ed Ward has a large following on line and I hear he is one heck of a good fisherman but I just didn't care for this video.
His instructions are odd to me. I found youtube vid's that have done a much better job showing these casts.
One of the things that bugged me the most was how Ed always talks about the constant load on the rod during his casts. (online)
Yet when you watch him casting on the river (in this video) he always pauses during the end of the backstroke. that would lose the load on the rod i would think.
The only reason I gave him 4 stars instead of 3 is because the problem with instructions is sometimes the listeners fault more than the speaker.
I think most folks think he is the black belt of Skagit casting. I wish I was watching him live instead of a video because there's a ton of questions I would ask him.
things he didn't really cover well or not at all.
1. anchor placement. the C-spay cast were the anchor ends up is super important as well as hard to do right. Depending on where the fly ends up down stream effects where your cast will end up after the ""C"" in the C-spay.
2. trouble shooting casting problems. he did not cover any.
3. sinking tips and heavy flies can keep you from getting the fly out of the water after the ""hang down"" I end up having to do a roll cast before each C-Spay.

Bottom line is, he has other videos, and I will prob by them as well.",1432857600,2,1400,4.054151624548736
8416778,5,B0045KJQQU,Taught me how to skagit cast and I caught a ton of shad on my switch rod because of it. Water was high for a lot of the season and it allowed me to throw heavy tips like a cannon!,1428883200,,179,3.5
8416779,5,B0045KJQQU,"Great production, well presented and worth every penny.",1427587200,,55,6.0
8416780,5,B0045KJQQU,Excellent DVD. Very well done with detail explanations,1422057600,,54,5.875
8416781,5,B0045KJQQU,"This is by far the best casting instructional video I have ever seen - and I have them all. I think this one (in it's narrow Skagit niche) exceeds Simon Gawesworth's Rio Spey Casting CD and Speypages CD effort. All three were great, but this one is exceptional. I will unequivocally call this one a 'must have'.",1338940800,10,311,4.473684210526316
