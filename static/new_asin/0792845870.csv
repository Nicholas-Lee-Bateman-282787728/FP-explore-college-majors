156682,4,0792845870,This movie is pretty cool but Vivien makes it marvelous! Hey DVD people! Why does this movie get released on DVD for the UK and not the USA? I would like this movie for my DVD collection!,1070755200,10,187,4.081081081081081
156683,4,0792845870,"Yes, those that complain that this 1946 film version of Shaw's famous play of the same name is mainly 'stage-bound' and the acting often seems 'stilted'-- well, sigh, they surely have a point.
Bernard Shaw himself (he did not die until the 1950s) is credited with the screenplay, which may have something to do with the criticisms. Shaw is very talky and hard to 'transfer' to motion picture standards of verisimulitude, but this movie has a beautiful, delightful Vivien Leigh, the incomparable Claude Rains, the beautifully dashing Stewart Granger, plus 'old friends' of the classic British cinema such as Flora Robson, Felix Aylmer, Basil Sidney, Stanley Holloway, Leo Genn, Francis L. Sullivan -- all who appeared in wonderful films like Laurence Olivier's 'Hamlet', David Lean's 'Great Expectations' and many other intelligent pictures of that pre- and post-war (WWII, that is) period. (There is even a very very young, but very lovely as always, Jean Simmons as a slave of Cleopatra who plays the harp.)
The picture attempts an 'epic' look, with battles yet noted I'm afraid by unconvincing stunt work and 'casts of thousands' sort of milling about -- and Cecil B. De Mille does this so much better than Gabriel Pascal, the director of 'Caesar and Cleopatra'. But I myself admit I love the Shavian ambience -- the intellectual activist actually attractive (in Shaw's plays at least!) to the winsome young woman; ... friendship, discussion and respect; thought as more important than 'action-adventure'.
If Shaw's plays do seem too dated to you and they generally bore you, yes, stay far away from this film! But if you brighten when 'entertainment' is also provocative to the intellect and not only to the eye (and other sense organs) -- and particularly if you have great affection for the era of British cinema dominated by Olivier, David Lean, and the early Tony Richardson and featuring so many familiar and adept character actors that fill the firmament with 'supporting' stars, you will like the movie, and ignoring its quite obvious flaws, enjoy every minute: I guarantee it!...",1054512000,20,2090,5.078488372093023
156684,4,0792845870,"This is a fine rendition of the delightful Shaw play.  A little rough around the edges when it comes to the supporting cast, but very enjoyable.  Shaw's Caesar is a man of self-doubt and good humor, a vivid counterpoint to the haughty, aristocratic Caesar of Shakespeare.",983059200,4,271,4.869565217391305
156685,5,0792845870,"I own this on Beta and just saw the last half again on Satellite.  I was greatly disappointed to find it is not available on DVD.  Perhaps the poor reviews you have for it have not helped.  This is a great play and movie.  All the stars give great performances.  Claude Rains is Ceasar as I want him to be -and believe he was.  I love the bits of wisdom that GBS sprinkles throughout the script, e.g.,""There's a Roman who knows how to make men love him!"" Vivien Leigh is a believable princess of Egypt. Rufio, the ideal Right-Hand Man. Pftatateeta, the perfect chief handmaiden for Cleo. Apollodorus and the British Slave both perfect in their roles.  This is one of the small number of films I can see over and over and still enjoy, even though, or perhaps because, every line of dialog is familiar.",975024000,51,800,4.438356164383562
156686,4,0792845870,"In 1945, Gabriel Pascal produced and directed the filmversion of George Bernard Shaw`s CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA, his witty and wordy play. The casting of VIVIEN LEIGH was a successful one, although critics dissected both her and the film with the writer`s approval(Shaw to Pascal: ""She`s all wrong. Must I drill her in diction?"") Vivien suffered a miscarriage after falling beating the slave and suffered from her first attacks of manic depressions. Tubercoloses was shortly afterwards also diagnosed. However; the production was Britain`s most expensive failure, as Taylor`s CLEOPATRA in 63 - the Worlds greatest financial failure for 20th Century-Fox. VIVIEN LEIGH is at her best playing a kittenish girl who must transform into a reigning queen. Naturally, Leigh does it with great style. Look for Vivien`s look-alike Jean Simmons playing the harp in Vivien`s confrontation scene with her women slaves. No wonder Olivier chose Simmons for his Ophelia i Hamlet 1948. Roger Moore is holding a spear somewhere and Kay Kendall one of the slaves. See my MORE ABOUT ME page about my thoughts of VIVIEN LEIGH",960940800,4,1100,5.220338983050848

I really like Claude Rains and Vivian Leigh, this no exception - a great tale told with great actor and actress and supporting cast - I actually prefer this one as Cleo not so bitchy but full of guile and sensual potency without losing my attention and not as tiring as that other version.  OK so I'm not a professional reviewer or someone trying to write a professional sounding review.  I don't agree with them most of the time anyway.  What I like about a movie may not be the same as others but I really think this one a great addition and as I say I prefer, maybe because it isn't trying to pass it self off as somehow replicating whatever was back then, it is entertaining and there are many great lines delivered by folks at top of their game.",1455580800,2,848,4.314465408805032

156695,5,0792845870,"I have no problem giving this product a five star review because it is as advertised.  I must admit I would much rather have a fully restored wide screen version of this Bernard Shaw classic!  This movie  is so well done I think it serves as a great prequel to Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar""( Marlon Brando, James Mason) & "" Antony & Cleopatra"" ( Charlton Heston, Hildegarde Neil) In which the scene of Apollodorus smuggling Cleopatra to Caesar in a carpet is mentioned.  This play/movie certainly has a Shakespearian feel to it & while it may not be a 100% historically accurate telling of the meeting of Caesar & Cleopatra it would be how I would love to believe it was!!!  Claude Rains portrayal of Caesar as a conqueror & leader so wise that emotions like vengeance are so beneath him as to be a luxury is incredible!!!  And the beautiful young Vivien Leigh at once embodies the naivety of youth, youths passionate ambition & the cruelty of a spoiled noble brat so cleverly that even at her most vicious you find her endearing.  The whole cast shines brilliantly from beginning to end.  Flora Robson who played Queen Elisabeth opposite Errol Flynn in "" The Seahawk"" with such subtle chemistry with Flynn & yet retained a convincingly strong & commanding presence as the queen plays another strong woman not as a queen but as a slave, nurse maid & fierce body guard to Cleopatra.  Flora Robson can pull off having a strong commanding presence whether queen or slave!  And Stewart Granger plays a merchant with so much charm & charisma he is welcomed with open arms by the royal elite.  The costumes, sets & armor are all so beautifully detailed I see something new every time I watch this movie. The cinematography is awesome but not so noticeable in this panned & scanned format, but its the only version of this movie I could find & will have to suffice until I can find a upgraded version because for me this is a must have movie!  after so many great reviews its hard to say something fresh & new about this great movie other than it is as deserving of all its laurel's as Caesar himself!!!  I could go on & on about the great performances delivered by every character in this film truly a great 123 minutes of motion picture entertainment!!!",1447372800,3,2248,4.576059850374065

156703,3,0792845870,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have watched this film several times and finally appreciated the witty dialog. Shaw sets a precedent for more modern phrases and lights up the B&W screen with audacity and welcome intrigue.

Beautiful vixen Vivien resorts many times to her impish Scarlett character and found this most annoying but loved the interplay with Claude. He made Caesar playful, powerful, and poignant. How could they have murdered him? History is told much more affectionately in this version and it is a treat. Many are offended by the inaccuracies, but if you know the difference the offense is lessened.

I think the horrendous burning of the Alexandria Library allowed by Caesar was the most difficult to comprehend given his appreciation of learning, literature, and history. This just did not make sense and wondered how Shaw got this all wrong, unless there is some factual aspect I am unaware.

Robson was unforgettable as the Chief Medical slave and remembered her in ""Withering Heights"" and ""Fire Over England"", such versatility! Stewart Granger provided much needed eye candy and over the top dramatics. His costumes were much briefer than other soldiers but guess if you have great legs, shorten the skirt!

Recommend for Claude and Vivien fans, Shaw's clever dialog and high jumps into the ocean.",1425772800,,1331,5.087155963302752

156706,5,0792845870,"This is a great, classic movie. Gabriel Pascal was one of Shaw's chosen directors and Shaw wrote the screenplay. It has the authentic feel of a great dramatist's work.  The Production design bears the signs of extensive research and the scale is magnificent. Auric's music is one of the great scores in film history. And, the cinematography is superb. But the real highlight here is the acting. Claude Raines brings a humanity to Caesar missing in almost all other representations. His work is one of the great performances. In this, he is matched, if not slightly exceeded , by the great Vivian Leigh. Her Cleopatra goes from hysterical girl to narrow-eyed plotter in one of the great transformations onscreen. There have been some fine Cleopatra's in film history, but only a  single great, transformative  one: Leigh. If you watch this film for only one reason, let it be to see her performance. Of course, she is backed up by a company of greats: Flora Robson, Stuart Granger, Ernst Thesiger, and so on. This is acting from the golden age. See this film.",1420416000,,1058,4.802197802197802

156721,3,0792845870,Interesting but very dated.  I watched this to see Vivien Leigh in a pre Gone withthe Wind role.  Her characterization was very much the same-Cleo and Scarlett.

156724,2,0792845870,A great well-acted film cursed to be on a poor not to well-done Korean knockoff DVD version. Images were fuzzy at times and there was some periodic momentary freezing experienced by my Blu-ray player. Audio is so-so. There is also some type of video artifact at the top left of the screen display (a dotted line about half the width of the screen) which displayed on my television. It seems that this film might not have been framed correctly when transferred to the DVD format. While annoying and a distraction the film is still viewable. It is unfortunate that this film has not received the restoration and first class treatment it so richly deserves. My rating reflects the DVD media and not the film. The film itself deserves a four star rating.,1407024000,4,750,4.6893939393939394
156725,5,0792845870,Caesar and Cleopatra is a classic!  Vivien Leigh's costumes and make-up are out of this world. It's obvious that the producers went way over their budget.

156726,2,0792845870,Not the best adaptation I've seen. Actors seemed mismatched to the plot and it dragged along so that I gave it up before it was over.

156727,5,0792845870,"This is my favorite Cleopatra movie.!!! A great cast, the best interpretation of Cleo and a great performance Claude Rains as Caesar.
While like most Hollywood (or British) movies on this genera liberties are taken with historical facts, the story, the cast and the overall
entertaining value is just outstanding.  I am kind of an unpaid expert on ancient civilizations, especially Rome, Greece and Egypt.  I
have hundreds of books  on  the subjects, modern history and also the ancient writers such as Livius and Herodotus(!) and I eat this
stuff up.  This film is sometimes called a comedy, but it has is serious, dark sides as well.  The portrait of Cleo by Vivian Leigh is
brilliant in my view, because Cleo was only 19 when Caesar first met her.  Liz Taylor, while playing the conniving queen well, did not
come off as a young girl of 19.  Leigh did, very childish at times, but also very brutish at times when Caesar was not watching.
Claude Rains come off marvelously both as the vain Consul, and yet compassionate and politically astute genius.  His death
goes down in history as one of the great murders of all time. along with Lincolns assassination.  What might these men have
done for their respective republics being torn apart by civil wars.  We shall never know.
  Did you know that Cleo actually married twice, both hubbies were her brothers and she managed to have  them both killed.  None
of the Cleo movies show more than one bother.  In Egypt, pharaohs had to marry some blood family female (mother, sister or
brother in case she is a queen) in order to inherit the pharaohnic powers to rule. Actually Cleo could not be a Pharaoh but could
be Queen thus Miss Big or THE BOSS.  Who can argue with that.  NOTE; Pharaoh (Per-a) means Great House.  And the best
thing about this great cast: No Dr Sweets!!!  Hope you enjoy this; I got mine from Amazon.  Get the extended Version.",1402790400,,1895,4.647590361445783

Though I did enjoy seeing the two actors together, I was slightly disappointed in the movie itself. Im not sure if its because I got use to Elizabeth Taylor in the role of Cleopatra or the huge budget that the 20th Century Fox put into ""Cleopatra"" but I just found Vivien Leigh playing Scarlet O'Hara all over again. Claude rains was superb but are we really to believe that Caesar was that mousy? These were Roman Soldiers and Barbarians use to taking what they wanted, period.

What will become of this relationship?

This is an intriguing 1954 movie with all the biggie actors of the time. However it looks like they threw in anyone that could sound English. I spent as much time identifying the different actors as I did watching the play.

I did not want a cheap Asian import of doubtful quality so, even though I live outside of Europe, I bought this PAL Region 2 version.

Considering the movie was made in 1949, I thought the color and audio was excellent- although there are some scenes that seem slightly over-exposed.

For those who grumble about it being PAL and Region 2, software is available on the market whereby you can convert it to NTSC format. Or, using the (free) program VLC, you can just watch it on your computer.

I am very pleased with this purchase- Great actors practicing their craft and they could not be better. Five stars all the way.",1345420800,,812,4.416107382550336
156747,2,0792845870,"""Caesar and Cleopatra"" is based on a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1898. Shaw (1856-1950) was one of the greatest playwrights of all time, and the only person to ever win a Nobel Prize (1925) for Literature and an Oscar (1938). His plays include ""Candida"" (1894), ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1897), ""Man and Superman"" (1903), ""Don Juan in Hell"" (1903), ""Androcles and the Lion"" (1912), ""Pygmalion"" (1912), and ""Saint Joan"" (1923).

The play's U.S. premiere was in 1925 and starred Lionel Atwill and Helen Hayes. This 1945 film was the first adaptation of his play for film, and Shaw helped adapt it for the screen. Bear in mind, this is a filmed version of a play, rather than a film about Caesar and Cleopatra.

Vivien Leigh (1913-67) stars as Cleopatra. She is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with husband Laurence Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as Dubois on stage in London followed by months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").

Cleopatra has been the subject of many films, the most famous being the 1963 production starring Elizabeth Taylor. Other actors who played Cleopatra include Theda Bara (1917), Claudette Colbert (1934), Pauline Letts (1951), Rhonda Fleming (1953), Virginia Mayo (1957), Lynn Redgrave (1983), and Leonor Varela (1999).

At the time of the film, Leigh was 32 years old, playing a teenage Cleopatra. In and of itself this isn't a problem, as many other actresses played the youthful Cleopatra when they were relatively long in the tooth (e.g., Elizabeth Taylor and Theda Bara were 31, Claudette Colbert was 34, and Virginia Mayo was 37). But all these other screen portrayals played Cleopatra as an adult, only Leigh tries to play her as a bouncy teenager.

Claude Rains (1889-1967) co-stars as Caesar. Best remembered for his roles as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) and Captain Renault opposite Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942), Rains had a brilliant career including supporting roles as Prince John in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), the evil Senator in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), Job Skeffinton in ""Mr. Skeffington"" (1941) and the politically astute Mr. Dryden in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). Along the way he received 4 nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Bette Davis considered him the best actor she ever worked with.

Caesar has been portrayed by Louis Calhern (1953), John Gavin (1960), Rex Harrison (1963), John Gielgud (1970), Timothy Dalton (1999), Klaus Maria Brandauer (2001) and Colm Feore (2005).

Caesar was in his mid 50s when he met Cleopatra. Rains was the perfect age, as were most actors who played Caesar - Rex Harrison was 55, Brandauer was 57, and Calhern was 58. Only Gielguld at 66 was a bit old to be played Caesar.

Flora Robson (1902-1984) appears as Cleopatra's nurse. She appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945).  Robson and Rains often worked together in films like ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940) and ""Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and she was paired with Leigh in ""Fire Over England"" (1937). Robson is funny in her over-the-top portrayal here.

Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954) directed and produced. Pascal was known for his adaptations of Shaw's plays, including ""Pygmalion"" (1938) and ""Androlocles and the Lion"" (1952). It's Pascal who wanted to make Pygmalion into a musical, but Shaw objected, and it was only after Shaw's death that ""My Fair Lady"" (1956) appeared.

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said the film was ""an elegant spectacle"" with a ""remarkably entertaining cast."" He said the ""sets have a rich and regal splendor, his costumes have great exotic charm and his people who wear and populate them play the Shavian whim to the hilt.""

1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".

One of the problems with this film is that it is a filmed play, and not really a film. It would be better entitled ""George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra"" so that people understand they are going to watch a filmed version of a play, and not really a movie. Personally I don't find this a problem, as there is considerable worth in seeing a play on film. But some film goers may find this objectionable.
Another problem with this film in Leigh's attempt to be a bouncy teenager. As good an actress as she was, and she was a really good one, at 32 even she cannot convincingly be bouncy.

Fans of Leigh will delight in  her portrayal, and for a woman in her 30s, she does do a great imitation of a bouncy teenager. And of course, Claude Rains is always good to watch. But be warned, this is a filmed play, and a play that is well out of date by today's standards, so unless you're prepared to accept this, you may be disappointed.",1308700800,6,5453,4.854682454251884

156770,2,0792845870,"The quality of the DVD is extremely poor, viewer be ware this is a cheap Korean product that will get stuck more than once, distort images and make the viewing itself an effort if not an outright ordeal.

I have never seen the Shaw play, but this movie does not encourage a viewing. It is neither comical nor interesting as Shaw's Cleopatra is a silly Victorian girl, almost ready to ask for tea and scones, and always accompanied by a guardian that has the silliest, most ridiculous name imaginable. The Egyptian queen as here played by the beautiful Vivien Leigh, does looks gorgeous in the costumes but is unsuited for the role and this is not one of her most memorable efforts. We know from history that Cleopatra was extremely well educated, spoke seven languages and had a very well developed mind of her own by the time they met, so this characterization is a total failure in representing the historical character of the Queen, here represented in the mistaken understanding of it by Shaw. It does however follow the malevolent tradition, started by the Roman historians themselves of maligning the queen and her court by portraying a falsified image of the sophisticated Ptolemaic Alexandria. Here we see the Egyptian court as mainly a collection of ridiculous women running around Cleopatra as if it were an Arabian harem in the style of Hollywood, where Maureen O'Hara could find herself at home.

It is particularly more difficult, yet nevertheless very telling of his character and age, to understand why Shaw saw the Egyptian queen as just a spoilt child, a fact that is more striking because at home, in England he had to have seen the accomplishments of the young Queen Victoria, who inherited the throne at the same age of eighteen as the Egyptian queen, and she started out her reign in 1837, almost twenty years before Shaw was born, so by the time he wrote his play he was more than familiar with this section of British contemporary (for him) history, but perhaps it was his racial and cultural prejudice that would not permit him to think of the two in the same level, or a natural aversion to credit women with anything of merit. Perhaps the fact that England had made Egypt a protectorate around the time his play was staged woudl make it politically correct to deride them as an inferior people. In any case, the idea that this eighteen year old queen, which considering the faster development of maturity in the Ancient world, was probably closer to twenty five in mental development, at least, would believe for a moment that the Romans could eat her as if they were cannibals is absolutely idiotic. Did Shaw forget that Cleopatra's father had plenty of dealings with the Romans, whom she must have seen close enough to know them in detail, from childhood?? It is even assumed by some historians that she accompanied her father to Rome in 57 b.c. when he went there to secure his throne and bribe Julius Ceasar and Pompey. Her entire political career proved that her assesment of their character and intentions was always accurate and on the mark, even when they had triumphed over her, for wasn't her suicide the perfectly calculated sabotage of Augustus triumph, as well as just as perfect, last grand gesture that utterly humilated that most burgeois of all Roman Emperors.

Claude Rains does a good job at portraying the Julius Caesar that we know from British tradition: brilliant, aloof, witty yet totally ungraceful, unsensual and un-Italian. It is extremely detrimental to the originals, that we know must about the Romans in America through British perceptions of the late 19th Century historians that invariably incorporated middle-class, bourgeois ethics, not to mention racial and class perceptions that were totally absent from the society they were depicting. As pertaining to his private life, Julius Caesar was well known for being bi-sexual in ancient Rome, where he was commonly known as ""the husband of all women and the wife of all husbands"" yet from the performance by Rains we would be more inclined to believe he was a retiring school master from his conversation, and particularly his demeanor, when in the company of Cleopatra.

Stewart Granger plays Apollodorus, an enterprising Sicilian that takes Cleopatra in a rug to Caesar. His is a character from fiction, as we know nothing of that boatman that carried the real Cleopatra to see Ceasar into the Royal Palace in Alexandria, not the lighthouse, as portrayed in the movie. Yet he does it well and is the only man capable of relaying in his demeanor some of the sensuality that is so completely absent from either Caesar or Cleopatra. Her maid and ""Mistress of the house"", played by Flora Robson is a wonderfully scheming character even though her name, Ftatateeta could only be the invention of a barbarian scribe, but the intention to demean, cheapen and malign the nature of ancient Egypt is definitely the reason it appears as such, though it may be argued that humor was the only reason. It should however been the name used for the title of the play, and movie, as it would be easier from that perspective to understand its intrinsically ridiculous character and intention, as well as the total break with the historical characters or even the older, better known, and far better work by Shakespeare.

Both Shaw and the director of this movie decided to ignore the fact that by the time Caesar left Egypt, Cleopatra had given birth to a son of his, the only male child he ever sired and acknowledged, which is something that couldn't possibly have occurred, and publicly have been acknowledged by Caesar, had he not been engaging in regular sexual encounters with the queen for some time. This makes the complete absence of sexual tension or desire between Rains and Leigh incomprehensible, and not one bit comical. Their affair was real, not the ridiculous pantomime Shaw presented in the theater and this movie reproduces, and it simply follows the ancient tradition of natural attraction between young intelligent girls for older successful men who happen to also have regular erections, which has endured to our own times, and is hard to believe could have escaped Mr. Shaw's observations.

I do not recommend the movie, as entertainment because it is extremely annoying, but it does have some interesting sets and costumes, if this happens to be a particular area of interest for the viewer. The real value of the film is accidental, as a documentation of the continued misrepresentation of Ancient cultures which has been and continues to be a major problem of contemporary education and particularly film representation in America that is long overdue reassessment and correction. It perpetuates prejudices, ethnic and cultural while portraying as history a largely fictional, biased creation. Although the film is an insightful commentary on the narrow and limited Victorian vision of the subject, it is nevertheless a malicious effort to distort historical veracity, to hide and distort the ethnic and cultural diversity of ancient Alexandria, which was once the very center of intellectual discourse of the civilized world, and the keeper of its cultural accomplishments in the famed library. Its tolerance of alternative sexuality and its unique mixture of Egyptian and Greek cultures could not possibly be more removed from the suburban, provincial society that is depicted in the movie, and as such it should be viewed and understood. This may well have been Shaw's understanding and intention for his prejudiced play, but I find that these movies should now have a disclaimer attached to the credits so that contemporary audiences, already more removed from classical history than their parents or grandparents, should be aware that they are viewing the interpretation and creation of one white male individual, largely expounding outdated and discredited ideas of colonial Imperialism and racial/cultural superiority which are no longer acceptable in the international stage. Specifically it should be clarified that this is his vision and not the consensus of civilized and educated opinion. It should be stressed that this is an entirely fictional story loosely inspired on Ancient events, and intended for comedy, hard as that may be to appreciate from our contemporary viewpoint.",1281830400,7,8310,5.009406657018813

The story relates the relationship between C&C in a perhaps not historically accurate version, but one which is more delightful than the real truth (for Cleopatra did have a child by Julius Caesar in reality) My only complaint is that the color is a bit garish, but this is due mostly to the state of the art at that time -- or perhaps it has been colorized -- I don't know.

156811,5,0792845870,"It's our amazing good fortune to have this document of one of George Bernard Shaw's greatest plays, filmed during his lifetime so that he could author the screenplay as he wrote the original stage work.  It is a monument to the magnificence, not only of Shaw, but of Caesar.  It is also a monument to Shaw's brilliant playcraft, clever plotting, and canny application of humor.  It goes without saying that Shaw was brilliant, since of course he was a socialist.

We have seen this story before, though differently told, when the wonderful Rex Harrison played Caesar to the talented Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra.  (Both of these names should be written with a K, since that is how they were both actually pronounced.)  It is an absolute truth about that later film that only the first half is much worth watching, since Richard Burton in the second half plays a lovesick puppy so well it's thoroughly disgusting.  GBS avoids that pitfall by giving us a great Caesar and a delightful Cleopatra, and fabulous stars to play them.

Shaw's play tells the story of Caesar's occupation of Alexandria after his final defeat of Pompey, and his defense of his position against perfidious Egyptians and renegade Romans in the service of Ptolemy XIV, Cleopatra's prepubescent brother and husband.  The text is a creation of the utmost cunning: nothing less than a successful imitation of Shakespeare (though mostly in a more modern idiom).  Few writers other than Shaw would have attempted this feat, and fewer still would have been successful at it.

Mentioning Ptolemy XIV, I should mention his (and Cleo's) brother, Ptolemy XIII.  They were both married to Cleopatra and each of them was pounding on her bedroom door by the time he was 10.  The film, alas, forgets the last Ptolemy, the XVth, called Caesarion, Caesar's son by Cleopatra.  It was his official acknowledgement of this son that caused him so much trouble back home.

The essence of Shaw is of course his wit.  Hardly a play of his is as witty as this one.  The film is 2 hours long and seems scarcely an hour, so packed is it with sparkling dialogue.

To portray this great literary work, the producers have assembled a gallery of some of the greatest actors of the time.  Caesar is played by the hugely talented Claude Rains whose portrayals of iconic roles have made him one of the greatest actors of the last century.  He gives the immortal Julius such sangfroid and cool calculation as to make us instantly believe his greatness as a general and statesman.

Cleopatra is portrayed by the great Vivien Leigh, who graced and enhanced every part she took.  Her beauty is in fact far, far greater than the legendary queen's (we have pictures).  There is a rumor that Cleopatra was African (black) by descent - which, while not a big deal, is a lie.  We know each and every one of her ancestors since before the time of Alexander the Great, and they are all Greek (and mostly closely related).  Shaw also cleverly switches the story of the rug from her first meeting with Caesar to ruse to smuggle her into Caesar's emergency redoubt at the Pharos (the Alexandria lighthouse).

Apollodoros (misspelt with a ""u"" before the ""s""), the Greek jack of all trades, arts, and talents, is played with huge humor by the inimitable Stewart Granger.  Granger's acting talents gave both of the Fairbanks a run for their money.  Cleopatra's nurse and chief bottle washer, Ftatateeta, is portrayed by the wonderful Flora Robson.  For this part her skin is stained dusky and she's given an Egyptian-style fright wig ... and is absolutely convincing.  When she's on camera, she manages to upstage even the riveting Rains.

The roll of talented veteran actors continues.  As Pothinos (misspelt with a ""us""), Ptolemy's puppet master and master of all nasty diplomatic maneuvers, we have Francis L. Sullivan.  It was Pothinos' idea to knock off Pompey in the hope of sucking up to Caesar.  No such luck, of course, because Caesar greatly admired and liked Pompey despite the fact that they had recently become enemies.  Sullivan portrays Pothinos with delightful wiliness and sliminess.  ***  As the loyal Rufio, ""Caesar's shield"", we have a steadfast Basil Sydney.  Rufio eventually becomes Roman ""governor"" of Egypt, although that country was then still technically independent and didn't have a governor.  Rufio's part is given a good shot of good-humored testosterone and Sydney gives it great stature.  ***  The talented veteran Cecil Parker gives us Caesar's faithful British amanuensis, Britannus.  His physical stature and Druidic appearance make him very convincing as a 1st-Century BCE British warrior-poet.  ***  And so on.  Every part in this film is well-played by people who know what they're doing.

The DVD itself was manufactured in Korea.  Don't expect a lot.  This Technicolor film has a washed-out look ... although the colors are usually clear if not vividly bright.  The sound is good (but could be better) and as we might expect from actors of stage quality, the dialogue is clear.  There are, in addition, English subtitles.  There are no extra features, but with older films we seldom get them.  Some people might take points off for substandard color and sound.  So do I.  I give extra stars for Shaw's genius and take them off for an inferior recording of the original film.  That leaves the correct total:  the maximum.

It's sad that shallow people with no appreciation of theater or great playwriting should inflict low-star ratings on this immortal film.  It's an insult to the greatest English playwright since Shakespeare.",1206144000,37,5589,4.922912205567452
