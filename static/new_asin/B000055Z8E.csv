The animation / CG still holds up surprisingly well, mostly because the backgrounds they used were taken from real life locations. The plot is decent and everything in this movie is of high quality.

I'd recommend checking it out if you're curious, it still holds up after 18 years, and that's not common among these kind of animated films.",1518825600,,561,4.333333333333333

The movie itself isn't one of Disney's best,but it works for a two year old obsessed with dinosaurs. I was actually surprised it held my son's attention being that has favorite dinos are actually the meat eaters, and this film focuses mainly on the herd/plant eaters. It was beautiful visually for it's time and it translates well to blueray. The quality is exceptional and still passes for good graphics for today. It's a bit more of a slow moving story, but for $10 and a total dino lover whose mom is obsessed with Disney this is a sure hit.",1511222400,,766,4.4714285714285715

Andrews Blu-ray Review: DINOSAUR [2000] is a terrific Disney style CGI computer generated animation, that brings prehistoric giants to life in Disney's mammoth adventure and was a respectable US box office success, and this computer animated adventure film has unfortunately not managed to eclipse the performance of other Disney recent greatest hits, nor surpass the hugely entertaining PIXAR produced computer animated films in terms of style and quality. At the time, DINOSAUR was the costliest animated feature ever, but from the first frame to the final roar it was clearly worth every penny.

The DINOSAUR film is set 65 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period, and opens with a dinosaur egg that is about to hatch, and an Iguanodon mother forced to abandon her nest, with only one egg surviving a carnivorous Carnotaur [Frank Welker] attack, but a rampaging Tyrannosaurus Rex destroys all but one egg. The egg is taken by an Oviraptor, who drops it into a river while fighting another Oviraptor, and finally is taken by a Pteranodon to an island inhabited by lemurs and because the Pteranodon is attack in the air, has to drop the egg and of course lands into a forest, and a group of hesitant lemurs who sees the egg land, and eventually Aladar hatches who is now sadly an orphaned dinosaur and is raised by the family of lemurs, and they name the baby dinosaur Aladar [voiced by D.B. Sweeny], and raise him as their own. But what I liked about the scene leading up to when the dinosaur egg drops into the forest, is that what we get to see is the vast vistas of the prehistoric landscape, which is totally spectacular and the Disney people sure did a brilliant job of evoking of what it might have looked like 65 million years ago on planet Earth. Also on top of that, from the time the egg is picked up by the flying Pteranodon and eventually it is attack in the air and has to drop the egg and when it lands in the forest, well that whole scene last exactly 7 minutes and 30 seconds and you get to view a totally fantastic spectacular flying sequence and is like fantastic rollercoaster filmic ride and you really feel you are flying, and it is such a shame it was not filmed in 3D.

When Aladar [D.B. Sweeny] is an adult, we eventually witness a massive meteor shower upon the island and the lemurs home is totally destroyed, Aladar and his family must leave their homeland. With only Aladar, his grandfather Yar [Ossie Davis], his mother Plio [Alfre Woodard], his best friend Zini [Max Casella], and his sister Suri [Hayden Panettiere] surviving the destruction of the island by swimming to the mainland and eventually they end up following a heard of similarly displaced dinosaurs heading to the nesting grounds where its believed that water and protection awaits them. The journey is long, and predators are constantly hoping to attack stragglers. As Aladar struggles to keep his family safe, he butts heads with arrogant and belligerent Kron [voiced by Samuel E. Wright], the head of the herd who takes survival of the fittest to heart.

While the animated film maintains a strong moral centre, and they say that it never attempts to replicate the savage reality of such a real life situation; well to me that is totally utter rubbish, as to me it has a really strong morale stance on all aspect lifes ups and downs, especially how Aladar really grows up the long journey to the promised land. Disney's remarkable achievement is in catching up so much technical ground in four short years, establishing a computer animation studio and producing such a visually splendid animated film. To some people say the problem really lies in the story scenario, which some may find to be slightly non-Disney in style, but despite this I really enjoyed the whole experience of the Disney CGI animated film DINOSAUR. Also what has really made me angry, again all the reviews I have read of this Blu-ray disc, is that everyone moans about how bad all the creatures look non-realistic and do not look as good as what the BBC produced of their dinosaurs, well I think all the creatures, especially the dinosaurs look totally fantastic and realistic and I felt I was there experiencing all what happens to the creatures, but what a shame it was not in 3D, the I think it would of looked even more spectacular, but despite this, it was a really enjoyable romp through prehistoric Earth.

DINOSAUR was Disneys first attempt at entering the CGI computer generated imagery and cost a supersaurus-size $130 million failure  to some critics, but the unofficial numbers put it closer to $200 million, and the most expensive CGI animated film ever made by Disney, but to me I feel Disney really delivered the goods 100%. Fearing comparisons to other animated films of the same genre that was out at the time, the budget for this became as gigantic as the dinosaurs depicted, but the saving grace was the background art which was the best part of this CGI animated film, and a massive total visual treat of great proportion, and especially for the younger generation audience. But most importantly, DINOSAUR is for Disney aficionados and hearkens back to the animated films of the 1970s  1980s. The real mystery is why this dinosaur film has taken Disney so long to realise their dino-mite potential, still as the say better late than never. But I hope grown-ups will goggle at the eye-boggling and mind blowing special effects, while young children will alternately cheer and cower behind the couch in the lounge with some of the more scary and dramatic scenes in the film, but remember children it is not real.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you this Blu-ray disc in an exceptional high quality 1080p encoded image presentation and is also helped with the 1.85:1 aspect ratio. I have read some very negative reviews about the image quality, but I am happy to report that I found myself very impressed with the cleanliness of this image transfer presentation. You also get moments featuring large solid image areas, where I expected to see extensive colour noise, but I could not detect any throughout the animated film. This Blu-ray really has a very firm and stable picture quality, and again I did see loads of very negative reviewers berating the image quality, talk about over the top nick picking, where I saw just 100% pure quality image resolution. Also I have also seen several reviews saying that during the film, for example a late-night cave scene about midway through where they had trouble making out what was going on, well to me this is total rubbish, as I could see everything that was going on and now and again you got blue lightning flashes going off that bathed the inside of the cave really well, so as far as I am concerned they must have a cheap rubbish Blu-ray player. What was also good to see were the black levels that are excellant. What also impressed me were the views of the prehistoric landscapes, especially with all the totally realistic actual landscapes and so very cleverly incorporated into the CGI computer animated characters. But I especially liked film's organic, earthy visual aesthetic of the animated film and to me it is an all in all good effort on the part of the Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings you this Blu-ray disc with two main audio choices, which are 5.1 LPCM Uncompressed Surround Sound and 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and I found there was not much difference, but both gave a perfectly fine sound mix experience to be sure. The sound design mix is a far more front-heavy for this big-budget animated film spectacular like this one, unfortunately even the depth and impact of the sound quality itself felt slightly muted. There was a slightly downgraded aspect with the dynamic range, such as distorted high end sounds or clipped low bass sounds for some unknown reason, and again unfortunately the surround sound use is also very restrained. Time after time throughout the animated film, especially such as the dinosaur attacks, or the night-time rainstorm of comets, the rear speaker channels hardly produced hardly any activity, and certainly nothing in this sound mix comes close to producing the ""wall of sound"" effect I was hoping to hear, but the sound experience that was at its best was when you got the very dramatic composed film score by James Newton Howard with certain  scenes in the film, this is when all your speakers really get a good workout, but maybe Disney felt they did not want to spend a lot of money on the surround sound experience, because of the box office failure, still I would rather have this Blu-ray disc, than the previous inferior DVD release I had in my collection, but all in all the CGI computer animated film makes up for the slightly downgraded sound experience, oh well you cannot win them all.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: BLU-SCAPE: ORIGINS [2000] [1080p] [1.78:1] [6:12] Here we get to view a short high definition film that has been produced exclusively for this Blu-ray disc by award-winning filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg and his stunning breath-taking time-lapse photography and you also get view is a National Geographic type like travelogue of the film's fictional locales, and looks absolutely stunning in 1080p video resolution. It also has specially composed music by Michael Whalen. This has no connection to the Disney animated film DINOSAUR.

Special Feature: Movie Showcase [2000] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:00] With this special feature it allows Disney studio to give us three clips from the animated film DINOSAUR to show off the most dramatic scenes in ""the ultimate in high-definition picture and sound experience,"" and gives us the viewer three scenes that represent the best in Blu-ray audio and visuals of the animated film DINOSAUR that has to offer.

Special Feature: The Monster Cloud [2000] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:10] With this special feature, the Filmmaker's explain in great detail how they created The Monster Cloud and go behind-the-scene to view the big explosion effects, where they go into great technical detail about one of the film's awesome visual highlights, especially with the help of creating the digital effects, they used every trick in the book, like miniatures and little pyro techniques, so as to give the effects life like experience as if you were there when it happens. Contributors include: Baker Bloodworth [Co-Producer], Neil Krepela [Visual Effects Supervisor Artist], Neil Eskuri [Digital Effects Supervisor], Jim Hulin [Effects Compositing Supervisor], Terry Moews [Visual Effects Supervisor], Pam Marsden [Producer], Gerard DiNardi [Production  Manager for Live Action Unit], Evan Jacobs [Vison Crew Unlimited], Steven Douglas Smith [Director of Photography 1st Unit] and Thomas Schumacher [Former President of Walt Disney Feature Animation].

SNEAK PEEKS [1080p] [1.78:1 / 2.35:1] [1:12] Haunted Mansion; Sky High; Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pear; Eight below; Chicken Little and BLU-SCAPE.

Finally, DINOSAUR [2000] finds Disney, who worked very hard to make sure that the faces of the dinosaurs were totally expressive. But what makes the story get into your heart is seeing the characters learn and grow and overcome massive challenges. The technological mastery of DINOSAUR is totally dazzling to watch, though, especially the textures, especially of the fur, scales, eggshell, water, and goo are all so vivid you can almost touch them, shame it was not in 3D. To some critics felt the animated film had some shortcomings, but its visuals are nothing short of total incredible spectacular images. Parents with young children who frighten easily should carefully consider whether they are ready for this animated picture, but I know for a fact that children will love the computer generated animation and especially I know that their firm favourite characters will be Aladar and his lemur friends. For me personally, I really enjoyed the whole experience of this Disney CGI computer generated animated film. Highly Recommended!

Now my 4 yr old is going through a Dino phase and I remembered how much my oldest used to love this movie. So I rented it on amazon for my 4yr old. And he love love loved it!!! For a movie that came out16 yrs ago, the animation is incredible. It's a very intense movie though and probably not a good idea for a child any younger than 4. Even 4 may be a bit young.

2098737,5,B000055Z8E,"This is a brave, new groundbreaking milestone for Disney: a completely CGI-programmed story all about the very last dinosaurs struggling to survive AFTER the fateful night of asteriods hitting the Earth, thus bringing about the very mass extinction of all the species. Uh, is it COMPLETELY CGI-programmed? The sweeping ariel shots of the prehistoric world where a hungry pterodactyl carried a dinosaur egg high over the craggy cliffs, the frothing waterfalls, the raging sea, and all are so life-like I wonder if they are ACTUALLY shot as a live-action footage rather than animated. If not...then...well, the Disney animators are just one step from playing gods!
The story itself is hardly original because it is very apparently written in the recognizable vein of Land Before Time, Tarzan, and yes, even Elfquest. But it is at least told with many very new twists that are quite breath-taking nevertheless. And I just love how all the dinosaur and lemur characters are anthropomorphized, especially the grumpy poppa of the hero's love interest! His whole face moves just like that of a ear-boxing army sergeant, which I found terribly amusing! If there are some parents out there who are griping about how the very idea of dinosaurs actually talking ruined the movie, take it easy. This is a FANTASY done from a very realistic perception. What's more, how else can we learn the story if all the dinosaurs remained silent? And if you want a serious scientific study of dinosaurs, just take the kids to a nearby science museum.
Once again, this is a great experiment that Disney is trying out to give their animation a new face. So it will be a bit while for some viewers to get used to it. Like, for instance, there's very little humor in this movie. But - actually, as long as the story holds your attention fast, comedy isn't always necessary. Sheesh, do you REALLY miss all those Broadway-style songs, wisecracking sidekicks, and slapstick gags??? Oh, well...there's always a whole variety of animated movies, both present and past (and surely, in the future) to choose from. But it's about time for the animation to go even further and thus explore many different ways to tell a story, folks. Otherwise, this is quite a visually stunning odyssey into the unknown!",1475193600,,2267,4.93717277486911

I am probably not the best reviewer on this one because I am solely giving it 5 stars being my son is just obsessed.,1455235200,,364,3.6794871794871793

2098832,5,B000055Z8E,"5 stars if your kid loves dinosaurs.  My 3 y/o was a little scared but only for a few scenes where the meteors were hitting at the beginning.  I thought he Carnotaurus was very scary too, but for some reason that was not as scary for him -- All the good dinosaurs can speak and the carnivorous ones don't and behave more like wild animals acting on instincts.  4 deaths total (as I remember):  One where the Carnotaur eats an unknown dinosaur -- no blood or guts or anything and it is viewed from a distance.  The other one is a sacrificial death that might be hard for a little one.  The third is the dinosaur's own fault, was at the warning of others, and the other dinosaurs made attempts to save him but to no avail.  The 4th is the Carnotaur himself, and everyone in my house was cheering for that one.  All in all, it is a story of a family trying to survive and who sticks together and helps others along the way in a search for a new home.  Hope you enjoy!",1454544000,,964,4.139784946236559

2098995,3,B000055Z8E,"This semi-animated feature starts out like a fabulous wildlife adventure, only prehistoric.  And then it crashes to an abrupt halt when the lemurs start yakking like cartoon characters.  You can blame that lousy decision on Michael Eisner.  He forced the filmmakers to use dopey dialog befitting a kiddy flick not unlike that other dinosaur cartoon series (The Land Before Time).  Complete with a suspiciously similar plot (an arduous trek/death march to find the nesting ground).  Following Einer's dubious guidance, they ""intentionally veered away from scientific fact"" because they weren't trying to create a documentary (more's the pity).  Instead, they created realistic looking dinosaurs that grin and talk.  One even has a British accent for pity sake!!! (Joan Plowright as the sole surviving Brachiosaurus).  Hearing today's jargon coming from a dinosaur is decidedly odd.  Why go through all that effort to make them look real only to treat them like Barney.  With idiotic dialog like, ""who booked this trip anyway?""  That......would be Michael Eisner.

Such great potential wasted on a bad joke.",1420416000,,1105,5.39766081871345

The cinematography is breathtaking, and the animation, mixed with live-action backgrounds, is spot-on.  If you're looking for a Jurassic-type movie to watch before the sequel opens this summer, then this is not the movie for you.

2099059,2,B000055Z8E,"After reading all the reviews maybe my expectations for this movie were just too high. I was really disappointed. I found the characters to be not very engaging and there was a lot more dino violence than I was expecting. The violence is only fair, we are talking about dinosaurs, but I didn't really like my 4 year old watching it. He was fine with it (in case other parents of 4 years olds are reading this.) but I don't need my kid to see that. My fault for picking a dinosaur movie. Anyway, I find that as an adult I typically like Disney movies. I just had a hard time sitting through this entire one. There were one or two parent jokes that weren't subtle at all. I usually appreciate the subtler ones better, just feels better crafted. Maybe I just didn't like this because the characters weren't cute. I don't know. I'm just glad I rented it instead of buying it.",1402185600,,871,4.3496932515337425

2099062,3,B000055Z8E,"I consider myself a Disney fan, but even I have to admit that not all of their output has been exactly stellar.  And during the 2000s they put out a string of stinkers that tarnished the reputation they had managed to regain in the '90s.  While some of these films have since been vindicated by history and are now seen as underrated classics, such as ""Treasure Planet"" and ""Lilo and Stitch,"" others, like ""Home on the Range"" and the endless parade of direct-to-video sequels, are usually ignored even by hardcore Disney fans.  And in a few cases Disney decided their best bet would be to copy another company's intellectual property, such as their blatant ""Madagascar"" ripoff ""The Wild.""  As one might imagine, this rarely works.

""Dinosaur"" is an example of the above -- one of Disney's weaker efforts, at least in the story department, and a rather blatant retread of the 1988 Don Bluth classic ""The Land Before Time.""  And while a gorgeous film visually, it's a mostly forgettable film.

""Dinosaur"" follows Aladar, an Iguanodon who is raised by lemurs after his egg, through a series of contrived coincidences, ends up far from its nest and on their island.  When a devastating meteor shower destroys their island and much of the dinosaurs' lands, Aladar and the surviving members of his lemur family -- patriarch Yar, adoptive mother Plio and her biological daughter Suri, and his wacky friend Zini -- swim to the mainland and try to find a new place to live.  They end up joining a mixed herd of many kinds of dinosaurs, led by the brutal Iguanodon Kron whose mantra is ""survival of the fittest.""  Aladar struggles to find his place among the herd, and ends up befriending some of the herd's outcasts -- sassy Eema, doglike Url, and quiet but regal Baylene.  As heat, dehydration, dangerous predators, and Kron's own pride and brutality begin to take their toll on the herd, Aladar finds himself becoming a reluctant leader, and struggling to save his friends and family.

I'll get one thing out of the way -- the visuals for this film are stunning.  The CGI looks terrific for its day and holds up relatively well today, and the movie manages to almost seamlessly blend its CGI environments with its live-action backgrounds.  The dinosaurs look properly saurian, and are able to emote without looking overly human.  For the film's other weaknesses, it is a great technical achievement and looks gorgeous.

It's the story and characters that don't hold up, in my opinion.  The story is essentially ""The Land Before Time"" with a more grown-up cast of characters, rehashing the plotline of a ruined prehistoric world and a brave band of mixed species trying to find a near-mythical paradise to call home -- in this case just substitute ""Nesting Grounds"" for ""Great Valley.""  It even rehashes ""Land Before Time's"" leadership battle between Littlefoot and Cera, pitting Aladar and Kron against each other at every opportunity.  The only difference is that both Littlefoot and Cera had to learn and grow along the way, letting go of their pride and learning to work together, while in ""Dinosaur"" Aladar is constantly proven right and Kron is consistently wrong, and too stubborn to change his ways.  About the only way it strives to be different is by throwing in the Disney-esque romantic subplot -- and really, does a dinosaur movie need a romantic subplot?

Which leads me to my second complaint -- the characters.  For being such a lushly animated 3D film, this movie has extremely bland and 2D characters.  Aladar is a boring protagonist, his love interest has no personality whatsoever, Kron is a one-note antagonist, and the lemurs, Ziri especially, are the standard annoying sidekicks that add nothing to the movie.  The secondary villains, the T-Rex-ish Carnotaurs, don't even speak, which is a shame -- the movie could have been made so much more interesting had the predatory dinosaurs had as much personality and character as the herbivores.  The only character who shows any development is Bruton, Kron's lieutenant, and that's handled in a rather ham-fisted way.

Yes, ""Dinosaur"" was financially successful, but it's still a very weak entry in Disney's animated canon.  It's still very pretty to watch, but if you're looking for a story with more meat to it and characters you can actually care about, opt for the original ""The Land Before Time"" instead.",1400112000,,4369,4.908843537414966

2099068,3,B000055Z8E,"If your kids absolutely love dinosaurs, you should buy this.  The story is well-written but a bit slow.  The voice acting is great.  Most important, the characters and settings are rendered beautifully!  They really brought prehistoric creatures to life here.  The visuals will keep you watching when the story is just kind of dragging at parts.

The dinosaurs are not as cartoonish as the Ice Age movies, for example.  Much more realistic, in my opinion.  What it lacks is the excitement and comedic relief that the Ice Age films have plenty of.  These characters are not as memorable or adorable.

It's a good movie, but will appeal only to those who really like dinosaurs.",1399161600,,675,4.842105263157895

2099075,3,B000055Z8E,"I bought this for my nephew who is fascinated with all things dinosaur and knows more dinosaur names than I ever did and also corrects my pronunciation on dinosaur names. He absolutely loves the movie until the monkeys/lemurs/primate part comes in. The opening scene with the dinosaur montage is really nice and he likes to watch that over and over. But when the ""story"" starts, he's less interested. And, to be honest, the story seems kind of dopey in the way that only Disney can dope up a story -- the tragic loss of a dear elder, the challenge to overcome, the love interest that starts with friction and a misunderstanding, the lessons about friendship overcoming vast differences -- blech! I'm kind of with the 4 year old on this one -- more dinosaurs in every scene!!",1397088000,,774,4.656934306569343

2099078,5,B000055Z8E,"This movie was shear pleasure to watch. The movie looks visually absolutely stunning and the animation is done nicely. It's true eye-candy and entertaining as well.

The movie has a typical adventurous story and feeling and is at times spectacular as well. Especially the beginning is impressively spectacular. There are some nicely done action sequences that are at times tense as well. My only true complaint of the movie are the characters. There isn't really any character development in the movie and we never really get to know the character or care much about them, this is probably mainly due to the short running time of the movie. Also of course the story itself is somewhat predictable but that doesn't take away any of the fun or entertainment value of the movie.

Dinosaur fans will enjoy this movie as well, unless you're one of those persons who complains about the accuracy of the movie. This movie is entertainment, not a documentary.

The musical score by James Newton Howard fits the movie like a glove and in my opinion he delivers one of his best and moving scores, in his career.

There is much hate for this movie but quite frankly I can't see why. If you simply take the movie for what it is, you'll have a good time watching it. It's beautiful, adventurous and at times truly spectacular!

2099081,4,B000055Z8E,"Disney Studios 39th full length animated feature film Dinosaur could be one of their most ambitious to date. One of three Films released by Disney in 2000( Fantasia 2000, and Emperor's New Groove were the other two). With seamless CGI, real locations and detailed miniatures this film achieves a breathtaking look that doesn't look dated 15 years later. The meteor shower is a standout in the fast paced thriller, which may be a little too intense for young kids, but for kids who love Dinosaurs this is a must see film.

The Blu Ray looks great, but I am not a fan of the set up. There is no menu and it goes straight to the movie and if you want to access what little special features that are on here the option pops up on screen. I can't believe how cheap this Blu Ray was put together and for such a great film that deserves a lot better treatment. Why all of the features on the impressive 2 disc DVD weren't carried over is a mystery, but par for the course for Disney so it seems.

2099115,3,B000055Z8E,"Okay, tonight's review is about the majestic dinosaurs.  Our main character is an orphaned little misfit, all alone in the world, with only his family to keep him company.  One day, disaster strikes the planet, and this heroic dinosaur must lead a misfit herd to a beautiful paradise lush and green, and protected on all sides from dangerous predators.  In the meantime, our hero must clash with a stubborn, foolish brute leading the heard in the wrong direction, starvation, and some dangerous and persistent predators.  And thus, is our movie of choice today...and it's not The Land Before Time.

Dinosaur

Okay, got the whole ''Dinosaur is a knockoff of Land Before Time'' bit out of the way with a bit of humor, now on to the background behind this film.  Originally, this was not a Disney cannon film; it was made by a separate subsidiary company of Disney's that was to begin production on some heavily realistic-looking computer animated films, and Dinosaur was supposed to be the benchmark film.  Back in the day, there had never been a CG film that looked so impressive and so realistic.  Back in 2000, animators had been trying to push the medium of realistic-looking CGI animated films all while trying to reach out into far more adult cinematic flare (remember, this was before Shrek came along and brushed off the ''seriousness'' of PG-rated animateds), with many other examples including Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Polar Express, and Beowulf among many others.  Dinosaur was the first of these films to make a profit, while most of them became box office bombs; however, the result with all of these films eventually lead to the foreclosure of the respective studios that made them--includng Dinosaur's studio, The Secret Lab, even though the studio only made one film and it turned a profit.  The reason for this?  Disney continued to either cancel or deny the Secret Lab any material to work on, and as a result, the studio's only other credit before foreclosure was as the effects company for Reign of Fire.  Because of this, Dinosaur--in spite of it's box office success and moderate critical reception--was literally the studio's only feature film made entirely by them, and when they went down, Disney claimed the film and made it a part of the cannon.

With that out of the way and getting back to the whole ''Dinosaur is a ripoff of Land Before Time,'' I for one consider such a statement a compliment to Land Before Time, which is a series I hold nothing but contempt for.  Dinosaur is indeed strikingly similar, only nowhere near as sticky and far more mature in general.  And frankly, given the choice to go with or without voice overs (and thus be compared to either Fantasia or Land Before Time), the filmmakers had to pick their poison.  But the quality lift starts with the animation, which looks far and away better than just about any film with a heavy emphasis on CGI released today--animated or not.  In a way, the film can be compared to The Dark Crystal on a technical aspect; all the characters are animated--or in this case, CG--but the landscapes themselves are all live action.  That's real muddy water the dinosaurs are drinking, as are the trees, sun, everything (within the realms of reality, of course; the asteroids at the beginning are obviously computer animated).  Cut the comic relief, and we'd get something closer to serious filmmaking--or better yet, the voice overs entirely as should have been the first option.  The opening sequence is incredible eye-candy.

The story and the characters, however, is where everything falls flat.  And by that, I mean none of the characters really leave an impression on me at all.  Aladar is a generic protagonist--by any narrative medium standards, not Disney; Kron is an obvious villain.  And obviously wrong; the lemurs are boring (and I must ask; were there ever really lemurs during the time of the dinosaurs?  I'm actually curious as to the accuracy of their placement); Neera's an obvious love interest; I don't even remember the other characters (you'd think a character who is essentially the last remaining brachiosaurus would make for a compelling or interesting character, even if she is a wise elder of the herd); there really isn't anything there in the character department.  Not terrible, but they don't even leave an impact.

And while I do credit the story for not dripping with disgusting sentimentality--and is if nothing else a more adult take on Land Before Time--the story is still, essentially, The Land Before Time.  Even with the differences made with the ending, the third act echoes the originally planned act of The Land Before Time before post production edited the order of sequence in which the last twenty minutes of that film were to occur (it's a very long story, but needless to say, Littlefoot laid his eyes on the Great Valley before returning to his friends' rescue).  I don't think that was intentional on their part, but it still stands; the basic blueprint of a plot is practically identical to that of Land Before Time.  The only difference is its control of sentiment; it's far more sincere here, and would be more touching if the characters had any depth.

The music does have some grand tunes to it; not a single song to be found anywhere in this film, not even the end credits.  But it doesn't really escalate the film beyond what it truly is; looks impressive, but completely bland and generic all around.  Not the worst crime ever committed by a Disney film, but that isn't saying much.  If you like this sort of film, fine; but unless you absolutely need to see some of the best CGI eyecandy you may very well ever see in your life, you should just as easily live a happy life never having to gaze at a single frame of it.  Rodger the Ocelot concurs.  He purred during the opening scene and stuck a little while longer, leaving the room once Aladar and his lemur family bumps into his soon-to-be herd.",1383523200,,5990,4.7974683544303796

THis can happen at any time of the day or night.  I sincerely wish I had purchased from a dedicated video site such as VUDU but amazon makes it easy to rent and buy streaming videos as it does its other merchandise so I thought Id give it try. My husband is a computer engineer so our 60"" smart tv is also hooked up to a PC so we get Netflix easy enough online or we can press a button on the remote and get it even easier and never has Netflix had any of these amazon freezingup issues. Nothing has ever frozen up on our tv.  So this will be our first and last movie we add to our amazon video library and thats too bad. Being old customers with a instant account, it was very easy to simply press a button and purchase this movie. My little boy loves anything dinosuar and he LOVES this movie. We give it 5 stars but as for Amazon video, we give you 1 star. We are seriously thinking of eating the 10$ it cost us on amazon and buying the same Dinosuar movie from a dedicated video site. I can only hope our desperate act will allow us to finally watch DINOSUAR uninterruped, which is how its suppose to be.",1363392000,,1572,4.015974440894569

Well as time passed by the tape got recorded over and I lost my dinosaur movie. I happened upon it in walmart not too long ago, but it costed around $12 dollars. I checked on here and all new versions of this movie were also $12 dollars (or more). I bought it used for $3 dollars (thankfully) and while it was a good movie, it was not worth $12 dollars. This is a good kid movie, as well as a family movie, and it teaches good lessons in it as well (work as a team, help others when you can, there is always hope, etc.).

I sat back on my recliner and was glued to the screen from that point on. The movie is so heart wrenching and too intimate to describe. I don't necessarily recommend this movie to young children because it contains a few adult themes dealing with death, Darwinian principles, the apocalypse or dinosaur holocaust, severe malnutrition, neglect and moments of procreation.

2099213,4,B000055Z8E,"They look real, they really do! I would have sworn they were working from photographs except that I don't think Disney really has a time machine. And of course, when he gets to the babies, they are too cute to be real. But the big ones, and the landscapes all look amazingly real.

The story is one disaster after another. First, an iguanadon egg is carried away by a variety of egg-eaters and other fateful accidents where it lands on an island inhabited largely by lemurs. When the egg hatches, inside is the cutest little baby dinosaur you have ever seen in your life. (C'mon, admit it: how many baby dinosaurs have you seen?) The female lemur is enchanted, but the alpha male points out that creatures like that eat creatures like them for snacks. But it turns out he can't destroy the cute ""little"" thing either, so they decide to raise him as an herbivore. They name him Aladar.

Apparently it worked, because the next scene he's grown up considerably, and the lemurs play all over him and he has a great time. But one day a huge meteor shower starts to fall, frightening them all, and eventually one humungous meteor lands, breaking up the landscape something awful and separating those few lemurs who were playing with Aladar from the island which is now in flames. Soon, they come across a huge migration of dinosaurs of all types, with the predators to the back, picking off the slow ones. The social dynamics are quite human-like in many ways, of course, and Aladar takes up with the slow ones at the back of the herd, helping them along and defending them. The leader is a tough old Darwinian, but his sister is a pretty lady of the same species as Aladar.

From here you can write the story yourself, since you've seen lots of Disney movies. It's a pleasurable movie, the graphics are quite amazing, and the story has enough complexity to keep it going. I'm sure it would be better with kids around, but I liked it. I'll give it three stars.",1336953600,,1954,4.529745042492918

2099218,5,B000055Z8E,"With a simple but very effectively told and well-constructed story, terrific CGI animation, and voice talent that makes the characters come to life, Dinosaur (2000), is a visually impressive, and emotionally moving adventure, set long, long ago, when giant reptiles walked the Earth.  The film features a variety of different kinds of dinosaurs, as well as lemurs, with the creatures having the ability to speak.  If you liked the Jurassic
Park films for the dinosaurs, you will love this movie.

A dinosaur egg winds up on an island inhabited by a large group of lemurs.  When the egg hatches, a family of lemurs adopts the baby iguanodon, and names him Aladar (D.B. Sweeney).  The reptile grows to maturity, and is accepted by the lemurs as one their own.  When part of the planet is hit by a meteor shower, life on the island is threatened.  Aladar manages to save some of his lemur family, as they end up in the ocean, and swim to safety on the nearby mainland.

Riding on Aladar's back is his `mother' Pilo (Alfre Woodard), `sister` Suri (Hayden Panettiere),  `grandfather' Yar (Ossie Davis), and his best friend Zini (Max Casella).  With the rest of the lemur clan apparently gone, there is sadness, but little time to cry, as the meteor shower has affected the climate, and the survivors are still in great danger.  To escape a group of hungry carnivorous velociraptors, they join a heard of dinosaurs led by an aggressive Iguanodon named Kron (Samuel E. Wright), who are headed for a place called the `nesting grounds'.

Aladar and his family quickly become attached to a trio of older slower moving dinosaurs.  Baylene (Joan Plowright) is a brachiosaurus, Eema (Della Reese) a styracosaurus, and Url an ankylosaurus.  With predators trailing behind, Kron is determined to keep the herd moving along, and is willing to sacrifice those who can't keep up.  This cold hearted attitude causes several confrontations between Aladar's group and Kron who's only concern besides himself, is his sister Neera (Julianna Margulies), who has taken a fancy to Aladar.

Applying human values to animals, the movie examines two different approaches to the crisis.  Kron's way is survival of the fittest, where the strongest rule and decide the fate of others.  Aladar's group shows compassion for those less physically capable, putting their lives at risk in the process, as the elderly dinosaurs fall behind, and are stalked by a pair of fierce carnotaurs.

Standing strong together, is a message that is emphasized repeatedly.  Being open minded, in different circumstances, Kron's way might be the more sensible option, but a true leader has to step up in a crisis, and not just be a bully full of hubris.  Kron simply doesn't measure up, getting more black marks, for sacrificing his wounded second in command Bruton (Peter Siragusa), and for running away instead of standing with his herd against the carnotaur.

As you might expect from a Disney production, the special effects are top notch, the music is very solid, and the vocal talent does an excellent job.  Sometimes having big stars doing the voice work can be a distraction, but that's not much of an issue here.  Performers like Julianna Margulies, Della Reese, Ossie Davis, and Alfre Woodard, are seasoned actors whose voices are familiar, but are perhaps not immediately recognizable.

While fairly predictable, this is still an entertaining adventure, with a meaningful message.  Baylene her group step up at a crucial time, and standing together, the herd does indeed reach the nesting grounds.  Essentially a tale of survival, the violence is well within the context of the story, but may be too intense some really young children, who often are captivated by dinosaurs, however most school aged kids should be able to handle the violence.",1311465600,,3802,5.003179650238474

2099226,3,B000055Z8E,"I have mixed feelings about this one. On one hand the visual execution of Dinosaur is superb and is a work of art all its own. On the other hand even for a PG movie the story and writing often times fall to the extremely predictable Disney formula of animated feature films. Dinosaur does give a lot of unexpected pleasure all things considered.

First off the computer animation is excellent. The mix of live action backgrounds with the CGI are practically flawless and very well done. As far as the animation is concerned I was very impressed. It goes a few steps beyond what I saw in the Toy Story series. The first ten minutes of the movie are completely breathtaking, and it happens to have absolutely no dialog. If only the script followed suit.

The story flows just like every other Disney animated film. As if the scripts of your standard Disney animated feature film were not disappointing enough they go and make great pains to say this is a unique and more adult oriented movie yet stick with the same tired and overused Disney formula. And if that's not bad enough they go with the same premise as Don Bluth's The Land Before Time. Why is it you can't make an animated dinosaur movie that takes a LONG time before the cataclysmic meteor hits the earth. Dinosaurs were around for millions of years yet everyone is fixated with making movies with that moment in mind alone. I mean come on guys! Think outside the box for once.

This release seems to be essentially a repackaging of the single disk Blu-Ray and possibly the single disk DVD. I know the Blu-Ray will have the exact same features as the one released back in 2006. I cannot yet confirm if the DVD is also going to just be the single disk released a while back. Either way if you are into special features it appears the original Two Disk Collector's Edition DVD is still the way to go. If you already have the Blu-Ray then you're really not getting anything special here. This is only for those who missed out on the standard edition disks previously and want the flexibility of having both disks.

In spite of the utterly predictable plot Dinosaur is still a real treat for the eyes. I am still debating whether or not I would have preferred the movie if it had no dialog. That would have at least reduced some of the pains I felt enduring a plotline I must have seen dozens of times over the past 20 years.

2099228,4,B000055Z8E,"In a gorgeously done computer-animated movie, an infant iguanodon begins life with a very near escape before he's even hatched: when his siblings are crushed in the shell, his egg survives a series of perilous situations until it's dropped on an isolated island.  There a troop of lemurs adopts the baby over the objections of patriarch Yar (Ossie Davis), who warns that ""Things like him eat things like us!""  But the young dino, named Aladar (D. B. Sweeney), turns out to be a gentle herbivore who becomes a beloved member of the family even though he's much too big to share in its tree-climbing adventures.  In fact, his size serves them well when a meteor shower ravages their island and the four survivors of the troop--Yar, his daughter Plio (Alfre Woodard), Plio's youngster Suri (Hayden Panettiere), and the would-be great lover Zini (Max Casella)--manage to make it to the mainland on his back.  There they encounter a large herd of dinosaurs, mostly iguanodons, trekking to the ""Nesting Grounds"" through a landscape changed and ravaged by the meteors.  With compassion and cleverness that tyrannical herd leader Kron (Samuel E. Wright) can't match, Aladar saves the day for almost everyone involved--including triceratops Eema (Della Reese), ankylosaur Ernie, and brachiosaurus Baylene (Joan Plowright), ""the last of her kind""--as the herd encounters a dried-up lake, a landslide that blocks their way into the valley, and a pair of persistent carnotaurs.  The lesson here is that new ways are often better than old ones and that brute force isn't always the best means of approaching a problem.

2099231,3,B000055Z8E,"Back in the year 2000, Disney released a CGI-animated film simply entitled Dinosaur. Costing over a hundred million dollars to make, it combined real-life settings (Venezuela) with computer-animated characters (dinosaurs). There were no cavemen involved, only the reptiles. The trailers for this film led us to believe that this would be a groundbreaking achievement in computer animation. Well, the CGI looks great, but the film itself is a bit of a disappointment.

But first, we've got to talk about the look and feel of this film. I have to admit that the CGI dinosaurs look fabulous. Every single character is extraordinarily detailed. The meteor sequence looks disturbingly beautiful. The special effects really do look amazing. Add in some fine cinematography and a mesmerizingly haunting music score, and you've got a great-looking film. So what's so disappointing about Dinosaur? If you've seen The Land Before Time, then you'll see some similarities. Several elements of the plot have been borrowed from Don Bluth's 2D-animated film, such as the search for a piece of land that has been untouched by a cataclysmic disaster. We've seen this sort of story before in many other movies. Then, there's the moral lesson of not giving up and cooperating with each other to avoid a more personal catastrophe. There is very little originality in this plot. Even a line of dialogue from The Lion King (""Lions eat guys like us!"") has been borrowed. Next is the film's unsatisfactory screenplay. I don't think I have ever heard such preachy, and cutesy, dialogue before in a Disney film (whether animated or live-action). I know this is supposed to be a family film, but the characters all sound like they're either teachers or students. I mean, the themes this film focuses on are always analyzed, which ruins the overall movie experience. Lines such as ""it's your choice, not your fate"" can be easy evidence of this. And I also have to mention that the dialogue can also be juvenile at times? This isn't Sesame Street, and it shouldn't sound like it's from Sesame Street. Adults should be immersed in this, too. There are, unfortunately, other flaws: formulaic comedic sidekicks, clichd antagonists, and the sentimental happy ending make the film it worse.

Disney could have done a much better job with Dinosaur. It could have had a solid story, solid writing, complex characters, and a much better tone. What we've got instead is a case of style-over-substance. Now, I will admit that I admire the look and feel of the film. The CGI animation, the music, and the cinematography are the things that keep me from grading this movie lower than a C-. Unfortunately, everything else keep me from grading this higher than an A-. Dinosaur deserves a C, and it could have been so much better.

2099237,5,B000055Z8E,"Disney's movie, Dinosaur, combines real, exotic places with 300 million dollar animation in a seamless, truly beautiful film. It is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and mixed with a soaring musical score, Dinosaur is a delight to the eyes and ears.

The story centers around Alladar, whose stolen egg ends up on an island through a series of breathtaking, rapid events.  When he hatches, he is adopted by a family of lemurs (monkeys). The next time you meet him, he and his lemur ""brother"" have matured. That is when the island and much of the mainland are destroyed by a massive fireball from a fallen meteor. Only Alladar and his lemur family escape to the mainland where they find a devastated, hostile kind of world.

The story is a departure from normal Disney sing-song cartoons. The content is more serious and graphic, without gore. It is more earnest and realistic, but has some great humor. And the facial expressions of the characters are absolutely incredible. So lifelike! It is a journey of the heart.

The thing I appreciate most about the story is the compassion that Alladar and his family show to the mainland dinosaurs. They express the love and loyalty of family, while most of the mainlanders are fractured and wandering and care only for themselves. In the end, the vast and varied ""herd"" have a life and death choice between a leader who rules by strength and brutality, and a leader who has earned the right because he cares about them.

I recommend this film for all people 8 years old and up. Parents, little ones might be frightened by some of the more intense scenes, as there are deaths, so it would be wise to sit with them, or use discretion if they have tender sensibilities.

2099250,4,B000055Z8E,"Dinosaur is one hour and twenty-two minutes long and was released on May 19, 2000. The movie focuses around Aladar who was taken from his nest when a carnotaur enters the nesting area where he is being hatched. The egg finally winds up on an island of lemurs. Plio finds the egg during the point of hatching and decides to keep the baby. Aladar grows up to be an adult Iguanodon. One evening a meteor shower attacks the planet and Aladar and his family flee the island and wind up on land. The group attaches itself to a herd of other dinosaur looking for the nesting grounds were there is plenty of water and green grass. Kron is the self appointed leader of the group and believes in survival of the fittest. Two older and heavier dinosaurs befriend Aladar and the group; they are Eema and Baylene. Eema is a Styracosaurus and Baylene is a Brachiosaurus. Also with Eema and Baylene is Url who is an Ankylosaurus. The eight of them form a friendship and lookout for each other. Along the way to the nesting place Aladar falls in love with Neera, Kron's sister. As Kron force marches the dinosaurs along the hot desert sun, Aladar, Eema, Baylene, Url, Plio, Yar, Zini, and Suri fall behind. This is due to Eema and Baylene being slow and old. The group finds Bruton, Kron former right hand dinosaur, who was left behind when a carnotaur attacks. Bruton was injured in a fight when the group finds him and befriends Bruton. All of them take shelter in cave when two carnortaurs attack. Bruton is killed while trying to get the rest of the group to safety. Bruton was able to kill one of the two carnotaurs during the cave in while the other emerges from the rocks and leaves the cave. The survivors find the end of the cave and are able to smash open the wall. On the other side they find the nesting grounds. Eema points out the way they would have come in are now a straight drop. Aladar returns to tell the other dinosaurs about the danger that lies ahead and that he has found a safer way to the nesting grounds. Kron does not want any part of this and fears that his leadership is being threaten. Kron attacks Aladar and a fight erupts. Neera intervenes and the rest of the dinosaurs follow Aladar to the nesting grounds. As they are about to head to the nesting grounds a carnotaur attacks the group. The dinosaurs stand together and scare him back to a wall. The carnotaur sees an opening and attacks Kron. Kron and the carnotaur fight it out but Kron is killed in the fight. Neera and Aladar try to come to the rescue but it is too late. Aladar in the end defeats and kills the Aladar. The movie ends with the herd of dinosaurs at the nesting grounds and Neera and Aladar watch the hatching of their first baby dinosaur. The main problem with the film (a small one) is that all the dinosaurs' features in this film are not from all the same time period and the same region also. [...]. Overall it is a very good movie and about a caring dinosaur. Dinosaur gets a B+.

2099255,4,B000055Z8E,"First off, this movie is a Disney animated fantasy.  It isn't ""Walking with Dinosaurs,"" and was never meant to be, any more than Disney's ""Hercules"" was meant to be a serious examination of ancient Greek mythology.  Disney made a number of choices about this movie as a story, rather than an documentary.  They included lemurs to add a touch of the familiar, and because they are humanoid enough for people to be able to relate to them.  They didn't use one of the mammal-like critters that actually lived alongside the dinosaurs, because it's hard to relate to something that looks like a carnivorous rat.

There is some violence in the movie, and it definitely does deserve a PG rating.  The scene where the lemurs' island is wiped out in the meteor impact is fairly intense, and the main adversaries are a pair of carnotaurs, giant predators similar to the more famous T-rex.  Since they relate to the world mainly by biting things, you should probably preview this movie before letting small children watch it.  The main conflict in the movie is actually between the orphaned hero Aladar and the herd leader, Kron.  Kron firmly believes in that the strong will live, and that the weak should perish.  Aladar was raised by lemurs, and believes that everyone, even the old and ""weak"" have value, and that strength comes from working together.  Needless to say, they don't get along very well.  Kron also sees the younger Aladar as a potential threat to his authority as herd leader.

Overall, this is an enjoyable popcorn movie.  While it doesn't match the level of storytelling set by ""The Lion King"" or ""Beauty and the Beast,"" I don't think it ever really meant to.  And it is at least as watchable as the original ""Land Before Time.""  (The first one, not the endless wretched sequels.)  The computer animation is very well done, and the various creatures are believably merged with the real landscapes that were used as backgrounds.  And the movie is *at least* as historically accurate as any other Disney movie.  :)

Be warned that this particular movie is known to have hardware compatibility problems with some DVD players.  One of the other reviewers here included a list of machines that are confirmed to have issues with this disk.  I personally have ended up having to buy this movie twice, because the first disk I purchased was defective and wouldn't run on *any* machine, but that appears to have been a fluke manufacturing defect, like buying a toaster that doesn't have a power cord.",1216512000,,2501,4.7808857808857805

2099260,5,B000055Z8E,"One of the most brilliantly entertaining short family films ever put on video tape. It features a family of four who visits a dino-filled zoo called Dinosaur World. In the parallel universe in which this movie takes place, dinosaurs still exist, but they are confined to only this one zoo.

The movie opens in, ten year old, Tim's dinosaur themed bedroom (perhaps the same Tim from Jurassic park). Tim fills his backpack with everything he could need including food, water, flashlight and a compass. Tim's younger sister Mary belittles him, ""It's a park, it's not an African jungle or something"". Tim hastily exclaims, ""There aren't any animals in Africa with teeth the size of stake knifes! I'm ready for anything!""

This is a film that was written for the young ones. I was seven when I first saw it, and I got tons of enjoyment out of it (and still do). Sure the dinosaur animatronics don't exactly look real, but kids in the nineties didn't care and they probably still don't.

Upon entering the park an employee warns them, ""Stay on the marked paths and please don't feed the dinosaurs""; of course this is a grim joke; by ""don't feed the dinosaurs"" she clearly means ""don't get eaten"". The video is certainly more humorous than it is scary, because even the idea of being eaten by dinosaurs is handled quite lightly. ""Visitors eaten this year: 0"" says one big sign at the front of the park.

The family's first stop is at a hat stand, where the low-IQ mother is persuaded into buying a ridiculously large hat under the impression that a flying pteranodon might defecate on her head. ""There's enough room under my hat for all of us incase any pteranadon's dive-bomb us"", this is the first mention of pteranodon poo in the film, though certainly not the last. At that point we see the first dinosaurs on the tour, which Tim educates his family (and ours) about. In fact, Tim knows everything about dinosaurs, more than any ten year old should ever know. But like most ten year olds, Tim just wants to see the Tyrannosaurus-Rex.

Next stop, the restaurant; this is the highlight of the film. Every food item is named after a dinosaur: brontosaurus burgers, parasaurolophus punch and pachycephalosaurus soup are among the many items on the menu. ""I don't want to eat a dinosaur"" Mary says. ""Nobody's eating dinosaurs, they're rare and endangered, besides they're just too hard to catch"". Suddenly, and without warning the waiters and waitresses sing a song about all the dinosaur themed menu items. It's hilarious. In fact, I love it so much that I memorized the whole thing.

Then Tim and Mary wonder off to find the T-Rex, but they get lost. Hence the title, ""Lost in Dinosaur World"". When Tim's compass breaks, the kids have no way of getting back to mom and dad, and it's getting closer and closer to feeding time and their inevitable confrontation with the T-Rex. I give this video a five out of five. It looks fake, but you get what you pay for. Best penny (plus shipping) I ever spent.",1204416000,,2993,4.669829222011385

Standard good animation notwithstanding, I liked this film for two reasons: cause it's a dinosaur animated film and because it touched on all the things we want our childern to learn, but we ourselves forget: friendship, loyalty, being different, loneliness, heroism, sacrifice, fairness and its opposite.. this film is a wonderful illustration of the basics I want my child to learn / take from home and stand for when he grows up.

2099277,3,B000055Z8E,"I don't think Disney made an absolutely terrible film (keep in mind I haven't seen Home on the Range or Brother Bear) so we have Dinosaur which many people praise for the animation while it mainly gets a ""meh, it was okay"" response when it comes down to the actual film itself. Got to give credit to them for at least attending to do something different and not as common as they were starting to do. It's one of those kind of films where you admire the effort and the passion there was but it's just unfortunate other things got lost in the shuffle.

Aladar was a lucky dinosaur: through a series of strange misadventures while he's still an egg, he eventually lands on Lemur Island and befriends the community there. He later grows up and feels a bit alone since there's none of his kind around. One day, a massive meteorite hits the ocean causing the group to vacate the island and they end up stumbling upon a herd of many species searching for the ""Nesting Grounds"", a sort-of haven for dinosaurs. But then have stalking raptors, T-Rexes, the harsh weather as well as a dinosaur named Kron who is basically the harsh bully who pushes everyone forward and leaves those behind that are too slow.

Since it's obviously going to be the first thing you notice, I might as well start with it first. Using real backgrounds and putting over it CG-characters, this is one gorgeous film. Sometimes it doesn't work such as characters that feel more like Xbox 360 characters and the interaction between real backgrounds and the characters are too noticeable but when they're on it's great. While they're mainly branded the ""kid movie studios"", when Disney turns up the mature meter, they're unbelievably effective. The centerpiece is the meteor impact which is not only stunning and intense but I love how it's edited, especially the pre-impact part. Ranks with the wildebeest stampede and the avalanche from the Lion King and Mulan as the best action scenes in a Disney film.

How's the rest? Not that good. For one it feels too cliche. You have the main hero who has to save everybody, the anti-everything good bad guy, the love interest who is denied the chance (in this case, she's Kron's sister) and then we have the issue of talking dinos. While this is a photo-realistic looking film which warrants hyper-realism, meaning no talking, it is Disney after all and what kid would sit still to basically watch dinosaurs do stuff? Then we have the issue that the characters themselves are not that interesting. No one really stands out and is that memorable. The only one I even remember chuckling at was Earl, this puppy-acting dino who is quite amusing.

Ultimately, this is one of Disney's more interesting failures. While it did generate a profit and the animation is really great, it's one of those missed opportunities that's hard to shake off.",1173398400,,2844,4.727822580645161

2099282,2,B000055Z8E,"I was torn how to rate this movie.  My three year old loves it, so in his opinion I suppose it deserves 3 or 4 stars.  However, I am writing the review and I do not care for it, so rated it as such.

What do we not like about the movie?  First of all, the story line.  It's slow, boring, and monotonous.  The same thing happens over and over.  The protagonist, Aladar and his family, join a group of dinosaurs making a life saving journey to ""The Nesting Grounds"".  Along the way, the leader continually makes hard hearted decisions, Aladar tells him he doesn't think that's a good idea and Kron gets mad, threatens him, and/or fights with him.  Over and over.  Meanwhile the script is unamusing and forced with such lines as, ""You ordered a wake up call for the Dawn of Time.""  And Aladar is called a ""Jerkasaurus"" by the love interest.  Thereby creating the romantic angst.

The scene of the Lemur courtship is utterly corny, embarrassingly so!  Not to mention the ""talk"" the young males and females are each given before hand by the wise ones of the group.  For starters; the Patriarch to the young males, ""And if you mess up, don't worry they'll NEVER remember.""  Matriarch to the young females, ""This is a day you'll ALWAYS remember, so enjoy it.""  Come on, this is DISNEY?  What happened to the famous Disney script writers?  This script feels like it was written as a group project in a junior college writing class.

And, not to mention that it is a very violent film.  My three year old loved it, but he is too young to really understand the violence.  A child a few years older could really become frightened.

Now, what are the good points of this movie?  The computer animation is wonderful.  The dinosaurs are incredibly real.  The use of real footage combined with computerized images is breathtaking.  The opening sequence is mesmerizing and the musical score that accompanies it absolutely soars.

I feel as if the art came first and the story came second.  There are so many things they could have done with a dinosaur story, this one just simply missed the mark.  With a little more thought and attention I'm sure Disney could really have come out with a wonderful video.  Instead, I now realize why I had never heard of this movie before stumbling across a preview for it on another video.",1168646400,,2308,4.542579075425791

2099284,5,B000055Z8E,"""Dinosaur"" is a fantastic computer-animated film taking place at the twilight of the age of the great beasts, right when the asteroid that spells global catastrophe strikes.  This is the story of a diverse group of animals - various dinosaurs and small, furry proto-mammals, who end up banding together to seek a safe haven where the green still grows plentiful.  It's not the most realistic movie ever made (animals close enough to see the impact manage to survive and escape the chaos) and it's not meant to be.  It's a great All Ages adventure movie with humor, danger, action, and tenderness.  Many will probably hear about this movie - talking dinosaurs and little monkey-like critters team up to escape the killer asteroid - and think that it's a movie that everyone six or under will love, a pretty good amount of kids in the seven-to-twelve age bracket will love, but that few viewers older than that will find much enjoyment in other than watching the kids.  Although I may not be the best judge of such things (there's quite a few 'kids movies' that most people over twelve don't like but I've enjoyed), I think ""Dinosaur"" is different than that.  It's a true All Ages movie that a pair of forty year-olds can watch as easily as a pair of four year-olds.  I would liken it to ""E.T."" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" as a movie whose appeal can cut through age lines.  It's extremely well done, has universally engaging themes, and isn't as predictable as one might think.

  Very highly recommended - without question among the top three or four non-Asian computer-animated movies, and compares very well with Asia's best animation while it's at it.",1168387200,,1655,4.771929824561403

We watched  ''Dinosaur'' several times, each time enjoying it more than the last.

My four-year old son, however, has another opinion.  At this point in his development, realistic dinosaurs (even ones who speak) aren't his cup of tea.  He gets a little scared.  But given time, I am sure he will come around.

Just by listening closely to the superb sound and watching the stunning graphics, you will be able to tell that ''Dinosaur'' is more than just another dino-flick, but a labor of love.

2099302,4,B000055Z8E,"Following in the footsteps of such animated classics as ""Toy Story"", ""Dinosaur"" continues Walt Disney's tradition of exciting and fun computer-animated films.

Aladar (D.B. Sweeney) is a young Iguanodon who joins a group of lemurs on an island after surviving a T-Rex attack and being scooped up by a Pterodactyl.  However, a meteor shower destroys their island home, forcing Aladar and the lemurs back to land and other dinosaurs.  Soon, the group encounters a large herd of dinosaurs travelling towards the nesting grounds, which contain fertile land, along with plenty of food and water.

Aladar and the lemurs decide to join the herd, but they soon meet Kron, a fearsome dinosaur who is the so-called leader of the herd.  Many of the other dinosaurs complain that Kron pushes them too hard and they cannot keep up.  They are befriended by Baylene, a no-nonsense Brachiosaur and Eema, a feisty Styrachosaur, but Aladar becomes enamored with Neera, a female Iguanodon who happens to be Kron's sister.  Needless to say, there are some tense moments between Aladar, Neera, and Kron.  Neera is not interested in Aladar at first, but as their journey continues, she begins to like him more and more.

Kron fears that Aladar is trying to take his place as leader of the herd, so they have many confrontations along the way.  Also, large Carnators have been tracking the herd.  Will they reach the nesting grounds before the Carnators get them?  Will Neera realize how much Aladar cares for her?

This is a good movie for both children and adults.  My 5 and 3 year old children like this movie very much, and they ask to watch it frequently.  Although there are some ""scary"" parts, such as the meteor shower and the battles with the Carnators, overall, it is still appropriate for young children.  The animation in the movie is very good.  The dinosaurs look very life-like, and the scenery is extremely vivid.  The story is well-conceived, as well.  The length of the movie is just right to hold a child's attention for the entire film, too.  I recommend this movie for parents and children alike.

Now for the reason it got 2 stars. Disney has sunk to an all time low. Not only have they made a silly attempt to copy the success of Pixar films, but they went so far as to shamelessly rip off The Land Before Time. I mean, they didn't even try to make the story original. The opening scene copies the opening scene in the TLBT almost directly. What's worse is that I went into the theatre expecting this to be the best movie ever. I came out wanting to throw up from digust of this trash. I thought the whole movie was going to be like the promo trailer and nobody would talk. It would just be a visual art piece. But then I heard them talk and I was appalled. Another thing that drove me crazy was the fact that a lot of the characters just weren't lovable. I'm going to spoil something right now. 80% OF THAT MONKEY FAMILY DIES AND THE REMAINING DON'T CARE AT ALL!! Sure they cry for one second then they just go back to being comic relief.

Why does Disney insist that every animated film have two directors? Just wondering.
In any case, when I first saw the previews for this, I had hopes it was going to be a full-length animated silent film. So I ended up initially disappointed, but at least they got some fun voices.
Newbie director Leighton and second-timer Zondag (whose earlier film was the painfully bad dinosaur flick We're Back!) have, basically, done an update of The Land Before Time with stunning animation and (to say the least) a better voice-acting cast. Where The Land Before Time used unknowns (though Helen Shaver has since gone on to relative fame), Dinosaur started with the works: D. B. Sweeney (Strange Luck), Ossie Davis (Do the Right Thing, Bubba Ho-Tep), Alfre Woodard (Holiday Heart, A Wrinkle in Time), Max Casella (Doogie Howser MD), Julianna Margulies (ER), Della Reese (Touched by an Angel)... you get the idea.
The story is your typical cutesy Disney pablum (if you're expecting Winged Migration after watching the incredible trailers for this flick, steel yourself for political correctness now) overlaid upon the Land Before Time storyline; best if we leave it at that.

2099309,4,B000055Z8E,"""Dinosaur"" is a fine film from the folks at Disney.  Like ""Hercules,"" the story isn't moving or too impressive, but the film is fun to watch and has some brilliant moments in it.  Many people have bashed the film for being too violent, but the PG rating does seem fair.  I agree that kids under the age of five shouldn't see this movie without some serious adult supervision, but at the same time, children do need to know about death...even if it's violent.  The Carnotaur sequences involve quite a bit of violence, but these are dinosaurs!  Dinosaurs ate each other in reality.  Don't knock this movie for that reason.  Here's a concept:  Watch the movie with your kids(you won't be bored) and then explain to them that death and violence was a very real part of daily life for dinosaurs.  It may take your children a little time to cope with this information, but sometimes the truth hurts.  If your child is under the age of five, you may want to skip certain sequences in the movie because of the violence.  My daughter watched this movie, but I always managed to skip through the violent parts for one reason:  she's two years old.  She loves this movie.  When she gets old enough to understand that things die, I'll let her see the violent sequences in this film.
For adults, I found this movie very entertaining.  As in other reviews, I agree that the visuals are stunning.  The film is brilliantly animated and does use some real scenery to blend in with the CGI graphics.  The differences in the two are almost seamless.  The lemurs provide both comic relief and solid wisdom in this flick.
If for no other reason, buy this movie for it's artistic value, but the story is a good one and the characters are very believable.  It's a good show, but I cannot help but reiterate the importance of watching this show with young kids in order to explain some of the things that occur in it.",1076025600,,1893,4.514705882352941

2099311,2,B000055Z8E,"If you've got kids, take them to see this movie!  It's incredible -- sort of.  BUT, personally, I wouldn't take kids under 7.  It's kinda scary in places, and when the Carnosaurs eat the friendly dinosaurs -- or when the family of monkees gets killed -- the kids will ball their eyes out.  They don't need to see whole families wiped out and eaten at that age.  Call me conservative or something, but I just don't see how that helps kids.
The story is basically the same as THE LAND BEFORE TIME --dinosaurs looking for a safe haven.  Here we have the a meteor shower which supposedly is going to lead to their extinction -- but the meteors fall like rain.  It's nasty and all that... but hardly good science.  Plus, the dinos act just like people, and that is sort of a put off -- especially because of the way the film begins -- very nature based and keen on painting a realistic visual.
The graphics are at times incredible and at other times blurry and indistinct.  This animation was supposed to be the best ever -- I thought some of the shots were just that, and then most of it was bland and dark.  I've noticed that most of these computer animation shots are dark -- perhaps because if they were lit up enough the eye'd be able to spot all their flaws.  I dunno.  But it was annoying and the effect was like watching a drive-in movie at dusk, before it's completely dark -- the color and detail is sort of washed away.  I think that explains it well enough.
But the story did have a good message, and it was clear and strait-forward enough.  And at least it was a family movie that adults could sit through without getting stomach cramps and wanting to vomit in the aisle -- I think I'll pass on the new Pokemon movie coming out this summer, I don't care how much my nephew begs!
I give it 2 stars all along... perhaps a bit more from a kid's perspective.  But I'll say this much... my nephew (little JJ) was far more excited about the film BEFORE seeing it than he was afterwards (he even got us a couple dinosaur hand puppets and we sat in the theater attacking each other before the movie started! :).  And at one point in the film he even said, ""Uncle Johnny, this is a bad movie.""  He said that when the Carnosaur was eating the poor defenseless dinosaur.
Sure, that may well be the ""real world"" and all that... but too much for kids.",1054425600,,2346,4.295454545454546

And it is not rare to find violence or scary stuff in thier animated movies. This movie may be good for kids to watch if they are 8 and up, otherwise you will have to find either a rare Disney movie that contains no violence or scary scenes, or watch an animated movie that is not from Disney. As the movie opens, a couple of animals sees a baby dinosuar bron from an egg. The father of the group doesn't want the baby, but the mom and the kids do. The baby is named Aladar (D.B. Sweeney). But when a fire destorys the animals' home, the surving animals move on to find a new home. And join a herd that includes a dinosuar named Neera (Julianna Margulies) and her grumpy brother (Samuel E. Wright). It is very rare to find a Disney animated movie that is good for very young kids. In fact, I'm not sure if you would find a Disney animated movie good for very young kids. But at least the MPAA was smart enough to give this a PG rating instead of a G rating, like they usually give Disney's animated movies.

The dinosaurs look real when they talk they have a character all their own. The story plot is good. It's about Aladar, an Iguanodon. As an egg is stolen from his nest is taken to an island isolated from other dinosaurs and raised by a family of lemurs. His childhood buddy and sidekick is Yar. After a meteor fall to earth the vegetation begins to die off. In order for them to survive they must go on a migration along with a group of dinosaurs lead by the tough Kron to find a new home with water and food. It's a test of between strong-wills and survival of the fittest to making it to the dino promised land. Aladar meets a wise-cracking female Iguanodon, Zini. She takes a permanent liking to Aladar. Following up the rear is two old lady dinos, Baylene and Eema who add a spark of charm. And, what story would be with the bad guys. Bad, nasty Carnosaurs! They don't talk their attitudes let you know they mean business. They follow the group and make their journey-one to tread lightly. The good guys always win in the end. The bad guys meet their demise and the merry group find their new paradise. And the rest is a happy ending!

2099316,2,B000055Z8E,"When I watch a computer animated movie called Dinosaur, the only thing I expect out of it is 80 minutes worth of entertainment.  So why is this one of the more interminably dull Disney releases I've seen?  For the most part, the film plods at a snail's pace, with little but the first-rate dinosaur animation to keep things afloat.
The movie does get off to a breathtaking start, as it features an egg that goes through series of mishaps and adventures before it finally ends up in the hands of a monkey colony.  The egg turns out to be a dino (looks like an iguanadon, the ones with those pointy thumbs) who is cared for and raised by the monkeys.  He is named Aladar and this perfect life of his with the monkeys comes to a complete halt when an asteroid strikes the vicinity, destroying their home, forcing all the animals in the area to search for new land.  Through the journey, they must brave the dangers of the carnivorous raptors and carnotaurs to reach paradise.
In case you haven't noticed, the plot closely resembles The Land Before Time, so much so I wonder what Don Bluth would think if he ever saw this movie (or maybe he already has).  There's one crucial element that separates Dinosaur from The Land Before Time, and that's the fact that TLBT was at least kind of fun.  It gave us a genuine dilemma, a few slighty memorable characters, and a terrific score from James Horner.
My appreciation for Dinosaur, however, is entirely on a visual level.  The folks at Disney have done a marvelous job of crafting these ancient creatures and rendering them to life.  It's dynamic work, but as visually stunning as these creations are to look at, listening to them is another story.  The voicing is subpar, and even worse, the characters are completely lifeless.  Disney's animated offerings usually give us at least one or two memorable characters per film; this one features a grand total of zilch.  Only this movie and Tarzan can lay claim to that dubious statement.
Probably the worst decision from the filmmakers was to set the majority of the movie in a desert wasteland.  Here are all these great, expensive CGI visuals, and they end up getting dumped in a thoroughly drab, unimaginative setting that does little to spark or fuel the imagination.  There's no sense of wonder, no awe, no excitement, and most importantly, no fun.  For great escapist entertainment with dinosaurs, stick with Jurassic Park.",1043366400,,2419,4.712589073634204

Those who would engage in semantic tap-dancing -- ""family values"" does not equal valuing families -- and insist Disney Inc. is, somehow, ""entertainment"", fail to see the corporate mind-set.

2099326,4,B000055Z8E,"This film must be seen to do the amazing visuals justice. Sadly, the plot and dialogue are thin; however, this is one incredible piece of eye-candy. Said to be eight years in the making, obviously it was the scenery and dinosaurs that took up all the time, not the storyboards.
Beginning with the telling of how the main hero(Aladar) winds up on his lemur-infested island,the film really has its best punch in the meteor shower which hearalds his return to dinosaur life. This sequence is among the most amazing put to animation film, and is a guarenteed jaw-dropper.
Unfortunately, the story snags quite a bit after that, only working in fits and starts. The Carnotaurs are credibly fearsome, but seeing how all the other charactors in this film speak, it seems odd that the Carnotaurs don't. The whole point of the film after the meteor is to reach the lush, verdant nesting grounds, which are undeniably beautiful...
... Despite that, the CGI work in this film is truly amazing, you really can't tell where reality ends and computer takes over, with real-life backgrounds with computer-rendered dinosaurs and effects.

2099327,2,B000055Z8E,"I was really looking forward to Disney's animated epic Dinosaur. After all, it was reportedly eight years and million[s] in the making. I don't know exactly what I expected. Did I I think that the recent explosion in computer graphics technology would result in a corresponding breakthrough in movie storytelling? If so, I must have been naive, for what the powers that be at Disney decided to do was to take this dazzling technology and graft onto it a story that is merely a rehash of those used in some of their past hits. Dinosaur proves that playing it safe isn't always the best way to go.
The opening is spectacular. A herd of dinosaurs is grazing peacefully. We see a mother watching over a nest of eggs. Suddenly, a huge carnasour emerges from the woods looking for dinner. In the ensuing mayhem, only one egg survives. What follows is a spectacular series of events in which this egg is transported to an island faraway is populated by mammals rather than dinosaurs. A family of lemurs finds the egg, and it is here that the movie starts to disintegrate The lemurs begin to speak, and this is the first time that words are used in the movie. I did not expect Disney to make a movie so profoundly different that none of the characters talked, but I was startled to find that they had been lifted straight out of The Lion King and Tarzan. It is as though the jungles of Africa is primitive as it gets in Disney World, as if how things might have been millions of years ago is beyond anyone's imaginings.
I cannot emphasizing enough how beautiful this movie is to look at. It shows us that CGI technology continues to advance at breathtaking speed. The camera flies through marvelous landscapes, the dinosaurs are fanstastic to look at, and colors are wonderful. One scene in particular, in which the dinosaurs' world is nearly destroyed by a spectacular meteor shower, is among the best animated sequences ever produced.
As for the story, I wonder how many of the head honchos at Disney actually have children of their own. One wonders if they make decisions based on the children they see around them or based on focus groups. Did it ever occur to them that everything that fascinates children is not necessarily cute and cuddly or, for that matter, even safe. When I was young child, for example, I fell in love with the ocean, not because I thought it was warm and safe, but for deeper reasons I could not express. I'm not sure what today's children think dinosaurs were like, but I doubt they view them as big old puppy dogs or as creatures with Judeo-Christian ethics. In this movie, the dinosaur that the lemurs save grows up to be one who teaches his fellow creatures that survival of the fittest is wrong and that helping your fellow dinosaur is what it's all about. Somehow, I do not believe that the average child will buy his argument, not when it comes to creatures in the wild. I think they will find his preaching a bit tedious. In assuming that kids take everything and translate it into a cutsey-pie fantasy world, Disney has underestimated its young audience's intelligence and has demonstrated that it may have become somewhat out of touch with its target market, at least when it comes to this particular subject matter.",1016323200,,3247,4.629116117850953

A nasty fascist dinosaur named Kron is leading the dino's to the promised land and he doesn't believe in committees. Old and lame must fall behind and die, it's the survival of the fittest that counts. But along comes a young idealist named Aladar (but they might as well have tied a red scarf around his neck and called him Che) who speaks of new ideas about cooperating with one another for the comman good. Everyone from Brontosaurus to Stegosaurus will be treated as equals and lo, all shall be bountiful in the garden of Eden. Inspired by this rhetoric, Kron's sister rushes off to join the revolution, much to Kron's horror. You see, Kron is like nowheresville, man. He ain't hip. He's a square. With a square head.

Anyway, we are left with Aladar and his comrades in paradise begetting new children. What happens next? Lo, some dinosaurs become more equal than others and decide to form a party. They get the share of the food and shelter. And lo, there was collectivization, another cultural revolution, famine and mass starvation. Then they were invaded by other dinosaurs (denounced as fascist) who were repelled and from then on everything went to a year zero. Dinosaurs were told not to question the way things were and any who did were slaughtered by the dreaded 'Dino Rouge'. Dinosaurs informed on other dinosaurs. Whole families of eggs were wiped out. The green paradise became polluted and fell into disrepair. But Comrade Aladar told them everything was well and that there was no turning back and that the people must love him.

2. Why is this Movie Backwards? - The biggest scene in the film in terms of effects and emotional impact is the asteroid destroying the lemurs' home.  Since that came so early on nothing really came a long to top that, the movie pretty much went downhill.
3. I liked it better when it was called ""Tarzan"" - Despite the lack of songs, this flick feels extremely derivitive, especially of the aformentioned movie about the guy in a loincloth.

2099339,5,B000055Z8E,"""Dinosaur"" is a visually stunning prehistoric adventure, told with amazingly detailed computer animation. The story centers on Aladar, a young iguanodon who is raised by a peaceful tribe of lemurs. After disaster strikes their island, Aladar and other members of his inter-species family must undertake a dangerous quest for a new home.
""Dinosaur"" is in some ways an old-fashioned animal tale a la ""Bambi,"" with an interspecies group of talking animal characters. Unlike similar films like ""The Lion King"" and the ""Land Before Time"" series, in ""Dinosaur"" there is a clear distinction between the carnivores (presented as monsters who do not engage in speech) and the other animals.
The visuals of ""Dinosaur"" are truly amazing. The filmmakers had me hooked with the stunning opening sequence, which features many different prehistoric species and locales. The animation is superbly enhanced by the outstanding vocal performances of a talented all-star cast. D.B. Sweeney is an appealing hero. Joan Plowright and Della Reese have great chemistry as a dino duo. And Ossie Davis is both grouchy and sweet as the lovable lemur patriarch.
""Dinosaur"" is a story of survival and courage, friendship and family. There are some scary scenes, but they are offset by many scenes of tenderness and humor.

2099340,3,B000055Z8E,"A Fable is a tale that often involves animals, but always has a very blunt moral or lesson to its telling.  The tortoise and the hare, for example, always ended with that line: ""The race does not always go to the swift, but to those that keep on running.""
Disney, with this movie, made a Fable with a message of teamwork.  In and of itself, the movie is a good, if straightforward, story.  Survival of the fittest vs. The good of the whole and working together come to vivid life with an incredible computer generated world of dinosaurs and lemurs.  It's cute, it's fun, and it's just scary enough for young kids to enjoy but not be frightened of.
It's also way too dark.  Not in a metaphorical sense, but in a ""I can't see what the heck is going on"" sense.  On my television screen, which is a mid-sized set, the night and cave scenes were more like voice-overs to a blank black screen than a movie.
So, if your child is up for a lesson in teamwork, this is a good movie for him or her.  But as an adult, I didn't find much to keep me going in this one (certainly nothing as on par as ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" for example).

While nowhere near as cool as Jurassic Park, it features dinos not seen in either Jurassic Park or Lost World, including Carnotaurs and Ovaraptors (my two favorite dinosaurs woo hoo)Some of the dinos are rather cartoony in their faces, but the carnovores all look very lifelike.

Disney should be sued by the writers of ""The Land Before Time"" for their blatant plagiarism of the plot.  One big difference though is that Disney should have spent some time developing characters the audience would care about.  My recommendation is to buy the ""Tarzan"" video which has a preview of the only good part of ""Dinosaur"", as it shows the first five minutes of the movie.  That way, you'll not only get ""Tarzan"", which is a better movie, but also the only watchable part of ""Dinosaur"".",993081600,,575,4.607843137254902
2099343,1,B000055Z8E,"My son and I saw the preview of DINOSAUR in the theatre when we went to see TOY STORY 2. DINOSAUR'S preview soared--the blending of natural landscapes and CGI creatures looked seamless and enthralling . . . until the rubber-faced simian peaked at the egg. When, months later, my son and I saw the film in the theatre, I felt that the majority of the creativity and ingenuity went towards the opening sequence featured so prominently in the preview. DINOSAUR's story, as other reviewers have noted, is so derivative that only a small child would be diverted by it; the more traditionally animated creatures in the LAND BEFORE TIME series have more charm, even if they are too sweet for the older kids. Unfortunately, this film has elements that many parents may deem inappropriate for small children; explosions and other violence will lead to wakeful nights.
I find it distressing that a company that can innovate so well, giving us the ""Deep Canvas"" of TARZAN and the wonderful alliance with Pixar studios, could not develop a better showcase for its technical innovations than this forgettable film. If you want CGI dinosaurs, treat yourself to the BBC production of WALKING WITH DINOSAURS (and watch it with your kids, too). If you just have to have dinosaurs in a cute ""friendship triumphs over all"" story, go with a LAND BEFORE TIME tape. But if you want to see something more than cleverly rendered, photorealistic dinosaurs, you'll have to look somewhere else.",992390400,,1467,4.895582329317269
2099344,3,B000055Z8E,"I agree with the many others who have also written reviews for 'Dinosaur'; it's VERY similar to 'The Land Before Time'.  I'll admit, the animation was great and I liked the music.  On the other hand, yes, it IS a bit unrealistic how one valley so similar to the Great Valley happened to survive, and that yes, again a T-Rex like beast had to be fought off and shoved into a deep canyon or something of that nature.  I also agree with a fellow reviewer who had complained of the sappy love story in the movie between Aladar and Nira; it was pretty much expected, and of course, Nira would be somehow related to the one who hated Aladar's rebellious nature.
Of course, it's not that I hated the entire movie.  I happened to like the part where Aladar and the herd used their numbers to intimidate the T-Rex like dinosour, (but then again, that could've been because of the music).
And I suppose one more plus would be this movie didn't deny the reality of death in that characters from the ""good-side"" DID die brutal deaths unlike mosther American animations and movies that are geared towards yunger audiences(all right, so they weren't important characters, but still).
All in all, the 3 stars are for the animation and the music.  Story could've been more original and was, well, just as my title expresses, ""eh...""",992217600,,1316,4.6068376068376065

2099346,2,B000055Z8E,"Well, my title pretty much says it all.  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because I'd enjoyed the look and sound of the trailer, very captivating! but the moment the _lemurs_ (of course, nonexistant in dinosaurian times) began talking it was a (pathetic) test of my plot predicting capabilities.  Every bad cliche Disney could throw in there is carried out to it's fullest potential, up to and including sappiest love at first water-digging lesson I've ever had the unfortunate experience of watching.  (I had to get up and leave because of the gag factor)  I think if Disney could have figured out a way to make dinosaurs kiss, it would have been done.  I won't give away any more plot (such as it is) details, but the interaction between the characters is something a child could write (perhaps one did?)  As others have said, the characters are all exactly 0 dimensional, their fates being easily predicted as soon as they're introduced and squashing any suprise you might have later on.
Another thing to consider is this:  Disneyfication.  It will test your limits of incredulity in this movie.  Our hero Aladar represents the most pure form of POLITICALLY CORRECT I've seen yet.  He opposes and eventually defeats the non-pc brother who sports a ""only the strongest survive"" approach to life.  Excuse me, but I don't think dinosaurs lived on this Earth for millions of years because they were NICE to each other, and even the smallest school child knows that.  Also, in this movie Disney chose to depict what appears to be the big one - the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs.  (This scene was one of the MOST visually stunning in the entire movie.)  Now, how is it that there is ONE little valley that just MAGICALLY survives what would have been a total blackout of the sun for years?  Disney didn't have to choose a disaster that is so unrealistic, it could have been anything from just a smaller meteor to floods, to earthquakes, drought, etc.  But the 'earth-killer' asteroid is so closely identified with dinosaurs that Disney choose not to come up with anything remotely original of their own.  Yes, this movie certainly tells the pay scale of hollywood moviemakers - script writers on the last rung of that ladder.
Finally, yes, this movie had excellent effects and looks.  Kudos to the animators!  But wax fruit looks good too, and there's no edible substance there either.",991353600,,2407,4.798543689320389
2099347,1,B000055Z8E,"Growing up, 'The Land Before Time' was my favorite movie. I watched it over and over. I had it memorized. It was an incredible movie. Then, years later I see 'Dinosaur' and I think ""Where have I seen this before?"". The egg sequence at the very beginning was so obviously torn from that movie. And that's just the first scene.
An orphaned dinosaur must team up with a band of misfits after a great disaster to find a fabled, fertile land where dinosaurs can survive, meanwhile being chased by angry carnivores. C'mon Disney. You're not even TRYING. That's identical to 'The Land Before Time'.
Although the digital effects are stunning in this movie, they only serve a purpose in the beginning and the end. The rest of the movie is just boring, brown and grey, made my eyes hurt after a while.
This movie takes 'The Land Before Time' and put's it through the Disney movie-making machine. You have the main character, a virtuous young male who wants nothing more than to fix all the wrongs in this world, the beautiful female that's in love with him and that you know will eventually marry him in the end (After he ALMOST loses a battle with the bad guy, of course), and you can't have a Disney movie without the cute, fuzzy, comedy relief. I'll admit, 'The Land Before Time' had a cute comedy relief. (Petry, the Pteradactal (sp?) that couldn't fly) but the difference here is that Petry was actually cute and funny. I didn't want to see him get stomped by a brontosaur like that annoying, knappy-haired monkey.
This movie is geared towards children, but I find it hard to imagine a child being able to enjoy this the whole way through. For kids, I would recommend renting... you guessed it... 'The Land Before Time'. It doesn't have fancy-shmancy digital effects. It was created in a time where movies had to depend on good writing, interesting characters, and enthralling plot to keep people's attention. And, you know what, it STILL looks better than 'Dinosaur'.
I realize that, considering this a review of 'Dinosaur', I mention 'The Land before Time' way too much. But it doesn't matter, 'Dinosaur' and 'The Land Before Time' are pretty much the same movie anyway.",991008000,,2167,4.705263157894737

The effects are basically out of this world! They jump out of the screen at you, the DVD is as good!! I couldn't believe it, I was stunned. The sound is absolutely perfect, the picture is faultless and in general the film is slick.

Among them is a young male dinosaur named Aladar, whom the tribe as befriended and more-or-less adopted as one of their own.
Aladar helps the survivors of the tribe across the wasteland that the asteroid left in its wake; they travel in hopes of finding a new home that they hope is out there, somewhere. Along the way, they must negotiate a series of obstacles and dangers.

2099351,2,B000055Z8E,"**1/2  How much you will enjoy this recent Disney production may well depend on which view of dinosaurs you most prefer:  the hard-edged, kill-or-be-killed, survival-of-the-fittest ""Jurassic Park"" model or the softer-edged, warmhearted and cuddly type like Barney.  Either way, by trying to have it both ways, ""Dinosaur"" emerges as an uncomfortable mix of National Geographic realism and storybook schmaltziness.
By now, we have all pretty much accepted the rather appalling sentimentalizing of nature that has become standard practice in virtually all mainstream animated films these days.  We are used to seeing compassionate lions, tigers and bears in such films, but maybe dinosaurs should really be considered off limits.  Of course, ""Dinosaur"" does feature some ""bad"" dinosaurs - i.e. those who act according to their real nature - because, like all dramatic works, it needs someone to function as a villain.  But when we find a bunch of furry pre-monkey type creatures befriending and then rearing a lost baby dinosaur into adulthood - and when we find that grown up dinosaur acting as baby sitter and playmate to the children of that mammal tribe - well, something tells us that we are going to be in for a rather sticky time for the duration of the movie.  (Think of this as ""Tarzan"" 65 million years earlier).  Ask not, for instance, what this carnivorous creature has been feasting on all these years to have reached its present size.  That piece of information is conveniently left to our imaginations, I guess.
The plot involves the trek to a fabled nesting ground that a group of dinosaurs (and a family of nondescript simians) must endure after an asteroid crashes onto earth destroying their living areas.  Despite some vicious attacks by predator dinosaurs, the tone of the film is decidedly gooey and sentimental, with the cloying voices in particular contributing to the bathos.  With their big sad eyes, mile-wide smiles and sunny dispositions, these dinosaurs register high on the sappiness meter.  We want to let out a big ""ahhhhh, isn't that cute!"" every time one of them speaks or looks directly into the camera.
As this is obviously a film aimed at children and families, I guess many of these criticisms are rendered moot in the long run.  And, yes, the computer-generated effects are truly remarkable (though nothing we haven't already seen in the ""Jurassic Park"" movies).  But as an adult writing for adults, I cannot say anything other than that this is a pretty dull movie overall.

It is very jerky, and at times, even skips the chapter completely.  My player isn't exactly new, but then again, it's not old either... we just got it a year ago. If Disney expects everyone to upgrade to the latest DVD players just to watch their movies, they can keep their movies.

""Dinosaur"" presents several incredibly intense scenes, including a meteor shower that wipes out a lot of living things, and several encounters with giant carnivors, during some of which they devour carcasses, all at or above the visual quality of the Jurassic Park movies. Furthermore, the somewhat realistic villain threatens several times to kill the hero, and actually tries to fulfill his promise in a later scene.
Outside the realm of stomach-turning realism, this is just a better-looking retread of ""Land Before Time 1 & 2"". ""Dinosaur"" shares an incredible portion of its underlying themes with those two animated films, and some scenes and characters just seem to have been cut and pasted. ""Dinosaur"" is an especially heavy-handed lecture on the virtues of sensibility, leadership, and hope at any odds.
We find Aladar the talking iguanodon crossing a huge desert with the rest of his plant-eating kin in search of the pristine Nesting Grounds. While the herd's inhumane leader, Kron, pushes to speed up the pace (""only the strongest survive""), Aladar helps out the exhausted stragglers who are at risk of being left behind - Baylene the brachiosaurus, Eema the styracosaurus, and a dog-like ankylosaurus who can't talk (sound familiar?). Furthermore, the herd is being stalked by two huge predators.
In most cases, the voices never really seemed to suit the photorealistic dinosaurs. The only characters who seemed to be natural speakers were the family of lemuroids. They also prove to be the most enjoyable. The film doesn't really take advantage of its incredible level of graphical sophistication. Except for some colorful scenes at the beginning, the rest of the film takes place in a brown wasteland. All the dinosaurs are one color - a muddy yellowish grey somewhat reminiscent of elephant skin.

Score: 83/100
Okay, I can admit that Disney's much-hyped release Dinosaur may relate a little too much to The Land Before Time series. It's not the most original piece of reptile work ever, but the $200m Dinosaur is still a fascinating adventure into the prehistoric world, and it's the most plausible to come out of the Disney studio in a long time.
Long before humans appeared on the planet, dinosaurs ruled the earth. On a little off-coast island, a clan of lemurs finds a dinosaur egg, hatching. Since there are no parents, the lemurs take care of the newborn, Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney). Years later, a medium meteor goes down close to the island and the shockwave forces its inhabitants to flee to the continent. There, Aladar and his family meet other dinosaurs for the first time as well as real dangers. The destruction caused by the meteor here has also forced a herd of different herbivores to move to a remote valley that can provide food and protection against the carnivorous predators following after. Since Aladar grew up with a different understanding of the ways of the world, his way of helping others first isn't accepted within the herd, but soon it is proven that reason may be better than panic.
It may have slight flaws in its script, but Dinosaur's enchanting story and striking animation style is truly flawless, making the film a pleasant experience for both kids and adults. If there are best scenes in the movie, enough though there is too many, the egg's journey is marvellous and eye-catching and the meteor crash is a truly horrifying sequence, one that you'll actually have to be holding your seat and your heart to keep the blood pumping through your veins. In fact, the title says it all - You have never seen anything like this. That's absolutely true, I have never seen such a captivating and amazing animated film that is based on dinosaurs and doesn't go too sugar sweet. The film can be dark and moody, and it can be bright and sunny, either way, it will continuously please the large audience it receives.
There are a couple of faults which stop Dinosaur from suiting to everyone's taste, but it kept me entertained with a fascinating style. If you agree with my other reviews of animated films, Dinosaur is an absolute must-see.",986688000,,2284,4.741206030150754

The story involves a bunch of dinosaurs who, because of meteors blowing up their habitat, must undertake a dangerous journey to an untouched, lush valley.  Sound familiar?  If you've seen ""The Land Before Time"" it will, since this is the exact same story, except with a few annoying lemurs (or some sort of monkey) thrown in.  The single worst moment in this movie which has many of them, is a strange lemur mating ritual that leaves the self-proclaimed ""love monkey"" all alone swinging on his vine.  The only good thing about this movie is the nice score by James Newton Howard.
In terms of animation, the CGI is decent and sometimes  impressive when in the recreation of prehistoric times with herds of dinosaurs roaming around and great looking scenery (filmed mostly in California).  Then, the dinosaurs start talking and the annoying lemurs appear and the movie goes downhill really fast.  Only the first 5 minutes are worth watching, and you can get that in the Tarzan DVD too.
The extras are okay, but the many features are all very short, so that if you add up all the minutes of extras, it's not very long at all.  The interactive menus are really HORRIBLE though, just like in the Toy Story Ultimate Toy Box extra features disc.  The menus take SO long to load that you will be infuriated by the time the next menu appears.  Why do they do this?  Who enjoys wasting time so that they can see animated menus?

2099361,4,B000055Z8E,"I thought a lot about this review.
I'm an animation buff, so I can well say that this film received the maximum rank on animation - the amount of details and thought that was put into every movement and shot is admirable, and the result shows. It is certain that the animators did an excellent job - even went down to details such as having the muscles of the dinosaurs vibrate when the foot hits the floor. Sometimes I actually forgot that this was an animation movie, and mistook it for a National Geographic feature.
The story, on the other hand, is rather disappointing. It seems like the development process stopped after the story became reasonable. The characters are only skin-deep, and it is frustrating for someone who had already seen a couple of movies before that this one brings nothing new to the screen. It's sad to notice so many 'deja vu's while watching, seeing so many thing that you have already seen before, especially that the main character - Aladar - is an orphan dinosaur raised by monkeys, carries a close resemblance to Disney's previous feature, Tarzan.
Two thumbs up for the music - it really hits the spot. The composer captured every moment so naturally that it fits like a glove. Nothing I say can convey the impression, so you might as well see it for yourself.
All in all, an amazing animation feature with a weak plot. This film - in itself - receives 4 stars from me, although if I had calculated my impression on the Collector's edition, I would have definitely lowered it to 3. It simply wasn't worth the extra money I added. The second DVD contains very little material, and I really expected more from a highly documented production such as this one to include more material. People purchase this item to get more information about the animation process, and I really feel like I wanted more.

The title may make it sound like an ultimate children`s movie,but it isn`t. This time,Disney has real blood in one scene and violence in another. That shows that this is definitly not a Winnie the Pooh copy. When I saw it,I was surprised of how frightening the carnotaurs looked or how realistic the movements were. I am a great freak of dinos so this movie was perfect for me. But there was one thing that made me reallly disappointed. That was the story. Almost everything was very similar to Don Bluth`s ""Land Before Time"". The dinosaurs were kids then - now they`re grown up. The sharptooth has changed its name (carnotaur)and the same thing for the valley (The Nesting Grounds). So I think they should have been thinking more of the story than just doing one about a dinosaur herd finding a new home. The film then seems boringly because of the desert habitat which occupies 80 % of the movie. To be really interesting to me,a film requires a good story. But there was many positive things too. The characters are pretty good,like Aladar,a funny heroe,Zini the lemur,the evil Kron and the old Eema. And the effects were about the best I`ve ever seen in any kind of film! And the music was probably the best I`ve heard since Jurassic Park and Star Wars.",984614400,,1416,4.623015873015873
2099364,5,B000055Z8E,"I saw the film on home video. I was really impressed and learned some stuff. This is so far the only  animated Disney film that I have greatly appreciated. Why? Because I believe that this was their first video that is not only for young kids but for everyone.  It rejected many of the Disney traditions, like singing in some parts of the film. That's also one of the reasons because I really didn't learn to appreciate their old ""tradition"". Dinosaur was a big make over! Even my whole family loved it!  The visuals were absolutley impressive and the best I've seen so far! The story and plot were impressive as well. It really gave me the idea what it is like in the cretaceous. It's not like Jurassic park, well, it proved that dinosaurs are killing machines, but humans and present day technology were involved so it somehow changes the atmosphere. And in Land Before Time, no humans were involved but compared to Dinosaur,  Land Before Time has too many childish content, I really didn't like that one. Dinosaur however, really has showed the viewers that life long ago was filled with ultimate hardships and violence. The movie also shows actual eye to eye scences of death, and it proved that long ago is not what it seemed.  The voice actors and actresses were great! The voice of Sweeny fits the traits of the Iguanodon, Aladar.  Woodard's voice and the others were as good as the one I'ved mentioned. One thing that I want to thank Disney is that they made the dinosaurs talk. At first I though they didn't because when I saw a short preview of it in Disney channel, I heard no voice, just roars and growls. Them talking helped me understand the situations, what they feel, personalities and what they are like in the inside. Otherwise, how could anyone get even a bit of the story?  I also loved the Lemurs!  Anyways, I loved the movie! Thank you very much Disney!
I have an answer to why some people like this movie or not. It's because people have different ""tastes"" when it comes to movies. One thing, I know for some of the viewers, some expect complex plots. In my opinion, life long ago isn't suppose to be complex because the only thing creatures work on is ""survival""",984355200,,2186,4.544529262086514

2099366,4,B000055Z8E,"Certainly a master piece in terms of animation.  Incredible to the point where you have to clear your eyes in amazement as to how real the characters seem.
The story line is ""cute"" yet it carries on for too long and there are times where you can almost loose interest and give it up, this specially when you expect amovie of this kind (Disney) to be full of adventure, songs, and ""jumping around"" at all times.
I have a 2 1/2 year old and even though perhaps a bit to young to ""understand"" a movie about dinosaurs, I thought It would be a piece she would enjoy because of the scenery, and the characters (lemurs -monkeys-); well I had to stop the movie almost within 2 minutes into it, because there are some scenes that are a bit ""cruel"" although real, perhaps unnecessary in a film of this nature.  For the most part during the rest of the movie, this turned out to be not so bad, and we continued the show.
Yes, the plot is a bit long and there are not many ""cool"" scenes, just a lot of very good animation and at points some sound effects that are worth sitting thought.
I would recommend ""screening"" the movie before you play it for younger audiences, don't let this movie surprise you; just because it is from Disney doen't mean it is all nicey!",983404800,,1251,4.319148936170213

VERY SMALL AGE BRACKET:  The movie is so childish, that is will turn off adults.  Most family films have themes that adults can enjoy, but this doesn't.  Yet this movie contains some mild to moderate VIOLENCE, WHICH MAKES THE APPROPRIATE AGE ABOUT 7-10 YEARS OLD.
THERE IS NO REAL STORY OR CHARACTERS:  The characters have too much dialogue that doesn't really show their personality.  They are hard to relate to (not because they're dinosaurs, but because they're shallow).  The wonderful special and visual effects only satisfy for the first 15 minutes.

2099373,5,B000055Z8E,"Disney's next classic for sure...
The animation in this film is so spectacular. From the opening sequence to the music, the characterizations...everything is done in top Disney form.
The animals look and sound as if they are right in your living room and are so incredibly life-like. You can almost feel the scales of their skin in the close-up shots.  I was impressed with the quality of the scenes, particularly when they are ""on the march."" There are a view angle shots that give you an idea of how enormous these creatures were.
This is not a re-hash of Jurassic Park or The Land Before Time. In this movie you can see the skin move when they roar, the delicate lines that form very dry scaly skin as they wander in the desert in search of water.
The story revolves around an iguanodon named Aladar who is raised by lemurs (I thought it was touching when he introduced an older male lemur as his ""grandfather"").
Aladar experiences a range of emotions and life lessons that we can all relate to: family relationships, loneliness (he is the only dinosaur in ""lemur land"" at the beginning), survival choices, leadership decisions, and confrontations with both carnotaurs (described as meat eating dinos with ""a whole lot of teeth with a bad attitude"" by one of Aladar's dino friends), and a ruthless, egotistical adversary (the herd leader named Krone). And to make matters worse, the one ""woman"" Aladar loves calls him a ""jerk-a-saurus"" in public (and she happens to be Krone's sister)
The technology used in this film is far superior than other animated dinosaur classics, and the story line is much more engaging.
Very highly recommended.
P.S. The music is spectacular as well!

You can point your finger at the DVD player, but the real question is why did Disney release a disc that clearly is troublesome for so many players.  Two different copies did not work on the four DVD players I tried (including the one on my computer, so even that is not a universal solution). Disney needs to fix this problem and provide free exchange somehow.  MGM had a similar problem with a James Bond disc (Man with a Golden Gun) which only surfaced on some players - they provided for free exchage through the mail.

Young children (and even some anxious older children and adults) are likely to be frightened by several of the scenes in this movie.  This is because Disney has done a fine job at creating a visually stunning world of 3-D dinosaurs which are very realistic.
It is an entertaining film with a good morale storyline to it, but it is quite violent in places, though never gory.  I enjoyed the movie and will watch it many times, though probably never before bed time.  :)",982627200,,554,4.349514563106796
2099378,1,B000055Z8E,"Okay let's start at the beginning.
1)The story is pointless, unoriginal, boring, and little to no action or comedy.
2)The animation is bland and boring, the effects are WAY over rated and look very drab and colorless. The dinosaurs look rediculous when they talk, only three were animated very well. (Brontasauras, The triceritop one I forget the name, and that little one named URL who for some reason acted like a DOG because he was smaller than the others which I guess made him stupid?)
3)No lush backgrounds, just dull boring dessert which adds to the depressing feeling the movie had, and added to the dullness of the dinosaurs colors. The only beautiful shots were in the beginning and end, when the jungle was there. Plus alot of Dinosaurs get killed in the film.
4)Everything happened so fast, you get about 10 minutes of jungle and green till it's all desert, and there is no sense of location. Did the whole thing get scorched? how come this ONE piece of land was able to survive?
5)The characters were cookie cut out predictable, the villians were not given voices and just made dumb animals who want to kill. Unlike such classic Disney villians who were intelligent and had great motives for there evil. IE: Scar & Frolo (Hunchback)
6)No highlights, highly forgettable. And its a shameless copy of the Land before time.
Don't waste any money on this, but people are so naive to love everything Disney does, I think the world is under some great mind control. Disney's quality of films have been diminishing greatly, ever since they lost there ""Musical-esque"" style after THe Hunchback of Notredame.

I was wondering how they realized the texture and details of nature on computer. But it was only my ream--most of them except characters were just a digitized image of here and there. Already lots of people have done that and lot of them has good story too. The worst was that the advertisement before you get to the menu. I always hated those and this DVD has about 7 of them.

If you are a dino or SFX fan, this movie is probably worth watching for that reason alone.  But I was rather disappointed in the story--although it entertained my 10 year old daughter, the rest of the family was left unimpressed.  Usually one can count on Disney for entertainment that cuts across the generations (remember Aladin?) and even though the stories are often sentimental, they are beautifully done sentiment--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, etc.  Perhaps my inability to empathise with our doomed reptilian forebears prevented my wallowing in saurian sentiment, but I never had any sense that the villan of the piece was particularly villanous, nor did I ever particularly relate to the hero of the piece.

It is nice to see a movie where someone younger gives so much care and respect to the elderly. It is a great picture to teach children that we have a lot to learn from our elders.

2099408,4,B000055Z8E,"I don't know why there are so many people bad-mouthing this movie. ""The story isn't original."" So? Come on-how many Disney movies are original? All are based upon centuries-old tales. In fact, Disney has been re-using the classic ""hero's journey"" tale-you know, a child going through the rites-of-passage to become an adult-as the staple for their entire film franchise. Don't expect a revolutionary divergence in classic story-telling here.
What is revolutionary is the picture; the melding of live backgrounds and digital dinosaurs is very, very good. Not perfect (in some shots, the dinosaurs stand-out like a sore thumb, being too light in color compared to a darker and more detailed ""real world""), but amazing nonetheless.
What really bugs me, however, is that after a breathtaking opening sequence showing the journey of the egg, I was let-down by the fact that the critters talk! I know this is a kids movie, but since Disney is marketing this directly at kids, maybe they shouldn't have made everything look so realistic. It's a fine-line to walk, and I think Disney tripped-up a bit here.
Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie for kids and adults. While some may see this as pure eye candy, Disney's route was to follow the path of tried-and-true success of the hero's journey tied with cutting-edge digital artistry.",981072000,,1329,5.045454545454546
2099409,3,B000055Z8E,"I purchased this movie when it released based on the trailer I saw in the theatre (which accentuated the visual aspects of the movie).  I was not let down in that regard, the blend of real world locations and computer animation is seamless and beautiful. What left me cold was the story.  The characters are interesting (such as the Brontosaurus and Triceritops) but the story all to often falls into cheezy pop-culture references.  It almost seems as if Disney spent all their time on the visuals and NO time developing a compelling story.  You may be thinking ""Yeah, but it's a Disney movie..."" but all of the adult overtones that make other Disney movies soooo enjoyable for grownups(as seen in Toy Story 1&2, Lion King, etc.) are missing in Dinosaur.  Being a huge fan of Disney and Disney movies for this reason (I am male, 23 no kids, by the way) I was dissapointed.
Now, that doesn't mean that kids won't love it.  Children are pretty forgiving of cheesy stories, so they will definately enjoy it.  The problem will come when the kids want to watch Dinosaur over and over again (I'm having flashbacks of my little sister watching ""Little Mermaid"" every day for SIX MONTHS... I can still sing along to every song in that movie..).  The first viewing will be entertaining for adults, but after three times, you'll be ready to ""lose"" this DVD accidently.",980985600,,1358,4.70042194092827

2099411,4,B000055Z8E,"Dinosaur is really an odd kind of movie in a few ways.  On the one hand the 3D graphics are gorgeous and the landscapes are picked and filmed well.  On the other hand the two do not blend together as well they could.  There are many times in the movie where you can really see that the dinosaurs are placed over top the landscapes and it does take you out of the movie if even for a few moments.  Another thing is the story itself.  Many people will recognize the basic background story as that of ""A Land Before Time"" (The first one, not all the sequels).  However, Dinosaur is enough of its own movie that its worth seeing anyway.  And, besides, there really are only three types of dinosaur movies you can make: 1) the type where Dinosaurs meet Humans (ie: Jurassic Park) 2) The End of the age of dinosaurs (Land Before Time, Dinosaur) or 3) the documentary (Walking with Dinosaurs).  Anything else really wouldn't work.  But while we're on the story, I might also mention one other thing about it: its entirely predictable.  When I was watching it the first time I remember being able to say ""Oh, here is the scene where they are going to get together and use team-work"" or ""That's how they're going to defeat the Carnotaur"".  A kid would not be able to figure it out, but anybody over 13 should be able to with ease.  Another thing that needs to be mentioned is the idealogy portrayed by this movie.  The Darwinistic leader of the herd is pretty much the bad guy of the film, aside from the two Carnotaurs.  I must disagree with the portrayl of him because in the situations presented to him all the way up until the end he actually makes the right choices and is doing what needs to be done, but he is shown as a bad guy because of it.  Its an annoyance to see this, but because this is directed at kids the brutal nature of darwinism cannot be ""good"".  But even with that this film is fairly brutal at times.  I can think of 7 different dinos that die throughout this film off the top of my head, all but 2 of them never get any real screen time but it is still fairly harsh for a kids movie.  Still, despite all that, it is an entertaining movie and a good watch (you should watch it before your kids so you can decide whether or not it is suitable for them).
 Moving on from the story I should mention the features on the Special Edition.  Well, to begin with the stuff on the first disk (aside from the Commentaries and the FX track) is all pretty much unimportant.  But the aforementioned FX track and commentaries are very interesting and you should certainly listen to them.  Disc 2, on the other hand, is an awesome resource.  It really is a guide of the movie from the beginnings of pre-production all the way up until post-production, and every thing you could think about has been included.  The only unnessacary part was the trailers/teasers, which probably should have been on the first disc with all the other Disney trailers (including one for the upcoming Atlantis).  The 2nd disc alone is probably worth the price for anyone interested in 3D design or movie making.  Disc 2 I would give 5 stars by itself.
 Basically to sum up: the movie itself is fairly interesting and a good watch for anyone who likes dinos and/or CGI stuff.  It gets a bit brutal at times, which is kind of a draw back.  The graphics are truly hit and miss (though I must note that I am a graphics artist and I probably am more sensitive to these things than a casual viewer) in terms of blending with the scenery and the ground.  The second disc along is worth the price if you are interested in that sort of thing.  I would recommend this to most people, but only as a quick entertainment fix, don't expect anything really groundbreaking here.",980985600,,3739,4.383164005805515
2099412,2,B000055Z8E,"When I think Disney, I think about leaving the real world for 90 minutes.  A departure from the grind of daily life.  That includes comedy and light-hearted Disney animation.  Ever seen Toy Story?  Ok, Dinosaur is 90 minutes of dino-despair.  Every turn brings more death and depression.  Yeah, there's a happy ending, but did I even want to get there?

Good, if not derivative, film.",980899200,,405,5.106060606060606
2099414,3,B000055Z8E,"For its first 5 minutes or so, ""Dinosaur"" is a masterpiece.
It opens with one of the most mesmerizing sequences I can remember: a dinosaur egg is stolen from a nest, and travels from one prehistoric predator to another, eventually passing to a flying dinosaur, who loses it on a remote island. This sequence is absolutely exhilirating, and paints a dazzling panorama of the prehistoric world. It also blends technology with art and passion in a way we've never seen before.
It has us wanting more.
Then something bad happens: the dialogue begins. The animation, which blends live footage with absolutely convincing computer-generated creatures, stays brilliant throughout, but the heartless, kiddie-oriented, by-the-numbers Disney script sinks this film's chance at having any real emotional impact. In the end, ""Dinosaur"" feels more like a technically souped up ""Land Before Time"" than a real drama.
That's a shame, because other Disney films (notably, the ""Toy Story"" series, ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and ""The Little Mermaid"") have been able to combine technical prowess, stunning artistry, and a big, wonderful heart.
Still, ""Dinosaur"" is one of the most visually stunning films of recent years, and while it has a lame plot, it's quite entertaining.
The plot is pretty simple; Aladar is ""adopted"" by a family of lemurs (a non-existent species at the time of the dinosaurs, but, hey, it's a Disney flick) after his egg lands on their island, and lives happily until a meteor destroys the island. From there, Aladar and the lemurs have to move to the mainland, where desperate dinosaurs are searching for a new home.
The dinosaurs are led by the take-no-prisoners Kron, whose Darwinian outlook clashes with Aladar's politically correct sensibilities. Guess who wins out in the end? Gee, could it be Aladar? No, couldn't be...
Of course, there's the requisite love interest for Aladar, Neera (voiced by ER's Julianna Margulies, who was clearly in this one for a paycheck), who happens to be Kron's sister. Does Aladar win Neera's heart? Gee, I don't know...
And, finally, there's Aladar's quest to lead his rag-tag dinosaur friends (you know, the ones who couldn't keep up with that meanie Kron) to the promised land. Do they get there? My, I wonder...
If it seems like I'm being a bit harsh, perhaps I am; it's not that this film isn't entertaining (it is), but it could have been far more.
""Dinosaur"" feels like it was originally intended for adults (and some of the content, punched up in Dolby sound, is a bit intense for younger kids), but someone at Disney decided that the film was too expensive to take a chance on, and demanded a by-the-numbers feel-good kiddie exercise.
That's too bad, because this could have been a truly groundbreaking film that delivered on the sweep and promise of its first five minutes. Instead, it's merely entertaining kiddie entertainment.
Still, the visuals are absolutely breathtaking, and you have to give Disney credit for this. Without the visual innovation, this is a one or two star film at best; with the visuals, I give it three out of five, and plead with Disney to make the next such exercise something better.",980812800,,3158,4.9943074003795065

In the next building was an extravagant dinosaur exhibit, with large 3-d models, some robotic, and lots of other goodies. My kids were crazy about the whole experience and we have since seen this movie again at the local cineplex.  To my surprise my daughters have become total dino-freaks and play with stuffed dino's instead of dolls.  We have also seen most of the Land Before Time series and there was a lot in common with Dinosaur.(I don't want to say stolen). But realistically, how much plot do you expect involving large creatures with small brains, that don't actually speak, before the whole contrivance of talking dinosaurs becomes totally absurd as opposed to entertaining.  My kids fully understand that the extinction of dinosaurs is the key story about dinosaurs and even understand that this could happen to our own species. For that insight alone, I am grateful to Disney and other sources. As regards violence, they also understand that dinosaurs ate each other, just as the creatures they see on the Discovery channel.  Many Disney animated movies have scary parts.  Bambi's mother dies, etc. As  a five year old, I walked out of Snow White when the witch got nasty. This is part of Disney's formula and has been around for generations.  As regards accuracy, my kids are also able to spot historical inaccuracies such as dino's that do not belong in the same period, (but don't ask me which ones, I'm not that into dino's myself.)

The scaly skins, the vicious, bloody fights and the roaring terror of the baddies will cause nightmares, since they are not drawn with the usual warmth and fantasy of Disney animated features.  Whereas TOY STORY conquered the computer with a story and characters that benefited from the computerized realism, DINOSAUR does not.

2099432,5,B000055Z8E,"disney has always been the first for many things. they had the first full length animated movie with ""snow white and the seven dwarfs"". they had the first split screen camera with ""the parent trap."" they had the first computer animation ever used with ""tron."" they had the first computer animation/cell animation scene with ""beauty and the beast"". they had the first blend of live action and cell animation with ""mary popins."" they had the first full length computer animated movie with toy story."" they had the first full length stop motion animation movie with ""the nightmare before christmas."" now, they have the first ever all computer generated charectors mixed with all live action backgrounds.
  this is the story of dinosaurs right before these creatures dissapear from the eart, leaving bones as our only clues. many critics say this is the same story as universals ""land before time."" i don't think so. the only reason it seems so is because they both take place at the time of the meteors that supposedly destroyed them. it's very educational in informing children of the most logical explanation of why they all died.
  aladar gets stolen from the nest while just an egg by a dinosaur that plans to eat him. he ends up on an island of monkeys. he is raised there by the monkeys(sort of a tarzan story). a huge meteor shower comes, after aladar has grown up, and forces them off the island. all the dinosaurs must work together to get to liveable land and must out wit the carnatours which plan to eat them.

There  are some truly awe-inspiring sequences such as the 'egg odyssey' at the  beginning and the 'comet sequence' is remarkable in it's visual flare but  it is also exciting and a big plus to an otherwise common Disney film. As  with all Disney films, likable characters are introduced throughout as the  'good guys' and the 'mean guys' are more than easy to spot. Also what would  the hero be without some villains to fence off? this time they are two  scary-looking carnosaurs (T-rexes) who get their just desserts. Attractive  visuals and some exciting sequences make this an impressive family film  that delivers. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!",964310400,,805,4.860294117647059

I  don't care about the graphics one bit, and those of you who put them before  the story should just go watch IMAX movies and go ""wow""  throughtout the whole thing. Besides, since when is ""realistic"" a  good point in animation? This wasn't eye-candy. A Bug's Life was much more  of an eye-candy than this. None of the characters have any personality,  none of the scenes have any sort of spark in them. Just a shameful, grey,  mind-numbingly shallow film.

2099439,5,B000055Z8E,"This is a brave, new groundbreaking milestone for Disney: a completely  CGI-programmed story all about the very last dinosaurs struggling to  survive AFTER the fateful night of asteriods hitting the Earth, thus  bringing about the very mass extinction of all the species. Uh, is it  COMPLETELY CGI-programmed? The sweeping ariel shots of the prehistoric  world where a hungry pterodactyl carried a dinosaur egg high over the  craggy cliffs, the frothing waterfalls, the raging sea, and all are so  life-like I wonder if they are ACTUALLY shot as a live-action footage  rather than animated. If not...then...well, the Disney animators are just  one step from playing gods!
The story itself is hardly original because  it is very apparently written in the recognizable vein of Land Before Time,  Tarzan, and yes, even Elfquest. But it is at least told with many very new  twists that are quite breath-taking nevertheless. And I just love how all  the dinosaur and lemur characters are anthropomorphized, especially the  grumpy poppa of the hero's love interest! His whole face moves just like  that of a ear-boxing army sergeant, which I found terribly amusing! If  there are some parents out there who are griping about how the very idea of  dinosaurs actually talking ruined the movie, take it easy. This is a  FANTASY done from a very realistic perception. What's more, how else can we  learn the story if all the dinosaurs remained silent? And if you want a  serious scientific study of dinosaurs, just take the kids to a nearby  science museum.
Once again, this is a great experiment that Disney is  trying out to give their animation a new face. So it will be a bit while  for some viewers to get used to it. Like, for instance, there's very little  humor in this movie. But - actually, as long as the story holds your  attention fast, comedy isn't always necessary. Sheesh, do you REALLY miss  all those Broadway-style songs, wisecracking sidekicks, and slapstick  gags??? Oh, well...there's always a whole variety of animated movies, both  present and past (and surely, in the future) to choose from. But it's about  time for the animation to go even further and thus explore many different  ways to tell a story, folks. Otherwise, this is quite a visually stunning  odyssey into the unknown!",960768000,,2298,4.93717277486911
2099440,3,B000055Z8E,"Now that the adrenaline has worn off, it's easier for me to review this  movie with a clearer head. Okay, this movie IS exciting. In fact, it's very  exciting. Those that are easily excitable, like the little kids, would  probably find this movie extremely scary. The visuals are impressive. You  would swear you were watching real dinosaurs. The story isn't as bad as  people say. It's acceptable but not much more than that. We've seen this  stuff before. In fact, I think it was called Balto, and before that, The  Land Before Time. It's more by the numbers stuff. If you're okay with that,  however, then this movie should entertain. The movie is static and bleak.  In fact, it's one of Disney's bleakest movies ever. The premise of the  movie is simple--survival. I would say it was a little too simple. The  movie puts the characters in danger and keeps them there. There are no  fluctuations between highs and lows. This makes the climax hard to find.  This staticness is further aggravated by the apparent lack of humor. This  makes this movie very serious. The dialogue is simple, reflecting the  simple nature of the film. There are clear lessons and messages in the  story and in the dialogue as well, but they're presented in such a  straightforward manner that it's brutally blunt. We've also heard this  stuff before. ""Think for yourself, cooperation, concern for those  weaker than you."" So on and so forth. The characters are sufficient  but not much else. This is especially true of the hero. He's practically  the very embodiment of the messages presented in the story. This leaves  very little room for much else in his personality. The other characters are  about as dynamic as the story. Strange, though. The seriousness of the  story gave me just enough reason to care about almost everybody. Even the  ""bully"" seemed to have a spark of humanity. There was none of  that ""this is the good guy and this is the bad guy"" stuff found  in most other Disney movies. That was a refreshing change. There's just one  problem. The Disney cuteness is gone. It's been totally obliterated to make  way for a serious tone. I will give the movie credit for getting me  emotional twice in the same film. To sum it up, this movie is somewhat dry  and preachy but also very serious and exciting. It should be a blast to the  right people. I know I had fun.",960336000,,2360,4.652912621359223

2099442,5,B000055Z8E,"The new Dinsey movie, ""Dinosaur"" will blow your mind away right  at the start of the movie! Wonderful animated grafics! I would recomend  this warm-heartidly movie to anybody that loves movies.  The music in this  is awsome.  But the only thing that I didn't like about this movie, was  that it was just too short of an excellent movie.  It kept you wondering  whavt would happen from the very beginning of it, to the very end.  In the  beginning of the film, it shows the land where all the dinosaurs once had  ruled the world many, many years.  I loved that part, because they give us  so much wonderful, colorful details in the background, as well as the  animated, 3-D dinosaurs.  As he goes farther into the film, an egg is being  sweeped away by predators.  But soon it lands into a tree,a home where  apparently the lemurs live--a group of ape-like monkeys.  (But not exactly  like them of course. Just relative to the now-days monkeys.) In some ways,  this movie also is like ""Tarzan."" Once the egg was hatched, the  lemurs find out that it is an iguanodon, which they name, Alador.
He  grows up, raised by lemurs.  Until a gigantic meterite destroys the land  where the others were. So, the other herd was forced to move on to another  part of the land...the Nesting Grounds.  And they must watch out for  murderous predetors on the loose--like the Carnators, or Phalousaraptors.  Man-eating pretators will catch them if they don't stick together.  Featuring with the voices of D.B. Sweeny, (Aladar).  This movie is also  some what like The Land Before Time.  But other than that, Dinosuar will  make you feel as though you have just been taken back to the age of  dinosaurs.  I loved it personally.

2099443,4,B000055Z8E,I can't believe how the computers have taken over. Perhaps they will be  the movies of the new century. This is a movie adapted for children. It's  hard for an adult to rate a movie that is written for children. I can't  rate acting or special effects since the whole movie is a computer  animation. The story is good but I think the beauty and the beast or even  101 dalmatians are more entertaining. This is a good movie to see but not a  must-see. Do I make sense,959990400,,466,4.179775280898877
2099444,4,B000055Z8E,"As I stated in my review of the soundtrack, I took my family to see this movie the first night it was released. I'll have to say I was wonderfully suprised! From all the ads on TV I almost expected Land Before Time  digitalized. But from the opening sequence I was mesmorized. The characters  were interesting, the situations were thought-provoking (Well, as much as  any ""dinosaur"" movie could be), and of course the music was just  downright awesome.
Probably the only downside of this movie (and it's a  small one) is that the plot is a little predictable. Also there are a  couple of scenes that could be a little intense for the real young children  in the audience. However, that is made up for by the absolutely stunning  visual effects and cimematography. The opening sequence is beautifully  filmed, and breath-taking. I would strongly recommend this for any family  looking for a great movie.",959817600,,902,4.798701298701299

This movie I thought  was excellent--if only it could have been another hour or so longer.  It  was just too short of a great, suspence movie.  Woopie Goldberg does the  voice a female lemur.  Who raises her own family of lemurs.  But when  suddenly a mysterious egg falls into their home, they do not know what to  think of it.  At first, they were terrifed of what it might be, but soon it  begins to hatch after it's long and dangerous journey to the home of the  lemurs.  And once it hatches--they find out that it is an iguanodon, whom  they had named Aladar.  They decided it was best to keep it and raise it  (something similar to Tarzan) and make it part of the family. But later,  they find something spectacular in the sky: (Well it was fascinating at  first sight.) A great big ball of fire, shooting down from the sky.  From  then on, the whole herd was to move out in search of the Nesting Grounds.  They have to keep constant watch of predators, such as Carnatuars and  Phalasaraptors and other meat-eaters.  Also featuring the voice of (Mrs.  Wilson, from Dennis the Mennis; can't recall here real name, forgot.) who  does the voice of a Brachiasauras: or longneck, I guess you could say.

2099446,4,B000055Z8E,"Disney's new computer animated feature, Dinosaur, is a striking epic  narrative of the life and times of Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney). Though  the film is intended for younger audiences, Dinosaur retains a dramatic  captivation and sincere interest with the universal human needs for  commrodrity. acceptence, self-esteem, love, and leadership. These moral  values are allluded to heavly in the film's story and the character's  motivations. In the film's emotionally captivating opening sequence, Aladar  is tragically seperated from his mother. Following Aladar's egg as it is  taken by hunguary carnosaurs and fate to an island filled with mokeys,  Aladar grows into an adult where he is faced with the proctection of his  primate family and the alienation and suspicion raised once he finally  returns to the land of his conception. On the same parallel adults themes  of life and death as the Lion King, Dinosaur is not reccommended for very  young children under the age of seven or eight. Dinosaur is a potently  dramatic coming of age story that has intense vocal characterizations and  highly sophisticated animation to create a world so real and so vivid that  it story reamains fascinating from start to finish.",959558400,,1225,5.237113402061856

Dinosaur is a revolutionary film in its  looks, and feel. The opening sequence is almost like watching a documentary  on dinosaurs and dinosaur life. I was so enthralled at first that when the  animals started talking, I was almost disappointed. I know that it was  necessary for the movie, but the opening sequence was so wonderfully  different than anything that I had seen in movies, that it was nearly a let  down when they started talking. However, that let down was only for a brief  minute.
The rest of the movie is something else to behold, especially the  fireball sequence, and every time I thought I was watching a real movie, I  had to remind myself that it was an animated movie. That just added to the  splendor.
The story is a little weak (it feels as though it was lifted  directly from Land Before Time) but I think that is the only fault with the  movie. The voice talent was great and the background music superb.
This  is truly a great movie and one that will revolutionize movies in the  future. I can't wait to see what Disney does with this new style of  animation in the future.",959040000,,1196,4.41743119266055
2099449,4,B000055Z8E,"...but the story is not quite there.  Even the animation is disappointing,  in the sense that the breath taking views such as the opening scene (which  was also the long theatrical trailer) are very few.  Most of the movie is  much ... hmm ... smaller.  Also, most scenes lack exotism (which makes  sense since most of the background was simply filmed in various locations  around the globe.)  But overall, the animation part is simply great and was  beautifully done.
What bothered me more was the story, which is a little  heavy on messages...  The story is definitely one tracked, and there are  some weird inconsistencies: the plant eating dinosaurs of the herd are  intelligent and talk, whereas carnotaurs (?) and velociraptors are grunting  beasts (in that, they're also more realistic than the other  ""characters""...)
Note that I don't think that the movie is  ideal for young children.  The atmosphere is depressingly gloomy and dark  for most of the movie, with several violent scenes.  It also lacks the  usual cute Disney sidekicks...
Overall, Disney did a great job of  animating very realistic dinosaurs.  However, the movie is neither a  realistic picture nor a complete fantasy.  As an adult, I would have  preferred something more realistic, with less of a story.  If I were to  take a 5-year old with me, I'd rather have something ""cuter"",  with a simpler morale, and a more upbeat atmosphere...",958953600,,1413,4.944206008583691
