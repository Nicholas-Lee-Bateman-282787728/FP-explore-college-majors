8196091,4,B000QFAHCU,"OK a bit of a screw up here by Amazon. There are two products. One is a DVD called Gothic Spirits - 32 video clips and it is a companion to the DVD Gothic Spirits 2. Not to be confused with the CD series of the same name. Anyway, there is also in the series a DVD called Gothic Spirits: Live. Here on Amazon you can order Gothic Spirits: Live and Gothic Spirits separately but their review system won't let you review them independantly, instead it puts your review on the profile for both products. So this review is gonna be a long one as I have to cover BOTH products in the one review, knowing it'll appear on both product profiles. Sorry for any inconvenience. The review for Gothic Spirits appears first followed by the one for Gothic Spirits: Live.

Gothic Spirits
At 32 tracks this collection of video clips is certainly packed with a reasonable amount of value and ZYX Music is to be congratulated for pulling together this disparate bunch of clips all allegedly tied in some way, shape or form to the `gothic' sub genre. Which of course means most of the bands are European.

And all up this is a pretty good DVD to pick up. Sure you could just google any band that interested you or download these clips from the respective bands official sites but getting a bunch of clips together in such a format still has value as you generally only google a band you've already heard of. So if the price is right I'd recommend you pick this up, especially if you already know a number of the bands featured here (and if you are looking up this item you should be familiar with some of them already!).

Quality wise this DVD has a menu that is simplicity itself, no special features and it features a clutch of bands that are in there with the whole femme metal thing such as Lacuna Coil, After Forever, Krypteria, Nightwish, Xandria, Theatre of Tragedy, Tristania, Sirenia, Stream of Passion and Visions of Atlantis amongst others. But it also features good time Goths such as the 69 Eyes and there is also a number of grunters amongst the vocalists for those of you who enjoy such things.

As I say, this is a good collection of clips to sink your teeth into and perhaps discover a few new bands.

Gothic Spirits: Live
I have to give this three stars.... for sheer lunacy. Without knowing the track listing and realising this was related to the Gothic Spirits DVD's I picked it up figuring it would be just a collection of single live numbers by different bands. However this DVD actually appears to have been filmed at a single festival gig entitled something like Burg Adenburg Open Air. And no, I've never heard of it either.

Anyway what you actually get is a selection of a number of tunes by five different bands (sort of). These are;

Lacrimas Profundere - Sarah Lou/ One Hopes Evening/Ave End/Again It's Over

Corvus Corax - Ducia/Platerspiel/Saltarello/Chou Chou Sheng

Schandmaul - Kein Weg zu Weit/Lichtblick/Vogelfrei/Die Letzte Trote

Midnattsol - Infinite/Desolation/Haunted

Tanzwut - Bitte, Bitte/Im teifen Gras/Geisterstunde/Schattenreiter/Meer

And most of it is as bad as it sounds. But not in a way that I feel compelled to be unkind about. I mean opening act Lacrimas Profundere have one of those semi goth/semi emo chaps out the front with a ridiculously deep voice and you just know that he is supposed to connect somehow with the girls in the crowd like a diet Ville Valo. But heck, his vocal chords aren't his fault and at least they are having a go. Then nutters Corvus Corax roll onto the stage replete with all sorts of tribal instruments like a band of Celt troubadours... or something like that. I mean the din they create with their assorted drums and bagpipes and weird medieval looking flutes and crazy stage clobber is actually quite good. It's certainly different and you can see that while it's a bit of a hard rock and metal crowd the audience absolutely laps this stuff up. And I did too - partly because it is so compelling to watch.

Anyway, then some mob called Shandmaul cruise into view and they are almost a welcome relief as they are very much a straight ahead hard rock metal band who sing in German and their music inevitably has some gothic twinges. But the weird instruments are still there and they make a way cool contribution. And while I can't claim that they won me over into picking up their back catalogue they do benefit from being wedged between Corvus Corax and Midnattsol and this variety does enliven the DVD overall too.

Midnattsol are probably the closest thing to a `name' on this DVD and I was somewhat looking forward to watching them given their last album (as I write) scored some positive press. I must admit to being a tad underwhelmed but if you want to check them out in a visual sense as well as aurally then this is as good a way as any as they play their way through their allotted three tracks.

Then, surprise surprise, it's this crazy fellas from Corvus Corax back in action. Except this time they have cut down the number of niche category instruments and instead gone - at least partly - electric and mainstream. But not quite, they still lighten their load with flutes/horns and the nasal strain of these instruments actually weaves around the more traditional hard rockin' tunes to quite surprising effect.

All up I simply cannot go higher than three stars for this due to; perfunctory stage set up, no real big drawcard bands, one band essentially taking up the space of two on the track listing due to operating under two names and while the DVD has a very very simple menu there are no extras at all or even liner notes to let you know where/when this was recorded.

But Corvus Corax..... I simply have to check out some of their stuff! In fact this is a genre I need to find out more about in general so if nothing else I can thank this DVD for introducing me so well to a style of music I didn't know much about.",1261872000,3,5902,4.552830188679246
