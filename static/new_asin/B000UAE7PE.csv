2917395,4,B000UAE7PE,"To my knowledge, this set is complete as advertised.  I believe there were 31 episodes produced during the 1958-1959 time period.  There were another 91 or so produced during 1960-1961, bringing the total to about 122.  I don't know where the notion that Trans-Lux produced 260 some odd Felix cartoons during 1958-1959 came from.  That would have been an incredible feat, even if each cartoon was only about 7 minutes in length.  If someone has some evidence that there were indeed 260 shorts produced by Trans-Lux, I would sure like to see it.

The problem with this release is that there is no slipcover to hold the DVD package closed.  At least mine didn't have one.  So it can easily pop open.  The cartoons look excellent and the menu is easy to navigate.  If the packaging were better, I would have given it 5 stars.",1191196800,55,822,4.606896551724138
2917396,1,B000UAE7PE,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on this product. It really misses the mark when it comes to what the customer wants. People who are real fans, including myself will gladly pay for a set that really is complete. I hope that the publisher trusts Amazon.com like many of us do when it comes to getting valuable market data. Listen to fans and deliver what they want and you will profit also. Please hear us!

2917397,1,B000UAE7PE,"I sympathize with the sentiments expressed by Some Other Guy that it is misleading and improper to promote this set as COMPLETE when it clearly is not.

One of the ways I acquire a product reluctantly when I have some moral disagreement with the practices of the manufacturer is that I will only purchase a used copy of the item, not a new copy.  This insures that, although the manufacturer benefitted from the profit they received when the item was first purchased, at least they don't benefit from my purchase when I buy it second-hand used.  The net result is that they sell only 1 copy of the item, not 2.

Many businesses will not respond to comments, whether they are stated in a sincere and courteous way, or a nasty way.  It makes no difference.  As long as the money comes in, they could care less.  So customers have to be creative to get the point across to them that they should clean up their act.

It is possible to acquire a product and yet still not give financial support to a business that is engaging in practices that you think are wrong.",1191024000,17,1059,4.422680412371134
2917398,5,B000UAE7PE,"This is one great cartoon I remember from the 1980,s! This was one of the great favorites of my brother and me! I,m looking forward to owning this when it comes.",1188432000,3,161,4.225806451612903
2917399,5,B000UAE7PE,"I am very pleased (that's right, pleased) to be proven wrong in my previous review. With the help of Jerry Beck of Cartoon Brew, I was able to clarify some details about this set, that I was incorrect about.

Although as I claimed earlier there were indeed 260 cartoons produced, (a fact John Canemaker bears out in the interview included in this set) it appears that the set is indeed complete within the context of the 1958-1959 heading. According to Jerry, Classic Media is working very closely with the Oriolo family on this one and their information about the cartoons in that portion of the timeline (1958-1959) is right.

This means I owe the folks at Classic Media one big apology. Under the circumstances they deserve praise. While, I wish the set were larger, more along the lines of their HarveyToons release, perhaps they have their own reasons for doing it this way. I only hope it doesn't mean that the rest of the collection will remain unavailable. There are still a lot of great Felix cartoons still to come, including VaVoom! and the return of the Master Cylinder!

I defended the HarveyToons set (incomplete though it was)on the argument that while it wasn't really the whole shebang that it was a great value for the price. I will defend this set on the grounds that it is complete for the years prefaced and if not extraordinary value that HarveyToons was, fairly priced none the less.

It shares the same handsome packaging design that HarveyToons did and the cartoons all look great. Though some folks don't like the open book style of the sleeve (w/no outer sleeve) it seems just fine to me. The discs are quite secure in their holders and not likely to fall out. If anything, it takes too much effort to release them.

So, yes, I'm happy and hope the set does well so that we may see the remaining 229 episodes commited to disc. What are you waiting for? Place your order!

Now that I've finished this slice of humble pie, I think I'll have another with the folks at Classic Media.",1186963200,14,2006,4.605042016806722

2917406,3,B000UAE7PE,"When I thing Felix I guess I see the original black and white shorts where the plots and his actions were much different than these late modern feeling ones.
I enjoyed his usage of his thoughts to solve problems much more, like he would use the drawn symbols such as a question mark or exclamation point to do something.
Not complaining just observing a different style is all. I never did like the ""modern, minimalist"" style of cartooning that took place during  the mid '50s.
I guess the paying cartoonists and animators started to get too high back then as all the studios did it.
Even the very early simplistic toons were more enjoyable. And when multi-plane scenic shots were incorporated the visual pleasure increased.
But if this is the era you enjoyed, watched, and remembered, by all means buy and enjoy it you will not be disappointed.",1397260800,,845,4.70945945945946

2917411,5,B000UAE7PE,"When our son opened it up on Christmas and it was missing disc 1. the paper showed what was on the disc 1 and 2, but there was no disc 1 in the box when we opened it. the second disc was the only disc in the box. we sure would like to have the 1st disc as well. it would be nice to see the rest of the cartoons on it.",1388102400,,317,3.4166666666666665
2917412,2,B000UAE7PE,"It seems like most of the people who like this set saw it as kids and are nostalgic for it. I'm older, and my first exposure was to the wonderful original Felix cartoons from the 1920s. I'm a big fan of those, and I have a handsome porcelain figurine of Felix on my  bookcase.

To me these later TV productions are weak imitations, with limited animation, over-simple plots, and obnoxiously simplistic dialogue (I'd try watching them with the sound turned down--they mostly state the obvious), aimed at about the level of a five year old.

Unfortunately, since the old Felix is in the public domain, no one seems interested in restoring and reissuing the classic cartoons in really good prints; but since Betty Boop has gotten the deluxe treatment recently, maybe there's hope.

It was always a joy to see FELIX THE CAT take his little magic bag and do battle with classic bad guys like THE PROFESSOR, ROCK BOTTOM, and THE MASTER CYLINDER!

When it comes to cartoons now, I feel kind of sorry for today's kids. They are stuck with some very lame and some very sorry cartoon shows! The state of CARTOON NETWORK itself now is just plain awful and mostly unwatchable.

2917443,5,B000UAE7PE,"I'm a 24 year old Felix fan so obviously, I like it. It would be nice if there was more Felix because I would purchase them all. Please don't re-release these such as like the much older 1920's releases. If that's going to happen, I won't buy them.

Shipping was (like always) quick and a couple days before the estimated arrival! In other words, Excellent shipping! The product is very nice. Thanks Amazon and Felix The Cat companies!

If you're new to Felix like myself, if it helps, I also bought the Felix The Cat [Enhanced] DVD set. I was impressed with that one too. I was also tempted on buying Presenting Felix The Cat Vol. 1-2 but most (if not, all) of those cartoons are on the Felix The Cat [Enhanced] anyway.

A while back, I bought that Giant 600 Cartoon Collection which at least has over 20 Felix cartoons or more and many of them I don't have on any other set (which, if you think about it, is... pretty cool).

Please release more =) thank you!",1265932800,,961,4.351955307262569

2917451,3,B000UAE7PE,"I'm afraid it would take many psychologists many sessions to figure out what we saw in this when we were kids.  I recently purchased what professes to be ""The Complete 1958-59 Series"".  Turns out they're using ""Series"" in the British sense, what we would call ""season"".  In fact there are 250 some-odd (and I do mean odd) episodes of this floating around and this is the first 31.  There doesn't seem to be much in the way of plot (or art direction) except: Felix walks around with Magic Bag (Still love the natty yellow Yves St. Laurent-ish pattern), Professor tries to steal magic bag, Professor fails and punishes himself with one of his too-many-for-comfort home made self abuse machines, Felix laughs sadistically.  That's it.  I don't think it would hold the attention  of even the most medicated child today. The whole enterprise seems to have been translated from another language, but wasn't and clearly much money was saved on the endlessly rotating backdrops (same tree going by 35 times, etc.).  In addition to the sado-masochistic dynamic between Felix and The Professor (not nearly as cute as the one on Gilligan's Island and saddled with the voice of the sixties Popeye), The Professor and his assistant Rock Bottom appear to be cohabitating in the observatory, sharing a bed, with Rock Bottom wearing a frilly nightie!  As Rock is an employee of The Professor and, to some extent, a bulldog, this relationship appears to fly in the face of not only modern sexual harassment statutes, but a few of natural law as well.  And what about the bag?  Nothing ever appears to come out of it, but Felix can shape it into an array of other things.  So why is it a bag if nothing's in it?  Can it just be the convenience of handles?  We won't even get into the sudden appearance of ""Nephew"" Pointdexter.  Suffice it to say, I wouldn't babysit for the ward of someone who always trying to shrink and liquidate me and take my stuff.  Sadly, Vavoom the explosive mouthed Inuit guide is nowhere to be found on this collection, but a nifty documentary on Felix through the ages and the uber-catchy theme song in other languages is great fun.

2917454,5,B000UAE7PE,"Let's get this issue of ""260 episodes"" out of the way. Each ""episode"" of this show consisted of a first half with a cliffhanger pause and then a second half. The pause was there to allow a commercial, but the disc of course has no commercials, and so you get seven minute episodes with a minor ""blip"" in the middle. This DVD set is the first season of what was 130 episodes of the show, a number that tallies from lists in Lenburg's cartoon encyclopedia and elsewhere make clear.

And what a deliciously weird cartoon this was. The limited animation and UPA graphics become an aesthetic in themselves. Felix is, if we may overanalyze a bit, a fascinating abstraction, an oddly disconnected and almost pathologically happy being who serves only to frustrate ""The Professor,"" who wants this magic bag Felix carries, although we are not told where Felix got the bag or what his purpose with the bag is except to be protected from anything the Professor pulls.

The voice work is also neat. Popeye's Jack Mercer does both Felix and The Professor (as well as later additions Poindexter and Rockbottom). You can hear echoes of Popeye now and then in the rendition of The Professor, and occasionally, Felix speaks without mouth movement a la the ad-libbing in the earliest Popeye cartoons, and The Professor garbles here and there in a way reminiscent of Popeye's ""scatting.""

At the end of each one, Felix squawks ""Righty-oh!"" and then does a trademark laugh that anyone who grew up watching TV in the sixties or seventies remembers fondly -- but which is oddly detached from what went on before. Felix is primally attached to seeing his assailant defanged to the point of this ritual celebration of such with us, every single time -- ""Righty-o! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HAH!!!"" But ""Righty-o"" what? What was ""Righty-o""? And why the laughter when often Felix had been close to death a minute before?

These cartoons are not only cheap, but vaguely surreal -- people partaking of mind-altering substances would thoroughly enjoy hitting ""Play All"" and watching endless ones in sequence. I, for one, have seen them more or less sober, but still urge folks to check out how the Felix we remember from our childhoods is actually a tad psychedelic.

2917455,5,B000UAE7PE,"At last, Classic Media does pull a rabbit...err cat...out of the hat, and what a glorious set, containing what is considered to be the full run of cartoons in this series from 1958 through 1959.  It doesn't suggest this, but it is my hope that the run is continued to include the cartoons created from 1959 to 1960 and from 1960 to 1961, because I'd seen other toons in the series issued on VHS that included VAVOOM and there was also a great Felix birthday party episode.  If it is true that Classic Media is working closely with the Joe Oriolo estate to keep this treasured series alive, then I'm sure that we will see the rest.

This treasury is especially a tribute to the voice work of Jack Mercer who provided all the voices here.  Perhaps a special feature on a forthcoming second volume, if proposed, is some history on the man behind the voices, along with that great bit of film played often on syndication that had Mercer, in his besst cliffhanger voice, stating ""what will happen next to Felix the Cat?  Tune in and find out...""

For now, however, this is a jewel in the crown.  Let's continue to see what else that little bag of tricks can do!",1192752000,6,1156,4.4245283018867925
2917456,4,B000UAE7PE,"There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this set, even before its appearance. Most of that centers around the claim on the cover to include ""The Complete 1958- 1959 Full- Color Series"". This set includes 31 episodes, a far cry from the 260 supposedly created. So what's going on? The Felix cartoons of this era are widely believed to run about four minutes each. The ones in this set run about seven minutes, almost twice as long. Possibly each episode was originally run in two parts. In that case, there would really have been 260 parts, making up 130 two- part episodes.

John Canemaker, in Felix: The Twisted Tale of the World's Most Famous Cat, writes that Joe Oriolo's original plan was to create 260 episodes that could run as four minute individual episodes or a continuing quarter hour, depending on the station format. Many cartoons of the time ran as ""cliff-hangers"", multi- part stories that dropped off at the end of the episode, including Ruff and Reddy, Crusader Rabbit, and Underdog. This was so that the clowns and spacemen who were the live hosts of kids' TV could sprinkle cartoon shorts throughout their shows, which ran from Fresno to Binghamton. Oriolo's revival cartoon arguably had little to do with the original Pat Sullivan/ Otto Mesmer film shorts, but it was Joe who gave Felix his magic bag along with the show's personnel, which included the Professor, Poindexter, Rock Bottom, and Master Cylinder. Oriolo tried to follow the Hanna- Barbera successes of limited animation, and deliberately aimed his show at kids, which may be why it has remained such a favorite.

This set is beautifully packaged, with a graphic of the iconic cat on the cover, and includes a list of episodes. The case opens like a book and contains two one- sided discs. The plastic around the discs isn't very strong, and my set arrived with the plastic broken, but the discs still played OK. Disc one opens with ads for Rocky and Bullwinkle DVD sets and the Veggie Tales movie, The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, and includes 16 Felix episodes running about seven minutes each, for a total disc running time of 120 minutes.

Disc two includes the remaining 15 episodes and three special features. These features are the same as on the Felix the Cat Collectors' Edition issued in 2001 through Sony Wonder. They include the first Felix cartoon, ""Feline Follies"" from 1919; an excellent interview with John Canemaker on the history of Felix called ""Through the Ages""; and an archival promo reel for stations to use, including an ad in French and a black and white ad in Spanish (The Collector's Edition also included other features not on this set). The second disc running time is 112 minutes. The Collector's Edition included ten episodes on a single one- sided disc. On this set they are episodes number 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 21, 27, 29, and 30.

The episodes include;

Disc one: 1. The Magic Bag; 2. Into Outer Space; 3. Abominable Snowman; 4. Felix Out West; 5. Electronic Brainwasher; 6. Felix the Cat Suit; 7. Do- It- Yourself Monster Book; 8. Blubberino the Whale; 9. Ghostly Concert; 10. Captain No- Kiddin'; 11. Felix in Egypt; 12. Detective Thinking Hat; 13. Balloon Blower Machine; 14. Friday the 13th; 15. Stone Making Machine; 16. Penelope the Elephant.

Disc Two:  17. The Money Tree; 18. Oil and Indians Don't Mix; 19. The Glittering Jewels; 20. The Gold Car and County Fair; 21. Sheriff Felix VS. the Gas Cloud; 22. Felix's Gold Mine; 23. How to Steal a Gold Mine?; 24. Private Eye Felix and Pierre Mustache; 25. The Gold Fruit Tree; 26. The Flying Saucer; 27. Felix Baby- Sits; 28. Instant Money; 29.

Although I agree with previous reviews that the packaging could be a tad better, all in all I was quite pleased with this set.

As to the dispute over whether or not this is a complete 1958-1959 set, I found the following information via the net, to wit:

""In 1953, Official Films purchased the Sullivan-Messmer shorts, added soundtracks to them, and distributed to the home movie and television markets. Messmer himself pursued the Sunday Felix comic strips until their discontinuance in 1943, when he began eleven years of writing and drawing monthly Felix comic books for Dell Comics. In 1954, Messmer retired from the Felix daily newspaper strips, and his assistant Joe Oriolo took over. Oriolo struck a deal with Felix's new owner, Pat Sullivan's nephew, to begin a new series of Felix cartoons on television. Oriolo went on to star Felix in 260 television cartoons distributed by Trans-Lux starting in 1958.""

Felix starred in 260 cartoons by Trans-Lux ""starting"" in 1958.  So perhaps this is the entire run of Trans-Lux Felix cartoons from the stated time frame after all.

At any rate, it's great to have the tricky cat back.

8212481,5,B000UAE7PE,"A great collection of cartoons from one of the favorite cartoon cats of the ""baby boomer""generation, Felix. Relive the many adventures of Felix, who along with his famous Magic Bag of Tricks, attempt to survive the numerous traps set by his nemeses, The Professor, and Rock Bottom in their never-ending greedy efforts to steal Felix's Magic Bag. Also making appearances in some of the cartoons in this set is The Professor's ""genius nephew"", Poindexter. Of course, as always, Felix manages to thwart their attempts and keep himself and his Bag safe and sound.
 Back in the days when I watched Felix on television,we had black & white TV but now all these cartoons are in glorious color!  This set includes 2 DVDs and runs a over 3 hrs., 31 episodes. NOTE: Please READ some of the other Reviewers comments concerning the controversy over the ""actual"" number of episodes represented in this DVD set. I'm no expert in this area but I do remember as a child when I watched Felix on TV, often these cartoons were shown like a ""serial"", including a cliff- hanger ending at the end of each 4 minute cartoon. Then the story picked up where the cliff-hanger left off in the next so-called episode that was shown. I have noticed in this particular DVD set, each cartoon is longer (about 7 minutes or so) and appears to include the complete cartoon, including the cliff-hanger, all in one episode.  I highly recommend this ""Golden Anniversary Edition"" DVD set of Felix The Cat cartoons for anyone who remembers watching these from their childhood AND for the newer generations who have never seen them before (my granddaughter, age 6, loves them and has been watching them with me when she visits ever since she was 2 years old).",1432944000,,1718,4.739130434782608
