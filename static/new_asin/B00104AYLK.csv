8236712,2,B00104AYLK,"The other reviewer to this Alpha dvd Bob Steele double feature lists these movies as being re-mastered with double dolby digital sound. Now I don't know what he was watching but it certainly wasn't this dvd as BILLY THE KID OUTLAWED is nearly unwatchable and for completest only, as it's the first in the BILLY THE KID series. This movie is so dark and ""fuzzy"" that it's really a strain on the eyes to try to make out what's happening. There are also alot of splices, drop-outs, cut scenes and a murky soundtrack. Alpha could not have found a print worse than this and it's one of their poorest efforts.
As for SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, the second feature, the dvd wouldn't read properly and kept stopping so I couldn't watch it...Alpha puts out public domain films in nice packaging and I own many of their movies. Often these movies are hard to come by on dvd so I'm thankful for Alpha's output. Most of the time these movies are quite watchable, and as in the case of MOST DANGEROUS GAME, very good. It's hit or miss on quality and you take your chance because you want to see a certain film and it's really cheap (and did I mention the nice packaging?).
This Bob Steele double feature, judging from BILLY THE KID OUTLAWED is quite bad quality wise. IT'S NOT RE-MASTERED. It's barely watchable, and the dvd didn't play...But, I'm still going to buy another copy because I want to see SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, hoping that it'll somehow justify the cheap purchase price.

UPDATE, UPDATE...got a new dvd player and now SUNDOWN SAUNDERS plays perfect with no glitches whatsoever, so it wasn't a faulty disc, just the need for a new machine, 'though this is really the only ALPHA dvd that didn't read for the old player.
As for SUNDOWN SAUNDERS, it's the winner I was hoping it would be. The print is very clear, a few audio dropouts early on, but really a nice copy of another great Robert Bradbury, Steele's dad, B-Western, with lots of gritty action and Charlie King, Ed Cobb, Jack Rockwell and Earl Dwire to boot! And yeah, Charlie gets whupped-on pretty good by Steele! Great fun.",1255737600,,2068,4.589189189189189
8236713,4,B00104AYLK,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""SUNDOWN SAUNDERS/BILLY THE KID OUTLAWED"" (1935/1940) (116 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Bob Steele was an American actor --- He was born Robert Adrian Bradbury in 1907 in Portland, Oregon, into a vaudeville family --- Bob's career began to take off for good in 1927, when he was hired by production company Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Westerns. Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)
