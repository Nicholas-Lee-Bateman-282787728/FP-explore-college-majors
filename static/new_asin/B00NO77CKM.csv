6673398,4,B00NO77CKM,"Once you get past the slightly cheesy camera work, it's a good watch. I kept getting a few little flashback hits, as in the original Evil Dead.
If you're a Christian, you will feel slightly uncomfortable at first watching this, but it does hit the crux of what evil really is.
It's gritty, juicy, violent and chock full of profanities, however the story line is pretty darn good, AND, it has several comedic parts splashed in (no pun intended) for good flavor. You have characters in it you end up liking, and others that you don't, and they all die at the end except for the final two. I won't give that away as to who they are.
If you can handle the profanity, you'll like this flick.",1419724800,4,686,4.3671875

6673402,3,B00NO77CKM,"Yes, this film is pretty rough, and I don't mean in a hostel sort of way, I mean more in a ""We really had no money"" sort of way. The first 5 min were hard to get threw, accepting the ""Antichrist"" as a down on his luck type with a southern draw, takes a moment to adjust too. Over all the story was good (in my opinion). Four prostitutes kidnap a man whom they thought was making a large financial deal with there pimp, in hopes to obtain said money for themselves. Well, surprise, you just kidnapped the son of Satan, now what? Okay, the film knows what type of movie it is, and it doesn't try to be anything more. Thus is no ""Devils Advocate"", but it doesn't try to be. It's a pretty fun little low budget movie, with coarse comedy, demons, and violence. That's all. I can think of way wayyyyy worse movies (here's looking at you ""Bell Witch Haunting""). Grab some friends, and some beers and rent it, just once.

6673407,2,B00NO77CKM,"Josie (J. Scott Green ) is an underachieving Anti-Christ who has yet to reach his potential. He smokes pot and likes dirty hookers. Dark Gable (Chris Davis) is his connection. After a melee shoot out, Josie is abducted by four prostitutes who believe he has money. Josie's agenda is to have someone kill the infant of a Bronx woman who is to be the second coming of the Messiah.

The film had numerous scenes with blood, killing, possession, re-killing, more demonic possession with re-re-killing. In fact the lack of order within the film and the bloody chaos made the viewing less enjoyable as the goal seemed to throw idiotic blood at us for the sake of blood and gore.

The film had some good scenes and some humor that worked, but for the most part it was a poorly shot amateur attempt that needed a lot of polish. More of a slasher film than an Omen type.

6673431,5,B00NO77CKM,"A true spiritual successor to the original ""Night of the Living Dead"".

Lookin' for hookers, drug dealers and the son of the devil? Look no further. From the dialogue to the close-ups to the sheer gore-festiness of the thing, Hell Fire is a B horror lover's delight. It doesn't take itself seriously and that allows for the son of the devil to say some interesting stuff between bouts of hooker inflicted pain that causes his true demonic essence to wreak havoc on a the classic cabin in the woods scenario. I recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, cringe and question the altruistic nature of almighty God in the span of an hour and a half.

The acting was below middle school drama club level and the actresses ALL looked like junkies with makeup on... but since their looks kind of fit their whole pimp/whore image I wouldn't care about it so much if the acting had been even remotely decent. I think what turned me off on this movie the most was the acting by the Rosetta character lmao...I mean this was a latina with an english accent and she tried to act so tough that it was just embarrassing. Her actions made no sense and this was only like 10 minutes into the movie. Oh and the antichrist is some hippy escapee from Woodstock who sounds like the king of the rednecks... a recipe for disaster if I have ever seen one lol.... doomed to fail from the beginning...,1439424000,,840,4.425806451612903

6673462,5,B00NO77CKM,"This movie was crazy. I am a big fan of chaos flicks. Once the bloodshed starts chaos takes over for the rest of the movie. Because of the type of movie this is, it doesn't require a high level of acting talent. The characters are meant to be crazy so hiring actors that don't have a lot of experience is actually a good thing. When these crazy chicks get going they really take it to a new level of violent. This group of women are hardcore and they want a payday. They hear that a drug dealer that had killed one of the girls sister, Butterfly, is expecting the biggest deal of his life to go down. That is their cue to rob the loser. When nobody will give them answers they go to town on these scumbags. Except one, the Anti-Christ. They just think he's some hippy wannabe who is making a drug deal with the loser drug dealer. They have no idea what they are in for. They take him to a secluded cabin in the woods and start beating on him. After one of the girls is killed the Anti-Christ shows off one of his skills, and brings her back as a demon. Things go off the rails from that point and it kind of turns into a poor mans Evil Dead. Trust me, ED is a classic so I'm not comparing that way. Just using it as an example because of the crazy demons and the humor. There is plenty of humor in this too. A lot of corny one liners as two of the girls beat on each other. The things they do to each other is pretty funny. A board with a nail to the head. Mouth first into the corner of a brick at the base of a fireplace with teeth being knocked out like chicklets. All the while the Anti-Christ is antagonizing the girls and cracking lame jokes. The story was actually quite well thought out. Interesting storyline. Example: Anti-Christ tells them that humans were created by the devil, his father and that pissed God off. To get back at the devil God put souls in the humans so they were not demons anymore. Expel the soul and we are just demons. That kind of stuff. Cool ending as well. I really liked this movie. A hidden gem to me.",1434067200,,2038,4.123115577889447
6673463,5,B00NO77CKM,"For a low cost film, I found the acting very good and the actresses very hot. The gore was pretty intense which is a negative.  It was very sacrilegious but that was to be expected from the title.  The cinematography seemed very good and the fight scenes were well choreographed and intense.  I would have liked more nudity from the leading ladies.  Having several characters as the lead was in itself very entertaining. All characters were well developed and played an intricate part in the plot.  This movie might not be for everyone, especially younger viewers or viewers who might take the sacrilegious content seriously.",1433289600,3,625,4.914285714285715
6673464,5,B00NO77CKM,"The story is a strong, well written onslaught of witty humor spat out by comparable indie actors. The characters are, individually,  creative personas that come together in perfect insanity. Frattos creativity and ability to tell a story is stellar, as exciting as John Waters with Trash Cinema, and intense as Tarantino with his postmodern crime-thrillers.

The special effects are pretty tight in Hell Fire with some very gritty, realistic horror elements that will please any horror/gore fan. I was impressed, mostly because it is obvious that this is a low budget film so I was shocked at the higher quality practical effects used here. There are a few moments when CGI is chosen, but never enough to kill the mood or sap the Hellishly fun energy out of the film.

The only suck of Hell Fire is the very noticeable moments of poor sound quality during dialog scenes. Not always but it does keep the film from reaching 100% of its ""awesomeness"" potential. Overall Hell Fire is a killer action-packed, bloodbath of supernatural insanity, with an atmosphere of gutter trash avant garde. These are not people engaging or talking table talk by any means, this is back alley, trashy, real stuff that goes down after dark in red light districts. Which makes the fact that this is a supernatural battle between good and evil fought by hookers, pimps, druggies and the Anti-Christ that much more special.",1431216000,,1399,4.919491525423729

6673467,4,B00NO77CKM,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review.

The fine folks at Midnight Releasing have produced some true gems recently, including BLOOD WIDOW, SCAVENGER KILLERS, and SANCTUARY: QUITE A CONUNDRUM.  These have been great movies, and I have enjoyed each one.  They continue this stretch of excellence with HELL FIRE, an outrageous and ingenious film from director Marc Fratto.  I think this is my favorite film the company has released thus far, and I would even go so far as to say its one of the best.

There are so many things about this film that make it so awesome.  And while its not an overly complex movie, there are several aspects about it that will make you want to watch more than once.  I am already gearing up to give it a second look, just so I can enjoy it once more.

HELL FIRE is shot very well, and it looks great onscreen.  Im not sure what the budget was, but I don't think it was much.  The filmmakers do an excellent job of utilizing the budget they do have, and the result is great looking film that entertains.

The acting is top notch as well.  J. Scott Green portrays the Antichrist with a perfect combination of wit and Charles Manson-like cool.  The ladies who portray the prostitutes are talented and beautiful, and each brings their character to life with spunk and sparks.  I am impressed with the whole cast, as I couldn't find a single weak link in its entirety.  This talented group is a big part of what makes the film so much fun.

The special effects in HELL FIRE make other low budget films look shameful.  Theres plenty of bloodshed and gore to staunch even the pickiest of gorehounds, and it is all very well done.  The demon effects are great, and even the effects and gore from the fight scenes are impressive.

My sole complaint about the movie is a minor one; the sound quality is kinda bad in certain parts.  Just slightly so, but enough for me to notice.

Otherwise, HELL FIRE is a huge win for me.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a hellishly violent good time.  Chocked full of dark humor, over the top violence, and crazy characters, this movie will take you on the ride of your life.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1421884800,2,2214,4.409876543209877

8679464,4,B00NO77CKM,"Oh boy, I hope you're ready for this movie!  Not for the younger crowd!

It's about a man who is none other than the Anti Christ.  He shares his story right away.  He meets the devil as an 11 year old and teaches him how to read people's thoughts and memories.  But moving objects is hard!  The Anti Christ tells us a girl named Cinnamon pursuing her dream to become an actress.  She started pole dancing when her actress career didn't work out.  Dark Gable is a pimp and drug dealer.  Destinee had a Baptist Minister.  She gets pregnant and has an abortion.  She became a hooker.  Rosetta is mysterious.  Justine and her kid sister Butterfly both did drugs while pregnant.  Their father has sex with Justine.  They run away with no money or plans and become hookers.  They hook up with Gable, move into his apartment and get involved in drugs.  When Gable's money went missing Justine locked herself away for a month.  She moved in with Gable and worked for him again.

according to the Anti Christ today is the day he puts the world on notice.  We see girls talking about acting while smoking in a car and discussing their career goals.  These aren't innocent girls though. Just the opposite.  They're about to hold people hostage and commit murder!  One of the girls stole a gun during a sexual encounter.  She grabbed a bottle and smacked it over his the guy's head, and then she robbed him.

Anyway the girls attend a party as we hear lots of cussing, drug talk and sex.  Things get out of control and people get shot.  The Anti Christ guy is in the same room.  Suddenly a bunch of people are tied and taped to the floor while a woman holds them hostage.  The Anti Christ guy is one of the hostages.

The leader of this female group cuts someone's throat and demands to know where the money is.  More throats get cut.  The black guy won't stop cussing and screaming.  Cinnamon gets cut up in the attack.  The leader says she didn't come here for chump change, and this is one bad chick so don't mess with her.  We now see the women running in the woods. They're chasing a man who's going around cutting throats.  It was just a bad dream by one of the girls in the car.

So far this movie is very confusing with too many characters and too much talking  It's very chaotic too!  The girls drive to a house and set their bloody Cinnamon friend on the floor.  The other girls discuss what to do.  They think about burying her in the woods.  They kidnapped the Anti Christ guy and he's tied to a chair.  The black girl of the group looks at the Anti Christ like he's mysterious.  One of the girls smacks his knuckles and later his testicles because he isn't telling the girls what they need to know.  Cinnamon asks the black girl if God is waiting for her.

The Anti Christ says if he wants out of this mess it's all on him.  Satan and God are in our business since the day we were born making us who we are, moving us along one square at at time in this game of life.  Everyone has their own place in the game- it's just hard to figure out what side we're all on.

The girls argue outside over what to do.  Inside the house the Anti Christ knows about Cinnamon's story.  She watched her father die when she was 4.  He mentions pron stars looking for daddy's love by way of several years of sex.  He recommends telling God she won't be a bad girl anymore.  She takes her clothes off and the Anti Christ says God never gave himself for her, so don't do the same for him.  He asks if she blames God for the things he's done to her.  She says yes and screams in sadness.

The Anti Christ sadistically convinces the girl to rip the flesh off her chest.  She's now a bloody screaming mess!  The black girl thinks this is completely crazy but the other girls tell her to keep it together.  The one girl thinks she's losing her touch so she drills the Anti Christ's testicles.  When he screams statues around the house drip blood from their eyes.  Cinnamon drips blood from her mouth and stands ominously in the living room.  When one of the girls questions her she stabs the girl's hand and kicks her.  These ladies aren't friends with each other by the way.  No way!  This girl bashes the black girls head into a wall.  A girl points a gun at her forehead but she knocks it away and beats her to death on the floor while biting her hand.  So much is going on here it's hard to keep up!  Lots of biting and cutting on the floor with clubs swinging around to boot!

Somehow this madness ends while the Anti Christ remains in the back room smiling.  The girls argue in the bathroom about this man.  The Anti Christ interrupts the conversation and says he's the son of Satan.  He took Cinnamon's soul.  He says he can read these women's minds... in not so nice words.

The owners of the house (a husband and wife) walk through the front door and one of the ladies points a gun at his and his wife's head.  The Anti Christ possesses the one woman of the group and makes her say rude things to the two who opened the front door.  The black girl is encouraged to shoot the husband as his wife runs away screaming.  The black girl then tosses her gun at the Anti Christ'as mouth.  The leader of the girls shoots the wife in the forehead.  This is one chick I would not wanna make upset!  The two girls argue what happened to Cinnamon's gun.  D'oh!  She left it at the crime scene!  The girls discuss what to do and determine they're going to bury the husband and wife.

The Anti Christ screams loud after a knife magically gets thrown into a wall.  Blood drips on the floor on the other side.  The leader girl says to the Anti Christ that someone has to come looking for him.  The screen gets dark after this so I can't see what's going on.  I love the piano and guitar riff though.  One of the girls turns demonic that's for sure!  Unless she has a sore throat!  She pours water on a woman's face making her scream in confusion.  The Anti Christ makes the black woman stab her stomach to death.  The girl leader asks how he did that.  He says the demon was so strong it took over her soul.

The Anti Christ shares a story.  Gable made a deal with the devil.  This has nothing to do with the money the girls are looking for.  Gable did a job for the Anti Christ which would allow Armageddon to happen.  Itt's a fight over souls- Armageddon that is.  It's a fight over the human race.  God didn't create man- we did.  It took 5 million years to get the chimp to stand up right.  200,000 years ago we finally got it right with the modern man who is smart and imaginative.  Certainly nothing that got created.  He was angry and everything was a threat to its own instincts in God's perception.  The Anti Christ's father created humans to dominate.

God takes people's souls from the Anti Christ's father which upsets him.  The Anti Christ wants to get into politics until he's sitting on the nukes and an intern is sitting on his... lap.  He wants possession of those nukes to restore the human race to its former glory so he can party.  He mentions somebody's baby is the son of God.  The girl says ""Are you talking about Messiah?""  He sarcastically says ""No, I'm talking about the next host of the tonight show"".  A descendant of Satan can't kill a descendant of God or vice versa.  Gable kills the Messiah and we win the war.  All this girl has to do is cut the baby down.  She says she never killed a baby before so she's looking forward to it.

Her friend hears about the Anti Christ saying that he'll dropkick her (the girl hearing this) into her next life.  She then appears with a gun so the Anti Christ says ""I meant that figuratively of course!""  She talks about wanting to know things about God and the devil.  She's looking for a reason to shoot someone.  She wants to know where her sister is.  The Anti Christ says ""She's not one of my facebook friends"", lol.  She wants to know about God.  He says God's... the f word and a d word.  The Anti Christ mentions all the men who had sex with her.  He can read her mind easily.  He makes her feel bad about her sexual background.  The Anti Christ says God doesn't care about her.  He was laughing the day she was born and gift wrapped her to Satan.

The demonic woman from earlier is back!  She was upstairs all this time. She comes downstairs to interrupt this heartfelt discussion.  The girls beat on each other.  They trip up the demonic girl and she falls down.  They throw clubs at each other and go absolutely ballistic.  The demonic girl bangs the one girl's head into the wall and she retaliates by trying to stick her high heeled shoe into the demonic girl's forehead.  The leader of these women throws the non-demonic girl down the basement stairs and this ends the fight scene.

The girl leader in charge says the Anti Christ should use his voodoo on the girl she tossed in the basement.  He thinks that's a good idea.  She says she's going to pray to St. Anthony.  The Anti Christ says ""Pray to find the gun we're going to use to kill the son of God?""  she says ""Damn straight"".  He replies ""You're one twisted b!""  The girl leader and the Anti Christ contact someone named Babydaddy.  The girl leader needs Babydaddy to pick up a woman and bring her to their house because she has lots of money.  She'll give Babydaddy 200 grand for doing it.  He says he's babysitting and the woman says ""I never had a babysitter and I turned out fine"".  LOL!

When Babydaddy arrives the black woman won't let him in the house after he claims he has car trouble.  He sneaks through a back door and she waits for him. She stabs his hand when he opens the door.  She goes ballistic and throws everything but the kitchen sink at him.  She bashes him with a frying pan until he knocks her out.  The Anti Christ says he has to take care of the girl in the basement.  The girl leader recommends to let it hurt.  The Anti Christ takes his time allowing the girl in the basement to grab some hand saws and prepares.... but NOBODY can prepare for what happens in just a moment!

The demonic woman wakes up in the basement.  Huh, didn't know she was down here too!  Upstairs the Anti Christ takes a long time getting ready and so the girl leader in charge argues with him.  On TV the girl in the basement sees a man say ""I see you"" before getting sneak attacked.  She beats the heck out of the demonic woman with a bat!  The demonic woman wraps a chain around her neck as the girl in the basement coughs up a ball of blood that turns into a monster.

The monster forms to the size of a person in just a few seconds.  It smacks the girl around and speaks.  The monster says she's tired of being trapped inside of her and that it's time to move on.  The monster wants her soul and says ""Good thing I'm really hungry"".  The woman shoots a nail gun at a wall and the monster screams.  She begins to hear voices but tells the voices to go away.  The Anti Christ loves all the chaos going on in the basement.  He's upstairs directly above knowing what's going on.  The girl in the basement shoots a nail gun at the ceiling and up the Anti Christ's butt.  The girl in the basement and the monster continue to fight it out.  She beats the monster repeatedly with a club.  A tool flies off the shelf and goes right into the monster's eye.

The Anti Christ says to the girl leader in charge ""You might want to go down and check"" because he isn't sure the girl in the basement is dead.  The girl leader says she doesn't do basements.  The Anti Christ thinks she's a good woman so they go at it.  They make out while we see a woman going for a car ride.  It's the girl in the basement who escaped apparently.  The woman hits a tree while the Anti Christ says it's the first time he had sex with someone where he couldn't telepathically find her sweet spot"", lol.  The woman in the car takes a ride with the Babydaddy guy.

The girl leader wants to know if she needs a special knife to take out the son of God.  The Anti Christ says she can do it with a butterknife as far as he cares.  The girl in the basement who's now free outside tries to call on the phone for help but the conversation hilariously goes sour.  She mentions the Anti Christ and that they're hookers which doesn't make the conversation with the person on the other end sound very convincing!  Babydaddy drives her back to the house.  The Anti Christ and the girl leader get into a little argument.  Babydaddy asks the girl leader if she's a hooker.  The Anti Christ smacks Babydaddy in the back of the head with a baseball ball and the girl leader cuts his throat.

Before Babydaddy dies he asks the Anti Christ if he's a pimp.  He says he's everyone's pimp!  The girl leader and the basement girl are now outside and fighting in the woods.  The leader woman bites the basement woman's ear off.  She then runs after a black woman with a stick.  Just then the leader woman gets smacked in the side of the head by the basement girl with a board and several nails in it.  She really beats her good!  When the basement girl drops the board she steps on a nail, lol.

The Anti Christ says he thinks having sex with a supreme being would be life changing.  He says the one thing he knows how to do in hell is have sex.  He says the real Armageddon is not going to have a happy ending for God.  ""In life everyone's final scene is a b-"".  The basement girl walks inside and starts smacking people with clubs.  The woman leader walks inside and sees that an ax has gone through the Anti Christ's brain.  The basement girl tries to drive away but is attacked from someone behind.  The leader woman's hands start burning for no reason.  The Anti Christ asks who her father is.  Turns out she's the daughter of Satan while he's the son of Satan.  That's why he can't read her soul.  They're related.

They start to fight, and the girl from the basement returns from her car to fight in the home some more.  The Anti Christ uses magic to slide a gun across the floor towards him.  The black lady starts beating on all the women.  The basement girl bashes the leader woman into the floorboards.  The black lady kicks the Anti Christ in the forehead really hard.  She bashes his leg into the door really hard while the basement girl bashes the leader woman's mouth into the woodwork, busting her teeth.  Lots of ax swinging and gauged eyes.  The woman leader is eventually shot to death by the basement girl... and so is the black lady by mistake.

The Anti Christ thanks the basement girl, and when she tries to kill him she's shot in the throat by the cops.  The cops call this incident four prostitutes going on a killing spree and kidnapping and killing over a dozen people.  Wow the story at the end really takes itself seriously pretending this is based on a true story, lol.  The Anti Christ is interviewed later and says he plans to go into politics, but on his beliefs and terms- not on his 15 minutes of fame.  He doesn't know if he's going to run for democrat or republican.  He says he doesn't feel like a hero and thanks God.  If it wasn't for God he wouldn't be here.  Ha, funny choice of words.  The Anti Christ would trade his life for the baby who died... except the baby actually lived and is doing fine without the Anti Christ knowing about this.  The bullet missed the child by millimeters  Get this.  The mother didn't make it but the baby was born with a bacterial infection, and would've died if the bullet hadn't struck where it did, thus eliminating the infection.

Wow, if you like action... LOTS of violence and action, and a decent story with a bit of twisted humor courtesy of the Anti Christ, you'll love this!",1500681600,,15612,4.2793411118737135
8679465,4,B00NO77CKM,"Wow!  This is an example of what talented writing, a good story, and a few good actors can do with a small budget.  As someone who appreciates low budget movies, have seen way too many crappy ones that seem like they were not even trying, this one stands out.  The plot is not overly complicated, but has a twist or two that's pretty good, particularly the ending.
