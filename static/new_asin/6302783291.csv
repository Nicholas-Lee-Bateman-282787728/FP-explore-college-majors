7830980,5,6302783291,"Here are my reasons: 1. The delightful staging by Giorgio Strehler - a subtle and elegant setting for the precious jewel of Mozart's opera! Every little detail matters: dry leaves flutter with fear and fury when Don Giovanni escapes from Donna Anna's house; ""fleur d'orange"" removed from Zerlina's  head by amorous Don Giovanni and flowers thrown down by Masetto silently witness the passionate conversation between Don Giovanni, Don Ottavio, Donna Anna and Donna Elvira till finally are picked up by Leporello and Don Giovanni to remind them of the unhappy wedding celebration; Don Giovanni turns his would-be handshake with Leporello into a vulgar bribe to let the servant know his place... The ""catalogue scene"" (Leporello, Donna Elvira), the opening scene of the 2nd Act (Don Giovanni, Leporello), the ""dinner scene"" at the end of the 2nd Act (Don Giovanni, Leporello, Donna Elvira) are simply masterpieces! ...and not the only ones in this opera! 1. Acting/Performance
Certainly in an opera it is the quality of the music and singers' voices that matters. But the opera should not only be sung but performed! I mean the singers' performance starting with the intonation to the gestures and movement. Well, in this production you have the advantage of seeing all possible operatic performance styles... ;-) ""*"" - The singer goes to the middle of the stage and delivers his aria, his only concern being to start and stop singing with the music (F. Araiza as Don Ottavio). The singer feels the character's emotions. Her severe sufferings make the spectators suffer too till they start longing for someone to stop the poor singer's torments! (E. Gruberova as Donna Anna) I'm sorry to write this because they both have beautiful voices but poor performance ruins the effect! Try closing your eyes when they start singing! ;-} ""**"" - N. de Carolis as Masetto and S. Koptchak as the Commendatore - adequate performance. ""***"" - A. Murray as Donna Elvira - there are some obvious faults in her acting, but despite of it her performance seemed very sincere to me. S. Mentzer as Zerlina - charming!!! ""*****"" - T. Allen as Don Giovanni and C. Desderi as Leporello - there's actually so much to say about them that I think I shouldn't say anything... :) Gorgeous!! Every intonation, every turn of the head and every step shows their characters' personality and emotions. They are not Mr. Allen and Mr. Desderi singing arias: It is Don Giovanni, a Spanish nobleman, and Leporello, his servant, flirting with women, fooling about, plotting intrigues, enjoying life's pleasures and fearing the deadly handshake of the Commendatore...  An exciting portrayal of the love-hate relationship between the master and the servant and on the whole - a brilliant performance rarely to be seen in an opera! 3. Last but not least: the excellent ""screen version"" of the opera. I've seen several recorded operas and dramatic performances - most of them were impossibly tedious (being at the same time tremendous success at the theater). It seems that some very essential part of the theatre magic is lost when the opera/play/ballet is transferred to the video tape or DVD. Not in this case! C. Battistoni and his team did a creative and very professional job - the magic of Mozart's music (marvelously conducted by R. Muti) shines in all its glory!
Heavenly music + wonderful voices + beautiful staging + great performance = well deserved 5 stars!!!",998438400,15,3426,4.998248686514886
7830981,5,6302783291,"This has got to be the best version of Don Giovanni that I have ever seen. I have never been more moved by an opera in my entire life. I also wrote a review on another version of this opera, but I'd have to say that this one  is so much better. If you ever get any version of  Don Giovanni be sure to  get this one. It truly is worth the money to see Riccardo Muti conduct a  beautiful opera withThomas Allen as Don Giovani. Trust me, it is wonderful,  & breathtaking!",963273600,4,468,3.989247311827957
