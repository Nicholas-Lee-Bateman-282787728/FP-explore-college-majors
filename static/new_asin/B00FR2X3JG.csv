6022480,5,B00FR2X3JG,"I wrote this for the Amazon Instant Version of Nura: Rise of the Yokai Clan - Demon Capital Set 1 (eagerly awaiting set 2 and whatever else is to come) but it's equally as valid since their the same material I just can't comment on any of the DVD extras if there are any - Im surprised this (seems to be, from the picture on amazon of the physical copy) a DVD only release - when its beautiful in HD (via amazon instant) - I could be wrong though I just see two silver discs and figured (versus 4 with clear disctinctions between the blu rays and dvds)

Anyway - My Review:

Now this could be because they decided to divide up Nura 1-2 and Demon Capital (makes sense but if someone gets set 1 of demon capital - they'll be confused as hell as to whats going on, there's really no indication that this is technically a new arc - season 3). Also it seamlessly blends and innovates at the same time - many of my favorite aspects of a lot of different styles of anime. It doesn't get too divisive in its orders - like say one piece which is in my top 3 I'd say, but there are many different enemies and arcs etc - the characters are lovable - the action is great, the story is fast paced, yet there are twists and good developments. The characters aren't as rigidly archetypal or static - they grow as the series evolves. I was waiting for this since I finished Nura-Rise of the Yokai Clan Season 2 on Amazon Instant.

My question is - Where (or why isn't) is Demon Capital Set 2 on Amazon Instant yet?! and will it be posted any time soon?

I'll get the blu-ray/dvd if I need to - but I already own the rest of the series via digital so it only makes sense for organization purposes. I would appreciate it, if it is out - that someone put it up on for the users who love the Amazon Instant service. Much obliged.

I'm under the impression it's already out, Viz finished streaming them in 2011 lol - (I think that's how it works, stream subs, stream dubs, dub release either special edition or blu-ray/dvd combo, or separate - and a few years down the line either a box set if it continues or a cheaper version for those who with lighter wallets). It gives the viewers what they way, in a fast not draw out way - and its deep into oriental mysticism and demonology (yokai - ayakashi and the Onmyouji - whom of the shinto sect, shinto has always fascinated me as has all occidental and oriental mysticism/magick/philosophy) and have a lot of rural/ancient japanese architecture and sociology involved in it (the different views of the different clans, dependent on if they were yakuza/samurai, ayakashi, yokai or practioners of Onmyd - the Onmyouji). Plus the visuals are great, especially in HD. So if your looking for another copy-cat series, this isn't for you. If your looking for something that gives you the best of what the collective consciousness of anime viewers want, and gives it a new sprits of imagination, creativity and innovation - then I highly recommend this series. If you like Shonen at all - you'll like this series, especially if you like seeing it taken in new places.

I think it could last a long time, if the viewers/readers/ratings/sales go up steadily (although I do think it could've used more Advertisement, and could've fit perfectly into an anime block on some cable or satelite station being short 13-26 series arc - depending on how you wanna divide it arc - season or set)

It is a part of the Shonen-Jump family after all, Ive yet to be dissapointed by Shonen Jump (although Im still eagerly awaiting the new Dragon Ball Z Movie! Shame the USA seems to get everything last... or 2-5 or longer years after its original run)

I really hope it does continue and gets the love that bleach, one piece, dragon ball z, hunterxhunter, etc -nget (I like almost all anime, Im just listing the top Shonen series, minus Seinen) and the companies involved wish to continue making the series. Theres so many directions the story could go in, given the way their telling them (in arcs - with, insofar as I can tell - no over-arching end-all-be-all like Bleach for say). I also love the paranormal investigation club aspect, and all the things the main character has to learn along the way, from his techniques - what it means to be a Nurarihyon - struggling with *spoiler alert somewhat* 1/4 yokai - 3/4 human side, which starts as a burden but really - ends up being his biggest strength - in himself and as a leader of the Nura Clan. Theres so many places the story could go after Demon Capital.

I'm eager to see whats next! Id imagine there are alot more clans and types of enemies (the series Id say this most reminds me of, not plot wise - but the way the characters are so unique in their power sets - is Basilisk, another fantastic series) to be clashed with/make friends with. Backstory that could be filled it, hell - I would LOVE (after the proper amount of sequels has been established) to see a prequel series - dealing with his father and grandfather at their height (his father looked like he kicked some serious ass - and could go into the 13 seals by the Onmyouji head at that time).

As I'm writing this as I'm in the middle of Psycho-Pass and Robotics;Notes (both sets) - so that just goes to show how much I love this series. I miss fun hearted, but at the same time seriously epic battles, that can sometimes get dark, with a wide array of interesting foes and heroes - but also doesn't leave you with a malaise but has just enough comedic relief, tension/darkness and very little (just to please the few) Fan Service (ala Dragon Ball Z, HunterxHunter, Trigun). As can happen with some of these dystopian futuristic 'phillip k dickian' animes/mangas - which are by far some of my favorites, psycho-pass is amazing going to start set 2 after Nura Demon Capital - Serial Experiments Lain is one of the biggest influences on my music, and easily one of the greatest animes of all time - but the most malaise or emotional impact (in a sad/depressed sort of way) i've felt from a series (not a movie) is Texhnolyze (which I still haven't finished despite loving the atmosphere and story - and plan to finish - I just couldn't at that point in time) or perhaps in a more existential way I'd say Casshern Sins.

Side Note: Not to do with Nura; Rise of The Yokai Clan (Demon Capital Set 1): I applaud the makers of Psycho-Pass for giving the just dues to Phillip K Dick - he is a Visionary/Prophet of Science Fiction (there's even a history channel series, with an episode ""Prophets of Science Fiction - Phillip K Dick"" on amazon Instant if you wanna see the proof, he was writing about virtual reality, cybernetics/trans-humanism, meta-topics, non-linear/multiplicity/quantum physics/mechanics/psychology, androids, cyborgs, robots, among too many other futuristic things to even list here among things that we STILL don't have or have an inkling of how to go about making them - back when phones were rotary and corded, and 8-tracks/vinyls - we're the physical medium for entertainment and written medium we're typed on type writers) next to HG Wells (War of The Worlds Radio Broadcast) he is arguable THE MOST important writer in science fiction history, if you've seen minority report, investigation bureau, blade runner, total recall (original with Arnold Schwarzenegger or the new one with Colin (whats-his-last-name-there Firth?) - his material has been used in Cyber Punk and across the science fiction genre worldwide, without getting his just dues, ala The Matrix) or A Scanner Darkly - those are ALL based on Phillip K Dick novels/novellas - and there's plenty more to come) There are many animes that unconsciously or subconsciously (either direct inspiration from his works or from them seeing something that was inspired by, that was inspired by, etc etc P.K.D.)",1395619200,2,7806,4.592539454806313
6022481,5,B00FR2X3JG,I have and watched first season of this anime and it was great.  I just received this second season and I can't wait to start watching this second season episodes.,1391472000,2,163,4.433333333333334
6022482,1,B00FR2X3JG,"Ughh... yeah that about sums it up. To clarify, this one star rating isn't intended for the show itself which would probably be some where around 3 or so. Not exactly a typical shounen anime, but a shounen anime none the less. At the time of this review this 13 episode set is $50. Lol what? Geez viz I know you obviously have to make a profit because you are a business after all but come on. For $50 I could buy an out of print bandai title. I could buy a few FUNimation shows Or maybe some manga. Or maybe some manga and FUMimation shows. In the end, it all comes down to the almighty dollar. Viz loves to invest in any cash cow they can squeeze money out of such as bleach or naruto. This $50 13 episode set is no different. As long as people keep buying viz products like this at ridiculous prices things will never change.",1383782400,5,828,4.149068322981367

6022525,5,B00FR2X3JG,"I absolutely LOVE this series! It is a must watch for anyone who enjoys action, adventure, comedy, AND Japanese folklore. It's an amazing, well written manga and anime series that you don't reallu happen to come by that much anymore. It also deserves more recognition and most importantly a season 3! If only the creators would do just that to wrap up unfinished business for those who have only seen the show but still appreciate it. I highly recommend this to those who look for a show with great character development and a story with great depth. 5 out of 5!",1424736000,,562,4.574257425742574
