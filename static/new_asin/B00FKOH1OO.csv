8616392,1,B00FKOH1OO,I wasn't able to play it on any of my DVD and Blu-ray players:( it said it's not compatibale .,1529712000,,94,3.75
8616393,5,B00FKOH1OO,"Exceptionally well acted, written and filmed. The blu ray is full HD quality video and 5.1 Dolby Surround audio. There is a nice booklet inside with pictures from the film. The text is in German. I don't read German but Google translate was fine for navigating the on screen menu and selecting English subtitles. It's easy enough to understand ""Sarten Film"" without translating. This disc does have a/b printed on it and it does play on both my Toshiba and Samsung blu ray players but it would not play on my Sony blu ray player or Playstation 3. Note: if you don't like the green age label on the front cover just flip the cover to the other side which doesn't have it stamped there.",1522713600,,684,4.48
