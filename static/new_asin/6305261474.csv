7888449,4,6305261474,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others. In this volume we are given background on Tenchi, and the girls. The back story is completely different. So this series isn't a continuation of the others. It's an all new story by itself. There are 3 episodes on this DVD. The first 2 are kind of unimportant, mostly. Sasami meets the new enemy without realizing it. She becomes friends with her. The 3rd episode, #7, is the back story. It's kind of weak compared to what we are used to, and definitely has some major holes in it. It works though I guess. I think the main focus of this series is the new girlfriend that Tenchi falls in love with, and the severed bonds with the other girls.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe. It is good though, and I think most Tenchi fans will like it.",1353024000,,1444,4.428571428571429
7888450,5,6305261474,"Endearing characters all--the heroes and villains in this series provide a fantastic and sometimes nonsensical escape, mixed with familiar life lessons in an atmosphere of comic humor, love, understanding, and forgiveness.  Tenchi and the gang are a nice break from the pointless hostility and desperate patterns of the ""real"" world.",1224806400,,333,5.66
7888451,4,6305261474,"While Tenchi enjoys his new life in the big city, the girls back home are having problems with money.  They don't HAVE any.  So Ayeka, Mihoshi, Kiyone and Ryoko head for Tokyo in order to make their fortune.  Of course, nothing is what is seems.  When the girls, after many failures, find the perfect job it turns out they're working for one of Yugi's minions.  Later on, after Sasami flees to Tokyo from the household, where the girls were trying to steal her money, she and Tenchi have a play date which ends up with Sasami running into another minion of Yugi (who gets beat up by Ryo-Ohki of all people).
The last episode is a flash-back of how all the girls met Tenchi.  Turns out Washu and Ryoko were space pirates (gee, you guess?), Kiyone and Mihoshi are police who were chasing them, and Ayeka and Sasami are Jurai Princesses.  It seems Washu and Ryoko took the Jurai Lightstone.  Ayeka felt the police might not be able to return the Lightstone, so she (and her sister) also joined in the chase.  Everybody ended up on Earth.
I had to take away a point because, frankly, the DVD is not very interesting.  And the artwork is not as good as in the OVAs or the first TV series.",1087603200,,1183,4.385321100917431
7888452,3,6305261474,"The Tenchi in Tokyo series is no where near as good as the OAV or Universe series. The animation isn't as good, and Tenchi is a complete jerk to the girls. He betrays them and this series is nowhere near as funny as the others. The addition of Sakuya is interesting, but not enough to make up for Tenchi's rudeness to the girls. Washu dosen't get a big enough part, either. I am glad that Kiyone is in this series, but she seems meaner to Mihoshi than she was in the Universe series. In short, the Tenchi in Tokyo series is a complete letdown when you have seen the other two series.",1072569600,,583,4.214285714285714
7888453,5,6305261474,"Tenchi put his rural life away finally to go to Tokyo giving to the Tenchi we know a whole new route. This anime is great,the plot has a very good point even when the animation isn't that great as we use to see in Tenchi Muyo and Tenchi Universe but Tenchi is Tenchi,and you just have to accept what Tenchi brings us. Is Tenchi's encarnation doesn't follow the plot of Tenchi Universe at all but it is still good and very enjoyable too. I love the way they introduced us to a new generation of Tenchi. New characters were add to the Tenchi's Saga,new romances,new villains,but our Tenchi would be always our Tenchi wherever he goes and there would be his girls always by his side,I think that's what Make Tenchi one of the best anime ever made!!!",984096000,,746,4.413043478260869
7888454,4,6305261474,"I loved the OVA series, Mihoshi Special, the movies and the 1st TV series and now this is what I call CORE!!!!!  Now you must remeber that each series gives a different way Tenchi meets the ladies of his unbalanced  life(I love the OVA version more because each episode intro them separately  except Kiyone's intro in the Mihoshi Special).  This series does lets  Tenchi grow alittle more and adding Sakuya to the cast really makes things  more interesting.  All the old elements are there(Ayeka and Ryoko fighting  for Tenchi's love) so no Tenchi fan will lose interest.  The real plus is a  different villian and goal to the series that is a departure from the OVA  and 1st TV series. I can't wait to see what happen next!!!",929836800,2,726,4.59375
