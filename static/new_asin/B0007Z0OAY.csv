(Unlike _Black Cobra_, whose two sequels are included in the 50-pack too, _Ninja Death_ is all one big story arc. Part 1 isn't a complete story without parts 2 and 3.)

Save your money and get more movies at the same time. Buy the aforementioned 50-pack and then get the Martial Arts 20-Movie Pack, which overlaps the 50-pack by only a couple of movies.",1240444800,2,588,4.88
