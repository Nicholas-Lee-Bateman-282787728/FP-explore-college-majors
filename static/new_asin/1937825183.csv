8324351,5,1937825183,Outstanding DVD expertly produced by Marine Lt Bryan Lash.  This is truly a Marine's Perspective account of the Vietnam war.  I served with Bryan in Vietnam and appreciate all the hard work to produce this DVD.  Several other Marine Officers tell their story to set the record straight.  The DVD explains how the Media inaccurately told their story.  I highly recommend this DVD to all who served as well as to those who did not.  This DVD chronicles the bravery and sacrifice of our Marines in Vietnam.  Semper Fi Bryan!,1443916800,,521,4.722222222222222
8324352,5,1937825183,"As a Marine Vietnam veteran who served during the same time these guys did, 67-68, it is refreshing to hear the things I have been thinking for years.  We did win the battles.  Americans did serve honorably and with courage.  The media and Hollywood have it all wrong.  This video should be in every high school and college in America.  Listening to the comments of these decorated combat officers is inspiring and very emotional for me.  Hats off.  Semper fi.",1037923200,5,460,4.675
