796662,5,630417067X,"An objective film about a forgotten civil war. Loach is very sincere and makes as thinking that tyrans and fascists were in both parts of the front, that winning a battle or ""entering the Winter Palace"" is not the  end but the beginning of  a long march, which ends in a new tyranny, often  worse than the previous one.

The pivotal scene where a group of international soldiers of a ""POUM"" (a people's collective  militia) express their opinions to a village meeting is brilliantly done.  Sixty-five years later, historians still have difficulty explaining and  understanding this critical conflict.

This film is also very close to  George Orwell's vision of Stalin's betrayal of revolution, which set the  grounds for Animal Farm and 1984.

796893,5,630417067X,"I can't add anything new or different to the reviews posted here.  This is one of my favorite films, and I really admire Ken Loach's attempt to make a film about one young man and how he fared in a war far from home.  The actual story of the Spanish Civil War is too broad, too complicated, and still not understood well enough to fit inside a single film.  Instead, Loach centers the film around the experiences of a decent, somewhat naive, working class man from Liverpool who chooses to involve himself in probably the most bloody, complicated event of his era.

I loved the movie when it came out and had it on VCR for many years.  I was glad to see it finally released in DVD format.  When I got the film yesterday, I was initially concerned to see that the cover material was in Korean.  The film itself is in English and some Spanish, just as I remembered.

796894,4,630417067X,"As Americans we have been fed a rather romantic line about the Spanish Civil War: the freedom loving country people resisting the evil Franco and his Fascist / Nazi thugs.

If you are a little more discerning you find that this was not the case:  The freedom fighters were soon betrayed by the Soviets (who had an agenda other than freedom) and eliminated.  The Left killed 35,000 priests and religious workers. It turned out to be Stalin and Hitler using Spain as a surrogate field of battle.

We are all sinful men, and civil wars bring out the very worst in us as brother kills brothers.  This is a poignant account of idealism being confronted by reality.  Well acted and poignant.  A small window into life.",1310083200,3,712,4.603174603174603

One of the few movies made about the Spanish Civil War, Land and Freedom functions both as an engaging war movie and (most particularly in a brilliant scene depicting a town meeting) as an examination of the reasons why the left lost the war; it's a bit hard to find but you'll be rewarded for seeking it out.",1233187200,,327,4.360655737704918
796902,3,630417067X,"Ken Loach's LAND AND FREEDOM won two awards at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and was also considered as the best European Film of 1995. I do have a tremendous respect for the works of Ken Loach, such directors who handle social, political or historical matters in their films, are necessary. In LAND AND FREEDOM, Ken Loach's intentions were to remind us that the dissensions between the different left-wing Spanish movements were the principal cause of General Franco's victory in 1939 and the fascist dictatorship that ruled Spain until 1975.

As I didn't particularly study this tragic period of the history of Spain, I watched LAND AND FREEDOM without any preconceived ideas. The first part of the film is rather boring with interminable debates about collectivism, communism or stalinism. But as soon as the members of the militia understand that their leaders are willing to sacrifice them in the name of political realism, the movie starts to become very interesting because it poses a fundamental question: what for does each member of the militia fight ? Out of idealism, pity for the Spanish people or against Fascism ?

797020,5,630417067X,"Similar in format to Orwells homage to Catalonia the films story surrounds a young Liverpudlian (not someone from Lancashire God knows why someone below wrote that either they didn't bother reading the rear of the DVD or they still think Liverpool is in Lancashire) who goes over to fight on the side of the republicans and ends up fighting with one of the many militas (in this case the POUM)

The film stars with a young woman in a council flat in Liverpool calling an ambulance for her sick grandfather, its only on his being taken to hospital she begins to look through his personal belongings to find a part of his history that she previously didn't know.

The lack of proper training, the poor arms that they carry, the lack of discipline (one of the soldiers refusing to march) and the endless pointless political infighting (see the scene where they debate over the collectivisation of that land they have captured) are all displayed.  One of the most touching scenes is when the battle lines are drawn up between the main communist party and the POUM and Anarchist parties Hart finds himself on the communist lines with Anarchists in the opposite building.

As both sides trade insults he hears an English voice.  He cries out ""Where are you from?"" ""Manchester"" comes the reply ""Where are you from?"" ""Liverpool"" Answers Hart. ""What are you doing over there?"" Asks Hart.  ""What are you doing over there?"" Replies the unknown militia man. At which point gunfire is exchanged and Hart cries out ""Enough!""

This is not just a propaganda film for the left, the mistakes of the left in Spain are clear enough in the film. Yes, they were fighting with one hand tied behind their backs but after spending much of their time fighting each other was it any wonder the right succeeded in Spain?

This is a touching film, not simply a political one.  Most of all its the story of one man who with the convition of his beliefs went to fight for what he believed in.",1177804800,,1961,4.628242074927954
797021,2,630417067X,"The protagonist in this film is a Lancashire Communist who somehow winds up in a POUM unit. This didn't happen. Communists from England were under discipline to join the International Brigades. The Hart character is supposed to be some sort of working class Orwell. But Orwell was a Trotskyite (not a member of the CPUK) who wrote of brutal slaughter of the Trotskyites (POUM) by the International commissars in ""Homage to Catalonia.""

The killing of Catholics by the so-called Republicans was widespread and huge. In the hundreds of thousands. For a good work of fiction dealing with the Spanish Civil War, check out the trilogy by Jose Maria Gironella starting with ""The Cypresses Believe in God."" The Republicans lost because the majority of the Spanish people opposed the destruction of their religion, culture, and rights by foreign commissars hostile to the traditions of Spain.

The Reds called all their opponents ""fascists.""  But the Nationalists were composed of Christian Democrats, monarchists, a broad spectrum to the right of the Communists, Anarchists, and Socialists on the Republican side. At the onset of the war, the Falange represented one of the smallest parties in the Nationalist coalition.

In 1939, Spain was economically far behind Poland. Having visited both countries over the years from 1970 on, I can say that if you have to pick being ruled by the Communists or the Falangists, pick the Falangists.

Hart is a good actor and this is not a bad film. But its message is based on a romanticization of the ""Republican"" side which is far removed from reality. You really need to marvel over that village debate on collectivization of farms. The Spanish people profited greatly from the Republican defeat.  As the humorist Tom Lehrer once sang, ""Remember the war against Franco. That's the one where every one of us belongs. Though they may have won all the battles, we had all the good songs.""

797022,5,630417067X,"To speak of the Spanish Civil War is extremely difficult today. To speak of it from an English point of view is even more impossible. Yet Ken Loach manages to keep his tone and our interest totally measured and awake from beginning to end. Never he lets us go down into forgetting that we are speaking of one essential defeat of the revolutionary movement in the world in the late 1930s when confronted to the frontal violence from Hitler and Mussolini. And he does remind us of the fact that the Soviet Union never helped the Republicans and that Stalin both refused to hear the call and manipulated the communist party in Spain into dividing the republican movement in  order to try and take the control of it all. The point is to wonder whether Stalin and the communist party of Spain knew that it would mean defeat for the republicans, and hence did they want that defeat ? The accusation, even in the form of a question, is crystal clear. Stalin's motivation on the other hand is extremely unclear and Ken Loach prefers not to enter any speculation on the subject. The conclusion is there to be heard and understood and it was a catastrophe in Spain, in Europe and in the world, a catastrophe that never had had and never has had any equivalent in history. But is Stalin the only culprit ? No one can say for sure, and quite a few elements point in a more all-inclusive explanation without entering details : Stalin refused weapons and support, the west refused weapons and support, Hitler and Mussolinin sent their bombers and ammunitions, be it only to test them on a real battlefield. The great merit of Ken Loach's film is that seventy years (sixty years whe  the film was shot) or so after the events, the wound is still open, the question has not yet been answered and the dramatic consequences are still there to be assessed and regretted. Our modern world of liberal frenzy is the direct child of what happened in France and Spain, Germany and Italy, England and the Soviet Union seventy years ago. And we are still on the same line of division and antagonism, of change without risk and non-change to avoid any risk, in a world that is gaping and howling for change while hoping this unstoppable change will not put the whole fragile balance of reality in danger. And there is no guarantee against this risk. That's what to be poor is all about today : to be haunted by fear in front of the risk the change we desire may mean.

797023,5,630417067X,"I had heard about this film by director Ken Loach a few years before getting to see it, and I can't emphasize how impressive the film is - it not only has realistic war drama, but examines and expresses the complexities of one of the greatest problems in the 20th century - the struggle of working class people for some kind of system other than capitalism that was not tainted with the authoritarianism and anti-humanism of Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin's USSR or Mao's mainland China.

Regardless of the downplaying by right-wing ""business as usual"" extremists like Angel Garralda Ortega (who wrote a review that attacked this movie below), there really was (and still is) a libertarian communist movement - made up of anarchists - that was based on the idea of worker's shrugging bosses and landlords off their back - not forcibly banning exploitation with the use of the state and it's laws, but rather the libertarian idea of not letting oneself be exploited, and not exploiting others - abandoning the essence of capitalism in an anti-authoritarian manner.

Also, Mr. Ortega has it wrong - the sporadic killings from the Republican side at the opening of the Spanish Civil War only amounted to some 3 or 4 thousand deaths of Fascist supporting landlords and Spanish catholic church officials who had orders to kill the libertarians and republicans on sight. The anarchist CNT organization opposed such vigilantism and punished those individuals that did it. Contrast this with the hundreds of thousands to millions of tortured and executed republicans, libertarians, liberals, workers, small businessmen, progressive Catholics, protestants, and so on who opposed Franco after the civil war's end in 1939. Also, the POUM was not trotskyist. It was an independent socialist organization that had broken from Trotsky, and it's leading figure, Andrs Nin, was executed by Stalinists - like so many militia fighters such as anarchist Camillo Berneri.

In another Amazon review, Jonas Liljestrm of Gothenburg, Sweden has explained the basic point I am making better than I could:

""Historians who attempt to rehabilitate Franco's reputation often tend to overlook the fact that whereas the Republicans generally tried to avoid unnecessary acts of brutality during the war, the Nationalists did exactly the opposite. Mass killings, rapes, looting and wanton destruction were commonplace as they terrorised the civilians in the newly conquered areas, trying to discourage them from putting up a resistance. The repression of political opponents continued virtually throughout the duration of the Franco regime.

The fact that Franco fought communism is no reason to glorify him. After all, Hitler did the same, but the homicidal aspects of his politics are so blatantly obvious that it would be quite impossible to depict him as anything resembling a heroic figure. In my opinion, defending Franco is as outrageous from an ethical point of view as it would be to defend Hitler, Mussolini or Stalin.""

But I digress... this film accurately shows how there was a popular libertarian socialist revolution in Madrid and Barcelona in Spain in 1936 that was crushed by Stalinists a year later, leading to the inevitable disheartenment and loss of the civil war by those who wanted to preserve liberty and democracy.

The actors in this film are likely to be unfamiliar to US viewers, but I know that the lead, Ian Hart, was later in the first Harry Potter film.

Be sure to also see the magnificent Spanish Civil War film ""Libertarias"" directed by Vicente Aranda. It's focus is more squarely on the anarchist CNT, instead of the independent Marxist POUM.

Artificial Eye is releasing a region 2 DVD of this film, available from the UK version of Amazon.

797024,3,630417067X,"The acting in the film is exceptional, especially the female protagonist.  The problem with the film is that it doesn't adequately develop its two principal concerns: the Stalinist/Marxist betrayal of the Spanish Civil War and the developing romantic relationship between the protagonists.  Lesser concerns are left undeveloped as well, such as David Hart's life after his return from the revolution.  All we know is that his granddaughter reads Hart's old letters and newspaper clippings after his death.  The lifetime effect of the revolution on Hart is anyone's guess.  The film's virtue is its historical accuracy.

797025,5,630417067X,"I rate this movie as one of the best regarding the Spanish Civil war. I really think it is very documented and shows a corner of that tragedy that needs more exposure.

  The only small critizism to the writer of Land and Freedom is that it follows too close the steps of George Orwell in its masterfull Homage to Catalunya and the adventures of the hero of Land and Freedom are too similar to the autobiographic adventures of Orwell,  also it oversimplifies the idealism of the social reforms that the anarkists and trotzkists were performing in the valleys of Aragon  and the Ebro, disregarding the violence that sometimes fell upon their opositionists or presumed landlords. It was a revolution and as such it had its share of idealists , martirs and also criminals and violentists.
  But anyhow the movie is a masterpiece.",1032566400,5,826,4.774647887323944

It is often levelled that the film is somewhat factually inaccurate. Don't let this put you off. The film is instructive in the mood and landscape of Spain; and the innocence and bravery of the Spanish anarchists and the international brigade. The story line infact mirrors amazingly closely George Orwell's semi- auto biographical account 'Homage to Catalunia'!!! This (as far as I'm aware) never gets said!

797027,2,630417067X,"I do not know if being born in Spain gives me any moral authority to talk about our Civil War. I may be as biassed as anybody else in my country but at least I am well informed about this tragic event because my parents and close relatives on both sides of the ideological spectrum suffered it.
If you are trying to learn something about the Spanish Civil War, this film will only offer a one-sided view of this dramatic event:That of the POUM mitilia.
If you are looking for an idealistic war film of goodies and badies in the old hollywood style it may be fine, but without special effects in this case!
The thing I like most in this film is the actual fight, which resembles the way the Spanish Civil War was actually fought. No gimmicks, just old fashioned guns and plenty of guts and walking. The thing that disappointed me most was the old crap of Communist militias being portrayed as saviors of the people after the whole world has witnessed Communist achievements eventually! The POUM was no exception in the Spanish Civil War. They mercilessly killed every enemy they bumped into, like the rest of the contenders.
In the film nobody is murdered by these ""Trotskyite saints"" except an ""evil priest"" who had taken an unusually active role in the battle. Everyone knons that around 7,000 priests and nuns where butchered in the Spanish Civil War by Communist and Socialist militias. They were considered enemies of the people for just being priests and nuns (maybe also sympathisers of the right wing political parties).
Just a few more words to the previous reviewers. Sorry to spoil the dream, but the Spanish Civil War was just more than a confrontation between Fascism and Democracy. Although the Civil War started in 1936, the political confrontation started in 1931 or even before. There were democrats on both sides of the front. Eventually radicals took control of the situation on both sides, as it always happens when there is a war.
I am no Franco supporter, but if you ask me to choose a winner I would say I am moderately happy with the outcome. Just look at Spain after Franco's death. Democracy could be installed quickly because Spain was economically and politically mature. Now look at the old Communist block and see yourselves. What would have happened if the Republic had won the war. Make no mistake. Spain would have been under Stalin's boot! The film is accurate in this respect. The POUM mitilia was destroyed by the Communist party because Stalin ordered it. He would have been the boss in Spain if Franco had not won the War.
For a more balanced view on the Civil War I recommend other Amazon pick. ""Spanish Civil War"" (a six hour documentary with original footage and interviews with people who lived the event. From both sides!).",999388800,16,2765,4.703092783505155
797028,5,630417067X,"In 1936 Franco and three other fascist generals, aided by Hitler and Mussolini, attempted a military coup against the democratically elected Spanish republican government. A broad political spectrum of anti-fascist groups opposed Franco. Opposition ranged from republicans, such as Ortega y Gassett, to anarchists, trades unionists, socialists, and communists. Because the army itself had revolted, people banded together to form militias to defend the freedom of their nation. The great Western ""Democracies"" refused to aid in this battlethey feared that power of the people. Starved for support, the republican forces received their only official aid from Mexico and the USSR. All over the world, however, idealists who believed in democracy and in the ability of people to work together for a better world, made their way to Spain to fight against International Fascism.
Land and Freedom follows the story of Dave Hart, a working-class British Communist, who leaves his girlfriend to help stop fascism. Hart does not get assigned to the International Brigade (a Stalinist Communist militia), and ends up in a militia of foreign volunteers, loosely affiliated with the POUM, a non-Stalinist Marxist group. They fight alongside anarchists and anybody else who will oppose Franco. The unit votes on matters, officers are accorded no special privileges-the traditional hierarchical structures are absent.
In this millieu, Dave writes home about the struggle, the frustration of being poorly armed, about comradery. We watch him falling in love with Blanca, one of the other soldiers. After he is wounded, he encounters the Stalinist brigades he had hoped to join. The movie begins to tell the story of how the democratic forces of the Spanish Republic were undermined and destroyed by the Stalinist elements. This point is driven home with a vengeance.
In many ways, this movie dramatizes George Orwell's experiences in the civil war, as told in his Homage to Catalonia. Both Dave and George volunteered to fight on the Republican side, both ended up in POUM militia units, both were wounded, and both were purged and endangered by the Stalinists who gained control by deciding who to arm and who to arrest. A story line that departed from Orwell and showed us more of the ""People's"" revolution, showed us workers running factories for themselves, showed us campesinos collectively farming, showed us schools that taught children with dignity and respect-such a movie would have paid more homage to the indefatigable spirit of the Spanish people and the innovative courage they showed in the face of overwhelming odds. Anarchists receive little mention in the movie, occasional footnotes at best. This is unfortunate, as some of the most interesting phenomena about the Spanish civil war center on the anarchist and syndicalist movements.
In one scene, anti-fascist forces from different parties engage in a firefight, alternately shooting at and insulting each other. This, as much as Hitler's Stukas and Mussolini's support for Franco, allowed the forces of democracy to be crushed under jackboots in Spain. Totalitarian forces have one answer, one ideology. They all march to the same drum. Free people have many ideas, many ideals, and value different solutions to problems. If people are ever to govern themselves in a way that maximizes individual liberties, this conundrum must be solved.
In Spain, the fascists won. The failure of the United States, England, and France to provide aid for the republican forces allowed Hitler and Mussolini to flex their muscles without challenge or reprisal. It does not seem unlikely that fascism may have been contained and WW II prevented had the ostensibly ""Democratic"" nations come to the aid of democracy in Spain.
Frequently movies have foreign nationals speaking English in a foreign accent. Land and Freedom did not do this. Individuals spoke their native tongues with native accents. When the language was not English, subtitles were added. (Although it might have been nice to have subtitles for some of the thick ""English"" accents!) I find this greatly preferable to speaking English with an accent-it allows the poeia of the foreign language to add emotional character to the film that would otherwise be missing.
Currently, the movie is not available in DVD. This is unfortunate. It's the story of a powerful cusp in Western history, and the telling grips us and demands that we consider our own ideals, our own grasp of freedom, our own willingness to sit quitely by, watching Survivor Outback while our own nation experienced the coup d'etat of December 2000.
Five stars for content. Four-and-a-half stars for accuracy. Five stars for telling a gripping story that left me with tears in my eyes as the credits rolled.

797029,5,630417067X,"For most progressive-minded folks, the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) was the first salvo in the global struggle that eventually crushed facism and nazism. Yet, there was a dark side to the ""good fight."" Stalin  cynically twisted and manipulated the ""Popular Front"" movement to  suit his personal megalomania. He used Soviet military/financial aid to the  Spanish Republic and the organizational might of the Comintern (Communist  International) as the means of securing power for his lackeys in the  Spanish Communist Party and, thereby, extend his sphere of influence. This  power play resulted in the brutal repression and murder of many dedicated  anti-facists on the Left who opposed Stalinism with equal  fervor.
""Land & Freedom"" beautifully tells the story of an  English communist worker, who like hundreds of other young men and women  from around the world, goes to Spain to fight for his principles. Yet, his  experiences there teaches him a bitter lesson in political reality: those  seeking absolute power, regardless of what they call themselves, are the  real enemies of freedom.
This film was clearly inspired by ""Homage  To Catalonia,"" George Orwell's chronicle of his  own experiences in  the Spanish Civil War. Like Orwell, the film's hero joins the militia of  the POUM(Spain's anti-Stalinist Marxist-Leninist party)and comes to witness  first-hand the betrayal of the anti-facist struggle by the Stalinist  forces.
All in all, this is a well-researched and well-written story  offered up with superb acting amd directing. It was especially poignant for  me as I had the privilege of knowing folks who served in the militias of  the CNT-FAI, the Spanish anarchist-syndicalist labor movement. This film  brought to mind their sacrifice and heroism in the face of overwhelming  odds.

The DVD arrived on time and the film quality is better than my VHS copy.
 One  of my favorite movies of the Spanish  Civil War and I have added
  it  to my DVD collections.  Charles",1384992000,,247,4.0
7863437,2,630417067X,"I missed the opportunity to see this movie in the 1990's, but I heard it was a ""masterpiece"".  I have seen movies on the Spanish Civil War or its aftermath (Libertarias, La fiel infantera -filmed in Spain in Franco's time, 1959-, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Pan's Labyrinth, Pa Negre, 13 Rosas, La lengua de las mariposas -a real and sad masterpiece!- and more), and I was dissapointed with this one.  It is heavily in favor of the Anarchist movement in Republican Spain and shows Communists and other parties as if they were worst than the Facists!  It does no justice to people who fought and died for Republican values, no matter if they were Anarchists, Communists, from the PSOE, priests or peasants, poets or nurses.  The Spanish Republic and the war for its defense was more than an Anarchist job.",1364860800,3,801,4.659574468085107
