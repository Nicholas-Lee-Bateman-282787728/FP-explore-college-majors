7741412,5,B01EYJSJ6E,Mark has done a tremendous job of thoroughly investigating this group and then reporting on his findings in an objective manner.  His focus is on the well being of students and how they are impacted by concerns he highlights in this excellent documentary.  I appreciate him taking the time to share these findings through his film.,1465257600,3,331,4.892857142857143
7741413,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"ABSOLUTE TRUTH! This film is almost an exact account of what I went through at the Gulen school I taught at. The discrimination and illegal happenings were jaw dropping. This film has it right! This movement is insidious and everyone-not just parents and educators...but everyone needs to be aware of what is going on. Thank you, to the film's director for trying to bring such needed awareness about this organization. I hope people sit up and take notice!",1465257600,9,457,4.871794871794871
7741414,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"This documentary lays out all the facts about Charter School abuse of money and fraud.  Unfortunately its a national issue using one of the worse case scenarios a group called the Gulen Movement who has tax payer supported schools in 25 states, stealing Billions in bonds, grants and other educational related funds.  The Gulenists are not educators, Turkey has the worse education in the world, their schools are all hype and glossy marketing with fancy Science Olympiads with shiny trophies to give to smiling unsuspecting families.  The same families who allow their kids to dress in Turkish costumes, dance and sing Turkish under the flag of Turkey have no clue that this group is who is overthrowing the government of Turkey more than likely with money from US Tax payers the same money used to bribe US government officials.  The Gulen Movement is out of power in Turkey, and many other countries have closed their schools.  Lets hope and pray that sooner rather than later the USA wises up and steps up their federal investigations on these lying criminals before they rob us blind. Great Film and a real eye opener about our lack of charter school laws and accountability.",1465257600,8,1180,4.88
7741415,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"An accurate account of the shady business of charter schools in this country, particularly Gulen charter schools. These schools have a long history of corruption, cronyism and illegal activities. It is very eye opening. Prior to this I had seen the 60 minutes report but this is much more in depth. It is unbelievable how public taxpayer money is being used to rob our public schools. A must watch!!",1465257600,8,399,4.797101449275362

7741417,5,B01EYJSJ6E,This is a well-done documentary which teaches people about the dangers of allowing non-citizens to own and run schools in this country.  I hope that everyone in America would watch this film and wake up!,1464912000,8,203,4.8
7741418,1,B01EYJSJ6E,"This ""documentary"" is totally bogus. I have been a teacher at one of the schools featured in the movie for 4 years. There is absolutely no promotion of any religion. It's run like any other public school, just academically superior. These schools take kids from the same social classes and circumstances as those served by other public schools and routinely and regularly achieve superior outcomes. To insinuate that because they were founded by a Turkish American that they are somehow inserting Islam into the instruction is the worst form of bigotry. I am an evangelical pastor, with a Master's degree in Theology, a Biblical conservative and a very involved teacher. There is simply no truth to the insinuation. That's only one of many things this so-called ""documentary"" got wrong. It's wonderful fodder for misinformed and uninformed conspiracy theorists, but has no bearing in reality.

I have only seen the trailer and read the promotional materials and can clearly tell this is a hatchet job and not journalism.",1464220800,4,1020,5.107784431137724
7741419,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"If you are a parent, student, teacher, or an American you must watch this, you need to become aware of of the schools and the movement. This is eye opening and extremely concerning. I was a teacher at one of the schools and it is all very true and very scary information. This is one Film you have to see.",1463529600,10,305,4.1

7741422,4,B01EYJSJ6E,"This book does a public service by exposing a big con by a foreign country.  Very detailed with plenty of supporting evidence for the conclusions. I do take issue with the assertion that all charter schools are a bad thing, the public school monopoly needs competition.",1468886400,,269,4.8478260869565215
7741423,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"A well done, sobering documentary about something everyone should know about! Which powerhouse is running charter schools with taxpayer money, and which politicians are being courted to make it all happen, without question? Candid answers are brought to light in this documentary.",1468454400,2,280,5.690476190476191

7741425,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"Killing Ed is an eye opener for any parent, educator or any American.  I was clueless that this is going on here in Texas. Open schools cheat the system and the students, were the US government is paying the bill, increase profits by hiring subpar Turkish teachers and importing everything from Turkey, then shelter that money and make it non-taxable, because it is actually a religion wanting to take over the USA and turn it into the Ottoman Empire.  OH MY GOD!

This is a real live horror movie. I am so glad that I watched this documentary.

Any business that cannot be transparent to its customers, should be a giant red flag. Any company that is hiding their agenda and purpose, needs to be expunged and run out of town.  Mark Hall takes us deep into this serious problem.  He opens our eyes to the unbelievable!

This movie nailed it. I hope that it nails a coffin into the Gulen Movement.  This is a cult with a leader, who has made billions constructing s***ty schools, bringing over cheaply paid Turkish teachers with zero qualifications to teach, instilling Turkish principles and ideas into students, who just want to get an education and are promised many great things.  It is SCAREY!  Very scarey!

Tell your friends and neighbors; start the conversation openly with anyone in a charter school.  straight out ask anyone who has kids in a charter program if the teachers or administrators are mostly Turkish. Corruption to the tune of $500,000 a year of taxpayer's money goes into these sham schools.

There are even Gulen believers on the inside of the testing centers, at the national level, to make sure that their  charter school's tests are above average.  CULT CULT CULT level religion and not what our future should be facing.

This ever growing chain of charter schools needs to be wiped out. Watch this movie and then tell others.  We are not hearing the truth from Dan Patrick or others....

I just called Dan Patrick's office and also wrote him an email.  Please do the same.  Get any press that you know to hear the story and watch the movie!  We need to get the word out!

Thank you Mark for this chilling movie.  Now go make more!",1466553600,2,2157,4.618421052631579
7741426,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"A good documentary.  Diane Ravitch introduces the idea of this documentary at the beginning with a concise voice over.  For those interested in what's happening in education, this is a must see.  5 stars!",1465689600,7,204,4.9411764705882355
7741427,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"This is a very well laid out documentary about the Gulan movement and their takeover of charter schools.  Talking about the details makes you sound like a conspiracy nut, but it's really a true and terribly frightening story.  Worth your time to watch and learn and hopefully know more before this happens to your schools!",1465430400,5,322,4.836363636363636
7741428,1,B01EYJSJ6E,"I have worked at Harmony for 7 years and I'm a charter school advocate.  Yes, I have watched the film.  I bought the movie on Amazon because I did not feel it was appropriate for me to make any comment if I did not know what was actually in this documentary.  This documentary is full of ridiculous falsehoods, not just about Harmony but my fellow charter colleagues.
I welcome anyone to visit our schools and see how we are positively impacting our students, families, and communities.  We have an open door policy and would love to host you.
This review is per the request of Killing Ed's Facebook page.  I have no other agenda.  Make your own decisions based on your own research.",1465344000,5,683,4.512195121951219
7741429,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"Interesting story.  These Gulen schools should be more transparent.  Why lying about your association with Gulen if you have nothing to hide?

Any generalized anti-muslim sentiment is unfair.  But, these school should be up front with their association to an Islamic group which furthering Islam and Ottoman glory is core.",1465344000,4,322,5.38
8759784,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"Killing Ed is credible, informative and alarming. I've purchased multiple copies to share. Like me, almost all are unaware of Fethullah Gulen, the Gulen Movement and the influence this Turkish Imam is having on our educational and political systems. First be informed, then share in your circle of influence.",1517788800,,308,5.3061224489795915
8759785,5,B01EYJSJ6E,"All charters are a major threat to our republic, but the Glen charters are the biggest threat. This is a national security issue our elected officials are ignoring. Charters do not have locally elected boards. The spread of charters undermines local public schools and drains resources both directly and indirectly. My favorite part of the documentary was when Mark Hall interviewed Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. Patrick defended the indefensible because he doesnt want anything standing in the way of the privatization of public education. Charters will be the new Big Short.",1509235200,2,568,5.252747252747253

8759790,1,B01EYJSJ6E,"If Mark S. Hall's previous documentary ""Sushi: The Global Catch"" is any indication of this man's methods, than it should be obvious to the viewer that Mark S. Hall takes a strictly one-sided approach regarding the way in which he presents his topic. I'm giving this documentary one star because Mr. Hall is merely presenting the issue as he wants you to see it. Most charter schools provide a valuable education withheld from public school children.

I appreciate Mr. Hall's attempt to shed light on the dubious business practices represented in his movie, but I would have appreciated it if he had presented the topic in a way in which would allow the casual viewer to witness the true value of charter schools. Unfortunately, Mark S. Hall's attitude toward charter schools are polarized mainly along ideological lines. I encourage everyone who watches this film to spend and hour or two conducting their own research into the business of charter schools. Watching documentaries is supposed to be educational, so do your homework.",1475193600,,1031,5.029239766081871
8759791,5,B01EYJSJ6E,Mark Hall has done an excellent job researching Charter Schools established under Fetullah Gulen's influence. It includes testimonials that verify the clear goal of the Islamic Gulen Movement that operates under the guise of Interfaith Dialogue. I wish everyone in America would view this documentary so they will understand that the cleric from Turkey has come to live in Philadelphia and has established these schools with an agenda in mind. Our tax-payer dollars are supporting the Gulen charter schools!,1475107200,2,507,5.430379746835443
