7538839,1,B0182W7JSS,I was waiting for an American blu-ray release of this spectacular 5 star miniseries...had even preordered it until I started looking into the fact that Shout out is actually advertising this as the complete film...but on their site they have admitted to having an edited version missing at least two very important scenes. I canceled my order and hoping they correct it! I have the DVD which is complete and guess that will have to do a bit longer.,1455408000,67,448,4.6835443037974684
7538840,5,B0182W7JSS,"This miniseries is the best version of Jesus' life that I've seen. So many great actors in this film with inspiring background music. Although it's true that this blu-ray is missing some scenes, it doesn't take away from the fact that it's an excellent film.",1455408000,4,258,4.7555555555555555
7538841,2,B0182W7JSS,"This film is a classic, and should have a complete frame by frame film restoration before a release on Blu-ray. The Shout Factory admits that this film is a DVD transfer with missing scenes. This is nothing but 'a money grab' by The Shout Factory.",1455408000,16,247,4.511111111111111
7538842,1,B0182W7JSS,I want to give Amazon cutouts for allowing these low ratings ot be posted so that potential purchasers can be better informed buyers. I personally watched every segment of the original series in the early eighties when NBC first aired this series. And I have the original series on DVD. It would be nice if some company decided to make this series available in BluRay in its entirety. Thanks again to Amazon for allow constructive criticism.,1454976000,6,441,4.815789473684211
7538843,1,B0182W7JSS,"My 1-Star rating as nothing to do with this Very Nice Franco Zeffirelli Film.  It has to do with the mismarketing of this excellent Film by Shout Factory!

This Version of ""Jesus Of Nazareth: The Complete Miniseries"" by Shout is not ""Complete"" as advertised.  It is missing at least Two Scenes.

The Shout Page Discussion has Shout Moderators clearly acknowledging that their Version is the Cut one:

[...]
And the discussion at blu-ray.com has the details of the Different Versions - The Australian and the Spanish being Complete.

[...]

And as an Important aside, Shout has not always been honest about their releases. They were quite duplicitous and lying about their Route 66 Box a few years back:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1697D4OCE0V8V/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077T5SWC#R1697D4OCE0V8V",1454803200,28,820,5.831932773109243
7538844,1,B0182W7JSS,"I had purchased the Artisan complete  unedited version on 2 dvds. The running time 382 mins. It does contain the 2 deleted scenes.  The quality of the film claims to be digitally mastered. I would like to buy the Shout blu ray but, can't  move myself to do it. The flow of the movie and the importance  of those 2 scenes  are critical. I enjoy this movie so much and it does need to be complete and unedited otherwise I would not purchase it. Therefore movie worth a 5 stars but 1 for claiming to be complete when it is not.",1454716800,22,524,4.148514851485149
7538845,1,B0182W7JSS,"This is a release of the first broadcast, which means many scenes are deleted. Contrary to what SHOUT Factory claims, this is not the complete version of ""Jesus of Nazareth"". They play with words as it is the version broadcasted first. But NBC had deleted many scene by fear the show might be too long. After the great reception by the critics and viewers, scenes that had been deleted in the original run were added.

If you want the complete version, you must acquire the Spanish version V.O. 2 (version corrected with added scenes). That blu-ray is ok for regions A and B. Apparently, the Australian version is also unblocked for region A.

Shout Factory, issuing the North American version, was informed by the fans of this problem and so far, have not done anything to correct it. So avoid buying this product....",1454112000,33,818,4.713286713286713
7538846,5,B0182W7JSS,"Movie is definitive Life of Christ. However, this upcoming blu ray edition advertized as the Complete Miniseries , according to Shout Factory still has 2 missing scenes. Why bother to release it if it's not complete. I anticipatea lot of complaints. Now that Shout has heard the thoughts of the public hopefully they will make a serious attempt and track down the completely uncut original negative. Maybe they should try NBC.This  is NOT the 40th anniversary either. 2017 will be the 40th anniversary so maybe Shout can give us a proper 40th anniversary edition with the 2 deleted scenes restored. Whoever saw the Last Supper in any other film in which the denial by Peter and the betrayal by Judas are cut out. Shout has demonstrated a like it or leave it attitude and they should correct both the attitude and the discs if they want any of my business in the future.",1453161600,26,869,4.6797385620915035
7538847,5,B0182W7JSS,"I have seen nearly every movie on the life of Christ, and there is no equal to the miniseries, Jesus of Nazareth, in scripture-based accuracy and sensitive portrayal of His life, mission, teachings, and sacrifice.  The movie is spell-binding, profoundly touching, and fairly accurate in the historical depiction of the time that Christ lived.  I have seen this movie so many times that it is now beyond count.  I never tire of seeing it.  I never cease to be moved to my core by this portrayal of Christ.  This movie receives my highest recommendation!",1451692800,25,552,4.829787234042553

This particular production of Christ's life holds up due to the incredible production value, and its stellar cast of international stars. The only thing I would caution is the extra feature.

This is an awesome blu ray transfer! Although at least one reviewer claims that the quality of the blue ray is ""ugly"", you have to remember not only that this film was made in 1977, but also that it was made for TV. So, you have to consider what they had to work with. You can only do so much, but the difference between the DVD and the Blu Ray is amazing.

7538921,4,B0182W7JSS,"Hold on, guys. How about a little perspective?

I've seen a number of one-star reviews blasting this release for being incomplete. And how incomplete? A mere nine minutes. Look, I'm not thrilled the scenes in question aren't present, but no release of any work of art is unblemished. So let's rate the released product, not the product we wish had been released.

For starters, the transfer to blu-ray is miles above the wretched (unwatchable, in my opinion) 1999 DVD release. That release--which crammed six hours of gorgeous footage onto two DVDs--was a travesty worthy of one star, but the new blu-ray was given a proper transfer. No, the producers did not oversee a frame-by-frame restoration (the thing is 40 years old, after all)but the end result looks good (parts 1 and 2) to great (parts 3 and 4). I was happy to pay only $15.00 for a decent production that looks and sounds this good, decades after being shot.

Then there's the film itself. Does it hold up? Yes, quite well. The performances by Powell, Ian McShane, Ian Holm, Christopher Plummer, Rod Stieger, and Michael York are far, far beyond what one would expect to see in a TV production. Powell's performance is iconic. So there's that. The film score by Maurice Jarre (Lawrence of Arabia) elevates the story quite a bit. As for Zeffirelli's direction, top notch. Some of the scenes are staged so well, they'll stay with me for years.

I've heard some griping about the extras. Sure, I'd like more, but, again this is a fifteen-dollar purchase. As for what is included, I particularly liked hearing Michael York's reminisces about both his career leading up to Jesus of Nazareth and his experiences making the film. The other extra is a newly shot, hour-long look at the historical accuracy of the film, as viewed by a religious scholar (I forgot the gentleman's name), which helps the viewer better appreciate the lengths Zeffirelli went to in his attempt to place his work in a realistic setting.

So why do I give this masterpiece only four stars? Earlier reviewers have already pointed out that the blu-ray's producers left out a scene-selection option. That's a problem when you're dealing with an epic, 6-hour film. Due to time constraints, twice I had to stop watching the film before one of the four parts ended, and it was a bit of a pain to find my way back to where I'd left off when I went back to it the following day. Since the scene-selection feature is standard by this point, it seems an odd thing to leave out.

Maybe in another twenty years someone will go through the original footage, clean it up, restore those missing scenes, and add a scene-selection feature. For now, this release is four-star all the way.",1461801600,,2700,4.746268656716418

I was extremely disappointed in the DVD version because it was grainy and simply a bad transfer. If NBC were to replay this, they would surely restore it first. SO, IS THIS RESTORED OR NOT? From the many comments (and past experience with Shout! entertainment) this is probably just a transfer from the DVD version. How they managed to cut scenes is beyond me, unless it was intentional.
This is truly the BEST version, TV and Theatrical, of the life of Jesus Christ to-date. You want passion. This has got it. Michael York gives the most passionate John the Baptist, ever. As a child I had watched 'King of Kings' with Jeffrey Hunter and loved it. After seeing this version, I realized that King of Kings is so 1960's 'campy'. Hard to believe people actually acted that way . . . ever. This is how it must have actually been.
Another note for all of you who are re-purchasing movies on blue-ray: NOT ALL BLUE-RAYS ARE IN 1080 High Definition FORMAT. Make sure you read the back label (difficult to do on Amazon). Unless it's it a new release film, don't count on it having been restored.",1459814400,,1191,4.442922374429224

Also, the picture up until part 4 seemed fine and crisp, but then the color would shift as a scene would happen and skin tones would be off and the color of Robert Powell's blue eyes (yes, they are blue...even if they photoshopped the cover to be overtly so) looked green at best and brown most of the time.

7538939,5,B0182W7JSS,"Jesus of Nazareth: The Complete Miniseries 40th Anniversary Blu Ray Edition

I was a fan of this 1977 mini series and watching has become a Easter tradition. Originally, Jesus of Nazareth premiered 40 years ago today, 27 March 1977 on British television; and made its American premiere as an NBC Easter special, on 3 April 1977. I remember watching it live that premiere week on a 13"" color television with no remote. NBC rebroadcast the series in 1981 and four more times through 1990s.

It was originally released as a three-tape VHS edition in the early 1980s under the Magnetic Video label. VHS home players were new at this time. The orginal VHS Box set sold for over $50.00.

The three-tape edition was one of the only VHS cassettes available to ""check-out"" and watch in my college library. So, I watched this series many times.

It was released later under the mainstream video label of CBS/FOX in 1986. Another three-tape VHS edition was released by LIVE Home Video in 1992 and once more on 22 February 1995. Artisan Entertainment released the DVD version on two discs on 6 December 1999. In the UK, the original 1986 Polygram VHS (4 tapes) was fully uncut and featured the full 386 minute version. The 2000 Carlton video (2 tapes) featured a heavily abridged print running 270 minutes. Although the Granada DVD is credited as the unedited print it runs for 374 minutes and misses out 2 scenes - a private meeting between Judas Iscariot and Zerah, and the opening betrayal sequence during the Last Supper.

This is nice (2) Disc Blu Ray release from Shout Factory with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 1.33:1. There have been a variety of previous international Blu-ray releases of this title, some at least evidently sourced from different masters (and at least a couple sporting different lengths--this version omits several minutes that were seen in at least some versions of the miniseries, though it's instructive to note that the IMDb lists the Italian theatrical version of this as having been significantly shorter than even this version).

This is not the greatest restoration experience to date. But if your a fan of this television mini-series like I am, its far better than anything to date. Much better than the 1980's VHS. The negative reviews in my opinion are over the top critique. I was pleased with the edition and believe it is worthy of purchase. I wish there were better 'special features"" and scene selection ability. I almost got sucked into the negative reviews. This is not the greatest restoration but much much better than anything to date! Better than streaming quality and you own it!

Going into full videophile mode: I use a OPPO BDP-83SE, which allows a ""zoom"" ""picture adjustment full screen"" option. I rarely use this zoom option because it departs from the directors intent. But in the case, I believe it is the right setting and truthfully the intended viewing option. Having this OPPO Blu ray player picture adjustment brings this film to full life. 40 years later, on Easter, this is a great film to revisit. Just as good as it was live on a 13 inch color television.

If this mini-series is new to you, it is about the life of Jesus which is majestically and movingly portrayed in one of the most magnificent miniseries ever created. Acclaimed director Franco Zeffirelli and an all-star cast come together to deliver a powerful adaptation of the Gospels in 1977's Jesus Of Nazareth. From the Nativity to the Crucifixion and Resurrection, the life of Jesus (played by Robert Powell) is presented with stunning depth, gravity, and emotion. Acclaimed by critics and viewers alike, Jesus Of Nazareth remains one of the finest depictions of the story of Christ nearly forty years after its release. Olivia Hussey, Anne Bancroft, Ernest Borgnine, Valentina Cortese, James Earl Jones, James Mason, Ian McShane, Christopher Plummer, Donald Pleasance, and Sir Laurence Olivier co-star in this rewarding, uplifting and faith-affirming portrayal.

7538955,3,B0182W7JSS,"I wish I could rate this higher, because this series is outstanding, but the three stars has to do with the quality of the film. In short, I have a blu-ray from Mexico that I bought of this same film last year, and this ""new"" 40th Anniversary Edition, is exactly the same print, with the same dust particles, scratches and faded colors that the Mexican blu-ray has. Obviously, this is a copy made from an old print of this series twenty or thirty years ago, because the colors have faded alot, although, compared with the DVD print of this released twenty or so years back, which I also bought, this is somewhat of an improvement. The best thing about this release is the subtitles, which help the viewer understand all the names and soft-spoken words which are often muttered. But, really, why couldn't these people find the Original Negative? Has it been lost? For a 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray Edition, shouldn't they have restored and remastered ""Jesus of Nazareth"" from the original negative? They finally did this for ""Spartacus"" last year, after releasing an inferior version ten years back, and the new blu-ray of ""Spartacus"" is breathtaking. All the colors leap out at you and are beautifully balanced, and it looks as if it had been made last year. Couldn't they have done the same here? They have remastered and restored ""Lonesome Dove"", another TV series, and that also looks superb, so it is possible. Instead, they worked from an old copy of a copy of a copy from the original negative, where the colors have lost their luster, except for some close up scenes and well-lighted visuals which give you a glimpse of the power that the original colors must have had, way back in 1977.

So, who has this negative? I think this is a crime and that The Criterion Collection should  search for the original negative of this unique film and redo it from scratch, meticulously repairing and restoring this masterpiece. It is a shame. I won't buy another one until this is done. The film is beautiful, but the poor quality of the copy distracts your eye from the story, because you hunger for it to leap out at you, the way the blu-rays of ""Ben Hur"", ""Cleopatra"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" all do. They were all done the right way. I think ""Jesus of Nazareth"" has just as many fans as those older films do, and that we should begin a campaign to find the original negatives and have this done as beautifully as it can be.

  As far as the Blu-Ray is concerned it is a big improvement on the DVD, although it's not as consistent as I had hoped. Some scenes are gorgeous and other soft and grainy, I suspect the source material has a lot to do with it, overall I'm happy with the HD blu-ray , Just hoped it carried its HD look throughout the entire movie. Also it came with some good Extras with Michael York interview and Jean-Pierre.
  Now, The Missing 2 scenes. Yes they are missing and does this ruin the movie. NO,  you can see the missing scenes on YouTube and also on DVD (artisan edition) among other sources. They are good scenes and should have been included (particularly because it states Complete on the cover). But these scenes don't  make/break the Movie, just a shame their missing.

Supposedly it is 384 minutes but it's actually missing 11 minutes out of the longest version out there that even imdb doesn't list.  The big one for me is this is still the pan and scan release.  If everyone still had square tv's they wouldn't be missing much.  and indeed I don't believe this was shot for widescreen however it's still not in it's original size  which I believe is 1:37:1  compared to pan/scan at 1:33:1.

This seems to be the second releasse from Shout Factory that has issues.  The first one was Street Hawk DVD set in which either the case is broken or the dvd's are broken to scratched up in a very cheep case.
