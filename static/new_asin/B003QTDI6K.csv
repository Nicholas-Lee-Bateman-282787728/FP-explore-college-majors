4172068,5,B003QTDI6K,"During the winter months here in Montana, my young cat does not want to go out in the cold for hunting fun, so she just looks for something to do in the house and keeps pestering me to play with her... but I have to get work done! So I tried showing her some YouTube videos, and discovered that she was totally intrigued. Then I started buying some cat videos online, and have tried a number of these. Well, I am choosing to write a review of this particular one because it has turned out to be the one she enjoys the most--it really keeps her interested. There are various scenes of different bugs moving around across the screen, and it is perfect the way the filming allows the bugs to move rather than lots of zooming in and out with the camera. So if you are wondering if this one is worth buying, I say yes!",1364083200,3,813,4.1847133757961785
4172069,5,B003QTDI6K,"I have 2 indoor cats, 8 months and 4 years.  On the Mewvie, the young one loves butterflies. The seasoned older one loves stink bugs. At first they were hohum but now they like to watch and play with the screen. The older one even hoisted herself on top of the TV to scan the ceiling for some birds or bugs.  Very entertaining for them.  However, I don't run them continuously for hours because the cats can get over-stimulated, then need to take a nap. Even I like to have it on and am tickled by the bugs and the cats trying to catch them. The DVD has several different types of bugs.  Water beetles is my favorite.",1357776000,2,617,4.203389830508475

8402597,5,B003QTDI6K,My daughter & I have one of most amazing and loving cats!  He loves this video and will place himself right in front of the TV to watch and enjoy this movie. It brought tears to our eyes when we saw his reaction and pure joy!,1461715200,,225,3.891304347826087

8402599,5,B003QTDI6K,Bought this for my daughters cat who loves it. Only bad part was she wanted to attack tv trying to get the birds. Kept her attention watching it and even going behind tv trying to find them. Not all cats are interested as a few of our  7 cats have no interest but we have the real birds right outside the window.,1453075200,,312,4.032258064516129
8402600,1,B003QTDI6K,"Do not recommend this product. There is very little action movement. Two bugs cross the right bottom corner of the screen then disappeared this happens a few times. By now my cat had left and went to sleep.
 Other cat movies he watches with excitement. Unfortunately I purchased both versions together. Second was just as disappointing .",1447632000,2,337,4.912280701754386
