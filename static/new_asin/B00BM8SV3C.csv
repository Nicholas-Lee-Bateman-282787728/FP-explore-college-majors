8570705,1,B00BM8SV3C,"This is a 2012 film called ""Population 2"" that didn't do well so it was re-titled and repackaged and placed in Walmart ($9.88 US) for idiots like me to buy. Lilith (Suzanne Tufan) has survived the doomsday event as she walks around in a gas mask and narrates and has boring flashbacks which consume the stories' subplot and various themes. It takes place about 20 years in the future.

It seems Omni Tech has saved the planet with a $450 trillion dollar sun shield (I think that is more money than every existed in the history of the planet, but just go with it). Things go bad, planet heats up, riots, and then for some reason we drop the big one. Seems the company has selected a core group to survive...somewhere, but it was too expensive to develop more dialogue.

The themes seemed to be about corporate vs. people control; corporate media control, and technology vs technology. The acting was extremely bad. The dialogue could not have been worse. This is one of those films people will cliche about getting 90 minutes of their life back and wishing they could give zero stars.

Congrats Gil Luna on getting this into Walmart.
