2839068,4,B000QJMSAK,I love this movie! aside from the girl sophie who is completely oblivious to what is going on and I would have liked to see what happened to alex(how he died).,1372723200,,159,4.161290322580645
2839069,2,B000QJMSAK,It wasn't the type of movie I enjoy; I thought it was going to be a different movie.  This started off slow and I turned it off....just couldn't get into it ):,1372118400,,159,3.96875
2839070,2,B000QJMSAK,"This movie was very slow and boring for me. The character Alex was very creepy,and you could tell he was some sort of social path,but his character was hard to figure out. A few times I thought the movie was about to take of and we really begin to see some things about Alex,but then it would go back to being slow and boring. I love a action packed movie that has a plot that builds and keeps you guessing,and all I wasnted to was for this movie to hurry up and get to the end. This is one movie I wish I had not rented.",1356998400,,521,3.9245283018867925
2839071,4,B000QJMSAK,"I believe it takes place starting out in Sydney and then moves into the Australian deserts. Guy no. 1 meets another guy no. 2  in the city.  They go bar-hopping meet some girls then move on.  Guy no. 1 picks up his girl friend on the way.  Guy no. 2 starts creeping guy no. 1 out.  This is where the story really begins.  It is a good story line, some good cinematic photography -- some beach, some city, but mostly desert or barrens.",1355961600,2,434,4.168674698795181

8196641,5,B000QJMSAK,This was such a sad movie! I love the guy from Endevoure he is a great actor but so is the peaceful warrior.,1477180800,,108,3.739130434782609
8196642,5,B000QJMSAK,"I really liked the slowly building and subtle suspense in this movie. I loved the performance of Alex - Shaun Evans being one of my favorites - but the role of Taylor, one of the main characters, is very well played and psychologically VERY accurate. He is very calm and is taking his time, getting under your skin and enjoying the slow realizations that his fellow travelers come to, probably at the same pace your would have them if you were traveling with him. I cannot understand how other reviewers do not see what is happening in this movie and how MUCH is happening in quiet ways - thereby giving it bad ratings. People like Taylor exist in various degrees in real life as well and you should avoid them at all cost - even if your encounter with them won't end like this film.",1453852800,2,783,4.406896551724138
8196643,5,B000QJMSAK,"Oh My....I LOVED this movie. The plot line very slowly takes over, and scene by scene, I was gripped by a horrid fascination. Aloof Alex meets his lovely Sophie, who really is a charming young woman.  In the way, ON the way, Alex is ""picked up"", by an equally charming stranger...Taylor. I absolutely DON'T want to add ANY spoilers, but there are moment in this film that actually had me gripping my seat.
Anyone who ever travelled with friends, to foreign countries, living on the cheap, in their 20's...(I did it in the 70's, lots of young people did that (and some still do,where it's considered SAFE) soul searching journey sometime between the end of High School and the beginning of college). For me, it was Europe, 70's was VERY cool...BUT two young people, two young WOMEN, traveling on their own, are certainly easy targets, for those of ""bad intention"".
These young folks are in for an incredibly challenged ""vacation""....no spoilers, but there are some very disturbing sequences that are guaranteed to provide the parents of such a roaming child more than a few sleepless nights. I was thoroughly chilled. This was my favorite movie for MONTHS. (And I like'em chilling, believe me.  Try to ignore the spoilers on this review site, OK? If you scare easily, or worry, about your kids travelling to foreign countries), easily, You should PROBABLY skip this one! Although,I have to say that the score was really unique, and I tried to download SOME of the songs...I really liked the music, too.  Enjoy, and ignore the Haters!",1422489600,5,1532,4.8396946564885495
8196644,4,B000QJMSAK,I really liked it.  Travel.  Suspense.  Intrigue.  Things not being as they seem.  Good watch.,1420156800,,94,5.0
8196645,2,B000QJMSAK,"Gone (Ryan Ledwidge, 2007)

I continue to lack an understanding of why this film has ever been, much less continues to be, compared to Wolf Creek. The two films don't even reside in the same genre of film, much less the same subgenre. Gone is an attempt at a cerebral thriller, far more in line with the various attempts to adapt the Ripley novels than a Wolf Creek-style gore film. The comparisons are sure to create unreasonable expectations in the minds of potential viewers; I can tell you this from personal experience. Not that I would have found the movie good had I known what I was getting into anyway; that just added an extra level of disappointment.

Plot: Alex (Cashback's Shaun Evans) is on his way into the hinterlands to meet up with his girlfriend Sophie (Quills' Amelia Warner) hor a vacation. On his way, he stops for the night in Sydney, and meets Taylor (Peaceful Warrior's Scott Mechlowitz) in a bar. The next morning, Alex wakes up after a night of drinking far too much with Taylor and finds himself next to a woman. Taylor has photographic proof. That's not creepy, right? Taylor offers Alex a ride, they pick up Sophie, and then the fun begins.

Or what should have been fun, but somehow managed to be dull as dishwater from first frame to last. There are so many places where this movie seemed like it should have been so much better than it was without ever actually seeming to aspire to get there. The cast is comprised of fine young actors, and all of them do capably here. The Australian landscape is gorgeous by default. Both of these things end up being more frustrating than anything, hamstrung as they are by a goofy script and a sense of pace that seems to have been plotted out by a meth addict, but only in between jolts. I think if someone had filmed a staged reading of this movie, I would have probably liked it better than what we actually got. **",1413763200,,1889,4.501457725947522
8196646,4,B000QJMSAK,I saw this movie on TV. And loved it. I later learned to my dismay that it wasn't available to buy in the US. It's only available for region 2 DVD players. I was crushed. Until I found it on amazon instant videos. Now I can watch it whenever I want. Scott Mechlowicz is amazing in this movie (not to mention hot). He plays a psycho well.,1408147200,,337,4.044776119402985
8196647,5,B000QJMSAK,great to work with,1407715200,,18,3.75
8196648,2,B000QJMSAK,"Not really my cup of tea. It's a good job of foreshadowing the dark climax, but said climax comes too little and too late for me. Better you should watch In Fear, a much more suspenseful and beautifully done film with the same essential triangle of characters in the spotlight.",1405641600,,277,4.56
8196649,5,B000QJMSAK,"This movie is full of suspense!!! I felt tension, anxiety, and apprehension about what was going on and what would happen next.  If you like to be thrilled without all the gore this is the movie for you.",1383868800,2,203,4.342105263157895
