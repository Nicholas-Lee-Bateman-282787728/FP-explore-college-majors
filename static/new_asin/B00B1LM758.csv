8560960,1,B00B1LM758,"Alice Through the Looking Glass (BBC, 1973-tvm). Running Time: One hour, 14 mins.
Directed and written by James MacTaggart.

Based upon the second book written by Lewis Carroll (pen name) of Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871).
  His real name was Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898).

It is snowing outside. Alice (Sarah Sutton) is playing with her young black cat about chess. She imagines the reflection in the looking glass above the mantle of her fireplace is another drawing room. She pushes her hand on the mirror and magically is transported into Wonderland again.

Also in the cast: Brenda Bruce, Richard Pearson, Judy Paffitt, Geoffrey Bayldon, Freddie Jones, Stephen Moore, Jonathan Cecil, Anthony Collin, Raymond Mason, Bruce Purchase, Stanley Lebor, Robin Wentworth, Nicholas Jones, June Watson, Vivienne Moore, Ian Trigger, Douglas Milvain, Jeffrey Segal, Richard Speight.

Recorded in video format. Most of the special effects is done by blue screen using drawings as background.

I could barely get through this old British-version. I could not wait for it to end.  I would have rather watched an old Doctor Who episode.  Sarah Sutton would later play ""Nyssa"" in Doctor Who in 1981-84.

Freddie Jones plays ""Humpty-Dumpty"". You might recall him from The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78), Pennies From Heaven (1978) or The Elephant Man (1980).

Language in English. Option of subtitles in English SDH.

8560961,3,B00B1LM758,"Considering the time-frame this made it is a pretty good adaptation. Too many versions mix the Wonderland story with through the looking glass, but this one did not. Since it was made at the beginning of the use of green backdrop it is extremely obvious in some scenes that the foreground and ground were filmed separately and put together later, but this is the only version I have seen where it was used for the garden scene with the talking flowers in which to film the flower faces with only stems below, which I liked, and do not understand why the following versions did not do that scene the same way.",1457395200,,608,4.486486486486487

8560964,4,B00B1LM758,"What's good: Truest rendition of Looking Glass I can recall, and that puts it way ahead of most. Great Humpty Dumpty - and I've heard literary analysis from the recent generation of intellectoids that made a lot less sense. Then, my favorite: the White Knight, possibly Carroll's way of injecting his real-world self into this lovely bit of nonsense.

What's not: the effects. There's an awful lot of primitive green-screen work, with mismatched foreground and background, feet sliding in thin air (not when they're supposed to), and more. Visually, this flick sits way down my my preference list, but the story-telling very nearly makes up for it.

8560965,4,B00B1LM758,"I'm a collector of all versions of Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass that I can get on DVD. This is a must have for not only collectors, but for anyone! There are very few versions of Through The Looking Glass, and I was very excited about receiving this one. Although it is old and a bit ""cheesy"", I think it was done beautifully. The little girl who played Alice is adorable and quite a good actress. The one thing I don't understand, is why she is shown on the front and back covers as wearing the well known blue dress, when throughout the entire film she is wearing a yellow dress. I know it's not of great importance, but it just bothered me. But all in all, I loved this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone.",1395446400,,740,4.25531914893617
8560966,5,B00B1LM758,I purchased this for my daughter who collects every Alice movie she get her hands on.  I am sure she will be enjoying this if she hasn't already watched it.,1380153600,,156,4.2
8560967,4,B00B1LM758,"This is the 1974 BBC production of Alice Through the Looking Glass, which drew me in as a child on Public Television.  The actress playing Alice is Sarah Sutton, who later became famous playing Nyssa on Doctor Who.  I think the page should be edited to reflect this.",1371772800,4,266,4.520833333333333
8560968,5,B00B1LM758,I find it interesting just what a movie left in or took out from the book. Each movie adds or takes away from the book just enough to make it something worth seeing .Different actors and actresses add to the movie.,1371686400,,214,4.2439024390243905
