7810453,4,6301251989,"really an absolutely dreadful antidrug propaganda piece. the kid who uses drugs is alienated and ostricized by his peers. no adults attempt to contact his parents until the police are involved. no adults attempt to sit him down and ask him hey kid, why are you smoking weed? where did you get it? your folks are obviously dropping the ball, maybe we can pick it up.

essentially teaches children that anyone they meet with a drug problem should be treated like a victim and a criminal, and not given help.
Oh, and if your friend hangs out with new people, gets a new nickname, and adopts a new style? immediately get suspicious! anything new is BAD!

Latoya jackson did the ""just say no"" musical number which is also kind of twisted. she was in an extremely abusive relationship which essentially controlled where and when her talent was used. you can practically hear her mental state in the joyless repetitive lyrics.

the nancy reagan talk spot might be the hilight, where she acts like the flintstone kids are real and children should emulate them.

absolute trash. as a collector of antidrug propaganda, i love it. but if you're looking to teach children how to deal with drugs, i'd ultimately suggest you instead try the Galaxy High School episode ""The Brain Blaster"" - in THAT, we're not only shown reasons why a kid might use drugs, but his peers stick by him and help him through it, forgiving him.",1447113600,3,1407,4.684210526315789

7810455,5,6301251989,this is a super good anti-drug special for kids to learn that drugs are bad for you,1409616000,,83,3.9411764705882355
7810456,5,6301251989,"I am a third grade public school teacher. I am also the director of a drug awareness program. I have seen just about every video out there that deals with drugs. The Flinstone Kids: Just Say No,is an outstanding video to  teach young kids about drugs. It gets right to the point and keeps young  kids entertained and INFORMED. I don't understand why the ABC network only  showed it once. It was from an ABC kids' special in 1988. Recently, my copy  was stolen and I'm trying everything to try and locate a copy. It should be  part of any Drug Awareness program.",959299200,14,561,4.407766990291262
