5896017,4,B00E8RKHWW,"Ah, the buddy cop movie. Such a fun and familiar genre from when I was growing up amidst the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"" and it's ilk. It's not seen as much anymore, and when this type of movies does come around these days, it never holds a candle to the movies they are emulating. While ""The Heat"" doesn't ascend to the heady highs of the genre at it's best or comes close to classics in the category, it's still the best of it's kind I've seen in a very, very long time.

Sandra Bullock (seriously, does this woman ever age? She's as beautiful now as ever) stars as Special Agent Sarah Ashburn, a super smart agent that none of the other agents like. When she is put on the case of a dangerous drug lord in Boston, she unwillingly meets up with street-wise, bullying, harsh, and potty mouthed Detective Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy, the new queen of comedy). This odd couple are soon at each other's throats as they both try to adhere to the different working skills of one another and to get this dangerous criminal off the streets.

""The Heat"" is a action/comedy and it makes no bones about it. It knows what it is and sets out to satisfy the needs of the audience looking for such a thing. Nothing more. Nothing less. Sometimes, that's just all we need. Even though we don't usually see two female leads in such a movie, the movie is still not ground breaking or revolutionary. It doesn't re-invent the wheel and simply doesn't care too. It's here to be funny and entertaining and it accomplishes just that. The pairing of Bullock and McCarthy is a stroke of genius. They are a great pair together with a lot of chemistry and on screen appeal working with one another. The character of Sarah Ashburn should be right at home with Bullock and her fans, if the violent and profanity laced movie itself isn't. Still, it's a nice change of pace for her. McCarthy, coming hot off the heels of the mega success of ""Identity Thief"", is a force to be reckoned with. This seems to fall well into her type of comedy here lately, and there is nobody else like her currently working in this genre of comedy. As I mentioned earlier, she is certainly the new reigning queen of comedy. There are also more familiar faces here that include Jane Curtin (""Saturday Night Live"", ""Kate & Allie"", ""3rd Rock From The Sun""), Thomas F. Wilson (""Back To The Future""), Marlon Wayans, Michael Rapaport and even New Kids On The Block singer Joey McIntyre as one of McCarthy's brothers.

Director Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"") moves things along at a pretty brisk pace, but the movie does start to feel a little long and sluggish towards the end, and the amusement of the F-bomb being dropped all the time does get a bit old after a while as well. Still, these aren't much in the way of complaints that ruin the simple fun of a popcorn movie like this. If this were to turn into a new buddy/action franchise, I certainly wouldn't say no to a The Heat 2.",1372636800,,2926,4.47565543071161
5896018,5,B00E8RKHWW,"What an epic movie!
This movie was genuinely hilarious! Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy are a dynamic duo who bring serious laughs to the big screen.
The movie centers around Sandra's character, Sarah Ashburn, who is a FBI agent looking to close a huge case and earn a hefty promotion.
When she's transferred to Boston on a case, she ends up partnered with a Boston-native cop, Mullins.
The two take down a serious drug cartel and bring gut-busting humor every step of the way. I highly recommend this movie though there is a LOT of profanity in it. (The f-bomb is dropped A LOT).

Alesha's rating:
10 out of 10 though not suitable for young children",1372550400,2,654,4.637931034482759
5896019,3,B00E8RKHWW,"It's been quite some time since we've seen ""Miss Congeniality"" on the big screen.  Since 2009, when she won an Academy Award (Best Actress) and Razzie Award (Worst Actress) in the same year, Sandra Bullock has only been seen on the big screen once - in 2011's Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.  While the A-list star has been away, Melissa McCarthy has reached new career heights of her own, becoming a household name by starring in a prime-time television comedy and in a handful of successful films, including Identity Theft and Bridesmaids.  Now, this highly unlikely pair has teamed-up in the law enforcement comedy, The Heat.

Directed by Paul Feig (Bridesmaids), The Heat stars Sandra Bullock as cocky FBI agent Sarah Ashburn and Melissa McCarthy as vulgar Boston detective Shannon Mullins - both looking to take down the same mobster that's been flooding the streets with drugs.  Even though she's highly disliked by her colleagues, Agent Ashburn is desperate to be promoted, and in order for her to be considered, she must solve the Boston drug case.  At the same time, Detective Mullins has ambitions and methods of her own to keep the streets she lives on clean, so much so that she's even put her own brother, Jason (Michael Rapaport) in jail.  Initially wanting nothing to do with one another, this diverse duo decides to put their differences aside for the greater good - as the shenanigans ensue.  Demin Bichir, Marlon Wayans, and Spoken Reasons also star in supporting roles.

The Heat has received quite a bit of attention for its vulgar dialogue, reportedly dropping the ""F-bomb"" an estimated 190 times.  I'm not sure what's more bothersome - the fact that a film needs to use that much vulgarity or the fact that someone actually sat through the film and counted how many times the F-bomb was dropped.  In any event, the language will either:  completely turn you off to the film and it won't bother you one bit.  If you're already a fan of Melissa McCarthy's brand of humor - especially her hilarious improve ability, you should feel free to enjoy this film like you did Bridesmaids.  On the other hand, Sandra Bullock has never been associated with this kind of obscure style of humor (at least not to this degree), often coming off as bland or ironic in films, such as Two Weeks Notice, Miss Congeniality, and The Proposal.

Comedy aside, the film's plot is hardly worth the price of admission - often focusing more on the Bullock/McCarthy dynamic than the overall quality of film.  The couple is completely unorthodox and easily comparable to Oscar and Felix from The Odd Couple.  Regardless, these two talented actresses complement each other extremely well, easily setting up the possibility for an endless amount of sequels (though more than one may be unbearable).  At one point in the film, Bullock even goes off-keel, taking of McCarthy's brand of humor by dropping a series of f-bombs of her own while sticking it to her colleagues.  This particular scene happens to be amusing, but several other scenes often suffer from Bullock trying too hard for laughs, leaving a forced feeling - including a bathroom scene (which was heavily promoted in the movie trailer) and a scene where she is pointlessly stabbed in the leg, which served very little purpose other than to contribute to an uneventful climax.

Surprisingly, there's not a whole lot going on in this film that's worth elaborating upon as far as the rest of the cast goes.  It's a main character driven film with a supporting cast that neither helps nor hurts the film, and that includes the normally derogatory Marlon Wayans - who plays a serious character that is completely unlike anything he's ever done before.  Perhaps the lack of character depth is one of the many reasons that the film's voids were filled with the cheap abundance of vulgarity and randomness.  Although, the insulting ""bull in a China shop"" references that are directed at McCarthy's character never lose their amusement.

From beginning to end, this is a comedy through and through.  It barely turns serious for more than one brief scene in the entire film, which isn't necessarily as problematic as it may seem.  The only real question is:  how will Sandra Bullock fans take this film?  Truth be told, The Heat might just be enough to traumatize her diehard devotees - but for film-goers that don't particularly care for her films (present company included), you might just want to give her another chance with her future endeavors.  Still, this is a Melissa McCarthy film, as she dominates the comedy and continues to earn herself a high amount of praise as one of the funniest leading ladies in all of Hollywood.  While Bullock's days as an A-list actress appear to be numbered, Melissa McCarthy's popularity will no doubt continue to soar far beyond its current levels.  Is she the next mega-star of Hollywood?  The signs say yes, but only time will tell.

5896020,5,B00E8RKHWW,As someone who didn't love bridesmaid I was skeptical of this movie but after seeing the previews I thought I would try it out. I laughed so hard I cried!! Melissa and Sandra make a perfect pair in this movie. Be warned this movie is truly a R rated movie and is full of bad language and inappropriate comments. But if that kind of thing doesn't bother you then it's an absolute must see!! I definitely plan on watching this movie again as I was laughing so hard I missed parts of the movie.,1372464000,6,491,4.23404255319149
5896021,5,B00E8RKHWW,"I've been waiting for this movie to come out, and saw it today on opening day.  I was not disappointed -- this movie was even better than I even thought it would be!  Melissa McCarthy is hysterical and delivers one-liners so fast, that I'm sure I missed some.  Sandra Bullock plays the great straight-man -- she is always spot on!  These two together are fabulous and the laughs are non-stop, but it also has a lot of great action in it.  I would rate this more than 5 stars if I could.  I will be buying this movie when it comes out in DVD!!",1372377600,3,542,4.163461538461538
5896022,5,B00E8RKHWW,"I just got back from seeing this film in theatres today, the day it opened - I loved it! Both Bullock and McCarthy are wonderful. The jokes (physical and verbal), pacing, chemistry, ending - all of it were wonderfully well done. I love seeing a plus-size action hero, and a funny one at that. Women are strong in this movie which even in this day in age, unfortunately, is not a given or even common. Definitely empowering for women. Men, be prepared to take the back seat on this one. The whole theatre was chuckling and laughing out loud regularly from beginning to end. Kudos to the entire creative and production team behind it! One of my all-time favorite comedies that I'll love re-watching.",1372377600,,697,4.629032258064516
5896023,3,B00E8RKHWW,"While not as raucously entertaining as, ""Bridesmaids"", there are plenty of laughs in the The Heat, Paul Feig's latest comedy.

Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy, bring their roles to life with easy familiarity. While we've seen these characters before: Bullock in Ms. Congeniality and McCarthy in Bridesmaids. it's still extremely enjoyable to watch them interact. Bullock and McCarthy have great chemistry. McCarthy delivers zingers at a rate so rapid, you're likely to miss more than half of them.

Overall, this is an entertaining flick. Lower your expectations and you'll have a great time.",1371772800,4,596,5.397849462365591

Makes me wonder if she was drunk or on drugs while doing this. McCarthy is not funny at all, cussing a blue streak does not comedy make. Bullock's line in the movie about McCarthy being mentally unstable I think is dead on. Certainly won't watch anything with McCarthy in the future. Glad the movie was so cheap.",1527033600,,453,4.469879518072289

There is a TON of very creative swearing in this that is gut-bustingly funny. Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy do play well off each other. I seriously would watch another flick with these two together. They really are that good as a comedic duo.

The extras on the DVD are pretty good especially the acting class given by the two leads which involves more Scotch tape than you thought possible (yes, it's goofy and out there). Director Paul Feig hosts all the extras in his usual satirical well-dressed well.",1526860800,,624,4.724770642201835

If I'm moody and need a laugh, I just watch this or Ghost Town or watch Melissa in a lip-synch battle with Jimmy Fallon, or as Sean Spicer.

I am not opposed to profanity if used judiciously but there was way too much in this movie and it was completely unnecessary. It seemed like they were trying to show that women could cuss just like men. Some scenes went on way too long; e.g when they are getting drunk at the bar before their car gets blown up. It's too bad I didn't read the reviews before ordering as I was in a hurry. I only ordered it because it was in a top 25 comedies list.

5896416,5,B00E8RKHWW,"This is a kind of female version of Lethal Weapon with Sandra Bullock as Murtaugh and McCarthy as Riggs, only not so much crazy as dedicated.

The cop buddy film from a feminine slant, with Sandra Bullock as the by-the-book FBI agent and Melissa McCarthy as the loose cannon Boston cop. With the promise of a promotion if she solves a certain case, Bullock is sent to Boston to do so. She has a perfect arrest record already, and that, along with her superior attitude and pedantic, priggish delivery has already earned her the enmity of her fellow agents. It's McCarthy, the slobbish, violent street cop whose case she takes over. Of course the two clash, there's the obligatory drinking scene where Bullock unwinds, and they bond to solve the case.

The film's funny and the violence isn't so much overt but rather more in the form of threats. The best scene for me is when the two invade McCarthy's refrigerator (the depository for her cache of weapons) and dress as commandos, ready to do battle to win back their reputations and get the bad guys.

The only objection might be the many use of curse words and vulgarisms. In one sentence early in the film, McCarthy uses the f-word four times in the same sentence, with more of the same plus others following.  After several conversations containing more of the same, it got boring as well as distracting.  In contrast, Bullock is more the ""Golly, Gee"" type, refraining until the very end when she burst out with a string of profanity both surprising and funny because of the awkward way she delivers them.

It may not be the ""funniest movie of the year"" as the case cover states, but it's a pretty enjoyable one with a couple of genuine laughs along the way.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1477094400,,1815,4.6006191950464395

I kept on clicking the forward button to get to the end (I immediately knew who the rat was -- who also turned out to be Larkin) because the movie was depressingly not at all witty.

5896441,4,B00E8RKHWW,"Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy are known as some of the best actresses of their time. From Bullock staring in Miss Congeniality and The Proposal to McCarthy killing it in Identity Thief and Bridesmaids, these two know how to make people laugh. They make a film their own and deliver a performance that will not be forgotten. Working together, this dynamic duo is unstoppable. The Heat is no exception. Director Paul Feig uses his creative talents to make this movie a roll-on-the-floor-laughing type of production that brings comedy to a new level. By masterfully combining a fairly simple, yet intriguing plot, superb acting, and seasoned directing, The Heat keeps people watching and laughing the whole time.
 Bullock plays FBI agent Sarah Ashburn while McCarthy portrays Detective Shannon Mullins of the Boston Police Department. Ashburn takes on a drug lord case that Mullins was in charge of and, from there, these two work together on busting the crime. Working together, though, is a stretch because this pair of highly opinionated women are constantly arguing. For instance, when interrogating a man in custody, they end up yelling at one another on how they should question him which accomplishes absolutely nothing except to give the audience a hearty laugh and a preview on how the rest of the movie will go.
 With such a simple plot, these two women are given a lot of freedom as to how they want to perform their roles and they do not disappoint. They are rather aggressive with one another and are very rugged, constantly swearing and making crude jokes with one another. However, they both take their roles in different directions. Bullock makes her character more reserved by acting as though she has composure of herself as a government agent, but then has some spastic moments to demonstrate that she is slowly cracking under pressure. McCarthy then takes her character to the extreme other end and is very rude and outspoken; she flaunts her body sexually when it is obvious she is not a sexy woman in this film. Because of these differences, they butt heads a lot, but the chemistry is undeniable.
Both women use very large, dramatic movements to take up the whole screen because both characters have larger than life personalities. In one scene, these personalities are evident when the women are supposed to look more normal in a club so McCarthy takes Bullocks suit and rips the pant legs and sleeves completely off. They scream at one another, but also maintain witty banter between one other that makes the lines seem as though they are just casual conversation. A script can only go so far, but they bring it to life and make it relatable.
 The directing, however, is what really pulls these two together for such a great comedy film. Feig creates a setting perfect for an excellent belly laugh; he constructs a contrast between the characters that they themselves cannot demonstrate. By giving Mullins an absolutely insane family who takes up the small camera view and fills the set, he develops a very hectic environment which tends to lead to a humorous encounter. Ashburn, on the other hand, is given only a cat to love and her home is presented with a wide camera angle to make her life seem empty and lonely. Through clever direction, Feig reveals to the audience that these two cops are about as opposite as possible.
 Clearly, The Heat is not just another buddy cop movie. The humor is indisputably evident and the female twist adds a new perspective to an otherwise male dominated type of film. Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy take the partnership to a real life friendship and that is not something that can be directed. The chemistry that costars have on and off the screen is a make or break for a movie and, because of these two top notch comedians,",1475539200,,3797,4.836923076923077

5896459,2,B00E8RKHWW,"I really like both actresses  and I think they were both above the language.  Whoever wrote the script was thinking, in my opinion, that people need to show their toughness by using unacceptable (to most people) language.  I am an avid reader and continually I see talented writers who do not need to resort to meaningless crudity to get their point across.  The screenplay demeaned the movie and the stars,  Oddly, in a traditional way, the plot was farfetched but fun so this made the heavy, obscene and over powering language so much more obvious.  I would not recommend this movie, will probably discourage others from watching it and would not watch it again but will look forward to seeing both McCarthy and Bullock in other movies.",1474416000,,738,4.771653543307087

5896529,4,B00E8RKHWW,"THE HEAT (2013) is a non-stop rollercoaster ride of Mel Brooks-type gags. The ""story"" across which these gags are planted centers on the amusingly implausible bonding and successful cooperation between two vastly different types of female law enforcement officers, well played by Sandra Bullock (as an uptight FBI Special Agent) and Melissa McCarthy (as a foul-mouthed, rough-and-tumble Boston police detective). Just as with most Mel Brooks' comedies, the gags suffer from a quality-control problem: few people will find all of them funny, and most people will find at least a third of them un-funny. HOWEVER, gross and obscene though many of the jokes often are, those that one does enjoy are often first-rate!

Within seconds, most viewers will find themselves in a comic world even farther from reality than Eddie Murphy's BEVERLY HILLS COPS films. Within 2 minutes this unreality will probably be accepted by most people. As THE HEAT proceeds, there may be ""bumps"" along the way (farther-fetched plot turns and/or grosser jokes) that will annoy some viewers. For me, the worst of several bumps was when Sandra Bullock blew a huge gob of nasal mucus out of her nose. I'm not squeamish, but I've never been partial to booger jokes; some other folks apparently love them.

I liked her and the other characters.  The funniest parts were when they really let her go and just rip on whoever it was she was giving it to.  As usual, Bullock was sort of there as the butt of the jokes and lukewarm.  I really had no problem with the movie as a whole other than it was just sort of formulaic and not funny enough overall.

Not an original plot but Bullock & McCarthy brought enough to the characters to create an on-screen collaboration that makes it work -- but this certainly wasn't my favorite movie. McCarthy's character in this and ""Bridesmaids"" was very similar - a loud, overbearing, trash-mouthed woman which, for me, is not her most appealing character but, overall, she did a good job with it. (Her best movie, in my opinion, was ""Spy."" Average Jane being put into extraordinary circumstances and dealing with them as most of us would, mistakes and all). Sandra Bullock was good as well but, again, the character seemed ""repetitious"" of other characters she's portrayed. Overall, the movie had fewer laughs than I expected from these fabulously talented women (however, some of the deleted scenes were hilarious. Not enough to warrant the cost of the movie but hysterical, nonetheless), which is why it only rates 3 stars for me.",1468281600,,1064,4.98314606741573

5896694,3,B00E8RKHWW,"This movie tried to reprise the winning formula of Miss Congeniality to lackluster aims. Melissa McCarthy is great in an ensemble cast, but here I think they must have had her improvise many of the scenes because they reminded me of my high school drama classes...with a lot of cursing. A lot. Curse words are what comedians overuse when they get nervous and have no script. All the juvenile slap fighting and yelling was annoying, and for the amount of comedians in this movie (Marlon Waynans, the guy from Mad TV, Bill Burr, etc) no one was that funny. There needed to be an acting coach on set. They put a lot of pressure on Melissa to carry the weight of all the comedy in this film. I love Sandra as always, but this movie was a chore to get through. Miss Congeniality was a great model for what this film was trying to do, but it just goes to show you can't regurgitate greatness.",1463788800,,886,4.375757575757576

5896725,4,B00E8RKHWW,"""The Heat"" probably won't go down in history the way ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Star Wars"" have because, let's face it, this is not a groundbreaking film.
The plot, for example, isn't original: Uptight FBI agent meets earthy local cop and they kick ass while learning how to become friends... I mean that's pretty much the basic scenario for every cop/buddy movie ever made.
That said, ""The Heat"" is an entertaining flick that doesn't pretend it's anything else. There are no sudden dramatic pauses while one character figures out the meaning of life while engaged in a running gun battle; no awkward moments where ""Something Significant"" happens to slow down the pace of the film. Nope, this is a buddy movie pure and simple and while it may not be of the same quality as ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" (possibly the best buddy movie ever) it's fun. Melissa McCarthy has taken a lot of heat from reviewers for swearing in the movie but, come on, she's supposed to be a cop in one of Boston's most crime-ridden precincts so I'm thinking the street-level dialogue is appropriate for her character. As for Sandra Bullock, well folks either love her or hate her and their reviews tend to reflect their particular bias. I thought she was fine in this movie. She didn't have to stretch much to play the role but she didn't mail it in either. To quote Raj from the ""Big Bang Theory"" (who IS a Bullock superfan) ""Sandy brings it every time...""
A great film?
Nope.
An entertaining one?
Yes.",1462406400,,1481,4.656488549618321

5896839,3,B00E8RKHWW,"The second half of the movie was great - the relationship between the two women became funny and endearing. The first half was too heavy-handed, the two characters were portrayed as lazy and extreme stereotypes until the second half brought a more unique and funny perspective.

5896862,5,B00E8RKHWW,A rather fast paced action-comedy with language and profane terms even this `maturing' Sailor hadn't heard. I mean... riding the cotton pony?? If profane language isn't your glass-of-Jack then move along... `nothing' to see here.,1456617600,,229,5.571428571428571

5896871,3,B00E8RKHWW,"Could have been funnier.  Didn't come together well for me. Bullock is more lighter comedy and McCarthy is gut wrenching funny, seemed a little off...like the two were meeting on the same road but passing each other by. Sandra is more of a central lead actress, and so is McCarthy. It seems a little odd to have both, but it was still funny just to have the two do this movie.",1456358400,,376,4.295774647887324

I think we watched even  'Ishtar' for 46 minutes.. nothing futher really needs to be said... other than we are both Sandra Bullock fans.. there's no ""Crash"" like material here!

Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock are on par with the best Newman and Redford style of comedy and I hope they team up often, as both are wonderful, fully entertaining actresses and bring great magic to the motion picture!

5897015,5,B00E8RKHWW,"The investigation of a violent drug turf war in Boston brings together a prim-and-proper FBI agent from NY and a hard boiled Boston undercover cop. Sounds like the typical odd-buddy cop film, right?  Hold on, the main characters in this comedy are Sandra Bullock and Mellisa McCarthy. Put a feminist slant on things and from there on it is a series of  wild and crazy moments. The two of them take on a lot of  really bad dudes and use all sorts of tricks to get information about a mysterious drug lord.

This is a fun film. Despite the very implausible story line, The Heat has a lot going for it. There is plenty of  action and lots of snappy dialog. The film is peppered with expletives that could be argued is a bit much, but the casting is so well done that most of it fits the story.  There are a many scenes that are very, very funny. Some of the scenes are a bit long and the banter is a bit over the top, but somehow the film works. However, when the characters try to get deep and meaningful, they don't exactly pull it off. Maybe if they were teenagers it would seem more believable.

There is a lot of great camera work and the action scenes are well executed. The Heat doesnt have CGI or a bunch of special effects. The stunt work is really good, too. It is refreshing to see a movie that relies on the acting of the cast and not on the post production stuff.
Bullock and McCarthy are ""The Heat"" - and they make this pic a load of fun to watch - highly recommend it!",1451952000,6,1480,4.190140845070423

Melissa McCarthy's character of a b*ll busting female cop, who threatens to kick the bottom of guy cops and has them all intimidated to mess with her is a hoot!
Sandra Bullocks character of a super smart FBI agent who doesn't work well with others, and non of the male FBI agents seem to like her much, is also hilarious!

I finially broke down and got it and was not surprised of McCarthy's role since she is great at playing off the wall characters.  I was pleasantly surprised with how well Bullock's charater balanced out McCarthy's.  I was a little surprised with the sailor language but actually enjoyed it very much.  Overall it was very funny but I felt that it lacked something and I can't quite put my finger on it, but I would still reccomend it to someone that likes the obscure off the wall comedy!
