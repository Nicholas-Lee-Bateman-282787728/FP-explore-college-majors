5545472,4,B00B1E6DQO,"This is a fascinating documentary on the Cuban Arts Schools Buildings, a group of structures designed right after the revolution by a number of architects, which was subsequently shut down as Fidel turned to utilitarian soviet-style buildings.  Both the aesthetics and the politics connected with the works are intriguing.",1398124800,,322,5.571428571428571
5545473,4,B00B1E6DQO,john loomis published 'revolution of forms - cuba's forgotten art schools' in 1999 an excellent publication highlighting the history of the art schools commissioned by castro immediately after the revolution and then summarily abandoned. this film expands upon the phenomena with some revealing and engaging interviews with the original architects. ricardo porro is often credited with the works but he is  the architect of one of the schools; the others were designed by the italian architects roberto gottardi and vittorio garatti. an excellent introduction to the schools for those who are not familiar and great insight and footage for those who are. the interviews with the extravagant porro are particularly good,1383004800,,718,5.468468468468468
5545474,5,B00B1E6DQO,"Great video Been there and want to go back. Well made documentry
You should not tell your customers how to write a review. Makes me feel like not doing this again",1371427200,,162,4.258064516129032
5545475,5,B00B1E6DQO,Unfinished Spaces leads us through the ideals of the Cuban revolution and three young architects who are asked by Castro to design and build schools with unlimited resources.  Shortly they find out the realities of life's limitations and the idealism that fueled their dreams is confronted with forces outside their control. The film slowly leads us through their experiences and we find the buildings as metaphors for all of our ideals that can never be fully recognized for reasons that have nothing to do with ourselves.,1367971200,,523,5.0813953488372094
5545476,5,B00B1E6DQO,"I saw this film at its NYC premier more than a year ago, perhaps two. It has stuck with me since that first viewing and my husband and I still talk about it today. The imagery of fallen buildings work so hauntingly, a beautiful manifestations as the storyline of Cuba's campaign for liberation turns to something less savory. The interviews are enchanting and bring much flavor and joybyo the experience of this film. The shots of Fidel caught my eye as world history merging with Cuba's heart story needing to be told. So worth a watch, invite some friends over that will enjoy delving into good conversation afterward, it's sure to envoke.",1367452800,3,641,4.732142857142857
5545477,4,B00B1E6DQO,Fascinating look into the post Batista architectural world in Cuba. Left me with an emptiness im that the structures they built remain unfunded.,1366588800,,144,5.304347826086956
5545478,4,B00B1E6DQO,"I searched to watch this movie because I love the architecture and the story is both inspiring and tragic.  The research is impeccable and engaging and tells the story of how this campus came about and why it was never finished.  The interviews with the key players are priceless and insightful.  I really wish there was more information on the buildings themselves.  All the info on the buildings themselves I read in articles from 50+ years ago.

Much of the movie is in subtitles.",1364860800,2,483,4.7023809523809526
5545479,5,B00B1E6DQO,"I had a chance to see a screening of this movie in NYC before the DVD was released...it is a fabulous movie! Well-researched and full of insightful interviews with the architects and many users of the space. I especially enjoyed the fact that some interviews were conducted in Spanish with English subtitles, while others were the reverse...I found myself getting so drawn into the film that I often didn't notice the transitions (and I'm not a Spanish-speaker)!

I highly recommend this film, whether you've been to Cuba or know nothing about the country. Either way you will surely learn a lot about a fascinating school, group of buildings, country, and its people.",1364860800,2,668,4.964285714285714

8560649,5,B00B1E6DQO,"I just watched the DVD of the PBS video, ""Unfinished Spaces"": the story of the National Schools of Art in Havana. I thought it was great and want to recommend it to anyone who has an interest in knowing more about these unique places. I visited the schools in March 2015.

Not only did the video trace the history of the project from the original, almost whimsical idea by Fidel Castro through the design and construction phases, the abandonment of construction but continued use of parts of the facility, efforts at restoration, and the current state of affairs, but also, in the process, it provided some real insights into the Cuban experience through the years since the 1959 revolution.

The film took 10 years to make and contains extensive interviews with the three main architects as well as others who were intimately involved with the project. There are also interviews with some students and graduates about their experiences at the school and how those experiences impacted their lives and their art. There are many very interesting still photos and videos of of the school in various states over the years. Quite a lot of the interviews are in Spanish with English subtitles; however, the original primary architect, Ricardo Porro, speaks and expresses himself very effectively in English. It's all woven together in a very cogent and poignant manner.

The DVD contains several bonus segments that were not part of the film itself showing scenes (comments by the architects and from audiences) from the 2011 premiere of the film in California as well as a couple of later screenings, notably in Havana and Miami. I don't know if the streaming video versions contain this extra material or not.

Hope you will enjoy seeing it as much as I did.",1429142400,2,1755,4.879194630872483
