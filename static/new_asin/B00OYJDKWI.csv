I have been out of the martial arts trainning for years and this video has helped me review what I already knew and teach me a lot as well.",1506729600,,282,4.1454545454545455
8685368,1,B00OYJDKWI,"For comic relief, look for his videos on YouTube.  LMAO!  This fraudster is an embarrassment to all the martial arts he claims to hold rank in.  This FRAUD has not got a single bit of basic fundamental understanding of any martial art.  With 28 years, and an actual certified Master (Sa Bom Nim) in the art of TSD, I have seen plenty of white belts with more skill, than this clown.  His garbage should be banned from Amazon!  Shame.

The previous reviews complimenting this DVD must be as fake as this guy and his ""credentials"".",1503446400,,529,4.505263157894737
