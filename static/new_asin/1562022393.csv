183180,3,1562022393,"I bought this movie very cheap and figured that it would be your run-of-the-mill, low budget, terrible B movie. It was not. This movie has suprisingly well-done special effects (for 1997). The script is very typical and the acting is OK. This movie borrows quite a bit from ""Predator"" as the waterfall scene at the end and the ""Creature"" resembles those of predator. Overall, this movie is  worth a look.

183181,1,1562022393,"I found this movie very poor. The story was nothing unusual and also the action wasn't too great. The special effects were outdated, even for 1997 and the acting was nothing that the actors should be proud of. I'm sure that the producers could have done a better job since many movies which are much older than this one have better special effects and better action (Aliens 1,2 and 3, terminator,...)

183183,3,1562022393,"I rented ""DNA"" last week from Blockbuster, and I kind of enjoyed it.  The creature, however, may not be what you are expecting, but the film's score helps make-up for that.
The film kind of has a moral to it  - about what mankind should experiment with and what they shouldn't.  The  film is also somewhat of a mix  between ""Jurassic Park,""  ""Alien,"" and ""Frankenstein,"" in which a scientist  creates a monstrous creature out of DNA and it goes on a killing spree.

This movie seems to point out all of the bad factors of genetic engineering, and also the mad scientist part  of Frankenstein?

This isn't really a horror film, more of a suspense Sci-Fi  thriller.  In places a bit of an Action Adventure ...
I won't bore you  all day with the details, but let's say it's Alien, Predetor, Tarzan, James  Bond, Jurrassic Park, and Primal Speces all moulded into one.  And it's  suprisingly good ...",955238400,,464,4.440476190476191

Heroes~A quasi-NativeAmerican RedCross doctor, a sexy lady FBI agent and a Shortround clone.
Villian~An evil archiologist (like in Indiana Jones, but eviler), and some native jungle henchmen.
Monster~An Alien looking green thing that can only be killed by...well, I don't want to ruin it for you.

It had a good amount of action, really good looking explosions, some parts that I truly didn't expect which made me kind of mad at the writers and directors. Even still I actually enjoyed it. I think it deserves a higher rating than what most people would give it. The only thing that would make me rate it lower is the so so acting of the main character.

Of course, Wessinger betrays Ash because he's after the beetle for his own nefarious reasons. Two years later, Ash is joined by Claire Summers, a CIA agent / doctor (is everyone in this movie a bloody doctor?). Together, they hope to track down Wessinger and discover what he's up to in his mysterious jungle facility. While DNA does borrow (steal) quite liberally from other, better films -PREDATOR, JURASSIC PARK, etc.- it's basically a flimsy sci-fi / adventure story w/ a murderous monster on the loose. The creature would have been much better if it had a more original look, rather than its ""Predalien"" appearance (w/ a crocodile's mouth tossed in). As it is, it's pretty distracting.

183217,4,1562022393,"DNA does borrow liberally from many movies, like T2, Jurassic Park, and Predator, but this film is original enough to give anyone an action-packed treat.  The story starts with some Burmese natives (in butt-cheek showing pants, which may induce giggles), digging in the jungle.  A prehistoric skeleton is found, much to the fright of the natives, and much to the delight of the evil genius scientist, Dr. Wessinger (Jurgen Prochnow). Wessinger approaches Dr. Ash, (Mark Dacascous) who is working in an ill-equipped clinic for poor natives.  Reluctantly, Ash agrees to accompany Wessinger on an expedition to some ruins deep in the jungle.  Oh, there is an homage to Raiders of the Lost Ark, also.  Bad things happen, and Ash is left for dead in the jungle.

Meanwhile, Wessinger and his team work to rebuild the creature from its DNA.  Wessinger has big plans for this creature, the one who is ancient native legend, and is called Balacai.  Native bodies begin to turn up in horrible condition.  It seems the natives are torn between fear and worship of the creature.  A lady enters the picture, a CIA operative sent to take the Balacai down.  An adorable little boy, whose sister was murdered by the monster joins in the hunt.

The scenery is gorgeous, the score very good, the acting is very good, the sets are good.  The CGI effects of the creature are pretty lame, though.  The strongest actors in the movie are the hero (Ash) and the mad scientist (Wessinger).  Dr. Ash is extremely easy on the eyes.  He reminded me of Jason Lee as Mowgli in the live action Jungle Book.  It is not fair for one man (Dascous) to be so smoking hot.  And when he takes off his shirt, I almost died from the thrill.  This man is STUNNING.",1373328000,,1724,4.6490066225165565

183219,2,1562022393,"This movie had potential.. but blew it quickly. The filming itself was good... as was the background music. The acting not bad. But the plot!!! Once it began unraveling it was very very clear they borrowed heavily from Alien, Predator and Jurassic park. To the point where some actual scenes were recreated such as the scene in aliens where the little girls hands come up through a grate. The scene in jurassic park before the mayhem when they're in the computer room and Samuel Jackson has a cigarette in his mouth while he tries to save the system is another.
The Special Effects for the monster were mixed. When it was CGI it was terrible, when it was a costume it fit.
If you have time to waste... this is wastable. Otherwise, don't go out of your way to find this one. It doesn't even fit in the 'B' category.",1334966400,,814,4.433333333333334

183222,5,1562022393,"Seriously, this movie is so amazingly bad that it is incredibly great to watch. I give this 5 stars for the helicopter scene alone.

Not only does this movie blatantly rip off Jurassic Park, Alien, Indiana Jones and the Predator, but does so with bad acting, over the top action sequences, cliches galore and special effects that make you go ""This was made in '97!!??""

Trust me, get some friends together, get a keg (or whatever else), and watch this movie. After you finish watching DNA you can use the keg ice to help your sore ab muscles heal from all the laughter inducing moments and Mystery Science Theater type comments unleashed during this awesome-fest.

We're talking Predator ripoff right down to a scene-by-scene basis.  There's also this ""heartfelt"" funeral for a character that we couldn't possibly care less about that's about enough to make you barf.  Then more scenes stolen directly from Predator.

183224,3,1562022393,"D.N.A. is a low budget, but effective, clone of the two PREDATOR movies in a lot of ways, particularly in the way the alien creature appears and reappears.

Mark Dascascos (usually in martial arts films) plays a sincere young doctor whose genetic breakthrough is stolen by nasty scientist Jurgen Prochnow.  Prochnow has genetically reproduced an alien creature with deadly powers and plans to sell it as a war weapon to the highest bidder.  Dascascos is joined by Robin McKee as a CIA doctor/operative to find this creature and destroy it.  A cute if somewhat irritating little boy leads them into the jungle where the creature has been killing the natives.  Most of the special effects are adequate, but there is one glaring bad one involving the crashing of an enemy helicopter.  The performances are okay, but Prochnow overdoes it a little, but that's expected with mad scientists I guess.

183225,3,1562022393,"What do you get if you combine the creature from Aliens with the setting of Jurassic Park and the capabilities of Predator?  Probably the movie DNA.
DNA is set in the jungles (I mean rainforests) of Borneo.  A talented researcher has moved his medical practice to a small town in Borneo.  His unscrupulous financier is out to steal his work.  Utilizing the DNA of a local beetle the bad guy is able to resurrect an ancient and powerful creature.  It gets loose and an investigation is started by a U.S. government agency.
The bad doctor is found hiding from his own creation.  The creature is very strong, fast and violent.  It finally falls to the good doctor to dispatch the beast.  Decked in war paint and wielding a poisoned ceremonial axe, he lays an ambush.  The ambush fails but the doctor escapes.  But when he is cornered at a cliff's edge, he manages to dive and shoot the creature with a grenade launcher.  All are happy.
The early scenes of the Borneo installation look just like the control room from Jurassic Park, even the characters seem to have been lifted from there.  The creature itself look very much like Geiger's Alien.  In the jungle battles the good doctor sets the same ambushes as in Predator.  While in the jungle, the creature has the ability to shift into invisibility (just like in Predator, again).  It really seems like someone took their favorite scenes to make this movie.  But it works.  This film has a real plot and real development.  It is not simply a group trying to avoid a monster until the survivors develop a desperate plan to kill it.  Instead it mixes local legend, science, espionage, weapons dealers and several other facets to create a whole which is much better than most in the sub-genre.",1082592000,4,1740,4.645901639344262
