5159167,4,B008FYZJ1S,"This movie was filmed in my hometown in the 80s.  I was not interested in being an extra in the film but many of my friends were and I had to watch it just to see them in the crowd scenes. When it was released on VHS the video stores couldn't keep  it in around here.  But I watched it a few times.  From the old cemetery that is 4 miles from my house, to the landmark Prater's Mill about 15 minutes away, I recognize everywhere this film is made.  Vincent Price is his scary self in this movie and the ghoulish premise along with the last 15 minutes are enough to make my skin crawl.  I have looked for this movie for years but could never find it at a reasonable price.  Then while searching for it yet again, I found it on a Vincent Price double feature that also has Theater of Blood on it.  I got them both for under $7.00 so I am very well pleased with this purchase.  I admit I haven't watched the DVD yet, but I have opened it and it is in pristine condition.  I'm sure it's just what I have been looking for all these years.",1399680000,5,1033,3.995121951219512
5159168,4,B008FYZJ1S,"From a Whisper to a Scream / Theatre of Blood double feature DVD features two films with the legendary Vincent Price. Both films are entertaining, with Theatre of Blood to be one of the best horror dramas starring Vincent Price. The overall production of Theatre of Blood is very good with some of the finest British actors starring. A high point of Theatre of Blood is the excellent musical score by Michael J. Lweis. I hope someday Theatre of Blood will be issued in Blu-ray. From a Whisper to a Scream is presented in anamorphic 1.85:1 and Theatre of Blood is presented in anamorphic 1.66:1, even though the DVD cover states 4x3 1.66. The picture and sound quality of both films are acceptable.",1386201600,14,697,4.67479674796748

5159174,3,B008FYZJ1S,"""Theater of Blood"" is a great horror classic with Vincent Price and Diana Rigg as horror father daughter evil duo, it was made on a higher budget than the AIP Price films. United Artists made it as part of their 50 GO Anniversary slate of films in 1969, the quality shows.
""From Whisper to a Scream"" is an awful film that Price disowned after it was recut and retitled by the lying producers who coerced him to appear near the end of his career when he was ill. SO you get Vincent Price in one of his very best films and worst. Double features are like that sometimes.",1440115200,4,568,4.268518518518518

5159179,4,B008FYZJ1S,"Two good movies in pretty good quality.

From a Whisper to a Scream is a pretty good horror-anthology.

With Theatre of Blood we get good effects, story, acting, and we get to see Vincent Price performing Shakespeare which is pretty awesome.

The only reason I give DVD only a 4 out of 5 is because it is pretty bare bones. Which I am fine with, but there is no chapter selection until you start the movies and there are no subtitle options.

I do recommend this DVD to fans of Vincent Price or horror-anthologies, but only at a good price. I wouldn't buy this for more than $10 at most, maybe $5 or less.",1401753600,7,605,4.280701754385965

8527533,4,B008FYZJ1S,"This DVD release by TGG of two Vincent Price offerings,From a Whisper to a Scream(released Sept/87) and Theatre of Blood(released April/73),is the best and most affordable way to get both films on one single sided DVD.The description of the DVD by Amazon says there are two discs,but this in error.
From a Whisper to a Scream finds Price as a librarian in a southern town called Oldfield. As the film opens we see his niece getting executed by lethal injection. A female reporter who witnesses it pays a visit right after to Vincent,who goes on to relate four strange stories that revolve around his house and the town,which he hopes would explain his nieces' dark behaviour.
The first story is indeed""strange"".It finds Clu Gallagher as an introverted and warped individual who cares for an invalid wife,but who has a crush on an office associate. He finally gets the nerve to ask her out for dinner. On the way home when he attempts to force himself on her,a struggle ensues and he accidentally kills her,dumping her body on the road. While her body lies in state at the local funeral parlour,he sneaks in and has sex with her. A few months later he ends up,out of frustration,killing his wife. That night a visitor arrives;his ""son"".Clu,needless to say,ends up dead beside his wife's body.
The second story is set in the early 50s. Terry Kiser is hiding out from a gang,but is outed by his jilted girlfriend. He is subsequently shot and flees into the nearby swamp. A recluse black man rescues him and nurses him back to health. But the black man has a secret. He is about 200 years old. Kiser wants that secret which his saviour won't give up. He drowns him in the swamp,but the black man comes back and knocks him out. When Kiser comes to he is tied up in front of the house. The man tells him that his potion is what saved him and he will live for at least another 70 years or more. He sets Kiser on fire and chops him up. The segment closes as Kiser lies in a hospital bed,and against all the medical odds is alive but destined to live out his days in gross disfiguration.
The third story is set in the 30s where a young girl falls in love with a carnival side show performer(Ron Brooks) who is able to eat anything,including razor blades and glass. Both are madly in love with each other but Brooks is reluctant to carry the romance very far. We soon see his secret. The carnival owner is a black woman who deals in sorcery. She owns not only the carnival but everyone in it,lock,stock,barrel and soul. When Brooks defies her and tries to run away with his love,the woman puts her spell on him and seemingly everything that he ever ingested comes out of his body, as his horrified lover looks on. As the story ends, his lover now takes Brooks place in the carnival sideshow as the woman who eats pins.
The final story finds screen veteran Cameron Mitchell as a tired but sadistic Civil War Union soldier. He is leading three other men who come upon a southern encampment. They end up killing them,but find out afterward that the war has already ended. Mitchell is unfazed. When one of his men goes to leave Mitchell shoots him for desertion. The(now)three soldiers continue walking and come to within four miles of Oldfield. Suddenly they are set upon by explosions. Before they know it they are taken captive by a group of children. One little girl likes Mitchell who reminds her of her father,who is now dead. Mitchell acts as if he likes her but he is soon strangling her to death. He is caught trying to escape by the very soldier he killed for desertion. Before his death,Mitchell gets to meet the ""magistrate"",who has been referenced many times during his captivity. It is an amalgam of body parts from all the children's parents. His punishment is to be set on fire.
As the entire film comes to a close,the reporter tells Price that his she and his niece became quite close. She describes her as a ""sensitive""person. She also tells Vincent she wanted to finally meet the man who poisoned his niece with terrible thoughts and leaves him with a present;a thrown knife to the throat. As Vincent dies he exclaims:""Welcome to Oldfield"".
The film overall is not as bad as some would lead you to believe. However it is not nearly as good as Creepshow, which debuted about five years earlier,but from which it definitely got it inspiration. The first story is just,to me,plain creepy. Not scary creepy, but in bad taste creepy,as it deals with Necrophilia. Not something I want to see on the screen,thank you very much. The other stories manage to keep your interest,but the film does wear out its welcome, coming in at about 100 minutes long. 2 1/2-3 stars.
The second film is Theatre of Blood and it stars a bevy of long standing British actors,along with Price as the lead. The story finds Price as a well known but less than loved(by the critics) Shakespearean actor. He is passed up for the 1972 Critics Choice awards for a newcomer and goes ""off the rails"".He confronts them in an after-ceremony get together. When his daughter arrives(Diana Riggs)and asks her father to stop he falls completely apart and walks outside to the balcony and starts quoting the bard right up until he jumps off and into the Thames river. He is later found by a scruffy lot of vagabonds and brought back to health. He now lives in an abandoned theatre giving Shakespearean performances every night. But he also is now plotting his revenge on the circle of critics that drove him to this point,along with the help of his daughter. Between the two they start killing each one,all by the plot of a particular Shakespeare play,such as Titus Andronicus,Richard the Third,King Lear,etc. In the end the police finally catch up to Price and his daughter in the old theatre, which they now have deliberately set on fire. Price and daughter end up falling from the roof into the interior of the flaming building. The last critic,now freed,still thinks Price over acted his final ""role"".
This film is helped along wonderfully by  the great British cast and Riggs is surprisingly good in her role as Price's daughter. And Price is absolutely brilliant as the Shakespeare-quoting actor gone ""off"".No one could have played this part better than he. 4 solid stars.
Technically speaking both films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 for ""Whisper"" and 1:66:1 for ""Theatre"".""Whisper"" is crisp but a tad grainy throughout,while ""Theatre""is nicely clear and crisp. Let me repeat,there is only one disc for both films and both are w/s,something the blurb for this product is in error of and/or just does not say.
All in all a cheap way to get both films. Theatre of Blood is the best of the two. Price shines. While From a Whisper to a Scream is not as bad as some say,it goes on far too long;they could have easily cut the first story,due to its subject matter,with no harm to the film at all. Price is relegated just to the relater of the stories, but still is a pro and does his job well.",1448150400,12,6966,4.613215149073328
