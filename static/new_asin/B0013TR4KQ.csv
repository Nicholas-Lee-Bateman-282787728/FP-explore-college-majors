8252933,5,B0013TR4KQ,"Kit Carson is a fabulous character from western American History.  This PBS video won the Western Writers of America award as the best documentary for 2008.
Carson covered the west as a fur trapper, helped lead John C. Fremont on his explorations, was an Indian Agent and a military leader.  He could not read or write--but he spoke at dozen languages.
A great beliver in the Union and Abrahan Lincoln.  A man whom many fault for the Navajo roundup but history is showing that this action probably saved their future--most tribes either ceased to exist or spent their lives on reservations far removed from their homeland.
Carson is a key to understanding the west.  The book Blood and Thunder tells the whole story very well.  The Carson Home and Museum in Taos, NM is a great small museum.",1246320000,6,791,4.702898550724638
8252934,4,B0013TR4KQ,"This biographical review of Kit Carson was well done.  His life and experiences were so diverse that everything could not be addressed.  For example, it did not cover in any detail his command at Fort Garland, Colorado, or his role in the Battle of Valverde where he was in command of Union forces at Fort Craig, New Mexico Territory.  As a Civil War and Indian Wars amateur historian, I was particularly looking for these subjects.  In all, I'm glad I got it and will enjoy watching it again.",1246233600,,493,4.568181818181818
8252935,3,B0013TR4KQ,"Kit Carson:  fantastic hero or monumental villain?  The makers of this program seem content to depict him as worthy of fame through his incredible exploits as a mountain man, trapper, guide and Indian relations expert.  However, they seem even more determined to portray him as a cold-blooded Army General who should shoulder most of the blame for the horrific treatment of the Navajo peoples, most infamously in the forced resettlement to the Bosque Redondo.

I just finished reading Hampton Sides' excellent Carson biography, Blood and Thunder, and was excited to see that he was the 'expert' most interviewed on this program.  However, unlike Sides' balanced and vivid account, the presentation here gives scant attention to the larger sociopolitical forces and figures at work (i.e. Manifest Destiny, Polk, Benton, and Carleton), instead focusing on Carson as a kind of scapegoat for the outcome of US-Indian relations in the West.  It's a little cheap.  To me, this seems an unfair treatment that doesn't acknowledge that Carson was a human being, fiercely loyal to his superiors, and alive during a time when the desire for the West was at its peak.  As such, his role was more complex than is depicted here, which was disappointing considering the PBS source.  One wishes that Ken Burns had tackled Carson after his excellent treatment of Lewis and Clark.

On the plus side, we get some stunning photography of the Southwest, breathtaking in its vastness, especially the Canyon de Chelly.  The contributions of Hampton Sides are most welcome, and some touching interviews with contemporary Navajos round out this program, which nonetheless fills an important gap in the Carson videography.",1234915200,11,1696,5.198529411764706
