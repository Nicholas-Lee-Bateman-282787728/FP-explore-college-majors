1122781,1,7880713352,"I was surprised at the ending of this film that I didn't see the above caption at the beginning of the film. This movie to me was comparable to American television movies where something terrible happens to a family and how they cope with it. It was an Italian film, but on the whole it was of the same viewing quality as these movies, maybe a little less slick in appearance.

Also some of the scenes were so banal. Like just before the boy drowns a sense of danger is created by the girl on the moped kicking one of her friends on another moped, the close passing of a truck as the father drives to his patient etc. Or when the boys' casket is nailed shut and is screwed shut interchanged with images of the mourning father. How fat can you lay it on?

Especially the beginning of the movie is excruciating. A very one-dimensional portrait of the family, if they were black, they would be called the Huxtables. This is of course to offset the second part of the movie with the first. First routine and happiness, the second chaos and sadness.

The above are just some things I noticed about the movie which didn't make sense to me. I won't even go into the storyline which is rather unplausible at some points even though it is completely predictable. What bothers me most though is that all of this must have been done on purpose, but why? The end result is a bland film which may have been made with a lot of care, but just doesn't come across. This is the first movie I have seen by this director. I have heard that his other movies are better. I hope so, because this film hasn't made a great impression on me.",1141430400,5,1616,4.309210526315789
1122782,5,7880713352,"Italian director and actor Nanni Moretti delivers a deeply moving meditation on the nature of grief and loss with ""The Son's Room."" Moretti plays Giovanni, a respected psychoanalyst, who leads a normal and happy life with his wife Paola and their two teenage children. But when Andrea, their son, suddenly dies in a diving accident, the family is forced to deal with this tragedy as best they can. It would be easy for the film to become so depressing and sad as to be unwatchable, but somehow that does not happen. The characters are so well drawn that, while you feel all their heartbreak, you know they will stay together and eventually find a way to deal with this. This is a beautiful film. Highly recommended!",1091750400,3,715,4.682539682539683
1122783,5,7880713352,"Must say that I've been waiting for a film like this for a long time. Nothing fancy, just beautiful, elegant, and detailed. Most of the time I was not aware that I was watching a film. It was that real. The film may have a simple look, but the philosophy/attitude that helps the family to come through the crisis is not. The Buddhist ideas revealed in the film are not some new age bull but sincere and inspiring. And I find the ending extremely powerful yet soothing. This is a great film made by a filmmaker who knows the medium really, really well.",1088208000,4,551,4.359223300970874
1122784,4,7880713352,"The happiest possible family shrouded by the drowning of a beloved son. So, not even a psychoanalyst is able to extricate himself, let alone helping the other family members. Everything turned sour and was virtually up-side-down eversince. But if this drags on too long as they do, it would instead suggest that there are some intrinsic frailties in this family, at least frailties in their personalities, particuarly so when the family have enjoyed so many years of perfect happiness. Or is it the other way round, too much blessing is in fact a curse? Well, the generation which had gone through the war or some similar disasters seems, on the whole, to be doing better.
A nice movie to watch and the cast is perfect, great cimematography with a lot of foreign settings.  But the first part is of the movie is more appealing than the last bit though.",1087430400,,852,4.718120805369128
1122785,4,7880713352,"This is only the second Nanni Moretti film that I've seen, and although I know he's known for his comedies, this and CARO DIARIO (the other film I am familiar with) tackle pretty weighty topics of death and dying, how to live in the face of death, the value of work (especially, creative work) and, well, life itself (what does it all mean? how can we make it meaningful? all the big questions).
Unlike the largely autobiographical CARO DIARIO, THE SON'S ROOM is a work of fiction and therefore a little easier to deal with. It is, in fact, quite understated, as many other viewers have noted, but there are suggestions of the inner turbulence each character experiences in dealing with the sudden death of a beloved member of the family.  Each member of the immediate family has his or her moment of breakdown or dysfunction.  Yes, it's predictable enough that we KNOW they're going to get their act together somehow.  But it's just unpredictable enough that we don't know how or when or after how many setbacks.
Some have commented on the Italian ""feel"" of the movie, and that difference is certainly apparent when you compare it to an American film on a similar theme, such as ORDINARY PEOPLE, say, or more recently, IN THE BEDROOM (speaking of ""room"" movies).  Both American films are powerful, emotional tours de force.  Contrary to the cultural stereotype of some perhaps, THE SON'S ROOM, is somewhat reserved in its portrait of grief.  Not every scene builds to an emotional climax.  In fact, some minor storylines, like the fossil theft, are essentially dropped in light of the larger drama that overwhelms them.  In that, this film seems actually somewhat truer to life than its American ""counterparts"" (if that's what they are).
I found myself often agreeing with Darragh O'Donough's very qualified review posted above, even though his assessment of the film seems much harsher than my own.  To me, the film's strength lies, ultimately, in its understatement.  But I must admit, I will have to consider more, O'Donough's assertion that the theme of the film is more one of alienation than grief.  That's an interesting take, and it may just well be true.  Oddly enough, I'm not sure that that's the theme Moretti and team imagined they were addressing.  I'm also not sure how much that matters.
Either way, THE SON'S ROOM is one to see.",1065830400,12,2346,4.8059701492537314
1122786,5,7880713352,"This was one of the best movies I've seen lately but it is still just a typical Italian film.  Italians still know how to get your attention and hold it for the length of the film.  How to review it?  It is not easy.  Life of a middle class Italian family is interrupted by the death of a son.  How does it affect all of them?  They are all angry and feel somewhat responsible for that but they have to deal with the situation and help each other.  The rest of it you have to see for yourself.  There are some interesting twists and turns there.  All I can tell you that a combination of a very good acting, perfect cinematografy, music, scenes, the story, and etc. made it a very strong, memorable and powerful film.  I loved it and I am certain you would as well.",1059177600,2,765,4.142857142857143
1122787,4,7880713352,"The Son's Room by Italian director Nanni Moretti is a dark, simple yet complex  and highly intellectually and emotionally challenging film that explores an untimely death and the grieving period that follows.  Let us examine ''The Son's Room'' by exploring two themes 1.) THE DIRECTOR,  2.)THE FILM.
1. THE DIRECTOR:
I have always enjoyed Moretti's ability to capture the intricacies and absurdities of life in a distinctly Italian manner while keeping a contemporary and realistic approach on his country and culture of origin.  Most of his films take place in Rome yet we are not offered shots of the Colloseam, the Spanish Steps or the Vatican and none of the characters in his films are seen strolling on Piazza Navonna or any other Roman touristic landmark or hot-spot that appeal to an international movie-gowing audience.  In all of his films we are offered another perspective on life in the eternal city one that involve vespas, brand-name clothing, ''in-victa''backpacks, record-stores, fast-food chains, etc etc etc.
Moretti's films offer us a view of Italians in their every day lives, the male playboys, hopeless-romantics or buffoons and dark haired sultry and naive female love interests are either absent or relegated to an inferior role.
THE FILM:
The Son's Room offers an in-dept examination of the frustration and confusion that follows the tragic death of a familly member.  Families struck by such an unfortunate tragedy find themselves in an unenviable state of shock and are unwillingly condemed to replay the circumstances surrounding the person's death in their minds on a quasi constant basis.  Comming to grip with the reality that it is impossible to re-alterate the past consistutes the biggest step towards recovery from grief,  especially for those who have suffered through the death of a loved one who has passed away in a tragic and unexpected manner. Moretti excells at exploring this concept in this film.
A film that is definitely worth seeing and that should not be limited to an art-house crowd.",1050192000,3,2034,5.142424242424243
1122788,2,7880713352,"A naturalist Italian movie about the life of a psychologist and his family faced with trials and tribulations.
Any naturalist movie is heavily dependent on the attraction of its characters and the things they do. In this case, big zero. The father is a psychologist that is so incompetent that his patients again and again criticize him for his total incompetence, and we don't see him do actual work (although we do see the typical plethora of weird patients on the couch). Nanni Moretti's acting and directing is delightful but he has not given himself anything to do. The mother seems to do little else than advance the plot, and the daughter could be more interesting if she was fleshed out at all.
I could see the rating for this movie go down in my head as it went on, out of boredom. It's a good idea for a movie, Moretti is pleasant to watch, but he gets a zero for execution.",1049068800,,884,4.462962962962963
1122789,5,7880713352,"For those who have experienced the impact of an abrupt loss in the death of a loved one, this beautiful film offers solace, companionship, and meditation about the value of life.  The film has been so widely reviewed that the story is well known: a middle class Italian family - a psychotherapist father, a devoted mother, a teenage daughter and son - seem to have all the joy of the closely knit family of everyone's dreams.  A small kink of a minor crime by the son in this placcid life is dealt with and yet is compounded by an accidental drowning of the son.  The effect this loss has on the family, especially the father, is at once devastating but has healing resolutions.  The son's girlfriend gains entry into this grieving family and together they find the journey to recovery.  Many lessons here: how does a successful therapist cope with his own personal loss?  how does a broken family unit re-enter life? how does an unknown but extended part of the family make an impact on this grieving and become part of the healing?  All of this is told in the simplest way, photographed beautifully, and acted superbly.  A gentle and lovely film for thoughts long after the screen credits fade.",1034985600,16,1196,4.6350710900473935
1122790,1,7880713352,"Ideal couple lost one of their two kids -- their son. That is all of the story; all other details (tiny crime act of their son at the beginning, father's feeling of guilt...) have the only function to prove that we are looking at the ideal family.
Death of a child IS tragedy!!! And it carries very intimate moments of pain so questions is should those moments be exposed without any other reason but to touch human heart even in such form as movie is.
The other very important fact is that death of a child (UNFORTUNATELY) is not very rare and thousands of such movies, based on the true stories, could be made every year -- the most of them even more tragic -- just ask yourself how many children can afford diving equipment and how many children died of bombs and bullets, how many children died because of lack of food or medicine...
At the end of the movie family refinds its lost idealness by driving to the other country (is the reason important?). Is there message: if you have lost your child but do not have car or you can not afford to drive to the other country...?
This movie seems to be almost mocking to the most of the parents who lost their children. Is it really so easy to hide wood behind one tree???

7900148,5,7880713352,"The acting in this movie was honest and the emotions acutely painful, especially the mother's role. She portrayed the agony a mother goes through when losing a child exactly the way it is all the way to trying to stay connected to the deceased child by contacting friends to hold on to that last shred of her child's being.  I know.  I went through this myself.  Well done and heartbrokenly sad, but honest to the end.",1476835200,,418,4.473684210526316
7900149,2,7880713352,I'm a big fan of Laura Morante and this wasn't her best work. The film was lacking in depth and character development and ended without any real conclusion. The movie just kind of dragged. I was tempted to turn it off 3 times. I wouldn't recommend this at all.,1425859200,,260,4.326530612244898
7900150,4,7880713352,"(Italian with subtitles) Like the American film ""In the Bedroom,"" this film is about a family who loses a son and their reaction to that event.  There the similarities end.  This Italian family is a very pleasant group to be with as they cook, eat, go for a run, attend the daughter's basketball games.  It is interesting to observe the father's patience in practicing his sometimes boring, sometimes dangerous profession of psychiatry.  The family experiences the normal experiences of grief: questioning, denial, regret, and anger when they lose their son; but they find a way to get outside themselves and get on with their lives.",1380499200,2,633,5.0
7900151,2,7880713352,"I am not sure why this film had such a negative effect on me.  Obviously it tries really, really hard to present a sensitive picture of a family dealing with the sudden death of a teenage son.

Maybe it's a cultural thing.  Maybe Italians show their feelings more than the Scandinavian-Americans I grew up with.  I lost a sister in childhood and I certainly appreciate the devastation such an event has on the whole family so I am not unsympathetic to the feelings of any such family.  I think it's really the fault of the film maker. For the bulk of the film he shows us scene after scene of the family members breaking up in grief. Artistically it just doesn't work to build sympathy; it is so overdone that it turn the viewer off.

In my experience life goes on, there are happy moments mixed up with sad ones and then there is the ongoing process of taking care of daily life.  This family is well off so the mother can afford to take time off of her glamorous publishing job until she feels like returning and the father, a psychiatrist, decides to quit his work altogether.  When a girl the son once met shows up they take her and her new boyfriend to the border of France to give them a lift  That is actually the best part of the film, but it does make less wealthy viewers who have to get up and go to work even in the midest of their grief a little unsympathic to this family.

There are numerous shots of the psychiatrist at work with a variety of patients, who lie on his couch.  They all seem to be types, none of them elicits any genuine sympathy from the viewer.  When one guy goes bezerk and throws the furniture around in a moment of supposed great sorrow, all I could do was laugh.

The effect of the death of a child on a family is certainly a worthy subject for a film. This film tried hard but ultimately didn't do the subject justice.",1351900800,,1856,4.268571428571429
7900152,2,7880713352,"I wanted to like this film as it had many components I usually enjoy.  It began with promise, but became disjointed and dragged on and on.  Sure, I understand what was going on.  But it became annoyingly slow and lost continuity.  Great cinematography.  This one really fizzled and disappointed me.",1323561600,,298,4.88
7900153,5,7880713352,"It is the movie `The son's room (= La Stanza Del Figlio) in 2001'. It was about a family. The peaceful family lost his precious son because of the accident suddenly. So, they experienced the sorrow and the movie showed how they overcame that period. It focused on his father's heart and feeling. It described his inner-world subtly. He was a tranquil, still, mild and gentle doctor of counseling. After that accident, his feeling became alive. So, he could not stand in the objective position.

The timing of that accident was Sunday. After the worship service at the church with his family, when he went to the patient's house for counseling, his son was died. So, he wanted to turn back at that moment and wondered if he didn't visit his patient's house. He regretted. I think his priority of life was the work. He thought that God was always there and his family was always there. So, he thought `what if I will go to work even on Sunday?'

There is the time for God. There is the time for family. Even on Sunday, it might be the accident. However, if after the worship service at the church and he took a rest with his family, he wouldn't feel guilty and regret so much.",1311897600,,1174,4.455813953488372
7900154,4,7880713352,"Nanni Moretti directs and stars in the 2001 Italian film ""The Son's Room.""  Moretti plays Giovanni, a successful psychoanalyst who has a seemingly idyllic family life.  His gorgeous wife works in the art world, his daughter is a bright student-athlete, his teenaged son often gives up time with friends in order to pal around with old dad, and the family sings along with the radio when they take weekend jaunts to enjoy the beautiful Italian scenery.  They're almost like an Italian Brady Bunch.  However, their happiness unravels when the family encounters a life-changing tragedy.

I had mixed feelings about ""The Son's Room.""  I definitely appreciated the realistic portrayal of a family facing a crisis.  In particular, the movie keeps histrionics to a minimal yet allows each character's grief to be fully explored.  Perhaps the most intriguing part of ""The Son's Room"" was the intertwining of Giovanni's work as a psychoanalyst and his difficulties working through his grief.  As he attempts to find some sense of meaning to the tragedy and a feeling of closure, his work with his clients suffers and he begins to experience counter-transference.  Some of these scenes are quite interesting and add something new to this genre.  On the other hand, the movie's odd tone kept the characters at a distance, making their reactions somewhat cryptic at times.  Moretti's acting was particularly off-putting to me; I'm not sure what he was going for during several scenes, but I had the impression that he simply is not a good enough actor to pull off this complicated role.

The film won the coveted Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival - the first Italian entry to do so since ""The Tree of Wooden Clogs"" (1978).  Notably, it beat out ""Mullholland Dr."" for the award, despite the popularity of David Lynch with the Cannes crowd.  ""The Son's Room"" is a solid, above-average family drama, although I thought it was a tad ordinary for a Palme d'Or winner (I would have voted for ""Mullholland Dr."" or even ""The Man Who Wasn't There"").  I'm glad I viewed the film, but it didn't make me want to seek out more of Moretti's work.",1253923200,,2125,4.861111111111111

7900156,3,7880713352,"The story of this movie is basically presented in snippets, small segments of places and events, some seemingly significant, and others questionable.  Chain linked together, the continuity of the story is thin in places; and this may have been done purposely to help convey a sense of disorientation and displacement that all too often accompanies tragic loss.  The effect, though, has a down side.  Though there are a few moments of powerful drama, the movie never pauses long enough to deeply engage us in the characters' struggle to survive their loss.  Our empathy, though at times, poignant, remains largely on the surface for most of the movie.  I rather liken it to visiting a national park, say the Grand Canyon, or Yosemite, but just driving through it, never stopping to get out and really take in the scenery.",1236297600,4,820,4.913043478260869

""The Son's Room"" is profound in its ability to create its moods especially in the latter half of the film. I feel that the director's presentation of this happy family, in the film's first half, is what allowed me to feel the result of an impending tragedy so personally. I kept thinking that I wanted everything to go back to the way it was before. I  shared their grief as if it was my own.

I also applaud the presentation of an Italian society which is unlike the comic opera Italian experience presented in American films over the past decades going back to the silent era.

The film may not affect you as deeply as it affected me, but I highly recommend the absorbing story that is presented.",1155168000,9,785,4.363013698630137
