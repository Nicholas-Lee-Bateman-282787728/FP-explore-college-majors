Guess Peter can't leave anything unchanged.",1451260800,,334,4.982142857142857

 As Warren says,
""It doesn't matter what your choice of snowriding equipment is, so forget the centruy's old term Skier and the decades old term Snowboarders, and just call us all SnowriderS!""

 Staggering beauty is abundant in this film and a couple scenes that are difficult to believe people would actually attempt and successfully pull off! Get Ready for some Great Action, and a darn good, rockin soundtrack to add to the mix!  ...THANKS WARREN!!!

 My Video Tape of this wore out so I sure was glad to see it here on DVD!

I recomend getting Freeriders, also by Warren Miller,  which in my opinion is the best video he has made.",949536000,4,275,4.288461538461538
