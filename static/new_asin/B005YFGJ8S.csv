4905902,4,B005YFGJ8S,"""Urbanized"" is the third film in Gary Hustwit's Design Trilogy, which examines the design behind things that we rely upon every day, beginning with ""Helvetica"" (2007), about one of the world's most ubiquitous fonts, followed by ""Objectified"" (2009), about the industrial design of everyday objects. ""Urbanized"" looks at the issues that modern urban design must meet in our increasingly populated cities. Urban design is such a complex subject that an 85-minute film can hardly do it justice, so ""Urbanized"" offers an overview of the challenges and innovative solutions facing the world's cities, whose population is expected to increase by 50% in the next 40 years.

At the beginning of the 20th century, 10% of the world's population lived in cities. At the end of the 20th century, 50% did. In 40 years, it is expected to be 75%. The pace of urbanization has been such that one-third of new urban dwellers live in slums without basic amenities. This clearly presents huge challenges for urban designers, strains resources, and strains people's ability to adapt. ""Cities are always the physical manifestations of the big forces at play: economic forces, social forces, environmental forces,"" as the film says. Urban design is also unique in that it is collaborative, an ongoing project in which architects, developers, government agencies, the public, and various interest groups work with and against each other to create the world in which we live.

""Urbanized"" speaks with architects and urban designers on five continents, as it explores issues of housing, transportation, energy consumption, and popular opposition to building projects. Any one of these topics would require its own film to impart an understanding of the issues involved and to look at successful solutions. ""Urbanized"" introduces us to these subjects but covers some issues better than others. A tour of Bogat, Columbia's transportation solutions with former mayor Enrique Pealosa is fascinating, while the film barely touches on energy and sanitation innovation. I didn't enjoy ""Urbanized"" as much as ""Helvetica"", partly because a documentary about one font has enough time to really cover the subject, whereas ""Urbanized"" is cursory, but it is thought-provoking.",1331683200,5,2238,5.373219373219373

4905921,5,B005YFGJ8S,"Bought this for my son.  If you are in the mood for a documentary, it's a good one he said.  He really enjoyed it.  His favorite segment was about a mayor in South America.  It was entertaining and enlightening.  Topics include safety, transportation, housing etc. but not education.",1383868800,4,283,4.8125

4905929,5,B005YFGJ8S,"As a huge Architecture and Design, and Film buff,the pairing of these two together is a great little film to watch. If you have designer furniture,or goods, then the whole series of these films are fantastic. Nothing better than sitting in a Le Corbusier chaise,having a nice cold frosty beverage, and kicking back to watch an interesting flick on urban design. highly recommended, very enjoyable and insightful. cant ask for more than that.",1355529600,,441,5.054794520547945
4905930,5,B005YFGJ8S,"In 2008, for the first time, more than half of humanity lived in Urban environments.
And by 2030, more than 60 percent will (almost 90% in North America), and more than 75% of economic activity will be from Cities.

This documentary shows the ultimate design challenge - the Design and Planning of Modern Cities.  Design beyond the aesthetics and how it influences our daily lives.  A must-see!",1352073600,,394,4.850746268656716
4905931,3,B005YFGJ8S,"Urbanized, like Objectified (Hustwit's previous film), is an interesting but diffuse film that takes on too much and fails to communicate a clear message. Maybe Hustwit wants this to be an incomplete conversation starter, but his talent for capturing and arranging fascinating material should be put to better use. Neither film approaches the simple beauty of Helvetica, in which Hustwit addresses a clearly defined topic deftly and succinctly.

I would rather have learned well the complexities facing Detroit OR Rio de Janeiro OR Beijing OR Johannesburg. The film's closing sequence about conflict over a massive redevelopment project in Stuttgart exemplifies the problems Hustwit creates. The footage and interviews are inconclusive, and the final moments about the segment are overlaid with a few lines of type that appear to explain what happened, but those lines actually leave questions just as large as those they answer. The topic simply isn't adequately addressed, and it's unclear what Hustwit meant we should take away from this portion of the film.

Hustwit's general topic seems to have been the difficulty of urban design and the necessity of including the needs of ordinary people in it. But by creating a summary view from 30,000 feet, Hustwit makes it difficult to follow his argument. The film is exquisitely shot and artfully edited, the sound design is right on for a breezy documentary, but Hustwit could have done so much better with the material by focusing on one city. He could have taught much more about urban design with one city as he did about typefaces with Helvetica.",1341100800,8,1600,5.15

8489260,5,B005YFGJ8S,"I show this film to my Urban Geography students every semester.  It is always relevant, despite its production date, and sets a great tone for the class.  It is very well know, the professionals interviewed are the best in the business and the ideas they present from around the world are innovative, and some of them are troubling.
