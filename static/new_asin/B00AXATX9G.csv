8558809,5,B00AXATX9G,"I recently purchased this from a thrift shop, and went to Amazon to see if there were other installments for this 'dvd collection'.  This is excellent!  It goes over different techniques for cutting, stitching, borders, colors, painting - and even a quick section on thread tension on your machine!  I am keeping my copy, and will view it occasionally to try something new.  HIGHLY recommend if you are the least bit interested in doing a quilt project of any kind.  The thread tension tip section is worth it ALONE if you sew anything.  Nicely done!  It comes with PDF instruction files for three quilts - baby, twin, and queen size.  Every seamstress needs this one.",1459555200,,668,4.747826086956522
