8313632,4,B001JQTSFM,"I was a big-budget blockbuster guy! Sure I liked smaller art and foreign films that obciously cost less. It probably wasn't until I got into the Andy Sidaris chicks-with-guns series that I appreciated the ""lower-class"" enjoyability of lower or micro-budget flicks. Horror came next, like Aunt Rose or Necropolis Awakened. Picked ""Last Chance"" up because of the cover, it conveyed suspense and at a glance you couldn't tell who was the victim.

Instantly you know it's low budget, and if slick million dollar production is all you want, pass this up. Remember, the filmmakers with $200 million to spend can blow it and churn out a stinker very fast! The opening credits were crazy-groovie! I loved the opening scene of the first assassination attempt, though I wouldn't give myself away by shining the laser-site yards ahead of me, or push open a door without expecting someone behind it. Kristof Robinson enters and is an obvious hunk hero even though he's working for a nut job baddie. His little buddie Holsten is a cute deadly character, would be nice to see another movie with him in it.

Okay the rest of the plot, killers goes to his assigned job, meets a girl while waiting, we sense it's not just any girl, into the picture comes the old man he's assigned to assassinate and the tables get turned, somewhat. Ben Lawton was good and a little funny as the Old Man. It's him and Kristof's show for the most part. Some nice martial arts fighting, no wires, no cgi and no Van Damme so it's all a bit tamer than we're used to. During the ""obligatory montage scene"" I was picturing Anthony Hopkins and Jake Gyllenhaal bonding in the big budget version!

I think the filmmaker Benjamin Todd was really gung-ho into getting this movie done right and it shows. His star Kristof Robinson is quite entertaining and seeing his ad-libs and beat boxes in the extra features shows he's got some improv comical talents as well.

I'd like to see more work from Kristof and all the guys and girls in this movie team!",1305072000,2,2005,4.671388101983003
