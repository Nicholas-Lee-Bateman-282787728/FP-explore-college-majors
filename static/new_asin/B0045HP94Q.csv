It is not just flashes of midriffs like the prior reviewer states. It does that in some areas, but it doesn't effect the viewing quality and it doesn't continue throughout. Some videos make you dizzy just trying to watch because of all the camera shots going in and out, but this one is not like that. It has a lot of performances on it and the music is great. I don't just pull out all my other performance vids, but this one I do. It is one of my favs. I love the drum solo performance at the end, it is phenomenal. Tamra-Henna's ""ya amar"" is awesome and I really like Stevie's ""fairouz medley."" Sonia has two great performances as well. After watching, the music really stuck with me and I use them in my dance repetoire all the time. My fav's are ya helwa and fairouz medley, but honestly, every song and performance on this dvd is great. There is a group performance on it as well that is also nice--incorporates wings. Overall, great performance dvd with great music!",1309910400,3,1151,4.383177570093458
8416720,1,B0045HP94Q,"This is THE worst dvd ive ever purchased,As a dancer i want to watch an actual dance being performed,what you get is close ups of faces,midriffs,and only quick flashes of a full length figure. The screen flashes images of the dancer in constantly changing costumes in rapid succession,it makes you feel very nauseous like travel sickness and if you had epilepsy im sure the frantic flashing changes would trigger an attack as it IS that bad. What could have been a gooddvd is totally ruined,i don't know what they were thinking,i definately don't recomend it.",1300665600,4,559,4.894736842105263
