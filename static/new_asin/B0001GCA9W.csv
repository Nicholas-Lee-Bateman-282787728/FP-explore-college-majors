8012031,3,B0001GCA9W,"Yes, this dvd has no menu or chapters, yes it's short. But it does have good quality footage of some very good performances including Sara Hughes' complete short and long program from 2002. If you know what you're doing you can split the video yourself; I was able to do it with Magic dvd copier and Handbrake. Considering that this video is currently going for under ten dollars, I think it's worth it.",1338422400,2,403,4.534246575342466
8012032,1,B0001GCA9W,"Both volumes 1 and 2 are a major ripoff. There is less than one hour of film on each DVD, which could hold 6 hours or more. The clips are short and only show part of the performances. Most of the DFD is blather from the commentators. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Where is Sasha Cohen, the greatest skater who ever lived?",1243814400,25,329,4.15625
