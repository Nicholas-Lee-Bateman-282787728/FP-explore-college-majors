I just wish that today's sitcoms were filled with the kind of wholesome laughs that Who's the Boss provided. Unfortunately, today's sitcoms lack story lines, are full of innuendo and are cancelled because they don't carry the same weight that old time sitcoms did.",1091059200,5,360,4.73015873015873
2044785,5,B0001Z3I1C,"This show, Who's the Boss?, is the classic of all sitcoms! It was in some ways like a soap opera, it kept you watching week after week to see Angela and Tony finally make a try at it together as a couple. Judith Light had plenty experience as an actress in a soap opera, previous to landing the role on this sitcom. Tony Danza, formerly of Taxi, does an excellent job of portraying Tony Micelli on this classic sitcom. Danza was and is still a hunk and was one of the main reasons that I watched the show every week. 1980's classic comedy that goes above and beyond typical sitcoms in that it was a long running show.",1089590400,2,617,4.237288135593221

2044787,4,B0001Z3I1C,"Some people may consider Who's the Boss to be somewhat of a cheesy situation comedy, and maybe it is.  But I always found it funny and it is one of the few sit coms I would ever actually sit down to watch.  And it's probably the only sit com I ever felt sad to see end.
Who's the Boss ended the same year The Cosby Show did and I recall several commentaries that denigrated the show in comparison because it had no lasting social value.  Even though that may be true, who watches situation comedies for their lasting social values?  And name any situation comedy that strives for such a lofty aim?  The bottom line is it's an entertaining and funny show and in that regard it succeeds.
Unfortunately, my version of the DVDs has poor sound quality and a lot of times the voices don't match with the actors and I have to stop and replay the DVD to get them to match up.  I'm not sure if that is just the DVDs I received or if it's a manufacturing flaw in all of them.",1087344000,29,965,4.161290322580645

I was an 80s kid & 90s teen, and have many favorites from that nostalgic era of my childhood & adolescence!). I really wish/hope that Columbia-Tristar Home Entertainment (or whichever studio that owns this show) would just release the remaining SEVEN seasons of this beloved hit sitcom. Especially being that 2017 marks the 25th anniversary of its series finale, it would be great if the studio took advantage of that opportunity to release and sell a 25th Anniversary Edition for old fans and potential new fans alike. Because whether they release this show to DVD/Blu-ray themselves, or whether they sell the rights for this show to another company (like Shout! Factory, or Mill Creek) more open to bringing the rest of this show to DVD/Blu-ray, there  are MANY, MANY people who want to buy the rest of the seasons and complete the series or are waiting for a full series set to be released before buying (instead of getting individual season sets). So rather than just sitting on this GEM of a show, and not making ANY profit on DVD of the remaining seasons (or complete series set) if they are so concerned about the sales of this show, they could release it as a ""Manufacture on Demand"" or ""limited release"". That way they could avoid/reduce the costs from the mass production of DVDs for a show that may not sell as much as they want, while yet still making it available to those of us who DO want it, and have been waiting for YEARS to have the rest of this WONDERFUL series in our collection!

""Who's the Boss?"" is a wholesome 80's sitcom about Tony Micelli (played by Tony Danza) a widowed former professional baseball player & single father who is struggling to raise his preteen daughter, Samantha (played by Alyssa Milano) in a tough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. In the hopes of giving his daughter a better life, Tony wants to leave Brooklyn and move to a nicer area. As luck would have it, he meets Mona Robinson (played by Katherine Helmond) who offers him a job as a live-in housekeeper for her daughter, Angela Bower (played by Judith Light) an advertising executive separated from her husband, Michael, and struggling to raise her young son, Jonathan (played by Danny Pintauro) as a single mother in upscale Fairfield, Connecticut. So Tony and Samantha move in, and quickly develop a tight-knit family with Angela, Jonathan, and the sexy & randy, wisecracking Mona.

From the ""blurb"" on the back of this DVD set:

Father Doesn't Always Know Best!
Tony Danza, Judith Light, Katherine Helmond, Alyssa Milano, and Danny Pintauro comprise one of the funniest dysfunctional families on TV in the complete 22-episode WHO'S THE BOSS first season collection.
The adage that father knows best is taken to task in this hilarious comedy series that launched network ratings into the stratosphere!
Tony Micelli (Danza) is a former professional baseball player, who along with his preteen daughter (Milano) moves into advertising executive Angela Bower's (Light) house to be both housekeeper and father figure to Angela's young son (Pintauro). But Tony and Angela soon discover their chemistry collides with their professional relationship, further complicated by well-timed, biting commentary from Angela's eccentric mom (Helmond)

While, for the most part, the above blurb is SPOT ON, I disagree wholeheartedly with its claim that the family on this show are a ""dysfunctional family"" -- and would really like to know, by what criteria that those who wrote the blurb on the back of this DVD set, deem the Micelli/Bower family as ""dysfunctional"". There is no alcoholism (or other substance abuse), no co-dependency or other issues, no domestic violence and in fact, rarely any heated/volatile arguments, basically, NOTHING to signify ANY dysfunction. In fact, to the contrary, because the Micelli/Bower family always sticks together, and helps each other through thick & thin, good times and bad, UNLIKE many other families (whether in real-life, or on TV), in my opinion, the Bowers & Micellis are FAR MORE of a functional family (despite the characters not necessarily being biologically related -- like Angela and Mona, being unrelated to Samantha or Tony being unrelated to Jonathan) than those who are CONSIDERED ""functional"" families, but are actually ANYTHING BUT!!

For example, in one episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-s-the-Boss/dp/B0001Z3I1C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who's the Boss?</a>, Mona has to move in with Angela & Jonathan (and Tony & Samantha) and as she's doing so, both she and Angela simultaneously say: ""It's only temporary"" to which Tony replies, ""Hey! What is this temporary stuff? You're family! You need a place to stay, you stay as long as you want!""....................................compare/contrast that with Cliff & Clair Huxtable from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cosby-Show/dp/B00ZGRMTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cosby Show</a>&nbsp;who APPEAR to be a loving ""functional"" family but in reality are emotionally/psychologically/mentally controlling & abusive, not only making cruel comments/jokes about their adult children having to move back in/live with them from time to time, but worse (if that weren't bad enough) constantly denigrating & disparaging their young children, telling them to get out and get a job (when they are still too young to work), saying that they have NOTHING, and even humiliating them in front of their friends. Yet, incredibly its Cliff and Clair Huxtable who are the ones frequently (if not always) chosen as the Top TV Dad and TV Mom, while Tony Micelli, and Angela Bower (who, in my opinion, deserve that distinction far more!) are often ranked farther down in the list, or even left off completely. Seriously, I think whoever wrote the blurb on the back of this DVD set, has their head(s) firmly entrenched so far up their a$$e$ that they can actually see the end of their tongue!

I honestly don't know how they can call the Bowers/Micelli family dysfunctional, when this family is so supportive of each other, and whatever problems they face (whether Tony struggling to pay the rent on his deceased father's Brooklyn apartment, keeping it as a shrine because of an inability to grieve & ""let go"", OR whether Tony & Angela getting caught in a compromising position, or whatever else) they work through everything together (sounds like a pretty functional family to me!). Despite the very human flaws & failings of the characters, the family on this show helps each other WITHOUT all the hurtful ""put-downs"" of the Huxtables (of ""The Cosby Show""), and particularly Cliff & Clair, who in my opinion are extremely disrespectful & dictatorial towards their kids, and are totally dysfunctional -- FAR MORE than the family on this show!!!!

""Who's the Boss?"" is a GREAT family comedy suitable for nearly all ages. I say ""nearly all ages"" because there's a lot of romance-related storylines, sexual tension and/or innuendoes in many of the episodes (for example, the ""Pilot"" episode deals with whether or not Angela should go on a romantic get-away weekend & sleep with her boss just to get a promotion). However, speaking as someone who watched this show BOTH as a young(er) kid AND now as an adult, I just have to say that, especially in the early years, most, if not ALL of the sexual jokes/innuendo/storylines went right over my head. Although the friendship/relationship between Tony & Angela is very entertaining (as is pretty much ALL the relationships on this show) and at least some (if not most) of that has to do with the sexual tension & chemistry between them, in all honesty, as a kid, none of that really mattered or even occurred to me. I just thought they were good friends and that's it. I never ""got""/understood the sexual tension, jokes, and plot lines until I was older. For example in the episode ""Eye on Angela"" when Tony and Angela get caught in bed together, I didn't get what the big deal was because I didn't recognize the sexual innuendo -- and I just thought Tony & Angela were platonically co-sleeping (which essentially they were).

Besides, at that age, I watched it mainly for the platonic storylines involving the kids Samantha (Milano) and Jonathan (Pintauro) including their respective father-figure & mother-figure relationships with Tony & Angela and ""sibling"" type relationships with each other. I LOVE(D) the dynamic between Angela and Samantha, and Mona & Samantha, particularly in the episodes ""Samantha's Growing Up"", ""Double Date"" and ""Eye on Angela"". Its so touching, especially since Samantha's mother had passed away before the start of this series, how Angela (and Mona) both take Samantha under their wing, like a surrogate daughter and grand-daughter. I also love the dynamic between Tony and Jonathan as well as the relationship between Tony and Mona, and to a lesser degree Mona and Angela (I don't really like the way Mona is always making snide & sarcastic remarks/criticism of Angela -- kind of reminds me of Cliff & Clair Huxtable of ""The Cosby Show"" though in my opinion, they are a million times worse, because they insult, humiliate and put down their YOUNG children, not just a successful grown woman like Angela)

In fact, my favorite episodes, have little to nothing to do with sex or the romantic tension between Tony & Angela. For example, in this season, my favorite episode is the episode ""Samantha's Growing Up"", in which Tony objects to Angela & Mona helping his tomboy preteen daughter Samantha to take her first steps into womanhood by getting a bra. Other favorite episodes include ""Keeping Up With the Marcis"" in which Samantha wants to go on a school ski trip with her rich friend Marci, and Tony cannot afford the $250 fee and struggles to find a way to come up with the cash as well as the episode, ""Just Like Tony"" in which Angela worries that Tony's stories about his childhood hooliganism are rubbing off on Jonathan, and the episode, ""Angela's First Fight"", in which Angela objects to Samantha's rough-and-tumble, fist-fighting ways -- until she herself is backed into a corner. There are many other episodes, both in this season and other seasons that I love and have nothing to do with sex. Though the underlying sexual tension and/or innuendoes may be there -- like I said, most, if not all of it went right over my head when I was too young to get it, and since my parents (particularly my mom, a doctor) had been teaching us the basics of the ""birds & bees"" pretty much from the start (I remember when I was in preschool or kindergarten, my mom drawing me a picture of the female anatomy when I asked where babies came from) by the time I actually WAS old enough to ""get it"", I knew the ""facts of life"" anyway!

""Who's the Boss"" is is one of my all-time favorite shows (albeit of many favorites!). Unfortunately, they just don't make any shows like this anymore, and with a few exceptions, the majority of the stuff on TV today is PURE GARBAGE. Because UNLIKE the ""reality shows"" on TV these days (like ""Honey Boo Boo"", ""Duck Dynasty"" and ""The Kardashians"") shows like ""Who's the Boss?"", ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Mr. Belvedere"" promote/encourage good values, without preachy moralizing and still being entertaining and light. I LOVED watching this show as a kid/early teen (it went off the air when I was 13-14) and I'm really enjoying watching it again & again on this season DVD set, and what few episodes that I have been able to DVR from syndicated TV reruns. But I really wish that they would release the rest of this series to DVD. Not only have equivalent sitcoms like Full House, Growing Pains, and Family Ties have been released in their entirety, but its incredible that even UTTERLY TERRIBLE shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Mother-The-Car/dp/B00G5N6C8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Mother The Car</a>&nbsp;have been released to DVD in its entirety, while fans of ""Who's the Boss"" have been waiting nearly a dozen years, to no avail, for the remaining seasons to be released. It makes NO sense. Columbia/Tristar Home Entertainment has already made money from this show in syndication, and even if the sales of the 1st Season of this show was not as high/good as they wanted, it was at least SOMETHING, and something is better than the nothing they're getting by holding back the rest of the seasons!

Furthermore, since, to the best of my recollections, ""Who's the Boss?"" is NOT a music-heavy show (UNLIKE shows like ""The Wonder Years"" or ""Cold Case"") producing ""Who's the Boss?"" on DVD can NOT be as cost-prohibitive, as it is for shows that are heavily dependent on securing the music rights. Not to mention that, if even a music-heavy series like ""The Wonder Years"" can manage to secure the music rights (or use similar enough available & cheaper music) to be able to release the show to DVD, there is NO reason why a non-music-heavy show like ""Who's the Boss?"" cannot be released to DVD other than pure obscene greed. It could be released as a ""Manufacture on Demand"" set if they are so concerned about sales not meeting expectations. Or why not have a limited release (like on Kickstarter or something) based on prepaid orders, in which fans of the show pledge (and put down a deposit) upfront to buy a set of the remaining seasons (or a complete series set). Its really sad that those in charge of (and/or involved in) decisions about DVD releases, choose not to release this GREAT show -- prioritizing their greed & insatiable desire for excessive profit ABOVE the smaller profits but being able to give back & repay all the fans of this show, for their years/decades of support while it aired on ABC and then in syndication and this first season DVD set. It should not always be solely about the money but the happiness and valuable memories of the numerous fans who want this show on DVD to have & enjoy forever. Seriously, its not like ""Who's the Boss?"" has/uses a lot of copyrighted music that they'd need to secure the rights for -- and fans of this show have been waiting for OVER TWELVE YEARS................TWELVE YEARS!

I mean c'mon..there's some really BAD shows out there that nobody (or hardly anyone!) likes -- TOTAL FLOPS like ""My Mother, The Car"", that have been released to DVD in its entirety, yet GOOD shows like ""Who's the Boss?"", ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Mr. Belvedere"",""Boston Public"", ""Step by Step"", ""Strong Medicine"", ""The Division"", ""Any Day Now"", ""State of Grace"", and so many others are either never released on DVD/Blu-ray, or have been stalled for years & years after a couple/few season releases with the rest of the series left incomplete. If the studios who own the aforementioned series somehow reads this review, please consider either releasing these shows to DVD (or Blu-ray) yourself, OR just PLEASE sell the rights to these series to a lower-cost/budget company like Shout! Factory, or Mill Creek who will be more willing to release these nostalgic shows for those of us who want it and are willing to promise, or even prepay (or put a deposit) to buy the entire series. Because there are a LOT of fans (myself included) who are SICK & TIRED of waiting for greedy studio executives to release these shows to DVD and are  either just recording/DVR'ing it off TV (or other sources) or giving in and buying bootleg DVDs of these shows. So seriously, studios, GET WITH IT, and bring the rest of this series and other favorite shows to DVD!

""Who's the Boss?"" is a GREAT feel-good show with a lot of hilarious comedy as well as touching drama. I'm so disappointed that those in charge are refusing to release the rest of the seasons on DVD. But even though I am planning to buy a bootleg set in the near future, if whatever studio that owns the rights to this show decide to get off their greedy a$$e$ and release the remaining 7 seasons or the complete 8 season set I will absolutely be buying it. Because I  this show, and its definitely a keeper!!!

""Who's the Boss"" is one of those gems and it's an entertaining and wholesome family show with lots of heart. The middle aged me can finally appreciate what I didn't during it's original run. Everything about this show, from the characters, down to the setting of the country colonial they live in is just warm and comforting.

2044885,4,B0001Z3I1C,"I fell in love with Who's the Boss? in the early 2000s; I stopped watching as avidly since but have always considered WtB? my all-time favorite show. I was obviously out of the loop when Season 1 was released on DVD in 2004.

Having Season 1 on DVD is a real treat and step up from self-videotaped episodes, as I am able to watch uncut episodes (for example, I hadn't recalled ever seeing the scene in ""Angela's Ex, Part I"" in which Mona parades downstairs in a bikini) with a crisper picture than grainy YouTube uploads (which, I realize, are better than nothing). The DVDs sequence the episodes in the order that they were produced, rather than the order in which they were aired. (Refer to http://www.wtbr.com/episodes/)

The set made for breezy binge-watching but made me bemoan today's sitcoms for not being as sexy, smart, and sweet. The chemistry between Danza/Light is electric, Helmond is a scene-stealer, and Pintauro and Milano are clever and cute. I enjoyed the 1980s fashions -- I don't care if Danza poked fun at Light's costumes/hairdos during their 2004 reminiscences on The Tony Danza Show, as I've always loved Angela's wardrobe, with her power suits, stunning eveningwear, and more casual sweaters, button-downs, and trousers, accented with sweet hair ribbons and those endearing, ridiculously large tortoiseshell spectacles.

I have three complaints, hence the four-star rating:

1) The special features are merely highlight reels. Modern audiences are spoiled by series DVDs brimming with commentaries, blooper reels, deleted scenes, and behind-the-scenes featurettes. I realize that the WtB? cast/creative team are busy with current projects/their lives; I would be content with blooper reels (like the one from the wrap party included in the Entertainment Tonight WtB? special in 2000). But as others have noted, it would be ideal to have reminiscences with the cast today.

2) There was no option to select closed captioning in the menu, but on my laptop, I was able to toggle that feature.

3) Where are the remaining seasons??! I wish that Columbia/Tristar Home Entertainment planned to release the remaining SEVEN seasons of this beloved hit sitcom, especially because 2014 marked the 30th anniversary of its premiere, and 2017 marks the 25th anniversary of its series finale. It makes me sad that comparable (or lesser) quality sitcoms like Full House, Growing Pains, and Family Ties have been released in their entirety, but not WtB? The money has already been made in syndication; is the cost of producing the DVDs prohibitive?

There was once a petition via WtB? Resource on the now-defunct Petition Online that likely had a hand in Season 1's release, and fans can register to vote at TV Shows on DVD (http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/votingfaq.cfm) to lobby for the remaining seasons' release. (As of this writing, WtB? is 110th in rank.) I wonder if a Clearly Canadian revival-style campaign in which fans pledge up front for a full series set could work.",1436054400,,2984,5.114989733059549

The best part of this show was the cast, and the amazing leads Tony Danza and Judith Light, and their sweet authentic chemistry. A sweet and funny comedy classic! Please release more seasons!!",1285113600,,243,4.809523809523809
2045015,4,B0001Z3I1C,"I liked Tony Danza in ""TAXI,"" but he did seem a little underused. Even if you see the whole series, he doesn't really have a lot of episdoes that revolve around him. This was a nice show in that Tony has more freedom to act.

What makes this show interesting is that it is full of contradictions. We have a woman exectutive (Angela) who leaves her house and son in the trust of Tony. And while Tony supposedly just works there, it is really he who runs the house. We have Angela's son who is very proper and neat and we have Tony's daughter Samantha who is rather tomboyish. And to top it off, we have Angela's mother who is on the older side, but she acts convincingly like a teenage girl.

I think the biggest mistake on this dvd box is that they call this a dysfunctional family. I don't see how they can call it that. If anything, this family works through everything, helps each other, and operates very smoothly depsite the faults of the characters.

Most of the episodes are very good. My only real complaint, and why I am deducting one star is the horrible 2 part episdoe with Angela's x husband. He is a rotton, cruel, totally unlikable monster, and we spend an hour wishing Tony would simply pick him up and throw him out the door. (Something like what he does in ""Protecting the President."")

But that said, we get to see how they work through awkward moments like when Tony accidentally 'sees' Angela; even in the early 3rd episode, we see that there is more than a employer/employee relationship between Tony and Angela; we see how they handle true hurt and sadness when Angela's so called friend makes fun of Angela and walks out on Tony after 'using him;' we get to see how Angela tries to teach Samantha not to fight, but then Samantha catches Angela fighting; we get to see Tony and Angela faced with a moral choice vs money; we get to see Angela help Tony stop trying to hide his pain over his father's death; we see Tony help calm problems between Angela and Mona when Mona has to move in for a short while; we see poor Tony and Angela photographed in an awkward moment; we see Tony have to teach John not to imitate all the bad things he did as a child; we see Samantha struggle with having to be in a class where almost everyone is financially above her; and in the final episdoe, we see some tenderness between Tony and Angela. (Sounds like a very functional family to me.)

I'll finish with a real signature line from Tony. Mona had to move in for a short while at one point. Angela and Mona simultaneously say: ""It's only temporary."" And Tony comes out with: ""Hey! What is this temporary stuff? You're family! You need a place to stay, you stay as long as you want!""

I know many people are wanting more seasons. (Myself included.) But for now I guess one is better than none.",1284336000,3,2800,4.375

Judith Light stars as the conservative Angela Bower, to Tony Danza's ex-professional athlete housekeeper Tony Micelli. Fresh from Brooklyn, Tony and his adolescent daughter Sam (Alyssa Milano) quickly develop a tight-knit household with Angela, her six-year-old son Jonathan (Danny Pintauro) and sexy, wisecracking mother Mona Robinson (Katherine Helmond) who moves in with the family mid-season.

Memorable episodes include ""Briefless Encounter,"" when a newly-hired Tony accidentally barges into the bathroom on a bathing Angela; ""Samantha's Growing Up,"" where Mona and Angela help the young, embarrassed Sam on her journey into young womanhood; and the two-part ""Angela's Ex,"" where Mr. Bower returns and claims to want his family back.

2045025,5,B0001Z3I1C,"I greatly enjoy watching ""Who's the Boss!"" as it gives a ""good feeling"" to TV watching. The comedy is great - the characters believable, genuine, caring and funny. And there is even an underlying moral message beneath each episode, be it ever subtle - like honesty, integrity, sticking with each other. It's visible that the relationship between all the characters is genuine and caring. Tony is always upbeat and true. Mona is a card with an upbeat sense of humor who underneath it all is very caring of her daughter, Angela. Angela is more straight-laced, although funny at times too, however you need that to balance the whole mix of characters. And the kids are cute with their own innocent comedy. Sometimes while watching the show, I have to remind myself that it actually was filmed 2 decades ago because the stories can fit today as well. The show is an overall ""feel good"" type that leaves you talking about it and rehashing the funny stuff, long after you're done watching. I recommend it highly!",1214784000,4,1006,4.7542857142857144

Mona is very funny.  Katherine Helmond did a great job in this role.  Tony and Angela's relationship is interesting. They really dragged out the tension between these two for too many seasons and it would have been better if they got together earlier and just ended the show but it's a lot of fun to watch.

You would think by now... I'd be sick of ""Angela's First Fight"" or ""Sorority Sisters"" after over 50x, but, no -- that's got to be the sign of an awesome sitcom. My kids are nuts over Season One of Who's the Boss - I'm going to have to just tape the rest of it off tv. Doesn't look like this winner is every coming out. I've been waiting almost 5 years now. I really have to say, tho, I am surprised what a great sitcom it is. I never realized it had such awesome replay value, it's such a grinning, comforting show, morning before school, or nights before bed. Thanks Tony and Angela and Mona and Sam and Johnathan :) And fingers crossed for season 2 someday.

Even assuming season 1 didn't sell as well as they'd hoped, why couldn't they release the rest of the series as a limited edition on Amazon only or something rather than force people to buy homemade DVDs off of websites made by amateurs?

The comic relief comes from all the characters on this show that's why it worked so well.  Mona is especially funny as Angela's mom who has a very active social life.

2045049,5,B0001Z3I1C,"I have always loved Who's the Boss, and I love Tony Danza no matter what lots of other people say.  It's corny, hokey, very 80s, and everything I miss about TV sitcoms to this day.  Tony Micelli is my idea of a real man--ALL man, sports loving and rough around the edges, yet a downhome romantic who isn't afraid to take on nontraditional roles like being the housemaid to a single mother.  It's yuppie meets the Rockie of the baseball world to some extent, which leaves the show plenty of open doors for good comic plots.

Alyssa Milano is cute and funny as Tonys semi-sassy daughter Sam, but Danny Pintauro as Angela Bower's son Johnathan is just a bit stiff and annoying at times.  I love the difference between Judith Light's proper Angela and her mother, the wild swinger Mona played with great natural humor by the always likeable Catherine Helmond.  Without her presence, the show wouldn't work quite as well.  The chemistry between Tony and Angela is also as appealing as that of Fran and Max on The Nanny, so you may notice many similarities in the two shows, except the writing of the Nanny is sharper.

My favorite episode?  By far, Angela's First Fight.  I laughed so hard, never having seen it before, that I watched it over a few times.  I also love the theme song which was co-written by smooth jazz great Larry Carlton.  If you love corny sitcoms that bring back great memories without apologizing for it, get the first season of Who's the Boss.

Tony was hot back then, and all the characters had good lines and it wasn't over the top corny.  Angela's clothes and hair are the two things that most date the show, otherwise you'd think it was a more recent production.  Tony moves to Connecticut after his wife dies, so that his daughter Samantha can try to have a better life than what they had in Brooklyn.  Cut a long story short, he ends up being Angela Bower's housekeeper and they build a good report.  Angela's son Jonathon bonds well with Samantha and there is plenty of witty banter between Tony and Angela's mother, Mona.

It would only be a year after the demise of Taxi that he would be chosen to play Tony Micelli on the ABC sitcom,Who's The Boss?. Tony is a widowed father who moves with his young daughter Samantha(Alyssa Milano) to Connecticut from New York. He becomes the housekeeper for Angela Bower(Judith Light,late of the ABC daytime serial One Life To Live),an advertising executive who is a single parent as well,and her young son Jonathan(Danny Pintauro). Katherine Helmond,another ABC veteran who is late of Soap,is Mona,Angela's mother. The two families would blend into one without marriage(later in the series Tony proposed marriage to Angela but the wedding never happened). ABC aired this sitcom on Thursday nights from September 1984 to September 1992,just like NBC's The Cosby Show. ABC aired WTB for the very last time on September 10,1992 and NBC aired TCS for the very last time one week later. Both WTB and TCS premiered on September 20,1984. What an awesome coincidence,don't you think? WTB recently premiered on cable television's Nick At Nite. Here's an interesting fact:Danza's Taxi co-star Marilu Henner guest starred in one episode of WTB during the show's run.

2045100,5,B0001Z3I1C,"I am a big ""Who's the Boss"" fan. So when I heard they were producing the series on DVD, I had to rush out and purchase it. I wasn't disappointed. The series contains the full first season, and while I was somewhat surprised they didn't spend more time designing a more interesting interactive menu, the series gets full marks for being just as funny and cool as I remembered. The actors and actresses are very charming. Angela looks beautiful as always in those gorgeous costumes, and lets face it Tony Danza is a hunk! Five Stars",1091664000,6,530,4.53125

8018787,3,B0001Z3I1C,"Great show! I just wish the later seasons were available; it seems strange to release just the first season of a show, without the rest. My only complaint is that the picture isn't great on these DVDs. It's not terrible enough to bother me personally, but some people might object to the visual quality.

If you loved this show, aren't invested in the picture quality of the DVDs, and don't care that you won't be able to own the full series (just the first season), I'd definitely recommend this. If you're super picky about picture resolution, though, you might be disappointed. I would also point out that if you're not in a rush to own these DVDs, there's always the chance that the studio will decide to release the full series at a later date (as was done with ""the Nanny"").",1484697600,5,780,4.531914893617022
