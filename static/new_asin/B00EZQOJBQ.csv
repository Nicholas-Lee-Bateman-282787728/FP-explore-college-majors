5959539,5,B00EZQOJBQ,I don't know why it took me so long to find and watch this movie. I have been a fan of Rurouni Kenshin ever since I first watched it in Japan over 17 years ago. It was worth the wait though. The casting was perfect! All of the actors felt real to me and were the characters. The story was great and the music really fit the moments. I am anxiously awaiting the next two parts!,1403136000,3,376,3.960526315789474
5959540,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"Very close to the anime serie, the characters are greatly taken, and the scenarios and battles are exactly how they should to follow the story.",1402272000,2,143,4.76
5959571,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"Loved the anime when it first aired in the US. This live action version impressed me with the fight scenes, the drama, and the character portrayals. Takeru Satoh is perfect as Kenshin. You don't have to know the story or watch the show to enjoy the film; my parents loved it. It's worth buying the Blu Ray Steelbook edition for the cover.",1420588800,,338,4.467741935483871

5959577,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"The design of steel case (Jacket ) is better than Japanese one I think.  This is Simple and Cool , It 's good.
And one more reason I got this is English subtitles,  Japanese domestic disc does not have it ,
The story, casting , action, .. the contents , of course,  it is enough to enjoy about 2 hours !
Any way , I am satisfied !
Thank you .",1410480000,,342,3.788732394366197
5959578,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"Although it has some slight differences on the original anime series, it still is true to its plot. Well-acted and well-played. Great action scenes. I am waiting for the next installment in Blu ray. By the way, the UV digital download did not work because of region issues, which was a letdown.",1409961600,,294,4.673076923076923
5959579,5,B00EZQOJBQ,Great story line and lots of action. My friends who saw it also loved it. The casting was well done and the characters were great pretty much how I pictured the anime characters if they were real. If you like Kenshin then you have to see this movie,1407110400,2,248,4.1875

8610898,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"Awesome live action  of a classic and they fit and adjust the story well for a movie.

All the actors fit so well.

Great movie and the sequels are just as good. Get the trilogy.

No complaints on the blu Ray though my code for digital download is way expired when I got it.

So that is a bummer",1506211200,,295,3.9322033898305087
8610899,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"There is no bigger adaptation nightmare than taking an arc-driven, intricate story, and trying to whittle it down to a two-hour feature film. Exhibit A: ""The Last Airbender.""

But occasionally... very occasionally... someone gets it right. And in the case of the live-action ""Rurouni Kenshin"" movie, they got it brilliantly right -- while the first arc of the long-running manga/anime series is condensed down to a couple of hours, the director and writers knew exactly what to incorporate and what to leave out, giving us a lean yet spiritually faithful take on the wandering ex-assassin. This should be shown in classrooms as THE WAY to adapt a long-running series.

The story takes place in the Meiji period of Japanese history (the late 19th through early 20th century), when the emperor had newly opened Japan up to the outside world, and Western ideas, culture and clothing were being incorporated into Japan's way of life. The samurai and others who once lived by their swords now have to find a new way of life, such as Sait Hajime (Yosuke Eguchi), a former member of the Shinsengumi, who is now a police inspector.

Now a mysterious assailant is murdering police officers in Tokyo, calling himself ""Hitokiri Battosai"" (the name of a legendary assassin swordsman). At the same time, a young wanderer named Himura Kenshin (Takeru Satoh) comes into Tokyo, and immediately enmeshes himself with a fiery Kendo dojo owner, Kaoru (Emi Takei). It soon turns out that while Kenshin is polite and mild-mannered, he's also crazy talented with a sword and can effortlessly defeat a dozen assailants. Guess who he is.

But Kenshin's attempts to lead a peaceful, violence-free life are constantly disrupted, because the poor guy literally can't walk into a restaurant without being forced to fight someone. Not only is the bloodthirsty cop-killer -- whose actual name is Jin-e (Koji Kikkawa) -- trying to provoke Kenshin into fighting him by killing lots of people, but a mysterious young woman's presence pulls Kenshin into a conflict with a cruel opium-peddling businessman.

Strictly speaking, ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is not a straightforward adaptation of the original manga series -- rather, it takes different story threads and reweaves them together into a new form, so that disparate characters and adventures end up as parts of a cohesive whole. It's abundantly clear that this movie was made by people who loved the original story and wanted to do it justice, but they also cared about producing a movie that worked well on its own merits.

And director Keishi tomo captures everything beautifully -- he gives us glimpses of the growing pains and cultural shock that Japan is undergoing, where smartly-uniformed cops walk amongst people in centuries-old traditional garb, and the once-proud samurai are left penniless mercenaries. He also keeps the fight scenes lean, compact and acrobatically lightning-fast, with Kenshin spinning, lashing out and racing up walls to stymie his less skilled opponents.

But in keeping with the story's tone, there's also a fair amount of bloody death to show us the natural end of any sword-fight. For instance, one horrifying scene has Jin-e carving through the police station, leaving police officers impaled or bloodily struck down; elsewhere, Kenshin is motivated to action by the sight of a woman sobbing over her dead lover.

It also benefits from a magnificent cast -- Satoh is slender and pretty-faced, but has an air of weedy strength that makes it entirely plausible when he whips around with a reverse-bladed sword, kicking butt without actually killing people. And he embodies both of the character's personalities beautifully, being equally plausible as an earnest, awkward young wanderer and as a steel-sharp, grimly-determined ex-assassin. And yes, they found a semi-natural-looking shade of red for his hair.

Takei balances him nicely as Kaoru, giving her a youthful, idealistic naivete alongside her fiery determination, and Yu Aoi, Munetaka Aoki and Kikkawa all are excellent as a femme-fatale doctor, a raw rough street-fighter with a big weapon (literally) and a psychotic killer with creepy hypno-eyes. And Eguchi deserves special mention as Saito -- while the character doesn't do much just yet, he steals every scene with his steely-eyed, chain-smoking depiction of a hardened samurai-turned-cop.

Not only is ""Rurouni Kenshin"" is a superb adaptation, but it's a thoroughly entertaining historical-action movie -- lots of swords, blood, more than a hint of romance and the occasional ruined snack. Definitely worth your time!",1470009600,3,4582,5.247267759562842
8610900,5,B00EZQOJBQ,Super awesome.  If only they would make a steelbook with all three!,1436832000,,67,4.583333333333333
8610901,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"These live action videos are amazing!  They nailed it!  My family and I thought they were as good or better than the animated series.  The casting, the storyline (even the few changes), the actions scenes, the scenery ALL fantastic.",1428883200,,232,4.897435897435898
8610902,4,B00EZQOJBQ,"I was a little disappointed in the lack of a key (and my favorite) character from the anime in the Takeda mansion story arc.  Aoshii Shinamori, where have you gone???  But overall it was still entertaining, and many of the characters they did include were done really well, Sano, Saito, Jine, and most importantly Kenshin.  I would definitely watch it again.",1426032000,,358,4.836065573770492

8610905,5,B00EZQOJBQ,Love it!,1423958400,,8,3.5
8610906,5,B00EZQOJBQ,"Okay, So if you were looking for a faithful adaptation to one of the greatest manga/ anime stories of all time - You're not going to find it here. There are a couple of elements that are missing, and the UK- Subtitles were painful to me as they didn't go with the Media Blasters dub/ subs, and While I enjoyed Saitou's involvement in this story, I am vexed that he was brought in so early. But the action totally makes up for any misgivings I have. The Steel case is awesome, and I am so VERY happy it was available to me in the US, because while Warner Released it over seas We still have not gotten an official release and what I have seen of the bootleg is total rubbish.

i can't wait until parts 2 and 3 are given the same treatment!",1420848000,,738,4.125
