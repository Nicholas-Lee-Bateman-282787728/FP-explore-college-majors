858151,3,6304278691,"""The International"" is Tom Tykwer's follow-up to his very unconventional film ""Perfume,"" but his latest work is a rather conventional thriller starring Clive Owen as Louis Salinger, an Interpol agent trying to doggedly uncover dastardly deeds of one huge international bank. However, the film's immediate (and timely) subject matter of world-wide financing is just an excuse for a few action scenes and a cat-and-mouse game that goes on too long.

Thankfully, actions are more than satisfactory, but the film's intriguing premise is undermined by the convoluted story that gets more and more preposterous as it goes on. In ""The International"" a death in Berlin leads Clive Owen's determined protagonist, formerly working for Scotland Yard, to the conspiracy theory of the bank officials of a Luxemburg-based international bank. While he is supported by New York's assistant district attorney played by Naomi Watts, his investigation is often frustrated by authorities and powerful vested interest groups.

Despite its all-too-familiar plot device in thriller - assassins are hired and wires are tapped - ""The International"" has two merits. One is the locations (particularly a beautiful vista of Istanbul). The other is the action sequence set inside Guggenheim Museum (actually a replica built in Berlin).

Clive Owen's intense acting itself is not bad, but we are not convinced why he should go to the length of doing what he does (as one character in the film says, Interpol's job does not include investigating or arresting). Naomi Watts is less impressive than Owen not because of her acting skills but the underwritten role she plays. Certainly her character provides the cooler, more rational side of justice, which is, however, overshadowed by the effective (but loud) shoot-outs.

Considering the topic the film is dealing with, it is understandable that ""The International"" becomes at times slow and talky, but what it reveals after all, especially in the second half, is nothing new, except some lessons about the relation between power and money, or, banks and foreign countries. What you will remember after watching ""The International"" is not that part, not the problems of modern finance, but bullets and blood.",1238976000,,2226,5.333333333333333
858152,5,6304278691,"I also saw this movie and it was VERY GREAT!!! I must admit i am an avid fan of Clive Owen, but i also wouldn't lie if this or any other movie he was featured in was bad!  This movie is great and i intend to purchase it on blu ray as soon as it comes out. You won't waste your money on this film, beleive me, it deals with what is accuring now in our own country and the world!! I rate it FIVE STARS or better!!!!",1236729600,3,413,3.6931818181818183
858153,4,6304278691,"""The International"" is a socio-political thriller that seems very prescient coming at a time when so many banks are failing and the world seems even more of a precarious place than usual. This film about an investigation of a bank's shady dealings seems more and more like a possibility given that nowadays, legal business dealings might not afford as much of a profit.

The film stars Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, who play, respectively, an Interpol agent and a NY City Assistant DA, who are investigating the IBBC, an international bank suspected of being involved in illegal arms deals. The bank works quickly to silence any opposition or any employee who tries to inform of the bank's activities. Owen and Watts find themselves thwarted at every turn, until the likelihood of bringing the bank to justice becomes bleaker and bleaker.

Owen smolders as only he can as an angry, hard-nosed cop who dogged pursuit of the IBBC has already cost him his job as a cop with Scotland Yard, and one would imagine, a whole lot more. Watts maintains steadiness and aplomb as she puts her life and career in jeopardy to work with Owen. Fine supporting performance by Armin Mueller-Stahl as one of the bank's principals and Brian F. O'Byrne as The Consultant, the bank's assassin round out the film, which has a spectacular set-piece shootout at the Guggenheim Museum.

Fans looking for a constant rock 'em, sock 'em action thriller like the Bourne movies may be disappointed with The International, but it is a paranoid, sharply plotted film that has interesting characters and a great story.",1236384000,9,1582,4.895522388059701

858155,3,6304278691,"THE INTERNATIONAL is a film that wants to be two kinds of movies at once, and somewhat drops the ball on being either very effectively.

This tells the story of an effort by law enforcement officials to bring down The International Bank of Business & Commerce, the IBBC.  This bank, we're told right from the start, is  involved in weapons trading and many shady deals involving violent overthrows of governments and so forth.  They don't really make money off the arms dealing, they make money handling the debt of the newly emerging governments.  They are a ruthless bunch, operating like a shadowy intelligence agency...assassinating those who stand in the way, bribing others.  There is no way to bring them to justice, it would seem, because they have their fingers in every pie, and will kill anyone who might get in their way.

So first, THE INTERNATIONAL wants to be an ""intelligent"" thriller, with lots of suspense generated by the political and economic machinations of men in business suits talking in hushed tones.  We see the good guys and the bad guys both discussing with each other the ramifications of one course of action or another.  There is lots of globetrotting, with scenes in Luxembourg, France, Italy, the US & Turkey.  These scenes are only moderately interesting, because in the end, the schemes of the bank are only drawn out in the most simplistic terms (the movie wants us to FEEL that everything is richly detailed and complicated, but it really isn't).  AND, most importantly, the actions of the bank don't really feel entirely credible.  Not that a financial institution wouldn't align itself with some really bad guys...but the whole thing really just feels like a half-baked Roger Moore-era James Bond kind of plot.

The other half of the movie wants to be an action thriller of the BOURNE ilk.  But the action and gunplay and forensic police work is mostly quite staid and uninspired.  With one notable exception.  There is a fabulously elaborate, visceral and exciting gun battle set in the Guggenheim Museum in NYC.  Naturally, it relies on the old standby that all bad guys are terrible shots and good guys seldom miss...but it's a thrilling, old-fashioned sequence that makes the rest of the movie almost worthwhile.

Also worthwhile is the always solid presence of Clive Owen.  Here's a guy who can really act, when given the chance.  He can be charming, he can be soulless...but he's seldom boring (and he's always vaguely half-shaved...talk about swarthy).  Yet true stardom has eluded him, because the truly best material doesn't go his way...or when something flat-out brilliant like CHILDREN OF MEN lands on his lap, no one goes to see it.  Owen is the right man for THE INTERNATIONAL, though.  He's capable of handling the talky dialogue.  He seems vaguely impatient with all the chatter and politics, and just wants to get on with taking some people DOWN.  And when the action does kick in, he's not just an impervious gunslinger...we see real fear and real hurt.  We believe that he is a hero who COULD get killed.  He brings a humanity to the most ""Hollywood"" of scenes and he brings movie star glamour to the most mundane of scenes.  It's an interesting dichotomy.

Owen is the star of the film...no question.  He is in nearly every scene, and director Tom Tykwer likes to give us lots of close-ups.  But Owen is assisted by a sold supporting cast, including the always welcome Naomi Watts.  Her role is seriously underwritten and probably could have been handled by anyone...but it's nice to see her anyway.  The silky-voiced, menacing Armin Muehler-Stahl also shows up as one of the head honchos from the bank.  This guy has THAT character down pat, and he's also always welcome.

Tykwer can be a great director (RUN LOLA RUN is a propulsive film in the best possible way)...and the gunfight shows where his true talents lie.  He doesn't bring much zest to the talkier scenes, and I hope someone  notices this and gives him a more action-packed thriller to helm.

Overall, I enjoyed THE INTERNATIONAL, but for most of its 118 minutes, I was quite aware that what I was seeing was not going to leave much of an impression.  It's a solid but seldom exciting movie.  It wants to think it has captured the flavor of our times, but it isn't rooted enough in believability.  If you like Clive Owen, I'd say it's worth a look.  If you're not a particular fan...then there's very little reason to spend time on it.  It's a near miss.",1234569600,44,4478,4.7835723598435465
858156,1,6304278691,"I'm uncharacteristically at a loss for words. The only thing relevant I can think to say about The International is that I'm astounded by how mind-numbingly boring it was. And I'm a fair reviewer with a wide attention-span. As awesome of an actor as Clive Owen is, even he can't save this one. I literally couldn't believe how boring and uninteresting this piece of glossy espionage dreck was. I honestly and seriously believe I would have gotten more enjoyment and entertainment value from watching C-SPAN, if you can believe that. That's not a joke, either. I earnestly don't think I've ever seen a movie so utterly devoid of humor, fun or personality. Oh well, you know how they say that Friday the 13th is unlucky. Looks like that belief certainly proved to be true with me with this abjectly unenjoyable film. I'll chalk this one up to experience to never again believe that movie is going to be good based on its trailer. Please, I implore you to save your valuable money and go see something else. ANYTHING else. Honestly, I wanted The International to succeed. I want Clive Owen to succeed. I just want him to be in a better movie.",1234483200,5,1139,4.643564356435643
858157,2,6304278691,"Beginning like an episode of CSI, transitioning into the espionage action of 24, and closing like a Grand Theft Auto mission, The International doesn't fail to entertain - it just doesn't offer us anything we haven't seen before.  Clive Owen gets another chance at being Bond and admirably handles the weathered protagonist as well as a few intense action sequences, most notably the stunning Guggenheim shootout.  As with most modest thrillers, the hero only gets to be heroic for so long and then succumbs to the limitations of traditional nobility, adhering to what is acceptable conduct for the ""good guy"".  The International teases us with the possibilities of rebellion, but when it can't bring itself to follow through, the audience is left slightly betrayed knowing justice doesn't win to the degree that it could have.

Interpol agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) tirelessly strives to bring down the International Bank of Business and Credit, a ruthless corporation he knows is funding terrorism and war.  With the aid of Assistant DA Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts), Salinger uncovers the clues he needs to find a reliable informant, but as he draws closer to cornering his prey he witnesses firsthand the tragic collateral damage caused from confronting such a powerful juggernaut.  As the death toll rises, Salinger must determine the price he is willing to pay to continue in his chaotic mission of justice.

Back and forth between Germany, France, Italy, New York and more, The International treats audiences to action and intrigue in some amazing locales. The most impressive sequence takes place in the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, involving the most unlikely ambush, machinegun shootout and bloody getaway. The setup for location-hopping and international espionage makes this feel like James Bond, except there isn't quite enough action, the pacing is a little slow, and the first act is reminiscent of a CSI episode. That's not entirely a bad thing - although the film doesn't know what it wants to be, the constant chases, high-speed pursuits and thrill of the hunt is enough to keep things generally amusing.

Protocol, procedure and jurisdiction always get in the way of justice. No one can handle the truth because of the immense responsibilities; stepping out of the boundaries of the law is crucial to success, and no real solutions can ever change the overwhelming corruption that seizes each aspect of every government. This isn't a new premise for Hollywood, and The International isn't relying on huge twists or extreme creativity to separate it from the commonplace action films opening on a regular basis. Audiences aren't likely to get the resolution or confirmation they're looking for by the end of this confused thriller, but as far as anyone should be concerned, the inconclusive toxin results, edited police statements, cover-ups and assassinations are no match for Clive Owen's powerful stare. It's all he ever brings to a gun-toting engagement, and it usually suffices.

858158,5,6304278691,"This independent production showcases the beautiful Patricia Ford in several short video montages, each with a different theme.  She is mostly just striking poses in bathing suits, but at least two of the sequences are  stunningly artistic and would put any Playboy video to shame. She presents  herself as she sees herself - sexy, sincere, with a touch of innocence.  It  is refreshing to finally hear her voice as she describes her thoughts and  feelings about her career.  Most of her voice is voice-over.  That's fine,  but I wished that they just would have pointed the camera at her while she  talked.  At any rate, this video is a truly mesmerizing experience, and a  must for die-hard Patricia Ford fans.  It probably will become a  collector's item because it can be rather difficult to obtain.  Sometimes,  the video simply isn't available from the distributor.  If this happens to  you, try the auctions.  It is well worth the effort to find this video.

There is nothing that will offend, but there is some artistic nudity  which is  done rather tastefully. However Mrs Ford does nothing for herself  but strike poses and as such the overall presentation of a supermodel could  benefit much from a more mature presentation. Her voice comes across like  one of those actors who lost their careers when sound came in and basically  that doesn't help either. Her stunning beauty aside, this tape doesn't  reach the professional status of any of the Playboy videos and therefor  should be seen as for Patricia Ford fans only.",933292800,6,722,4.813008130081301

Most of the cast is actually European, which I find a breath of fresh air to all the Die Hard sequels which always seem to be in Los Angeles. And of course, the film has become even more relevant with the global financial crisis of late 2008 early 2009, which the filmmakers could not have foreseen. Unless they're psychics. The central plot concerns the international financial system and how these large conglomerates make deals that may influence national defense systems, political movements, and even revolutionary coups. Not bad for a day's work at the office.

Clive Owen is convincing in his role as Louis Salinger, a disillusioned former investigator for Scotland Yard who has been probing an international banking/financial leviathan called IBBC for about as long as it takes to earn a medical degree. He has now joined Interpol to continue his international stake-out. Owen has uncovered evidence that IBBC has been playing brokerage firm for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of weaponry being sold to third-world-country revolutionaries, sort of Enron meets counter-insurgency. But every time he gets enough witnesses for his case, they end up snuffed out at the hands of an assassin whose personality would make Bill Gates seem more like Sean Connery. The film begins with one of Owen's colleagues at Interpol being assassinated right after a meeting with an IBBC informant who also dies shortly thereafter. Being an IBBC informant or being in the vicinity of an IBBC informant is rather bad for your health.

The game is on as Owen must become more creative to muster up evidence into the criminal workings of this international financial firm that would make Bank of America look like Toys R Us. And he must also keep his head above water as he follows strange leads and sift through conflicting evidence. And the chase moves from Germany to France to New York and somehow ends up in Turkey, living up to the title of this being a truly international movie. The only major American character is an agent, played by Naomi Watts in a performance that was satisfactory but not great.

This movie is good but has a few flaws. Some of the assassinations seem somewhat improbable, but of course the baddies never seem to be able to get Owen. Another shortcoming is that the film reveals the baddies of the story about midway through. I think I would have preferred if the entire experience was through the eyes of Owen as his investigation leads him inside the workings of IBBC. Once the viewpoint turned to the upper echelon of IBBC, they seemed less mysterious somehow.

Still, overall a good film, maybe not the best in the genre, but better than a lot of similar offerings in recent memory. And an outstanding performance by Owen keeps the pace constantly high. A few moments were highly suspenseful which I find much more satisfying than a lot of cars blowing up. The ending was a little sobering which I think was the point.

859600,3,6304278691,"On the surface we see some of the nuts and bolts of how countries are maneuvered into debt, as explained by one of the characters in this film, ""The IBBC is a bank. Their objective isn't to control the conflict, it's to control the debt that the conflict produces. You see, the real value of a conflict, the true value, is in the debt that it creates. You control the debt, you control everything. You find this upsetting, yes?  But this is the very essence of the banking industry, to make us all, whether we be nations or individuals, slaves to debt.""

But this film I think also offers a few clues to understanding how this pattern can be healed.

Clue one comes from this line from the film:  ""We cannot control the things life does to us. They are done before you know it, and once they are done, they make you do other things. Until at last everything comes between you and the man you wanted to be. ""

It seems to me that this points to the idea that respect and appreciation are required for whatever personality we had to create for ourselves in order to survive childhood.  One possible way to not let a once needed personality take over one's life is to look at our feelings as ""Your Inner Child of the Past"" (title of book by Hugh Missildine) with current adult eyes paving the way for a new relationship between ourselves and our old hurts.  When a feeling arises tempting an ""outer child"" acting-out reaction, one can note to self, ""Ah, this is the inner child of the past."" Dr. Missildine reports that the act of naming our feelings ""inner child of the past,"" followed by a pause, can often give us enough space to choose differently.

Clue two comes from this exchange between two of the characters in the film:
Eleanor: We are just trying to get to the truth.
New York D.A.: I get it. But what you need to remember is that there's what people want to hear, there's what people want to believe, there's everything else, then there's the truth.
Eleanor: And since when is that ok? I can't even believe you are saying this to me. The truth means responsibility, Arnie.
New York D.A.: Exactly. Which is why everyone dreads it.

This seems to highlight the existence of a fear to live according to one's heart where reactions from defense mechanisms clamor for expression.  How can an understanding of defense mechanisms contribute to healing a person?  Does a feeling of responsibility unconsciously remind a person of their buried guilt and thus a wish to avoid both?

I think the movie's tagline, ""Is your money making a killing?"" is one of the most provocative taglines in movie history.  It points to the issue of ethics, empathy and the defense mechanism of splitting.  By allowing hostility to remain unchecked in one's split off unconscious, one may find themselves acting out passive aggressively (under the guise of narcissistic entitlement) by investing in stocks that puts profit before people.  Perhaps this issue is an expression of Leonard's Shengold's concept of ""soul murder.""  In his book with the same title, he notes that if one's soul has been (metaphorically) murdered in childhood, one may then try to find some way to make up for this ""invisible crime.""

I think clue four comes from this line early on in the film:  ""I am more comfortable tense.""  Although the character may have said this in jest, I think it points to the reminder that many feelings are stored in the body.  So if ""every body tells a story,"" what story might a tense body be telling?

Quotes five to seven:  ""Sometimes a man can meet his destiny on the road he took to avoid it""  (Isn't it very common to lose one's way on the road to finding it?)  ""Character is easier kept than recovered."" (empathy for this major loss).  ""Sometimes the hardest thing in life is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn."" (one more thing we all have in common)

I wonder about the connections between guilt and debt.  Could debt be an outward extension or manifestation of guilt?  I don't believe that a blue jay or a polar bear or even a maple leaf is born guilty of anything.  By extension I don't believe that humans are born bad or guilty of anything either.  But many, or perhaps all children, to one degree or another, acquire the belief that they are somehow guilty or responsible for their parents' moods or problems.  It seems that due to the child's highly dependent state, the mammalian brain decides that it's better to take/assume blame for what's going on and create a personality around it in order to increase its chances of ongoing connection, and therefore survival, with parents.  Was it by chance later on discovered that people can potentially unconsciously feel less alone and therefore safer if they are in debt?  Debt as Mother?  It's hard to believe but from the point of view of the mammalian brain, I can't help but wonder if there could be a hint of truth in this somewhere.  Can the inner indebtedness of guilt lead to an outer indebtedness to who/whatever stands in for symbolic mother?

Overall, I found this film to be somewhat on the cold and depressing side but it is also, as one newspaper movie reviewer wrote, ""a thriller with brainpower and firepower.""",1413763200,3,5188,4.6071817192600655

859764,2,6304278691,"Here's another of my movie reviews from Epinions, and I wanted to share them with Amazon.com

I was asked to review this film by two good friends (both movie buffs), who have an honest intellectual disagreement about whether this film deserves a thumbs up or thumbs down.  They have asked me to break the tie.  Now I could be wimpy, and give a final 3 star review, thus cutting the baby in half, like wise King Solomon, but as they say in the Old Testament, ""no guts no glory.""  Therefore, this review had to come down either above or below 3 stars.  Having not seen the movie in the theaters, I rented it on blu-ray and watched it on my Sharp 65 inch set, with full surround sound, to be sure I experience it in all its director-intended glory.

Some spoilers follow.

Clive Owen has had an interesting career.  Unfortunately, his choice of films to star in has been somewhat uneven.  I liked him in Sin City, but didn't care for his performance in King Arthur.  He was in The Bourne Identity, but I wonder if anyone remembers that.  I found The Inside Man to be slow as well.  Although his IMDB credits are extensive, I have not seen a majority of the movies listed (and suspect that only die hard Clive Owen fans have). I like his screen presence, but he needs an interesting story (and a strong co-star) to shine.  Regretably, this story is just not interesting enough and his co-star, Naomi Watts was no help at all. Her credits are similarly off beat.

The script teases us that in international finance, the banks are hiding a dirty little secret: namely, that they do more than just give out mortgage loans.  The corruption goes so far and so high that they operate with impunity.  They have the cooperation of governments, and what they can't bury, they kill and bury.  In the words of one of the characters, the banks gain power by extending credit, and keeping those they want to politically manipulate in debt to them.  As interesting as that sounds, the screenplay seems to bog down at every turn.  Just when you think something is going to turn exciting, people start talking, and talking, and talking.  According to the IMDB website: ""After badly received previews, the film was pushed back from its August 2008 release date to February 2009 to allow re-shoots to turn it into more of an action film"".  It seemed as though this director was having trouble getting focus.

Owens and Watts play two Interpol officers who are trying to penetrate the complex web of murder that seems to point to a ""respectable"" financial institution.  They talk a lot, but something was missing.  Chemistry is what they used to call it, and between them I felt none.

This type of movie is like a John le Carre novel (The Spy Who Came In From The Cold written in 1963), and which Richard Burton performed in the movie version in 1965.  Good films (and novels) don't have to be full of action, but they do have to deliver on drama, romance, or suspense.  I mention in my title ""3 Days of the Condor"".  In that film, which had a similar plodding storyline punctuated with moments of terror, Robert Redford was the focus of the film.  The story was about him, and how he solved a mystery to save his life.  In 3 Days, he meets a woman at random and the two become intimate.  They had great chemistry and we were involved in their dangers.

The problem here is that the story was more about a bank, and not enough about the people.  We care about people, not banks.  Moreover, the International storyline is confusing, and there are far too many characters being introduced.  Instead of focusing on our two main Interpol officers, we meet new characters at every turn, who are important enough to keep reappearing.  Many sub-companies are revealed, without explanation as to how they are connected to the bank, or why they are involved.  The ending is completely baffling.

In this film, we have an opportunity for romance between our two main characters, but alas, nothing happens.  So without romance, we need suspense, but alas again, there is little of that.  Ok, what's left?  Oh yes, action.  The best (and really only) action scene in this movie occurs at the Guggenheim Museum in New York--or at least it sure looked like the Guggenheim getting torn to shreds by machine gun fire.  That scene was worth the price of admission.  I could not believe it was really filmed there as the destruction was complete.  I found out that it was filmed in a duplicate set based on the original Guggenheim blueprints, built in an old locomotive warehouse over a period of four months.  But even that action scene made no sense.  The premise of that big scene was that the powers that be decided to do away with their hired assassin, so they lure him to a public place and hire not less than 10 men with machine guns to do the job.  Now since the whole premise of the movie is that no one can hide from the bank, and since they can apparently find anyone, why use so much force in so public a place?  In the opening scene they kill a guy with a needle stick.  Moreover, that gunfight goes on for a good 10 minutes, yet not one police car arrives at the scene until our star drags a bleeding assassin out the front door and somehow carries him to the waterfront without anyone noticing.  And pcomsec points out in his well written review, what's the point of wearing a bullet proof vest if you just take it off in the middle of the gunfight! I guess you have to because the story writers said you must be shot.

An Italian politician is introduced and immediately shot.  The guy who thinks he is the shooter is framed (a la Lee Harvey Oswald, for conspiracy fans) for the crime and killed (a la Jack Ruby) before he can tell what he knows.  All this was done to point the finger at the Red Brigade.  Again, that's a lot of work when you could simply have left clues at the scene of the crime pointing to the party you want to blame (maybe some red shoes, red bullet casings, red fibers,.. you get my drift).  Despite the either inept or corrupt Italian police not being able to figure out trajectories of two adjacent bullet holes, our heros get an all important shoe print which happens to be a one in a million type of shoe for a one in a million type of fake leg.  Some script writer had too much caffeine and was overworking this one a bit.

Having said all that, the film has one saving grace.  The cinematography is outstanding, with plenty of artistic shots and wonderful views of various European cities.  I give high marks to whoever chose the camera shots.  On a big screen, it was magnificent, but that cannot save my negative impressions.  You might enjoy the film just for that aspect alone.  If you are an art person who has visited the Guggenheim, you are certain to cringe at the realistic damage inflicted on a great institution.",1399248000,,6829,4.488240064882401

For the record, my favorite for the previous decade was ""The Russia House"" (1990). What I look for in a great film is similar to my expectations of great literature. A great film is one in which the artists combine film elements, such as choice of locations and camera angles, to offer an experience that may heighten the viewer's awareness of the reality in which we all live. As other Amazon customer reviewers have pointed out, there is a substantial amount of truth underlying the fictional story portrayed in ""The International.""

The film's theme is most clearly stated during the interview between Salinger, Whitman and candidate Umberto Calvini. Calvini explains that what financial elitists desire most is neither control of countries nor the outcome of wars, but control of the debt generated by such activities. Collecting interest on massive debt allows a select few to accumulate inestimable fortunes.

By alternating close-up, intimate shots of Salinger with shots where the protagonist is dwarfed by one or another architecturally-magnificent building, director Tykwer seems to pose the question of the comparable value of an individual human life versus the grandeur of international economic and political structures.

For a thought-provoking fictional look at why some people seem to have such a voracious appetite for obtaining more wealth than they could ever possibly use, I recommend John Rather's novel ""Arius.""  For a factual rendering of issues relating to the financial industry, I recommend the documentary film ""Inside Job"" (2010).",1339545600,3,1689,5.362264150943396

860230,5,6304278691,"--SPOILER ALERT--

Caught in a racheting come-along of corrupt and criminal realities, Interpol Agent Lou Salinger (Clive Owen) is taken to his breaking point.  He's been fiercely living inside the law, despite watching innocent people die as they got close to exposing the criminal operations of the International Bank of Business and Credit--the IBBC.  He's been fiercely living under the law, despite his investigations being undermined by unexplained forces and despite his character being officially and wrongfully smeared.

The film opens with the death of investigative colleague Tommy Shumer, hit in broad daylight in Berlin with an injection of a poison cocktail that drops him in a minute and then disappears out of his system.

The come-along ratchets Salinger into a conference with Berlin police officials, who work from an initial coroner's finding of death by heart attack, into Salinger's dossier at Scotland Yard--which smears him for mishandling an IBBC investigation before dismissal from the Yard.  The German officials will require more than ""unsubstantiated theories"" before there's any police action against the IBBC in Germany.

The IBBC bad guys--executives and their slick legal council, Martin White (Patrick Baladi)--are smuggly moving to cause a bloody revolution in an African nation and Middle East warfare from their headquarters in Luxembourg.  They're riding high on the debt that the conflicts will generate.  Lou Salinger and his task-force teammate, Manhattan ADA Eleanor Whitman (Namoi Watts) must seem like the least of their problems.

Tommy Shumer was killed just after first contact with an IBBC insider who initially would not give the invesigators his name.  However, Salinger knows from his previous experience with the IBBC that the insider's life is forfeit.

Salinger combs through news reports of recent deaths and finds the insider.  He is Andr Clement--the bank's senior VP in charge of acquisitions.

As the come-along ratchets Clement's death past a lie by bank chairman Jonas Skarssen (Ulrich Thomsen), stonewalled and covered up in Salinger's presence by legal council Martin White and a French Gendarmerie official, ADA Whitman makes contact with Clement's widow.  The shaken widow, with two young children to protect, directs the investigators to Italian Prime Minister hopeful, Umberto Calvini (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi).

Calvini--a tall, broad-shouldered man of rare presence--is the lynch-pin that will bring the IBBC's Skarssen to a strange sort of two-step vigilante justice and family retribution.  Andr Clement was Calvini's trusted friend.  To aid the investigators, Calvini describes the bank's purchase of billions of dollars worth of missiles which need guidance systems that only his company and one other--in Turkey--can build and sell to the bank.  He will not sell, now that his friend has been murdered.  He clearly suspects the bank's culpability.

Unfortunately, Skarssen's justice can't happen until Calvini is murdered by a double sniper scheme laid on by the IBBC--minutes after Salinger and Whitman talk to him.

In the immediate aftermath of the Calvini murder, Salinger and Whitman identify the bank's assassin and, with two NYPD detectives helping, run him and his IBBC handler to ground at NYC's Guggenheim.

The bank executives have noticed that Salinger is onto their assassin.  They order the handler, the elderly former Stasi Colonel, Wilhelm Wexler (Armin Mueller-Stahl), to ""sever all ties with their consultant"".  Wexler orders the hit at the Guggenheim.  He puts serveral shooters into play, and true to his prediction, taking out the assassin gets messy.

The shootout at the Guggenheim is spectacular.

Salinger survives, as does one of the two NYPD detectives.  The bank's assassin, after a courageous and expertly executed fight, dies of his wounds.

The surviving detective, who followed the handler out of the Guggenheim before the shooting started, has nabbed Wexler and taken him to an unofficial interrogation room.  ADA Whitman has scored a CIA ""Intelligence Report Excerpt"" on Wilhelm Wexler and has turned it over to Salinger.  Whitman makes sure that Salinger has time to read the CIA material before he interrogates Wexler.

The CIA document allows Salinger to understand that communism-believer Wexler must surely be disaffected by his work for the nazified bank.  Wexler truely is.  He's had just about all of himself that he can take.  But during the interrogation, Wexler drops the bombshell that changes Salinger's life forever.

Salinger has demanded that Skarssen must be brought to justice and that Wexler must help.

With educated and slowly delivered words in his pleasant, mild German accent, Wexler responds, ""...your idea of justice is an illusion.  Don't you understand, the very system you serve and protect will never allow anything to happen to Skarssen or the bank?  On the contrary, the system guarantees the IBBC's safety, because everyone is involved. ... Hezbollah.  CIA.  The Columbian racketeers.  Russian organized crime.  Governments of Iran, Germany, China--and your government.  Every multinational corporation everywhere.  They all need banks like the IBBC so they can operate within the black and gray latitudes.  And this is why your investigative efforts have either been ignored or undermined--and why you and I will be quietly disposed of before any case against the bank ever reaches a court of law.  You understand, if you really want to stop the IBBC, you won't be able to do it within the boundaries of your system of justice.  You will have to go outside.  Once you do, there will always be collateral damage.  Yes, you can sacrifice your own ideals for the greater good.  That's a difficult choice--one I understand all too well. ...""

""The greater good"" has resonance in all vigilante stories, from Robin Hood to Lou Salinger.  This is a leading reason why good men and women go outside the law for justice.  It's why Salinger cuts his ties with ADA Whitman, turning outlaw officially, and leaving Whitman clean for a later investigation of the IBBC.  It's why Salinger will help Wexler to his redemption by trapping the IBBC's need for missle guidance systems against public disclosure that the missles are useless against the Israelis, who already have the guidance system counter-measures from the Turkish manufacturer.  The trap will leave the bank without buyers for the missles on which they've spent billions--and, if it works, it will break the bank.

The greater good is why Salinger will tell the Calvini brothers, unwise sons of the murdered Umberto, the whole story of the IBBC.  It will hold up a mirror to the sons' guilt in their father's death.  If they hadn't flashed their willingness to sell the guidance systems to the IBBC, their father might still be alive.

Salinger will collect a slight reward when the Calvini brothers disappear the bank's legal slickster, Martin White, into a mountain side of rock--the first collateral damage of Salinger's actions.  But the greater good is also why Salinger will unintentionally pull Wexler along to his collateral damage death in trying to slam the guidance systems trap shut.  It's why he will face Skarssen on a Constantinople rooftop walkway, aggressively point Wexler's 9mm pistol at Skarssen's face, and shout, ""I want some fxxxing justice"".

Salinger's first-step vigilante shot into Skarssen's chest does not kill him, but it tumbles him off his feet.  The second step is left to a Calvini-family-employed assassin, who looks very much like he's done this before.  After disarming Salinger of Wexler's Czech-made CZ-75, the elderly, balding, well-dressed man walks down to Skarssen.

""With compliments of Enzo and Mario Calvini"", he says--in Italian, translated to English on the screen--before his chrome Browning HP blasts Skarssen's eyes closed forever.  He walks back up the short flight of stairs, and as he passes Salinger on the roof-peak walkway, he says, ""Thank you"", in Italian. ""Grazi"".  He keeps Wexler's pistol.  Evidence in the Skarssen murder has been removed from Salinger by the Calvini rep.

The film ends in a melding of newspaper reports showing that the IBBC survived Skarssen's death.  The Wexler trap didn't work, and Syria is testing the missles that seemingly threaten Israel--the guidance system counter-measures apparently still secretly held by Israel.

The clippings show that ADA Whitman has lined up her killer investigation, this one in the US Senate--one of the most global-corruption-ridden institutions on the planet.

The worldwide system of corruption that protected the IBBC through its murderous and debt-grabbing operations under Skarssen has not even hiccuped.  It will simply wallow on, protecting the global systemic corruption by the superrich, as Skarssen predicted.

Will it take vigilantism on a massive, global scale to collapse the corruption system?  There's a sequel in there.

The newspaper reporters don't pursue Salinger.

I won't give anything away but the Guggenheim scene is unreal but watch the extras on how they did it is even more mindblowing.

Having said all that the acting is terrific from Clive Owen's world weary intensity to Naomi Watts' single mindedness and, unlike mail-it-in Hollywood movies, they don't end up in bed together which makes their working realtionship seem far more real.

The bad guys all seem like fairly normal family men which makes them all the more evil.

The movie sort of falls down a tad on the plot as you wonder how a large bank (it's loosely based on the real BCCI banking scandal) is brought down by just two people. Seems quite implausible no matter how good Watts and Owen are in portraying their roles.

860239,2,6304278691,"Other than an NRA meeting at the Guggenheim, and a rooftop chase that was ubiquitously shown - and lit with continuity error - in the preview, I didn't find director Tom Tykwer's The International all that entertaining.  Slow paced and character driven, this dry movie tries too hard to be The Pelican Brief.  A movie that actually worked.  Then again, Naomi Watts is not Julia Roberts and Clive Owen couldn't wear Denzel's jock strap.

Louis Salinger (Owen) is a rugged Interpol agent teamed up with NY Asst. DA Elinor Whitman (Watts) to unravel a mystery involving the IBBC, a financial institution thinly veiled as real-world BCCI, involved with government overthrow, political influence, and international arms dealing when not assessing late fees and discussing mutual funds with customers.  Early on the viewer learns one immutable fact: Cross the IBBC, and die at the hands of their world-traveling, jack-of-all-trades, single assassin.  Yep, one creepy looking guy with a leg brace and a single pair of special shoes that can be tracked down to the manufacturer.  Apparently they didn't learn the pitfalls of employing handicapped killers from The Fugitive.  Much like the flaw of hiring a single, handicapped assassin as the only go-to guy - except for when they needed to cover the assassin's steps, in which case they had roughly 30 shmoes with uzis show up for target practice - The International has multiple other problems.  A little deus ex machina would have helped fill the massive chasm left in the plot when determining how exactly the IBBC would have benefited from their nefarious dealings, why there were only two people on such a massive case, and why exactly Syria would need to deal with them.  Gaps like these cause viewer disinterest, apathy towards which characters survive, and ultimately have caused Baysplosions to gain notoriety in the film industry.  Notwithstanding the above, I saw at least two blatant continuity errors (e.g. scissors disappear from one scene, a scarf magically unties itself in another) and a boom-mic in one scene.

In the end, the movie felt too much like a political hit piece on a four country tour.  Little cinematic substance, no profound lesson, and Clive Owen's scowl can only carry a movie so far.",1309305600,2,2260,5.043010752688172

860306,4,6304278691,"I always find it interesting watching a film that obviously a lot of work went into and then was in and out of theaters in about 2 weeks.  The International is such a film.  This film about an enormous bank involved in all sort of international conspiracies is beautifully filmed all over the world: New York, Milan, Paris, Turkey, etc.  The architecture where each scene was filmed was carefully chosen.  There is a exciting shootout that takes place in the Guggenheim museum in New York.  As a New Yorker, I was quite interested in how the Guggenheim would let them film such an action packed sequence with so many hundreds of rounds of ammunition being fired.  As I learned in one of the documentaries after the film, they built an exact replica of the inside of the Guggenheim inside an abandoned factory that used to build locomotives.  The set was built in 6 weeks while the real Guggenheim took 4 years to build.  All this work for a film that was neither a critical nor box office success.
Clive Owen is scruffy, unshaven, rumpled and generally filthy looking the entire film as the obsessed Interpol agent looking to bring this bank down.  (Owen looks like such a mess that he looks like someone who might have been comfortable with Strother Martin and Warren Oates in a Peckinpah western)  Naiomi Watts has little to do as the Manhattan Assistant D.A. who assists him.  She looks good but is dressed down for most of the film since she is essentially playing a civil servant. She is happily married so there is no romance between her and Owen.  The supporting cast is fine.

The devastating fact that is brought to light in the film is that banks (and other powerful institutions) foment wars in third-world countries and then buddy up to warring parties to whom they lend vast sums of money for arms; when the victor finally emerges, bankrupt, the bank takes its repayment in the form of mining rights to the country's natural resources--which is what they wanted in the first place. (There are no shortages of examples of this in history.) As one of the bank's bad guys explains in the movie: the profit is not in selling arms, the profit is made in keeping countries at war and thus, in perpetual debt to the banks.  The real victims are the people of these exploited countries who live in abject poverty while foreign corporations exploit the fat of the land.

The evil of such premeditated criminality is almost too awful to fathom. The venal ways of the world may be old news to some, but if it isn't out there in some larger format, easily digestible by millions of people, it might as well be buried in a book. And there aren't a whole lot of films like this that get made for obvious reasons.

Even the one sniper segment couldn't save the film because of how unrealistic, exaggerated and unsatisfactory it was.  The only memorable part was the intense shooting scene near the end.

Political, militar and economic. The bloody slaughter around the key personages around this complex web of sinsiter interests rekindled in our memory ""The dogs of war"".

Clive Owen and Naomi Watts seconded by the legendary actor Armin Muller Stahl (one of the top twenty best actors alive)lead the investigation. But every time they find a clue, the more narrow is their radio of action. Bureaucratic hindrances, wrought reports, unthinkable missings, questions without answers turn the investigation into a true puzzle of multiple angles.

Ambitious, absorbing and breathtaking thriller that will capture your whole attention from start to finish. Don't let trhis film passes in front of you without your consent. Watch it as soon as you can.

There is plenty of cleverness all along for the thinking person. The film is subtly gripping. You have to put out some effort to follow along. I had to back-up the DVD once in the beginning; to answer the question, ""Was anyone near the victim between his exiting the car, and walking up to Clive Owen?""

Filmed on location in: Berlin & Wolfsburg, Germany; Milan & Lake Garda, Italy; Lyon, France; Istanbul, Turkey, and New York.

860313,4,6304278691,"Clive Owen and Naomi Watts hedline this international thriller.

I first watched this film several months ago.  Maybe I wasn't paying that close attention or I wasn't in the mood for this kind of thriller the first time I watched it, but if I had writted my review then I would most likely have given it three stars.  This time, though, I payed much closer attention to the storyline, the plot development, and overlapping themes, and now I think this film is definitely worth four stars.  It will probably never be a 5-star selection, but I really liked it.

Like any good thriller THE INTERNATIONAL gets started right off...someone dies, somewhat mysteriously, within the first 5-10 mins, and you are hooked as you try to figure out who died, how it happened, and who would benefit from that death if it was due to foul play.  Get ready for conspiracy and corruption to come screaming at you.

Clive Owen plays a former member of Scotland Yard, but who now works for INTERPOL.  Naomi Watts plays an Asst District Attorney in NYC, and they are collaborating on a case where a large multi-national bank appears to be engaged in the purchase of large amounts of high-tech military equipment.  Why?  That's the whole story.

So, lest you think that this is just a cerebral exercise in following a trail, the action movie fans out there will be pleased to know that there is a good dose of gunfire, but there aren't really any high speed chase scenes...oh well.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film the 2nd time, and, as I mentioned above, much more than the first time around.  I didn't even have to wait until the old ""third time's the charm"" to increase my viewing pleasure with this film.  There was, after all, quite a bit I missed the first time around.

But I love this movie poster design. Of course I'm biased as an architect to anything with Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum from New York City on it. The clean and simple graphics and layout of this poster grab me. It's nice to see a poster WITHOUT a close-up of an actor's face for a change.

This movie is basically an action/thriller/drama in the vein of the recent James Bond movies with Daniel Craig, The Bourne movies, and a mix of other films from the 2000s. It's got a lot of influences in it IMO.  The pace of the film is pretty steady, with some action scenes revving it up, but mostly it just goes along in a rhythm. The shooting scenes in the Guggenheim are spectacular and remind me of the shoot out in downtown LA during the bank robbery in Michael Mann's epic film Heat (1995), one of my Top 5 films of all time btw. I would love to know how they got the Guggenheim to allow them to film there, and then shoot it all up! They must have needed some renovations and got a big check from the studio.

I think what I liked best about this film were the locations and the photography. The acting was decent, but a little flat emotionally.  Nothing Oscar-worthy here. The architecture at the locations is incredible, and the attention to set design detail is like any great minimalistic piece of architecture. While there is nothing cutting edge or unusual about the photography, it's just so well done. Same with the editing.

Many of these films are played out in the context of the Cold War, drug smuggling, the illegal arms trade, and other criminal activities.  But the one thing they all share is that they do not even come close to alluding to real life events or people.  Until now, with this 2009 release.  The movie follows the ordeal of an Interpol agent and a US assistant district attorney in their investigation of an international bank called IBBC that is suspected of weapons dealing.  The IBBC itself is ruled by a group of very wealthy individuals from numerous countries, and they are linked to political leaders around the world.  For those in the know, the acronym IBBC is a strong allusion to the actual entity BCCI, a multinational bank staffed by well-connected individuals.  The IBBC, like the real-life entity BCCI, uses its political connections to provide weapons to various countries.  These countries then use the weapons to wage wars which put them into debt, debt to the IBBC.  This theory is not new, and there are many history books examining the role of debt to the Rothschild banking empire in the European wars of the 1800s.  The use of debt to control countries is also a common theme in modern history, with the IMF and WTO being the guilty culprits here.  All of this information is revealed to the movie's protagonists over the course of the film.  The movie also features some great gun-fight scenes and some good dialogue.

But if you're a Hitchcock fan, I think you'll have some fun with _The International_.  Just about all the comments note the exceptional visual design of the film, and it really is impressive.  But Clive Owen is what makes this movie go, and his performance is excellent.  Also generally excellent is the work of the supporting cast, with special kudos to the great actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.  Naomi Watts' role is oddly ancillary, but I think that's a result of intelligent decisions made by the writer about the nature of her relationship with Owen (the scene where she and Owen talk during Owen's interrogation of Mueller-Stahl is excellent and reveals her real function in the film, I think).  If you come to this film expecting the usual action movie roller coaster, you'll be disappointed.

860412,4,6304278691,"Director Tom Tykwer's, The International (2009) is taut, complicated, suspense thriller, with lots of intrigue, atmosphere, and mystery, that occasionally explodes with violence, as the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC), a multinational financial organization, is suspected of being involved in various illegal activities including murder, weapons dealing, and conspiring to destabilize governments.

Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) is an Interpol agent, investigating IBBC.  While in Berlin, an associate of Salinger's dies suddenly, causing Manhattan district attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts), who is building the case against IBBC, to come to Berlin to head the investigation.  Trying to get information about some kind of weapons deal, the pair eventually get a lead to Umberto Calvini (Luca Barbareschi) a candidate to be Italy's prime minister.  Shortly after providing crucial information to the investigators, Calvini is assassinated while giving a speech in Milan.  A shoe print provides the lead to the suspected assassin, who is now in New York City.

Working with the NYPD, Salinger hunts the IBBC's hitman known as the Consultant (Brian O'Byrne).  They catches a break, and as their quarry is seen on the street, and followed to the Guggenheim Museum.  The IBBC believes the Consultant must be eliminated, and a spectacular violent shootout takes place in the gallery.  Wilhelm Wexler (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an associate with IBBC, is the key to drawing IBBC CEO Jonas Skarssen (Ulrich Thomsen) into a trap in Istanbul.

The International, is a complicated affair, where the many twists and turns, and the various players, makes matters a little difficult to keep track of.  You really have to pay attention.  It has kind of a cold, impersonal, businesslike tone, with Salinger being the steady driving force behind the action.  Clive Owen (Shoot 'Em Up) is great in almost everything he does, and he gives a another solid performance, as the determined, but somewhat burnt out and paranoid, Salinger.  The supporting cast is excellent as well.  The film is well written, intelligent, moves at a quick pace, and seems mostly believable, under the direction of Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run).  The shootout in the Guggenheim is an exception to the overall realism of the film, but it smartly executed, memorable, and packs a wallop.

Tykwer and writer Eric Singer provide an informative commentary track, and the DVD also contains a nice set of bonus featurettes and an extended deleted scene.

Also, the main characters have developing problems, you don't have idea of what kind of relation owen and watts have (friends?, sis-bro kinda?, lovers? (no way), is owen horny for watts?, watts wants owen but cant betray her husband?? WHAT??...or they are just two robots walking through life??).

Usually it's at least three decades before Hollywood catches up.) In both the movie and in reality, the BCCI (or IBBC, if you'd rather) was an international bank that laundered money for CIA ""black ops"", i.e. the funding of Osama bin Laden, Noriega, the Taliban, Saddam Hussein, etc. Individuals associated with the bank included the Bush family, Henry Kissinger and the other movers and shakers behind the ""little wars"" of the Reagan era. John Kerry was the man who busted the bank, not with bullets, of course, but with subpoenas. (Reality is less juicy than fiction.)

So, to ""juice it up"" Hollywood turned the BCCI scandal into an action/thriller flick. To a certain degree they were successful. Clive Owen was, as always, edgy and intense. There was a nice shoot-out in the Guggenheim and a Bourne-style rooftop chase. But, as the banker said in the end, ""If you shoot me, there will be a hundred more just like me."" (I'm paraphrasing.) Needless to say, the banker was right. And, as other characters pointed out, the business of banks is debt--through which we are all enslaved, nation and individual alike. So, there was really no reason for the IBBC to sell arms or to assassinate anybody, which made most of the action in this action film entirely nonsensical. If the banks are already financing arms deals via the CIA, the US Dept of Agriculture (crops are always a good front), and everybody else under the sun, why bother?

Those in the market for a solid, old-fashioned spy thriller need look no further than ""The International,"" a movie that harkens back, in tone and style, to those post-Bond Harry Palmer films (""The Ipcress File,"" ""Funeral in Berlin"") from the 1960s.  Here, Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger, an Interpol agent who's teamed up with Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts), an assistant district attorney of the city of New York, to help bring down a major bank they suspect of brokering arms to terrorists.  When one of his fellow agents is assassinated, Salinger sprints into action, even though, technically, he has no real authority to apprehend the bad guys.

Complex, serious and swarming with red herrings, ""The International"" is one of those movies where they throw terms like ""file"" and ""dossier"" around with gleeful abandon - and we relish every minute of it.  In addition, it comes replete with all the shady characters, covert encounters and glamorous international settings (Berlin, Lyon, Istanbul, etc.) we've come to expect in our secret agent thrillers.

860482,3,6304278691,"Did you ever watch a movie and really, and I mean really, want to like it? ""The International"" is just such a film. I am a big Clive Owen fan, I like action and mystery, I do not like movies that are confused at their genre and full of sloppy writing however.

Things start off on an even enough keel. Clive Owen plays an Interpol Agent who watches one of his partners vomit and fall over dead after being poisoned directly following a meeting with members of the evil bank (The International Bank of Business and Credit). Owen rushes across the street to render aide to his fallen comrade and gets to the berm when he gets hit in the back of a head by the mirror of an oncoming van and gets knocked out cold on the side of the road, falling beside his partner. This is exactly how useful his character is for the rest of the film. Not at all.

Once Owen's partner is killed we're barely introduced to Noami Watts who is the New York City  Assistant District Attorney. There's not really a lot of plot surrounding her or why she's involved with the case. It's more just kind of *poof*, there she is... and then she disappears for large chunks of the movie. She is supposed to be Owen's partner in the investigation but she is around for so little of it that it doesn't really feel like she belongs. The only thing she manages to do is talk on the phone a lot and get run over by a car. Movie would have flowed just fine with out her.

So let's get down to the plot, the mostly boring, outlandish, and very hard to follow plot. I don't like admitting when I can't follow a plot, I'll be honest. I feel like it's failure on my part. Maybe I wasn't watching the movie close enough or maybe I am just too stupid to get it. I don't really feel bad about missing large chunks of ""The International""s plot because I blame the poor writing. But in any case Owen and Watts start to investigate the background of the evil bank. They find that people who are in charge routinely disappear and eventually that the bank is dealing in weapons and war or anything else that can make them a buck or help them manipulate the market. With that secret out in the open they decide they have to put a stop to it and the international jet setting hi jinks ensues. There's a lot of changes in local, a politician is assassinated,  and we watch Clive Owen get angrier and angrier at the evil bank but in the end nothing really happens.

I think that's probably why ""The International"" failed. It wasn't sure if it was a mystery, a political message, or a James Bond movie. Of these three it accomplished zero. The mystery wasn't really that sound or very interesting (here's a secret, it's the evil bank!). The political message that money is evil and so are banks is kind of stupid and poorly played out. Perhaps where it failed most was it's attempt at action. Clive Owen is Mr. Action, just look at him in the ""Bourne Identity"" or as `The Driver' in the BMW shorts and he was a candidate to be the next James Bond! So what went wrong? Well first of all I don't know anything about Interpol, but for being like an FBI agent Owen doesn't have his own weapon, gets into several gun fights, and always has to barrow someone else's gun. It would be different if he was able to handle himself like `The Driver' and didn't need a weapon to get himself out of a jam, but he really really needs the gun. Secondly there is almost no action in the movie, someone gets capped here or there but its usually anti climactic.

This can NOT be said for the amazing Guggenheim shoot out scene however. It's action at a mile a minute! It is literally the only reason to pop this movie in your dvd player but with all the other boring-ness going on it feels terribly out of place. The only way I can think to put it in context would be to imagine hopping on the ride Pirates of the Caribbean, you're sailing along for a few moments enjoying the saucy pirates when from out of nowhere the twelve foot tall abominable snow man from Expedition Everest attacks you and before you realize what's just happened you're sailing through pirate world again. That said I can't give ""The International"" a very high score. I really wanted to like it, I tried really hard, but its convoluted plot, identity crises, and inconsequential characters make it just barely watchable. It gets a four from me. One point for Clive Owen (it's not really his fault the character was horrible) and three points for the spectacular Guggenheim scene, even if it was out of place.",1263686400,,4509,4.360714285714286

But the story rambles and mixes intrigue with silliness and deaths and car chases and endless pursuits through parking structures and Turkish rooftops, all as a platform for Clive Owens to show the type of role he does best.  And he is excellent as the agent with a mixed past Louis Salinger.  Naomi Watts is wasted in a routine role as an American law agent Eleano Whitman, and Armin Mueller-Stahl is of course added as the involved bad guy turned redeemer, Wilhelm Wexler.

860587,4,6304278691,"""The International"" is a natural attraction for fans of Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy and John LeCarre thrillers. It is set in Europe and USA and involves an interantional bank funding terrorism that principals Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, as an Interpol agent and New York prosecutor, respectively, are trying to put out of business.

The serpentine plot will lose a lot of viewers the first time through becuase it involves high finance, an assassination with a bigger conspiracy than anyone imagined for the Kennedy assassination, Europe's military-industrial complex, a gunfight in New York's Guggenheim that leaves you wondering who are the good guys, further realignment of alliances between friend and foe afterward, a slowdown at the end that will have you wondering if this is the same film, and, finally, a second assassination that may leave you scratching your head if you haven't followed closely and taken notes.

I take issue with Amazon's description that, ""The International is actually two movies in one: A highbrow thriller about a sprawling bank that resorts to murder and arms sales to retain its power, and a sleek visual essay on how architecture and interior design shapes your perceptions."" This may be true if you are a fan of archtecture.

Otherwise, the changing view of architecture in the movie merely sets you up for the constant shifting of position globally where the action takes place. The movie was shot in a studio with on-site filming in several spots in Italy, Turkey, Luxembourg, New York, Germany and elsewhere. The gorgeous on-site shooting makes ""The International"" a travelogue as well as a good thriller.

The conspiracy element is, to me, the film's high point. There's more paranoia in the first hour of this movie than anything I've seen since Alan Pakula's ""paranoia triolgy"" of the 1970s --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Klute/dp/B00005U2KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Klute</a>, a murder mystery;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Parallax-View/dp/B00000IRE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Parallax View</a>, an assassination conspiracy themed after the Kennedy assassination; and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-the-President-s-Men/dp/B000CEXEWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All the President's Men</a>, the movie from the book of the same name about the Watergate conspiracy.

Unfortunately, there is so much going on in ""The International"" that it takes mapquest to keep you appropriately guided and the conspiracy element gets washed over by changing allegiances in the second hour. Still, this is an exciting film for fans of international thrillers.

As much as this will draw you in and glue you to the action, there's so much going on you probably won't catch it all the first time, so watch this a couple times to fully digest and appreciate the whole thing. It will be time well-spent.",1262304000,3,2973,5.886310904872389
860588,3,6304278691,"'The International' refers to a commercial bank - one specializing in gray- and black-market transactions, with a portfolio of customers that ensure they're too big to fail. This plot gets under way when it turns out that the bank also brokers arms deals, among other things, and connects non-governmental missile buyers with after-market guidance system upgrades.

We've been through the recent financial hooha, so it's hardly surprising that the bank's goals are a bit subtler than they would have been five years ago, but all the more believable for that reason. Clive Owen and Naomi Watts put in good performances as the good guys. Still, although this movie is easy to enjoy, it never rose above commodity entertainment.

860824,4,6304278691,"It is amazing how many reviewers here either didn't get this movie, or wish to rewrite it according to their own tastes.

One complains, for example, that to be effective in this day the international bank involved should have been Lehman Brothers, as if he expected someone to write a good thriller about bundled mortgage securities! He fails to understand, apparently, that this movie is about a totally different global identity in existence today, the far more shadowy international bank that, as is said in the movie, the world's major nations will always need for money laundering, bribes, third world revolutionary support and weapons transactions. This is the subject behind this movie, and a valid one it of course is.

Another reviewer professes confusion re the Clive Owen line in the movie about one sometimes meeting his destiny on the road one takes to avoid it. It was certainly clear, and reasonably eloquent as the Muller-Stahl character states, to me. In the context it was given, Owen was saying that the Muller-Stahl figure, a dedicated, 30 year hard-line Commie who with the collapse of that ideology in the early 90's had sold out to the capitalist system it was attacking, had now the chance to find some purpose to his life by using the very position he had taken in the corrupt, capitalist bank in question. In his accepting a path that allowed him to avoid trying to meet the original purpose of his life, he is now confronted with the opportunity to meet that very destiny he desired through supporting Owen in helping to defeat one of the more egregious symbols of that system.

Owen does an excellent job in portraying a character who refuses to take that other road and give up his own, daunting purpose to bring down the bank he was originally assigned to do as a British operative. He is teamed with Watts, a New York-based Federal prosecutor, who's own role is just as dedicated if somewhat less detailed. There are the usual hard to swallow coincidences - the assassin the bank uses just happens to live in New York - and situations bordering on disbelief - why on earth would the bank's lead villain, already knowing that his chief lawyer-in-conspiracy has apparently been offed, allow himself to meet with a chief rival without an ample bodyguard? But the film more than makes up for these shortcomings by its intelligence, its topicality, and its visual excitement having to do with the capitalist world's 'power' architecture, though to include the Guggenheim Museum designed by the primarily Jeffersonian, anti-capitalist Frank Lloyd Wright, is a decided contradiction. Nevertheless, the gun fight scene that takes place so excitingly and shatteringly in that building can be said to be symbolic of how the modern global system has destroyed such earlier, more individualistic and pastoral ideologies.

Today, with a higher educated population that uses digital networks such practices and purposes have permiated not only the city, county, national but also international opperations. The dark also provides a gray area service that is a highly refined and highly efficient corporate network system that runs on par with all other business, industry, medical and govenment operations. In many cases those who are right-honest-decent readily use the gray services offered by the dark side either on contract or permanent basis.
This DVD portrays the details of such a permanent presence on the world scene. It seems that no industry or government is immune to this gray and dark industry (e.g., Enron). On the government level, with this 'gray' service in mind, it will explain many 'irrational' policies, rules and practicies that emerge more frequently than not. Under such conditions one begins to read a different meaning into the country's legal application of constitutional rights. One can see the application of the gray and dark in Governments and any civilization. It is inversely proportional to the degree that 'Socialist formula' is applied to law, economics, social services, banking, education. etc. The Socialist influence, power and practice(Marxist, Facist, Militarist and Nazi - all 'socialist' and 'democratic' systems) clearly prove that the dark and gray parameters have gained control. Institutions, security forces, courts, 'social reponsibility' and demonization of populations - dividing society into two oppositing camps are the hallmark of the dark and gray effects in government and civilization resulting in failed civilizations.

The plot's a clunker though.  Many reviews played up the film's relevance given the recent banking crisis.  I'm certain Lehman did not fold due to a failed missile deal in the middle east.  Movies about business conspiracies always fall back into some clich about this, I suspect, as screenwriter have no idea how any sort of business works except movies.  This is also why films about the film business, though far too profligate and, now, tired are always greatly insightful while films about any other sort of Fortune 500 companies are always fabulously off base about what goes on in a company.

So, why, exactly, did the bank need to actually deal arms in order to 'control the debt' of an arms deal?  Why would Syria possibly need to deal with this bank in order to get anti-Israel missiles? This is their only source? Plus the bank seems incapable of getting missiles except from ONE guy in Turkey who won't sell missiles that will work against Israel.

Anyway, the best part is where the bank uses ONLY ONE ASSASIN for their super-secret assassinations. OK, fine, but the single assassin has a prosthetic foot and always wears the same shoe?  FYI, when I start bumping people off I'm going to make sure to either spread my assassinating around or demand the guy buys a second pair of kicks.  Plus, when the bank decides to kill their ONE assassin, they send no fewer than like a dozen guys to assassinate him.  Where were those dozen guys before? Couldn't use them to spread some assassinating around?  Also, if the two-shooter conspiracy can be debunked by one guy in 35 seconds with a stick, why bother? Also, in Turkey, how does the top arms-dealing banker end up alone? Also, in today's environment (2001-on), if you actually got as much of a whiff of a missile deal or rogue bank there would be 35 agencies on top.  Here, one DA and a disheveled Interpol agent.

Back to reviews, there have been a set of them recently about smart 'paranoid thrillers' like the Parallax View.  One, the Parallax view was a bad movie and there's a reason they stopped making them like that.  Let's stop romanticizing that.  Same (BTW) with 'The Conversation' which is 30 minutes of awesome sandwiching an hour and a half of nothing happening.  I remember Hackman's place from that movie more than many I've lived in because I spent more time there.  The International is nothing like these because, in the International things actually happen and the plot is utter nonsense.

Clive cuts his ties (cliche) saying ""There are some bridges you cross and some you burn (grasshopper)"" and just keeps on coming.

The build in the story is good - harking back to the days of 70's thrillers where intelligence, style and suspense made for an effective mix.  However, here the three have been distilled into separate sections of the movie.. the slow build with detective work followed by a suspenseful shoot out in the Guggenheim - one of the most effective set pieces of the year, and where a more sensible film would have found its climax.  However, at that point we are only half way through, and the tone shifts gear as our hero goes rogue to achieve his ends, and the moralising disconnects rather than engages, as the plotting unwinds from its taut beginnings to end in an unsatisfying collection of frayed ends.
Characterisation is slim, especially for Naomi Watts woefully 2 dimensional character, but the visuals are great.  The director clearly has an eye for design and architecture, the camera relishing in some stunning locations.  The locations often reflect the characters and moods of the movie, as we move from austere emotionless modern plazas and foyers around Europe, to shadowed columns as we meet the shady arms dealers, and the fascinating endless open rooftops of the final scenes as the film attempts resolution.

Naomi Watts is earning a fat paycheck from some other bank by playing the obligatory pretty American woman and FBI agent in a story that does nothing at all to take advantage of her considerable acting chops.

The writing is pure generic Hollywood style - with characters reciting lines intended at once to advance the plot and to explain things to the audience - but the action rarely manages to quicken the pulse in the way the best Hollywood action flicks do.

The message - that terrorism and despotism around the world are financed by international capitalists who are acting in their own self interest, and that nearly everyone has something at stake in the financial system that makes this possible - is perhaps timely but delivered in far too heavyhanded a fashion to be effective.

A therein lies one of The International's two main problems. It is ripped from the headlines. The problem is the headlines in question are from 1989. The movie is about The BCCI collapse. Unfortunately the script mimics the actual late eighties scandal a little to accurately for its own good.

There are clues that the script had been collecting dust for some time before the new bank crisis prompted it back in the mix. For example, one of the more famous BCCI clients was Samuel Doe, who was president of Liberia in the early eighties. Not exactly ripped from the headlines stuff, but the International doggedly creates a General Charles Motomba, played gamily by Lucian Msamati, who takes over Liberia with the banks help. Something that makes little sense in a year that starts with a two.

In another, what decade is this again moment, the hit man uses a payphone after receiving what appears to be a beeper message. For those under 35, and not 30 Rock fans, let me explain what a beeper was. A beeper was a cell phone that did not make calls. It only received phone numbers. Then you, the recipient of a 'beep', would have to find a payphone and call the number to talk to someone.

Now a payphone was a phone that the public would use instead of their own separate cell phones. They were metal and had many germs. If you visit a public transport hub, you can sometimes still find 'banks' of phones.

If it seems I am nitpicking, keep in mind the film itself lives in some uncanny valley between Michael Clayton and The Bourne Identity. Not nearly realistic enough for Clayton fans; and for the Bourne fans? Well there are about as many action set pieces as there are hours the film runs. (Read two) It is a surprisingly talky affair.

Speaking of talking, 'Sometimes a man can meet his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.' Can someone explain that quote to me. Our rumpled protagonist says it at least twice and it makes no bloody sense either time.

In addition, speaking of not making sense' late in the film in Istanbul (not Constantinople) one bad guy says to the other let me show you a something few man have seen and proceeds to take him to the Basilica Cistern. You know that underground canal featured In From Russia with Love and maybe the second Indiana Jones film and is one of Turkey's biggest tourist attractions. This makes about as much sense if he said it about the Statue of Liberty. (There is this statue; in the harbor, few men have seen my friend.)

What starts out as a meeting between Armin and the 'hired' killer, with Owen and two cops looking on, turns into a 'drive by' with at least ten of the bad guys all armed with machine pistols.  Owen kills at least six of them, picking up the guns of the dead ones to use on their friends.  They must shoot off close to one thousand rounds of ammunition and totally destroy the Guggenheim Museum.  But only the bad and good guys get his or killed, the 'civilians' just hide and scream.

After spending ten minutes shooting up the Museum, the Cops finally show up (about ten cars at once) en mass. It was almost like they were afraid to come by themselves.  So Owen drags the bad guy hired killer out of the Museum and carries him into Central Park.  No one is there no one is watching the Museum from across the street.

The movie seems to take place over three or four days in both Berlin and New York.  During this time, Naomi Watt changes three or four times.  Owen wears the same clothes and has the same one day beard throughout.  Who was in charge of continuity?  Uh!

860945,3,6304278691,"The International has a very simple plot.  Shady, corrupt bank and two law officials who try to bring it down. Clive Owen is an interpol agent and Naomi Watts is a assisant D.A. from New York. Everyone else in the huge cast are either villains, thugs, assassins, conspirators, but you keep asking yourself.....who was that?  When Clive Owens mortally wounds a killer on a Italian rooftop some guy with gun in hand walks up behind Clive Owen, walks by him and puts a bullet in the dying killers head, then turns to Clive Owen and says ""grazi"" and walks off.  Who was that?

Clive Owens follows a assassin into the Guggenheim Museum in NYC and suddenly a platoon of assassins appear out of nowhere and there is a rousing gun battle that is the only reason I gave this murky mess of a movie three stars.

So if you like movies where you have to ask, who was that? what was that?

The DVD extras are interesting too, including a general short on how it was made and a closer look at the behind the scenes of the most exciting part - a shoot out in the NY Guggenheim.",1247875200,,577,4.637254901960785
860947,4,6304278691,"""The International"" opens with a close-up of Clive Owen's bedraggled and unshaven face staring intently on a dodgy transaction that's taking place in a car park in the pouring rain across the street from him. As it cuts to his British colleague in a German car (played by an excellent Ian Burfield) negotiating the release of dangerous information from a nervous businessman in the driver's seat, you are immediately aware of a number of things - the stunning picture quality, the clever story and the cool cast. ""The International"" is beautiful to look at on BLU RAY and it's what you'd expect from a film like this - a well-paced espionage Bourne-like thriller that's both entertaining and striving to say something (though not always achieving either).

Roughly based on true events that rocked the banking system in the 80s and 90s, ""The International"" has been given a contemporary upgrade by Director TOM TYKWER and Writer ERIC SINGER - and in light of the avalanche of less-than-honest activities surrounding the recent global meltdown, it doesn't look the least bit out of place. In fact ""The International"" looks like it's arrived just in time - and with a really good point to make. Is it really the terrorists we need to be scared of - or the shady filth in suits that finance them? And what are their ultimate motives?

Clive Owen and Naomi Watts play Louis Salinger and Eleanor Whitman, two investigators from either side of the pond with a similar burning goal - for years they've been trying to expose a European bank they believe to be the number one choice for 90% of the world's dirty money. Toppling governments, controlling populations - it's a cesspool of hurt for ordinary people everywhere - and has clients said to include 'everyone' from Hezbollah to the CIA. But when Salinger and Whitman try to get close to an 'insider' who could give them a case, that person and their entire family gets removed by a no-loose-ends professional - and the agents subsequent investigations into the dead bodies then gets bogged down in endless amounts of convenient red tape and police bureaucracy.

After a while it becomes obvious that it's time to take chances, live dangerously and go outside the law. And on the movie goes to Istanbul and a newspaper collage in the end credits that depressingly reads more like the truth rather than fiction...

As you can imagine the cast is huge and the locations many. Keeping with buildings - the pristine yet detached architecture peppering so many affluent cities around the world especially in their financial sectors is used as a sort of subtext - as Agent Salinger climbs the steps of yet another sleek but soulless headquarters, he's little David making his way towards a mighty Goliath and with no real certainty that he's going to wound the beast, let alone kill the seemingly indestructible monster.

Owen is a great leading man if not too ludicrously handsome to be believable, while Watts is an actress of calm beauty and intelligence that most leading men would want to work with. Ulrich Thomas is superb as the intelligent yet clinically detached head of the shady bankers conglomerate that talk on laptops and meet in museums. Felix Silis and Jack McGee (the Chief in Rescue Me) turn up as low-level detectives in New York just doing their job with tenaciousness and heart, while Watts plays it straight throughout - a woman who is committed, but scared out of her wits for herself and her young family (the writing is thankfully too intelligent to set up the inevitable romance between her and the lead).

But the movie's secret weapon is Armin Mueller-Stahl. Stahl is the kind of actor who has monumental gravitas - he makes every sentence seem like an event - he's like Europe's acting equivalent of Anthony Hopkins. Armin plays Wilhelm Wexler - a man who exudes old-world power and corruption stretching back a lifetime. But Salinger detects something else in Wexler's advanced years - here is a once-principled man who started out with ideals and dreams, but has ended up defending a nightmare that kills real people in the real world and with sickening passionless detachment. There's a brilliantly written face-to-face showdown between Owen and Mueller-Stahl - a meeting of two minds - both of whom are tired of being beaten to a pulp by a huge lie. Wilhelm wants redemption - a way of making his life count - and perhaps both men are smart enough to work out a way of mutual interest.

The BLU RAY has a commentary by the Director that's fantastically detailed; there's a very interesting ""Making Of"" feature which has location footage in Berlin, New York, Istanbul, Milan and even a deserted warehouse in Germany where the spectacular Guggenheim Museum set was built for a huge shoot out between Salinger and the assassin he's trying to keep alive - the excellent Irish actor Brian F. O'Byrne.

If I was to put up a failing - it would be that there's too much style over substance - and you just don't care enough for the characters to have the movie make a real impact on you. And some of the shoot-outs border on the silly rather than the believable - put in there to up the action quotient and provide enticing trailer fodder. Or perhaps its just that the subject matter is frankly too real for most of us...and it's outcome too depressing...

For all that ""The International"" is an impressive and entertaining thriller - not great - but definitely worth a punt.

And could someone please give Clive Owen ugly tablets - it only seems fair to the rest of us mere mortals...",1247788800,,5551,4.778936392075078
860948,5,6304278691,"""The International""  is a swift-paced thriller with a great scene in a famous New York City building.  Interpol agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) are investigating an international bank, headquartered in Luxembourg, that is involved in a catalogue of illegal activities ranging from money laundering and arms trading to the backing of coups in unstable third-world countries.  Anyone who knows too much about the bank's operations and any law enforcement officer who gets close to digging up proof of the bank's clandestine activities are quickly eliminated by the bank's highly trained, lethal hit team.
 A highlight of the movie is a dazzlingly filmed shoot-out in Manhattan's Guggenheim Museum, which is staged spectacularly.  A key meeting at a climactic point in the film is to take place at the museum, and Salinger and his New York team are about to close in when all hell breaks loose and the art repository turns into a shooting gallery, with good guys, bad guys, and unknown guys with automatic weapons running up and down the museum's famous ramps as art patrons cringe, bullets fly, art is defaced, and blood splatters.  This is one of the best action sequences I've seen in a movie in many a moon.
 Blu-ray extras include deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, another featurette explaining how the Guggenheim sequence was planned and filmed, and director commentary.  A digital copy of the movie is included with the Blu-ray edition.",1247270400,,1520,5.1755102040816325

Be warned: Owens in no James Bond or Jason Bourne and Watts is no Bond girl. There was only one good action scene - a shoot-out in a musuem. The rest was tedious with confusing dialouge. I kept trying to rewind so I could understand what was going on - it never worked.

This movie is not a thriller, suspenseful or even a true action flick. It's just a mess - one I would return, if I could find my receipt!",1247184000,2,644,3.9844961240310077

861002,4,6304278691,"It seems to me that the story is based on real life bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) which was under investigation by several jurisdictions and had connections with terrorists.

The scope of the story is global, a fact which we are reminded of throughout the two hour film with constant images of large scale settings and buildings which dwarf the actors and the people in general. There is much symbolism and imagery throughout the movie, the gigantic scale and complexity representing global banking and finance, as well as the overarching power with multinational banks were able to exert over the developed nations through their recycling of petrodollars into loans for third world governments.

The complexities are also shown to work against national governments and international organisations who owe their ability to act to treaties which circumscribe their abilities to investigate such huge corporations yet which at the same time permit the same financial conglomerates to obscure their dealings to hide slush funds and expenditure on almost anything you like. The ability of the conglomerates to exert power and influence both across borders and within political and investigative agencies without any aparent restraint is highlighted. As it is there are links to Godfather III&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Part-III-The-Coppola-Restoration/dp/B0019L21H4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather Part III - The Coppola Restoration</a>&nbsp;with the imputation of a mafia or cosa nostra assassin at the conclusion of the story.

As for the actors and the plot this is a pretty strong cast. Clive Owen is a clever choice for a variety of reasons. For me the choice is most apt given Owens role in the television show Chancer where strangely enough the setting was also mainly in the finacial world&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chancer-Series-1/dp/B000P2A2WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chancer - Series 1</a>.

The story meanders a bit but there again, that in itself is not a negative aspect. In a way it fits in with the overall view of a global strategy like a huge chess puzzle only, like American ""Football"" where the pieces are people. The meandering and philosophical nature of the film also suggests slow and deliberate contemplation of moves and trying to win the war before it begins.

Overall I enjoyed the movie as a piece of cerebral entertainment though I suspect that for a lot of people they would rather have more action and more of the guy getting the girl. Oh well.",1245628800,,3034,5.9495412844036695
861003,5,6304278691,"The International really surprised me. It made no ripples in the theatres, very little press or fanfare, so I did not pay too much attention to it. Now it is on DVD and I am glad that I gave it a shot.
A few notes:
- Don't expect a whole bunch of car chases and gunfights, there is some action, but its not that kind of movie.
- ""Conspiracy Theory"" haters (sheep), keep watching Obama swatting flies and skip this movie, it will only scare and confuse you; unless you want to start waking up.

  This film is particularly salient now that everybody is losing their jobs and savings due to an accounting trick (""You owe 1 trillion dollars..""). The International is a great thriller because it uses reality as a basis for its fiction.

  Clive Owen plays an Interpol agent investigating the actions of an international banking cartel. Naturally, witnesses start dying and government officials start stonewalling - sounds alot like our SEC pals. The bank is getting involved in ""nation building"", also known as loading nations with debt then siphoning away all of their assets. Sound familiar?

  Anyway, besides being a textbook example of the global banker's playbook, the international has some great cinematography and some good acting. Well worth your time and $$. Get it before the hyper-inflation kicks in!",1245456000,4,1310,4.838565022421525

Our Interpol agent, Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) along with sidekick NYC DA Elenor Whitman (Naomi Watts) are woefully outsmarted at every turn by the powers to be when trying to bring the bank down. Then the movie suddenly gets interesting. It starts with the awesome extended gun battle in the Guggenheim Museum, where the story takes a revenge turn. Clive Owen was perfectly cast and gave a great performance - always angry at everything he can't control. Naomi Watts, besides being totally miscast, couldn't redeem her part with any acting skills - total fluff. Armin Mueller-Stahl, as the Ex-Communist bank intelligence consult, had some great scenes with Clive Owen during the last 30 minutes of the movie. The cinematography was outstanding - the travelogue shots, the action scenes, and close-ups of character's face. The script was really weak and not very dynamic - starts off interesting, quickly gets confusing, then finishes with no real conclusions of what really happened. Overall, the movie does hold your attention (I've seen many of those buildings), and the gunfight scene in the Guggenheim is worth the price admission alone.",1245456000,,1432,5.1239316239316235
861055,3,6304278691,"First off, to be fair to THE INTERNATIONAL, it is not a traditional thriller, nor is it a 'spy' movie like the Bourne trilogy. It is a political drama that borders on thriller; the sort of movie that is particularly salient in the troubled times we live in because of its careful attention to the multitude of gray areas that exist in global finance, world politics, and in the people operating in those systems. Not a simple pop-corn shoot-em up action flick (although the best part of the film is an extended and well designed gun battle in The Guggenheim Museum in NYC), THE INTERNATIONAL attempts to weave together an elaborate plot, a few complex and interesting characters and a classical film style into a hard edged and memorable film. I say attempts, because sadly, the true potential of the film is never quite realized.

The best elements include the brooding performance of Clive Owen, who from literally the opening shot demonstrates his formidable ability to convey the subtleties of negative emotion. He embodies frustration, desperation, and a tortured persistence against all odds. His acting is the best thing in the film, and will keep you engaged, even when there's very little happening on screen. Sadly, Naomi Watts' character isn't given much material to work with, and she appears to have mailed this one in--which I hardly blame her for, the character she's given to play is about as cardboard cut-out as they come. Lines like ""I just want to get the truth"" delivered with no conviction whatsoever feel jarring in an otherwise well acted film.

The complexities of the plot line, necessary though many of them may be, do not make the film that accessible, and don't always lead the viewer through the story in a seamless way. For example, there are a few major reveals that happen in the film that would be easily missed if the viewer is not paying close attention. I think that is where much of the ""I hated it"" criticism of the film originates; THE INTERNATIONAL is a film easily misunderstood--especially by those going into it expecting a typical Hollywood thriller.

Where the movie stumbles is in its ability to show the audience what the stakes are for anyone other than the protagonist; the audience hears about arms deals, dishonest behavior by the bank, sees murders and assassinations, and generally knows that the bank in question is quite morally corrupt. However, there is not a real sense of how those things tie together and what it means for the viewer. The threats posed by the bank are generally so ambiguous that its hard to relate to anything other than the immediate plight of the main character.

Putting this in context, I think about a movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-War/dp/B000EWBKK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of War</a>&nbsp;which despite its failings was able aptly capture what arms dealing does to a Third World country and allowed even a relatively uneducated westerner see why small arms sales really hurt people. Through intentionally complexity and by leaving many things in 'the gray area' THE INTERNATIONAL only obliquely touches on the real issues with multinational banks acting as para-states, and never creates much of a burden for the viewer to hate or fear them. The context is missing.

It is also increasingly hard to believe in the nemesis of a nearly omnipotent multinational corporation as a real threat. In the aftermath of watching the likes of AIG, GM, and other massive corporations fall apart at the seams, it makes at least this reviewer wonder about the plausibility of a corporation having the level of sophistication and length of reach of the one in this film. The specter of another 'evil machine' corporation maliciously pursuing its own agenda seems almost dated given current events.

Overall, this is an interesting movie with solid acting from Owen, a pleasing classical film style, and a remarkable action sequence. Sadly, the movie lacks real punch, and feels like it has bit off more than it can chew. It's worth renting, and possibly buying if you're an Owen fan, enjoy international politics, or just want to be able to watch and re-watch the shoot out at the Guggenheim Museum.

861061,4,6304278691,"""The International"" is not a typical action-packed thriller. The first half of the movie moves at a rather sedate pace, and does appear plodding in parts, but this is necessary to get the action going in the latter half of the movie. The theme explored in the movie is very much in tune with present times, given the collapse of major financial institutions worldwide.

Clive Owen plays Interpol Agent Louis Salinger, and Naomi Watts plays NY Asst DA Eleanor Whitman, who are both investigating the sinister and illegal dealings of an international banking corporation, the IBBC.  The first half of the movie spends much time, a lot of which is dialogue-driven, delving into what the IBBC is about and why the bank is being investigated. The story arcs do get a bit confusing at times, as there are many facets to the bank's operations.

The middle part of the movie focuses on an IBBC hitman [who offs those the IBBC deems a threat to their operations], with the action moving from one city to another. This includes a well-executed action sequence at the Guggenheim Museum which is the highlight of the movie. The final part of the movie shifts back into slow gear as the setting moves from NY to Turkey. Salinger with the help of an informant tries his best to put an end to the IBBC's illegal dealings, but there are a couple of plot twists here that require careful attention. The ending does make you think and try to link the previous story arcs in order to understand what exactly is going on, but it's really not that hard to figure out.

Clive Owen is credible as the determined Interpol Agent, and Watts is average [she doesnt really get the chance to flex her acting chops here like she did in 21 Grams]. I particularly liked the supporting role played by Armin Muehller-Stahl [one of my favorite actors] as one of the main reps of the IBBC.

This movie is not for the die-hard action fan, but if you like cerebral thrillers, this may just be your cup of tea.",1244851200,3,1971,4.572237960339943

861064,5,6304278691,"""The International"" is a good and honest movie. Hollywood generally doesn't release movies that are fairly original and intellectually respectful to the audience. The story deals with world bank corruption and how it's not the money that motivates them, but rather the power of enslaving nations and people with debt. If you know anything about the fractional reserve system of current banking, then this movie makes a lot of sense. I am surprised that Hollywood would release a movie like this.

The movie doesn't try to be more then it is. It does, however, take the audience on a journey to explain how the current economic situation could possibly be manipulated. The movie does follow some cliches, but I felt they were handled in original and artistic ways. The Guggenheim scene was very interesting and an original place to stage a Hollywood shootout. The story from start to finish is solid and easy to follow.  There were no huge plot twists, however the character resolutions have their complexities and the finale is a little peculiar, but still gratifying and complete.

Clive Owen gives a wonderful and believable performance as a man over the edge and determined to expose the truth of this cloak and dagger organization. Naomi Watts does a good job as a supporting character and doesn't get in the way of the story, but she amplifies it when necessary.

I greatly enjoyed this movie. I skipped seeing it at the theater because it looked a little long, but after watching it on DVD my worries that the plot would be thin were put to rest. The story keeps the flow going and the audience interested the whole time.",1244592000,68,1627,4.8
861124,2,6304278691,"Muddled plot and wooden acting by the leads aside, the movie does look fantastic on Blu Ray, reference quality picture.  Its beautiful.  But under the surface of that beauty, is nothing.  Clive Owens is Clive Owens. There is nothing new in his performance.  Its the same as every other movie he has been in since Bourne Identity.  Naomi Woods has a throw away role. The studio could have saved money with a lesser known actress.  The dozen or so supporting actors save the movie, making it watchable,  but the story isn't engaging.  You don't care about the good or bad guys.  You just wait for the next pretty location shot. There is a  blip of hope in the middle that makes you think this shouldn't have been a box office failure.  That feeling of hope doesn't last.  Save your money.",1244505600,2,786,4.535714285714286
861125,4,6304278691,"Hundreds of movies are billed as taken straight from today's headlines. Most are several months behind rather than current. THE INTERNATIONAL lives up to that idea and seems to have come along right as things are heating up.

Clive Owen stars as Louis Salinger, an Interpol agent whose partner is meeting a high level operative within the International Bank of Business & Credit (IBBC). The man has just informed them of the bank's intention to purchase nuclear missiles to sell to the Chinese. As he leaves the meet, Salinger's partner grasps his arm and apparently has a heart attack.

All, as they say, is not as it seems though. It turns out he was poisoned inconspicuously by an assassin working for IBBC in an attempt to stop this investigation. Instead it spurs Salinger on to dig deeper and go further. With the help of a New York assistant DA named Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts), the investigation moves forward as they attempt to follow up with this information. The players are identified and now, with the original whistle blower murdered as well, they just need someone on the inside to confirm their suspicions.

As Salinger finds discrepancies in the testimony of the banks head concerning the death of the mole, he follows up the lead only to discover that the police report taken has been changed. It seems that the bank is all powerful and can even purchase the police for the right price.

After Salinger meets with his boss and alerts him to their homes being bugged, they decide to discuss a new line of attack with Whitman. She contacts the widow of the mole who leads them to another man, Calvini. Calvini is a politician and businessman who informs them IBBC was trying to purchase a guidance system from him for their missiles being sold to the Chinese. Without the system, the missiles cannot reach their intended targets and are worthless. Moments after speaking with them, Calvini is assassinated himself.

The clues point to a cover up again as the trajectory of the bullets that hit a column near Calvini came from two different angles. At that spot, they find an unusual footprint, one made by a false foot. Although the detective aiding Salinger and Whitman wants the truth, his superior pulls them off the case and orders them to leave. At the airport Whitman notices the security cameras and realizes they might be able to find the assassin, watching for a man with a false leg going through security.

Using this information and noting the specially made shoe used by the assassin, they track him down to New York. After witnessing him meet his contact from IBBC, Salinger approaches him with the aid of 2 local NYPD detectives. A gun battle in the Guggenheim Museum ensues leaving the assassin mortally wounded and Salinger attempting to escape.

Before the killer dies, he passes along a small piece of information that helps Salinger. That, along with a bit of illegal questioning Salinger uses on the man who met the killer, leads him to one conclusion. The only way to bring down IBBC and their illegal activities is if he goes off radar and does things in as illegal a mode as they do.

Trust me when I say that this film is much deeper than what I have been able to describe here in a few words. The level of conspiracy used in this film is so deep it's as if the threads weave in and out of one another with ease leaving a pretty picture while at the same time a distorted view of the world. Banks have become conglomerates just as portrayed here, but to what extent they will go and who they will do business with is anyone's guess.

Many believe that the Federal Reserve works much like this, attempting to make policy or change the world order, inserting rulers in countries in an attempt at control. Others believe it goes much deeper. While these are little more than theories, they do make one question what is going on in the world and films like this will no doubt fuel that fire.

Owen shows once more that he is becoming an action star worth watching. His tired looks throughout the film show the world weary man who wants justice but finds little. And while his character is not supposed to handle a gun (Interpol is supposed to be an information gathering organization only), he certainly finds the time to use one when needed. Watts does a commendable job as well though her top billing seems odd for such a small part. While essential to the story, the role is short on screen time. She does hold up well though.

If you're a conspiracy buff, if you think that there are more people in control of the world than politicians and rulers, then you'll like this film. Stick with it though and don't break away too often. Its story is as complicated as you might expect. And it offers an ending that may take you by surprise.",1244505600,4,4777,4.614840989399293
861126,4,6304278691,"This is, indeed, one of the best Blu-Ray transfers you'll see at this point-and-time.  I can't imagine it getting any sharper.  Scene after scene left me amazed at the clarity of the picture.  It makes this film fun to watch because the story is so-so, decent but nothing spectacular.

What is spectacular is the scenery, some excellent close-ups and overhead shots, and one action scene in particular: a shootout at the Guggenheim Art Museum in New York City that will get your attention! It reminded me of the dramatic shootout scene in the streets of Los Angeles in the 1995 movie ""Heat.""  This scene was just as intense. The sound of all the bullets - and there are hundreds in this scene - going from speaker-to-speaker was very cool, too.

The acting here was good. No complaints there, except Naomi Watts looked out of place in this story. It's a man's story and would have a been more credible with her role being filled by another tough guy like the Clive Owen played here. (Hey, some movies are man's movies and some are women's flicks.)

Whatever, if you want to see just how good a Blu-Ray transfer can look, check out this disc.",1244505600,7,1141,4.5911330049261085
861127,4,6304278691,"I think The International was a great film mainly because Clive Owen and the actors surrounding him acted greatly throughout the film. I enjoyed the dialouge and the special effects. There was really only one down fall to this movie but the downfall is what really makes this film either good or bad for audiences and that is that there is only really a couple of high action scenes in the movie. The first is the one where Clive Owen has this insanely awesome gun battle in a museum and the second contains a lot of dialouge but is interesting and intense and that is the scene were Clive Owen manages to kill one of the main bad guys in the film (Which doesn't really happen until the very end). I liked this film because it was interesting and the few action scenes made it flow BUT what I really didn't like about this movie is that its very slow moving in action and it takes quite awhile to get to the good parts. I wouldn't say this is a full on action packed, shoot em up bang bang movie but if your looking for a movie that you want to focus in on with a few gun shots here and there I think you will enjoy it. Overall the movie was great but could of included at least a few more action scenes then it did but the few action scenes that it did include sure make up for it in some big ways.",1244505600,2,1299,4.098039215686274
861128,5,6304278691,"Reviews have been quite mixed on the content and quality of this film, but without a doubt this Blu is an excellent piece for the those seeking competent clarity, BD production and special features. The film offers a mixed bag and is understandably panned for the later acts ""bogging down"" or a confusion as to what kind of film it is trying to be, but in the end - I was impressed by a thoughtful and well preserved product.

The picture is reference quality throughout. The landscapes, architecture, streets, wide overhead pans, rooftop panoramas, and nighttime depth all shined in clarity, aspect and colors. Customers were very impressed with certain scenes that captured the international buildings.

The sound is 5.1 TrueHD, which gets used extensively on the score and singular long shooting sequence, but little else to speak of there (I am a big DTS fan).

The special features are what make this package a five star, even if you rate this film as low as a three.

- An extended scene between our two leads; an eleven minute sequence that orginally ran much less (just prior to the scene where he dunks his head in the ice water).

- A thirty minute making-of that thoroughly covered all aspects of filming. Interestingly, it covered the production in sequence with how the film was released (beginning to end). The next two features should have been included but were separated into:

  ** a six minute architecture documentary about the locations, and a seven minute addendum about shooting at the Guggenheim (pun intended) that was better covered in the main documentary; it almost felt like a snippet that played on a network or ad plug.

- A five minute insight about filming being allowed for the first time at the Autostadt factory for VW. An impressive place.

- The picture in picture looks pristine but for the amount of dialogue it works better on the second go around. Once again, you have to have your player dialed perfectly for it to work completely. Same with having everything up to date for the Cinechat feature.

As far as the rest of the package goes, the commentary is very similar to what we see in the documentaries, and can be subtitled in Spanish and Portugese. The menu navigates well and contains my favorite of the chapter selection designs. That being where the entire time line is shown on one page complete with pics and time graph.

A worthwhile owner for fans of the film, and an adequate rental for those that are interested in the background and filming locales.",1244073600,18,2506,4.748847926267281
861129,4,6304278691,"I saw ""The Inernational"" In February when at that time of the year is the time for the trow away movies, but this is not.  This is a great thriller and the scene in the Musucum is one of the best shot out ever put on film.
I am a avid fan of Clive Owen and I hope he contiunes in this vain. I am going to get the movie when it becomes available on June 9, 2009.",1243468800,3,361,3.628205128205128
861130,4,6304278691,"The International will appeal to those who like plot driven films.  The basic premise is that of an interpol agent who's frustrated by the lack of autonomy in delivering justice and trapped in a world of corporate corruption - well, he doesn't quite turn Clint Eastwood if that's the movie you're looking for.

Still the International makes for a fascinating enough experience.  I enjoyed this (and I am neither a Clive Owen and Naomi Watts fan) because I wanted to see how it would play out.  Would the big bad bank win?  Would Clive exact revenge?  etc - There were many possible scenarios that this could have played out - and it's only fault perhaps is not deepening the suspense enough and going the Film Noir route,  although all the ingredients of a thriller are certainly present.  At least it tries to be more unique than some other movies.  For that, I give it an A for effort and B+ for execution.

Timing has been a good factor for the film as mentioned - since corporate greed is on the loose, and banks it seems are bankrupting the world...this is not a deep treatise on that sort of thing, but it certainly resonates with the audience!

I'm hoping that the DVD will have extended scenes, which will possibly heighten the intrigue...this is a movie that could have snaked a little bit more and kept us gripped to our seats.  Obviously it didn't work for everyone, but as long as you buy that banks are the bad guys...then you'll be fine.  Otherwise, go check out North by Northwest with Cary Grant!",1241827200,2,1512,4.555555555555555
861131,2,6304278691,"The International

  Timing is everything, and this one truth just might be a saving grace for The International. The theme of the film: corruption of bank and government officials, correlates with the growing scrutiny of financial institutions.

  Taking a page or two from the local papers, The International, released February 13, 2009, explores the crumbling empire and corrupt enterprises of banking on a global scale. Its focus, the International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC) has even more devastating investments than Wall Street. Rather than simply over-extending consumers and undermining their livelihood, the IBBC is funding terrorism.

When consulting with General Charles Motomba (Lucian Msamati), leader of a liberation movement in Liberia, the IBBC assures the General that their limited financial means will not inhibit their ability to attain weapons and ammunition because, ""Money is not this institution's primary medium of exchange."" It appears the IBBC is more interested in facilitating the spread of terrorism, war and death than money. Jonas Skarssen (Ulrich Thomsen) is a member of the board of the IBBC and his personal motto helps keep the bank unstoppable in its endeavors. He believes ""if there is no way out, the best thing to do is to find a way further in.""

  Fueling feelings of distrust in the banking industry, The International follows Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) of Interpol as he collaborates with Manhattan's Assistant District Attorney, Eleanor Whitaker (Naomi Watts), in a slow, methodical effort to take down the corrupt financial enterprise that is the IBBC. Clive Owen plays the role of Agent Salinger as an unfeeling, autonomous agent whose superiors are impotent in restraining him. Commissioner Villon (Laurent Spielvogel) pretends to end Agent Salinger's investigation into the IBBC and leash him to his desk.

  Regardless of his superior's irritation, Salinger travels abroad and within New York to apprehend a suspect that will lead to the IBBC's undoing. The International takes a budgeted, methodical look at international policing while avoiding scenes of intense action. Instead, The International allocates its budget to one beautifully devastating attack on a recreation of the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The delicate, graceful structure of the museum is shattered as the Guggenheim is eviscerated of every essence of art and culture.

The lack of action outside of this scene saves Clive Owen from feigning emotion with each death, since he fails so bitterly to appear interested, or even aware, when a car in Berlin strikes A.D.A. Eleanor Whitaker. How might one convey a growing body count with minimal action, especially when contact with Agent Salinger precipitates death? Director Tom Tykwer relays each death using newspaper articles and police reports, each orated by the dry, embittered voice of Agent Salinger.

  The way in which the cinematography is fragmented allows Agent Salinger to be present without allowing analysis of his acting. Throughout the film, choppy editing makes The International uncomfortable to watch. Even conversations are awkward because tight shots of the speaker's and listener's faces alternate. Rather than combining both actors in the same visual field, the audience is forced to play a mental tennis match between subjects. The use of wide shots to establish location were very limited, often making Salinger the focus instead of the gloomy landscapes of Britain, Berlin, Luxembourg, and New York.

  Unity for this film exists in one primary element which is often overlooked: the music. The music director did not score periods of the film in which the actors are speaking. The original score is very metronomic, featuring a rhythmic score composed primarily of drum beats and percussion for the first 45 minutes that transitions into recognizable tension-building techniques that use piano and violin in short, repetitive score sections. Not having to compete to hear the dialogue is always nice, but in The International it simply failed to distract from the uncomfortable phrasing spoken by the authors.

  Clive Owen is responsible for many of the disjointed lines spoken. Perhaps someone should inform the writer, Eric Singer, that interrupting phrases and clauses with ""which"" and ""what"" does not make the dialogue British. Clive Owen takes this opportunity as Agent Salinger to stumble over dialogue, including, ""We cannot control what life happens to us."" ""Sometimes the hardest thing to know in life is which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn"" can also be accredited to Owen as uncomfortably spoken, but memorable.

  Flaws considered, this slow-moving ""thriller"" builds a case against the IBBC that could strike terror into the hearts of its audience if only that metronomic beat weren't keeping tickers at a steady rhythm. The film definitely places a focus on timing; perhaps Tykwer knew that the films relevance would be its only chance for redemption.

I'd give a Short Attention Span Summary, but this would be hard to do for two reasons: 1) It was all I could do to stay awake through a first viewing of the movie; 2) It would take a second viewing to try to put together all the convoluted chracters, and I just don't have any masochistic tendencies.

What else? The cinematography was pretty decent, and the acting was also believable. But the movie overall just didn't have enough well directed plot to keep anyone interested.

861133,3,6304278691,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Clive Owen plays a grungy Interpol agent trying to bring down an unscrupulous bank, but keeps running into dead ends - literally.
2. Naomi Watts barely registers as an Assistant District Attorney who also wants to bring the offending bank to justice.
3. If you're looking for nookie, skip this one altogether
4. Stunning visual tour of the architecture of Berlin, Milan, the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the rooftops of Istanbul is interrupted by a silly plot about a crooked bank.
5. They should have stuck to the architecture

This is a forgettable movie despite the casting of Owen and Watts, with a plot that meanders all over the place to prove that nothing ever changes when it comes to the lust for power.
