663938,3,6303481302,"This DVD was good, but compared to other Cirque shows like Quidam and Dralion it seems a bit rough.  The DVD was very dark at times making the artists hard to see and the single spotlight in the back was distracting.  If you are a Cirque collecter than this is for you, if you are a novice Cirque fan I recommend one of their later shows like Quidam or Dralion.",1017964800,13,361,4.142857142857143
663939,4,6303481302,"This DVD has more acts to it than the Bravo TV special, and it's worth the purchase.  Although some of the acts doesn't ""wow"" me like newer shows, they are better than ""Cirque Reinvente"", and the music is very nice.  My favorite part is the ""Film Scene"" where one of the clowns acts out an old time movie with three audience members.  Two complaints about the disc is that the video is dark at times, and the only extras are trailers for other Cirque DVDs.  I wish there was a behind-the-scenes look, but there isn't.",1006128000,5,517,4.410526315789474
663940,5,6303481302,"My wife and I do not remember having laughed that much in our life! The clown-director act is perfect. Either improvised or rehearsed, it cannot be more funny. Unfortunately we saw it on  TV not having time to tape it...",965347200,3,220,4.5
663941,5,6303481302,"Nouvelle Experience was the first Cirque show I ever saw live (I've seen a total of 4 now). My wife and I were totally amazed at the spectacle of the show. We new (from newspaper reviews) that it was a ""new kind of  circus"", but I think that definition is terribly lacking.
The video  does a good job of capturing some of the excitement of the live show. The  acts are covered well, with the execption of a couple of the arial acts  where the stage lighting causes annoying flares in the camera.
I always  recommend that people go see a Cirque show live before they see the video.  Unfortunately, Cirque is no longer doing this show live. This video is a  good reminder of what you experienced in the theater, but it is no  substitute for sitting in the dark in sheer wonder.",953856000,2,775,4.333333333333333
663942,5,6303481302,"Typical of cirque du soleil, this show contains performances that make your jaw gape. The opening act of four girls who contort and balance, with or without each other, is so incredible you can't not react. Next, a group  of acrobats uses a see-saw to fling themselves four thousand feet in the  air while doing six hundred twisting flips in a micro-second to land on  human stacks, the other end of the see-saw, or anywhere else they want to  land...and precisely. The next routine allows viewers some down-time while  a girl floats east and west on a giant swing while winding her body through  all shapes to the accompaniment of peaceful music.  Next comes the guy who  does stuff on a tightrope that cannot be done, while  the elderly director  provides comic relief as he tries to mimic, and mostly unsuccessfully, his  moves. I will not go through all the acts, but I have to warn you about  what happens to you after watching the oriental girls who use their feet to  do tricks with umbrellas: the little section of flesh between your eyebrows  will be sore if you do not try to unfurrow them some time during the act.  With all this praise it may come as a surprise to know this is my least  favorite cirque du soleil show. I have four of their videos and I rate this  one five stars because it deserves it. It's just that Quidam deserves a  hundred. The other shows fall somewhere in between. If this is your thing,  you will not be disappointed with any of them and I strongly recommend you  buy them all. Oh, and be ready to laugh. You'll be doing a lot of it.",952646400,30,1571,4.407665505226481
663943,5,6303481302,"After seeing the videos of  'Quidam' (unbelievable) and 'Saltimbanco' (good, but does not compare to 'Quidam'), I expected to be disappointed.  Leave it to Cirque du Soleil to not allow my expected disappointment.  'Nouvelle Experience' seems to be an ancestor to 'Mystere' which I have  seen twice and will see every time I visit Las Vegas.  The high bar and  trampoline and 'see-saw' acts can be found in 'Mystere' and are just as  thrilling in this video from 1991.  As always, the spellbinding music of  Rene Dupre enhances the performances.  The highlight, in my opinion, is the  hilarious clown 'director' scene with audience participation.  I had to  pause the tape several times until I quit laughing.  Cirque du Soleil, et  al. IS the most incredible entertainment force on Earth!",949881600,11,789,5.007751937984496
664061,1,6303481302,Lighting TERRIBLE! Very disappointed in the filming for this DVD! What were the filmmakers of the Cirque du Soleil thinking! The lighting was way to dark.

664069,4,6303481302,"You have to remember that this was not filmed for DVD. This show was filmed for VHS and was released first on VHS in 1991. So that's why it looks kind of dark and has not that many angles. The show is excellent. An earlier review mentioned there being a ""high bar"" act in this show, but there isn't. This DVD is great to have because this show is no longer performed live. All of the music from the great CD is in this live recording. I had seen ""Nouvelle Experience"" live, three times and this is the best version of it.",1098489600,3,521,4.117647058823529
