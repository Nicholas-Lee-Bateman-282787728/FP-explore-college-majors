2533427,5,B000ESSTJM,The DVD has more video than advertised. Just when we were done watching one we found another set of videos not mentioned and now find a complete and thorough guide with walk thru How to`s. I would buy again if this were somehow lost. Excellent and for the average Joe.,1234915200,14,268,4.38
2533428,4,B000ESSTJM,"As a visual learner, and cautious person in general, I've been hesitant to really get inside an amp to replace components, even after reading all about how to do it on web forums and books.

Combining the 'book' knowledge I've gained, with actually being able to see Gerald at work in this dvd, I have much more confidence in my personal safety and ability to perform basic work on my amps.

This is a logically indexed and fascinating collection of Gerald's videos that completely takes the mystery out of questions like ""How EXACTLY do I measure voltage on a live amp?"" and ""How EXACTLY does one safely discharge a filter capacitor?"" for a beginner like me.  There are also advanced topics for those that can perform the basics half-drunk with their eyes closed.

Gerald is a controversial figure in the guitar and amp world of big egos and names, and ""who knows the most tube theory"", but I appreciate the knowledge of old Fender and Marshalls that he shares in this dvd.  Worth the price of admission to me.",1173312000,35,1011,4.625698324022347
2533429,5,B000ESSTJM,"This DVD will give you the right tools to service and repair tube amps and vintage amps.  Walking through the processes step by step, this DVD will help you maintain or restore any amp.",1143158400,5,185,4.4411764705882355
8113929,5,B000ESSTJM,"This is a good collection of 3 different technical videos done at different times. You may have caught some of this information on You Tube if you were looking on-line for tube data or videos. All of these have very good information. Gerald uses the Fender series amps a lot as examples, but this is not a big issue. If you can understand the simple circuits that Leo Fender used in his gear, then you will be more prepared to figure out the same things going on in Marshall, Ampeg and numerous other amplifiers. Just like Gerald tells you in one of his other videos, all tube amps are basically the same. Understanding the principles and the 4 major parts of tube amps is a huge step in moving forward towards actually doing some troubleshooting and rebuilding. These videos all have excellent material put forward in a concise and easy to follow manner. There are a few very humorous out-takes at the end of each video. One video in which Gerald would seem to get shocked is actually a put on, and you see that in the out-take. However, in another video out-take, he actually does receive a shock which must have really belted him. So beware, live amps can even bite the pro's. There are good safety considerations explained and shown, and the inevitable disclaimer, but with good reason. If you don't know what you're doing, the voltages in these amps can kill. These videos are worth having and watching several times, and they have good information you will want to keep as a reference. How to convert a Silverface Fender to Blackface spec's is great stuff to know. Gerald shows how it's done in one of these videos. The list price on this is a bit out of reach for some, I realize. However, you can find these used but in good condition. I was fortunate to find mine as a brand new disc at a greatly reduced price, so they're out there if the regular price scares you. If you want to actually see how things are done rather than just read about them in his books, then get these videos. They're not Oscar winners, but they're still well done.",1464652800,2,2048,4.493297587131368
8113930,5,B000ESSTJM,I like the way this gentleman lays out the information. I have a background in electronics from years ago and his videos fills in the gaps.,1441411200,,139,4.384615384615385

8113932,3,B000ESSTJM,Good guide and information.,1414108800,,27,6.0
8113933,5,B000ESSTJM,great book to have a good understanding of how a tube amp works. There is great detail in how some amps works and the reasons your tone maybe not as good as you would expect. The simple things that can be causing your amp to lose its tone over time and the process to restore the tone. Gerald is one of the best tube amp guys in the world.,1396483200,,339,3.927536231884058
8113934,3,B000ESSTJM,"Fairly simplistic and a good start for those thinking about tweaking or restoring their own gear.
The details are always given in advice to get his books and not shown on this video.
Glad I didn't pay full price !",1391299200,,213,4.35
8113935,5,B000ESSTJM,"compiles all of his previous recording into one dvd.  great hands on examples.  does not cover everything, but if you already own his books this is a good video to go along with them.",1371772800,,183,4.352941176470588
8113936,5,B000ESSTJM,"If you work on tube guitar amps this video may be a helpful addition to your library.  There are helpful insights for beginners, especially if you've never seen the insides of an amp.  Mr. Weber's personal experiences and insights may be helpful to intermediate and advanced builders.  It's fun to watch.",1363737600,2,304,4.921568627450981
8113937,5,B000ESSTJM,"I'm re-capping and blackfacing my Twin. This is my first experience with tube-amp wiring. I would say, if you are new to tube amp circuits, then this video is a must-have. As another guy said, it's more video than advertised -- it has three large sections so in my estimation, it's worth the money. As yet another reviewer said, watching him is a great-confidence builder and that alone for me is worth the money. On top of it all, I picked up a few tips that I'd not found through my research or other reading, for example, he suggests specific values for the power filter caps to maximize tone. And on top of it all, the dude is cool to hang out with and listen to him while he is working. He's kinda funny and entertaining without trying to be. Notice something. No one ever says anything ill of the man. And folks in opinion forums can be... well, very prickly. The guy and his opinion is respected to be sure.",1314489600,5,914,4.350877192982456
8113938,2,B000ESSTJM,"Why do people who write books about amps think that I want to know what a transformer even looks like? I just want to to make the best tone I possibly can with my amp without taking the chassis out. And coming from a guy who has the funniest you tube video shocking himself, while explaining to be careful not to be shocked... I have to admit that didn't finish watching the entire video. This was given to me as a gift and I should have returned it for an amazon refund before I took off the shrink wrap. But the cover is impressive. And Gerald seems like a really nice guy.",1287446400,,575,4.142857142857143
