8099403,4,B000CNDJNU,"I think the previous reviewer really checked his brain at the door when viewing this fascinating film.  I had no idea what to expect when I slipped it into my DVD player, but boy was this was beyond my expectations.  This is the least ""movie"" like film I have ever seen.  It plays with time, dealing with pasts, presents, and futures within each scene, leaving the viewer never sure as to what place on the timeline they are viewing.  This intrigued me.  It seemed to me, the first time I can recall film capturing what it relly is like to exist.  None of us can recall every second of our day in chronological order - it remains fragmented moments.  I will refer to the previous reviewer's complaints about the bus scene.  I've taken many long distance busrides in my time, and this is exactly what it is like.  A series of nod offs and blackouts, where seemingly nothing happens.  Brilliant.

Another strong aspect of the film is the cinematography.  This is one of the better looking films in recent years, and given its absurdly low budegt, I think it deserves even more credit for looking as fanstastic as it does.  The strak black and white compositions recall Caligari, Alphaville, Carnival Of Souls, and Eraserhead.

Plotwise, the movie is very vague, and I would surmise that was the point.  This isn't a movie that even wants to tell you a story.  Sure there is a plot there, but it is superficial.  Again, I point to reality - our lives are not plots.  We do not wake up, and go to bed with every loose end tied up nicely as our head hits the pillows.  Some things will never be resolved.

Overall I would say this is a great first effort from the director, and I cannot wait to see what he does next.",1145836800,,1712,4.426282051282051
8099404,1,B000CNDJNU,"The somnambulist shorts of the underground movement could be compared to ""The Eternal Present,"" except that the shorts rarely ran more than 15 minutes and TEP goes feature length. The hero is a dork with a bad haircut who walks around with his mouth open. The jump cuts and eternity of black leader is sure to put you in a bad mood within minutes. In one scene, Our Hero is taking a bus ride, sitting and looking out of the window. This is covered in ten jump cuts and three fades to black! And nothing happens! There may be a plot here, but I am certainly not going to watch it again to find out. The film's credits include the film splicers our Artiste used! Do not buy this film, whatever your curiosity level. It has nothing to do with the plot synopsis offered on this web site.",1145750400,,783,4.297297297297297
