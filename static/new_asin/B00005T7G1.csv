Following every game play by play, every week, they made it to the superbowl. But could they win it? I knew they would, they have heart, something alot of teams lack nowadays. Not only is my favorite band U2 on this dvd, my favorite team, The New England Patriots, are the highlight, and the champions.",1014163200,2,405,4.2727272727272725

1660817,5,B00005T7G1,"I read about this video coming out last night, and just have to own it. The DVD will include game highlights and behind the scenes interviews; a chronicle of the Patriots season; a ""NFL Salutes America"" segment, the U2 halftime show will be on the DVD only as well as some of the pre-game entertainment.
Pre-orders are supposedly the highest ever in the 8 years that NFL films has been producing these. Probably due to the fact that it was the best Superbowl in a long time!",1013731200,3,474,4.459770114942529

1660857,5,B00005T7G1,"This DVD is great!!! I would most of the time be watching the post season such as when the Patriots beat the Rams in the Superbowl. The Superbowl of '01 season took place in Louisana Superdome.
The Patriots beat the Colts twice in 2001, I remember the Patriots use to play agianst the Colts twice a year.

The NFC teams the New England Patriots were against during 2001 season:
Away  Home
-Atlanta Falcons  11/4/2001  - St. Louis Rams 11/18/2001
-Carolina Panthers 1/6/2002  - New Orleans Saints 11/25/2001

When the Patriots beat the Rams, The Rams were suppose to win because they were tougher than the Patriots. Actually the Patriots won the Superbowl. The Patriots might've ended up playing better than how they did during the season, the Patriots played okay at the beginning of the 2001 season.

In the past before 2002, the Patriots didn't do well expect for when they beat the Colts twice such as in 1990.

This when the Patriots won the Superbowl for the first time.

The most important game of this DVD is the Superbowl.",1262476800,,1030,4.677777777777778
1660858,2,B00005T7G1,"I was looking for a DVD of Superbowl XXXVI. The description of this DVD gave the impression that it contained the whole game. Instead, it gave a recap of the season with footage of numerous games and about 10 min. of the superbowl. This was not what I wanted and was very disappointing.",1235088000,,286,4.415094339622642

That all changed in New Orleans 2001 and what a feeling that was. WE FINALLY WIN !!!! sadly this incredible moment of glory and joy is not commemorated very well on this DVD. It's far too short for starters and there isn't full coverage of the superbowl. why?! I know it was a dull game but we still won our first superbowl ever. Why not the full game play by play? I also found the music pretty irritating and the extra's were minimal and lousy. If you were lucky enough to have taped the game as it was on TV that night, stick to that and don't waste your money on this trash.",1174435200,2,729,4.251798561151079
1660886,4,B00005T7G1,"New England Patriots fans will no doubt want to add this Super Bowl XXXVI DVD to their collection. This highlights package of the 2001 NFL football season culminated in the Patriots winning their first league championship under difficult circumstances.

As with all other NFL championship DVDs, this is a little over an hour long highlights package of every New England Patriots regular season and playoff game, along with even more extensive highlights of the New England Patriots exciting, dramatic victory over the St. Louis Rams, 20-17, in Super Bowl XXXXVI.

This video includes many interviews, sideline sound bites, and locker room scenes throughout the season, which really brings to life the players and coaches on this fabulous team.

While I always feel these video packages do not do a great job of highlighting the drama of specific games, including those in the playoffs, it does do a good of job of conveying the drama of this very interesting, unusual season for the Patriots.

First, many may forget the Patriots started out 0-2, and were only 5-5 at one point in the season. Few expected this team to go far, especially not to the Super Bowl.

Probably more important, the producers of this video did a very nice job of dealing with the quarterback controversy--or lack thereof--that emerged when Tom Brady took over for the injured Drew Bledsoe, the long time New England starter. Bledsoe suffered a severe chest injury in the second regular season game against the Jets.  Once Bledsoe was cleared to play later in the season, Brady kept the starting job because the Patriots were winning and Brady was on a roll. This DVD includes in season interviews with both quarterbacks talking about their situation.  While there was a lot more tension on the team than is seen in the video or that the Patriots have ever made public, Bledsoe must be given great credit for not tearing the team apart and ruining their chances of success.  Given his long tenure as the starter and close relationship with the players on the team, he could have easily caused great dissension on the team and split apart the locker room.  But he accepted his new role with professionalism, maturity, and dignity which should endear him to most Patriots fans. Bledsoe earned his Super Bowl ring through his maturity and his great play in the AFC Championship game against Pittsburgh when Brady twisted his ankle early in the game.  This video does a nice job of highlighting and dealing with situation as the season progressed.

The video also does a nice job with the more extensive highlights of New England's playoff victories. The first, against the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Divisional Playoff game, 16-13, took place in a blizzard.  This game featured the overturning of an apparent Brady fumble, under the now infamous ""Tuck Rule,"" that would have cost the Patriots the game.  The game also featured some of the most amazing kicking in ridiculously bad weather by Adam Vinateri.

The Patriots 24-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Pittsburgh featured sterling play by Bledsoe when Tom Brady went down with an injury early in the game, and a Troy Brown return of a blocked field goal that help seal the game for the Patriots.

Finally, of course, there are even more extensive highlights of the dramatic 20-17 Super Bowl victory over the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI on a last second field goal by Adam Vinateri.  This was preceded by a gutsy, long drive by the Patriots with less than two minutes to go after the Rams tied the score late in the game. I still get tears in my eyes watching that kick sail through the uprights to secure our first Super Bowl victory.

The Special Features on the video are also nicely done. While I was disappointed the entire Super Bowl game was not on the video, the bonus material is quite worthwhile, even if the segments are a bit short.

The bonus features include ""NFL Salutes America,"" showing player reactions to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as well as the halftime show, featuring U2, which I frankly have never watched.

More interesting, and important to New England fans, are the three short segments about the team itself (about five minutes a piece). First, there is a segment on the 1976 Patriots, which many consider to be the most talented Patriots team ever, which was robbed in a playoff loss against the Oakland Raiders on a bogus roughing the passer call late in the game.

A second features one of New England's star players of the 1960s, Gino Cappelletti, who is now a broadcaster for Patriots game. And my favorite segment of all is on the tough, gritty Steve Grogan, the Patriots quarterback in the 1970s who was a role model for me as kid.

This video is highly recommend for New England Patriots fans.

Disclaimer: I am a die hard New England Patriots fan and am totally biased in this review.",1148342400,,4876,4.786650774731823
1660887,4,B00005T7G1,"If you are a Patriots fan there is no way you cannot enjoy this DVD reliving the magical 2001 season, the ""Snow Game"", and Super Bowl XXXVI.

The only problem I have with this DVD is it's too short -- every Super Bowl DVD after this one has hours of footage instead of just an hour but you will NOT be disappointed with what is on this disc!!

**** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1118275200,,367,4.154929577464789
1660888,4,B00005T7G1,"Immediately after this years AFC Championship beatdown of the Steelers, I popped in this DVD to reminisce about the improbable run of the 2001 team.

One thing that made me laugh was a comment made by then-Ram Ricky ""I just can't beat the Pats"" Proehl prior to kickoff. He looks directly into the camera and says ""Tonight..a dynasty is born."" Sure, the Rams were a great team that year, but you just don't mess with karma.

I thoroughly enjoyed this video and it is a must have for Pats fans, hell, football fans in general. I think that the excitement that Drew Bledsoe showed right before the TEAM was introduced proved his unselfishness, despite not getting the Super Bowl start.",1106611200,,682,4.675
1660889,5,B00005T7G1,"I'm not a football fan, but I remember watching the super bowl halftime because I knew u2 was performing and I just love this band. But I never expected it to be so emotional with about 3000 names of people that perished in 9/11. I cried, I couldn't help it. It was so powerful especially with u2 playing ""when the streets have no name"" while the huge panel of names was scrolling on the stage. I bought this DVD not because of the super bowl. I may not remember who was playing that game, or who won, but I'll never forget that moment that U2 played in memory of all those that perished in 9/11. I am so glad I got to relive this moment with this DVD.",1087257600,,652,4.1015625
1660890,4,B00005T7G1,"Okay, so I'm not COMPLETELY neutral...there were enough Michigan alums on the Patriots (especially Tom ""Heart Attack"" Brady) so that I was hoping they'd pull out the win.  And in the most exciting Super Bowl ever played, they did.
This is a terrific season highlights collection from a really improbable championship run.  NFL Films has always been the greatest ambassador the game has; as they have consistently managed to present the game in a way that somehow makes it seem more relevant than it truly is; the film techniques, the epic music accompanying the slow-motion sequences, the on-field microphones...really, there is no other sport that can come remotely close to American football for being as ""made for film"" as it is.
The 2001 season for the New England Patriots seemed even more epic than most...from starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe getting hurt early in the year to the interruption of play due to 9-11 (tastefully covered in a bonus feature unto itself) and Patriots guard and New York City native Joe Andruzzi's relief after finding out that his brothers in the FDNY made it out of the World Trade Center before it went down to the regular season meeting with the St. Louis Rams indicating that just MAYBE the Rams could be had to the emergence of Tom Brady as the star and eventual starting quarterback to the ""tucking"" of former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson and the Oakland Raiders in the last-ever game played at Foxboro Stadium to Brady's injury in the AFC Championship in Picksburgh with Drew Bledsoe stepping in to steer the team to New Orleans for the Super Bowl...and then of course the Super Bowl itself.
I honestly can't think of one NFL season within recent memory that has had that much excitement (once you take Michael Vick's highlights out, at any rate)...this was an incredible journey, accessorized with some choice bonus features including U2's halftime set, the 9-11 tribute, and some old skool Patriots highlights from the 1970's that are sure to bring back some memories (as well as the question as to why a team calling itself ""Patriots"" was doing wearing red tops instead of the Colonial blue).  All-in-all, a superb production from NFL Films of a season that was truly a stand-out in all aspects of the word.
I will deduct a star from this rating because the Super Bowl game itself was not shown either in its entirety or in the full-length NFL Films production of that game from start-to-finish; games like that just don't come along every year; a second disc could have been included dedicated entirely to that one game (Glasgow Celtic Football Club did something similar to this regarding their 2003 UEFA Cup run; a 2nd disc was included showing their quarterfinal match at Anfield with Liverpool in its entirety...a nice touch, so we know it can be done).",1069286400,12,2809,4.872384937238493

1660893,5,B00005T7G1,"This is the greatest DVD ever created.  Growing up in Massachusetts, and only eighteen years of age, I found myself waiting for one of my teams to win a championship.  As the biggest Pats fan in the world, I actually have many people that will back me up on that statement, last year's championship run could not have been better.  Sometimes at night I find myself watching clips on the super bowl and find myself in tears.  It was simply the greatest moment in my entire life.  This DVD helps rekindle those great feelings, and I strongly reccomend purchasing it.",1037318400,,564,4.6

1660895,5,B00005T7G1,"Of course, that is the opinion of a New England Patriots fan. The video is a nice recap of the season, though one wishes it could be a bit longer. Some crucial bits of the season are not shown in the video, such as David Patten's leg touching the ball while his head is out of bounds because he was knocked unconscious play in the second Buffalo game. This is the largest selling sports video of all time.  NFL Films released a second video for Patriots fans entitled ""Three games to Glory"" which shows nearly every play from the 3 playoffs games the Patriots won to get to and win the Super Bowl.",1025827200,2,597,4.283185840707965

For those of you who wanted the whole game...NFL Films is coming out with something that will get pretty close.  Head to [the website] and preorder Three Games to Glory.  They say it really will capture almost every play in a condensed format...kind of like the video presentations Major League Baseball is now doing, if you are familiar with those.

Harry Kalas' narration and the radio play-by-play of the legendary Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti made for exciting entertainment. I am reliving the season from the beginning to its thrilling conclusion over and over! I especially love watching The Snow Game in Foxborough against the Raiders. Thay was one of the greatest football games in NFL history. The AFC Championship Game against the Steelers was sweet to watch, and Super Bowl XXXVI against the St. Louis ""Lambs"" is still incredible and exciting viewing. It is no wonder that this DVD (and Video) is the most-purchased sports video ever! Everybody loves an underdog, and the Patriots were the ultimate 'dogs that won the Super Bowl.  If you are a sports fan (not just a Patriots fan), this DVD is a MUST-OWN.",1018828800,2,944,4.9
1660911,5,B00005T7G1,"I had to laugh when I read some of the reviews here.  When has the NFL ever released a video of the entire Super Bowl in any given year??  NEVER!!  Neither the league nor the networks  would ever allow it.  The advertising on the cover is NOT misleading!!  It says ""Super Bowl XXXVI Champions Patriots"", not just ""Super Bowl XXXVI"".  And if you're literate enough to read the description on the back, it says such things as ""It's all here, from training camp through the Super Bowl...""  I have no sympathy for anyone who was misled.
Has anyone here ever purchased a previous NFL team video?  I have two previous ones of the Patriots (on VHS).  I have one for the 1993 team that went 5-11--a team that was in its first year under Bill Parcells and showed promise by winning it's last four games.  That video is about 30 minutes.  I also have one for the exciting 1997 team that won the division and beat Miami in the first round of the playoffs before losing a very tough game in the second round to Pittsburgh.  That video is a paltry 25 minutes (although I of course enjoyed it).  This DVD here--besides the fact that it has glorious Patriots championship footage--is the best thing I have seen yet from NFL films.  The main feature is a bit over an hour long--plus there is the 30 minutes of extra features.
Now I agree that the unstoppable commercials at the beginning are annoying, and of course a few more things about the season could have been included.  But overall, this was VERY well done!  It truly ran like a great ""beating the odds"" sports movie; I still have to pinch myself to realize this is not fiction!  From the classic narration by the legendary Harry Kalas to the use of the Pats' great radio voices to the footage both on the field and off, the season was very well covered.  For sure, I know the outcome; but I still get chills every time I see it.  The dramatic way it was presented here only enhances the beauty of what was the Patriots' 2001-02 season.
I also LOVE the extra features on legends Steve Grogan and Gino Cappelletti as well as the 1976 team.  The NFL Tribute to America feature I actually wish was a bit longer, but it brings goosebumps almost as much as watching the Super Bowl highlights does.  I am a rock music fan who actually isn't that fond of U2, but I enjoyed their halftime performance at the Super Bowl and enjoyed reliving it on this DVD as well.
So in summary, is this worth your money?  ABSOLUTELY!!  If you have a clue about what NFL Films is allowed to present, and certainly if you are a long-suffering New England Patriots fan, then this DVD is DEFINITELY for you.  I cannot recommend it enough.",1018137600,5,2652,4.418556701030928

This DVD did not look like a review of an NFL teams season, but rather a great story written by one of the great writers of our time.  But it is a look back at the road to the Super Bowl Championship.
One of the most interesting parts of this DVD is that they actually filmed Terry Glenn at training camp!! (They must have taken that film on day 1 or 2 of camp)  The camera work is second to none, and the views that you get from the sidelines are breath taking.

1660913,5,B00005T7G1,"The New England Patriots experienced one of the most magical and improbable seasons in NFL history during the 2001 season.  After finishing 5-11 in 2000, most predicated that the Pats would finish last in the AFC East.  They started the season 0-2 and in the course of their second game loss to the Jets, starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe suffered a severe chest injury.  In stepped 2nd year QB Tom Brady who basically had no NFL experience.  The Pats at this point looked to be worse than predicated.  Instead, Brady led them to an 11-3 record the rest of the way and an AFC East title and first round playoff bye.  Their first playoff game against the Oakland Raiders was a classic, played in the snow at the last game ever played at Foxboro Stadium.  With under two minutes left to play and the Pats down three, Brady was sacked and fumbled the ball, which the Raiders recovered.  The magical season appeared to be over, but after reviewing the play, the ref reversed the call. After being saved by the controversial tuck call, Brady led them down the field for a game tying field goal by Adam Viniatteri who then kicked the game winner in OT.  In the AFC Championship game in Pittsburgh, Brady was knocked out of the game with an ankle injury.  Drew Bledsoe, who returned from the injury and selflessly accepted the backup role, comes off the bench and leads the team to a touchdown on his first drive.  Facing the powerful St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl, no one gave the Pats a chance and they were a two-touchdown underdog.  But from the start of the game, the Pats took control and kept the vaunted Rams offense out of the end zone until the fourth quarter.  The Rams valiantly battled back and tied the score with less than two minutes in the game.  Instead of sitting on the ball and settling for overtime, head coach Bill Bellechik, entrusted Brady to drive them down the field, which he did.  Lining up for a game winning field goal, Viniatteri again splits the uprights, winning the super Bowl with no time left on the clock.  NFL Films does a brilliant job of capturing all of the highs and lows of the team's season. The additions of U2's poignant and heartfelt performance and highlights from the first games back after the events of 9/11 caused the postponement of a week's worth of games only add to this first rate DVD.",1016582400,2,2339,4.533333333333333

For football fans, or anyone interested in a come-from-behind, Miracle on Ice, ROCKY-type plot, this DVD outlines (once) again how believing in yourself and adapting to the situation no matter how hopeless it seems ultimately triumphs thanks to lots of smarts and a ton of sweat.
When I read the reviews for this DVD, it sounded like a bad choice to make at the check-out counter, especially since hockey, not football, is my favorite sport.
But this package really delivers. Add the halftime U2 concert commemorating the fallen of 9/11, I was really impressed.",1016496000,3,669,4.929203539823009
1660935,3,B00005T7G1,"While the Patriots season was one of the most memorable in sports history, this DVD is quite forgetable. It really does no justice to the unbelievable run made by these underdogs. Right from the beginning one wonders what the producers of this video were thinking. What does a ""knight in armor"" have to do with the Patriots? Was the cheesy voiceover in the beginning necessary? The Patriots season can speak for itself, it does not need cinematic bells and whistles to make it more interesting. This video continues to miss the mark by failing to elaborate on the Brady/Bledsoe issue. Was this not a major issue of the season? And how many of us felt the hair stick up on our arms, watching the Patriots come out as a team? Where was the coverage of this sidestory? As a diehard Pats fan I will hold on to this video as memory of the season, but this dvd definitely needs revision!",1016496000,,881,4.5125
1660936,4,B00005T7G1,"This collection of highlights of the Patriots Super Bowl season allows fans to relive the greatest season in Pariots history.  Some of the games get very little coverage, but I suppose NFL films didn't focus much on the Patriots early in the season.  The footage of the Oakland playoff game, in the snow, is great, with some good looks at the field goals and the INCOMPLETE PASS.
The video highlights are complimented by audio tapes from the Patriots radio braodcasts that are first rate.  The DVD bonuses of Steve Grogan and Gino Cappaletti are also great for long-time Patriot fans.  Even the U2 footage is excellent.  As a Patriots fan, I enjoy this DVD each time I watch it.",1016409600,,678,4.663865546218488

The special features show two songs done live at the Superbowl by U2 with a tribute to the victims of 9-11, and another short documentary of a Tribute to America, where it shows the players uniting together to remember and honor the lost lives of the 9-11 tragedy as well as uniting as one country.  I would even like to say, you will get the best snapshot on still frames of the referee blunder that kept Oakland from winning the game at Foxboro in the snow. The footage is very picturesque as the snow causes havoc and perserverance from the players.  Interesting enough, they film also has a short feature on the 1976 PAtriots. Another seasoned highlight of the past where the opposite circumstance happened. A bad call from the referee keeps the Patriots from going on in the playoffs during 76, and who do you think got lucky from that bad call?  Thats right --- Oakland! Well balanced features and tributes, makes this DVD a good buy for football fans.",1015804800,22,1117,4.51980198019802

All the emotion, drama, destiny all rolled into one hour of Brady, Smith, Venetari, Law etc. If you were a New England football fan you couldn't help relive the goosebumps and tears of joy all over again. The dvd version offers a little of everything. Great on the field film effects based on the actual footage almost seems fictional. How could it not? Three overtime game winning field goals (one in a snowstorm in the last game ever to be played in Foxborough Stadium), and a superbowl that not only brought home the Lombardi trophy, but maybe an oscar too! The most satisfying of all was the usage of the Patriot anouncers Gil Santos and should be hall of famer Gino Cappeletti. Their original radio broadcasts were used simultaneously with a majority of the seasonal highlights used on this dvd. If you believed the New England Patriots were a team of magical destiny, this DVD will enhance that feeling. It's something you'll watch over and over, again.",1015718400,2,1025,4.7

I was excited to learn that the DVD of this game would come out and was expecting the whole game. Especially after it was confirmed the U2 halftime show was included as a special feature. I was very dissapointed when I found out it had a review of all the Pats games and only a few minutes on the SB. Although the NFL Films productions are good. I don't think it captured the excitement of the game itself. I hope someone has the sense to release the whole game on DVD.",1015545600,2,612,4.151260504201681

And to the dullards complaining about the whole Super Bowl not being included...you need to check your skull for brain matter. The NFL has NEVER EVER put a SB on tape. They never replay regular season or post-season games in anything but highlight form. Sheesh, go away.",1015545600,4,368,4.3478260869565215

(If you're not, especially if you're a Raiders, Steelers, or Rams fan, save your money!) Fast forward through the hokey medieval metaphor at the beginning -- it's a little bit of an embarrassment, imho -- but the video otherwise does a great job of building the drama of the season: from an 0-2 start to SuperBowl Champs!",1015545600,,482,4.540229885057471

It feels like you are watching a movie, and even though we all know the ending, we are all at the edge of our seats waiting to see it.  I received my DVD yesterday and watched the end about 10 times.  The NFL has never put a complete game on video.  Nobody should have expected that.  If you are a Pats fan, you must own this DVD.

The highlights were great and commentary second to none.  Only 2 things I would have liked to have seen included that were not; the crazy ""Out of Bounds"" ball from the Buffalo game and the opening of the Super Bowl where the Pats came out together ""as a team.""  Other than that, every key play and moment in my memory was captured, including the non-QB passes and the BIG call vs. the Raiders.  Buy it, it's worth every penney!",1015372800,,578,4.4245283018867925
1660958,4,B00005T7G1,"There is much to enjoy on this DVD, but a few annoying aspects, as well. First of all, there are two commercials at the very beginning and you can't skip past them. You are trapped. Also, the opening sequence is a bit cheesy, juxtaposing the Pats and some Medieval jive. Once you get to the actual highlights the DVD gets much better. Great work by NFL Films and very good music. I also enjoyed that much of the on-air commentary from the Pats radio crew is included. Pity the DVD only runs about 60 minutes. So much good stuff to fit into a relatively short time. I could have used many, many more highlights. I also wish there had been more behind the scenes stuff and more extras. Putting U2 in there simply wasn't a selling point for me and I have yet to watch that segment. That ten minutes could have been much better spent on additional game footage. I did enjoy the segment on Steve Grogan. Some coverage of the victory parade in Boston would have been welcome, too. But lets face it, if you're a Pats fan you simply must have it. Small annoyances aside, I could watch this DVD a hundred times and not tire of it. A fitting, if somewhat brief and superficial, documentation of a fantastic season. Maybe next year's Pats Super Bowl celebration DVD will get it completely right.",1015372800,3,1284,4.444915254237288
1660959,3,B00005T7G1,"I expected more. For 65 minutes the season is highlighted, in 3 to 5 minute segments for each game. I was very entertained, but so disappointed because the Pats fantastic Super Bowl performance was only shown for 5 minutes!  I really feel that the video has been advertised as having the ""whole superbowl."" Not just a segment. Also absent was the U2 half-time show. Overall, if you want to relive the '01 season, the tape is worth it, but just don't expect as much as I did!",1015372800,,474,4.448275862068965

1660961,5,B00005T7G1,"The 2001-02 New England Patriots were--and continue to be--the Rodney Dangerfields of football: ""No respect at all."" Before their season even began, many so-called ""experts"" picked them to finish LAST in their division. When starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe was injured in the second game of the season and a young understudy named Tom Brady was thrust into the starter role, these same ""experts"" started digging the Patriots' graves. Throughout the regular season, the ""experts"" called every win a fluke, while every loss was the stagecoach turning back into a pumpkin, just as they had predicted. When the Patriots made the playoffs, the ""experts"" said ""They'll never beat Oakland."" Then, they said ""They'll never beat Pittsburgh."" The Pittsburgh franchise went ahead and printed up their Super Bowl tickets and made hotel reservations in New Orleans BEFORE their playoff game against the Patriots. When the Patriots made it to Super Bowl XXXVI, the ""experts"" called them 14-point underdogs. Their chance of winning? None. Nada. Zilch. Well, the Patriots pulled off the biggest upset in Super Bowl history, beating the much-favored St. Louis Rams. So, who do these ""experts"" pick to win the Super Bowl in '03? The Rams!
In the same manner as the Patriots' season, this DVD starts out slowly, before catching fire. The introduction, which intercuts game footage with footage of men dressed as medieval knights, engaged in mock battle, had me rolling my eyes and thinking, ""I sure hope this DVD gets better in a hurry!"" Fortunately, it does. Those who were hoping to get Super Bowl XXXVI in its entirety may still be disappointed, since the program on this video/DVD is basically a ""highlight reel"" of the Patriots' season, culminating in their appearance in the Super Bowl. The producers of this release wisely chose to use radio announcer Gil Santos's call of Adam Vinatieri's Super Bowl-winning field goal. I watched the Super Bowl with the TV volume turned down, while listening to the game on the radio, and Santos's near-hysterical ""...and it is...GOOOOD!!! IT'S GOOOOD!!! IT'S GOOOOD!!!"" call perfectly captured the excitement of the moment. By comparison, the television announcers sound like they just lost a lot of money, betting on the Rams.  Following the season highlights, there is a moving, on-field tribute to the victims of the September 11th terrorist attacks.  The DVD edition adds U2's Super Bowl halftime performance, plus feature segments about Gino Cappelletti, Steve Grogan and the 1976 Patriots team.",1015286400,5,2526,5.219211822660099

I would trade all of the season long highlights for the entire super bowl game on DVD.
Look at the cover, doesn't it appear that this is a copy of the game? ""Super Bowl XXXVI"" ! You would think the (entire) game would be on it.
If you want a summary of the Patriots season, post season highlights and Super Bowl highlights - This is for you.
If you want to see the BEST super bowl game ever played, watch the tape that you or your friend made of the actual game when it aired.

Of course the hardcore New England fan is going to want much more and in a more biased viewpoint, but since this is made for the general fan you're not going to get that.  This DVD will go over the highlights, give you some special features on past Patriot greats and the U2 halftime show.

I found it to be the perfect memento of a truly wonderful season.  I'm shocked that some people thought that the whole game would be on here, while that would be nice, when have you ever seen that before?
