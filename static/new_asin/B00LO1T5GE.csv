6494086,3,B00LO1T5GE,"Brick Mansions okay...I loved the original B-13 and truly it didn't need to be remade. I mainly went to see this because I am a Paul Walker fan. So if you want to put this next to your Fast and Furious movies, it's not a bad choice. I would recommend buying B-13 and B-13: Ultimatum (along with this).",1408060800,4,301,4.206896551724138

6494090,3,B00LO1T5GE,"In 2018, downtown Detroit becomes a walled in city...by a four foot wall. The Mayor wants to move the people out and build a place for rich people. Meanwhile Lino (David Belle) in a subplot is thwarting drug dealers as a vigilante. Detective Collier (Paul Walker) is also fighting against the bad guys downtown, while other cops are on the take.

Lino's ex-gf (Catalina Denis) gets kidnapped by the bad guys who also jack a vehicle with a suitcase neutron bomb now on a countdown. Collier has to go get the bomb that just happened to be strolling around the walled in city in a vehicle, something he is not smart enough to question until someone points it out to him how odd is the state of events.

The plot was all over the place and uneven. It appears Walker's dad was killed and he was looking for the culprit, but not that hard. David Belle had the best fight moves highlighted early on...i.e urban acrobatics. There was also a grindhouse cat fight. It is hard to imagine this botched screenplay was done by the same guy who did quality work like ""Fifth Element"" and ""Transporter.""

And you can't help but notice that in this film Paul Walker crashes his vehicle at 80-90+ mph and survives because he wore a seat belt.

Action with no substance. Appears to be overrated by Paul Walker fans moved by his untimely death.

I didn't even make it to the end of the movie as at the last section it seemed to jump to movie trailers for something else.

6494184,2,B00LO1T5GE,"I wish Amazon would allow half stars.  In that case I would give Brick Mansions two and a half.  It just does not have enough good stuff to rate an average three stars.  The plot is pretty stupid with a section of Detroit simply walled off, guarded by corrupt cops and the citizens left to their own devices.  That is futuristic science fiction plotting not action movie plotting.
  We do get some good stuff.  David Belle plays a criminal with enough of a heart that we can like him, to the extent that his character is developed at all, which is slender.  But he has an amazing ability to move in an urban landscape like a ferret on crack.  He jumps, climbs, leaps, runs and generally scampers across the sides and tops of buildings with ease and great speed.  We live the late actor Paul Walker very much.  He had a strong screen presence.  We want to watch this, the last film that he actually finished before his untimely death.  He does what he can with the material.  Rapper RZA plays the gang lord and does well in that role.
  The script by Luc Besson and Bibi Naceri lacks connectivity and coherence.  And the props are crap.  In a key plot turn a bomb is strapped to a 'Russian' surface to surface rocket that looks like something you might find at Toys R'us.  And at the end of the film murderous, drug dealing killers stop their brutal behavior and instantly become nice boys.  It would be like a wolverine suddenly turning into a unicorn with a rainbow shooting out its behind.  Just dumb and not believable in the least.
  On the up side, the gaggle of production companies took in $69 million on a $28 million budget, so they came away happy.",1468368000,,1658,4.417218543046357

6494187,3,B00LO1T5GE,"Based on the extended edition: I knew this was a foreign financed film. I knew from the Europa Corp's open to lower my expectations a bit because movies like this usually contain scripts written by people who's first language isn't English, but they write it based on watching older action movies (probably Cannon movies from the 80's), but with new style action, and I was correct. The dialogue is terrible and some is downright corny. The majority of actors can't act, especially David Belle (Lino), who is the worst. That said, the action is decent, albeit unrealistic, and it's still pretty entertaining despite it's many shortcomings, including Belle's acting.. Paul Walker obviously did this one for the paycheck, and it's apparent, because he looks drained and rather sluggish through much of the film. It's sad that this was his last fully completed film. Just keep your expectations lowered and you'll be okay.. 2 & 1/2 stars.",1465171200,,935,5.0

6494232,3,B00LO1T5GE,"This movie is based on the French movie, ""District 13,"" a absolutely great action adventure, that takes place in the near future, where poor neighborhoods are just walled up and forgotten. It's a little reminiscent of the, ""Escape From"" movies with Kurt Russell, but with really a really cool style of French Martial Arts, deftly preformed by David Belle, who reprises his role in this American version, starring Paul Walker in one of his final movies. Here Paul plays cop who begins to sympathizes with the citizens of the district, and his convict partner, who has been railroaded by the system. This is a character we've seen from Walker before, but he plays the part so well, we don't mind. However, it's obvious martial arts are not in his wheelhouse. While the story is okay, it doesn't have the edge of the French version, even though both screenplays were written by Luc Besson. If you want to see a good movie, watch District 13, if you want to see Paul Walker in one of his final roles than watch this, either way you'LL be entertained.",1439683200,,1046,4.65945945945946

6494244,4,B00LO1T5GE,"Like many films, this one has had mixed reviews, myself, i have to say, the film is certainly entertaining, which is
what most of us want from a film in truth.
In the not to distant future, 'Detroit' law and order had broken down, it was decided to put all the bad-eggs in one
basket, 'Brick Mansions' the most dangerous villains encased behind a wall, living in one run-down area.
Under-Cover Cop 'Damien Collier'(Paul Walker) works to bring down the drug barons, gaining their trust, then
bringing them down.
'Lino' (David Belle) who lives within the walls of 'Brick Mansions' tries hard to go straight, has just destroyed a case
load of drugs belonging to 'Drug-Lord' 'Tremain' (RZA)
'Tremain' needs to get even,he orders that 'Lino's' girlfriend'Lola'(Catalina Denis) be taken prisoner to draw 'Lino' to
them.
'Damien's' superiors set it up for him to double up with 'Lino' to get him into 'Brick Mansions' and within reach of
'Tremain' - though not an ideal union, the two have to unite to save 'Lola' and indeed bring down the Drug-Baron'
The two will have to get past 'Tremains' army of foot-soldiers first, the two make a formidable team.
This is an action-packed thriller that should content most action-fans.
Many will remember and have been saddened by the fatal crash that took 'Paul Walker's' life in a suburb of Los Angeles,
November 30th 2013 aged 40.

6494273,5,B00LO1T5GE,"While this is a very good action film, it will probably be best remembered for being Paul Walker's last completed role before his death.

Set in Dertoit in 2018, the story concerns the slum area called Brick Mansions and the corruption brought about by Crime Lords taking over the area. Damien Collier is an undercover cop helping to take them down, specifically Alexander who killed his father who was also a cop.  When a neutron device is highjacked and then accidentally activated by Alexander, Collier goes undercover with Lino, a Mansions resident who's also been fighting Alexander and was recently framed and in jail. With his help, he's supposed to defuse the bomb before it demolishes Brick Mansions.  Collier and Lino immediately class because the cop doesn't believe the con will help him and the con doesn't think the cop has the welfare of the residents in mind.

From the first chase scene, which is a very prolonged one and athletic over rooftops, before the credits through three twists of plot, this is a very entertaining film.  There's not much acting, though the bickering between Damien and Lino keeps the action going also and is amusing enough to make it a pseudo-buddy film. It's a bit unusual because of the three turns in the plot and the fast pace makes the movie seem shorter than it's 90 minutes. It's a good film, but for some people, myself included, there was a sadness hanging over it because of the subsequent loss of its star as we are reminded by the end credits which dedicate the film to Walker.",1428192000,,1533,4.726591760299626

6494280,4,B00LO1T5GE,"Brick Mansions probably ranks a little bit higher with people's reviews and you're less critical watching it on the screen as well, since you know it was Paul Walker's last film.  It is an American remake of a successful foreign film (France's Banlieue 13 ""District 13""), in fact the main character who does the cool parkour stunt action scenes is played by the same actor from the original.  The film suffers from the fact that it gives information at the start I guess to pad out the story, that could have been left out that lets down what should be surprises in the storyline later.  Therefore Brick Mansions is a pretty predictable film.  The movie does have action though, and a lot of it, which is why is your buying/renting this sort of film in the first place and although some of it is a little over the top to be plausible, and massive number of pursuers disappear from time to time for one on one fights, taunts and key pieces of dialogue to play out, it's still a lot of fun to watch.  Some characters aren't consistent in their morals or behaviour either, I can't really elaborate any more on that without giving anything away.  The parkour running and fight scenes are pretty cool, Walker even participates to a mild extent in some of them.  Walker's action mostly revolves around fast moving vehicles, ridiculously hanging off the back of, or driving, obviously cashing in on his role in the Fast Furious franchise, but it's hard not to think about how he died when watching scenes of him surviving movie wrecks that obviously you don't walk away from unhurt in real life.

Paul Walker fans obviously won't be disappointed in his performance, David Belle (the actor from both this remake and the original) also is brilliant as Lino, and a lot of people will non doubt check out his other action films after this. Catalina Denis who plays Lino's ex girlfriend also steals a few scenes although she doesn't have as much time on film as Walker and Belle.  I think we'll see her in a lot more films in the future.",1427328000,,2025,4.571823204419889

I would normally think and say Paul Walker was overrated.  However, in this film he was actually not only quite good, but enjoyable to watch.  His film partner, Lino (David Belle) was quite the accomplished athlete.  That man's stunts were incredible.

Movie-wise, the was Escape from L.A..  It was fun, predictable, and entertaining.  Again, much of the entertainment came from Mr. Belle's athleticism.  That man is GOOD and his abilities managed to make (or the film HAD to make) Walker's look good too.

The acrobatic antics of one of the main characters was cartoonish and comical and who wrote the dialog... a 10 year old? Very cliched.  You want a good action move?

6494318,2,B00LO1T5GE,"/// (Regular review for those unfamiliar with the original movies)
Brick mansions is a remake of the French movies district 13 and district 13 ultimatum. For a simple action movie this is enjoyable though it's just average. The story doesn't make too much sense but there's enough action for you to enjoy the ride. If you give this movie a chance and enjoy it (even a little) I would strongly recommend that you watch the original French movies that are dubbed. All in all I would say this is a good movie to rent.

/// (For fans of the original movies)
 This movie is not a very good remake of the district 13 movies in anyway. As someone who watched the originals I couldn't help but notice the similarities and differences.
  -- Action --
The parkour action in the original is phenomenal, this version seems tame in comparison. Everything seems simpler and shorter. Part of the problem with the action is that they cut to different camera angles. This makes the action seem fake. The parkour action is really being done by David Belle and are not camera tricks. The fact that these actions are really being done is what makes them exciting to watch.  Sadly how it's shot and edited they seem fake. There is also less action. At the end they make their way up to the mayor and they take the elevator instead of the stairs. In the original taking the stairs led to some really good action sequences. In the beginning, the shoot out is much simpler with less fighting and no real parkour. They instead add a car scene. The parkour is why the D13 movies were so amazing and in this movie it's hardly there.
-- The Story --
The plot is very similar to the originals. They took a little of each to make this one. The Story is where I would expect the Hollywood version to be better. Instead it's falls short. Things just aren't set up that well, they just seem to happen. There's a scene in the beginning where a guy wants to write his phone number on another guys hand. Originally there was dialogue that set this up to be at least somewhat believable. In this version he just grabs the guy's hand. The guy who's pointing a gun at him. It doesn't make sense why he wasn't shot. A lot of the scenes are like this, where the action is the same but the setup is missing.

 I could go on and on about the shortcomings of this remake.
All in all it's not a bad movie, it's actually okay. It just doesn't compare to the district 13 movies. A remake of a 5 and 10 year old movie that makes no improvements; yet alone falls short just doesn't make sense. This very much feels like a cheap copy.  Worth a watch, but I wouldn't buy it since I already own the better movies it's based on.",1421366400,,2675,4.346693386773547
6494319,3,B00LO1T5GE,"It was lacking in many places, but it did not leave me down when it came to fast fast action. If you like just fast paced violence with a flaccid storyline this will do. Wasn't awful, but I don't think I have much incentive to watch it again.",1421366400,,242,4.0625

Also when paul drives the van through the building and the steering & brakes go out. The camera switches to the steering wheel this time its a newer mustang steering wheel and a stick shift. then it shows the same speedo from the mustang chase with the waitress chick.

There was time, however, for some personal interaction, reflection, and humor which made it really enjoyable. The other character whose name escapes me was incredible at par corps...or however it's spelled. He was astonishing! They had the sense to let Paul Walker hesitate at some stunts, and find a different path. He almost looked clumsy compared to that other guy...but not quite.

It take one year to film a Fast Furious movie, and the writer and directors changed some of the original movie, so all of the little Paul filmed will not be viewed by audience. I feel as his fan; love Brick Mansions and accept that this movie is a great film and Paul Walker's last movie. Yes I will watch Brick Mansions over and over again.",1415318400,,479,4.274725274725275
6494490,4,B00LO1T5GE,"Boy, do I miss Paul Walker. anyway, this movie looks to be a remake of some kind of a movie called (I believe) B13. I did like B13 a lot and so to, do I like this movie. Some plot is involved, not much to get in the way of all the action but some plot. I love the parkour, gymnastics and fight scenes in this, all very imaginative and fast. David Belle is the parkour guy and Paul as a cop keeps up very well. Very entertaining action movie. Sit back and enjoy.",1415318400,,461,3.9148936170212765
6494491,1,B00LO1T5GE,"BRICK MANSIONS had the potential to be a decent film with some good action sequences and a social message, but it fails to deliver on both of those fronts. The lone bright spot in this film is a few scenes where David Belle gets to show off his parkour, but it was used far too little in my opinion. The plot is threadbare and knee-deep in action movie cliches. Paul Walker's character is out to avenge his father's death, David Belle's character just wants to clean up his neighborhood, and they are both trying to stop a nuclear bomb from destroying Detroit.

 As this is a remake, I think it's entirely fair to compare it to the original. In this case, that film was DISTRICT B13 (or, BANLIEUE 13). I've only seen some clips from it, but I know that the basic plot is the same. However, why that one seemed to have worked is because it was relevant to French culture, in which the areas outside Paris proper, the ""banlieues,"" are neglected and often havens for crime and violence. Translating this into something American audiences would understand isn't too difficult, and they made a good choice to set this in future Detroit, but they fail to do anything but pay lip service to the idea that there are areas in the US that have become ghetto-ized and neglected by the government that's supposed to protect and serve them. The way it was dealt with in the movie was extremely trite and cliched.

 However, the other aspects of the film weren't that great either. The acting is poor across the board, and Paul Walker came across the best. When Paul Walker is the best actor in your movie, then you have a problem. Making matters worse was David Belle who, if that was his real voice, sounded completely unnatural in English. If it wasn't, then that was some very bad dubbing. To top it off, RZA is abysmal as the main villain, Tremaine. He may be a good rapper, but a good actor he is not. And then the material the cast was given to work with wasn't really great either. Everyone gets saddled with awful dialogue, and the delivery didn't help matters much either.

 But how does the action hold up? Thankfully, it was comprehensible for the most part. Some fight sequences were a bit too choppily edited, but not to the point where I couldn't make out what was going on. And even though there wasn't enough parkour, it was still adequately filmed. What I didn't really like about the action was the occasional speed ramping/slow motion. If they had just let the action flow naturally, the film as a whole wouldn't have dragged so much.

 Overall, I went in with low expectations and those weren't even met. The story was cliched and silly, and the acting was very poor, even by this kind of movie's standards. The action was decent, but there wasn't enough parkour to my liking. Thankfully this won't be Paul Walker's last movie, as Fast & Furious 7 has yet to come out. For those curious about this movie, just watch DISTRICT B13. This movie is a piece of garbage.",1415232000,3,2970,4.527985074626866

Rza is unconvincing as a ghetto villain which is odd because is actually a ghetto villain - or maybe he justed played one in the Wu Tang Clan.  It was wholly uninspiring and a rental only movie.  The plot is predictable.  The bad guys turn out to be good guys and the good guys are the bad guys.  The action was good.  The action movie is largely played-out as a cinematic premise.

6494640,3,B00LO1T5GE,"Oh, man, this is hard to rate.  Why?  Because there truly are some great action sequences in this movie.  And Paul Walker (R.I.P.) was such a hard-working action star.  But, damn, how do you get this much talent into a movie and make it dull!?!  The mediocre cliche plot, the corny dialogue, and the BLATANTLY stupid consequences of action.

Ok, to not spoil anything, I will generalize as much as possible.  The stupid parts:

1) If someone gets hit in the face, HARD, there will be blood.  Some people get cuts, some people get nothing.  Weird.

2) If you toss an unconscious man out of a vehicle doing more than 60, his head will explode against the blacktop.

3) If you fire dozens of bullets of at least three different calibers through a car door, they WILL hit the driver and passenger.

4) If you jump off of a building and slam your chest into a brick wall, you will have rib problems, breathing problems, maybe even pee your pants a little.

5) Big time drug dealers do not CARE like Mr. Rogers for their neighborhoods.

6) If you can handle a car at over 80 mph, around crazy turns in the projects, you do not simply turn into a pile of tires when a sniper fires ONE BULLET at you.  Especially when people have been firing bullets at you all along.

7) If you have a giant, please use the giant.  His fight scene turned out so underwhelming.  And that's sad, because this actor has a great career possible as various strong men, villains, gentle giant characters, even super heroes.  Show him off and let's see what happens when his fist meets a pretty boy's face.

Brick Mansions is entertaining until they start talking.  It gets worse when they crack a joke or witty line.  But the action can be intense and beautifully violent!  This movie does a lot of action perfectly.  Imagine Rumble in the Bronx (Jackie Chan) taken seriously, with death as a real possibility: that's Brick Mansions.  The stunt actors sell the violence REALLY well.  The hand to hand stuff and escape sequences are excellent.

Even the ending is a nice bit of poetic justice.  But the film just did not build realistically enough to that point.  Bad guys become good guys too quickly.  And suddenly people are enjoying life in the ghetto overnight.  What?  Huh?  Brick Mansions' ridiculous parts outweigh its great parts.

It's WORTH WATCHING, but don't buy it.",1413158400,,2348,4.575903614457832

The original K2, and the original villain Taha, were much more charismatic and interesting nemeses.  And Belle's chemistry with Cyril Rafaelli worked so much better than his pairing with Paul Walker (of whom I am a fan, and who does a credible job here, but the chemistry just isn't there).  There's too much wooden acting, and too many poor (not just compared to the original) editing and sound choices, for this to be a top quality action flick.  That said, it's not unwatchable, so if you're not a die-hard fan of the original (as I am), but you love action films, you will likely still find it somewhat amusing.",1413072000,,753,4.58955223880597

6494699,4,B00LO1T5GE,"Forget the dialogue, plot and characters; this movie is about parkour - the activity of running up walls, jumping across rooftops, swinging the body over empty spaces, etc.

the movie opens with a fearless vigilante, Lino, trying to upset the drug empire of Big Dog in the Detroit of the Not So Distant Future. In that future, because of out of control crime rates in the slums, civil government has withdrawn from ghettos like ""Brick Mansions,"" and have left them to stew in their own juices behind high walls and military check points. Paul Walker's Collier is a Detroit detective who wants justice in a very corrupt systems.  He is sent into Brick Mansions because - shades of ""Escape from New York"" - a neutron bomb has been hijacked by Big Dog.  So, Collier and Lino hook up to take on Big Dog, who has kidnapped Lino's ex-girlfriend.  The two engage in improbable stunts, fight each and eventually work up a respect for each other.

The stunts are where the heart of this movie is.  Most of the stunts are wildly improbable, and you just have to go with the flow. If you can't, or if your ""willing suspension of disbelief"" meter trips in the absence of nuanced characters or sharp dialogue, or in the presence of not very good sound qualities, then skip this movie.

On the other hand if you liked ""The Fast and Furious"" or you like a movie that is basically an extended parkour stunt sequence, which were actually jaw dropping most of the time, then this is your movie.

6494935,2,B00LO1T5GE,"This movie was a remake of District 13 with the same actor who is helping Paul Walker' s character. The original had him stealing a drug shipment to get himself and his sister out of the walled in district by kidnapping the guy running g the district when they were brought to him.  Long story short the cops guarding the gate take a bribe and the bad guy leaves with the sister and he goes to jail for all the damage he did crashing into the station. The movie jumps forward bad guy buys a middle on the black market and will launch it I to the city and then enters the guy who played Paul Walkers character and the guy is released from charges to help the cop get to the middle and stop the launch. Extra incentive the sister is chained up directly behind the middle, so if they fail to stop it the sister is fried and the two guys with to get through an army guarding it. Same primess for the cop about the father and dirty politicians planning to use this to take down the district. The original and the sequel were both on Kindle PRIME for free the original was dubbed from French to English and the sequel had subtitles and was in French. Both were good, it's a shame they just didn't do a straight remake, Hollywood always remakes all of these movies that do great over seas, but then they always try to change them.

Plus, the typical evil right wingers wanting to kill off the low income people has been beaten to death and getting quite obnoxious. And having the people revolt and suddenly have a life style change to legal activity was a bit much....

6494954,3,B00LO1T5GE,"""Revenge and justice are not the same thing."" Damien Collier (Walker) is an undercover cop who wants to take down Tremaine (RZA), a crime lord who killed his father. Ex-convict Lino (Belle) has taken it upon himself to stop the drug trafficking that Tremaine has been running in and out of Detroit's projects known as Brick Mansions. When Lino's girlfriend is kidnapped it becomes personal for Lino and now Damien and Lino must work together to stop Tremaine and save the city. Soon after Paul Walker did a movie called The Hours came out which I thought was a great movie and the one he should be remembered for. It was something totally different than anything he had done. This is a return to the cookie cutter role he was known for. The best way to describe this is a Fast and Furious with running instead of driving. Paul Walker again plays an undercover cop that infiltrates the ""bad guys"" to stop something illegal but ends up having more in common with them and siding with them over the police force. If you like the Fast and Furious type movies you will really like this one. As for me this was a little repetitive and felt much longer then the 90 min run time. Overall, fans of Paul Walker and his movies will really enjoy this I had a hard time getting into it and felt like it dragged a lot. I give this a B-.",1410048000,5,1322,4.378048780487805
6494955,3,B00LO1T5GE,"Brick Mansions is a Hollywood remake of a 2004 French action movie District B13 (Banlieue 13). If you have seen the original, you have already seen the film virtually. And most probably you will find the original better.

The difference between the two versions is that the new, English-speaking one, which is set in the 2018 Detroit, features Paul Walker in his last completed role, as an undercover cop Damien Collier trying to find a stolen weapon of mass destruction. In the citys crime-infested area called Brick Mansions, he forms an unlikely duo with a resident Lino (David Belle, reprising the role he played in the original), whose ex-girlfriend Lola (Catalina Denis) is kidnapped by the local crime lord Tremaine Alexander (RZA).

The screenplay is typical of Luc Besson  stock characters and fast-paced story with a few twists on the way. It is not that great, not that terrible, just good enough for a mindless action movie. What really matters is action, especially parkour-inspired action that made District B13 something original. And thats where Brick Mansions disappoints.

Thanks to David Belle and the films stunt team, the action scenes are decent, if not as great as that of the original. One big problem is the rather choppy editing that almost kills the tension of the action sequence, especially car and gun action.

Sadly this will be the last starring role for Paul Walker. I really miss him.",1409961600,28,1418,4.966244725738397

6494966,2,B00LO1T5GE,"I've always watch Paul Walker movies. His swagger has always been light and entertaining.

This 90 minute advertisement for Parkour, called Brick Mansions, makes excessive and at times embarrassing use of David Belle (founder of Parkour, apparently) in its action scenes. Turning the sport into a martial art looks silly at times.

An insatiably predictable plot combined with ludicrous action scenes (e.g. machine guns unable to pierce sheet metal on cars), idiotic henchmen (the ones in this movie seem barely smart enough to walk upright), made this movie more or less a waste of time.

The movie is 90 minutes long. At the 70 minute mark a guy gets hit on the head with a cinder block and--trust me, I'm not making this up--there are even bird chirping sounds overlaid over the top as if it were a cartoon. At that point I decided I am better than this and stopped watching. But then I went to rottentomatoes and one of the reviews there compelled me to finish, to see if the very ending was as bad as the reviewer had hinted. It was.",1409616000,,1038,4.630434782608695

6494973,4,B00LO1T5GE,"Brick Mansions is an action movie on caffeine. It's a movie that will make you say ""what?"" and ""whoa!"" in equal measures. Slick as David Belle jumping a building, cool as the other side of the pillow, and subtle as an exploding grenade, Brick Mansions is the funnest action film I've seen since Edge of Tomorrow. This is the Luc Besson we've all been missing; this is the Paul Walker we all loved; and this is the kind of action that makes movies special.

Brick Mansions doesn't want to be the next Bourne or Lethal Weapon; and it doesn't want to engage your brain on the next level. Brick Mansions wants to take you on the wildest, craziest ride it can for 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 9 seconds (if you stay for the credits...which you probably won't). Along for the ride is Paul Walker, playing the straight good guy with a bit of an edge that he did so well (*whimpers slightly* rest in peace, man). David Belle is present, as are his 12 abs and 26 tattoos (I didn't count. Don't quote me.), not to mention his parkour skills that make Spider-Man look ponderous and slow. RZA chews so much of the scenery I'm surprised we don't see the bite marks where he sank his pristine teeth in.

Though more than RZA's teeth, all over the film we see the fingerprints of Luc Besson. The man who, like a benevolent god, gave us Leon: The Professional, Taxi, and Nikita, and cursed us with something like five Arthur and the Invisibles movies...is back on top form with his singular and very often fabulously overblown style. The action here is some of the most inventive, fast-paced, slickest and coolest that we've seen in a while. Take David Belle for example. He doesn't brawl; he bounces through the air on coiled springlike-muscles like some nimble jungle cat. Paul Walker, on the other hand, is always ready with a quip and a solid American punch. Together, their set-pieces sizzle like fire. Fists, guns, cars, sticks, chains, and yes, bricks all merge together in a truly awesome cornucopia of riveting action, sure to make an action junkie wet their pants.

Others may be slightly less enthusiastic. Other than it's cool but borrowed premise, and the aforesaid sizzle in the camera and action, Brick Mansions is kind of derivative. We see the Good cop looking for revenge, super-fighter ex con, hot ex-girlfriend, bad black dude who's more stylish than the rest, and the other cliches and tropes that come pre-packaged with most action movies. The ending is kind of sappy, and the plot hangs loose like a baggy T-shirt.

But underneath that baggy T-shirt is an action movie with abs. An action movie that plays fast and loose with reality; one that's riveting and fun; one that knows how not to take itself seriously; and one that's explosive and crazy; and perhaps, one that will make you miss the talents of one of our most dependable action heroes: Paul Walker. My final rating? Four bricks out of five (perhaps a Brick Highrise)...

P.S. I hope you enjoyed this review, and that it was helpful in your decision. If it was, please give it a like. Please let me know your thoughts on the film in the comments.",1408579200,36,3108,4.613019891500904

The action is a little better in this one, I think, and the original is just great all around. This is basically a shot for shot remake of the original while changing some things and making the action a lot cooler. I don't remember David Belle doing a lot of parkour in the original aside from the first scene. I watched this with hopes that they would add more parkour. I was not disappointed there. The weakest part of this movie comes from David Belle being French. I don't know if he know's English or not, or how well he does, but they decided to dub his lines. The dubbing is annoying, especially in the beginning scenes. Overall it is worth a watch, but don't choose one or the other. Either watch both, the original and this or just watch the Original.",1507334400,,892,4.347305389221557
