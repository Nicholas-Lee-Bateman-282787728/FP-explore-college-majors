8474034,5,B000MCH1IK,"The achievements of great political personalities in history and their contributions is typically known to all. But not much is often known about how these men and women got to the center stage. This movie attempts to capture the formative years of Gandhi during which time he slowly evolved from being an ordinary lawyer to becoming the revered national leader we all know about.

Rajit Kapur and Pallavi Joshi make a good couple in this movie - the acting is good, but the use of English as the main language in this movie makes it seem rather unnatural and forced.

I loved the soundtrack: Usha Uthup's rendition of Vande Matharam is a classic... truly inspiring. This is a must-watch movie for anyone interested in Gandhi, his principles and philosophy.",1232755200,,757,4.8604651162790695
