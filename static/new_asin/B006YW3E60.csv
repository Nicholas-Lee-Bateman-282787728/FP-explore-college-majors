8748549,5,B006YW3E60,"Paul Colman (Jason Lee) is reluctantly having a bachelor party. He innocently buys a bear for an inept hula girl (Julia Stiles) that was part of the entertainment. He wakes up to find her in his bead and is fianc&eacute; on the way. From there it is one situation after another and snowballs. Will he ever straiten it out with his fianc&eacute;? And what is to become of the hula girl?

Yes the first thing you will notice is that this is formula. The whole reason we pick a genera is because we like to see variations on a formula; who can do it better and what different twist can be placed in the story and keep it on track. If this had been played with some actor that had to rely on past films reputations like Adam Sandler the film would not work.

My favorite scene was the one where Paul (with a strait face) tells Karen that the panties (obviously used) she is holding came from a bin at a discount store. She dials up the store for verification.
One added plus to the movie is Larry Miller as Minister Ferris who knew or suspected everything and could not tell. See him again when he can really branch out in ""Radioland Murders"" (1994) and ""Undercover Blues"" (1993).",1496534400,,1176,4.365296803652968
