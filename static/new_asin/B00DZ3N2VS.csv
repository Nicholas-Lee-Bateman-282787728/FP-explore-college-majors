Many times I have observed Sifu Scott Jensen perform this set and it is exactly the same as his teacher taught him.

8599390,5,B00DZ3N2VS,"I have purchased Kung Fu form training DVD's online before and while they did show you the form, they didn't slowly show you each movement. This DVD is great, it is broken down into sections and each move is taught so it is easy to learn the form.  I will be buying more DVD's from Shifu Scott in the future.  Thanks Shifu!!",1448582400,,324,4.209677419354839
