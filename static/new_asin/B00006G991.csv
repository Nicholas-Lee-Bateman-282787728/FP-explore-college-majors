8285309,5,B00006G991,"This is a lovely video about the United Kingdom from *Families of the World,* and like the other films in this series, it's all about two kids, their families, and their daily lives. Jessica lives on a dairy farm in the west of England with her extended family on their ancestral lands, plus some they rent from Prince Charles. She is a cute kid who is almost overshadowed in her video profile by the adorable animals whom her family raises (primarily very young calves, at their most engaging). James is 10 and lives in Bath, an ancient seaside resort that is part of a modern city. The kids in our family were intrigued by James's narration about the freedoms that British subjects enjoy, which the kids recognized from our own Constitution. They were taken by the beautiful place where he lives and by the mix of the very old and the very new in his life and Jessica's.

Our kids noticed the differences in what people call everyday items (biscuits for cookies, orange squash for an orange juice drink, football for soccer) and were intrigued by the lives of two children who live surrounded by architecture and culture that seem much more storied than our own. This was a good issue to discuss after we all watched the video: What does it mean when we say a country has a culture? What does it mean if a country has a state church, but also has religious freedom? How do the freedoms of these English kids differ from our own, and how are they the same? The Teacher's Guide included with this video has other useful information about activities, history, and a complete transcript of the video narration, which is done by two kids and is in English. (My friends who are ESL teachers love these videos, because the narration is straightforward, interesting, and easy to follow.)

If you go on YouTube, two trailers are available from this video, one for Jessica's section of the film and one for James's: ""Families of the United Kingdom (Families of the World),"" Rural Trailer and Urban Trailer. Well worth watching, as is the full-length video. This is one of my favorites in this great series.",1290470400,3,2098,4.652291105121294
