8122167,5,B000FGFD6U,"For years I have done standard push-ups and have not seen results.  After doing this program for a short amount of time; I feel the muscles in my backs and triceps building. This circular training really works and I don't know why it has taken me so long to discover it but now that I have; this is the workout I will be doing and a lot of other stuff I have been doing will be going away.  I can only say 'Try it and you will like it'.  I have to chuckle when people say how expensive the DVDs are because I have spent so much on programs that don't work, that's expensive.  As a professional yoga teacher I hear that all the time but what people don't realize is all the training we have paid for and all the work we have put in to present programs to the public.  We aren't born knowing this stuff; we have spent our lives learning, training and spending a lot to do it.  Mr. Sonnon is an excellent trainer and has the ability to be a 'teachers teacher'.  Not all people have that gift.  I have known many teachers who are great at what they do but don't have the ability to teach it to others; so all I can say is 'Thanks, Mr. Sonnon', for sharing with us.  I am not a Scott Sonnon groupie but know he is good at what he does and it does work.  It is not an easy program but will give you results.  What more could we ask for?",1254268800,4,1330,3.981132075471698
8122168,5,B000FGFD6U,"This is a great program. It is 1 of 3 programs designed to expand on the 3 primary body weight exercises (the other being squats- Flowfit, core work- Be Breathed). It is also a great stand alone. If you want serious upper body strength throughout the range of motion of the joints this is the program for you. It has three levels making it accessible- trust me level 1 is tough- and it gives you challenges to work toward. When combined with the other two you have a tremendous conditioning program.",1217548800,,499,4.4945054945054945
8122169,3,B000FGFD6U,"Scott Sonnon's innovative approach to exercise seems to be one of many ""new"" ways to train and for exercise junkies like myself, just the idea of adding power or ""yang"" into yoga (though I think it has been there for six thousand years and it is still practiced by many who believe that it needs to be balanced and who have not yet become ""wimpy, milquetoast gurus"" as Mr. Sonnon asserts) was enough to make me plunk down my $40 to see what it is all about.  As a lifetime athlete with martial arts, yoga, track, triathlon, tennis, and skiing competition in my background, (no world titles, however) it's always been imperative to keep the whole body and mind intact.  I haven't always succeeded and Sonnon's FP will enhance my yoga practice toward that end.  But my point is this: what is so precious about the products that would cost up to three to four times times as much as another yoga tape? After viewing the DVD, which is produced very inexpensively, with marginal audio (echo), one camera angle, and about six seconds of music that pounds like a car alarm that won't disengage, I still don't know.  Mr. Sonnon has created the mystique of something precious, without delivering the goods worth the price.",1177977600,14,1213,4.654205607476635
8122170,4,B000FGFD6U,"Sonnon has a lot of ""true believers"" who think he can do no wrong, but I'm not one of them. He can overreach himself sometimes in his attempt to be all things to all people. But the man is a genius of movement, and I feel that his emphasis on health and vitality first, strength and conditioning 2nd, (with cosmetics and 'ripped abs' somewhere in 6 or 7th place) makes him a valuable resource for anyone who wants to improve their health in a sustainable, integrated manner.

""Forward Pressure"" is an example of Sonnon at his most useful and accessible. While most so-called ""fitness gurus"" specializing in bodyweight exercise recommend simply performing hundreds of reps of various pushups, Sonnon truly ""sophisticates"" bodyweight upper body exercise with a scalable, integrated set of floor movements that both challenge the body AND respect its natural frame of reference. Let's face it, most people can't do 100's of pushups every day without suffering eventual shoulder/rotator cuff injury, no matter how many different kinds they do (Hindus, Divebombers, one armed, Tigers, etc), and its boring as hell after a while. With his usual flair for ""sophisticating"" movment, Sonnon gets around this by altering the ""frame"" of the exercises in such a way that this problem is avoided almost entirely. He shows a scalable, progressive flow form that mimics much of the Hatha yoga ""Sun Salute"", but with an upper body emphasis, and in three dimensions and six directions. More importantly, he also teaches ""corrections"" to the form, corrective exercises that will offset any potential imbalances caused by working FP. This is in sharp contrast to most so-called ""fitness routines"", which can often lead to unexpected imbalances in the soft tissues of the would-be fitness enthusiast. These corrective exercises may be the best part of the DVD, such are their wide application to undoing the harm that years of unbalanced, slump-shouldered living can cause.

I am still working on the 'easy' level of the three variations, and it is a killer. 15 minutes of FP is enough to smoke me at this point, and I've trained for years at various aspects of strength and conditioning. The sustained output required for the upper body and torso is balanced by just enough rest to allow the student to work far harder and more intensely than a typical 'pushup regime' would. I can only imagine what sustained, disciplined pursuit of the FP program will do for my strength and health after a year or so.

Why not the full five stars? Well, for one thing, the DVD is rather pricey and the instructional program itself is rather brief. A lot of people will argue that ""you get what you pay for"", and that $40 isn't too much for something that is truly intelligent and well done. Well, I don't want my money back, or anything, but I was hoping for a little bit more in the way of 'extras'- for instance, an insert in the DVD on program design, appropriate volumes for progressing to each new level, and maybe a few other RMAX previews. A couple extra repetitions of each of the ""flows"" would have helped add to the instructional (and motivational)value of the program, as would a recap at the end of each flow segment.

In the same vein, production values are good - dramatic colors, a nice cylcorama in the background, sexy soft focus lighting. Sonnon himself looks like a million bucks, possibly the best argument possible for the material. But  alternating camera angles from the front and the back and top would have been appreciated, not just the one right-side angle from which the camera doesn't move. A voiceover through some of the more tricky transitions during the flow segments would have been a nice touch. And the endless looping of the 30 second 'drum and bouzouki riff' became quite annoying after 5 minutes. A little of this kind of of looping goes a LOOOOONG way on an exercise video, folks.

Still, this is an excellent fitness resource, and if you've got the cash to pay the initiation fee to your local health club, I would recommend that you spend it on this DVD instead. It will do you a whole lot more good than walking on some silly treadmill and doing bicep curls in the squat rack!",1163289600,21,4186,4.7908587257617725
8122171,4,B000FGFD6U,"I received this about a week ago and am hopelessly addicted. I've even started getting up early just to do the damn thing and I hate getting up early!

Ok,what is this? It's Sonnon's yoga for blokes basically. It comes in three levels and has teaching guides to all the exercises, three flows and then in an especially nice touch, compensatory exercises to go with it. The instructions are clear and Sonnon has an authoritive style. Although, none of the exercises are super demanding, when they are put into the flows it becomes a whole new ball game. Even beginner is taxing me at the moment but I'm improving fast.

The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that there are a few minor production quality issues which stop it getting the perfect five. The exercises could have benefitted from a recap at the end of each one. The flows themselves are a little confusing at first as to what exercises are being done. An accompanying voice over or ticker or even an intro sheet would have been a real boon to the first time user.

Minor quibbles aside, this is great. Although, I prefered the twinkling eyed humour and charisma Sonnon displayed on warrior wellness, the new grimmer, shaven headed, muscular version has produced an outstanding instructional tape that I heartily recommend to anyone who needs a healthy way of getting stronger.",1148342400,14,1348,4.727659574468085
