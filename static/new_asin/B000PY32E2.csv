Anyways, this product was labeled DVD-5 on the box but it played normally in my Region 1 DVD player with English subtitles.

I received this film with reserve even though I am a fan of Hong's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Woman-on-The-Beach/dp/B001DDBDCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Woman on The Beach</a>. Fortunately, this 2002 film is also a gem. There is a lot to rave about but I'll end this vague review with the parting words, by all means see this.

There are a handful more that have no U.S. release. So uh, let's create a demand.",1283990400,5,1245,8.132352941176471
8193761,3,B000PY32E2,"It's hard to believe that this film has just recently found a major domestic release, considering that it is actually one of director Hong Sang Soo's most accessible and more well-known films. Fans of his movies will be delighted to know that the subject matter here doesn't stray too far away from what he normally tries to present. For those just tuning into his style, it may be either be an interesting new experience or simply a complete turn off. Whichever type of audience you will fall into, there's still no doubt it will be one you'll most likely remember.

The premise of Turning Gate (whose complete title is actually On The Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate) is relatively quite simple. It centers around a man who tries getting involved with two different women but the relationships produce no real results. The situations he gets himself into make this much more than just the typical one-dimensional failed love flick. Most of the time, how the characters handle each bit of dialogue is completely unpredictable and contrary to what we may expect to happen. It may have been done before, but hardly anyone can make it as interesting or as touching as Hong does. It's definitely not your usual comedy, romance, or drama.

I actually liked it so why three stars? The reason being is because Turning Gate will most likely cause a mixed reaction between viewers. Believe me when I say you will end up either loving it or hating it. Some may find the scenarios engaging and unique, while others will be bored to tears. Even in his native Korea, there are a series of mixed reactions toward his movies. That being said, I simply cannot recommend it alone on the fact that I personally enjoyed it. The only recommendation I could make, however, is that if you're just plain curious about the film (whether or not you are familiar with the director's works) then check it out and make up your own mind. Who knows. You may find it to be a diamond in the rough of a movie that is to your tastes.",1191024000,5,2009,4.624649859943977
