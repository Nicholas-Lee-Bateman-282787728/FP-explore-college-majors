1286136,5,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"" is one of the best films I've ever seen! Simple, yet deliciously subtle, it takes you on a voyage of discovery. Each character is dealing with issues, many of which I could relate to. There is humor and passion, but the overlying sensuality is seductive. This sensuality is not based on sexuality, but the use of all our senses to experience life. The images of chocolate being made and eaten symbolize the forbidden desires of the characters. To those of you afraid this is a ""chick flick"" - don't sell it short. The appeal of the movie isn't limited to women and both times I've seen it (so far), the men in the audience have reacted equally, if not more, than the women to the story and the images. Give ""Chocolat"" a chance to seduce you!",982540800,2,752,4.4963503649635035
1286137,5,B00003CXR1,"A film to awaken the senses and stimulate the sweet tooth, ""Chocolat,"" directed by Lasse Hallstrom and starring Juliette Binoche. is both a sensuous and sensational delight.  In the mid `50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test.  As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch.  What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit.  Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people.  Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the ""sweetest"" film of the year, as well as one of the best, ""Chocolat"" is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.",980985600,13,3507,4.9879931389365355
1286138,4,B00003CXR1,"If I were to rank this film purely based on  the pleasure it supplies, I would give it 5 stars. This film, beautifully concocted from a book of the same name, presents the viewer with  a magical look at a French village in 1959, that is transformed by the arrival  of a lovely French woman and her 6 year old daughter. This village is governed by a wealthy mayor who views all pleasure as sinful and requiring immediate intolerance. He enters into a head on collision with the young woman who views religion as an albatross against the enjoyment of living. The townspeople have been living under the iron will of the mayor and his ancestors for forever and come alive with the arrival of the Chocolatier created by the vivacious newcomers. Juliette Binoche is wonderful, Judi Dench is  perfect, Lena Olin is heartbreaking, Alfred Molina is evil disguised as ""good,"" and Johnny Depp, as always,  is sexy and charming.",980553600,7,916,4.7
1286139,4,B00003CXR1,"Though after watching the film, you may get a hankering that not even Mssrs Hershey and Nestle can help.  Set in a picture-perfect French provincial town in 1959, ""Chocalat"" poses ossified eurocentric traditions against even older, though more liberating pagan traditions enshrined in the recipe book for chocalate.  The nominal leader of the town, the Count de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is also the nominal villain and the personification of those euro values.  Making sure the town attends church every Sunday en masse, the Count writes the sermons for the town's seemingly teengae Priest and chooses which pleasing form is to be the designated evil of the week.  Trying to balance things out, the narrator assures us that the count rules by example, working intolerable hours, writing editorials in local papers, abstaining during lent and nursing in pious silence the ache of his missing Countess.  Worse than pious, however, the Count also represents all that is unimaginative, and when he reminds us that he is superior to the Count of Monte Cristo because he is not a work of fiction, the die is set.  His subtle and craven innuendos against the owner of the new Chocalatiere, the mysteriously exotic Vien (Juliette Binoche) are redundant when his stalwart traditionalism so effectively marks him as the evil vanilla in a sea of liberating chocalate.
The lushly pagan Vien, a descendant of Mayans, knows how to fashion a cure for anything out of chocalate.  As in ""Cider House Rules"" the reasons for her underlying indifference to the established religion isn't as important to the fact of her indifference.  (Remember those stuffy traditionalist trustees for Dr. Larch's orphanage - how we're supposed to distrust them the moment they appear).  Setting up shop, she opens a fantastic Chocalatiere with a display window so lush in chocalate, that it threatens to morph the town from a french provincial town to the sort of mock-up of one that you'd see in Disney's EPCOT.  Handing out free samples of just about anything, and boasting of the power to find, for each customer, their personal favorite choclate. The Joke is that the townspeople, so long cloistered and fettered, have never had any of the life affirming sweets, let alone cultivatred a favorite.  Not quite winning her way into their hearts, Vien redeems a wife battered by her husband and her past (her father collaborated with the Germans) into kleptomania, an aging widower (John Wood) himself pining for a war widow (the war being World War I), a drifter with no sense of home (Johnny Depp - is there anyhting Depp can't do?), a crabby landlady (Judi Dench) facing a crabby death without her grandson, and other townspeople beaten into routine by the righteous Count.
With its picturesque locale and engaging story, ""Chocalat"" wins out over the prechy moralism of the script which is basically summed up as ""be human and enjoy it"" (the film culminates in an Easter sermon in which the boyish priest, writing without the Count's control for once, admonishes the town to think, not of the risen Christ, but Christ the man).  It's the routines of traditionlaism, the film implies, that prevent this.  The town's tranquility (I can't remeber the french word that the narrator repeats thruought the film) thinly veils its oppressive routine, but the film is so eager to please and slow to challenge its audience, that its own tranquility isn't as subtle.",980035200,5,3422,5.003521126760563
1286140,4,B00003CXR1,"Juliette Binoche is one of those very rare actresses who performs without showing it; she is warm, supple, appealing, radiant and simply intoxicating seemingly without effort. She is the perfect person to play the lead in this gorgeous adult fairy tale, directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who helmed Cider House Rules with a similar burnished glow. Virtually all of the players in this sentimental delight are wonderful, most notably Lena Olin, playing an abused wife, and Judi Dench, who once again is mesmerizing in a pivotal supporting role.  The movie's overall themes of acceptance, of accepting and changing one's destinies, and its Auntie-Mame sentiment, are light and woven expertly into the overall picture, which is fresh, well concocted and stunning to look at.  You will want to move to this fairy-tale French village, you will want to sip that deep, rich chili-peppered cocoa, and you will want to wrap your tongue around any of the dazzling chocolates you watch being made right before your eyes.",979516800,6,1004,5.115853658536586
1286141,4,B00003CXR1,"Bring the best, most indulgent chocolate you can find. It's the first thing I obsessively wanted after this film. Chocolate that just turns to liquid and is as smooth as silk. You'll understand.
The TV commercials are alittle misleading, one of the scenes shown isn't in the film. That really doesn't mattter. The cast is fun. Johnny Depp is grown up and I just had a good time.",978220800,2,378,4.573529411764706
1286142,5,B00003CXR1,"Rarely do films blatently announce themselves as fairy tales and then proceed to position themselves not for children, but for older audiences and adults.  The film's tone is reminiscent of a child's fairy tale, but the film has adult sensuality and a conflict regarding religious beliefs as well. It's also an English language film (in case you were wondering) with an international cast of Swedish, German, English, American and French actors.
The film is not all gooey sweetness and charm and refuses to play it safe.  It does not shy away from its sensuality and allows it's actors to show us more than one dimension of character.  Even the heavies are presented with a degree of compassion.  It's ultimately a romantic sensual film concentrating more on spirituality, fantasy and sensuality than on action, machismo and sex.  It is more a women's picture than a guy's movie.
I believe Chocalat will soon become a very much admired holiday themed film for teenagers and adults to watch year after year.  It's more of an Easter holiday themed film, since it is set during Lent in 1959 than a Christmas film however.  It's a film that is more than a war between the ideologies of paganism and Christianity, and concerns itself with the true meaning of compassion, acceptance and understanding.  It's a better film than it was a book.
We are introduced to the film with a brief voice over that begins Once Upon Time and shown  a remote French village, introducing a couple of it's characters.  There's an unfortunate over-use of some obvious CGI effects in the first establishing shots of the town.
The town is ruled as it has been for generations by a member of the de Reynaud family.  An ancestors statue sternly stands guard in the center of town..  We meet the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who insists everyone it the town observe weekly mass, and adhere to a formal belief in  Christianity. He's the richest man in tower, the mayor and he helps the new priest in town by editing and rewriting his sermons-which he will later use to help turn the townspeople against the newest member of the village. His wife however has been a long extended Holiday in Italy-perhaps not intending to ever return. (In the book, it was the priest who was the heavy-the change means we don't see a priest being tyrannical and hypocritical instead he's a pawn in another man's `war'. This isn't playing it safer though, it's opening it up to be more than a battle of paganism versus Christianity.).  The Count believes in leading by example, so he's hard on himself, barely eating anything during his Lental fast and certainly not sweets.
A mysterious woman named Vianne ( played superbly by Julliette Binoche)  and her child Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) appears as if traveling on a strong North Wind into the small town.  It is the way of these two. They have moved from town to town, sometimes leaving by choice, sometimes run out of town by a scared and fearful populace.  Vianne rents a long shuttered bakery from a crabby suspicious old woman (marvelously played by Judi Dench).  When the Count stops by to introduce himself to Vianne and invite her to church service, Vianne informs him she doesn't go to church.  When he frowns on the idea that she is going to open her bakery during Lent, she informs him it will not a bakery but only says what she is doing is a surprise.  The Count is shocked to learn that Vianne is not widowed, but has never been married.  He immediately is threatened by her presence and fears she means to challenge everything he stands for.  Does she?  It would seem not to be the case, but her presence is disruptive to the town.
Finally she opens a chocolatier, specializing in all kinds of exotic chocolates, some promising to cure headaches, lift spirits and even save marriages.  We learn Vianne has a secret Chocolate recipe used by an ancient civilization and passed on to her by her mother.  A mother who felt it was her destiny to share her chocolate with the world and now... so does her daughter.
How dare this brazen, unmarried, possible atheist woman open a decadent chocolate shop during  Lent !!!  Who does she think she is?  The Count  decides she is the enemy and must be banished from the town.  Meanwhile, she is winning converts... one of her secret chocolate recipes has brought passion back into a marriage, another has lifted up the spirits of her cranky old land-lady who then is re-united with her estranged grandson, and she befriends and then protects  the abused wife (wonderfully played by Lena Olin) of a tavern owner (Peter Stormare).  She even encourages a romance between old timers (Hugh O'Connor and Leslie Caron -yes THAT Leslie (An American in Paris) Caron.
Who is this woman who almost seems to be dabbling in witchcraft, is making some changes in the townspeople, has an illegitimate daughter and refuses to go Church?  What is her real agenda? Is she evil?
When a wandering band of Irish Gypsy river rats appears, the town quickly shuns them by order of the Mayor, The Count.  They can't legally kick them out of the town but they can make them want to go when they can find any odd jobs to get paid and they aren't served food or drink anywhere in the town. The leader of the River Rats (Johnny Depp) is accepted however by Vianne and a romance blossoms which further ostracizes her from the town and sets up a near tragic situation which leads to the film's conclusion.  It's not a completely predictable conclusion however-though certainly one which will please most audiences.
Johnny Depp in his supporting role as  Roux, has never been more relaxed, nor as effective as he is here.  He's even got a good sounding Irish accent which sounds natural rather than actor forced.  Depp's been getting some critical notices for many years and he's been good in several pictures, but usually his technique as an actor brings an aloofness to the characters he portrays preventing them from being completely believable.  I've enjoyed his performances but this is the first time he seems completely at ease and natural.
Director Lasse Hallstrom fresh off The Cider House Rules, and writer Rober Nelson Jacobs (from the novel by Joanne Harris) find the perfect balance of drama and comic whimsy to create a warm modern fable.
Like the best fables there's a gentle, simple sweetness to the tale which requires a strong suspension of belief in the viewer.  There's a naivety to the story and characters in the film which could only exist in a fictional world.  We aren't bulldozed into the films charms, and we aren't spoon fed its sweetness either.  There are some moments of bitterness as well.  The film realizes several perfectly realized little moments which gave me a sense of exhilaration--the type I have felt while watching films like Wizard of Oz or It's a Wonderful Life.  And while Chocolat isn't quite that good, it does come close in many ways.  It's a film I look forward to viewing and enjoying many more times. . . perhaps annually during Lent.

In doing this Ive found many movies I otherwise wouldve never given a second thought but have also discovered movies I wasted precious time on that Ill never get back.

This was unfortunately one of the latter. I watched this movie in its entirety and as time passed I began thinking maybe once Johnny hits the screen the movie will lighten up a bit but it turns out not so. He was in the movie maybe 15 minutes total and not even his incredible acting skills and good looks could lighten up the atmosphere of this dull movie.

The story has been told many ways. Yet this movie is still unique in its presentation. We get to visit with our favorite actors and they do such a good job that they do not overwhelm the characters. I especially liked Alfred Molina who played a similar role in ""Enchanted April (1992)"" as someone that really was not a bad person; he was just misunderstood or has a misunderstanding and comes around later to be really a good guy.

Like ""Babette's Feast"", everyone is supposed to shun Vianne Rocher who goes out of her way to help people. And like ""Like Water for Chocolate"", the movie has a mystical feel.

Basic story is a town where everyone knows their place and duty is visited by a north wind caring a mysterious woman and her daughter. Their present's wakes up the people from their organized existence.

1287840,5,B00003CXR1,"Such a lovely inventive fable of a rehabilitating chocolatiere, who rides into a medieval French town in a red cape, with a matching child, on a wily north wind!  Transforming a horrid dusty space into a magical chocolate shop, she begins to whip up her exquisite tantalizing confections, and tempt the town's inhabitants to pleasure themselves. Austerity here, under the stern watchful eye of the ascetic leader, is a longstanding virtue. This is a parable about good and evil, judgement versus acceptance, and pleasure dueling with its denial. Juliette Binoche, as Vianne, and Alfred Molina, as the Comte, are exceptional. All the acting is first rate, as are all the filmmaking elements. The storyline is so engaging that I experienced the intoxicating scent of chocolate throughout. The director, Lasse Hallstrom, as in most of his films, is particularly adept at working with a bit of magic-- both in the story and in his approach to it. It's such a pleasing, delicious film that your seeing it would be so much more satisfying than any further dissection of it.  A strong recommend.",1476662400,,1088,5.005524861878453

Juliette Binoche could not be more perfect as Vianne; Johnny Depp plays, to me, his most endearing character.  Share it with a good friend or watch it alone to give yourself a lift!

1290255,4,B00003CXR1,"Enjoyed the movie cinematography, acting and story line, but subtly anti-Christianity / anti-Catholic / anti-religion.  If you are a person of faith, watch the movie through the perspective of eyes of a person who has been hurt/damaged by judgmental religion, devoid of grace and love.  This is a back lash story line for someone who has experienced this in their life.  It should not excuse or accept a culture that is overtly anti-Christianity, particularly anti-Catholic.",1458259200,3,474,5.293333333333333

1291703,3,B00003CXR1,"I gave this film only three stars because of at least one very important error, which happened to be part of the entire premise of the film. Now, do not get me wrong, I am all for suspending reality and using ones imagination, but one can only suspend reality and activate the imagination when it is done in a plausible way (however creative that way might be - from rabbit holes to hobbits, it can be done, if done right).

Yet this film bases itself around the central idea that a woman opens a chocolate shop during Lent - how scandalous, right? Um, not really. This is where the entire foundation of the movie showed itself to be sand, and every step that it tried to build, so much of what I saw was it sinking into a hole of absurdity.

What Catholic, even a traditional one, would be offended by someone opening a chocolate shop during Lent? It makes utterly no sense! There is no Catholic dogma saying one cannot eat chocolate during lent - or cake, and cookies, and chocolate milk! (Using an old ancient recipe, based on Cacao - as she does - I am sure that she could, and probably would, come up with many recipes without animal products.) Whoever wrote this must have had a kindergarten understanding of Catholic dogma! How can anyone believe that an entire town would get so riled up because some lady opens a chocolate shop? If they did, I think they would get laughed out of town by the other Catholics, who would know perfectly well that there is no scandal in that. *Face palm*

It makes entirely no sense, and I do not understand how anyone can be expected to suspend reality when they would have to be in an entire other universe to do so. Lenten observances are left to the individual to be chosen. There are a few that were followed more in the old days than now, that is true, but never anything about chocolate or chocolate shops as far as an absolute requirement! It is absurd, and made the entire film seem like a sweet but strange joke. I mean, who were those people in that town? They threw out all of the heretics centuries ago the mayor claimed - but their offense at a chocolate shop would make THEM heretics indeed!

I suppose I should not be surprised that many people believed the premise enough to take the movie seriously, but for me, it was like watching a little old chubby lady parade around in red lipstick, lots of cleavage, and a slinky dress - thinking she is Grace Kelly, or some other timeless star. It would be cute and entertaining, but you would know the truth - that she is entirely deluded - and so you could never take her seriously. Maybe chuckle a bit at the absurdity, but you would never take her seriously if she tried to present herself as Grace Kelly.

And so this movie goes...there are no old ladies in slinky dresses, trying to claim that they are someone else, but the movie is the same nonetheless. Endearing in parts, and cute in many ways, but someone please - cover the symbolic ""old lady"" up!",1442361600,,2957,4.408424908424909

1291831,5,B00003CXR1,"In the category of movies that make you feel the joys of ""being human,"" this film has remained in my Top 10 for many years. I was glad to finally have it in Blue-Ray. It's a film that gently reveals how rigid and precast we can become in our opinions of others without ever questioning why we feel the way we feel. This film, without being accusatory, permits us to question why certain traditions,values and beliefs are blindly followed when in fact they bind us from being more receptive and free.",1441584000,,499,4.4945054945054945

1292056,5,B00003CXR1,"This movie is additive.  You can watch it over and over and not get tired of it.  The excellent soundtrack is a pleasant bonus to the amazing talented acting and the thought-provoking story. I thoroughly enjoyed Juliette Binoche's portrayal of Viviene.  And of course, Judy Dench is wonderful as the ""cranky old lady.""  Lena Olin is remarkable as the damaged wife who finds freedom and a new life.  Oh and it has Johnny Depp!  He isn't the main character, but he definitely adds a lot of spice to the movie. His character is thoughtfully and artfully played. The little girl is actually the narrator, as well as a lead character and is cast perfectly.  Her smile will warm your heart.
I love that the lead characters are strong women who struggle, battle and eventually overcome obstacles laid in their path.
The movie was made in 2000, but feels very timely with its theme of accepting and embracing differences.  Viva la difference!
I highly recommend this movie to friends and strangers alike.",1440028800,,996,4.783625730994152

I always recommend this to friends.  I believe it is my favortie Johnny Depp character and no one does characters the way he does.  Juliette Binoche is incredible as the lead , Judy Dench as always amazing and Molinaro sets the tone of the town.  Oh go on just watch it and decide for yourself.",1439942400,,466,4.179775280898877
1292058,5,B00003CXR1,"Having seen and loved it in a theatre at the time of its original release, it was a pleasant surprise recently to discover this gem of a film in Amazon's Prime Instant Video catalog.
The fine cast was very ably led by Juliette Binoche, unknown at the time to American audiences, with superb support from Alfred Molina, Judy Dench, and Johnny Depp.
The heart-warming story is a light-hearted fable that carries a serious message close below its surface.
High production values, excellent acting and direction make this film enjoyable and rewarding.  Highly recommended.",1439856000,,568,5.10752688172043

The movie suffers a bit from the tired old Hollywood condescension toward religion, but it is redeemed a bit by having Binoches character learn something from the townspeople as well. The resolution is a little too pat, but I was charmed enough by the characters that I was glad too see everyone get their happy ending.

Johnny Depp is a wonderful cast for this role and his guitar playing seems to fit in well.  Lena Olin truly shines in this film as she brings out so many facets of this side role with her incredible delivery of personalization that she made it into a major presence in the film.  The staging of this little French village was beautiful, and well-cinematographed.
The one thing that bothered me about this film was that Charlie, the dog, was fed chocolate liberally in this movie while the fact is that chocolate, along with grapes, is TOXIC to dogs and they should never eat it.  So the broadcasting media of this film should facilitate some kind of warning or parental discretion to prospective viewers.",1435968000,,824,4.7272727272727275

1293237,5,B00003CXR1,"I don't know why I'm surprised that I liked it so much. I guess because I could not think of how you could make an interesting movie over a chocolate maker. It was very well done - as much as I love Johnny Depp - he seemed a bit ""campy"". In fact, he seems a bit campy in a few of his movies - making it hard for me to take the movie seriously. I'm not sure if I'm imaging that or what - I never read that from other people's reviews. :-) But because I like him and his acting so much - it didn't really matter in the end. I enjoyed that there was no issue over the roles of Juliette and Johnny's characters - the usual issues of who is the bread winner, etc. The daughter in the movie was quite a wonderful touch, as was many of the other characters. Over all - if the movie had no plot at all (and it did) it still would have been good simply because they all did a great job and the scenery was great as well.",1431043200,,911,3.8253968253968256

Look at the cast: Juliet Binoche, Lena Olin, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp, Carrie Anne Moss and Peter Stormare, with excellent supporting players. The story follows a familiar pattern, but in an imaginative way. I will try to boil it down to its basic elements. I hope this suffices: this is one of those stories that, although fiction, feels true. It affirms our humanity on a basic level beyond words, and beyond the roles that we come to accept and submit to playing in our daily lives.",1428624000,,587,4.547169811320755

1293669,4,B00003CXR1,"I've seen this before but had forgotten what it was about and since it was rated well I decided to see it again.  I was not disappointed.  It contained three things that I like: chocolate, Juliette Binoche, and France (I think).  This movie has a storybook quality and although it is placed in Europe, everyone spoke English (no subtitles here).  I did like the fact that Ms. Binoche speaks English well enough.  I've seen her in other movies though not as nice as this one.  As a fan of foreign movies, sometimes the English language ones lose something in the translation be it the flow of dialogue or that the actors have to think in English and act at the same time.  Despite that, this is a movie nicely acted  by a stellar collection of actors (Alfred Molina, Judy Dench, Johnny Depp).  Nicely done.",1428278400,,805,4.534722222222222

The heroine is dressed in red and vibrant colors and the gypsy hero also stands out from the villagers. The questions about how the heroine gets the money to open a shop, let alone buy an incredible amount of chocolate to make ""professional"" desserts is, of course, never addressed.

1294320,2,B00003CXR1,"This movie preaches. It is a sermon, which sets up American-style individuality as superior to and a direct contradiction to the authority of God and the Church, very specifically, which is a strange object for its attack. When it could attack all sorts of troubling human tendencies, it instead makes the Church the enemy and every human failing ultimately the Church's fault. It exalts self-expression by means of any immorality or disregard of authority as completely acceptable, as long as the authority in question is either slightly ""sinful"" or slightly laughable. Juliette Binoche's presence is wonderful as always, but she and the rest of the high-calibre cast all seem mostly plastic, and one can blame the writing and the directing for this. They must have been aiming for a particular kind of plastic. If this is a sermon, it's one in which the supporting material is weak and the illustrations don't ring true, and they fail in their support of a troubling main thesis.",1425945600,3,981,4.987804878048781

1294903,5,B00003CXR1,"This is a delightful film  with great acting, directing, writing, and story.  Beautifully filmed on location in a small town in Burgundy, France. Besides Binoche, you have Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, and Carrie-Anne Moss in primary roles with smaller roles played by Leslie Caron (looking beautiful in her old age) and others with great skill.  Best of all, its directed by the incomparable Lasse Hallstrom who can't seem to make a bad movie.  I've loved his movies since My Life as a Dog and What's Eating Gilbert Grape.  The film was nominated for 5 Academy Awards and 4 Golden Globes.  Judi Dench won a SAG award for her performance.  The basic story involves Binoche as a mysterious, and a bit ""different"", woman who comes into town with her daughter and opens a chocolate shop during Lent which throws some towns people into shock while others are curious and secretly delighted.  Her impact on the townspeople and their impact on her unfold as the film moves along.",1424390400,,994,4.805882352941176

1294995,5,B00003CXR1,"A lovely French allegorical story of adventure and tolerance of those that do not share our views and values.  The acting is tops, the sets delicious and the little village just the right place for the setting.  The music composed for this film is typical French romantic, they type you would imagine taking place in Paris.

The main characters, Johnny Depp (Roux), Alfred Molina (Comte de Raynaud), Juliette Binoche (Vianne) , Judy Dench (Armanded Volzin), Lena Olin (Josephine Muscat) and  Carrie-Ann Moss as Caroline Claimant, are superb in their respective roles. However, Kudos go to the young actress Victoria Thivisol who plays Viviannes daughter (Anouk Rocher )who is constantly adapting to their nomad existence until she causes the final change by accidentally breaking the urn carrying her grandmothers magic ashes, which  made them wonder the world.

The story is one of control and intolerance of strangers those that do not share our values.  The Comte de Raynaud is the towns mayor and  patrician from a long line of privileged ancestors.  He is so strict that even his wife left on a vacation never to return.  Vianne and her daughter Anouk are unconventional and do not share the mayors strict observance of Easter and of the required church attendance and mounts an attack on Vianne and Roux, the Gypsy only to fall for the magical powers of Viannes chocolates.  It all ends with an understanding and acceptance of their differences.  A charming story that applies to todays troubled times.  I give the film five golden stars.",1423008000,,1544,5.007843137254902

She is able to show this by opening  a Chocoltierre.  This film is great fun because of the Moliere like farce that ensues. Johnny  Deep  adds an endearing roguish quality to his character.

1296354,5,B00003CXR1,"Do we define ourselves and our goodness by what we deny or by what we tolerate, by our restrictions or by our appetites, by who and what we exclude or by who and what we embrace?

This allegorical film portrays the contest between shame and fulfillment in a most engaging, well-scripted, and delightful way. A free spirit comes to town and opens a chocolate shop during Lent in a village bent upon maintaining a traditional order. What could this lead us to?

Juliet Binoche is at her best conveying delicacy of emotion and the supportive players each illustrate the permutations of the basic theme. In making the case for freedom-giving impropriety, this film challenges convention for convention sake, religious intolerance in the name of piety, and the arbitrary confinements of cultural traditions.

This film, nominated for five academy awards (including best picture), like its lead character is a sly wind that upsets tranquility with a spirit of vitality.",1415750400,,963,5.082278481012659

1296495,5,B00003CXR1,One of most delicious movies!,1414800000,,29,5.0
1296496,5,B00003CXR1,"This was truly a delicious movie to watch, no pun intended.  Set in a European town, the character played by Juliette Binoche is once again traveling with her young daughter, relocating.  Apparently, they have a history of taking root nowhere.  The delightful part is watching the mother set up her new Chocolate shop, decorating it, making the chocolate sweets and realizing the fact that this is not only her business, but the place where she and her daughter will live.

The atmosphere of the town is that of a small village where people go to church every Sunday and are scrutinized by the Mayor.  The Mayor holds disdain for the new proprietress of the Chocolate shop because she is unmarried with a child and does not go to church.  The Mayor is a bit too involved at church, in fact practically writing the sermons each week.

Although the Mayor tries to spread his propaganda to influence the townspeople not to patronize the new Chocolate shop, it attracts various townspeople.  These patrons are damaged or troubled, either by a bad marriage, estrangment from children/grandchildren, or just black sheep in general.  The proprietress of the Chocolate shop seems to have a kind word, patience, friendship and help in general for all these needy souls.  She makes a difference in all of their lives for the good, despite the negative efforts of the Mayor.

This was such a lovely rendered film that was very enjoyable to watch.",1414800000,,1435,4.840163934426229

Juliette Binoche is fabulous as a defender of the strength and integrity of women. Judy Densch plays a very gritty and tender role as a grandmother denied to see her own grandson because of her authenticity. And who can resist a movie with such delicious undertones about all of our favorite temptation? Chocolate what else?

This is certainly one of those tales of smaller scale, but still poignant relative to the characters. And a classic, solid, premise: into a little town where everyone knows what is expected of them and what will happen comes a stranger who will transform them all in her own unexpected way for each of them. It has a nice blend of whimsy, joy, fear, anger and disdain, compassion, and above all, people coming to accept change, both wanted and unwanted. The characters all have their quirks and whimsy, but not so much as they would seem an obvious caricature.

It is set in an ancient French village, there is no attractive tour sights there, no fashionable clothes, only an antiquate chocolatier and some conservative people. But it will make you believe in the power of rebellious soul, in the desire and craving for freedom and showing the true of oneself, and in the love, in the live, in the connection between people that is beyond family and friendship.

BTW, Juliet Binoche is a wonderful actress! I can feel her emotions, her sympathy for the village that she does not say, her great kindness and persistence through  the screen. This movie has got me fall in love with French so much.",1410739200,,774,4.521428571428571

Partaking of her deliciously rich chocolat is seen as a sinful indulgence. Anyone befriending the chocolat lady are also shunned by the towns people.

The acting was excellent.  But to my disappointment, the story line was about how much we miss, when we follow God given rules - and how we should rather prefer pleasure of all kinds.  The success of the story was in convincing a village to give up it's Lenten sacrifices and enjoy life instead.  I give you this...  Humanity was dancing and singing right up to the Great Flood, and very sure that Noah was a fool.  If those souls could speak to us now, they would surely have wished that they had given more time to sacrifice of pleasure than indulgence in it.  So, for me - this movie was a tremendous disappointment.",1409616000,,789,4.3493150684931505

So enjoy life and spread goodness and happiness onto others, in turn it will be returned.

The story is a little less severe and hard than it is in the book, but that actually makes it more relatable to the viewer.  The similarities to ""The Hundred Foot Journey"" are overwhelming:  same director, both food focused, both feature ""outsiders"" who are rejected by the dominant culture, both take place in southern France, both result in a catastrophic fire, both feature an underlying love story, both end up being accepted by the locals, and on and on and on.

1297752,5,B00003CXR1,"Delightful character study. All of the principles were very well-played. I especially liked Alfred Molina as his type of role tends to be very one-dimensional. But Molina gave the Conte some humanity and a real reason to be so controlling. He simply wanted things to be perfect. A movie like this could really make the church look bad. In this case, it wasn't the church that was off, it was rather the control of the Conte. Out of his control, the church went back to proper ministry. I found this show to be uplifting and mostly very family-friendly with a very brief scene of nudity and some implied sex but relatively little cussing.

1297901,5,B00003CXR1,"This is an exquisite movie - good story, wonderful acting, very fitting (and gorgeous) musical score by Rachel Portman. It shouldn't be too surprising, since it is a Lasse Hallstrm film. I have yet to be disappointed by his work, and ""Chocolat"" is as far from disappointing as one can get. As with other Hallstrm films, this one quietly tempts the best qualities of humanity out from under typically human constraints and fears. When a young woman and her daughter arrive in a staid French village to set up a chocolate shop, they find challenges at every turn, particularly with the mayor who sees Vianne (played so beautifully by Juliette Binoche) as a threat to the tranquility of village life. In her gentle efforts to free the villagers from their strictures so they can pursue their desires, Vianne learns that she may need freeing as well. Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Alfred Molina, and Lena Olin are among the true sweets in this charming tale.",1408406400,,967,4.831325301204819

The accents are as fake as the sets and the whole thing has a studio bound local drama club feel about it that really riled me. Lasse Holtstrum's made some really good films, but this highly acclaimed hit is not for me. Everyone in the cast has been terrifc in other films, but this isn't one of them.

Chocolat is Binoche's movie, she is in most of the scenes and her actions drive everything - she is perfect.  Molina is fabulous, as well as Lena Olin, Carrie Ann Moss, and Dame Judi Dench.  And if the cast and story is not enough for you, there is chocolate,  Everything is better with chocolate, and you will be better for watching Chocolat.",1407888000,,505,4.5054945054945055

1298143,5,B00003CXR1,"This is truly a hidden gem, a feel-good movie that speaks of the very basic need for people to be decent and loving with each other and to reach for the joy in life when it appears. Juliette Binoche's character arrives in a small French village in 1959 in the middle of Lent. The very conservative Roman Catholic community is both secretly inquisitive and openly appalled at her presentation of fine chocolates in the middle of the season of penance and self-denial, but she slowly wins over the villagers, although not without some drama that helps all the major characters realize what is important in life.",1407888000,,609,4.754716981132075

1298189,5,B00003CXR1,"The movie is at the same time simple and complex.  A woman and daughter move to a very conservative village in France.  The only difference between the newcomers and longtime residents is the way the live their lives.  The commonality is how the ""chocolat"" frees them both, allowing them to reconcile somewhere in the middle.

1298486,3,B00003CXR1,"If I had not read the novel Chocolat and fallen in love with it, I might have enjoyed this movie for what it is - a light romantic romp that doesn't convey any real depth of meaning. Despite the excellent cast, the movie misses many opportunities for character development, and changes so many plot details that sometimes the plot flow is simply disorienting. So many aspects of the novel were changed, distorted, excluded, or glossed over that if I were to list them it would be a very long list indeed. Some of the decisions made about these changes were simply unnecessary and even stupid. For example, why change Pantoufle from a rabbit to a kangaroo? Why split the character of the priest into two characters? Why deviate from Joanne Harris' description of Josephine Muscat as the woman in the tartan coat? Why change Vianne's back story? Why remove the elements of magic? Why change the name of the chocolaterie? The result, for anyone who loved the book and saw it come to life in their imagination while reading, is a vapid and meaningless pile of drivel.

The idea that the mayor of a small French village would turn against the opening of a chocolate shop was fascinating. By the way, if you like chocolate, you'll die for some of the wonderful productions created by the star of the film. The plot is simple. A woman and her daughter seem to move around a lot, starting chocolate shops in each new town. Then for one reason or another, they have to leave. Johnny Depp had a a very interesting character role in this film. I don't want to give away the story, but will say this one has a happy ending, too.

1299328,4,B00003CXR1,"This is a charmingly mystical tale though it deals with serious subjects such as wife beating, unwed mothers, paganism, Christianity and hypocrites. The unmarried Vianne and her young daughter literally blow into a small picturesque town in late 1950's France and open a chocolatier during Lent.  Juliette Binoche, as ""Vianne"" is well-cast, along with Alfred Molina, who plays the town rich guy and uptight master hypocrite, Judy Dench, the snappy and unhappy landlady, Carrie-Ann Moss, is her estranged daughter and Lena Olin, an abused wife. They play the major characters along a host of others, including gorgeous Leslie Caron.  Surprisingly, Johnny Depp's character is brought into the story fairly late in the scheme of things, but his character fit in well with Vianne's style. The story takes jabs at Pharisee-style religion which means the local villagers could have run the ""evil"" and possibly hedonistic Vianne away with pitchforks, but we are spared this clich.  But there is a dangerous fire and other interesting dramatic fare to keep the audience interested.

But Binoche's chocolat comes from a 2000 year old Mayan recipe with magical powers that liberate people (and animals) to pursue their heart's desires.  Judi Dench, is Binoche's diabetic Landlord, Lena Olin, an eye-catching but mis-cast troubled new friend who is transformed by the chocolat, and Johnny Depp drops by as a river gypsy and love interest of Binoche who appears disaffected by the chocolat because he is actually living his heart's desire. Take the Sound of Music and replace the music with chocolat, then place the set in  1959 France ... the town is alive with the magic of chocolat.

1299880,5,B00003CXR1,"Every one of the dry-as-a-leaf townsfolk in Mayor Comte De Reynaud's sleepy French hamlet ""...knows their place in the scheme of things..."" And if they forget their Christian values preached to them weekly in the stone cold church - the good Mayor is there to give the new young priest of 5 weeks (Hugh O'Connor) a helping hand with his sermons - and thereby get 'their' obedient flock back on the moral straight and narrow. Reynaud also waits patently and penitently for his wife to return from one of her interminable 'trips' - watched over his devoted secretary Caroline (the beautiful Carrie Anne Moss). But perhaps the hard-working and essentially decent Mayor (a fabulous turn by England's Alfred Molina) should just chill out and ""measure goodness by what we embrace"" - or maybe even recognize the lovely Caroline's devotion as genuine and worthy. But the Comte is too busy being pious and upright for the entire town - to engage in something that life-enhancing and delicious...

Besides that's the least of his carnal worries - because a sly wind is blowing in from the North - bringing with it a voluptuous woman of independent-mind (Juliette Binoche) who is going to open a decadent nay sinful chocolate parlour in Lent - a time of abstinence, reflection and tranquillity. And when this shop ""Choclataire Maya"" opens - Mayor Reynaud knows deep down in his starched flannel trousers that it will seduce the town - especially the women. And the next thing you know - they'll be shagging their husbands senseless again - leaving the drunken abusive ones behind (Peter Stormare as Serge) - cavorting with travelling river people who play guitars and talk in odd Irish accents (Johnny Depp as Roux) and generally enjoying all manner of lurid sensory pleasure. ""It's important to now one's enemy..."" the Mayor muses ominously.

Adapted from Joanne Harris' beloved novel by Robert Nelson Jacobs - Lasse Hallstrom's feature film (he also did ""The Cider House Rules"" - see separate review) garnished five Academy Award nominations - including one for Best Movie. And it's easy to see why. It has a magical and very visual story with fantastically strong parts for women. And it has chocolate - lots and lots of sweets, biscuits, cake and chocolate. You can get fat just looking at this film.

The cast is varied and uniformly superb: French acting and dancing legend Leslie Caron is an elderly town lady admired and longed for by Monsieur Bierot (a lovely show by England's John Wood). There's Judy Dench in full-on spiky mode as the ballsy old biddy Armande (nominated for Supporting Actress - her dialogue titles this review) who rents out the former patisserie to Mademoiselle Vianne (Juliet Binoche in luminous form). Vianne's dreamy daughter Anouk (a delightful Victoire Thivisol) plays with an imaginary kangaroo - but is tired of wandering from town to town with her rootless mother - prone to leaving in an instant when the wind tells her to go.

But as mum's culinary skills with South American cocoa and the dark evil liquid begins to affect the town folk in positive ways - especially a broken lady called Josephine (Lena Olin - who is Lasse Hallstrom's wife in real life) - the wandering Vianne senses that perhaps this hamlet is where her roots should be planted. In fact perhaps the town and its earnest but lost Mayor need her. And there's also the added enticement of that handsome rogue the Deppster to deal with - all gypsy and sexy shirts and dishevelled hair and good with her daughter. Easy to resist that...eh...

Defaulted to Aspect ratio 1.78:1 - the BLU RAY picture fills the entire screen (no bars bottom or top) - but is a strange mixture of the ordinary and exceptional. I suspect in order to give the movie that slightly dreamy feel - there is a soft focus on a lot of it - and subtle grain is ever present. But there are also moments that are truly beautiful when you least expect it - down by the river at night, the feast to celebrate a 70th birthday in the garden, Alfred Molina trying to turn Serge into a gentleman in his home. It doesn't ever look bad - it's just not as stunning as you'd expect such a sensuous film to be.

Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio Surround 5.1 and Subtitles are in English and English For The Hearing Impaired (a poor showing fro such an International film frankly). The Extras feature all the principal actors as well as legendary Hollywood Producer David Brown (Jaws, The Verdict, A Few Good Men).

""Chocolat"" is a classy piece of filmmaking - a sensory uplifting watch with passion truffles, cups of chilli-flavoured hot chocolate and Nipples of Venus.

Juliette Binoche is perfect in the lead. Johnny Depp is a major character but Juliette is the principle character. I love the storyline and how everything is resolved. This movie has a message and a good one at that. It's entertaining and sweet and I am always left with a good feeling after watching it.

and a pastor of sorts turns people the other way as it is a sin more or less to accept this woman.  It is very enjoyable to see someone overcome such pregidice and turn people around.  This gypsy woman who moves from place to place I can relate to as there really are gypsy's today myself included that move from place to place trying to fit in and make a home.",1390176000,,492,4.010204081632653

1300112,5,B00003CXR1,"A perfect cast for this quirky and very pleasant movie.  The mystery is never really solved even though we learn what the secret ingredient in the chocolat is.  One of the best actors of all time gives a very understated performance and never comes out of the character - Johnny Depp.  But I may also say the same about Judi Dench. The movie might be simply a four star if anyone else had played those two roles...then it would have had to be carried by the young daughter.  I would still be wonderful, just not as wonderful as it is now. You just have to love chocolate to love Chocolat.",1389225600,,588,4.318181818181818

Living her life as her mother did, a woman moves to town with a daughter--single, self supporting, independant, bucking the system.  One-by-one, she wins over the townspeople with her understanding (and her chocolate).  In doing so, she accidently discovers her own place in the world.  She must then either follow after a gypsy she fell in love with, run away to another town (again), or accept companionship and support from townspeople.
It's well acted all the way around, and of course, J Depp is fun to watch before he got so type cast and made up with the dark eyes.",1387756800,4,655,4.7105263157894735

1300185,5,B00003CXR1,"Juliette Binoche was convincing, and charming as Vian, the unique chocolatiere who wanders from town to town with daughter in tow because of her mysterious South American/French heritage.  She portrays tenderness, stubborness, ambition, and persistance very well.  Alfred Molina (shows the true range of his acting, especially if you've seen him in ""Frida) as the charming, exacting, rigid Comte (Count) and Mayor of this small town who regards religiousity if not compassion as a virtue and comes to find otherwise.  Johnny Depp, as always, is charming, fascinating and a wonderful counter for Vianne  Judy Dench portrays her crabby, diabetic landlady with great elan.  I wish I could make my holiday purchases from her chocolate shop.  Fun to see Leslie Caron (Gigi), now an older lady (still beautiful) in a cameo role!!",1386374400,,823,5.244274809160306

1300188,5,B00003CXR1,"This is a very interesting movie about an outsider comes to a small village and she is determined to win their respect by being herself, selling delicious chocolate, but this happened only with the help of a few outcast villagers.  They were outcast because they were different from the rest of the villagers.  They did not want to conform with the stupid, unsophisticated, unprogressive and close minded small town ways.  In the end she stays in the village because of the love and support she got from her new non-conforming, all inclusive, and progressive new village friends which were about only five of them.  I think she was very lucky she made five friends at this cookie-cutter village.  With her new little group of friends and her super skills of making delicious chocolate treats, she starts a new life here and the villagers started to accept her uniqueness.  This movie also address domestic violence issues, battered women and how a friend can help the victim escape and recover strength to move on from this horrible disease.

The town is very ridged and traditional and at first opposes the changes that she brings with her.  As the story unravels, the town's people start to give and their curiosity gets the better of themselves when relationships get tested and new beginnings come for many of them.  Judy Dench, Johnny Depp, and Juliette Binoche turn out amazing performances in a movie none like any other.

An unwed mother with a child comes to a provincial French village to open a chocolate shop during Lent of all things.  The Mayor of the town is not pleased, but the townspeople are enchanted by this compassionate, intuitive woman who metes out just the chocolate and advice they need.  She is able to change their lives, giving them exactly what they need.  Of course, the Mayor is furious that she is going against religious and moral protocol. He is uptight and frustrated.  But, with the aid of chocolate, she just may be able to win him over.

Inspired performances by Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina, and Judi Dench.  Johnny Depp plays a great rogue gypsy.  It is a movie based on a novel by Joanne Harris. There are some differences in story line but quite similar; the novel is worth reading, too.  I love movies in which characters are transformed.  This is a heart-warming and charming tale.  The scenery is gorgeous, too.  It was filmed in villages in France.

1300900,5,B00003CXR1,"Chocolat is a story about non conformists and the consequences of not fitting in.

The main character Vienne (Juliette Binoche) is born to wander, directed by the north wind, from village to village to dispense the ancient remedies of cocoa.

What's interesting is that cocoa can be used to suit various personality types and even solve sexual problems.

As Vienne declines to attend mass, it causes problems between her and the village Comte (Alfred Molina) who brands her an agent of Satan. Through her genuine interest in people and irresistible chocolate concoctions, Vienne wins over her landlady (Judi Dench) and a battered housewife (Lena Olin).

The real villain here is of course religious bigotry and the refusal to embrace diversity - represented by the Comte. He gets the town folk to shun Vienne and her shop and to even boycott immorality - in the form of riverboat pirate Roux (Johnny Depp). An act of vandalism is justified as an act of God. Very diabolical.

As more people flock to the chocolate shop, including the Comte's secretary (Carrie Ann Moss), the Comte is overcome with rage and jealously and there's a very memorable scene where he gives in to temptation. I personally think it's of the harmless kind.

I like the dinner party scene where the characters really savour the food, making it seem such a sensory and sensuous experience. Makes me look at food from a different angle. Chocolat is one indulgence you should not miss!",1358553600,,1455,4.894308943089431

1301097,3,B00003CXR1,"Eleven years after its release, I finally watched Chocolat. I laughed, I cried, and I cringed a little bit.

The premise is as human as it can be - how do people go about integrating someone different into their midst? Not so well, as it turns out. Juliet Binoche who plays the complex Vivanne is beyond stellar in her performance. Judi Dench - well, she's Judi Dench! Fabulous. Alfred Molina does a fantastic job at playing the highly unlikeable Comte and Mayor of the village, eventually showing his vulnerable side, and then finally giving in to it, becoming very likeable in the end. Lena Olin (playing Josephine) undergoes a similarly dramatic transformation under the loving acceptance (and chocolate) of Vivianne. Vivanne herself reveals more of her shadow self as the story unfolds, thus keeping her character interesting.

Of course I had heard about the uncannily steamy romance between Roux (Johnny Depp) and Vivianne (Juliette Binoche) and was anxiously awaiting this delicious morsel. Ah - however... Johnny Depp's character lacked the interesting intricacies of the other roles. But more importantly, his acting was tepid and his assumed accent was an abomination. It vacillated from Spanish-esque, French-esque, to Irish brogue, and sort of settled in the Irish range for the duration of the movie. Really? No language coaches? As the male romantic lead, he paled against Juliette Binoche.

Nonetheless, overall an entertaining and darling movie. Made me want to run out and get some really good chocolate.",1345248000,,1521,5.2
1301098,5,B00003CXR1,"JUST GLORIOUS....just a lovely movie experience especially on a cold rainy day under a blanket.  Chocolat is the most decadent thing that parishioners can do during the Easter season when no member of the church is to have any pleasures: so sayeth the town's mayor (a dictator) whose wife has actually left him quietly and serenely but he just can't accept that it has really happened because he has been so devout.  Judi Dench is just so Judi and we love her as the old broad her daughter wants to put away.  However, Judi's character has other ideas: she wants to live her life to her end no matter when it comes.  Just a lovely movie venture but then you know that already by the hundreds of delightul viewers and their votes.

You don't have to be a chocoholic to get the point!

Binoche is simply superb throughout.

This well paced film is an invitation to free ourselves from stereotypes, and enjoy what life has to offer. I don't know if Steve Jobs ever saw this movie, but he might have said it is an exhortation to ""be hungry, be foolish"".

We decided to rent it and agreed if it was really bad we would just stop the movie at the point we could no longer tolerate it. We were both pleasantly surprised when almost from the beginning we were at first interested and later delighted by this movie. The movie captivated us and after watching it I went online and ordered a copy from Amazon.

One of the nice things about rentals is the opportunity to examine before buying; sort of like a test drive in the new car your considering buying. Our test drive quickly convinced us this was a movie we would definitely want to watch again and one we would gladly add to our collection of favorites. Juliette Binoche is charming as Vianne Rocher, a single mom on a mission. Alfred Molina and Judi Dench are both perfect in their roles and as always Johnny Depp, who doesn't appear until later in the movie, adds his usual charm which is always welcome.

This is a special movie that does not easily fit into any of the typical molds; we found it refreshing and very entertaining. I suggest you give it a try and see what you think.",1333670400,2,1199,4.37219730941704

When Serge an abusive husband boycotts the ""river rats"" as Rue (Johnny Depp)brings a child with an upset stomach in need of a drink to his bar.

1301140,5,B00003CXR1,"The gypsy life has been a part of romantic folklore throughout history. Their strong characters, colorful clothing, and nomadic lifestyle, paint a fascinating picture for the staid communities of our society. This movie supports that frame of mind in a most unexpected and refreshing way.

The movie revolves around a mysterious woman who moves from town to town in the rurals of France, with her young daughter and cremated mother. Like a gypsy, she owns only a few things which she can pack up and carry with her wherever she goes. At the beginning of the movie, she and her daughter relocate to a quaint little village near a river. She sets up shop in the town square and goes about making the most amazing chocolate confections, using her mother's secret recipe, and selling them to the locals.

Then along comes a handsome young man sailing down the river, with a guitar slung over his shoulder. A gypsy in his own right, he moves from town to town along the riverbank, staying long enough to make a little money and stock up for his journey forward.

When Music meets Chocolate, it is love at first sight! The chemistry between Depp and Binoche grows ever stronger with scenes of necking on a houseboat in the moonlight, and images of floating candle lanterns, stormy weather, and arson. Nostalgia overcomes you as the innocence and sensuality of an older era comes to life on screen.",1320796800,,1391,4.739669421487603

1301186,5,B00003CXR1,"In short: A miracle! This new version which is 1080P 1.85:1 Widescreen (not 1080i as is the Canadian version and which I have not seen) fills the screen. The original DVD I always had a hard time getting the colors and contrast right. From my view point this movie was shot perfectly that depicted an old European town in available light. The colors were very much muted earth colors except for the reds(both hooded garments of the two main characters)and the lighting was so special in many ways. There is a lot of fog which adds to the back drop of this type of story. If only the DVD could do justice to it. This is probably the most difficult lighting to get right. But this Blu-ray does. I am a black and white photographer that is very aware of the importance of detail in the shadows. Many times, even with Blu-ray they aren't quite right. Often too contrasty but most of the time things can be very good. Some would say I'm fussy but I just have a standard I'm going for. I have an inexpensive LG Blu-ray player and also an LG screen that is not 720 but the true 1080 which does help in both details in shadows and the higher highlights. So with that I will say that out of all my Blu-rays this is the best transfer I've seen to date. The Pixar type movies are always good since they are originally in digital. The movie ""9"" whether you like the movie or not I think is the best of the bunch. The effects of the ""aura"" of the textures and colors have their own story that supports the story line: Like a good arrangement behind a voice. The Blu-ray of this movie is of that quality. The fog, all the many pastel colors, are defined but still soft. The skin tones are soft but distinct,and the way the tones and textures of various objects and scenery, that are at times enhanced or changed, are presented perfectly and now makes sense of why they did this. Each scene, for a visual type like myself, was almost distracting. I really have never seen the palette continuously before so well done in a movie:Art in motion. And....not artificial looking like some. The satin in those red hoods is terrific! When the chocolate is mixed in close-ups makes your mouth water.
The sound is in DTS (with a choice for Dolby 5.1) and is also delightful. When voices go out of the scene they are very carefully depicted moving off left or right. The sound stage has great depth to it and the separation in sounds helps the over all choice of music. The tone of the guitar is very clearly heard.
As far as a movie goes, separate from all this teckie stuff, I do think this is one of the best movies I know of. The acting is superb. The story line shows what rigidity does to ones' views. You can even see it in the light of today's political arguments and how when one side or the other becomes rigid in their view point something in the end must give.
Now instead of showing off your system with one of the Pixar cartoons, I would say this is the reference Blu-ray that will be hard to beat! I am so presently surprised. And cheap to. And one added note: This has the ability to save the place last played at. I don't even have to have the flash drive plugged in! You can eject the disk or keep it in. It has a provision that takes a few seconds but says it is looking for ""updates"" and then a box with the word chocolat comes up and gives you a choice to return to where you left off or not. This will become the standard I hope.
I hope this looks as good to you as it did with me. I know this sounds a bit over done but I really mean this stuff. I wouldn't take the time other wise.",1311120000,11,3579,4.21865889212828

1301191,2,B00003CXR1,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is inspirational, uplifting, visually enticing, and utterly appropriate for a feel good movie. It is also simplistic, predictable, stereotyping, and contains one dimensional characters.

First of all, the main character Vianne, is totally unrealistic. She travels from village to village and sets up a chocolate shop each time. How and where does she get the ingredients, not to mention, the ability to lug all her equipment is not explained. Throughout the movie, she constantly gives truffles and hot chocolates to the villagers in order to win their favor. Of course people want to be your friend if you give them free chocolate, but that is not a very sustainable way of running a business. And in a town where people have a moral bias against eating chocolate, it seems like you wouldn't have that much wiggle room to be buying pearl necklaces from gypsies, wearing nice clothes all the time, and serving four course meals to half the village for a friend's birthday. Realistically her part could only have been fulfilled by a rich woman selling chocolates as a hobby instead of an independent entrepreneur.

I was also disturbed by the essentialization of Mayan culture in the movie. The story of the movie is that of injecting primitive, passionate, spicy, sexual, natural pre-Columbian culture (by way of chocolate) into sensually deprived Christian European culture. This is hardly the truth about either culture and in a movie about tolerance and overcoming stereotypes, the movie's portrayal of these cultures reinforces conventional stereotypes. Even in the most conservative christian societies, countercultures of promiscuity, drunkenness, revelry, and alternative spirituality flourished and were often an accepted part of daily life. Western cultures for centuries have exoticized Asian, African, native American and pre-columbian peoples as noble savages that live in an Edenic state. The movie merely reinforces these traditional stereotypes.

My  third criticism of this movie is its simplistic message that indulging the senses solves Christian society's ills. If only people ate more chocolate then they would all be friends, have great sex, and become tolerant of outsiders. Especially in an age of rampant materialism and over stimulation of the senses, this is too simple a message for our times. Today, sugar is easy to come by. Over consumption of rich foods have led to obesity, short attention spans, and every kind of health problem out there. Young people  especially are motivated by sex, instant gratification, and stimulation of the senses as a way of filling the vacuum left by the absence of religion or spiritual meaning in their lives. A century ago, a dose of sensual gratification may have been remedy for our uptight grandparents, but today we see what a lives devoted to the fulfillment of instant sensual indulgence does for individual health, societies and the environment. At least an acknowledgment of this dichotomy would have made this film more than what it is, a simplistic, corn syrupy feel good movie that reinforces our preconceptions.",1299715200,,3118,5.26559356136821
1301262,5,B00003CXR1,"I was totally prejudiced against this film--must have been the hype around Oscar time some years ago--and refused to see it (As I recall, the ads, in typical Hollywood fashion, concentrated on the ""naughty bits""--which, in context, aren't!--making it seem as if the film were a tiresome piece of slush porn). The other day, however, as I was walking through the store with the big red bullseye logo and saw the DVD selling for $5.00, I thought, for that price, I might as well buy it. Well, I found ""Chocolat"" to be a delightful box full of delicious bonbons, a perfect pick-me-up for a case of the Winter Doldrums. I loved the characters (especially Judi Dench, and the children), the French village settings, and the spun-sugar fairytale atmosphere.

Fortunately, I had not read some of the more negative Amazon reviews. While watching the film, for instance, it never once occurred to me to look for the dastardly feminist liberal metaphors that some reviewers have intuited. I also realize that French villages are not really like the one in the movie. I took the film at face value, and, my advice is that you do so too.

The entire movie is richly understated and can be watched over and over.  Some might write it off as a somewhat off-beat romantic comedy, but it is much more than that.  It's a comedy in the classic, Shakespearean sense of the word, complete with a literal ""denier of the feast"" character (the mayor) pitted against younger, freer spirits (Juliane Binoche and Johnny Depp). Youth, as always in a comedy, wins out in the end as the mayor gives in to his repressed desires in spectacular fashion.  Don't miss this movie!",1286841600,,696,4.798319327731092

1301341,3,B00003CXR1,"I love little old French villages, Johnny Depp and chocolate....so I was willing to put up with a certain amount of nonsense to enjoy this film.  As they say, ""take the good and leave the rest.""

The ""good"" -- the lovely scenery and the cast.  Juliette Binoche is a charming actress who has made magic in other films; here...not so much.  Maybe it was the way the character was written but I found myself almost disliking her by the end of the film.  Judi Dench is always wonderful and here she does the best she can with a hopeless character.  Alfred Molina brings a one-dimensional character to life and deserves high marks for his performance. The child actress who plays Binoche's daughter is beautiful and successfully avoids being overly cute.  Lena Olin is ok as the abused wife who brightens up when helped by Binoche.  Johnny Depp has a small part, which is a shame since he steals every scene in which he appears.  He underplays his part beautifully which adds to his immense charm.  I liked his faint Irish accent, too.  It was lovely to see the beautiful Leslie Caron in a very small role.

From reading other reviews I get the idea that the novel from which the book is taken is presented more as a fairy tale than a realistic story.  I can see how that would work very well.  If the director had stuck to that idea the story would have gone down better. (no pun intended).  The opening scene with the two women blowing in on a ""sly wind from the North"" dressed in red woolen capes is very charming.

The problem is that the film is presented as real life, and that's where it begins to offend.  Instead of archetypes, we get stereotypes....the repressed, religious people of the town are all really nasty and hateful, whereas the free thinkers are the generous spirited ones with hearts of gold.  And chocolate heals all.  Several other reviewers have written some excellent critiques of this presentation and I recommend them.

The treatment of the Judi Dench character is another huge mistake.  She is diabetic but chooses to celebrate her birthday by indulging in sweets, which results in her death.  I guess we're supposed to think this is really ""gutsy"" and ""charming"" but it didn't sit well with me.  I could pick at other details which illustrate the mistaken ""morality"" of this sorry story, but I'll let anyone interested read some of the one and two star reviews.

Still, it's France and there is an attempt in the end to resolve the town differences.  If you have to see a sappy story, it's good to have lovely scenery and then get to watch Johnny Depp for a few minutes.",1282435200,3,2595,4.577006507592191

This is far from a romantic storyline.  I was hoping to see more of Johnny Depp in the film but he had a passing character that showed up mid-film, had a brief encounter with the main character, then disappears again until the end of the film.  The whole storyline is dull and pointless.  The main character opens a chocolate shop and the town is against it and the mayor goes through everything to sabatoge her store.  For what?  It's just a chocolate store not a strip club.  Who would go through all of that to close down a shop that sells candy?  I just found the story to be ridiculous.

That's how it tasted to me, anyway ... a pretty confection, like a chocolate-filled eclair, though the chocolate had just a hint of pepper. I might have preferred MORE food, a longer culinary build-up to the birthday feast that becomes the turning-point of the story. It's also a film in the vein of ""magic realism"" established by Latin American novelists. One can't help comparing it to ""Like Water for Chocolate."" That comparison does expose the shortcomings of Chocolat: there's not enough of the manic energy, there's nothing quite as funny or as poignant, and the acting isn't half as good. Johnny Depp is more mannequin than Man, more Hollywood pirate than Gallic gypsy. Juliette Binoche plays her role more as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother than as the half-Mayan sorceress she's supposed to be. Only veteran actress Judi Dench shows theatrical savvy -- control of her body, ability to express large emotions with a flicker of her eyes or lips, 'economy' of gesture and posture. She can act!

There are quite a few vitriolic one-star reviews of this film. Many of them compare it unfavorably to the book; since I haven't read the book, I can only suppose they have a point, but I don't much care. The film was a sweet treat, the sort of confection it's best to forget you've eaten lest you feel guilty about your waist-line or waste-time. Other reviews denounce the film as being hostile to religion, specifically to conservative Catholicism. They are correct. Vianne, the chocolate-sorceress, is indeed an atheist, though her stance seems mostly gratuitous. Her 'adversary' in the film is not the puppy priest but the repressed, hypocritical Count. Yes, the film can be taken as anti-clerical, and if you are fundamentally an anti-disestablishmentarian, you'd be wise to skip it.

Perhaps the best part of the film is the photography of the village near Toulouse. Yes, dears, there ARE villages in France just as picturesque and unspoiled as that one, and with any luck you'll find a celebrated gourmet restaurant there. Bon apptit!",1260662400,2,2080,4.991354466858789

1301440,5,B00003CXR1,"""The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies."" Okay. I don't have much use for chocolate, really, except for sippin' the occasional hot cuppa, and the cynical curmudgeon in me grumbles at the tradition of purchasing chocolate for your sweetheart (and don't even get the curmudgeon started on flowers). So I don't know that I buy into chocolate as a sort of universal panacea. But I did like CHOCOLAT, a film about sensuous magical realism and a shifting of status quo and the acceptance of things strange and new, and it's about romance and, of course, chocolat. The cynical curmudgeon in me just passed out.

Journey back to 1959 and eyeball that tiny, quaint French village down there. Observe the air of ""tranquilit,"" which for the purposes of this film is defined as staidness and, perhaps - no, definitely - repression. And also note the residents attending church, and that tamped down sense of vague discontent even as they worship. Then a heavy gust blows, and blows open the church door and also blows into town two red-cloaked figures which will change various lives before it's all over. I quote: ""A sly wind blew in from the North.""

The newcomers are Vianne Rocher and her daughter Anouk, and the tiny village is soon richer by the count of one humble chocolaterie, or a chocolate shop. As the movie audience promptly learns, the village's strings are pulled by the Comte de Reynaud, a pious gent who happens to be Mayor and whose wife may or may not be away on an extended holiday. As we also eventually learn, the Comte isn't truly a villainous soul, only that he believes he knows what is best for the community, this including observing Lent stringently and keeping at bay all things untoward and controversial. This last part, it would quickly dawn on the Mayor, would have to include tearing down Vianne Rocher, her business and her reputation. The Mayor would prefer his village to remain a sleepy one.

Vianne enjoys walking around in her red shoes and being la vonne vivante and demonstrating that joie de vivre, and that about drains my French lexicon. It's made obvious early on that the movie's central conflict will revolve around Vianne's free-spirited nature and the Comte's attempts to stamp down that liveliness and sense of freedom. She's friendly and that's fine, but, in her exuberance, Vianne also thumbs her nose at proprieties and gently mocks the Mayor (""Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?"" she offers him.). She ignores the village's religious structure (and, by that, I mean she refuses to go to church), opening her shop during Lent (a time of abstinence and sincere penitence) and orchestrating a pagan chocolate spring festival at the same time as Easter Sunday. So, no, the Mayor doesn't enjoy having his moral superiority tweaked. We see the Mayor admonishing Vianne: ""You don't misbehave here. It's just not done, did you know that?"" Whispers abound about whether she's a radical or even an atheist.

Meanwhile, Vianne does start making a few friends here and there, and her chocolate fineries are things of wonder. Vianne claims to know what sort of chocolate best suits her clientele, and this is the part where that opening sentence comes in. ""The Maya believed cacao held the power to unlock hidden yearnings... and reveal destinies."" Soon Vianne is doling out delectables and remedies, although, as in the best of stories, these remedies work their mojo in an indirect way. Throughout all this, the mayor is busting her chops. And it all gets a lot worse when the river throws up several boatloads of families and drifters. Except, for the movie audience, this is where things really kick up a notch, because at this stage Vianne goes from serving mostly as a plot vessel to someone infinitely more human and more riveting.

On board one of those boats is Roux, disarmingly, roguishly played by Johnny Depp, and he is, of course, Vianne's love interest. And, to play up the romantic tension, Vianne has a bit of trouble guessing which chocolate is right for Roux. Anyway, if one thought the Comte De Reynaud was unhappy before, imagine the state of apoplexy he achieves when river rats suddenly begin to sully his bailiwick. He can't say it aloud, but he's probably thinking: ""Sacr merde!""

As the movie progresses, we learn about Vianne's parents and how her vagabond mother set her about her wandering ways, traveling village to village at the whims of the North wind, dispensing cacao remedies. We learn the cracks in Vianne's irrepressible nature and we learn that her daughter Anouk is unsettled enough with the lack of stability that she's invented an imaginary kangaroo friend as a form of security blanket. So it's not a fairy tale life after all, following the North wind.

CHOCOLAT is a wonderful film, and makes me want to read Joanne Harris's novel, although, from what I understand, the role of the Big Bad was altered from being that of a priest in the book to that of the mayor in the film adaptation. Nevertheless, Alfred Molina is superlative, lending a depth and complexity and a melancholy to his character (see how forlornly he gazes at his wife's picture), elevating the Comte de Reynaud to beyond mere token villain status.

It's the feel of the thing which I appreciate the most, I think. CHOCOLAT feels like a charming fairy tale peopled with real life characters. The tone is right away established with the narrator's voice over (supposedly the voice of a grown up Anouk) and the two wind-blown figures in red. The cinematography is exquisite, the exteriors shot in France (the little village is post card picturesque!), the interiors apparently filmed mostly in England's west country and just outside London. And the musical score perfectly supports whatever mood is invoked onscreen. So, okay, I don't know that the dialogue is all that brilliant, even though I did like it. What I do know is that the words in the script are enlivened by a cast of marvelous actors. The battered housewife, the embittered landlady estranged from her family, the repressed lovely assistant of the Comte, the widow who may or may not be grieving over her four-decades-gone husband... these are characters who develop as they fall under Vianne's cheerful ministrations and are themselves empowered. As portrayed by Lena Olin, a sublime Judi Dench, Carrie-Anne Moss, and a still vibrant Leslie Caron, they each add memorable color to CHOCOLAT. I should mention young and talented Victoire Thivisol, as well. She plays Anouk, and she impresses me enough that I aim to look up PONETTE, in which at only four years old she won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival! How awesome is that?

But it all falls on Juliette Binoche, ultimately, and her delightful performance transports the movie to a wonderful viewing experience. Juliette is older now, and yet she's just as exquisite in her maturity. She seems more solid, somehow, than when she was taking on those sex goddess parts in earlier films. As Vianne, I've never liked her more. And she's still beautiful, her inner light keeps on shining. I think the word I'm looking for is ""luminous,"" although that description's probably been beaten into the ground.

CHOCOLAT is that same old package, really, done plenty of times and touting that same message, but this time it's presented with grace and a certain lightness. You get a smattering of romance. Quite a bit of prejudice. Religion, as a restricting engine, again gets a beating. The consumption of foods is just about equated to foreplay. And Johnny Depp plucks at a steel guitar. It's a fable that is comic and uplifting and also sensuous and passionate and excellently enacted. It's a fable, and yet it's inhabited with a core of emotional reality.

Now, if they were to make a movie about my favorite candy, that sucker'd be called... CARAMEL. Does the North wind like caramel?",1246924800,9,7922,4.8737936154417225

-----------------------
Vianne Rocher: And these are for your husband. Unrefined cacao nips from Guatemala, to awaken the passions.
Yvette Marceau: Psshh. You've obviously never met my husband.
Vianne Rocher: Well, you've obviously never tried these.
===============================

Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) sees her as a threat to the morals and tranquility the people of Flavigny-sur-Ozerain treasure. He starts a crusade against her, and against a group of vagabonds headed by Roux (Johnny Depp) who arrive by boat. When Vianne Rocher befriends them, a line is drawn in the sand:

-----------------
Comte de Reynaud: Let me try to put this into perspective for you. The first Comte de Reynaud expelled all the radical Huguenots in this village. You and your truffles present a far lesser challenge.
=============================

But to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, ""I can resist everything, except chocolat.""

I like everything about this film, and everyone in it is chock full o' talent. Somehow, though, the whole was equal to less than the sum of its parts. And less was not more, less was less. Was it too many cooks spoil la mousse au chocolat? This was an attempt to create a fable, and that is a very delicate thing. Like a chocolat souffl, someone slams a door and the whole thing collapses. Maybe it was just me. Your mileage may vary.

Speaking of fables, Edward Scissorhands, for me, now, there was a fable. Johnny Depp was fabulous in it. Sometimes you can't create a fable, you just have to use your divining rod and find one. Sometimes the magic just doesn't work, especially when you set out to create a fable. Chocolat is magic, but too much chocolat is just an overdose.

Lasse Hallstrm made this after The Cider House Rules, and as they were filming, they learned that they had 7 Oscar nominations, and would win for Michael Caine, best supporting actor, and the script by John Irving. Chocolat would also garner five nominations, but no wins. Lasse Hallstrm is married to Lena Olin, who plays Josephine in Chocolat.

I don't fault him for that, or think it adversely affected the film, I just mention it because you can tell that everyone is having a great time making the film, Chocolat. They are literally making chocolat, and eating chocolat, too. It is a family affair, with old friends reuniting, and new friendships being forged.

Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin both appeared together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where they were two corners of a love triangle with Daniel Day-Lewis. Olin played Sabina, the one who wore her grandfather's derby while making love.

Lasse Hallstrm had worked with Johnny Depp before, when he directed him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? In Chocolat, Johnny finally gets to play guitar, and we hear him do some blues and Django Reinhardt's Minor Swing. It is a real treat to hear Depp play Le Jazz Hot, and he is not half bad. He has some great vintage guitars and a Dobro.

Peter Stormare is great as Josephine's husband, a wife beater. He is not quite a scary as he was in Fargo, but he is scary enough, and also a little sad. Alfred Molina is kind of an uptight wet blanket, but you can see that he is just an insufferable self righteous buzz kill because he is sad. Nothing that a little, or a lot, of chocolat won't cure.

---------------------------
Vianne Rocher: [to the Comte de Reynaud] Ah, good morning. Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?
==============================================

Judi Dench is fabulous, as usual, and so is Leslie Caron, though her part is so small I didn't even notice her. The director apologized that her part was so small. She was in Gershwin's An American in Paris with Gene Kelly, directed by Vincente Minnelli. She starred in Lerner and Loewe's Gigi with Maurice Chevalier, also directed by Liza's dad and Judy Garland's husband, for goodness sake! I haven't even mentioned Daddy Long Legs with Fred Astaire! Leslie Caron is a legend of the silver screen!

With all the fabulousness on display, you'd think that they could create a decent fable.

1301445,5,B00003CXR1,"This is a poetic, visually stunning movie with quite a number of really good feamle roles, fine performed. There is so much poetry and magic, the movie reminded me of Latin American literature very much. The same sense of marriage of the real and the unreal, coexisting in harmony.

A young women, (who is also a single mother),a daugther of an European  man and a Mexican curandera, arrives in a small traditional town in France, during the time of Lent . Not only she dares to open a chocolate shop during this time, but in additon her creations are considered kind of excentric, the same as the decor incorporating artifacts showing clearly Precolumbian heritage. The chocolate store owner breaks routines people had so far, and she is also able to help people hwo have psychological problems, healig human relations. But her otherness is not welcomed at first, people are distrustful, and she is a percived threat to their traditional ways. But they slowly warm up to her.

But there is a problem: the local aristocrat, a count who enjoys to infulence the life in the town, is hostile toward the newcomer, and has a very strong influence on the local Catholic priest. The count is anaware how bad his plotting is, until one day he is faced witt the  results. A sad story about a strong, dominant persoanlity and weak, gulible folowing. But in this conflict, clash of two cultures, one traditional and one alternative, and the opposition bewteen the  creative and the routine, it is the other, the revolutionary is the side which will be victorius. The count is hostile, she just lives her live according to her conscience. And we sympathise with her right away.

This movie is touching deeper societal problems, yet is very entertaining. The main focus is xenophobia, but also the appreacaiton of learnig across the cultures, and the need of positve influeneces of variosu kinds: will be this another culture, or just a different personality, or different kind of thinking. This movie, becasue is so poetic, (but maintains the integrtity of the story), is an ode to an opend mind. A movie a to enjoy and savour, a bitter-sweet one. And Juliette Binoche is wonderful as always.",1242086400,,2180,4.831099195710456

This movie had a little bit of everything. Comedy, drama and a love story.
I recommend this movie.",1234396800,,157,4.096774193548387
1301449,1,B00003CXR1,"Before I get hit by the first rotten eggs, let me state that I am a foreigner living in France who likes good chocolate and finds lots of it in this part of the world, who buys his wine in the Gers region, somewhere near Lansquennet-sur-chose, in that beautiful part of France between Bordeaux and Toulouse, someone who has often walked along trails others have avoided - yet I feel that this is a lousy movie.

The problem with this film is that it cannot make up its mind as to whether it wants to be a fairy tale or a political pamphlet and the rivalry between these two objectives makes for a lot of jarring noise.

It starts out as a fairy tale with two little red riding-hoods, mother and daughter, arriving in a kind of petrified town.  Their vocation seems to be the deliverance of the population from their self-imposed (senti)mental sklerosis by means of a magic drug, presented in a variety of forms to suit the various symptoms of the disease.  A little pepper-laced chocolate will help a desperate housewife, for example, to revitalize a lazy husband.

To make sure the spectator understands the message of the movie, the characters are presented in the most exaggerated manner.  The good people are frighteningly good, the villains ridiculously villainous, the artists wonderfully artistic.  This, then, makes it easy to include a few subliminal messages aimed at promoting the pleasant idea that the ultimate goal of our life is enjoyment.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is tarred and feathered - a rather unpleasant treatment even if the tar, in this case, is chocolate syrup.

Such a fate actually awaits the mayor of the town, a real model of a hypocritical brute whose family has been ruling the area for hundreds of years (the French Revolution notwithstanding) and even went so far as to drive all those gentle, fun-loving Huguenots into exile, back in the 17th  century.  He faults little red riding-hood for setting up her business during lent, he edits the sermons of the young priest (who is actually a very nice chap and later revolts) and he is behind a pogrom organized against this bunch of foreigners who come drifting down the river with their house-boat and dare throw a party during Holy Week.

The experienced movie-goer has been waiting for such an explosion to strike and just did not know whether the chocolate shop would be blown up or the house-boat set on fire.  In the end it is the house-boat, with the two lovers (little red riding-hood and one of the drifters) inside and but for the grace of God (if there is one) our valiant patissire is saved from drifting out of sight like Ophelia in a pre-Raphaelite painting.
It all takes place in an imaginary setting, unrelated to anything in the real France, the chocolate shop is mysteriously dark, the town frozen in stone without any sign of vegetation and with the church spire looming up at the end of every street like a watch-tower at Guantanamo; actual life can be found only down by the riverside where the trees are green even in early spring.

And the actors?  The men obviously suffer from the greasy hair that is de rigueur for a film set in 1959 and thus look a little silly, be they the friendly tramp or the ugly mayor.  Juliette Binoche, pretty as a picture, apparently brought along, in her little suitcase, a whole collection of evening dresses to wear when mixing her wares or when divining the secret wishes of her customers by means of a magical disk that once belonged to a Maya priest.  There is Judi Dench, wonderful in the role of the mean-looking but kind matron who owns the patisserie; she is not afraid of making herself look old, something that really makes her a good actress.

But for all the actors' talent and their efforts, this film is miles away from the poetry of ""Babette's feast"" or the highly recommendable farce ""Le bonheur est dans le pr""; this latter film, by the way, is set in the real Gers region of which ""Chocolat"" is only a poor pastiche.",1233360000,19,3974,4.652857142857143

1301511,2,B00003CXR1,"My criticism here is about the issue of chocolate. This movie must have had backing by Ghirardelli chocolate, because it seems to be an obvious plug for selling more chocolate. They made it sound like chocolate is good for you. Well it is, the way the Mayans drank it. Nowadays it's loaded with sugar and butterfat, which we're all now finding out how serious the damage is from refined pollutants that sends your adrenals on a roller-coaster ride.

Don't believe the sugar-coated acting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche, they're mainstream people who don't understand the messages they have the power to produce. Sure, I sound like a whiny party-pooper, but then, someone had to say this.",1231891200,,692,4.914529914529915
1301512,3,B00003CXR1,"This movie follows an increasingly common theme.  Men are pretty much all pigs.  The only meaningful intimacies are between women.  The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching.",1230854400,2,345,5.84

1301514,5,B00003CXR1,"Loved this movie.  It's cute and simple, yet has a lot of messages about life and people and religious dogmas.  Total chick flick.  My boyfriend didn't make it through.",1226793600,,168,4.724137931034483
1301515,4,B00003CXR1,"Based on the novel by Joanne Harris, the film ""Chocolat"" takes a lot of liberties with the book's story, but is still a very good film. The movie revolves around a mysterious woman, Vianne (Juliette Binoche), who arrives rather suddenly to a remote French village with her young daughter in tow. Vianne quickly settles in and establishes a chocolate shop, which instantly becomes the talk of the town. While certain people are intrigued by this fascinating woman and her sinfully sweet candies, other townspeople see Vianne as an immoral person who threatens the village's core principles and values. When a band of ""pirates"" (a.k.a. Irish gypsies) arrive in town, Vianne immediately befriends their leader (Johnny Depp), causing other people in the town (especially the mayor) to resent her even more. Eventually Vianne is tempted to flee again in search of another new start, but this time she may have found something worth staying and fighting for.

As I said, there are some major differences between the film and the novel. Usually when filmmakers deviate from the books their films are based on, they end up with a gigantic mess. However, that isn't the case with ""Chocolat,"" which is an endearing film with a wonderful cast. I highly recommend it.",1225843200,2,1255,5.0047846889952154
1301516,5,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat,"" in my view is all about grace.  The most gracious, and therefore, most appealing characters, are surprising, because their histories do not necessarily lend themselves to producing such winsome people.  The characters who should be gracious - because they have ""sort-of"" connections with the God of grace, are judgmental, legalistic and mean-spirited and wound-too-tightly.  Hence the tension in this film is nearly palpable.  I recommend it highly.",1224806400,,461,5.735294117647059

All of the scenes of chocolate making, stirring, serving, etc. are wonderful. The story is very good too.  Well worth watching and savoring!",1221696000,4,316,4.413793103448276
1301519,5,B00003CXR1,"There are a few movies I believe approach perfection: The Princess Bride, Errol Flynn's Robin Hood, Meet Joe Black, Young Frankenstein. If you're still reading, watch this movie. It has that 1940's look and pace, and the great classic acting earlier films often contained. It has a thoroughly modern sensibility, however, in the way the story is told and the depth you see in the characters. Reviewers often use the word ""gentle"" to describe this movie -- but the issues it deals with are nothing of the sort. You'll have to watch for yourself -- but I believe you'll feel better about the world when you've done so.",1221350400,3,616,4.712962962962963
1301530,5,B00003CXR1,"This is a tale of what happens when the morality police get their judgments completely wrong.  Still the movie makes it's point without clobbering viewers over the head.  The movie, set in the mid-1900s, stars Depp as an kindhearted ""pirate,"" and Binoche as a nomadic, chocolat making, single mother, (who is also step-mother to a ""kangaroo."")

The juxtaposition between characters main and sub, old and young, religious or not, is interesting to follow each has their own unique story to tell.  Though set before my time, the movie's themes feel relevant long after the closing credits end.

The scenery and soundtrack are wonderful start to finish and the movie's gentle, but steady flow is a joy to watch. This is a perfect date movie and yes, you will need a fireplace, some premium chocolat and a bottle of good French wine.",1220832000,,829,4.851063829787234
1301531,5,B00003CXR1,"I love this film. Juliette Binoche is a joy as the town's newest resident, and her open ways are very foreign to some of her neighbors. Judi Dench is, as always, terrific. From a very personal perpective, Johnny Depp shows up too late in the film, but, as always, lives his role. This may not be a great film and some may feel it is hitting them too hard pointing out people's prejudices. But people do have them and it never hursts to remind us to look beyond the surface. Tjhe film does not treat dogmatic religion too kindly--but I don't have a problem with that.",1219622400,,566,4.349056603773585
1301532,4,B00003CXR1,"Maybe there isn't much difference - but Vianne's is more magical than most. She spends her life as a wanderer, bringing with her chocolate recipes that descend from the Mayas, but with preparation to tempt the most refined Europeans. The story starts when she and her daughter wander into a small city in France that dates back to the middle ages. It's a walled city, filled with walled people, the kind affronted by opening a chocolate shop during Lent and nastily eager to note the mother's never-married state.

But, with a lot of determination and a little magic, Vianne wins them over, one palate at a time. As she helps bring people together, heal rifts, and create second chances for the townspeople, one wonders why the charm doesn't work on her own life. Then, Roux (played by Johnny Depp) appears, even more of a wanderer than Vianne. Instant affinity arises between these two roamers, but instant enmity comes from the deep-rooted locals - how dare they not live lives as staid as the villagers' own?

Based on chocolate, you just know that this has to end up as a feel-good movie; I'm not spoiling any surprises there.

It was a great study in love and acceptance as portrayed by the main character in the video.  As a professed non-religious person, Vianne showed many of Jesus' values so clearly depicted by his actions and parables.  Her non-critical acceptance of Armande and Josephine had much in common with Jesus' acceptance of Levi the tax collector (Luke 5:27-32) and the prostitute who washed his feet with her tears (Luke 7:36-50).  CHOCOLAT is a complex, multiple-subplot story very well done.  No wonder it won five Academy Award Nominations.",1203206400,2,703,5.241071428571429
1301632,3,B00003CXR1,"A religious, small town in the French countryside receives newcomers Vianne (Juliette) Binoche and her daughter.  They come dressed in red, and soon open a chocolate shop across from the church on the first week of Lent.  Scenes of  townspeople in confession describing the delicious chocolates are meant to be titillating.  Chocolate treats from the new shop is described sensually with double-meaning, including sex and other sins of enjoyment.

The mayor launches a campaign to get rid of the new chocolate shop that is causing so much excitement in this once sleepy little village.  Then the children see ""pirates"" along the river and Vianne's daughter runs to her mother announcing the landing of the swarthy crew.  It is a band of Irish river people and headed by a handsome Roux (Johnny Depp  - who plays pirates well).  The beautiful Vianne and the handsome Roux become romantic as they understand each other as outsiders and agents of change for all they touch.

""Chocolat"" is a sweet movie, but trite in that  it suggests that all a person needs to liberate their soul, forget all the wrongs done to them, and become happy is a piece of candy.  There is a ""leave it to Beaver"" feel to the movie - too perfect, and the dialogue is often boring.  Judi Dench plays a role as a local diabetic who does not want to give in to her disease.  She keeps eating the sweets and enjoying life despite her critical condition.  I felt pain in all the actors trying to keep a French accent going - it did not come naturally for most in the film.

Overall, enjoyable and more of a ""chick flick"" with a sweet chocolate shop princess and a swarthy pirate to bring it to a Disney ending.",1202601600,3,1678,4.5993265993265995

We like Depp but he seems out of place. (For a wonderful, also slow, but unerring Lasse Hallstrom film, consider 'An Unfinished Life'.)

Lasse Hllstrom makes a beautiful  cinematic fable out of this endless human dilemma in ""Chocolat"". A wonderful, moving (and surprisingly fun) movie to watch. Not only it features a great and magnificently-ensembled multinational cast which includes Johnny Depp, Carrie-Ann Moss, Lena Olin and even divine Judi Dench. It is the subtle, heart-felt approach the director manages to convey to such a deep and thick story line. It makes us think and reflect on how Humanity deals with changes and innovation as opposed to rigidness and prejudice-filled attitudes within the often stiff and unmovable boundaries of wrongfully implemented morality schemes. Vianne Rocher (beautifully portrayed by Juliette Binoche) is a sort of  magic-embedded ""Mary-Poppins"" with exotic roots, who travels along towns establishing impromptu chocolat stores, along with her young daughter Anouk. This time the cool northern wind brings her to the little French villa of Lansquenet, where life appears to have not changed a bit in a hundred years. She opens a chocolate store much to the dismay of the self-procclaimed town's moral police (Count de Renaud, played by Alfred Molina). But rather than challenging the rigid and linear morality parameters in town by way of sensuous and forbidden pleasures, Vianne and her tiny little chocolate place in reality will slowly (but fiercely) establish a much needed paradise of simple and plain tolerance for the villagers. She will start winning the town over not only with her magic recipes for the most delicious chocolate treats, but also with her honest and sincere ways for dealing with the everydays of human nature and understanding of real people.

Making a movie about chocolate, the one guilty pleasure that transcends age, gender and race, is an idea in itself, but making that film creamy, sweet and pure is something all its own.  `Chocolat' tastes so incredibly sweet on the viewers palate, a film that coats our eyes with its rich goodness and makes us crave even more of what this beautiful film has to offer.

Okay, enough with the obvious chocolate innuendoes.

All kidding aside, `Chocolat' is a wonderful film, one that I never expected to like as much as I did.  My wife had seen the first part of this film some time ago and reported that it was horrible and thus she turned it off.  I must admit that the advertisements and posters for the film failed to draw me in (although after seeing the film and casting glance at the poster I can't see how Binoche's smile didn't draw me in at first glance) and so I accepted her complaint and tossed aside all aspirations of seeing the film even though my wife has significantly lower taste in film than I do and I generally reject any and all of her opinions on movies.  Now the other night, late at night I must add, this little film came on the food channel and I decided to watch it.  I only caught the first half hour before sleep overcame me but that first half hour was, in a word, spellbinding.  I insisted that my wife give it another try and so we rented to film the following day, and while she is not as intoxicated with this film as I am she readily admits that her initial response to this movie was wrong.

The film centers around Vianne Rocher, a mysterious woman who moves to a reserved and very religious French town with her young daughter Anouk.  The town, about to observe Lent, immediately turn their backs to Vianne as she opens her chocolatier and tempts the townsfolk with all that they have vowed to abstain from.  No one opposes her more than the uptight mayor Comte Paul de Reynaud who comes to despise Vianne and everything she stands for.  He watches his power over the town slip from his grasp as they all begin consulting Vianne and falling prey so-to-speak to her chocolaty deliciousness.  Yes, Vianne is just as delectable as the chocolates she makes.  Her smile alone is intoxicating.

The film is lovely to look for the cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is brilliant as well, from Binoche's devilishly sweet performance to Judi Dench's crotchety Armande Voizin to Alfred Molina's malicious Comte and Lena Olin's mysteriously beautiful Josephine.  Everyone involved here delves into their characters and delivers beautifully.  Johnny Depp has a very small role although it may seem from advertisements that his role would be larger.  He's effective but no where near as memorable as the remaining cast.  Carrie-Anne Moss delivers a nice little performance here as Armande's cold hearted daughter and young Victoire Thivisol manages to make Anouk a real girl, immature and foolish yet with a sense of maturity that would accompany her situation.

I don't know if this would be constituted a spoiler, but I wanted to talk a bit about Pantoufle since I feel he is really the moral center of the film.  When the film opens we are introduced to Pantoufle, Anouk's imaginary friend kangaroo.  He is wounded and cannot leave her side.  At the end of the film Pantoufle is healed and bounces away from the town, and Anouk is happy for this.  Throughout the film mention is made of the fact Vianne moves around a lot and she even mentions herself that while she tells herself it's good for Anouk she knows in her heart that Anouk hates it.  To me Pantoufle was a metaphor for this very fact.  Anouk longed to stay put, thus the fact that Pantoufle could not leave her side.  He was wounded and thus could not travel.  She wished that she too could not travel but could experience some stability.  When she finally receives that stability at the films end she has no use for Pantoufle anymore for she has what she wants and so her subconscious sets him free.

So, in the end I must say that I LOVED this movie, truly adored it.  It made me smile and rarely do films do that.  Maybe that's because I often seek out the film that depresses and saddens me because I enjoy the emotional connection to cinema, but it's nice to watch something that brings a smile and sense of joy to the soul, and `Chocolat' does just that.",1196640000,,4451,4.557232704402516
1301670,4,B00003CXR1,"This movie is likeable and thoughtful and fun, and obviously Johnny Depp fans will be interested in it, even though his role is small.

1301671,5,B00003CXR1,"One of our family's favorite films.  It's got it all, Johnny Depp never sexier, a splendid story, a lovely setting and plenty of amazing chocolat.  Beautiful European village, exotic tale, and one of the finest incidents on film of temptation and indulgence with chocolate ever.  There's a variety of story lines all woven together smoothly even with back tracking to explain the nomadic lifestyle of the mother and daughter.  On top of that, an intense story of marriage and how to do it right and do it wrong and the tales of healing and changing that wistfully flows from the magic of an ancient people.  Just a wonderful tale.

We've watched this again and are glad we own it.  Makes me wonder if this director has any other magical films.  A moral to the story and everything.  Extremely well done.  Buy it.  I would imagine almost every gal would swoon over Mr. Depp.  And it's not strictly a chick flick at all.  Something for everyone, say for ages 10 and up.",1195862400,,967,4.584795321637427

1301675,4,B00003CXR1,"Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) glows as Vianne Rocher, a free-spirited young woman that the wind blows into a small, morally obsessed and oppressed French town one day. Using an ancient Mayan recipe discovered by her father, she and her daughter have come there to open a chocolaterie. Her confections are out of this world, and she uses them to try to help mend the various broken people and relationships in the town. But the mayor (Alfred Molina - Spiderman 2), whose family has dominated the town for centuries and who fears she will lead the townspeople away from their traditional faith and mores, declares war on Mademoiselle Rocher and tries to turn the townspeople against her.

One by one she gains allies, first in the form of her landlady, Armande Voizin (Judi Dench - Shakespeare In Love, Pride And Prejudice) and her grandson Luc Clairmont (Aurelien Parent Koenig - debut), which infuriates Luc's mother, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss - The Matrix), who has forbidden him from seeing his grandmother. Then she gains a battered woman (Josephine Muscat - The Ninth Gate), whose husband (Peter Stormare - Fargo) the mayor tries to reform in order to prove that his way of changing people is better. It doesn't work. Johnny Depp doesn't appear until the second act to reinforce Vianne in her cause and to offer romantic interest. He and his river gypsy friends are also considered undesirables by the town.

What's interesting about this film is that the Christian townspeople are being held hostage by the self-righteous, morally oppressive mayor, and consequently Vianne acts more like a Christian than any of they, even though she is not a believer. She takes a genuine interest in people and tries to help them with her friendship and chocolates. The mood of the film is magical, though magic has nothing to do with it - it's really about love. The question is, will love win out before Vianne gives up and decides her cause is hopeless?

This film is rated PG-13, which is a shame because, if several scenes that are not critical to the story had been toned down or left out, it would have made a wonderful family film. It has a story-book setting and feel that would appeal to any age. Unfortunately, several scenes push it into the category of adult romance. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful story about love in the face of prejudice that all of us need to hear, as well as enough chocolate shown onscreen to satisfy any chocolate lover's craving.

1301676,5,B00003CXR1,"Johnny Depp, need I say more? Okay for those of you who arn't a fan of his, there is more, more indeed.

This movie is a recipe with all the right amounts. Suspense, romance, humor, depth, characters with layers.

This movie isn't simply about one of the most loved desserts of all time but what it represents. This movie is about prejudice, desire, temptation, religion, secrets, determination, and what happens when you are under the microscope.

Things are not what they always appear, are they? Well you'll have to watch to find out.

The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a  shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.

1301753,3,B00003CXR1,"First, let me start this review by saying how much I adore chocolate (the food).  I mean, there is a reason that women love this stuff.  Personally, I would even be so bold as to say I prefer my chocolate dark and bittersweet (I can get more antioxidents from this, too--another incentive).  Now, moving on to the movie.  How would I describe CHOCOLAT if I were to compare it to a bar of the dark stuff?  Well, I can't say it tastes authentic.  My favorite type of chocolate isn't even European, or French, for that matter.  It's Ecuadorian, with a cocoa count of [at least] 75%.  CHOCOLAT wants to be this kind of chocolate.  Instead, it ends being more of a blend of Hershey's milk chocolate (to please the American consumers) with the sensibility of a dash of French dark.  In other words, not really smooth or memorable, but it wants to be!

I'll add in just a dash of synopsis, here, to get a sense of the recipe.  For starters, director Lasse Hallstrom (or should I say ""sous chef"") paints the picture of a conservative little French town that Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) swoops into, with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol).  This ultimately poses a great challenge to the Comte (Alfred Molina) and most everyone else.  Why?  Because Vianne has set up a Chocolaterie (chocolate shop) during Lent--an observance that the devoutly Catholic villagers strongly uphold.  This is a time when they abstain from indulgences (especially foods like chocolate!).  This also co-stars Johnny Depp.

Though, CHOCOLAT delivers in terms of visual beauty and spectacle, and the chocolates look divine, the storyline and most of the rest of this film leave a lot to be desired.  Yes, a lot of you will think I am being harsh.  Yet, while I sat there, watching this film (I won't even lie to you--I saw it twice), I couldn't help but feel that CHOCOLAT stole gimmicks from virtually every film genre focusing on mysticism, magical realism or food and claimed them as their own.  The filmmakers desperately wanted to make the story something for everyone.  We have a swashbuckling pirate (Johnny Depp), who is Irish, nonetheless.  We have the mysterious stranger who sails into a town with her daughter, and no one knows her background.  Is she a heretic?  A witch with a cauldron of chocolatey sacreligious goodness--made to saturate and corrupt the palates of the unsuspecting villagers?  We even have a subplot alluding to a battered wife (Lena Olin).  Good lord!  The gimmicks boggle the mind.  Okay, dear readers.  Thank you for sticking with me on this review.  Those of you who were diligent enough to read it, I have a verdict for you.  Skip this film and watch.....I am thinking LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE.

Vianne rents a shop which opens to the town square where she opens an unique Chocolate shop. The only problem is ... it is Lent. The town is mostly Catholic, they are celebrating Lent by abstaining from certain pleasures, one of which is likely chocolate. Depriving oneself or abstaining from something one loves is a custom or tradition during Lent. Vianne is an outsider, she and her daughter are trying to fit in and be accepted. In a small French town which has a long history with many old traditions and customs, this is a difficult endeavor. This delightful film shows how prejudice and stubborn beliefs *toward* *newcomers* can be overcome ... with humor and chocolate. Serious moments arise when vindictiveness and cruelty challenge the main characters spirit and nature, yet in the end understanding and kindness prevail.

The eccentric characters in the film are delightful and funny ... The mayor acts ""holier-than-thou"" except his secretary Caroline knows the truth ... There may be marriage problems between the mayor and his wife. The wife had gone on an extended vacation to Italy, with no definite date to return. Caroline seems an up-tight and very controlling personality  related to her son and her mother who is elderly. Then the viewer discovers, the mother is diabetic and does not monitor her food intake properly which makes her health deteriorate. The mayor learns Vianne is a single mother of which he disapproves. He provides gossip about her to the towns people, influencing them to avoid her shop. However, the mouth-watering treats are a temptation several citizens can not resist. One such person is an elderly gentleman and his dog  as they walk by the shop daily. It is the dog that is drawn to the treats . The elderly man wants to court a widow ... Vianne gives him pointers on how to win over his lady love ...

Some gypsies enter the scene as they arrive in house boats and dock on the Thames. From this point forward, the story gets more complicated ... Vianne gets involved romantically with the leader of the gypsies. Vianne provides a home and shelter to an abused wife of a bar owner. The husband of this wife goes to classes to learn how to improve his behavior, he appears contrite and ""reformed"" but in the end, as they say ""a leopard does not lose his spots"" and he nearly ruins the lives of many people, nearly killing many by an act of cruelty. The conclusion of the film ties together the serious and humorous aspects of the story in a most creative manner. This film is amusing, charming, and delightful. It has a very satisfying ending. The whole film is a great viewing experience. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1166486400,4,2778,4.733471074380165
1301864,3,B00003CXR1,"This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.

Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever.

1301868,3,B00003CXR1,"This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile.

Vianne is kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.

Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever.

The actors all do tremendous work making the magic come alive. I cannot decide who amongst them is my favorite. They seem like real people, struggling to understand life, burdened by it, and yet wanting to find the means to laugh and play like children. The final scene is wonderful.

1301987,5,B00003CXR1,"Chocolat is a wonderful little film that has much to say people, as individuals and as groups. With its exotic yet familiar feel, beguiling music, and focus on truly human characters, the movie stands as an oasis in the middle of the desert we call life. Don't get the idea that this film is boring just because it doesn't feature a lot of ""action,"" as there is a great deal going on in the lives of these characters. They are all at a collective crossroads, only it's not really a crossroads because the only real options are to go forward or backward.

The setting is a quaint French village which stands starkly on tradition; new people with new ideas just aren't welcome there at all. The best way that I can think to describe the social setting is to say that these are French people being French. There's one self-righteous, powerful know-it-all at the top who tells everyone what to do and how to do it, and all of the villagers are too cowardly to rock the boat or think for themselves. Living in the past is a miserable way to live. You've got an elderly woman still mourning her husband's death 42 years after the fact, a younger widow who won't let her son doing anything because she's afraid something will happen to him, a wife who won't leave her abusive husband, etc. Everyone is so worried about what others might think of them that they don't really live. The mayor is so puritanically dominant that he even writes the sermons for the young village priest.

Things start to change when a stranger and her daughter show up (wearing red cloaks, no less) and open a chocolate shop. There's a bewitching quality to Vianne (Juliette Binoche), as she seems to know the right kind of chocolate for each person who enters her shop, and there really is some kind of unquantifiable power in her delicious concoctions. With it, she melts the hardened heart of a grumbling old woman (played magnificently by Judi Dench), puts the romance back into a passionless marriage, and even helps give an abused wife the strength to leave her worthless husband. The mayor and most of the townspeople are not at all happy - and then things get even worse, as a band of ""river rats"" settles on the local riverbanks. The whole town just says no to ""immorality"" and refuses to serve or have anything to do with the ""dangerous"" riff-raff - but Vianne does. She hits it off particularly well with a guitar-playing nomad named Roux (Johnny Depp).

Naturally, all of this internal conflict going on inside everyone eventually comes to a climax - and it is here, in particular, that we see both the good and bad side of humanity. There are some really poignant moments as the film draws near to a conclusion, and in the end you're left with something tangible, a renewed spirit. Maybe it's just for a few moments, but you stop and think about the truly important things in life. That's what makes this beguiling little film so special.",1127865600,7,2921,4.591954022988506

1302040,4,B00003CXR1,"CHOCOLAT surprised many cinematic biggies when it was nominated for five Oscars including Best Picture, and rightfully so.  While it is a handsomely filmed and charming movie, only the manipulations of Miramax honchos forced its way into the Oscar elite.  Lasse Hallstrom infuses the film with luscious cinematography and a strong sense of romantic fantasy.  He also elicits some marvelous performances from his talented cast:  Juliette Binoche as the mysterious chocolatier; Alfred Molina as the self righteous and lonely mayor; Carrie Anne Moss as a charming widow who carries a torch for Molina and a heavy hand in relations with her son and mother (Judi Dench in a cranky but touching performance); Hugh O'Conor as a young impressionable cleric; Lena Olin as the abused wife of cafe owner Peter Stormare.  Johnny Depp has a smaller role as the romantic interest for Binoche, but one figures any actor could have played the role and Depp's rich talents are underused.  The still lovely Leslie Caron brings a touch of class in a small role as a grieving war widow.  Rachel Portman's score is lush and evocative, and while CHOCOLAT is lightweight fare, it's still a testament to Hallstrom and crew for their tight professionalism.",1126396800,,1231,5.064356435643564

""Chocolat"" is a paint-by numbers tale of of a confrontation between a village dominated by humorless, legalistic, pleasure-denying Catholics and the pleasure-seeking, chocolate-making Juliette Binoche who seeks to liberate them. The Catholics are for the most part wooden and sterotypical, though not portrayed as outright evil. It all plays out predictably.

1302046,2,B00003CXR1,"This movie had a lot of potential.  It has a fine cast, wonderful setting, and the beginnings of an intersting story.  However, I can't recommend this movie.  I actually found it irritating.  Here's why:

This movie has an agenda; a message it is trying to promote.  The message is a basic humanist take on life; be tolerant and accepting of other people, sit around and chat over a cup of hot chocolate and leave the larger concerns alone... if you do this you'll be a good person.

That message is not bad.  In fact, it's the underlying theme of a lot of literature.  The problem is that in Chocolat, it's so heavily pushed that it feels like watching a propaganda piece.  Over and over, the film tells you what to think and how to react.  It is as if the film were the very embodiment of its own antagonist, Reynaud... 'There is a right way to think and a wrong way to think.  See how we are showing you the right way?  This is the right way.  The other way is wrong.  Do you see how the other way is wrong?'

In order to promote its agenda the film tears down other points of view.  Indulgence is better than discipline.  Drifters are kinder and more intelligent than parishioners.  The Catholic church is first made to look lost, then laughable, then evil.  All is set aright, however, when the village priest sets aside more traditional views and embraces the main idea of the film.

Conveniently, the priest's new views are delivered in a concise sermon... and acutal sermon, caught on film so that we cannot possibly miss the message of the movie.

The bottom line on this topic is that the film believes its message is more important than its story and it really shows.

I also must admit that I found the characters to be very shallow.  All the main characters are either monotone or two-tone (my term for being initially opposed to the protagonist, then suddently changed to being on the side of the protagonist with no interviening struggle).  The protagonist is uninteresting (no inner conflict).  The Johnny Depp character is even more uninteresting (a drifter who is immediately accepted by and is accepting of the protagonist; he brings nothing to the story, except for being yet another outcast that is a good person and enjoys chocolate).  The only character that is at all interesting is the town Mayor, Reynaud.  But even the fine acting of Alfred Molina cannot save this film.

The film is meant to be somewhat of a whimsical, mystical, fairy tale, so I can accept some lack of character depth or true conflict.  Because of this and for the film's beautiful setting, I'm not reducing it to 1 star, but I can't give it any more than 2.",1120608000,9,2655,4.5517970401691334

The message is a bit extreme, making it appear that there is no actual need for rules, but over all it is a very enjoyable movie. It is easy to look past any flaws it may have and relish the beautiful treat that it is. Although the main character Vianne is made to seem kind and loving despite her mistakes and the church-goers cold and rude, it is still heart-warming to see the way Vianne opens her heart to each individual nomatter who they are, and the way the village is influenced for the better by her kindness. It is a great tale of how we need to treat one another, and shows how life is meant to be savored and seen for the beauty it can have.

But, little by little, the woman worms her way into the hearts of the townspeople and not only wins them all over, she finds romance as well.

Nominated for several academy awards, there are only good things to say about this film.  Jullette Binoche is cast as the chocolate shop woman and I adored her immediately.  Judi Dench is cast as her landlady who goes to the shop for comfort because her own daughter has turned against her.  Alfred Molina is the town leader and he sure is comical.  Johnny Depp is the romantic interest, a ""river rat"" who comes to the town to play music.  And in the end, everyone lives happily ever after.

Even I, who usually prefer films on the dark side, was enchanted.

Don't miss this film.  You'll love it.  Recommended.",1117324800,,1268,4.317796610169491
1302101,4,B00003CXR1,"I agree with other reviewers who believe this film is filled with cliches and is predictable in its progression.  But, in my opinion, that's the whole point!  When we watch a movie like ""Chocolat"",we do so for a bit of escapism and comfort-and comfort is ultimately what the characters in this film find.  Vianne and Anouk find the comfort and familiarity of a permanent home.  The mayor begins to be comfortable with the fact that his wife has left him.  Townspeople become comfortable with their various relationships and the young priest begins to become comfortable in his role as the town's spiritual advisor. We see these changes develop against a backdrop of the ultimate comfort food---chocolate!  I believe that watching ""Chocolat"" leaves one nearly as satisfied as consuming chocolate.",1113350400,,795,5.124031007751938
1302102,2,B00003CXR1,"You may love this movie; a lot of respectable, intelligent people do. But a word of caution is appropriate for those who haven't seen it, but are considering buying the DVD. My advice is to see it once before you decide.

I found a couple of points irritating. One is the misguided representation of clergy. The new priest, just out of seminary, is too weak and scared to deal with the local bigwig in any way other than trembling (and complete) obedience. At the end of the movie, the priest--apparently just now figuring out how to articulate this--has the realization that people matter, life is beautiful, the world has riches worth experiencing, etc. etc. As in so many movies, the role of the priest/minister/pastor is written as someone who somehow, after years of seminary training, presumably some life-changing experiences, and solemn vows before God, has never before had the opportunity to think deeply about life, is too terrified by someone in power to buck the system, and has to learn these most basic truths from a lady who magically descends on the town like Mary Poppins and sets up a chocolate shop.

As an example of the low regard this movie has for your interpretive abilities, an abusive husband says something about his victim not even knowing how to use a skillet. Later in self-defense she will hit him over the head with a skillet. Very well. But since you obviously don't get it, she says, ""Who says I can't use a skillet?"" But since you STILL don't get it, the two conscious adult characters now break into laughter at this witty bon mot (having just survived a terrifying assault). Talk about getting hit over the head.

At one point, Judi Dench's character says to Juliette Binoche's, ""Don't look so damn pleased with yourself."" I had the same reaction to the whole production.

I admit I wasn't even stirred by the elaborate chocolate creations, as one is supposed to be in a ""food movie."" (They didn't have to use slow motion in Big Night or Babette's Feast when people put food into their mouths to show how delectable it was supposed to be.)

The actors in this outstanding cast carry the day, and are a pleasure to watch (Alfred Molina in particular, who, given the role of a two-dimensional conformist, somehow manages to make him grow throughout the film). And the DVD bonus material is good. For some, this movie will be a most welcome, momentary escape. But my advice is to rent or borrow it once before laying down your money.",1113004800,18,2468,4.703703703703703
1302103,5,B00003CXR1,"This was actually the first dvd that I have ever included in my library, and I'm glad to say that it was. Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp are utterly amazing in this film; Carrie-Anne Moss did a fantastic job as well. This is one of those feel-good movies that, after watching it, make you want to open up your own little chocolate store in some rural French or Italian village. The story was genuine and original; the chemistry between the characters Vianne and Roux is fantastic, and might I add that Johnny Depp is mesmerizing? Honestly among my favorite movies of all time!",1112659200,10,578,4.621359223300971
1302104,2,B00003CXR1,"Ho hum, yet another film about how the stuffy among us need to loosen up a bit.  In this case the setting is a small French town with a prudish mayor (a real live Count, no less) whose grip on his people is slowly pried away by the arrival of a mysterious lady in red (one of many, many cliches employed here) who makes chocolate with a little something extra that frees its imbibers from their inhibitions.

Although the filmmakers are sure to show that no one goes too far into sin for any reasonable person, this is apparently not the case for the prideful and repressed mayor, his puppet of a young priest, and their parishioners, but by film's end even the mayor is partaking of her confections and providing a noticeable presence at an apparently pagan ceremony held next door to the church.

It could only be more trite if they'd sing ""Koom-By-Yah.""  Fortunately the film is very pretty to look at and there are a few moments with some dramatic tension, notably involving a big dumb lug who beats his wife and her escape from his clutches but, even in moments when a character (usually the mayor) has a momentous decision to make, the character almost always goes exactly the direction we would expect.  Johnny Depp, second only to Denzel Washington on my list of favorite actors, is completely wasted here; his role has possibilities but the script takes this character absolutely nowhere and could have been played just as well by anyone with a SAG card.

Such a shame.  I absolutely love chocolate, but this drek almost gives it a bad name.",1107734400,8,1550,4.594202898550725
1302105,5,B00003CXR1,"Definitely a wonderful movie, Chocolat, brings to the screen the story of a wandering mother and daughter as they settle in a small rural post-war French village, open up a chocolaterie and begin affecting the small community/society in a most profound way.

As the movie implies there is chocolate and lots of it...

The setting is 1959 France, and it is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how trust, love, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance.

On the negative side, the only setback is the clich clash between ""conservatism"" and ""progressivism"" and how Vianne falls for the wandering gypsy.

Needless to say, Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Alfred Molina's character who as the town's mayor, steals the show!",1103500800,9,950,5.07051282051282

 Cuddle up with a mug of hot chocolate (and a few truffles wouldn't hurt). Enjoy. Alone, or with someone, it's great. And the soundtrack will put you in another world.

1302107,4,B00003CXR1,"This adaptation of Joanne Harris's novel lacks the seductive charm and magic of the original, but it succeeds on its own as a quiet film about a French village rife with personal crises.  When the mysterious Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), dressed in red capes, arrive in town on a day the wind from the North gusts open the church doors, interrupting the sermon on the first day of Lent, something begins to stir.  The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) knows it better than anyone.  Vianne opens a chocolaterie, serving up exotic confections designed to bring out the best in people, and relationships in the grim town shift.  Vianne seems immune to her own magic - until a band of gypsies and their leader Roux (Johnny Depp) set up camp on the edge of town.

Director Lasse Hallstrom excels in his evocation of a small French village in 1959 and the people inhabiting it.  Despite its Swedish director, British author, and international cast, this film feels authentically French.  Its rhythms are mostly gentle, and its focus is on character rather than an intricate plot.  Juliette Binoche turns in a fine performance, even though her smile at times seems too vapid and easy for such a complicated character.  Judi Dench makes a memorable appearance as Vianne's landlady, a crotchety but spirited old woman who is estranged from her uptight daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss) and her grandson.  John Wood and Lena Olin also turn in strong supporting roles.

Art house film addicts will want to see this, but more mainstream viewers may be bored.  Recommended for viewers who enjoy the leisurely unfolding of a quiet drama.",1100131200,46,1651,4.942028985507246
1302118,4,B00003CXR1,"This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor.  The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching.  Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat.  Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud.  With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula.  Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel.  Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter.  Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter.  Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996).  She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.

Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys.  It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout.  However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad.  Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience.  He attempts the complex and the unlikely.  Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience.  There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.

Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine.  Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate.  It was quickly followed by coffee and tea.  Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day.  Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church.  Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.

The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role.  Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!).  She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community.  She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots.  She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about.  So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home.  Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying.  It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability.  Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society.  He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his ""favorite"" chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses.  Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females.  When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.

Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France.  If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie.  As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.",1099612800,25,5206,5.0256410256410255

I think that even though the story is simple, it is made into a movie very thoughtfully. When I watched it again I noticed small details that were overlooked the first time, details that brought life to the movie. I love how the passionate woman brings life to this little french town, it grows from a deeply religious and traditional gray town to one that is bright and alive but does not compromise its previous beliefs. This movie also awakened a great passion for real European hot chocolate, not the mix stuff!

What saves this from happening, however, are the performances turned in by Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina, and Johnny Depp.  You feel Binoche's restless spirit being pulled by the desire to provide a stable existence for her daughter.  You feel Molina's pain with a wife that has left him, but still trying to keep it together with a tough exterior that turns the town against him.  And who better than to epitomize the river gypsy than Johnny Depp?

This movie is visually stunning with alot of work having been done to perfect the scenery so that the viewer is transported into a quaint little French Town. The musical score is upbeat and passionate which adds a special dimension to the film.
Johnny Depp does an excellent job as the gypsy drifter that is greeted with reserve and prejudice by the uptight townspeople. Juliette Binoche plays the single woman with child who blows into town with a wind and leaves it in stiches. She opens a chocolate shop and falls prey to the overly religious mayor of the town because she entices others to sin during lent. I have to say that my favorite character is played by Dame Judy Dench, she is the free spirit of the town refusing in all of her years to be programmed by the rest of the world. She indulges in the delicious chocolate despite being diabetic and scolded by doctors and her own daughter. The chocolate becomes its own character managing to magically cure all of the towns ills if they allow it to work its sweet way into their deepest desires.

1302180,4,B00003CXR1,"Movies like these are usually drugged on their own sweetness and are thus painfully predictable. But I guess I was rather pleased with Chocolat, the execution is fine.
Juliette Binoche sparkles as usual. Johnny Depp's Irish accent is passably credible. Their chemistry is good, specially in a scene where Juliette swims to protect her daughter. Problem is that once Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village (which btw is merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette), everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable.
A wide array of chocolate in all shapes and contours comes to the rescue though, adding a splendid flavor to the screen. But don't bother to ask how such a reclusive, middle-of-nowhere village gets all that cocoa.
The subdued religious angle is a bit moronic, it makes organized religion look like a kindergarten tiff. Just because Binoche's character is ""different"" no one takes easily to her and every kid in town feels comfortable taunting her child at school. What precise religion was this?
The final scene with a whole village prancing about at Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal to the hilt. So is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy it may have been in itself. Come to think, we could probably have done without the gypsy stuff altogether.
Anyway, the film is woth seeing if you know what you're getting into and are expecting pseudo-charming fluff. In the same league perhaps as Notting Hill, French Kiss or Sleepless in Seattle.",1082505600,2,1580,5.057471264367816

People have mentioned several movies that did the same, but better: dare I add to the (long) list, and suggest ""Breaking the Waves"" (a good example of how ""arty chick flicks"" actually can have guts sometimes) or Kubrics ""Clockwork Orange"" (as it shows the consequences of ""Chocolat""s attempt at philosophy)?.

1302187,3,B00003CXR1,"It's interesting to see that there's so much activity for this film since it's been released for quite awhile.  However, perhaps Depp's recent performances have drawn attention to it.  After watching him in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" I realized that he might be one of the best young actors in our time.  I mean he can really act like different people...not just take type-cast rolls.  And so I wanted to see his work here.
What I found was a blatant skewing of a storyline to engage people while communicating a specific message.  While most intelligent books & movies now try to show how multi-dimensional everyone is...how difficult it is to simply cast someone as ""good"" or ""bad""...this movie does the reverse.  As characters are introduced, you are quickly able to assign them to one of 2 camps: good enlighted folks or bad religious uptight folks.  (There's also one bad drunken guy who is taken in by the bad religious folks for their own agenda.)
What unfolds, then, is not a film about the transformation of human nature or the triumph of hero in a realistic set of circumstances.  Rather, you have an ""unlikely"" heroine cast in a role where she's bound to succeed in proving how good she ultimately is.  (She has all good people on her side, of course).  This mysterious woman who works on Sunday & has an illegitmate daughter basically acts as the religious figure of the movie.  She heals the sick, protects the vulnerable, brings together the lonely and even, yes, loves her enemies.  The bad people are eventually either ""converted"" to her side or made to look absolutely ridiculous.  They are degraded and dismissed.
Depp's character makes an interesting entrance towards the end of this movie.  As usual, I think he played his role well.  He plays the intelligent, intriguing, competent gypsy he's supposed to be.  I like his character, but I wished there was more of him.
In the end, I had very mixed feelings about the film.  I felt that the artsy people behind the film (not necessarily the author of the original book) were using this film to express their own internal emotions.  It was like they poured themselves into this heroine and tried to make you understand how good & sincere they are - despite their unconventional lifestyles.
And it is engaging.  I legitimately liked the heroine & hoped she would succeed.  I felt like I had to use all my intellectual power (which is, admittedly, minimal) to pull back from the emotional draw of the movie in order to analyze the realisticness of the plot.  As I said at the beginning, my ultimate feeling is that this is a blatantly skewed plot used to communicate a message.

1302242,4,B00003CXR1,"I found Chacolat to be a very enjoyable movie.  Though some parts of it were a bit boring, most of the movie was good clean fun.  Binoche does a spectacular job in the part of Vinnette, the upbeat chacolater.  Also Olin is praiseworthy for her part as a bruised wife who attempts to turn her life around.
Ok now on to Johny Depp, I'll give it to people that he is a hansome, and fun to watch, but was he really that amazing of an actor?  I'm not saying he's horrible but I certainly wouldn't call him the stand out peformance.
The supporting cast really saved this movie from being boring.  As the major Alfred Molina is great and a very beleivable pious man.
Thivisol is good in the part of Vinettes daughter, she shows the perfect amount of emotion as her child part could.
Judi Dench is exeptional as the old diabetic crazy women, rich with enthusiasim wich is just what the film needed.
Finally Carrie Anne Moss was wonderful as Dench's ""high moralled"" daughter.  She put a lot of energy into the part whuch also helped with the exitment level of the film.

1302244,1,B00003CXR1,"I don't know about life in France 40 years ago, but there are some big misunderstandings in this film. There are at least 3 purposes to Lent. 1) As Mr. Virey points out, Lent is a spiritual workout. If I can say no today to something innocent like chocolate, perhaps tomorrow I can say no to something really evil. 2) Some people abstain from delicious treats everyday. Not because they want to, but because they have no choice. They are called poor people. If I can say no to self-indulgence today, perhaps the money I save can go to help someone who is really suffering. 3) Life & everything in it is a free gift from God. If I can say no today to something good, perhaps I will remember that Providence & that the world does not revolve around me & ""I want"".
  I disliked this movie for several other reasons, most have been mentioned by other reviewers. I will mention one more. 60% of the population of the USA is overweight. Diabetes is almost epidemic.

1302246,2,B00003CXR1,"Any film that combines Juliette Binoche with Johnny Depp seems worth seeing just for the absurdity factor. This one is *such* a Hollywood-esque take on small-town French life. You know you're in trouble when the opening voice-over (in English, as is the entire film) describes the ""tranquillite'"" of the village ... and then feels compelled to translate ""tranquillite'"" into English. And then there's the foolishness of Johnny Depp playing an Irish traveler who plays steel guitar - including a very uptown version of Django's ""Minor Swing"".

 This is another example of an interesting and slightly strange slice of European life made innocuous and comforting for American audiences.

 Nonetheless, I'll confess that the film is fun, predictable fluff. It's probably worth watching on a flight to Europe, if only because your actual experiences there will be *so* much more thought-provoking and rewarding.",1070582400,,906,5.404255319148936
1302247,5,B00003CXR1,"Feast your senses on chocolate, music and the delicious Johnny Depp.
It is foolhardy to watch this movie without chocolate at the ready.  I predict you will last about 45 seconds after the first chocolate appears before you start ripping off the candy bar wrapper.  (May I suggest a pound of See's as a wise pre-movie purchase?)
The music is a great variety, from kick-up-your-heels to the sweet melody you hear in the wind.  I highly recommend the soundtrack for whatever mood you can think of.
Then, of course, there's Johnny Depp, that hotty of hotties, that dashing, debonair pirate-like sweetie.  His character is just as appealing as the man himself; witty, sweet and adorably hot!
The tale of a traveling mother-daughter duo shunned by the straightlaced inhabitants of a mid-20th-century french town unfolds as they seek out the adventurous, and bring out the spirit in them.  Opening a chocolate shop at the beginning of lent separates the daring from the subdued.  The appearance of Johnny Depp and his Gypsy friends on the banks of the local river create even more conflict between the conservative, who regard the ""River Rats"" as imoral, and the radical, who welcome the ""pirates"" as exotic friends.  The escalating conflict and its finale show everyone their true, adventurous nature.  By the end of the movie, you're convinced one smart woman has brought out the beauty in everyone.

1302288,3,B00003CXR1,"The movie starts off in the winter of 1959, at the quiet and tranquil French village, where the inhabitants live there lives as quietly as possible. Until one day, driven by fate and a strange wind, Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her duaghter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) arrive in town. The villagers are rightly very curious about the strangers but when Vianne opens a chocolatier, the town's mayor (Alfred Molina) warns off the people against the 'evil'. But even when giving out warnings and instilling a fear for such temptations, the mayor cannot stop the villagers' attraction to not only the chocolatier but the outwardly friendly and irresistable Vianne. Vianne little by little shows the villagers what it means to not only enjoy life, but live it.
""Chocolate"" has gotten a total of 5 Oscar nominations: Best Picture (David Brown, Kit Golden, Leslie Holleran), Best Actress in a Leading Role (Juliette Binoche), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Judi Dench), Best Music Original Score (Rachel Portman), and Best Writing (Robert Nelson Jacobs).

First off I must say that the acting done by such an all-star cast is superbly done. Notably Juliette Binoche, with her beauty and charming accnet, is vibrant in her role as the woman Vianne who can't help but be different from everyone else. Alfred Molina also handles his character with what seems like the greatest of ease. Sort of the bad guy in the movie, but can't help loving him by the end of the movie. There's Judi Dench as a elderly woman made an outcast by her own daughter (played by Carrie-Ann Moss you won't believe as the same Trinity we know and love!). There's also Lena Olin who acts out her character of a battered wife to perfection, Leslie Caron in a role you can hardly recognize, and the young priest played by Hugh O'Conor (there's one scene where he sings and dances to ""Hound Dog"" which is very cute!). And of course I mustn't forget Johnny Depp as Roux, the Irish gypsy who falls for Vianne. Unfortunately he had a very small role in the film but was an adorable match for Juliette Binoche. Of course he could have worked on his accent a bit since it comes and goes often.
As for the movie itself, the plot is nothing too complicated or too original. In fact, some like me might find many similarities to the Disney movie ""Pollyana"". There's an outcast who ultimately though reaches to each and everyone in the town. There's a kind of 'bad guy' who chooses what kind of sermons will be preached.
The reason for my 3 stars is because I thought that besides the marvelous acting, the movie itself felt a bit slow and nothing remarkable. And most of all, whoever decided to categorize this movie as a romantic/comedy must have not really read the script. The romance is more like a subplot and ""Chocolat"" is more like a drama than a comedy. Sure, there are a few moments where you can chuckle or even laugh a bit. But no a laugh-out loud movie at all.
So in conclustion, ""Chocolat"" is a sweet movie which flows along at an even pace. A film to watch when you have a few hours to spare where you don't have to concentrate that much. Oh, and a bit of trivia. Johnny Depp plays guitar in this movie in three scenes, and also does on one song on the soundtrack.",1059868800,3,3234,4.604852686308492
1302289,5,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"", chocolate in french, is one of the few quality fables filmed in history.  Its sweet tooth theme is perfect with the characters' emotions.  The old town french town was wonderfully crafted.  The fashion designers crafted the costumes perfectly to look 1959.  Lasse Hallstrom directed this movie brilliantly.  The writers give the movie the extra unique touches that most other today's movies need.  They make all the events fit together as one.
Juliette Dimoche was the perfect actress to play Vianne, a chocolate cook whom most of the town calls her ""Satan"" for no reason.  Judi Dench wonderfully portrays a cranky old woman whose fate becomes unexpected.  Both deserved their Oscar nominations.  Johnny Depp proves that he's improved greatly in the past few years in his role as a river drifter who falls in love with Vianne.  Lena Olin plays a battered wife emotionally.

***Important word of caution: One will become very hungry while watching this movie.  A small bowl of chocolate will cure the craving and will give the experience an extra touch.",1059350400,19,1064,5.051724137931035
1302290,5,B00003CXR1,"I love little French villages; I think they're adorable. I also am dangerously addicted to chocolate and in love with Johnny Depp. So you can see why it's no surprise that I loved `Chocolat', although I'm not quite sure why everyone else did...
The Catholic Church is celebrating the season of lent when wandering single mother, Vianne (Juliet Binoche) and her illegitimate daughter move into a small, strictly religious town in France and horrify the town's people by opening a chocolate shop which severely tempts even the strictest Christians out of fasting.
The mayor (flawlessly portrayed by Alfed Molina) doubts that the shop will last; however, Vianne and her chocolate successfully tempt many a church-going resident and the shop remains open with help from Lena Olin's character Josephine, a kleptomaniac with minimal social skills and an abusive husband.
The mayor and Vianne wage war on each other, each convinced the other one's way of thinking is, in short, at the route of all evil. Their battle for influence over the town turns vicious when Vianne befriends a pack of pirate-like ""river rats"" who show up in the village prompting the priest to call Vianne ""Satan's helper"" in a homily Molina's character wrote.
`Chocolat' is built largely on subplots and metaphors, but unlike most similar movies, is somehow pleasantly simple, which you begin to understand is the idea.
The concept is sweet but greatly dependant on good performances by superb actors, which is has thanks to Alfred Molina, Johnny Depp and Judi Dench.
To me, `Chocolat' was like a relaxing ride down a slow-moving river. However, while I was perfectly content to lust after the leading man, wish I lived in France and plan to buy a box of chocolate as soon as the credits started rolling, it surprised me that anyone else agreed.
It seemed to me that `Chocolat' would lack something as far as critics were concerned, and I was confused when it was nominated for five Academy Awards.
As you can see, I loved the film. However, I'm not so sure that it's as good as its reputation makes it sound. In other words: don't get your hopes up, you'll enjoy it more if you just watch.",1058918400,3,2157,4.848238482384824
1302291,2,B00003CXR1,"There are several things this film does right.  The acting and the writing of the dialogue are just fine, as is the pacing.  I don't have the problem that others who have reviewed here have with the pretentious/smug way in which the lead character sets out to fix other people's lives.  Everyone can relate to the idea of a non-conformist feeling alienated.  I have a small issue with the way the film recycles plots of other films without credit (Chocolat = Mary Poppins + Pleasantville + Like Water For Chocolate).  The big problem I have with the film is...The entire concept of the film!
Chocolat is a liberal fantasy film that perpetuates the myth that no one in the world had any fun until the liberals showed up.  Conservatives are depicted as evil or stupid or innocently mislead (because they didn't know better).  It never occurs to anyone having anything to do with the movie that people might want to embrace the Catholic faith as written *because they want to*.  The only morality embraced in the film is, ""If it feels good, do it.""  That is certainly a point of view, while it might be a particularly childish one, but to state that anyone who doesn't agree with that view and live his life by it is a hate-filled, wife-beating, sociopathic arsonist waiting to happen is skipping a few logical steps, to put it mildly.
The blatant anti-Catholicism of the film is astonishing and reaches a pitch that is sickening.  This is one of the only permissible prejudices allowed in today's PC society.  Just try to imagine this movie if it were done any of the following ways:
-- Lead character sets up a chocolate shop in a community of fasting Buddhist monks, and berates them for not giving in to human temptation.
-- Lead character sets up a Peter Luger's steakhouse in a community of vegans.  Mmm, if you don't want this juicy porterhouse, you must be irrationally repressed, aren't you?
-- Lead character sets up a McDonald's and a Starbucks in an African village, and the anti-globalization folks ""write the sermons"" denouncing the temptation and disruption to the villagers' way of life that should be respected and preserved.
None of those movies could ever have been made.  But in this movie, the climax of the film (that is supposed to be joyous to us) is a pagan festival celebrated on Easter Sunday.  It never occurs to the makers of the film that Easter Sunday might be something worth celebrating on its own merits--or that a Catholic is as worthy of respect as anyone else.
The film sets up a strawman--Catholics/conservatives are bad, repressed people waiting to be saved from their own ignorance, and one shouldn't be a bad, repressed person--and then knocks it down.  Hooray for it.  Anyone who is in favor of being bad and repressed should certainly sit up and take notice....

1302345,4,B00003CXR1,"This is a lovely little movie set in a quaint French village, with Juliette Binoche as the chocolatiere who stirs up this highly conformist place. Despite its 20th century setting, the village seems to have been caught in a time warp; evidence a lady in mourning for her husband who died in World War I!! The Mayor, of aristocratic descent, is the de facto seigneur of the village and nothing is too small for his touch. He manages his rented properties as a benevolent landlord, where the commercial rental relationship is almost subordinate to the underlying feudal loyalty. At the root of the village's life, he literally instructs the village priest on the sermon to be preached at Sunday mass. His focus is to keep the village faithful to the traditions of the past, including those of his own aristocratic ancestors. Deserted by his wife, a desertion he cannot comprehend and tries stubbornly to deny, his retreat for comfort into orthodox Christianity is stalled by the entry of Binoche. A non-conformist to the core, Binoche gently but firmly turns the quiet village topsy-turvy, not so much by open confrontation of established village norms, but rather by simply ignoring those norms she considers irrelevant - be they attending the Church or refusing to fudge her single mother status. Chocolate, once known as the food of the gods, here is a metaphor as Binoche uses her tempting concoctions to entice and provoke the villagers into questioning their lives and perhaps changing them for the better. There are no real bad guys here (barring Serge) : for all his prissiness, the Mayor is a decent man adrift in a world he cannot control. Nor is the teaching one-sided: At the end of the movie, Binoche has been changed as much as the villagers. The movie is strewn with cameos but the limelight is easily stolen by Judy Dench as the irascible and ailing Armande and Johnny Depp as the relaxed river rat. Maybe not a great movie, but a good one nonetheless.",1050883200,2,1966,4.8023598820058995

True the film is gorgeously shot, and obvioulsy warmly regarded by those involved in its production, but this film borders on simplistic naivety, coming on like an anaemic, charmless, witless version of 'Amelie' through characterisations (such as the mayor) that are way to broad and crudely sketched and caricatured to be anywhere close to enamouring. Through a few tepid patches in the narrative, the film generates a high 'oh get on with it' quotient. All this is redeemed somewhat by Binoche and especially Olin's performances, their luminance enough to acrry the film through most of its moribund patches.",1050710400,,782,5.1171875

I was really lucky to have chosen an off night to go to the theater so I sat in a vintage theater, all by myself and watched the show.  Perhaps the setting added to the mystique and romance of the movie and allowed me to focus deeply into it.  Juliette Bincohe is excellent as a woman who is used to moving because of the wild effects her work and has to finally confront that she's become so habitual in her wanderlust that it's her and not her mysterious effects that making her move around so.  Judi Dench is also great as an old woman who has to learn to change her ways.  While everyone is affected by the chocolate, it's interesting to see how the opposing sides judge freedom.  This film has a subversive message about pleasure and it's relationship to God.  So many times God is portrayed in Western culture as authoritative, somber and frankly, mean.

1302432,5,B00003CXR1,"Whether as an afternoon teatime snack, quick pick-me-up at work, or Halloween treat, chocolate has become a staple in America.  This movie is about chocolate, but about its use as a healer and its power to ""unlock hidden yearnings and to shape destiny."" Figures, since depression can be alleviated by chocolate.  And the creator of this confection in this extremely palatable movie is a healer herself.
Chocolat tells the story of two people who descend upon a provincial French village in the wake of a sly and strong north wind.  Those two people are Vianne and her young daughter Anouk.  Oh, perhaps I should say two people and an animal.  Anouk has an imaginary friend, Pontouf, who is a kangaroo.  She sets up shop, a potisserie, and opens it during Lent, not exactly perfect timing in a God-fearing village whose inhabitants believe in calm, tranquilitee, to use French.  Basically, knowing one's place, being obedient to authority, and going to church on Sunday are the pillars of this French village.
The idealist and romantic Vianne comes against the extremely conservative mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, as well as most of the people here.  She doesn't wear black, doesn't go to church on Sundays, and (gasp!) is an unwed mother.  She is also the only one who accepts Roux, the handsome leader of raft-bound river rats the town shuns as being immoral.  As a wanderer herself, Vianne naturally finds affinity with the riverfolk.
Before long, things start happening in the village.  People who buy her wares become more loosened in attitude, more courageous, and in the case of one married couple, saves their marriage with a rebirth in their sex life.  She also helps her landlady establish ties with her grandson, who has an affinity for drawing morbid pictures.  Basically, her altruistic spirit helps spread friendliness and helps certain townfolk relax from their hidebound ways.  Vianne gains the enmity of the mayor who sees her as an enemy, and seeks to drive her away by having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.
This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.  (OK, I know it came out in '99 but it came to my local theatre that year.)  I must admit I was torn between her and Julia Roberts as my Best Actress choice for 2000.  I've seen Alfred Molina play a large variety of roles, be it as Kenneth Halliwell (Prick Up Your Ears), Satipo (Raiders Of The Lost Ark), and most recently, as Diego Rivera in Frida.  His portrayal shows he can act as a diametric opposite of Rivera, an uptight, stuffed shirt traditionalist.  Lena Olin gets kudos as Josephine, a misunderstood kleptomaniac in a trapped marriage who follows her own drum.  Naturally, she is one of the first to befriend Vianne.  Judi Dench as Armand the landlady, and Peter Stormare as Josephine's odious and abusive husband also shine out here.
Chocolat also shows two things:  One, we need more people like Vianne to heal us.  Two, we need something to heal us, and no, I don't mean with standards such as religion or money, but something else that fills us within.  This movie's a nice confection that isn't sickly sweet or mere coloured sugar, but something with a rich flavour that will leave one's stomach glowing inside.",1040774400,12,3330,4.81195079086116
1302433,2,B00003CXR1,"I have read through a fair number of reviews, and I see that many people have taken exception to this film's anti-Catholic attitudes and pervasive Liberalism.  Well, nobody will ever accuse me a being a great friend of Roman Catholicism or of being a staunch conservative, but I too found this film to be pretty hard to stomach at times.
What was most annoying for me was how black and white everything was in this film.  The liberated chocolatier versus the stuffed shirt mayor.  Worldly cosmopolitanism versus small-town provincialism.  I expect more from Lasse Hallstrom than a bunch of straw men waiting to be knocked down.
I found the chocolatier to be unbearably smug, as she deftly solves, one after another, the various problems afflicting the townspeople.  You would think that these folks must be dumb as posts, because they seem incapable of solving their own predicaments.  Perhaps it is in fact because these types of problems are so rarely solved with a few simple words and some chocolate goodies.
The treatment of the mayor was particularly hard to take.  Here was a man of obviously deep convictions who took his duties to his town quite seriously, yet he is an object of ridicule throughout the film.  His chocolate-induced collapse at the end of the movie struck me as a false note that could not be possibly be reconciled to the personality we had seen on the screen for the previous two hours.  It seem extremely contrived?  Is it possible that the filmmakers could not successfully resolve this storyline about the conflict between the two main characters?  Left with no resolution to the move, were they forced to cobble together this ridiculous conclusion?  It just seemed too forced and unbelievable.
I don't like movies that pretend to have all of the answers.  However, the cinematography and music was very nice; for that, I give it 2 stars.",1040169600,14,1869,4.858044164037855

Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Johnny Depp all give fantastic performances.  Hugh O'Conor also shines as the Elvis-imitating priest.
This is a great adaptation of the novel by the same name.  This film teaches us to measure our lives by what we indulge ourselves in, as well as what we deprive ourselves of.  There is strength in both virtues, and only one who finds that equilibrium can be truly happy in life.
Chocolat, anyone?",1039910400,2,599,4.95
1302435,4,B00003CXR1,"When this movie came out, I really wanted to see it. The location and actors are beautiful and well-chosen. The acting was high quality as well.
So with so much going for the movie, why was I disheartened by the ending? The charactor of the mayor is stilted. He is a moral man who loves his city, the city's people and feels strongly that he provides leadership through example. Having been left by his wife in a time when divorce was not available, he treads the higher moral ground by not speaking ill of his missing wife, and by not bedding a woman that clearly cares for him, in spite of the fact that he is still coming to terms with the loss.
Toward the end of the movie, the mayor is shown in the chocolate shop, rolling around in the chocolate. This seemed very inconsistent with a charactor who feels so strongly about morality. While some have suggested that this scene reveals the mayor's hypocrisy, I think that the makers of the movie lost their focus at this point. If they were trying to say that morality should not be equated with a joyless life,they did not show this in the chocolate-rolling scene. Frankly, the scene makes the mayor look crazy rather than open to new ideas. The makers of the movie would have done better to show morality being combined with the joys of life, instead of making those with morals into the ""bad guys"". In fact, after the mayor's ""awakening"", he is shown making friends with the woman who cares for him. However, it is appears he plans to just sleep with her rather than the movie's making a point that he is divorcing his wife so that he can move on from his loss,yet maintain his morality. As a result,the movie celebrates his fall from morality as a good thing.
So, the movie celebrates the single mother who is sleeping with a man she just met as a hero, and makes a fool of the man whose strongest desire is to live a moral life in spite of hardship.
As a result, I walked away from this movie feeling cheated of the ""feel good"" ending I expected and was disappointed in ""if it feels good do it"" moral of this story.",1038873600,6,2072,4.384415584415584

Although not an action film, the story was more inviting than first impressions would present. The acting is good, especially by Juliette Binoche (when will she make more American movies?) and Johnny Depp (who appears much less often than I thought he would). The supporting roles are well-acted also. Although the movie is somewhat predictable, it is still enjoyable for its showing how human behavior can change for the better and that it often takes less effort than eating chocolate.

1302437,4,B00003CXR1,"Coming from Lasse Hallstrom, the director of `Cider House Rules', this film is sweet as it's name. It is a simple story set in a French village in the late 1950s. Vianne ( Juliette Binoche ) who migrates from village to village comes here alongwith her daughter Anouk ( Victoriwe Thivisol ) on a cold windy day. She rents a shop from Amande ( Judi Dench ) to open a delightful Chocolaterie. Her little shop introduces the villagers to the pleasures of delectable chocolate and spiced hot cocoa which Vianne prepares and serves personally. She befriends many with her knack of guessing each one's favourite flavour. Little does she know that this town is controlled by the Mayor ( Alfred Molina ) who is an orthodox man and despises all such worldly pleasures. He uses the church sermons to preach the village folk to stay away from such temptations he considers sins and makes no pretence of his dislike towards Vianne. The movie is about how Vianne takes up this challenge fighting her own insecurities and seduces the village with her fine art of making sinfully tempting chocolates. There are several subplots in the film -  one of a battered wife Josephine (Lena Olin ) who stands up for herself , Amande's bitter relation with her daughter and her longing to be with her grandson, the Mayor's own inauthenticity and the bad boy gypsy Roux ( Johnny Depp ) who  plays the love interest of Vianne.
The movie is warm and sensitive. There is a lot of lighthearted humour brought out in various situations. The scenes that show the making of delicious and eye-catching chocolates are delightful. All chocolate lovers will be lip smacking at those very moments. But, movie's strength is in exposing the hypocrisy of those who claim to be close to God but have chosen the path of denial even to such simple a pleasure as enjoying a chocolate. It teaches us to drop all the significance we give to our lives instead of just relishing our moments.
Vianne's character as the charming chocolatier is played to perfection by Juliette Binoche. While, Albert Molina as the repressive Mayor is excellent. Johnny Depp gives the romantic angle to the film. Judi Dench as the old indulgent Amande is graceful.
See this one, it will bring a sweet smile to your face.",1038268800,5,2251,4.7251908396946565
1302438,4,B00003CXR1,"Chocolat (French word for Chocolate - for those not linguistically endowed) is a charming movie which leaves you feeling good about life (no matter how much it sucks in reality!). It is based on a novel of the same name by a not-so-well-known writer Joanne Harris.
Based in a small french town, the movie charts the life of Vianne Rocher and her young daughter Anouck and her imaginary pet kangaroo pantoufle. Vianne and her (apparently) out-of-wedlock daughter move into this town and set up a chocolaterie (a chocolate shop) much to the dismay of the orthodox inhabitants. Vianne is opposed by most of the town dwellers, especially the mayor who considers it blasphemous to even think about chocolate in the traditional month of abstinence for the christians - Lent.
The movie is about how Vianne slowly wins over the townfolk with her 'customised' chocolates and coffee and by caring / listening to others and helping them. The movie stars the extremely attractive Juliette Binoche, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp in a pretty different role. The film is a 'Life is beautiful' kind of movie that leaves you with a lump in the throat and reassured that all is not wrong with this world.",1037318400,,1188,4.828431372549019

The mayor is strongly opposing her presence and business in town. So he tries by all means to find a way that can make the community to hate her too. Since majority of the people are strongly Catholic religious, he influences the priest to preach that Satan will come to them in a form of chocolat. By so doing, driving the customers away. Even though she is been hated by almost all in town, Vivien continues to love everybody the same way.
There is also Josephine`s abusive husband, who takes hide from alcohol. After a series of abuse, Josephine found refuge in Vivien`s house and help her with the chocolat making.
Overall, the chocolat brings everybody together.",1036627200,,795,4.605633802816901

That by any other name would smell as sweet.
So, what is in a name?  A lot I would posit when it comes to this movie.  Take for instance, this movie came out a few years after the hugely successful Alfonso Arau-directed, ""Like Water for Chocolate.""  Hollywood seemed to be in the habit of producing doubles at the time.  ""A Bug's Life"" was successful so someone produced ""Antz"", etcetera, etcetera.  The ""Like Water for Chocolate"" ""Chocolat"" seemed like another such mirror image conundrum, thus my movie-viewing family stayed away from this one.  That is until recently, and I must say, this is a different film and one on top of it that is wholly enjoyable.
It tries a bit too hard to be foreign and although shot in an authentic French provincial village (apparently they actually have these dotted across the countryside of France) comes off as having an American tilt to it.  So, here is the other difficulty in the name.  If you talk about watching this movie to your friends or ask a video rental clerk for it, it's almost impossible to pronounce the name without coming across as an ""I only watch films instead of movies and if the film is foreign it instantly is raised in my esteem"" snobbery.  Try it.  Pronounce ""Chocolat"" to your dog sitting next to you now by your computer.  See, your nose instantly goes in the air, the corners of your mouth are down-turned in a pouty snootery, and the top of your head wiggles every so slightly side to side to indicate...there...I've just said something foreign making me somewhat better than you.  ""Chocolat.""  Take this piece of advice, since the film is slightly Americanized (how can you have Johnny Depp in it and not be?) go ahead and Americanize the title by calling it Chocolate.  If it was good enough for Hershey, by God, it can be good enough for you.  Besides, your dog and friends will respect you more for it.
Back to the movie.  Juliette Binoche is somewhat miscast as a wanderer-drifter magical Chocolatier.  She is just too prim and proper coming off as a French Martha Stewart to be a true wizardress succumbing to the call of the North Wind at a whim and off like a pastry puff to the next town to weave her magic.  Judy Dench is...well Judy Dench, which is to say the lady is brilliant.  I could watch her act all day.  Johnny Depp is fun as a riverboat drifter rat and the interplay between the stodgy townsfolk's small-town politics and the magic these outsiders bring to the French village is one of the most compelling parts of the movies.  Overall, despite the name, I would say it's an enjoyable view.",1036454400,,2613,4.528784648187633

The actors and actresses are cute, the locations lovely, Judy Dench rules the world, the food bits quite tasty to watch and the story moves along nicely.
I think the thing that gets me about it is that it is supposed to be French, but it is so Americanized that I found myself wondering if they filmed it in Disneyland.  Also, the pat, happy ending is very American.

1302495,5,B00003CXR1,"CHOCOLAT is a movie that warms the heart. It has a mystical feeling about it that is generated by the incredible performance of Juliette Binoche (Wuthering Heights, Blue) and the fictional village where her character creates a chocolate shop of magic in a small European town.
It has warmth about the relationship of a strained mother and daughter who spend their time moving from town to town trying to set up shop. A Chocolate shop it was directed by Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News, The Cider House Rules) who masterfully makes you, the audience, a part of this film. From the evil towns would be ""Mayor"" to the towns very own ""Mistress"" - it has something for everyone to talk about.
This film is soft to the touch and has an incredible amount of humor in it. Including the concept that chocolate is an aphrodisiac. They play that to the hilt. Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hallow) plays the love interest who is the stranger from out of town who is also the bad boy. There is a woman in the story cleverly played by Judy Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Elizabeth, the 4 James Bond movies) who is old and doing everything she isn't supposed and teaches the lessons of life, love and enjoying yourself. It comes at a high price for her in the end.
The story is fun energetic and it is photographed extremely well. It was a charm about it that makes you want chocolate but more, importantly, want to enjoy it to its fullest. The DVD extras include a really good commentary and real detailed documentary on making this fictional town seem very real. This is a good film for the whole family.

I knew I'd probably like this movie even before I saw it. Three of its stars: Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and Johnny Depp all have a talent for picking projects that I end up liking. They do not disappoint here. Binoche shines, Dench grouses her way into the viewer's heart, and Depp is his usual personable self.
The unexpected gems (acting-wise) here are: Molina--who steals this film as the uptight Comte; Carrie-Anne Moss--as stunning a beauty as I have seen..who manages to hit just the right mixture of restraint and empathy; and Lena Olin--whose character undergoes one of the most wonderfully hopeful transformations in the movie (she brings it off flawlessly).
I love how this movie gives the lie to empty, external, even religious moralism. The message of ""don't"" and ""no"" has never done anything but twist the soul of humanity. The resolution of this wonderful fable, particularly Pere Henri's final speech presents us with something truly inspiring to think on.
Exclusion always pales before embrace, Love conquers judgment, and a light shines in the darkness.
The DVD special features are outstanding for a single disc. I particularly enjoy the stirring of Chocolate effect while they load.
I give this movie my full recommendation.",1030060800,9,1483,5.032520325203252

The small French village where Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter (Victoire Thivisol) come to live (delivered by the clever north wind) has been ruled by strict and narrow convention for a long time. The local count (Alfred Molino) is the powerful mayor who ""helps"" the priest write sermons critical of actions eschewing denial of the flesh. The town's unhappy people live in fear of their neighbor's censure, their god's wrath, and happiness in any form. ""Right"" action rules. Sunday mass in the town's cathedral is a mixture of furtive unruly behavior and external show.
But Vianne is a force to be reckoned with. The daughter of a French pharmacist who traveled abroad and met and married her mystical mother in Latin America, Vianne understands the magical properties of natural substances properly mixed and administered. Soon Vianne opens a shop where she concocts chocolate confections to minister to any need-physical, mental, emotional, or spiritual. Chocolate--elixir for the gods and one of nature's wonders is her main ingredient, although others such as selected chili peppers play a part.
As if things weren't strained enough by the arrival of Vianne and her tempting sweets, the poor mayor soon encounters a ""gang"" of river rats who descend on his doorstep one fine day. These Irish travelers are led by Roux (Johnny Depp), a pig-tailed, charming young man who is musically gifted. Vianne and Roux soon stir up all sorts of excitement for the town's inhabitants and destroy the straight-jacket ""tranquility"" of the little village.
I waited to see CHOCOLAT until I could buy the DVD, and it was worth the wait. My granddaughters and I have watched CHOCOLAT several times. We love this film with it's fine cast of characters including the wonderful English actors Judi Dench and John Wood, as well as Leslie Caron with whom I fell in love when I was a little girl and she played LILI in the 1950s film.
Judi Dench is well known, and John Wood less so, but he frequently plays character actors and is very recognizable. He and Alfred Molino played parts in LADYHAWKE, where Molino was Cesar the man who hunted wolves, and Wood the wicked bishop. Rounding out the stellar crew is Lasse Hallstrom the director, who proved in MY LIFE AS A DOG and THE SHIPPING NEWS that he can elicit marvelous performances from children. Victorire Thivisol played PONETTE a few years ago and she remains a wonderful young actress.
CHOCOLAT is a magical film that reminds me that life is about living.",1029542400,2,2589,4.926773455377575

It's a delightful tale about the ability to see things differently, even if you have to rub your eyes a little for it to occur. Do not lisent to Jerry Falwell or his band of self-made film critics; this film is hardly a ""sex-driven"" film. It has absolutely NO NUDITY and some of the classiest sexual innuendos ever developed.  The films sexual humor is the same type of humor that you'd see your parents teasing each other about in the kitchen. In other words, it's harmless.

1302501,2,B00003CXR1,"Whilst it promises to be a high-quality feel-good movie, ""Chocolat"" cannot escape the emotional and socio-political stereotypes which have become so common in current film making. Juliette Binoche plays a rather smug, ostracised single mother who arrives in a provincial French village and opens a cuter-than-cute, better-than-perfect chocolate shop. Her arrival is treated with great suspicion by the locals, particularly the church and the mayor but along the way she manages to establish a limited women-only clientelle. The arrival on the scene of Johnny Depp as the love-interest adds further fuel to the rather structured plot.
The predictable and frequently turgid storyline is supported by flat and unspectacular performances, particularly Binoche, and a singular lack of chemistry between any of the characters. The overall characterisations are very polarised; all the men are against our heroine; all the women are for her. In even simpler terms, all the men are essentially evil except for Johnny Depp, whose token good-guy-in-bad-guy's-clothing character is no fault of his own. Depp and Judi Dench do their best with what they have but Depp, in particular, has almost nothing to work with because his character is so shallow.
The underlying philosophical point of this film centering around a chocolate shop seems to be that ancient customs and beliefs were superior to modern ones and that indulgence in chocolate is the key to true happiness and enlightenment. It is very easy to be critical of recent attitudes; indeed it has become fashionable, but it does not mean that the ways of ancient civilizations (particularly superficial ones) were necessarilly superior to ours. In this aspect the film resolves nothing and as a viewer, I would prefer not to be lectured to.
Overall, I found this film very disappointing and there are far better, less indulgent, feel-good films around. One could be excused for thinking that, with its killer cast, it would be much better than it is. It gets two stars for cinematography and loses everything else for cornball cliches and crude stereotypes.",1028851200,8,2103,5.280597014925373

Obviously, the landlord immediately sets out for maintaining desperately the social and moral status quo undermined now by the exotic owner of the chocolate shop.
You cannot better show to what results prejudices and sudden judgements can lead. Wonderful. I would recommend this film to everybody who is interested in the display of various characters and their interactions. All the characters are wonderfully played.

Her direct enemy:  the Count, who runs both the town and the church and is as devout as he is rigid.
The performances in this movie (which is in English, by the way) are uniformly satisfying; the script is good; and nothing negative sticks out about the editing or the direction.

Juliette Binoche portrays a free spirited woman who arrives in a rustic French town and touches the lives of the individuals as well as her new village.  Her interactions with the people are amusing and and meaningful as she tends to give them a bit of her free spirit and set the people free of the chains that have kept them from living their lives fully.

1302628,2,B00003CXR1,"Someone at the office recommended this film as one of the finest she saw so I went there expecting to be enthralled by its beauty.

There was beauty all right. But in the wrong place. The power of filmmaking is that one is able to convey the author's view and beliefs and if crafted right, move the audience to that belief system. Witness the power of the Disney's film ""BAMBI"" to increase the number of people against hunting innocent animals. No question that it influenced me in that I never hunted animals.

The film Chocolat clearly shows the author's bias towards the New Age and Witchcraft in using chocolate. Witchcraft meaning using compounds to trigger sensations and release emotions that normally would not occur. It does show the origin of cacao in the indigenous mesoamerican religion.

In a good filmmaking, conflict is an essential part of crafting a story and the object is how the protagonist resolves that conflict. In Chocolat, the conflict is traditional repressive Catholic Christianity vs the New Age and the freedom it represents. The first thing that the newcomer protagonist Juliette Binoche as Vivianne does is to open the chocolate shop and have it be open on Sunday in a very Catholic 1950's French village. That is NOT respecting the local customs and practices and of course that starts a conflict.

The list of antagonists reads like everyone that a liberal card carrying ACLU member love to hate...a conservative priest, a conservative religious mayor, a white conservative population, a husband who expects his wife to stay at home...and of course he beats her also.

Of course, the conservative priest and the mayor are shown in the film as hypocrites and the freedom loving chocolat artisan Juliette and the gypsies such as Johnny Depp represent the finest humanity has to offer.

It was this obvious politically correct scriptwriting that lost my respect for the film. The positive for this film was that I thought the acting was excellent and the location and set exquisite.

I do recommend another film that dealt with religious repression and yet it was still respectful of that religion. Babette's Feast to me is a prime example of that film, able to resolve that conflict of releasing the human artistry and feelings amidst a desolate and seemingly repressed faith that allowed no sensual enjoyment for the sake of the religious faith. But yet, there was the respect for that sect by several people who forsook the repressive lifestyle and went on to enjoy the best the world had to offer : fame, fortune, power, the best food in the world ... and after doing all that, realized like the wise King Solomon of Israel and declare, All is vanity, all is vanity !! The French opera singer wrote in a letter that now he is older, he is not longer famous and everyone forgot him. He said maybe that the sisters who stayed in that village and that religious life may have chosen a better path.

I highly recommend Babette's Feast over Chocolat any day.",1023494400,8,2987,4.8203125
1302629,1,B00003CXR1,"What a boring, obvious movie!  Yes, sensuality is good, repression is bad, free spirits are better than uptight clergymen, and the marginalized are always right.

1302630,4,B00003CXR1,"Even back in the 1950's, in this quaint old-fashioned French town, they considered chocolate as an 'indulgence'. No, they were not concerned with the possible weight gain or health problems brought about by eating excessive amounts of chocolate.  They deemed this treat as a temptation, & since it brings too much pleasure to the eater, they (particularly the town's mayor) considered it grave & sinful.
As a viewer, I would deem the 'chocolat' as something intoxicating & liberating.  It represents anything that would bring pleasure to the human senses.  True, it unleashed passion & sensuality among couples.  But it also signified something deeper than skin-deep gratification.  It also represented anything that would liberate the town folks from their fears, insecurities, loneliness & prejudices --- whether it be directly or indirectly.
Like chocolate, culture & religion come in different forms...some are common & widely accepted while others are a bit different & stand out like a sore thumb.  But, also like chocolate, uniqueness adds to its beauty.
So the next time you find yourself staring at a box of chocolate, do not judge its beauty simply by its shape or packaging.  Why don't you cut out on your prejudices, broaden your horizons, widen your options & enjoy the experience of a mouth-watering treat.

As with the main character's creations, Chocolat is rich from start to finish.  The cinematography is marvelous.  The acting is solid and engaging.  And the flow of the story is nearly flawless.
At the core of the message of the film is that life is something to be richly savoured and that faithfulness has more to do with love than with slavish adherence to drab piety.  Chocolat does not refute the basic beliefs of the people of the French town that is the film's setting.  Rather, it blows apart their own misunderstanding of how to live those beliefs.  Moreover, the story opens up the door to the mystery and ambiguity of life lived not by rigid prescriptions and proscriptions -- but by the fierce embrace of life and love itself.  When new life comes to this French town, it comes as a wild flower...and it is anybody's guess as to how it will cover the landscape.
At times, the critique of religion is a bit naive.  This is probably its 'worst' flaw.  But it can hardly be counted as a big flaw in the film.

It captures an feeling of surprise and wonderous sensations. Almost everyone loves chocolate (either dark, milk, white or semi-sweet) and this movie concentrates on that particular love. However it also has a interesting plot.
A single mom blows into a very religious small French town during the season of lent. <And as every Catholic knows, you must fast or abstain from an item you are used to having or doing.> What rocks the church is that she opens a ""sweet shop"".
The movie is sweeping with passion, romance, food and innocence.
Juliette Binoche is ""a classic work of art"" that melted my heart. She is sinously beautiful and yet retains a silent lifestyle. She is not your typical Hollywood starlet, nor should she ever consider herself that. There are not many beauties in Hollywood that are real and a natural woman. Juliette has a beauty that is plain in nature and yet could melt the sun.
This is one of the best DVD's I own. It has everything a film lover could want. The making of the movie; the deleted scenes; commentary by the director and the actors. It even has a special area dedicated to the costumes. It also has the trailer and teasers.
The DVD is great but the movie far surpasses any dramatic movie in recent history. It is a story about giving in to your wildest fantasies and yet staying grounded.

Only the arrival of Juliette Binoche who opens a chocolate shop can change the town.  Binoche is one of those actresses that seems to radiate an inner beauty in films.  Just watching her is a pleasant experience since she seems so lovely (and not just on a physical level).  At times the plot did seem somewhat predictable, but I fell in love with this movie anyway.  The setting was lovely and I thought that many of the actors were just perfect for their roles, particularly the child actors.  I will admit that the accents were sort of strange, you had real French actors with believable accents interacting with British and American random accents, plus Johnny Depp's Irish accent was a bit off target.  And the voice-overs were heavy-handed, seemingly to explain things in the movie that you'd have to be sleeping through the movie to not have understood.

I didn't know a THING about this movie when I agreed to see it with Sis in Law, but I think she choose very well for us. Juliette Binoche is quite charming as the chocolatiere who's getting everyone worked up but managing to subdue them all with just the right kind of truffle or cocoa. Oh, if life were only so simple in actuality! I especially loved the colors of her clothes in this movie, lovely aquas and salmons. ""Chocolat"" is a feast for the eye as well as the mouth (although the mouth part is vicarious, really). Dame Judi is a bit more crotchetty here than usual, but still a great performer. Depp is sexy as a gypsy guy who manages to be slightly a step ahead of Binoche, disconcerting her as the only one who's favorite chocolate she can't quite detect.
I think it's interesting how many other reviewers are angry that Johnny Depp didn't have a larger role than his billing would have you believe, but I think the true qualifier for that dubious honor would be Leslie Caron.

Given his high visibility on the movie poster one would think he is a playing a major character in the film! Truth be told, we only see him and his guitar for about fifteen minutes. After a romp with Binoche's character, Depp's usefulness as a morality plot point against the backdrop of a staunchly Catholic French town is complete, and he strummingly floats down the river with his (Irish?) gypsies (and, I suppose, hops back on shore to collect his check from Mirimax and sprint away from this stinker of a movie).
I like films which use food as a healing device (which always revolves around ethnic minorities or, in this case, the oddball in an orthdox society) but I just can't buy this ""healing chocolate"" clap-trap. Binoche's character is part medicine man, part mystic and fully unbelievable. Watch as every person comes into her chocolate shop complaining of whatever ailment there is under the sun.

CHOCOLAT (2000) is, however, a well-filmed and well-acted story of a young Gypsy-ish French woman named Vianne (wonderfully played by the wonderful Juliette Binoche) and her ten-year-old-ish daughter who breeze (literally) into this small, old-fashioned--and traditionally Catholic--French town and proceed to cause a major stir in the values--and the loins--of many, by opening up a decadent--and mysterious--Chocolatier right in the middle of the solemn period of Lent.  This will not do, according to the town mayor (played by veteran British actor Alfred Molina), and an over-protective mother (believably played by Carrie-Ann Moss of THE MATRIX) who scorns her own mother (played by the always-wonderful Dame Judi Dench), whom she considers an infidel--so much so that she won't let her mother anywhere near her own grandson.
So, things basically progress from here [SPOILER ALERT]: Vianne quickly becomes known for her ability to prescribe the 'right' kind of chocolate for each customer as a cure for his/her societal 'ills'. Eventually she comes to 'cure' the entire town, whilst finding true love for herself in the form of Johnny Depp, as an Irish ""river rat."" The End. :)
Juliette Binoche is glowing throughout, and was deservedly nominated for Best Actress. She makes you believe in her character as someone who possesses special powers to discern what is lurking deeply in people's hearts (I know, that kind of sounded like THE SHADOW, didn't it?). Judi Dench is virtually unrecognizable in her role of an old free-spirit who's lived most of her life in the town as a shunned figure; she was deservedly nominated for Best Supporting Actress.
However, the film is ponderously directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who directed the similarly slow, but superior, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999). This style itself wouldn't have been much of a problem here if the ending weren't so obvious from about the halfway point. As a result, it does become a bit boring.  The two best things about CHOCOLAT are: 1) The subtle acting performances from Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, and even hulking Peter Stormare (remember him as the strong, silent kidnapper in FARGO?); and 2) The delicious scenes of chocolate-making, which made me really wishing I had some of those wonderful confections.
Bottom line: Decent film, a bit too long, very well-acted, will make you crave chocolate--bad!!! MODERATELY RECOMMENDED",1016236800,6,2554,5.196601941747573
1302778,3,B00003CXR1,"CHOCOLAT lacks action and heavy drama. Also, outside of Judi Densch's best-supporting nominated performance, the acting isn't all that great. Johnny Depp shows up at the end of the film, but his appearance is more of a cameo than a performance.

The movie itself isn't bad. The story has a good moral (tolerance) and the setting of a small 1950s French village is beautiful. However, the film isn't all that great; it's just average. The film's story is just another rehashed version of a water-downed Hollywood favorite: an outsider with liberal values moves to a small secluded place, the outsider is threatened, but in the end the outsider ""enlightens"" the people about their backward ways.

Tolerance and forgiveness are essential in life. Jesus was all about forgiveness and Christians should be the most forgiving people. There are some Christians who aren't very tolerant or forgiving, but many are. Therefore, why are Christians almost always the bad guys in modern movies?

I think it works on its intended level, which is that of a sweet, delicious confection. And it's cast includes Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin and Judy Dench, four actors who can do no wrong in my book.
The time appears to be the 1950s, and the place is one of those quaint French villages you see on postcards and in posters. The town's mayor, Comte de Reynard [Alfred Molina], is from a family of pious and benevolent aristocrats who have ruled over the town for centuries. Life is quiet and orderly, and the center of activity and social life is the local Catholic church, where the young priest allows the mayor to edit his sermons for him. Everyone seems to believe that contentment equals happiness, but the truth is that the utter predictability of life there has led to utter dullness. One day a fierce north wind begins to blow and almost literally brings to the town Vianne [Binoche] and her young daughter. Vianne rents a dingy old shop from a bitter old woman called Armande [Dench]. She transforms it into an enchanted place full of the fabulous chocolates she makes. She doesn't attend church and has the nerve to open her shop in the midst of Lent, a time when all good Catholics deny themselves pleasure. The mayor is incensed and does all he can to close the place down, but, one by one, the residents discover that the chocolates are more than just delicious. They have magic powers to change lives for the better. This, of course, makes the mayor even angrier. Things get even worse [or better, depending on your point of view] when a group of river gypsies, led by Roux [Depp], land in town.
The beautiful Binoche, who is French, is the perfect choice for Vianne. The worldly Dench and Olin fit right in. And what about Depp, who has done rather well for a high school dropout from Paducah, Kentucky? It may surprise you to know that he has lived in France for several years, and, so, if he seems right at home, it's because he is. Oddly, though, he uses an Irish accent here.
The photography is excellent and uses deep, rich colors that are most appropriate for the story and the setting. Director Lasse Hallstrom's other recent films, The Cider House Rules and My Dog Skip, are among my favorites. His forte is movies in which characters and their stories are the dominant features.
I say this is a movie for adults because the subtleties of its story will be lost on most children. As good as it is, it is not my favorite film about the magical powers of food and cooking.

This unassuming and delightful film is a lovingly layered morality tale that unfolds in unexpected ways, never preachy, always entertaining. Few viewers will walk away from this film without feeling at least a little bit better about their lives. A repressionist mindset that seeks little more in life than a numbing stability and a daring gypsy soul embodied in Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who breezes into town and would deny such predictability are co-mingled in a charming French village in the late 1950's. Vianne prepares for her epic contest with conventionality with an irresistable weapon of choice. She opens up a chocolate shop.  As Vianne offers a sympathetic ear along with her magical confections, the suspicious villagers one by one begin to shake off a lethargy that has stifled their mundane lives. Of course the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is understandably unnerved by this threat to good public order. He is a decent man with honorable intentions but holds to an unrealistic standard of perfection no one could possibly live up to. The battle of wills comes to a head with the unwelcomed arrival of the river people led by Roux (Johnny Depp). An instant attraction that arcs between the nomadic spirit shared of Vianne and Roux complicates things in unexpected ways, and Vianne discovers that she too, is possessed of feelings of vulnerability that are to be dealt with or denied. All of the actors in this beautifully photographed story deliver a polished performance. Judi Dench as always, is terrific. Johnny Depp's work in this film has once again demonstrated a remarkable talent and in my opinion is under-appreciated as one of our finest young actors.  This is a wonderfully crafted film, given to voice-over narrative that at times, give it a story book feel.  Highly recommended.",1015027200,2,2093,4.974285714285714
1302833,5,B00003CXR1,"A wonderful movie!  The acting, filming, scenery, and music are first class all the way.
I must disgree with prior reviewers who see it as a duel between temptation and morality. It would be closer to say it's a duel between living life and repressing the urge to do so.  Neither chocolate nor sex are in any way inherently immoral, and while marriage CAN (and should) be sacred, the contrast between the never-married Vianne and the united-in-the-eyes-of-God Josephine and her husband says more about what's really sacred than any religious doctrine ever could.
It was clear to me that Vianne and Roux are two of the MOST MORAL people in the film!  They are loving and nurturing souls, full of life and willing to share (esp. Vianne) what they have with anyone and everyone.  Towards the end, when Vianne finds the mayor in a rather compromised position that is in fact invasive and (at least materially) costful to herself, her response is a generous smile and an assurance that she won't tell a soul.  This to a man who has from the start intended to drive her out of town, and has demeaned her reputation, even going so far as to forbid interaction with her and have her represented as an agent of Satan in the church sermons!
Who is moral here, and who is not? The mayor is 'god-fearing' and well intentioned (in his own mind at any rate), and obviously a kind man, but he can only extend his goodness to a very limited subset of similar people.  Vianne on the other hand offers her gifts generously to everyone (well, maybe not Josephine's husband!) even if they intend her no good. Aside from the unfortunate way she drags her unwilling daughter from place to place I can't think of a single example of non-generous behavior.
The acting is marvelous!  The transformation on Judi Dench's face as she sips that first cup of chocolate is absolutely magical.  The emotional growth of the boy, of Lena Olin's character, even of the mayor... all wonderful.  The supporting cast was uniformly excellent, Leslie Caron, John Wood, Hugh O'Conor and many more too numerous to mention.  Alfred Molina carries a difficult role very well, and Johnny Depp too was excellent.  I was very impressed by both his taste in music and his ability to perform it himself.  Django Reinhardt and Robert Johnson, two of my all time favorites!
And if you'r a chocaholic like me watch out!! You can almost taste it.  Bravo!!!!!",1014681600,8,2405,4.697619047619048

How wonderful to find a good movie that can be watched by the entire family. I was able to watch this with my 87-year-old mother and not continually wince at the language and be embarrassed. The performances are excellent and the plot is intriguing. There is a commercial that states ""Ah, the power of cheese!"" Chocolate seems to have that same power in this film. Or rather, chocolat to use the French. ""Try it; you'll like it.""",1014163200,2,548,4.545454545454546
1302835,5,B00003CXR1,"This movie is so well made, it is sometimes difficult to remember it was filmed in 2001 and not 1959. It's a mouth-watering experience. Being that I own this movie now, and have seen it 3 or 4 times, I always order chocolate-drizzled brownies from a local restaurant while we watch it. Beware, you don't want to see this one without something sweet.
 Vianne(Binoche) and her daughter Anouke, travel with the North winds. On this new journey(in 1959), they land in a small town outside France that seems to be stuck in a time warp.
 ""Tranquility"" , says the town mayer, is the ""motto"" of his small province. Vianne and her Chocolaterie, bright red shoes, sexy clothes, and illegitimate daughter are exactly what the mayor does not welcome into his quiet little town. Epecially, during Lent.
 Vianne still manages to stir up love and lust with her ancient chocolate formulas under the watchful eye of the Mayor. ""One bite and you are hooked"". Her time in the little moral town is interupted with wonderful characters and new friends. I loved Johnny Depp as the gypsy who lands his riverboat alongside the little town, only to cause distubances amongst the chuch-going frenzy of people. He and Juliet Binoche light up the screen and make a sexy match.
 The movie, although a dramatic one, has some outrageous funny moments as well.  Dame Judi Dench, one of my favorite actresses, plays the landlord of Vianne's Chocolaterie. Every word out of her mouth is sarcastic and somewhat ""dirty""(very reminiscent of her small coveted role in Branagh's ""Henry V""). I enjoyed her truthfulness and laughed along with her lines.

Perhaps such an old-fashioned, sweet tale of acceptance and roots is easily trampled under the boots of Roman gladiators. But if you want to know which movie I ran out to buy as soon as it was available, it's this one. I have watched it many times over and never tire of it. It is the details that matter here; the incredibly beautiful cinematography and haunting score, the sets that echo the chocolate theme everywhere you look (check out Alfred Molina's office--the paint on the walls is mahogany so rich you could eat it). The acting by the principles is fine-Depp and Binoche have great chemistry-but it's the secondary characters that stand out; the heartbreaking daughter with her imaginary kangaroo that is the only stable thing in her life, the luminous Lena Olin (who in my opinion should have been nominated for best supporting actress and perhaps even given the lead) who practically steals the show from Juliette Binoche, and the always regal Judi Denche. Alfred Molina gives a multilayered performance; for a person with such broad features that would so easily lend themselves to caricature, his sublety and range is brilliant; he draws a complete portrait of a person who has let his loneliness turn to bitterness and fanaticism. It is his grand dive into what he would have previously thought of as decadence but is actually an admittance of vulnerability that gives this movie its greatest poignance.",1011571200,8,1505,4.8828125

This film's sub-stories of spouse abuse, mother-daughter relationships, and learning to really live life make this film the masterpiece that it is. Did I mention the yummy chocolates?? I had a major craving for chocolate myself after seeing this one.

1302842,5,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"" proved to be my favourite film of 2000. Based closely upon the novel by Joanne Harris, ""Chocolat"" is much like a fairy tale. It possesses the same sense of magic and whimsy, and the added bonus of beaucoup de.... scrumptious chocolate in every shape and form: moulded nudes, suns, Aztec temples, nipples of Venus, thick hot chocolate with cream.... all of these delicacies, when paired with Vianne's (Juliette Binoche) kindess and knack for guessing favourite chocolates, change the townspeople profoundly.
""Chocolat"" is a simple, delicious tale of the human heart, of the value of laughter, compassion, and chocolate of course. The DVD does have a making-of featurette and a few deleted scenes, one of which should have been left in the film (Armande's letter to Vianne) as it clarified and added a great deal of meaning. The feature on the film's costumes was also interesting. If you are a fan of romantic comedy/drama, period films (post WWII rural France), or chocolate, this is a wonderful little film in the tradition of ""Como agua para chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate)"" that blends romance and magic with culinary delights.",1010880000,3,1146,5.101063829787234
1302922,4,B00003CXR1,"Director Lasse Hallstrom has become Miramax's Golden Boy of the moment: his 1999 picture, ""Cider House Rules"" won 2 Academy Awards, and his 2000 ""Chocolat"" grabbed a handful of nominations as well. It's a simple fable about a nomad (Juliette Binoche) who settles in an ultraconservative French town and opens up a chocotat store--smack dab in the middle of Lent. The town's Mayor, pastor, and many of its residents are none too pleased with this lady, who doesn't share their Catholic beliefs. The film goes on to stress the importance of tolerance, but the movie is so handsomely produced that you forget how simplistic this story really is. Nevertheless, it's a well-assembled DVD package with decent picture and sound as well as a nice featurette that includes the cast and crew members. ""Chocolat"" didn't quite deserve to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but it's a decent fable that will pass 2 hours of your time nicely.

CHOCOLAT is a lovely example of this, moving from the ""Once upon a time"" opening to entrancing and seductively charming the viewer into caring for all the characters, even the difficult ones. Each character is, in my opinion, beautifully and caringly cast, and each turns in lovely, nuanced performances. Notable are Lena Olin, Alfred Molina and, of course, Judi Dench. Both Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp are marvellous as well; Depp's character Roux has depth as well as surface charm. The location in southern France is gorgeous; makes you want to live there, too. Have some chocolate nearby as you watch! The cooking scenes will make you crave it!

1302929,2,B00003CXR1,"I would not have rented *Chocolat* and would not have bothered to review it if it had not become such a sensation in Objectivist circles, after philosopher Leonard Peikoff declared : This is the best movie I've seen in decades.
As a former Objectivist who still sticks to a great deal of Rand's esthetic theory (if not much else), I was very curious to see this film, all the more so as Objectivist praise for movies is extremely rare and therefore tends to be quite reliable (I rather enjoyed early recommendations for instance, such as *Dangerous Beauty* and *October Sky*). Such enthusiastic praise from the highest Obejctivist authority - and a man who sells an 18-hour course on how to appreciate great drama- could only mean one thing : that *Chocolate* might reconcile me with an artform that gives me fewer and fewer memorable moments as years go by.
However, I found very little to praise in this manipulative little film, which did not seem to me to have anything great even by Objectivist standards. For one thing, like many books adapted from novels, it makes extensive use of voice-over, something which Rand specifically condemned as the very negation of drama in film (for an illustration of this, I recommend Scorcese's *Wise Guys*, whose inept script is so drowned in voice-over that one feels the movie never even starts.)
Of course, from an Objectivist point of view, *Chocolat* is good in that it has a theme (the opposition of catholicism and paganism) and is wholly integrated around it, down to its facile colour symbolism. But I suspect that what drew Peikoff's praise was not so much the dramatic skill evinced in the writing as the anti-catholic propaganda that infuses the whole film.
To believe *Chocolat*, Catholicism is a religion led by an autocratic buffoon, whose ministers are well-meaning but deluded simpletons, and the believers in which are a host of miserable souls to whom the pleasures of the flesh are sadistically and morbidly denied in the name of a non-existent future life.
The film dramatizes the conflict between this religion and its secular foe by showing us a small French village of the 1950s which seems to have been drained of all its colour by a stifling, frigid religious authoritarianism. Into this lost village come two red riding hoods, red as the devil, a mother and child, who choose to open a chocolate store right at the beginning of Lent, a season where Catholics undergo voluntary deprivation in order to learn to strengthen their resistance to temptation.
Now the chocolates sold in this shop are no ordinary chocolates. Based on some forgotten, occult meso-American knowledge, they seem to combine all the effects of modern drugs, from Prozac to Viagra, bringing back life (i.e. mostly lust) to the mortified inhabitants of the village.
Confronted to this wonder-working technology, the Church- a mere puppet of the state- is simply powerless, as evinced in the gluttonous explosion of the repressed mayor and the parish priest's futile attempts to reform an alcoholic, moronic wife-beater with the rote-learning of catechism and the empty ritual of confession.
Of course the devil wins, the pleasures of the flesh (including extra-marital sex) are recognized as innocent, and the evil Catholic mayor redeems himself by joining the crusade of modern political correctness : the fight against exclusion.
I will not deny *Chocolat* has a certain charm, but I think this is precisely part of its evil. I found it an insidious, snide attack on religion, via caricature and the use of strawmen, suggesting ultimately that the very effort to control one's impulses is the very source of debauchery and violence, and that he who lets himself be gently led into temptation will find his own balance and moderation- a popularized Freudianism that is belied by the modern pandemic of obesity and increasingly depraved pornography, to mention only two examples.
As for the movie's depiction of life in a French village, as a Frenchman who has spent most of his holidays in one of them, I can say that it is almost as laughable as any attempt by Americans to capture things French. The nickname of the old-age pension itself, le Mortoir  is not even good French : we would say le Mouroir , and this is precisely how the French subtitles translated the term.
I gave the movie two stars however, as I would reserve the lowest rating (one star) to films I could not finish (like for instance *Jefferson in Paris* or *The Gospel According to St Matthew*) and I think any film that has Carrie-Ann Moss in it deserves at least two stars (even that Mars movie, for no other reason.)",1007251200,22,4630,4.905612244897959
1302930,5,B00003CXR1,"Yummy-boy did I enjoy this flick. If I had but one complaint it would be that it was not spoken in its native tongue. I found it rather odd that it was situated in a small French villa and everyone spoke perfect English. Aside from that it was splendid! Juliette Binoche was wonderful with her majestical chocolate. Now, being a hugh chocolate lover myself I could have easily been cast under the fantastick spell of the treats she cooked up. More important is the message that this heart warming film revealed-that love should have no boundaries or labels and that each should be accepted as is. The towns people came to realize what Judy Dench knew all along-and that is to enjoy life to the fullest. Johhny Depp is yummy as well and very hard to resist. I am thrilled that he came back to fix the squeak in the door (wink wink).",1006732800,,831,4.437908496732026
1302931,3,B00003CXR1,"This movie is essentially the same story as George Pal's ""The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"" i.e., mysterious stranger comes to town, offers downtrodden residents insight into whatever ideals Hollywood is pushing this year, is opposed by the forces of conservatism, yadda yadda.  The main difference is this movie is not portrayed as a fantasy, and we are expected to regard the heroine's role as the chocolate fairy hawking her medicinal goodies with absolute seriousness.  If you can do this (and some will do it more easily than others) you then have to look past the cliched, cardboard characters; the ultra-conservative religious civil leader, the degenerate wife beater, the crotchety old dowager with a secret heart of gold.  Once that is done you must look past the blatantly predictable storyline, plot ""twists"" you can see a mile off and ""symbolism"" that hits you with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  If you like Johnny Depp (which I do), be prepared to see his talents wasted as his understated character serves two purposes 1) to serve as a downtrodden misfit whom the heroine can befriend and prove how politically correct (i.e., ""good"") she is and 2) to provide a sex scene, which all modern movies must have, because ""how can there be love without great sex"" asks the modern scriptwriter.
After doing all this I concluded that ""Chocolat"" was an entertaining date movie, but not in any way great art, or even a great film.  See it sometime when you're not feeling too critical and you will be fine.  or better yet, watch ""The 7 Faces of Dr. Lao.""  The original is still the best.",1006387200,5,1588,4.794871794871795
1303698,5,B00003CXR1,"For me, much of the pleasure in this film lies in the way in which it taps into so many of the classic stories with which many of us have grown up. There is so much here that comes from other tales, myths, movies, etc. There is the ""clever North Wind"" bringing Vianne and Anouk to the village (not unlike the wind upon which Mary Poppins flew in and out via her umbrella). There is also the ""suspicious"" influences of Vianne and Anouk in the village which are akin not only to those of Mary Poppins in the Banks' household, but also of Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon when they entered Pleasantville.
Of course, and as other reviewers have pointed out, another wonderful feature of this film is its amazing sensory appeal. The appeal is not, however, limited to taste, as one might expect of a film entitled *Chocolat*. It's rich in visual appeal--sunlight, firelight, candlelight, clouds, shadows; tactile appeal--snow, water, fire; and auditory appeal--with a beautifully haunting soundtrack and some very fun songs played by Johnny Depp as Roux and his fellow river rats.
The only real problem I had with the movie really concerned the Comte de Reynaud. He seemed, unlike the other characters who managed to combine comedy with deeper thoughts and emotions, to be an entirely comic character. I personally believe that this is due to shallow character development. I wanted to know more about his personal life--what, in more detail, he was hiding from the townspeople that made him so pompous; what he thought about that made him so adamant about resisting temtation. He just didn't seem. . . tortured enough. Although he had certain traits that were familiar, his was a character that I have not encountered before and therefore needed more information in order to relate to him better.
Despite my problem with the Comte de Reynaud, I think this is a wonderful film--perhaps even one of my all-time favorites--and therefore deserving of no fewer stars than five. The time of the film's setting--during Lent--is perfect for that which the film accentuates. Comedy, drama, mysticism, magic--it depicts so much in life which is there for us to enjoy.

1303700,5,B00003CXR1,"Joanne Harris, the writer of the novel, Chocolat, is apparently a confectionery genius, for this story leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth.  Although I have not read the novel, the movie is delightfully rich and creamy.
Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is a ""chocolatier extraordinaire,"" having the best chocolate in all of France and possibly the entire world.  She and daughter, Anouk, set up shop in a small French village rife with religious zealots led by the mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who is intent on keeping the town chocolate-less.  It is the timeless game of religious piety versus sincere brotherly love as portrayed in the lead characters.
Vianne seeks to sweeten the lives of the villagers in town with her secret panacea, especially the religious rejects like Armande Voizin (Judi Dench).  She is a crusty old woman, the antipathy of her daughter, forbidden to see her own grandson living in town.  Moreover, there is an abused wife (Lena Olin), who finds refuge from her husband, not in the church, but in the chocolate shop.  And finally, if this is not enough to drive a group of religious fundamentalists insane, there is Roux (Johnny Depp), a member of the River Rats, a nomadic tribe of gypsies, who develops an interest in Vianne.  What will become of this little village?  Will chocolate win out in the end, or will the town remain a traditional vanilla?
Binoche is sweeter than chocolate in the lead role, and equally impressive is Molina in his role as the mayor.  Judi Dench and Lena Olin put in outstanding performances in their supporting roles as well.
This is a movie with substance, dealing with societal issues; and furthermore, showing the power of human kindness and tolerance for those with differing lifestyles.  This one melts in your mouth, not in your hand.",1004745600,36,1806,4.911184210526316
1303701,5,B00003CXR1,"I always like movies with a philosophical message that are also good drama and ""Chocolat"" falls into that category.
  Juliet Binoche moves into a very religious, self denying French town and sets up a Chocolate shop.  She has a knack for knowing that special chocolate treat that will make a person's mouth water and bring a smile to their face.  And she is committed to helping people in this town to enjoy themselves more.  Johnny Depp plays her bad boy love interest.
  I had to rent this movie when I found out that Leonard Peikoff, the prominent Objectivist (Ayn Rand) philosopher praised the movie as ""the best movie I've seen in decades"" (Ayn Rand Bookstore Catologue, Fall 2001).  I personally like the movies philosophic message and I was engrossed watching it but it seemed a bit formulaic to me in that it was fairly predictable and there were no real fireworks, at least for me.  Peikoff is going to love it because it is an attack on Christianity, or certain aspects or interpretations of Christianity, but Christianity has been attacked plenty so it's not like this is an original and unprecedented critique.
  I would definitly recommend the movie though it needed a little more ""boo yah"" for me to say that it's a must see or one of my all time favorites.",1004486400,,1271,4.68018018018018

She opens up a seductive chocolate shop that shocks and infuriates the town mayor and most of the local residents. Obsessed with moderation, the mayor is determined on driving her and her Chocolate shop out of the town (which initially backfires). However, before his plans can take full effect, the stranger warms up the townspeople's cold spirits with smiles and the seemingly magic chocolate. She happily chips away the ice that surrounds the town until a handsome gypsy comes her way. This makes her think twice about her constant need to travel and resistance to belonging. It ends deliciously, and gives you a fabulous feeling.
Chocolat is a dreamy and sweet movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. It was beautifully filmed, and the acting was fantastic. Juliette Binoche was charming and beautiful, and even though he had a fairly small role, Johnny Depp was gorgeous and sported awesome Irish accent. This movie is pretty funny at times too! I loved the priest (a young admirer of Elvis) and thought he was so cute - the mayor controlled him so far as to rewrite his sermons.
The only thing I didn't really like in Chocolat was that it promoted sensuality. Sure, you should certainly enjoy life, and a little pleasure in chocolate won't hurt anyone, but moderation is not bad. According to the mayor, someone who fasts and pracitces intense moderation is better than a friendly, kind ""sinner"". I don't agree with that. You should be more unselfish than self-indulgent. I won't give the movie too much rap, though, for the main character is giving.

  I realize that when a film version of a novel is made, there always have to be some changes.  Yet it is possible to stay true to the novel's characters, plot, themes, etc. in the film.  This was not the case with the film version of Chocolat.  I don't want to give away too much...but significant changes are especially noticable in the central characters, Vianne and Reynaud.

Chocolat is a subtle comedy that shows the failings and greatness in all of us, with a subtext calling for the  inclusion of the suppressed and the healing of wounds imposed by repressive societal precepts.
Great story, delightful whimsy, great acting from a deep cast of fine actors, enchanting scenery, interesting costumes, beautiful setting (ancient French village of Flavigny), wonderful intertwining of great character stories, and, of course, ""chocolat"" sensually and enticingly presented!
The DVD Bonus Materials are also great!
The Director / producer, etc. commentary is delightful, enlightening, and generous.  The ""making of Chocolat"" gives us a wonderful insight into the real people behind the acting facades, and some of the fun they had in making the movie. Also, the ""Costumes"" and ""Production Design"" are interesting.
No real action scenes, so this movie isn't for action fans, but is great for warm cuddling with your lover, or significant other.
If there s a downside, the first half hour is a little slow because it took so long to set up the characters and their issues also, Johnny Depp's character comes into the movie rather late.  But, the scenery and the interesting and unique story is solid enough to carry the audience through this development without notice.",1002931200,8,1456,5.187234042553191

However, Chocolat is one film I have seen lately that has not left me depressed or thinking the movie industry has lost the ability to create anything but a way to make money.  Chocolat's lessons are positive, despite some negative characters and occurrences.  It is simply a great story, told well.  Warning:  If you are buying the DVD to watch at home for the first time, have some chocolate in the house.

1303706,5,B00003CXR1,"Lasse Hallstrom's film version of the Joanne Harris' novel Chocolat is as delightful a confection as were the heroines' chocolate creations themselves.  The plot is intricate and intriguing, carrying the viewer through the emotional transformations of each of the main characters.  In a sleepy medieval French town where life has assumed a repressive structure that has created an emotionally frozen and empty life for even the most highly placed members of its society, the heroine Vianne and her daughter arrive to set up a chocolate shop.  With her wonderfully concocted sweets she manages to liberate some of the denizens of the town, revealing their potential for greater happiness.  The story has a sense of myth, fantasy, and fairytale about it that leaves the viewer with a feeling of personal satisfaction.

This is a film full of strong female performers.  Judi Dench is especially wonderful as a curmudgeonly elderly woman estranged from her daughter and forbidden to see her grandson.  Juliette Binoche does a fine job as the heroine.  She is as fragile and seductive as Monroe in some scenes and as forceful and independent as Bacall in others.  Lena Olin is wonderful as the abused wife who rises from the confusion and ashes of her own ruined personality like a phoenix under the influence of the heroine.
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a ling while, and I expect to order and read the book upon which it was based--something I rarely do.",1001894400,108,1466,4.902834008097166
1303757,5,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"" is a film with a story as richly textured as the confections sold by Vianne in her Chocolaterie.  It is a story of many layers that appears to be one flavor on the outside, but changes as the confection dissolves in our psyche.  On its face, it is a story about an endless drifter named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk, who take up residence in a small French town in the 1950's and open a Chocolate shop right in the middle of Lent.  However, once the initial layer melts away we realize that this is not a story about Vianne, but really a story about the town and its people.
Vianne is more of a catalyst to the stories around her than a story unto herself.  Ironically, Binoche is a lead actor in a supporting role despite having the camera on her most of the time.  If there is one consistent theme that runs through the film it is one of reconciliation.  Prior to Vianne's arrival, several of the townspeople had survived in a kind of stasis, with unresolved issues never addressed or confronted.  Vianne is the straw that stirs the drink and brings various issues into the open to be examined and resolved.
The film has a strong feminist subtext, which is not objectionable by itself, but too often becomes strident and preachy.  Of greater value is the subtle message that provincial ignorance is well served by exposure to new and non-conforming ideas (Vianne and Roux) and that the forces that promote ignorance and conformity out of fear of change (Comte de Reynaud) are no match for the power of knowledge and the freedom to exercise it.  In this way, the film is very uplifting and relevant despite its folksy telling.
As he did with ""The Cider House Rules"", Lasse Hallstrom lets the story dominate the screen, bringing us well developed character studies without excessive directorial stylizing.  Hallstrom's strength lies in character interpretation and in guiding the actors to broaden and deepen their portrayals.  This is clearly evident here.
Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance that earned her a best actress nomination from the Academy.  Judy Dench continues to make great acting a routine, garnering her third best supporting actress nomination for her role.  Lena Olin gives a standout performance as the battered wife struggling to regain her self esteem.  Alfred Molina is also excellent as the oppressive mayor trying to pull the strings of the townspeople in a desperate attempt to maintain the status quo.
This is a terrific film with numerous thought provoking subthemes.  While it is not a powerful film, it is a substantial film.  I rated it 9/10.  It is a delight for the thoughtful and intelligent viewer who enjoys a well developed human drama.",1001894400,6,2716,4.831533477321814
1303758,3,B00003CXR1,"This is a pleasant, though obvious, adult fable, broadly hinting at the often sensual, restorative, and mystical properties of chocolate. A beautiful and mysterious woman, Vianne, delightfully played by the winsome Juliette Binoche, along with her daughter, Anouk, arrive in a remote and very provincial French town, where she rents a patisserie from an elderly, crotchety woman, magnificently played by Judi Dench, and turns it into a chocolatier. From here, she concocts visually dazzling, mouthwatering amounts of chocolates, along with copious cups of hot cocoa made from a very special recipe, that are always sold or given by Vianne with a Julia Roberts style, mega watt smile. Vianne is always kind, compassionate, and tolerant. She is, therefore, a person to be feared by those who lack those traits. That is why she is greeted with bare civility by the town's mayor, wonderfully played by the always underrated, very talented Alfred Molina. He is a sanctimonious, intolerant, unhappy, religious prig, who insists on writing the sermons for the town's young, beleagured priest. Offended by Vianne's easy charm and her resistance to his invitation to attend church services, the mayor, whose hardened exterior hides a profound sorrow, declares war on Vianne, as he perceives her to be a threat to his established order of things.
Meanwhile, Vianne finally warms up and disarms her crotchety landlady, jumpstarts a tired marriage for two villagers, and befriends a battered woman, played with appropriate pathos, delicacy, and spirit by Lena Olin. She also manages a flirtation with an Irish drifter named Roux, well played by Johnny Depp, though they seem to lack chemistry together. She gains the confidence of those willing to become friendly with her through the mystical properties of her chocolates and hot cocoa, changing their lives forever. Though the mayor has vowed to drive Vianne's business into the ground and run her out of town, Vianne hangs on, determined to stay until the North winds blow her and her daughter to yet another unhappy town. What happens in this town, however, ultimately changes the lives of its mayor, the villagers, and even Vianne, forever.
This is a lovely, well acted, and moderately entertaining film, that thematically deals with the mystical, sensual, and palliative properties of chocolate. It is a frothy, pleasant confection. If you want a film, dealing with a similar theme, that will fully satisfy an appetite, however, one need look no further than the superb film, ""Like Water for Chocolate"".",1001808000,2,2547,5.229828850855745

1303761,4,B00003CXR1,"Taking place in the early 60's, ""Chocolat"" weaves together the tale of a tiny French town and one women that changed the lives of its people forever.  ""Chocolat"" may seem cute and simplistic on the outside, but if you watch carefully, you may just notice the amazing amount of symbolism used to portray lessons learned that we take for granted every day - and maybe haven't quite caught on to yet.  The movie begins by introducing the stiff, proper, tiny French town, and its even stiffer and meaner mayor.  See something your not supposed to see? Turn the other way.  Miss mass? Hide in a cave.
A very gypsy-like mother and daughter find haven in the tiny town, doing all that is forbidden.  What's wrong with opening a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent? What's wrong with refusing the mayor's invitation to the Sunday preach? Why does she have to wear black when there's a flaming red dress in the closet? Slowly, the women begins to tempt passerbys into her chocolate shop (which, by the way, is VERY good), all the while earning the hatred of the mayor.  When she becomes associated with the so-called ""river rats"", the mayor despises her all the more.  There must be an end to this 'madness' and he's nearly suceeded in putting the chocolatry out of business for good.
How will a tiny chocolate shop survive in a town such as this? Will Josefine ever face up to her husband? Will the little boy Luke see the light in his grandmother and break away from his protective mother? Will the river rats suffer an untimely fate?

I've always been a movie freak, and knew that ""Chocolat"" was up for Oscars...yet, reviews kept me from seeing it or renting it (I'm so ahshamed to admit it!) Well, the reviews were wrong.""Traffic"" was moving & profound, and OH! so heavy. ""Gladiator"" was very good, but over-rated...my favorite of the Best Picture nominees this year was ""Erin Brockovich"" because it had humor as well as a riveting performance by Julia about an important issue. The luminescent Juliette Binoche has never given a bad performance (absolutely deserved her Oscar for ""English Patient""). ""Chocolat"" is timely, now more than ever. Like a faiy tale, it's a tale about good & ""evil"", but only certain people's idea of evil. Fundamentalist behavior? So appropriate. Johnny Depp is always great, and Dame Dench & Lena Olin and Alfred Molina were so in touch. This is not a trivial film, as some Academy critics have said. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend this to people who love to laugh at intolerance. This is not a film about decadent indulgence (well, not entirely).

1303763,4,B00003CXR1,"First off, Chocolat is a metaphor -- a metaphor for thinking in new ways, trying new things, renewing the human spirit, enjoying life and salving deep emotional wounds. On that level the movie works wonderfully well, with Juliet Binoche giving a marvelously subtle performance that balances her character on the edge of vulnerability while exuding confidence.
Some windy sourpusses reviewing this simple, wonderful and heartwarming tale (How many of those does Hollywood put out a year? Two, three?) seem to focus on The Horror that the main character tempts townspeople with chocolate during Lent, and therefore it is anti-Catholic. Those arguments are simply silly dreck. It's not anti-Catholic, it's anti-dogma and pro-tolerance and pro-living. I suppose those reviewers would be happy if the townsfolk had burned the woman at the stake for being different and a veritable magician!
Unless you will be offended by temptation (in which case you shouldn't see ANY movie), you will find Chocolat a delicious treat.",1000512000,6,1014,5.34375
1303764,5,B00003CXR1,"A fairytale fantasy of temptation by chocolate that is so seductive in nature, you must have some chocolate of any kind close by. The scenes literally drip with smooth liquid pleasure as chocolate is melted and then formed into creations of desire.

Pleasures that await and a temptress who enchants an entire village with the call of chocolate melting slowly in your mouth is the theme around which this story is molded. There are moments of humor, an almost wild wind that calls to Vianne to follow her gypsy spirit and a handsome rover who challenges her sorcery.

While the religious villagers show an outward piety, in their hearts they want to abandon themselves to temptation and happiness. Vianne arrives in the tranquil French town and in her own way changes the future. There are various ideas that are in a way, just a fantasy for some and for others may be a reality.

Issues like having a child out of wedlock, leaving your husband and not going to church are portrayed in a ""you choose the way to live"" light. Morality is frowned on and this film makes no promises to those who don't want to just escape for 122 minutes. I found the religious aspects to be almost a comedy...which is not always a good thing, since those that don't see religion in a good light won't find it any more appealing. It also shed a light on the sometimes misinterpretation of how we are to live this life. Love is essential. There is a balance between pleasure and godliness. Somewhere in the middle you can find peace and happiness.

In the style of a story, adult desires are captured and woven into a tale of pure pleasure. Anything that happens, does so only in your mind. Captivating from beginning to end. As a chocolate lover, I have always known that chocolate holds powers, no other food has. Chocolate brownies anyone. ;>

The appeal of the story comes from those pleasures we want to succumb to. With this movie, you can have all the fantasy and none of the guilt. Well, unless you are eating a container of chocolate brownie ice cream while watching it.

An escape from the ordinary that will melt in your mind...

1303855,1,B00003CXR1,"Chocolat is awful. Juliette Binoche stars in the film (which gives her next to nothing to do), which is sort of ""Where the Heart Is..."" meets ""The Full Monty."" It's a completely offensive liberal fantasy.  The basic plot is that a woman comes to a small town in 50's France, and through the power of her chocolate making, changes their outlook on lives.  The problem with this is that you need to share its viewpoint, which is that all of the townspeople are stupid & blindly follow their way of life & religion since they don't know any better.
The film treats Catholicism as folly. I'm not Catholic, but I was still offended. It takes place during Lent. Binoche's character tempts all of the characters to break their Lenten vows with her chocolate, and this is seen as a good thing. She doesn't attend church & seems to callously brush aside their views on religion. Basically her character's goal comes at the cost of the town's way of life, and we're expected to applaud that.  I just want to warn you that the film, while seemingly sweet, is incredibly subversive in the worst way. It manipulates the audience into accepting the offensive views it has, and then tries to beautify its ugly ideas with mood lighting.
If you watch the film with any sort of rational mind at all, you can't help but be offended. I'm up for magic realism as much as the next person, but this film doesn't work at all. I didn't read the book, but the film is so flimsy. For example, it doesn't explain why the chocolates have the effects they do at all. There's one flashback in which Binoche explains the Indians believed cocoa beans make people lose all their inhibitions. That's well & good, but I don't lose all inhibition when I eat a Hershey's bar. There is obviously something different about HER chocolate and the film does nothing to explain it.

What I had a huge problem with though were its attitudes toward society. It's one of those movies that celebrates vagrants at the expense of people who are settled down in life, but then expects us to be happy when the main vagrants in the story all decide to settle down at the end. I don't mind that the film condemns the church & the town's people so much as that it expects us to be happy when it betrays itself and decides these are good things.

Also problematic is Judi Dench's character. She is presented as a fellow outcast from the town, but she is obviously influenced by what her daughter (the mayor's loyal assisstant) thinks of her. The film definitely wants to be subversive & conformist at the same time, and you simply can't. The condescending way it treats the townspeople in and the pedestal it places Binoche & Depp on both are ridiculous. The film is a total failure (though I'm sure people who don't much think about what they're watching are apt to enjoy it.)",1000080000,44,2821,4.5452755905511815

And the music --- it was wonderful and set the scenes perfectly. I rarely, if ever, like a movie as well as the book, but this was a definite exception. I hated to see it end and plan to watch it again soon.
Enough has already been said about the story, so I will not add more, except to say that the movie was very close to the book. With the exception of a few politically correct changes (the mayor, not the priest is the bad guy and Depp's character is never called a gypsy as he is in the book), it was very true to Harris's novel.
The extras at the end of the DVD were better than any I have seen before. One section was about the town in which the movie was filmed. Another part was a discussion with the costume designer. These parts added a lot to my enjoyment.

1303949,5,B00003CXR1,"If you're looking for relief from the typical Hollywood popcorn movie this is the film for you. Sad to say, but not many films concentrate on simple human emotions and characteristics.  ""Chocolat"" centers on a small French village and one travelling chocolate maker's (Juliette Binoche) quest to enliven the community and help the villagers abandon their conservative mores so they can appreciate the joys of life that are often ignored.  The movie is from the same crew that made ""Cider House Rules"" and as you've seen has been given universal critical acclaim.  The cast itself is full of superb actors and actresses, a real treat for anyone that appreciates quality acting.
The DVD is not a disappointment and offers featurettes that take advantage of the movie's highlights.  For instance, there are two featurettes included with one covering the production design of ""Chocolat"" and the other detailing the costume design.  The DVD also contains a better than average documentary about the overall process of making the movie and a brief history of chocolate.  Along with a director's commentary, the DVD also has a menu for some of the many deleted scenes.  Also included are the usual DVD features: audio/subtitle setup and scene selection.  Another additional perk of the DVD extras are the film trailers included.

There is a fairytale quality to the opening as we see two figures wrapped in red capes swept along by a blustery north wind. They are about to arrive with a secret passed down through the ages and leave our little French village with a new outlook on life.
Our devote village, run by a self serving but dedicated mayor, is about to meet its match. The protagonist is a self-proclaimed single mother who announces to the mayor that she will not be attending Sunday services at the local church. It is the Lenten season and Easter is in the not too distant future so the members of the town have given up sweets as a sacrifice. Slowly they are lured into the chocolate shop where the magic begins to take place.  A wonderful film for all and well worth the viewing time.  Kelsana 8/17/01",998006400,3,857,4.383647798742138

Eventually she makes friends with a few (also black sheeps of the town) and helps them out with a few situations. And in the long run they all come around and keeps her in town, as she decided it was time to move on.

1304006,4,B00003CXR1,"Lasse Hallstrom had the task of making a sweet, light-hearted, and affecting film from a story that delicately mined issues like morality, tolerance, and inclusion.  Not the easiest of tasks but aided by the radiance of Juliette Binoche, he pulls it off brilliantly.  Chocolat is like a fairy-tale, a gently told tale of a provincial French village in the 1950s and the clever north wind- in the form of Viane and her daughter Anouk, that stirs more than the leaves.  Viane is fiercely independent but dispenses her advice and her help- in the form of chocolate- with understated grace. Viane's own life is complicated slightly by the arrival of a river gypsy in Johnny Depp who's freedom of spirit is akin to Viane's restlessness for movement.  The story is perfectly-paced but its best asset are beautiful performances from the cast.  Lena Olin, Judi Dench, and Depp all should have been contenders for Oscars, but it's Binoche who is unforgettable.  The radiance of her smile alone adds a special charm.  It's a shame that she wasn't given the Oscar but, as in Paltrow and Blanchett and few years before, the Academy went for sentiment over quality.  Over all, an amazing, generous performance by Binoche and an all-around delightful film.",997833600,4,1242,4.9375

At first, everyone in the village appears to have a normal, happy life. But we soon discover that things are not always what they appear to be. The happiness is just a cover-up for what greater problems lie underneath. Chocolat comes into the village and uncovers the real problems with the inhabitants. Some of the subtlties in the movie aren't so subtle. All the townspeople wearing plain, muted colored clothing. Then Vianne and her daughter enter the village wearing bright red cloaks. Vianne is always wearing a red-colored outfit, marking her as different from the townspeople as possible. And her opening up a chocolatier during Lent and tempting the otherwise steadfast followers of the mayor and priest only exagerates the tension between them. The actors give good performances but the best is by Alfred Molina as the mayor. His wife has left him but he refuses to admit to it. So instead he attempts to control everyone else in town. But Vianne enters and threatens his control. He fears losing them as he did his wife. In the end we are to embrace one another for what we have to offer and not what lack.

1304009,3,B00003CXR1,"Of all the free spirit liberal rebel vs. hidebound conservative straw dog movies that Hollywood has churned out in the past decade, this is without doubt the most shameless. Director Lasse Hallstrom has fallen a long way from his ""My Life as a Dog"" triumph and has now been typecast as the guy to call when you need a heart-string tugging period piece.
Here the setting and period is an uptight French village in 1959. Vianne Rochon (Juliette Binoche) comes to town to melt their frozen hearts with gourmet chocolates it would have taken a small army to make. She meets a predictable array of allies and enemies before a predictable crisis is raised and resolved.
So what's worth sampling here? I liked the chemistry between Binoche and Johnny Depp, who played a gypsy troubadour. I also liked that the villian Reynaud (Alfred Molina) was more than a one-dimensional lout.
All in all, the film is sort of like a cartoon for grown-ups.
The film I think was hurt more than helped by the oscar nominiation for best picture. It never stood a chance of winning, yet took heat from everyone whose favorite didn't get the nod.",997574400,,1119,4.685279187817259

(I use quotes to denote the stereotyped Hollywood cartoon-type depictions of what liberals imagine religious types to be.) She opens a chocolate shop, which tempts the hapless villagers during Lent. Although the film is about tolerance, she seems completely oblivious or uncaring as to her causing the townspeople to stumble in their religious observances, openly inviting them to sample her wares during the holy season. Although she is rebuked for this, it is done through the unlikeable religious villain, so she's actually given a free pass on this. Figures of spousal, parental, and spiritual authority are ridiculed. Traditional marriage is likewise shown to be defunct. In the cookie-cutter mould of films like these, ""religious"" types resort to hatred, violence, etc. in God's name. There is a little balance, however. At the end, the young priest gives a message on tolerance. This might be good (tolerance = loving the person while rejecting their error) or bad (new tolerance = accepting and applauding error), depending how it is interpreted. Also, the ""bad guy"" is finally humanized, and the townspeople suddenly realize that Christ calls them to love! Wow, what a revelation. They have been living in ignorance of their own religion for decades. Thank God for liberal atheists. Although there are pretensions to deeper waters (""The Sly North Wind"" - perhaps it's better used or explained in the book, but it's utterly an useless device here), it's predictable, without much depth; like watching a long, alternate-world episode of ""The West Wing.""

1304011,3,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"" is a winsome fable, more notable, perhaps, for its mood and atmosphere than for its rather hackneyed plotting and timeworn theme.  It's true that many viewers may be put off at first by what would appear to be the anti-Christian (particularly anti-Catholic) subtext that seems to run through the story.  But, rest assured, the film ends up not attacking religion - merely redefining its terms.
The lovely and radiant Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne, a young unwed mother, who, with her charming daughter, enters a small, morally uptight French village in 1959.  There, much to the dismay of the rigid and intolerant Roman Catholic mayor, she sets up a chocolateri, during Lent of all times, and proceeds to dispense confections that (as in ""Like Water For Chocolate"") seem to exert a magical influence on the villagers who partake of them.  The chocolate is, of course, a muted metaphor for the eternal conflict that has been waged throughout history between those who view sensual pleasures as ""sins"" and those who see them as natural and morally neutral human desires.  The film certainly comes out foursquare in favor of the latter view, showing the dangers that can result when people become obsessed with repressing their basic human needs and end up isolating those who believe, think or live differently.  Vianne, and those who rally to her cause, are viewed as warm and loving free spirits, placed in stark contrast to the mayor and his minions who appear as crabbed, morose and intolerant cretins.
But ""Chocolat"" is less impressive for the story it tells than for the magical mood it weaves thanks to its charming setting, its spirit of sly fun and, above all, the radiance of Binoche, who demonstrates once again that she was truly made for the camera.  Despite the rather bizarre clash of accents that results, the film utilizes a vast international cast that includes American Johnny Depp, British Judi Dench, and French Leslie Caron.
Like many of the rural French comedies on which it appears to be patterning itself, ""Chocolat"" seems, at times, as artificial and lightweight as the truffles it features.  Yet, even though its message is not exactly original and radical, in this day and age when many religions seem to measure their closeness to God based on how many rules they can make for us to follow and how many groups of people they can manage to keep on the outside, it is nice to be reminded that the purpose of religion is to gather people together into a circle of common humanity.  And what better meeting ground than the one truly universal desire we all do share:  our unabashed and undying love for chocolate?",997228800,2,2650,4.868888888888889
1304012,3,B00003CXR1,"'Chocolat' is like any other fable - it features a message, disguised in something which draws you near so that you can experience the message, and hopefully learn from it. The only problem here is, instead of the ""tempting"" thing (in this case chocolate) drawing us near and seducing us with its almost magical rejuvenation, we are hit over the head with the ""theme"" of the picture. But, then again, what exactly *is* the theme?
  The movie is set in a small French town in the 1950s. It appears to a quiet, almost idyllic little village, where everyone is polite to one another, and the streets are safe. There are, of course, a few not-so-nice things occuring, most notably an appalling wife-beater scenario, and many of the townspeople seem to be suffering from an over-abundance of child-like crushes, but do not have the nerve to act upon them. Apart from the wife-abuse aspect, I found myself enchanted with the village.
  But I was apparently in the wrong - at least, in the filmmaker's eyes I was.
  A woman and her daughter come to town. The woman, Caroline (played dryly by Juliette Binoche), sets up a chocolate shop, and it is apparent that her confections contain elements which release the desires within most people. Soon, the crushes become realized, and the abused woman leaves her husband, moving in with Caroline and her daughter. Comte de Reynaud, the head of the town (played well by Alfred Molina), soon becomes suspicious. About an hour into the movie, a river-traveling gypsy named Roux (characterized rather blandly by usually splendid Johnny Depp), arrives, and things go from bad to worse.
  I suppose the ""message"", or ""theme"" of Chocolat, if indeed a message or theme can be discerned, is that you should live life to the fullest, don't hold back. Well, I don't disagree. What I found disturbing was that chocolate was used. The scenes where people were ""changed"" by its powers were odd, even evocative of being sinful. But nothing wrong went on. All these people did were to realize certain hopes and desires (and not bad ones). I guess what I'm getting at is: This is a French town not very many years after WWII. I'm sure it would *not* have been as repressed as it was, given what they went through with German occupation. None of that is touched upon here. Instead, we are led to believe that they are almost Eden-like, untouched by evil, and that only this traveling ""chocolate lady"" can save them. The transformation the townsfolk go through is supposed to be oh-so-big, but it really isn't. And I'm sure chocolate wouldn't have been necessary for it to occur.
  'Chocolat' isn't really a *bad"" movie. The acting, though a little uneven, is pretty fair, the locale pleasant, and the storyline sturdy. It is just the actual ""theme"" of the storyline which I disagree with. This film was nominated for a 2000 Academy Award for Best Picture. Like I said, it is a fair movie, but NOT worthy of a Best Picture nod. Perhaps some of the Academy members tasted some chocolate and......",997142400,,3013,4.754789272030651

The plot is a fairy tale with overtones of social commentary (but aren't all fairy tales trying to tell us something deeper?)and as in a fairy tale everything works out in the end. Hallstrom was lucky to get both Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp to play the leads because they add tons of charisma to this slight tale. It is always a pleasure to watch both of these actors because they make such varied and interesting choices in the roles they play. Compare Binoche in this film with her role in ""Damage"" for example or ""Blue."" Or Depp in this or in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" or the recent ""Blow.""

If you haven't seen that particular title yet, you may have to after watching ""Chocolat;"" I can't think of a more appropriate way to wash out that synthetic aftertaste.  Movies like ""Chocolat"" aren't written or directed--they're engineered.
Perhaps the finest chocolate requires an exact recipe, but provocative and entertaining cinema doesn't.  Just the opposite, really--great filmmaking resists formula.  But this inconsequential fluff piece, which imagines an insular French community where the transforming power of chocolate is enough to provoke life-changing epiphanies, is so blandly predictable, so precisely calculated to make you feel warm and fuzzy, that you almost wish--no, beg--for something unexpected and off-the-wall to happen.
What makes ""Chocolat"" so easily digestible--and what led the Academy to idiotically award the film five undeserved Oscar nominations, aside from Miramax's relentlessly tacky advertising campaign--is the undeniable skill and craftsmanship in front of and behind the camera.  When you've got a director as respected as Lass Hallstrom and A-list talent like Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench, you can be sure it's all going to go down smoothly.  Gorgeous cinematography and sumptuous shots of melting chocolate certainly don't hurt.
But when these ingredients are at the disposal of a script that relies so frustratingly on age-old conventions, a script that obliviously trots out the most pedestrian characters--and from the self-righteous mayor and the battered wife to the innocent boy with the domineering mother, they're all here--you have to wonder what the point of assembling all this talent is.  Binoche does absolutely nothing in this film to warrant her best actress nomination--nothing, perhaps, except to remind you that a long time ago she actually took on challenging roles.  Ditto Dench, who is such a towering performer that she shouldn't even be looking down her nose at a film like this.
The fact that ""Chocolat"" paid off so handsomely for Miramax is disheartening indeed--not only because it cheated far superior movies of their just desserts, but because of the unavoidable suggestion that this film actually says something important.  It doesn't.  What it does, in fact, is indulge a message of staggering phoniness and simplicity.  ""Tolerance"" is the operative word in ""Chocolat's"" artificial little fairy-tale universe--embrace everyone and everything, toss out the narrow-minded regulations and principles that once held you captive, and oh, have a Belgian creme while you're at it because chocolate is the key to unlocking the deepest mysteries of human nature.  It's movies like this that give art-house pretension a bad name.",994896000,25,2937,5.539149888143177

Most of the film is beautiful photographed, except for certain scenes where Binoche is not lit to advantage and therefore made to appear less beautiful than she actually is.
The saving grace of this film is the performances, notably by the children involved, by the magical Lena Olin (who's never turned in a less than fluid performance in her entire career), by Binoche who is growing nicely as an actor, and, always, by Judi Dench. Here is an actress who can take control of any scene without any effort but simply by dint of her formidable presence.

It is the acting that shines, Binoche plays Vianne with a subtle charm and resilience that illuminates alongside with Lena Olin as a battered wife. Judi Dench spices the screem with wit and hard emotions and Alfred Molina is aptly casted as the mayor with the prim and proper decorum. Chocolat is simple as a story that dissects the quandry between temptations and morality, and a lighthearted note on human emotions. Forgivance is seen in the mother and daughter feud, hope when Vianne sees Josephine (Lena Olin) as a friend.

I've read that more and more movies are being shot in the English language simply because the potential box office profit is so much huger. Put simply, this is a delightful film which many critics are probably grading downwards because it is ""just"" a simple story that is simply (but beautifully) told.  I am hardly ready to number myself among them!  Lasse Hallestrom, who first distinguished himself with the marvelous ""My Life As A Dog,"" knows his way around a film script and with actors and it shows.

Playing much like a fable or fairy tale, Juliette Binoche is a woman, Vianne, who wanders from place to place with her daughter, Anouk, setting up shop as a chocolatier. This time she sets up shop in a peaceful French village in the winter of 1959. Delightful as the love story portion is with the river rat, Gypsy-like Johnny Depp, it is the hilarious war waged on Binoche by the town's mayor, played by Alfred Molina, who will reduce you to complete gut-busting laughter. His wife left him and his inability to deal with that fact fuels a lot of his animosity towards Vianne and the general air of sensual repression he wishes to foster in the village.  All of the villagers are delightful characters and Binoche is pulled into relationships with them.  If you need to brighten up your day, this is the movie to get.

Her free spirited atheism enrages the sanctimonious mayor (Alfred Molina), and a battle commences for the hearts and minds of the villagers.
There is magic swirling around Binoche and her chocolatery, blurring the lines between real and unreal and giving the story the feel of a fable.  However the gritty performance of Lena Olin as a battered wife keeps it from floating too far from earth. Swedish director Lasse Hallstrm (My Life as a Dog) once again paints a convincingly chilly portrait of small town life, aided by the capable acting of Binoche, Judi Dench and Johnny Depp in particular.  Be warned, however, the real star of this movie is the chocolate. Don't go on an empty stomach or you may find yourself worryingly distracted from the narrative flow. The story is light on dramatic urgency, but the cast stirs in their own spicy fruit into the half-baked script and the result is delicious enough to satisfy the most gluttonous of appetites.",990057600,12,1307,4.856502242152466
1304167,5,B00003CXR1,"My wife and I as well as another couple enjoyed this film immensely...
Chocolat provides a wonderful insight into the life, strong conservatism and, yes, outright prejudices of the French citizens who live in such vividly picturesque towns and villages. They are not bad people but resist change of any kind and cling to their traditions. It is the price they pay to live in places that the average tourist loves to experience but only for a little while.
The film was heightened by an unusually original and sensitive story but also superb casting, direction and acting.
Juliette Binoche projected an almost ethereal tranquility in her quirky role as the mysterious woman who suddenly appears and opens a chocolate shop and feeds not only the physical but spiritual needs of the suspicious town people who are so realistically portrayed.
Johnny Depp, who I believe is one of the most courageous and talented actors today, was outstanding as the Irish riverboat gypsy. He played his part with perfect understatement and acuity. He [almost] stole the show.
Dame Judy Dench was, as always, excellent as the grandmother with her patented mix of tartness and sweetness, further perfected since her memorable portrayal of Queen Victoria in Mrs. Brown.  The actor who played the very challenging role of the comte/mayor was powerful yet surely gained your sympathies over his own inner pain as the story progressed.
And I thought the boy and girl who played the juvenile roles were both appealing, natural and just delightful. That is a tribute to a fine director.
The young actor in the role of the curate was first rate.
In short, this this a rarity today: a top-notch film for grown-ups that has a message, likable characters within a beautiful setting. The four of us can't wait to see it once more.
P.S. We all agreed the only faux pas was the conspicuous absence of the town gendarmerie, a fixture in French village life.",990057600,16,1921,4.892638036809816
1304168,4,B00003CXR1,"""Chocolat"" tells a fable-like story of a young single mother (played by Juliette Binoche) who, with her young daughter, drifts into a small French village in the mid-20th century. She sets up a chocolate shop, but her efforts to bring some fun to the repressed villagers bring her into conflict with the town's tyrannical mayor (well played by Alfred Molina).
""Chocolat"" is beautiful to see and hear. The fanciful sets and the playful score by Rachel Portman enhance the fairy tale atmosphere of the story. Although there are some unsatisfying loose threads in the script, the story as a whole is delightful. And while the film's message--about the importance of tolerance--may be a bit obvious, it's still worth thinking about.
Director Lasse Hallstrom showed his skill at handling a large ensemble cast in ""the Cider House Rules,"" and he does an equally satisfying job here. And what a cast! Juliette Binoche is excellent in the lead role; both elegant and earthy, she is an enthralling screen presence. The great Judi Dench sinks her teeth into a supporting role as a grouchy landlady who has a tender spot for her young grandson. Johnny Depp is charming as Binoche's love interest, and Hugh O'Conor is absolutely delightful as the baby-faced village priest who secretly loves the music of Elvis.
To sum up, ""Chocolat"" is an appealing comedy-drama with some real touches of magic.",989625600,22,1383,4.991341991341991
1304169,5,B00003CXR1,"Last year, I reviewed the book CHOCOLAT by Joanne Harris. I'm happy to report that this film adaptation is even better than the print version. And how often can one say that with a straight face?
The film begins with a north wind blowing Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) into a small French village at the very beginning of Lent, that pre-Easter period of time, which, in the Catholic liturgy, is dedicated to prayer and physical self-denial. It's not a good time for Vianne, an apparent non-Christian, to open up a chocolate shop across the town square from the church. But, she does so anyway, much to the dismay of the village mayor, the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Reynaud is puritanically determined to shut the shop down, and Vianne is equally determined to keep it open. An irresistible force meets an immovable object.
CHOCOLAT, both the book and movie, is a whimsical comedy that blossoms as Lent progresses, and Vianne's shop becomes a place of healing and sanctuary for several of the town's troubled residents. Because Vianne's store is seen (by the local Church establishment) as diametrically opposed to the spirit of the season, the story can also be taken as a gentle fable of conflict between Christianity and paganism.
Juliette Binoche is exquisite in her role. (I think I'm in love.) Judi Dench is her usual superb best as Armande, an aged widow deprived of her grandson's company by an over-protective mother, Armande's own daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss). There's also a small role played by Leslie Caron. (Where's she been in recent years?) And Alfred Molina is positively brilliant as the uptight mayor, so dominant that he personally writes the Sunday sermons to be delivered by the local pastor, Fr. Henri, apparently only recently ordained and much in fear of the Comte. Johnny Depp has an engaging role as one member of a band of despised river gypsies just floating through.
One very good reason why CHOCOLAT the film is better than CHOCOLAT the book is the added dimension of visualization which the former imparts to several elements of the storyline, specifically the mysterious wind that blew our heroine into town, Anouk's pet Pantoufle, the delectable chocolates themselves (seductively arrayed in the shop window), and the climax of the conflict between Vianne and the Comte.
CHOCOLAT the film is one that will have the audience leaving the theater feeling good, and maybe wishing for a cup of Vianne's hot chocolate with a pinch of cayenne pepper. I can't recommend this cinematic gem enough.",988934400,140,2566,4.997663551401869
1304170,4,B00003CXR1,"No matter how good a film is, there will always be those who find something negative to say about it. Like all other pictures, this is far from perfect, but in my view, it is suprisingly good. Though it has garnered mixed reviews, the positive far outweighs the negatives, and justly so.  It has likeable characters, world-class actors, and never loses its intention of being a comic fable. I completely disagree with those that say this is shallow and predictable (please look up the word ""fable""). This is a thoroughly entertaining feel-good movie, and I left the movie  wanting a candy bar but mostly, delighted at how people come together.  Too bad some of us have become too cynical to even enjoy a charming fantasy.",988156800,12,721,4.752
1304260,4,B00003CXR1,It's a decent French film from 1988 by the director Claire Denis about a French woman returning to colonial West Africa to remember her past.  Complex film about interracial relationships and the past.  It's a bit slow moving and not the fantasy jaunt that the new film of the same name is.  But it's enjoyable.

1304261,4,B00003CXR1,"In a year full of dramas loaded with violence and adult content.  Chocolat was perhaps the cleanest, and one of the best movies of the year.  Chocolat is a very heart-warming story of a mother and daughter who travel from place to place with the North wind.  But they always leave their mark on each town using their ancient, exotic chocolates.  It's not a rip-roaring comedy, nor an intense drama.  Chocolat is just out there; it has no political message, or hidden meaning.  It's just a nice story brought to life by great acting on the parts of Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, and a cast of other loveable characters.  The filming location is in a tiny village in France, which provides an excellent, atmospheric backdrop to the plot of the story.  The film also contains perhaps the best original score written for a movie in 2000.  Juliette Binoche plays her first big American film since 1996's The English Patient, and earns her second Academy Award nomination. (For Best Actress In A Leading Role)  All in all, Chocolat picked up five Oscar nominations including Best Picture.  And it has been a critical success as well, winning the hearts of audiences all across the globe.  Apparently one taste of Chocloat is all it takes.",986947200,15,1232,4.759433962264151
1304262,5,B00003CXR1,"This comic fable inspired me to enjoy the finer things in life- the joy in human interactions and the bliss that simple kindness brings.  While chocolate is the subject around which this charming story is told, the chocolate symbolizes a willingness to hold out a hand to others to comfort and draw them close.  This film's themes are very clear, honest, and forthright which make them all the more brillant.  Vianne, Juliette Binoche's character, rejects the simple-minded prejudices of the small village and instead extends her arms and the warm medicine of her decadent chocolate to any person willing to receive the gift.  This is a story that reminds one of what is beautiful about humanity- you walk away from the film in awe of the beauty of life and with an enhanced faith in the goodness of man.",986860800,2,804,4.762589928057554
1304263,3,B00003CXR1,"This movie may be one of the ""cutest"" movies to come out of last year. The story revolves around a mother and daughter that move along with the wind, blowing into each city, then leaving as soon as they came. The city this time is a little town in France, and Juliette Binoche and daughter arrive to set up a chocolate store during a time when the city is abstaining from sweets.
The story offers some interesting stories, but never seems to carry through with any of them. We see Johnny Depp come into town as a river rat, but he really has no purpose in the film. We see Lena Olin as an abused wife, but for what? Just so Binoche can have a friend? The mayor of the town, Alfred Molina, is out to have the store shut down, with help from Carrie Anne Moss. But no real story comes from them either. Judi Dench is an old woman who connects with her grandson at the store, but did she really deserve a nomination for this?
This film was very unjustly nominated for best picture. There were many more films that could have been put up for this honor. Call it the Miramax marketing machine, but the rest of us will call it a rip off for good movies. This film is charming, and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but when you get down to it, there is really no substance to back the film as a whole.",986774400,4,1302,4.150197628458498

Score: 83/100
""That day, the towners not only heard a song of church, but an enlightening of the spirit,"" is a memorable line said late in the magical film that is Chocolat. The quote in the film kind of rings out to the entire movie - the day that you see Chocolat, it won't just be any movie, it'll be an enlightening, refreshing experience that you're sure to like.
1960, small town France. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her pre-teen daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) move into town and open a chocolate shop just as lent is beginning. The town's small-minded mayor can't accept this and does his best to shut her down, but her warm personality and incredible chocolates manage to win over many townsfolk. Things get shaken up even more when a group of river drifters, led by Roux (Johnny Depp), stop into town (to the even greater distress of the mayor) and Vianne takes up with him. Meanwhile, she's been helping Josephine (Lena Olin) out of her abusive marriage and her equally freethinking landlord, Amande Voisin (Judi Dench) get together with her grandson, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koeing), whose mother doesn't approve of Amande's ways.
The film is overflowing with it's share of brains and complete maturity throughout the character's hard situations. The actors all play these interesting people to absolute perfection, Juliette Binoche shines brighter than she ever has as the eager Vianne, and Judi Dench is her classical self as Armande. Also, actors that didn't get nominated for Academy Awards (Binoche and Dench did) also put in heaps of effort, Lena Olin is believable and eye-widening as Josephine and Johnny Depp as Roux...well, his coolness just goes without saying. The film has a rich and tasty feel to it, you can almost taste the chocolate Vianne is cooking, oh yes...when the cameramen allow the eye of the camera to go on the silky chocolate swishing through the cooking objects and breaking on the bowl, wow, I tell ya, you better be prepared to drool not only at the film and the chocolate, but it's ingredients and content.

It's told in a pretty way, the Rocher chocolate being the building stone and the thread linking people, situations, humour, envy, intrigues together. In the end, this becomes a little too sentimentally dreaming. But pretty it is.",985910400,,504,5.234567901234568

Both stories are about tradition and how everything can be changed by just experiencing new things (in both cases food prepared by a foreign woman). But, although traditional, ""Chocolat"" stills an original story.  And ""one taste is all it takes"" to like this delicious motion picture.
There are plenty of sweets to be delighted in ""Chocolat"": the story by itself, its original score and art direction, Judi Dench's performance; and the magnificent, and wonderful, and pretty Juliette Binoche, whose character, Vianne Rocher, is also part of a tradition and should be set free. And her chocolates....!!!

The movie is a beautiful passion that weaves its way through the village in need of grace rather than rules, and rules, and rules.

1304269,4,B00003CXR1,"Juliette Binoche does not do much with which I can find fault. She is beautiful, talented, unconventional and luminous in this role of a wandering woman and her daughter who open a chocolate shop in a small, conservative French town just as Lent begins. Binoche slowly wins over the townspeople with her delicious concoctions, but the mayor (Alfred Molina) is unmoved, as is a severe women who works with him (Carrie Anne Moss, virtually unrecognisable from her role as Trinity in The Matrix). Binoche's daughter is charmingly portrayed by young actress Victoire Thivisol, who was first seen as a tiny child in the engaging and sad French film Ponette. Binoche's love interest is played by Johnny Depp, who is summarily shunned by the town. Other fascinating roles, the always superb Judi Dench as the woman who rents the shop to Binoche (and as Moss's estranged mother. Moss will not allow Dench to see her grandson, but Binoche conspires to allow grandmother and grandson to see one another secretly at her shop). Also important here are the roles of the abused wife, Lena Olin (real-life wife of director Lasse Hallstrom) and her husband, played well by Peter Stormare (whom you may remember best as the accomplice to the crime in Fargo. He was the blond one who stuffs Steve Buscemi's body into the wood chipper).
