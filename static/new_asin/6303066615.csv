7837909,4,6303066615,"I can see by reading the other reviews that most people can see this movie was made very ""tongue in cheek"". And I love that.
As to the comments about the cheesy concert scene, there are two things you have to remember.
1. At the time that this movie was made, Mr. Hasselhoff was a huge pop star in Germany, the main market for this movie. So while it seems cheesy in the states, over there it would have been gold.
2. From personal experience, that scene was as fun to film as it was on screen. I was one of the extras on that. He is a pure professional and kept everyone's spirits up on a very long HOT LA afternoon. He sang and told jokes between takes, mingled in the crowd and was just being an all around awesome guy.
*If you are curious, The blond down front in a denim jacket with her name in blazing gold across the top and two purple roses down the back was me. Ahhh the 80's and 90's and all the fashion disasters we all lived through LOL

Anyway, see this movie because you love the actors in it, and watch with a sense of humor. It really is a great film.",1473379200,,1067,4.056872037914692

7837911,4,6303066615,"I recently recorded this 1992 made-for-t.v. movie off the ""This"" network because I'm very fond of classic swashbucklers and I was curious about this ""sequel"" to the Three Musketeers.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Sure, there are a few cringe-inducing moments: Mr. Hasselhoff singing while playing five keyboards at a concert in an alleyway, some horrible early 1990s club scene dancing, and a pretty awful soundtrack (the end-titles music is an unendurable synth-pop version loop of Mouret's ""Rondeau"" -- the old Masterpiece Theatre theme).  Also, the names of these modern-era descendants of the four musketeers are strange: John Smith D'Artagnan, Ann-Marie Athos, Peter Porthos, and Bert Aramis.  (It's worth remembering that the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis were the noms de guerre of the Comte de la Fere, the Baron d'Pierrefonds, and the Abbe d'Herblay, so the names Athos, Porthos, and Aramis would not be passed down.) Yet that's to nit-pick.  There's also a serviceable adventure plot involving a mob-engineered kidnapping, competent acting from all the leads, and some very intentionally-funny scenes and quips -- most especially a scene at the employment office between Cheech Marin and Edie McClurg (perhaps best known as the school secretary from ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"").

The key to really enjoying ""Ring of the Musketeers"" -- and the reason I give it 4-stars -- is editing.  I imported my recording into Corel Video Studio and trimmed the following bits: 21:06-21:13, 23:53-25:00, 25:34-27:49 (the excruciating concert scene), 32:23-32:42, 64:38-65:41, 65:39-66:25, and 66:43-67:24.  I also muted the end-credits music and copied the best of the humorous scenes (all with Cheech Marin, as it happens) and placed them at the bottom-half of the screen so that the credits could still be read at the top-half -- similar to the occasional placement of bloopers during end-credits.

This left me with an 80-minute DVD which can be further served by playback at 1.3X -- something available on many DVD players.  The faster playback isn't necessary like the edits are, but it does allow one to enjoy the entire film in under an hour, without it even seeming sped-up (it's surprising how many films and shows are well-served by 1.3X playback).

You may well ask, ""Why should I go to all this trouble for a mediocre t.v. movie from the 90s?""  Most people shouldn't and wouldn't bother, but fans of The Three Musketeers or swashbucklers in general may take pleasure in it.  I had a lot of fun editing ""Ring of the Musketeers"" and I find the resulting film quite enjoyable.",1412899200,,2584,5.138424821002387

7837913,3,6303066615,"This is mostly a comedy piece and delivers on that account, but doesn't have the best kind of story. The camera angles in some scenes didn't need to be diagonal either.",992563200,,168,4.451612903225806
