7428714,3,B0153YA89K,"For me, this film falls into the OK pile.  I was really expecting to see an ominous, eerie, classic gothic romance/horror film with a ""Maurice""-esque same-sex romance twist, but though I didn't exactly dislike the film, I feel it missed the mark in creating the hoped for gothic vibe.  I liked the scenery, I liked the costumes and the two leads were quite handsome and each turned in fairly decent performances as well as the occasional moment of depth here and there.  And, after watching the director commentary I was surprised to learn that most of the film was shot in a public park setting rather than a more formal film set, so, understanding that, I believe the film makers did a good job of both filming and editing to keep modern indicators off screen, thereby helping to solidify the feel of an early 1800's country side setting.

SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:

While those factors worked, sadly, something was missing which kept me from becoming truly involved with the film.  To start, I kept wondering when we were going to be introduced to the eponymous 'Secret Path'.  Was the entire woodland area somehow a secret path...or was the then forbidden same-sex romance between the leads somehow a secret path...?  And, what was the 'path' leading the characters to?  I'm still not sure.

Another concerning factor was that the story was a bit directionless and rambling.  During the first 20 minutes or so, it seemed that the plot consisted almost entirely of the two leads wandering through the woods with occasional breaks for hugging and kissing.  There was almost nothing driving the plot forward except the early indication that our leads were on the run and looking to hide out from the authorities in the secluded ghostly manor house.  As this was intended to be a horror film or at least an eerie film, I felt there should have been a stronger indication that the characters had entered a haunted or otherwise evil place, but the woods remained fairly bright and sunny and our characters stayed oddly cheerful and oblivious.  And, even the dream sequences which provided a bit of foreshadowing didn't seem to do enough to generate the fear factor for the audience.  To enhance the eerie element which should have played well in this story, stronger indications of the unknown looming doom would have helped keep the audience on edge.  The plot was so sparse and the tension so weak that after a while, I even forgot that the characters were supposed to be on the run and hiding from the authorities.

And, I didn't get the whole grave robbing thing.  Why did they leave the evil manor grounds in the middle of the night, strip naked and then dig up bodies which they apparently then somehow hauled to town to sell?  Where did they get a shovel to dig, or a cart to move the body? Why even include this subplot, it didn't make any sense with the rest of the storyline?

Aside from the above critiques, the camerawork was a bit amateurish, but that alone didn't distract too much.

In summary, I liked some things about this movie, but the plot was pretty threadbare, so I probably have to say that the eye candy provided by the lead actors was the best part of the film.",1444348800,12,3181,4.664874551971326

Acting was fairly good; I did believe the two guys loved each other, and the ""Thomas"" person was excellent.  However, it was hard to follow, because the story itself was very weak.  Also they used sudden loud noises to startle the viewer (often crashes of thunder) instead of creating a gothic tale that would lead to a good scary film. I would have rather see a very good tale of fear and death but instead was often just frightened by sudden noise and rapid film advancement.",1451606400,,676,4.392

It is a pity, since the actors where not totally awful actors (they have some sort of good chemistry between them), and nice to the eyes..

THE LOVE SCENES ARE THE MOST REALISTIC AND TENDER THAT i HAVE SEEN ON THE SCREEN IN A GAY FILM,, and are not pornogrphic eben in the softest sense,  The actors give us an honest portrayal, and one that is refreshingly honest,  The problem with the film may have arisen with its concept.  While I applaud the improvisational aspects,  it placed a burden on the actors to come up with the immensely rich performances tthat they give and to create original dialogue and write the screenplay at the same time.  I was continuously confused as to the plot and only knew some of the details because I had read the description.  If the dialogue had been scripted, I think this film might have seen Academy And Golden Globe Nominations,  It should anyway.

Once there they wander about a bit, sleep a bit and use some ready made bivouacs. They also get down to some al fresco rutting. Then one of them starts to have dreams/visions of some friend they left to die. There is also some voyeur called `the gentleman', who sort of appears and makes things look a bit spooky.

I think the above pretty much covers everything. There is also improvised dialogue, which is actually not too bad. The music is rather nice too, if a bit too artsy for some of the on screen `action' and the cinematography is note worthy. The problem is lots of bugger all seems to happen. At 77 minutes it still seemed to be a bit laboured and the ending may leave some feeling a bit short changed.
