recommended only for college philosophy classes where you can put this film's blackest-black worldview in context with lighter ones.

particularly annoying: film quotes Blake but doesn't get Blake's point that the passage from innocence to experience should result in serenity and personal goodness, not despair and personal evil.",1387497600,,454,5.602941176470588
8427258,4,B004EP432I,"Knowing nothing about this movie, I checked it out of the library, and couldn't avert my eyes for a single moment. A warning: some scenes are so brutal they're difficult to watch.

Every scene was masterfully photographed in black and white: perfect faces, beautiful black automobiles, barren landscapes, rubble, tall peeling churches, a relic of Christ on the cross, the interior of a modern building with wires coming out of the sockets, an allegory, I suppose, of any Oppressive Regime.

The dialogue was superb. So was the acting.

Which brings us to the final question: What was the movie about? And does it even matter?

No matter that I didn't understand the plot. The movie was like biting into a succulent fresh pear. Each bite - each scene - was a brilliant slice of life that we only view in night-time dreams or in great films.",1330560000,,839,4.726027397260274
8427259,1,B004EP432I,"I was born in Estonia, so when I saw a good review of this film in the S.F. Chronicle I immediately ordered it online.  I struggled through more than half of it but had to give up the struggle.  Remember Last Year at Marienbad?  Well this is even weirder!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Temptation-of-St-Tony/dp/B004EP432I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Temptation of St. Tony</a>",1301529600,3,428,6.607142857142857
8427260,1,B004EP432I,"An amalgam of metaphors, allegories, similes and bupkiss.  It could well be art!  But it certainly lacks a coherent plot or meaningful dialogue. The viewer's misery is further enhanced by an Estonian countryside that is uniformly dreary, drab, rainy and mud-ridden.  On the other hand, if you enjoy bedlam, gluttony, long silences, cannibalism, dismemberment and simulations of animal cruelty this just might be your cup of tea.",1301529600,4,428,5.358208955223881
8427261,5,B004EP432I,"OR: JODOROWSKY DECIDED TO REMAKE ""LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD"", WE MIGHT GET SOMETHING THAT LOOKED SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

THERE IS A NEW DIRECTOR IN TOWN AND HIS NAME IS VEIKO OUNPUU.  THERE AREN'T MANY MOVIES COMING OUT OF THE BALTIC THESE DAYS, NEVER HAVE BEEN, BUT NOW, FROM ESTONIA, WE HAVE THIS GUY.  I FIRST ENCOUNTERED HIM WITH AN EARLIER EFFORT NAMED ""SUGISBALL"", WHATEVER THAT MAY MEAN, AND THOUGHT THE EFFORT WAS WORTH HONORABLE MENTION BUT HE HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF HERE WITH ST. TONY.  THIS IS BLACK COMEDY AT ITS PURE MOST TWISTED FINEST; AND THEN IT GETS DARKER.  PRETTY DARK.

A VERY OFFBEAT WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD AND A TOUCH OF A REMOTE VISION OF THINGS, AND YOU GET A WINNER OF A MOVIE AS A RESULT.  I STRONGLY RECCOMMEND THIS FILM.",1299715200,6,746,4.481481481481482
