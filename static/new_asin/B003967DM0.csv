Representation concept in filming (and the theatre inside) are becoming in a very original paradigm when the time and space are talkilng to each other, when the causes appear before de effects, when reality and fiction are crashing and melting togheter and when the Newton's Laws of storytelling breaks all apart, becoming the film, a modern history that explains ourselves and our times better, and czech people too.",1393545600,,583,4.7254901960784315
