2742091,5,B000MRA58S,"I have noticed that the reviews on this page kind of looks like a Rocky-story itself!

Some guy comes along and throws a few cheap punches right in our face, saying that Rocky 6 will suck.

But that statement awakes the fighter in all us Rocky fans. So we stand up, eat some raw eggs, put on our grey jogging suit, and put this lousy guy where he belongs: Lying on the floor as he's counted out. We'll show him that Rocky 6 rocks!",1159488000,2,430,4.107142857142857
2742092,3,B000MRA58S,"To all you losers that take this stuff too seriously, GET A LIFE!  Mr. MC was just stating his opinion, and a logical conclusion!  We all know that after the original ROCKY, all the films went down hill.  C'mon the last two really blew!  The recent contender show sucked, Sly's magazine went nowhere, and everything he seems to touch turns to Poo Poo!  Maybe it's been long enough that he can start anew with the ROCKY story?

Just because someone states facts, doesn't mean he hates the thing.  I love ROCKY and Sylvester Stallone in general, but facts are facts!  Boss Fan, try not to be so pompous and anal all the time.  Again proof read your own postings before critisizing!  Try to limit the use of the word ""people"" in one posting, OK?  MC is obviously trying to be witty and humorous in many of his reviews, so take it as it is, and don't make a mountain out of a mole hill!  I really don't think it would be in anyones best interest to put on a gray jogging suit, OK!",1159488000,,976,4.273224043715847
2742093,5,B000MRA58S,"Boss Fan, I think you said it well.  Since the movie isn't set for release until December 22, 2006  I believe that before the ""critics"" can bash it, they should at least see it.  I am giving this a 5 star rating because I am a fan, and based on the first OFFICIAL trailer at [...] I think this movie will give the original Rocky a run for it's money!  Go Sly!",1156809600,,359,3.9444444444444446
2742094,4,B000MRA58S,"I agree with the previous reviewer that one cannot make rash judgements and reviews when the movie is not even close to coming out. I've read excerpts of the plot and I just saw a brief trailer furnished by Real Player.

This movie could end of being closer to the original Rocky than all the other sequels thus it has real possibilities. I for one will go see it.

The premise, as I understand it, the story line has sentimental tones and of course the ususal boxing action. Rocky is now widowed from his beloved Adrian. He is down on his luck and aging. (What guy over forty doesn't know what this feels like).  Balboa just wants to, as he used to call it, ham-and-egg some fights for money and self-respect. A computer simulation is created of a match between the current champion and Rocky, the old champion. Does anyone ever remember the simulation btween Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali? Same thing. In this simulation, Rocky beats the current champ and this sets the rest of the plot in motion. The younger boxer wants to prove it wrong, the promoter wants to make a quick buck and make a circus out of it and Rocky? Well, Rocky has his doubts as well as his self-pride. Thus the fight.

I do not know if he wins or loses or what but, if nothing else, it should be very entertaining. Sly at 60 looks better than most guys in their 30s and I think he knows how to reach an underdog audience.

So, give the guy a break and don't bash the movie before it comes out. I hope this does turn out as a true feel-good story. We can all use one these days.",1153699200,5,1553,4.286689419795222
2742095,1,B000MRA58S,"For the love of all things sacred, please do not go and see this one!  It will make you cry with all the passion in your body.  Do not forget how bad Sly's television program and magazine were!  They failed horrendously!  This movie will sink to the bottom of the sea!  I promise you!

This is the only movie I know that won an Oscar, yet has nearly as many sequels as the Friday the 13th franchise.  Please just go away, Rocky!

That is all!

EDIT: 12/6/2006
I was just listening to Opie and Anthony, and as expected, the first reviews are starting to come in for this bomb.  As expected, Rocky is showing his age, and expected reactions to this fuddy dudy has been ""embarrassment"" at best.  I suggest Rocky take his ""middle age"" magazine, and his ""dinosaur"" antics in a DeLorean time machine with Marty McFly and Doc, back to 1979, when he was a success. Maybe he'll score with Marty's mom?

EDIT 6/4/2007
MCW aka MC White responds:

Well, well, well, a'int that sweet?!  You finally see the movie that you were ""positively reviewing"" before you even seen it!  Ain't that sweet?!  Well, I'm glad!  But you forgot one thing.  To ""eat"" our words, we have to agree with your words.  And agreeable, a'int how I'm feeling just about now.

And I'm a big Sports movie enthusiast...by the way!

I did also see this movie, finally, on DVD.  And you know what?  I thought it was very ""clickish"" and hackneyed and stereotypical.  I really did laugh a lot,... at Rocky, throughout the entire movie.  I can't believe he's still trying to paint himself as this ""castaway"" Philadelphian.  What a joke.  He owns a restaurant, and he wears a sports coat (the same one every night?) and talks to his customers every night, about being this great fighter?

If I were a regular in that fictional restaurant, I'd find myself ducking, and getting very interested in my Pasta Primavera, every time I saw that lout walking towards my table, praying that we didn't make eye contact, for fear of 45 minutes of his ""dwelling on the past.""  Hell, even his brother-in-law let him have it 25 minutes into the film.  And Rocky is probably sustaining his ""alcoholic"" lifestyle with his money.

I did feel his pain, regarding his dead wife.  I can only imagine how his character must have felt.  But what the hell.  Even Basketball players have awesome `cribs' and tight rides.  Why the hell is he driving around in a beat up white van?  Where's his glass house?  Did I miss something.  Did some Nigerian Banker dupe him out of his millions?  Completely unbelievable.  Sorry.  Just stupid and ridiculous!

I don't know why, but I don't find myself ""feeling"" for that type of character that is Rocky, I find myself despising that type of character in films.  And you know what. I specifically remember the reviews for this movie in the San Francisco Chronicle being very similar to what I'm saying here.  Clich&eacute;d and silly.  And stupid.  I also remember Opie and Anthony lambasting the movie, and calling it weak on the radio.  I remember very few positive reviews.  At least this part of the country.

I did enjoy the black and white with red blood scenes near the end.  I thought that was pretty clever, and visually appealing.  I did enjoy the fight scenes, though I though it ridiculous to see Rocky in the ring with a young fighter.  Very silly!

2 stars out of 5.  Barely watch able.

Damn its cool to be # 1 reviewer!",1152748800,6,3409,4.552980132450331
2742096,5,B000MRA58S,"Back in July, soon after this film was announced, I happened upon this page and found a review (yes, a review, six months prior to the release of the film and before a trailer was even officially released) trashing this film.  This is nothing new at Amazon: people bashing things they have not seen because they did not like a previous film, the actor in it, or just think the movie looks bad or is somehow a bad idea.  I wrote a response - not a review of the film, but a response to the insulting review that the writer thought was so clever (yeah, as if making fun of a ""Rocky"" sequel is both original and clever) - in which I urged people like this to wait until the film is released before they write such things.  I said the movie may or may not suck, but wait and see it first.  Maybe that day I was just fed up with seeing premature reviews that can not actually be trusted by Amazon readers popping up everywhere.  But the good news is that reviewer and all the scoffers can get ready to eat their words.  Not only was ""Rocky"" a terrific movie in my opinion, but the critics love it too.  Over at rottentomatoes.com, the movie review website that comes up with an average score for a film based on all the reviews from the nations top 200+ critic, ""Rocky Balboa"" is at 80%, meaning out of those critics' reviews, 80% have been favorable.  This may sound like no small feat, but for a movie that everyone laughed off and seemed doomed from the start - at least from a critical perspective - it is damn good.  Actually, it is damn good by any standard.  80% actually places it among the better reviewed movies of there year (critics don't like quite a few movies - 80% and above is a somewhat elite bunch).

See MCW; should have waited...

But forget all that.  Those stats are really just semantics.  The real question is, will fans and non fans alike be able to be swept up again by Rocky after all these years and a few rote sequels that have diminished the memory of the original, and just how great and effective a film it was?

The answer is a resounding and surprised 'YES!'  And the reason why:  Sylvester Stallone.  As writer, director, and star - and the guy hanging it all on the line - mainly meaning his dignity if this thing is the flop most people are waiting to see - this movie is all his.  That this movie inspires and excites and entertains to such a large, unexpected degree, means the kudos then should be all his as well.  All of Rocky's speeches in the film about life hitting hard, having to hit back, how many hits can you take and keep comin', doing what is right for you, listening to your heart become a huge metaphor for Stallone and his reviving of this character.  I won't spoil Rocky's outcome in the film's main event, but Stallone himself wins big by following those credos.

Confession time:  I am not a huge ""Rocky"" fan.  I remember loving the first one, but it has been years since I have seen it.  I hated the last two and the first two sequels were okay at the time when I was a young kid, but seem pretty much a relic of their time to me now.  Also I am a jaded-as-hell movie-goer when it comes to underdog sports movies.  They are all the same and I can not think of one, supposedly inspirational, spots flick that ever affected me. (This does not include movies like ""Million Dollar Baby"" (one of my all time favorites), and the like in which a sport in the film is secondary to the actual story being told.  I'm talking about all these interchangeable underdog flicks that we forget which one is which as soon as a new one comes out which, in the last year and a half alone includes ""Invincible,"" ""Gridiron Gang,"" ""We Are Marshall,"" ""Glory Road,"" ""Coach Carter,"" ""Miracle,"" ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""The Rookie,"" and so many more I couldn't possibly name them all.  Come on, admit it; even if you are a sucker for these kinds of films - and I'm not saying they are all bad, some are good, just that there are too many of them and they are all usually similar and uninspired - you know they all play the same card the same way.  The sad thing is we have great, old-school sport films like ""Rocky"" and ""Hoosiers"" to thank for this ungodly influx of these films.)

Watching the new ""Rocky"" film, I may have figured out why these movies always leave me so cold, beyond the fact that they are all so similar.  I never felt like I knew any of the cookie-cutter characters in most of those films (I knew them as caricatures from dozens of like movies, but I never thought of them as anything resembling real people - just composites of sport-film clichs), I never felt like I cared much what happened to them because I didn't know them, and I figured we all sort of know what the outcome will be (any number of standard variations on coming from behind to win, losing but learning the all-important life lesson so by default one wins, or tragedy strikes and tears are supposed to swell as the booming score does - very few surprises or anything original in most of these movies).  What Sylvester Stallone does with his script for this film changed all that.  It doesn't exactly avoid all the old chestnuts of sport film lore, but he turns them on their ear just enough.  Even if he didn't, that is not the films biggest feat.  No it's biggest feat is that as a viewer you feel so sucked into the film, caring so much about this character.  You can relate to him.  And even though most of our life experiences don't exactly parallel Rocky's plight, his inner struggle - which he explains in a brief but oh-so effective speech to his son - is something both inspirational and that hits so close to home, whatever your fears, regrets and proud moments may be.

And don't forget, WE DO KNOW Rocky!  The world knows Rocky.  Watching the bout in this film felt like watching an actual fight you have something invested in.  You care about the outcome because you care about the fighter.  Just like a real fight.  You feel invested in it.  From the training montage on, the audience reacted verbally and with claps, and - in a few moments - tears, to everything Rocky did.  I can't begin to say how surprised I am that Stallone was able to pull this thing off.  What sounded like a joke, and any easy target for jokes, from the get-go, turns out to be one of the most exciting (save for a maybe too-long and indulgent first half an hour or so) and freshest feeling films of the year.  It's so old fashioned it almost feels new again.  It's classic.

Sly has always been a better actor than he is given credit for.  It will be just as easy for his detractors to pick apart his performance here, but if you get it; what he is doing, what Rocky means to him as a metaphor and what he is trying to give the fans of the series, he is nothing short of charming - often extraordinary - in his performance.

I can not tell you how surprised I am by this film.  It may not work so effectively on you if you don't see it with a theatre audience that roared as loud as the crowd in the movie itself; or if you are too cynical and just looking to find a reason to hate this film you may find them.  But I - a jaded sport-film hater - found myself choked up a few times, on the edge of my seat others, and applauding like an idiot in hopes a fictional character would just be able to stand in a ring for a few rounds.

It is surprising and exciting just how pumped up this movie gets you.  Rocky is again the underdog - and so, as I said earlier, is Stallone.  You want Rocky to win just as much as you want Stallone himself to be triumphant.  Just as Rocky has been counted out in the ring, so has Stallone as a serious actor.  You begin to realize you are rooting as much for Stallone as for the character he has created.  And the excitement of seeing them both fighting their way back is at times an exhilarating - and emotional - experience.

So, some scoffed at the idea of this sequel, saying things like 'let the character die with dignity.'  The true indignity would be to have allowed this franchise to go out with the tepid ""Rocky V,"" which was about as far from what made the original so great as the series ever got.  With ""Rocky Balboa,"" not only does Sly sign off with dignity, but he leaves the series - and the character - with a renewed vigor and greatness and humanity that has not been seen since the original.  And this one may be even more inspiring in its message.

And Sly, oh yeah, he's still got it.  And, yes, he's in great shape for 60.  Hell, great shape for 30.

Hate if you must, but you are missing out.  Hear me when I say this - from a guy who is not a fan of sports movies:  I truly believe ""Rocky Balboa"" is one of the best films of the year.  It may technically not be all that original, but it is one of the best, most exciting, entertaining, feel-good times you will have at a movie all year.  Even my girlfriend was duckin' and jabbin' in her seat and clapping and crying with the rest of the true ""Roco"" fans - and she'd never seen one ""Rocky"" film in her life.

Oh  I  still  watch  it  from  time  to  time.  I  don't  though  think  I  could  ever  enjoy  it  as  much  as  the  other  Rocky  movies,  &  for  several  different  reasons.  1.  Why  wasn't  this  one  made  shortly  after  Rocky  5?  2.  There  is  no  sign  of  Apollo's  trainer,  remember  him?  He's  the  one  that  trained  Apollo  in  the  first  2  Rocky  movies,  then  he  trains  Rocky  in  Rocky  4?  I  don't  know  what  happened  to  him  exactly.  He  should  have  also  been  in  Rocky  5.  3.  Adrian  is  also  gone,  died  from  cancer  I  think.  He's  got  his  son  at  the  side  of  the  ring,  &  helps  him  during  his  training.  Telling  him  not  to  give  up,  has  him  for  encouragement.  Rocky  3, 4, &  5  are  probably  among  the  most  popular  in  the  entire  series.  At  least  he  fights  &  gets  in  the  ring  for  better  reasons.  He  doesn't  overcome  his  main  problem  in  Rocky  5  so  he  can  get  his  stuff  back  &  move  back  into  the  house  he  was  in  at  the  beginning  of  the  movie.  He  just  shows  the  world  that  he  is  no  quitter.  (Sylvester  Stallone)  is  what  about  70  years  old  in  this  movie?  I  liked  him  better  when  he  was  younger.  Everybody  thinks  he's  over  the  hill.  That's  why  the  reviews  aren't  that  good.  I  could  picture  Stallone  having  some  kind  of  restaurant  in  reality  that  was  named  the  Italian Stallion  or  whatever  it  said.  Just  not  in  the  movie.  (Burt Young)  did  okay  as  Paullie.
In  this  movie  I  believe  he  fights  (Mike Tyson)  if  I  remember  right.  Not  the  real  Mike  Tyson,  someone  playing  Mike  Tyson.  Clubber  Lang  Tommy Gunn  &  Ivan Drago  were  all  better  characters.

The premise of Rocky 5, of him losing all his money and moving back to the Hood was a bit of a stretch, his return to fighting at an old age in 6 was equally far-fetched, and the main character in the latest movie Creed just wasn't as loveable as Rockys character.

I was NOT disappointed!  It is a very good show, and if you liked the other Rocky's you will surely like this one, too.  He IS much older, but it is just good to see him again, ol' Rock.

2742531,5,B000MRA58S,I grew up with Rocky. I remember being only 2 years old at the cinema with my parents loving every minute of Rocky 4. Im 32 now and Rocky is my idol and a character one can truly admire. I waited 16 years for this film after the highly dissapointment of Rocky V which the directors cut should be released. This is a beautiful film that truly captures the magic of the original which is a masterpiece work of art. If there's any sequel after the first that's worthy of praise close to the original then this is it. I'm an actor director myself and everyone who says Stallone can't act etc...well I pitty there opinion. Stallone is alot like Rocky he is Rocky and he's also my idol. This is a wonderful closure to the Rocky series how ever as we all know it wasn't with the new film creed which is an abosolute delight and a great film on it's own terms and once again seeing my hero was such a treat once again. What star wars is to its fan well Rocky is my star wars however im hoping creed is the final film and is not EVEN as great as this film.,1448841600,,1047,4.087378640776699

2742552,5,B000MRA58S,"I liked this movie very much and give it 5-stars. Even if you're not a boxing or Rocky franchise fan, this is a nice feel-good story about the aging boxer Rocky Balboa (Silvester Stallone) giving it one more shot 30 years later. Please do not continue reading if you don't want spoilers.

Since I am an aging ""fighter"" myself, 55 going on old, I can appreciate Rocky's intent (and I'll bet Sylvester Stallone himself needing to make a statement or send a message to us). Like Rocky, I still have something left in the basement that I would like to get out, not in boxing, but in other endeavors and ambitions. So this movie inspires me. Fighers fight.

As Rocky counsels his son Robert, it's not how hard you get hit, but it's how hard you can get hit and keep on moving forward. And nothing is going to hit you as hard as life does. Words to live by.

It is poignant that Stallone brings around full circle the story of Little Marie who was just a teenager in the original Rocky. I also appreciated that Rocky surrounded himself with those closest to him as he trained and at the ring for the fight -- his son Robert, little Marie and her son Steps, Adrian's brother Paulie, and Duke the trainer.

Paulie himself has a coming of age being let go from his lifetime career in the meatpacking house, and recognizing how nasty he was to his sister Adrian but how much he really loved her, and ultimately being linked as a lifelong friend to Rocky through Adrian.

Finally, the movie does not end with the fight, but ends with Rocky at Adrian's side, at her gravestone, the love of his life forever. How can you not like this movie -- the main event, and a love story.",1447545600,,1664,4.372168284789644

He took the loosing of his crown with grace and dignity.  He learned to be more tolerant of others, the girl that he met
again. Of  Polly for his attitude.  You see another Rocky.  A Rocky that I almost passed on until a friend suggested I see it. There is a human element that was missing from the previous Rocky's and I consider it the best  Rocky  yet",1409616000,,659,4.184
2742763,5,B000MRA58S,"Rocky Balboa is ""THE"" sequel to Rocky. Rocky is a great movie franchise BUT only Rocky Balboa is only one that holds a candle to first film. Despite the fact that it does not have Burgess Meredith and most especially Talia Shire,who portrays Adrian,Sylvester Stallone provides a great conclusion to the story of a boxer that has become part of the American culture.

The sixth film provides us great memories of Rocky I particularly when he once again climbs into the ring this time against Mason ""Line"" Dixon as the underdog due to his age and absence in the sport for so many years now. Adding to his woes as he climbs to the ring are other issues such as the death of his wife and his strained relationship with his son.

The story is something that many people would respond to as it was entertaining and poignant. This time,we get to see Rocky go for a comeback will ultimately become a symbol of hope for the common man. I think that this theme once again gives inspiration to many Americans especially during these tough economic difficulties that they are currently experiencing and the film provides them hope especially when the country's problems only gets worse and no solutions can be found.

2742803,5,B000MRA58S,"The Story of Rocky has Touched Millions of Lives across the Globe. And in My Humble Opinion The Entire Series was told Magnificently through its 6 Chapters.

Therefore as a Screenwriter myself I need to make something perfectly clear to you Sylvester, You Will Forever Be Known as ROCKY and I have written the Final Chapter to this story but its Not about boxing at all whatsoever but rather about Family and the Bond between A FATHER & his SON and how Rocky can still Win without throwing a single punch.

In fact let me tell you a story, on December 20th 2006 when the last Real Rocky film hit the theaters, I was at Tysons Corner Center in Virginia, enjoying the film and was very pleased with how you moved my favorite Character forward in his life.

However upon leaving though, and subsequently days and weeks afterwards, all who know me and what I do, kept asking me, well how did you like the 6th installment, from the Italian Stallion J? Was it fulfilling? Come on now tell us, spill the beans man.

And my reply was always the same, I simply calmly told them that I loved it, but I wasn't happy with the ending, because I knew something was missing.

Then immediately I was hit with, are you kidding me man?? Sylvester just said that he was totally done with the Rocky Character, finished, through, this was it for him.

Then I gave a look that everyone knew that I meant Business and said, ehemm What Did I Just Say???

Then they said, well Mr. Javinno Puricelli, get to writing The 7th and Final Chapter then man, and quit wasting our very valuable and precious time. And put this story that you love so much, thats been with you so long to bed the right way, once and for all.

Come on let The Sicilian Creativity of Originality Within You, Come Out For All The World To See.

Now I couldn't help but laugh at that statement, seeing that I was told that by so many. However, I took it seriously enough to write the script anyway and saw it for what it was and put pen to paper and wrote THE ENDING as I saw fit.

And on May 18th 2007 when I completed the Script, I made two stops that day, the first was Philadelphia, and no I didn't run up the Museum Steps, or get my picture taken with the Statue, like everyone else does.

No, I took a pass on that and chose rather to go to a place that read 1818 because that meant more to me, than anything else. And seeing that place still standing put a smile on my face, and I knew at that moment that I was really meant to do this.

Then I knelt before GOD The Father and thanked him for allowing me to have such a talented way of writing, then headed for home.

However when I got back to Virginia a detour was made, that prone me to make a second stop, which put me right back where I was, when I was first dared to write the Screenplay in the first place, Tysons Corner Center.

And one of my relatives laughed at me and said J what route are we on man?? I looked back and smiled because the road that we were traveling on was, Route 7 Leesburg Pike.

Look here, the Script that I wrote out of Love I Titled BALBOA to signify THE END because Sylvester started this Powerful Story with just ROCKY which signified THE BEGINNING.

Therefore The Final Draft for BALBOA Reg # PAu 3-657-299 was Copyrighted on January 17th 2013 because I knew I wrote a real story of Power for a Character that I Love.

I didn't write it to be  more Famous or ride the Success of Sylvester like somebody else is trying to do right now with their waste of time spin off merely trying to boost their own names in the hope that the public will love them as much as this powerful ITALIAN story is beloved.

But here's a hint though... if you can figure out what 1818 really means and the lessons found throughout the Rocky films that have nothing to do with boxing then you will get a very clear picture of exactly how this ITALIAN story is going to End.",1403049600,2,3886,4.219973009446694

Unfortunutly it's tough for me to explain why this was great (it has been awhile since I saw it). It did have strengths the first three movies had such as Rocky being stuck in an ok but not great situation, Rocky then defies the odds and fixes himself and Rocky also helps his friends and family. However the messages are harder to understand. I understood them, but there will be those that won't.

Weaknesses the movie possess are the villain is a little harder to understand but eventually we do understand him and some of the modern ways of discussing fighting will throw some Rocky fans off.

He did not need the money, and knew no award would be given.  Stallone was very well aware hollywood would make him out to be joke for making this at his age.  I had the pleasure of talking with Stallone right before this movie came out.  I am involved in nutrition, and was fortunate to be invited to a trade show in Vegas.  It was not open to the public.  To my amazement Stallone was walking around with no visible security.  I walked up to him and talked for about half an hour about nutrition, politics, religion, and working out(obviously not to a large extent).  The Rocky character is no stretch for him.  He is like an intelligent Rocky.  Stallone is a strong Christian.  He was saved in 96 when his daughter was born with a birth defect.  I am just a pion compared to him, so the talk time and picture meant a lot to me.  I was living a life of debauchery when I met him.  So I did not think much of the Christian stuff.  I was saved in 2011, and my life has never been better.  I would love to meet him again to talk about Christ instead of tuna.  I know I did not review the movie, but it was truly the best or one of the best movies of the year.  There are a lot of Stallone haters.

The final fight seemed manufactured and not authentic like all the other Rocky's. The real life boxer who played Rocky's foe was flat, reading his cheap remarks, he looked overweight as well. He was cast for his boxing background I'm sure. The bratty girl in the movie was annoying. Rocky 5 felt more genuine to me.

More than anything else, Rocky is here, more than ever, what he was from the beginning--an underdog fighting back--again, and again, and again, and again...-- in a life that can rough you up pretty good now and again.  Most importantly, rather than falling victim to the ""upping the ante"" temptation (like he did so many times there in the ""middle movies"") and having Rocky's final battle being against a twelve-foot outer space vampire cyborg, Stallone goes right back to the utter simplicity of the first film to close out the series in a most dignified manner:  just suiting for an old man who's done one hell of a lot of inspiring.",1374883200,,933,4.711656441717792

I feel this is on par or even better than the original Rocky, if that's possible.  Sylvester Stallone gave us something we sorely needed:  closure.  This movie shows a more mature, wiser Rocky, still with heart and still the Rocky we all came to love.

This movie is a tearjerker (at least for me).  Maybe that's because it brought back many memories for me.  Aside from personal memories, the genius of this movie is that it conjures up all the old, lovely memories from the original Rocky movie, while keeping everything fresh and real and smart.

2743015,5,B000MRA58S,"For the sixth and final film of his legendary boxing series, writer/director Sly Stallone brings back characters only seen some 30 years earlier.

Spider Rico (Lovell), the opponent defeated by Rocky Balboa at the start of the first story, is now punch drunk and a recipient of the ex-champ's affectionate protection. Little Marie (Hughes), the teen who insulted Rocky when he suggested she clean up her act, is this final picture's leading lady. Sly's kid brother Frank, who had singing cameos in the first three movies, appears briefly in a restaurant scene.

Archive footage vividly depicts several ghosts from Rocky's past: his beloved wife Adrian, manager and best friend Mickey Goldmill, and ring opponents Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang. Conspicuously missing is Apollo Creed, although Rock reminisces about their epic first bout.

SYNOPSIS--
In this emotionally moving last chapter, Adrian's dead, Rocky lives only for the past. At 55, he has bouts of melancholy over her loss. Paulie (Young), Spider Rico (Lovell) and trainer Tony (Burton) are all that remain of the old days. Even the ice rink where Adrian and Rocky had their first date is rubble.

A computer simulation of Rocky fighting current champ Mason 'the Line' Dixon (light heavyweight champ Tarver) revives interest in the old slugger. Somehow, undefeated Dixon convinces Rocky to meet him in Las Vegas for an exhibition match. In doing so, Rocky is able to put to rest forever all the old memories that have been troubling him.

2743055,3,B000MRA58S,"This movie was...interesting.  As others said, it's pretty sad and depressing, but life can be that way.  It's perfectly understandable to mourn a spouse but after three years it'd have been sweet to see him just begin move on, either with Marie (too May-December?) or another nice lady.  He could even get some ""sign"" from Adrian that it's okay to move on! But, the man has always dealt with life by stepping into the ring, so there you have it.

I liked how he told his son not to let anyone treat him like crap, but notice how even after seeing Robert's boss be a jerk to him, Rocky was still polite to the boss, for Robert's sake.  He's come a long way. :) Normally he'd just pound the guy into the ground.

I liked the closure of a ""draw"" that ultimately goes to the other guy (just like in the very first fight with Apollo).  Because it didn't matter.  Rocky went the distance and still felt victorious.  It was that way in 1976 and it was that way this time.

I liked the nostalgia, too.  It was all so bittersweet. I loved that Duke was still with him, and that he and Paulie were still close.  They both loved Adrian so, though Paulie used to be so mean to her.

In summary: It's not the Feel Good Movie of the Year, and Adrian being gone is so damn sad.  And again, it would have been really nice for Rocky to have another woman in his life, in his corner. Well who knows? Maybe he does develop something with Marie! We don't know. At least she was in Vegas, playing the role of ringside female companion, cringing at the bad blows! I was glad he had that; he always had that with Adrian.

The appearance, somehow, of Drago and Clubber would have been AMAZINGLY cool but I can't fathom how that would work! Tommy Gunn, too, but with BETTER HAIR! I could never get past his hair.

Having Spider Rico around was an obvious attempt to wrap things up full circle (he's in the very first seen of Rocky); sort of gratuitous.

Stallone's body is pretty smoking for that age, but his awful plastic surgery (facial) is VERY distracting.  I'd give my right arm to see what he and Mickey Rourke would look like had they never carved up their faces.

Bottom line: Totally watchable but rent, don't buy it.  It's not a big time investment and all Rocky fans should get the closure! Just don't make a big Blu-Ray or DVD investment.",1344124800,,2327,4.330254041570439
2743056,3,B000MRA58S,"Otherwise known as Rocky VI, this Stallone driven drama is not too bad at all. Having milked the franchise over the years Stallone is still able to pull the heartstrings. This one focuses on Rocky's comeback from retirement in an exhibition match with cocky prize fighter. You are on Rocky's side all the way as this capitalises as the battler making it good against all the odds, in other words the same formula as Rocky's I to V. Somehow it still works and this one is quite different than the others as Stallone really is getting too old so there is no denying where the agenda of the film lies.

The fight sequences are suped up with music video style jump cuts, slow mo, razor sharp edits and some chilling camera work. It again works fine. Rocky is reduced to a shell of what he used to be since his fighting days but the drawcard of the film is to see how he overcomes the odds to get back in the ring and make a contest of himself. The acting is top notch, Adrian is featured in dream sequences showing how Rocky focuses on the past. It is great to see old timer coach Burt in his reprised role again. I like the scenes where Rocky is making friends with a new girl and her son, he seems genuine and is very honourable in his intentions.

It is a likeable film, no swearing at all, and just a bit of blood when they get in the ring and slam each other into kingdom come. But that is expected. The final credits are fun showing many ordinary people making the famous run up the steps and, yes, Rocky music and the famous run up the steps happens from the big man himself, as well as thumping meat, downing raw eggs and running in the snow with his pet dog Punchy. It does not disappoint as a homage to the old Rocky's and Stallone in a hat looks the same as ever; the no good bum who fights for his passion, and it is not all about winning.

2743059,5,B000MRA58S,"What makes this DVD release so special is the additional features, in particular, the commentary by Stallone.  In it, he speaks of the story line, the camera work, the lighting and the thought that went into each scene.
The movie shows us the 'dumb' Rocky, with slower speech and seeming inability to reason well, when, in fact, the character's 'dumb' responses are actually wisdom and patience, as the character sees, for example, an obnoxious and superficial boss at his son's job, yet does not comment on it.  When dealing with brother-in-law, Paulie, Rocky allows him to take his verbal shots, yet remains kind.  In this, the writer attempted to make a Christ-like character in which he lives to benefit others, sacrificing for others.  It's a wonderful, touching movie and restored to us the lovable character from Rocky I and Rocky II.  The additional of Geraldine Hughes (""Little Marie"") was a perfect piece of the puzzle, allowing the audience to see Rocky fall in love, as he still has a future, in spite of his age.  Critics will ridicule as they do, but audiences loved the movie, and will continue to love the DVD, especially the cut out scenes and the alternate ending.  One of my favorite movies!

You'll cheer. You'll laugh. You'll cry. But more importantly, like the first Rocky, you'll be inspired. Stallone does a fantastic job bringing Rocky full circle and giving ""Rocky Balboa"" the same feel and texture as his original.  We know Stallone missed the mark with Rocky IV and, to some degree, Rocky V. Not with ""Rocky Balboa""

""Rocky Balboa"" introduces us to the most human Rocky since I and II. It's also amazing to watch Burt Young work. He brings one of Hollywood's great characters back to life and does so in such a superb way. You feel for Paulie. He's so socially inept, abusive and unaware of who he is. His outward language screams ""leave me alone"", yet he needs Rocky. Without Rocky, Paulie would've died a long time ago. Watching Stallone and Young be these characters again is amazing. The chemistry between the two never changes. Thankfully. As a ""Rocky"" fan, once Burt Young says ""..Yo Rocko.."", you know you're  home again and that, in a way, you're reuniting with old friends. And that's the magic of Rocky. You know these people. You've grown up with these people. And with ""Rocky Balboa"", we're all together once again.

Add to this Bill Conti's inspiring and sometimes haunting score and ""Rocky Balboa"" is an undisputed winner.

Rate: 6

5/08: Much better than I anticipated and even exceeded my expectations, I thought Rocky Balboa was going to be the worst Rocky movie in the series, even worse than Rocky V (it's still a painful to think about it). Lo and below, Rocky Balboa is back and charms his way throughout the picture. I've not had so much fun, and I love the whole package. What Sylvester Stallone brought to Rocky Balboa is the old memories and characters. At the same time, he merges his past with the present, showing no hard feelings or bitterness about how things are different and/or changed. He just has a different perspective on them, and interestingly, Rocky Balboa is old school meets new school, just a real nice fresh change for a turn. The editing work is unlike the crap I see nowadays with an interesting back-and-forth of the natural, part of the film and the fight show. I like that. Sylvester Stallone (whose best acting bit is when he gives the speech to his son before he goes back in the restaurant) is phenomenal playing Rocky again, and it's the role that he was born to play. Everybody else is great also. It's too bad not seeing Talia Shire again, but actually her death contributes a great deal to the story and makes Rocky Balboa to work. A real good asset indeed. Another thing I like about the story of Rocky Balboa is how Stallone combines the juvenile mentality of ESPN (you know, the crap about who is the best and the fictional versus thing that dominates the show instead of showing some real sports) and the need for Rocky to come back and actually fight. It makes total sense, and the fight is awesome. The best part...well, there is so many of them in the movie, but the best part is how Rocky Balboa ended. It shows how much we know that Rocky didn't care about the fight result but the actual result of winning the true fight. That display shows what is more important, and Sylvester Stallone does that admirably well. That's why I loved the movie. The feeling that I get out of Rocky Balboa is more jubilant, emotional, and refreshing than I've felt for a long time. I always think of a movie that could be made in sort of ""back to the old times again"" in a ""where are they now?"" And Sylvester Stallone does just exactly that. Mike Tyson trashing-talking with the current champion is hilarious, reminding me of the press news conference post-melee where Iron Mike yells at Lennox Lewis, ""You scared coward. You ain't a man enough to **** with me."" All in all, Rocky Balboa is a great, inspiring feel-good movie that is almost (I'm wincing over that rap song for Mason Dixon's entrance) completely free of anything that's improper and brings back the memories again to the point that I feel like I want to watch the whole series all over again and relive that ""Gonna Fly Now"" scene atop of the steps in front of the Philadelphia Art Museum (now moved back to below next to the steps). This film deserves a `10'.

8/11: I am going to lower my rating of Rocky Balboa from `10' to `6'. To be honest with you, it's just not a very good film. Of course, it is filled with memories, but we can always watch first five pictures to relive them. So, what is the point? It is hard to for me to stomach Robert Balboa, a whelping that needs to be beaten up by Rocky to set his priorities straight. Also, it gets pretty tiresome to see Paulie making the same, usual complaints. If he is going to be like that, why should I bother to care? Then, Rocky goes into several different directions at once, letting the film to have no real clarity what the message intends to be. In short, not much really happens in the film. The most atrocious aspect of it is the camera work. Does the cameraman suffer from a bad case of arthritis? At least the fight at the end is the best part of Rocky Balboa. All in all, time for the Rocky series to die for once and all.",1312934400,,3882,4.405292479108635
2743099,5,B000MRA58S,"In this movie, ESPN broadcasts a computer-simulated fight between Rocky and the current heavyweight champion [which is likened to the famous 1970 Ali-Marciano computer fight]. The computer fight inspires Rocky to make a comeback at an advanced age.

Kevin King, producer of Rocky Balboa, discussed in the Rocky Balboa DVD bonus feature that the Rocky Balboa movie was inspired by George Foreman's comeback to win the title at an advanced age. In his comeback, George was older, wiser and re-invented himself to become a popular fan favorite. Foreman went on to win the title in an amazing comeback after a 10 year hiatus from the ring.

Former heavyweight boxer Pedro Lovell appeared in both the original Rocky movie and in the 2006 Rocky Balboa movie. Like George Foreman during his comeback in real life, Spider Rico in the Rocky Balboa movie is older and wiser.

2743100,5,B000MRA58S,"For the sixth and final film of his legendary boxing series, writer/director Sly Stallone brings back characters only seen some 30 years earlier.

Spider Rico (Lovell), the opponent defeated by Rocky Balboa at the start of the first story, is now punch drunk and a recipient of the ex-champ's affectionate protection. Little Marie (Hughes), the teen who insulted Rocky when he suggested she clean up her act, is this final picture's leading lady. Sly's kid brother Frank, who had singing cameos in the first three movies, appears briefly in a restaurant scene.

Archive footage vividly depicts several ghosts from Rocky's past: his beloved wife Adrian, manager and best friend Mickey Goldmill, and ring opponents Ivan Drago and Clubber Lang. Conspicuously missing is Apollo Creed, although Rock reminisces about their epic first bout.

SYNOPSIS--
In this emotionally moving last chapter, Adrian's dead, Rocky lives only for the past. At 55, he has bouts of melancholy over her loss. Paulie (Young), Spider Rico (Lovell) and trainer Tony (Burton) are all that remain of the old days. Even the ice rink where Adrian and Rocky had their first date is rubble.

A computer simulation of Rocky fighting current champ Mason 'the Line' Dixon (light heavyweight champ Tarver) revives interest in the old slugger. Somehow, undefeated Dixon convinces Rocky to meet him in Las Vegas for an exhibition match. In doing so, Rocky is able to put to rest forever all the old memories that have been troubling him.

2743101,4,B000MRA58S,"After recently viewing ""Rocky Balboa,"" I will cut right to the chase: Sylvester Stallone impressed me with this movie.  Having seen more than a few of his truly awful, non-""Rocky"" movies over the past three decades, this is not something I will say lightly.  It's true that Mr. Stallone squeezed the life's blood out of the ""Rocky"" franchise in the five films from 1976 to 1990.  Solid, melodramatic plots about how hope, hard work, and raw determination can make seemingly impossible dreams happen gave way to crowd pleasing, music video training montages preceding the victorious Rocky's climactic knockout punch of his latest gimmicky challenger.  At last, Sylvester Stallone vindicates the ""Rocky"" franchise (16 years after the disappointing ""Rocky V"") by resurrecting the Italian Stallion for a final shot at glory and to hopefully bring some closure to his broken heart.

It is now a far different Philadelphia in 2006, as a widowed Rocky appears utterly lost without his beloved wife, Adrian, who died five years before of cancer.  This is by far Stallone's best and most sincere acting performance in decades portraying a now-sixtyish, mentally sluggish Rocky as a small South Philly restaurateur who welcomes old friends and foes with equal grace (i.e. ""Spider"" Rico from film I).  Enter an old acquaintance, Little Marie (also from film I), and her teenage son, Steps, who join Rocky's world as new friends and surrogate family to help fill the void while Rocky's adult son, Robert (Rocky Jr.), struggles with his dad's fame overshadowing his fragile new career in the corporate world. Then, there is his cranky brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young), who is working again at the meat packing plant and remains Rocky's kindred spirit.  Despite limited screen time, Young's performance as usual is top-notch, as Paulie's presence poignantly helps link viewers to the original film's humble origins.

Meanwhile, undefeated (and un-respected) World Heavyweight Champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fuming over losing an ESPN virtual reality ""what if"" match to the ""Italian Stallion"" in his prime.  Much like Apollo Creed before him, Dixon eventually realizes that a showdown with Balboa is the likely antidote to salvage his professional image.  Conveniently enough, an increasingly restless Balboa gradually decides that he has at least one more fight left in him (essentially, sparring matches with local club fighters).  The dejected Rocky's confrontation scene with the Pennsylvania State Boxing Commission is nothing short of superb in reiterating the steep odds Rocky must now face once he accepts Dixon's challenge.

The subsequent (but far too short) training build-up to the big PPV 10-round exhibition match in Las Vegas is pure ""Rocky"" formula.  In another echo to the franchise's former glory days, actor Tony Burton returns as Rocky's coach, Duke, but his presence is sadly underdeveloped.  Although only seen in a few flashbacks, Talia Shire's absence surprisingly is an asset, as Rocky's slow, heartbreaking transition of moving into old age alone is treated with respect and character-driven depth.  Stallone sincerely conveys why Adrian will always be Rocky's guiding light, even as he finally accepts that his life must still go on (as seen in the film's uplifting final frames).  As for the franchise's new characters, the acting ensemble sufficiently holds its own against the noticeable absence of Shire, Carl Weathers, and the late Burgess Meredith.

Finally, for me, the best sequence comes early, as a melancholic Rocky wistfully drives an impatient Paulie on another annual tour of the South Philly locales where Rocky courted Adrian during film I.  It is a heavy dose of effective maudlin by contrasting Rocky & Adrian's touching early romance with Rocky's (and Paulie's) bleak present-day reality.  Add in Bill Conti's classic, touching score and the ghostly soft filter lense shots of a dark, rainy modern Philadelphia to this sequence, and one will honestly believe that Stallone is capable of making true movie magic once more.

My Score: 8/10.  This poignant film is simply fantastic in most respects by expertly combining signature Rocky elements (the original score, the Philly locales, a sincere homage to the early films) with glossy 21st Century cinematography.  The script's eventually tiresome putdowns by multiple characters about Rocky's advancing age are perhaps the film's worst offense.

P.S.  The special features include a satisfactory, alternate ending (among the available deleted scenes), which demonstrates that Stallone made the right call for the fight's plausible outcome in the theatrical release.",1299456000,,4670,5.373113854595336
2743102,4,B000MRA58S,"I watched this on TV the other night, and now I want to purchase it so I can watch it without a million commercial interruptions.
I think Milo Ventimiglia did a good job playing Rocky Jr; it's believable that he would be somewhat resentful of his Dad because he feels if he achieves anything, it's because his last name is Balboa and not because he did anything to earn his place in the world. Rocky sets him straight on that in the most stern yet loving way, and father and son are reunited.
At first I feared there was going to be a romance between Rocky and Little Marie, but two things happened that told me it wasn't going to happen, at least in this film: Rocky comes right out and tells Marie ""She's gone, but she's not gone, you know?"" speaking of Adrian. And when Marie comes to his hotel room before the fight, it's to give him a picture of Adrian to inspire him. She wouldn't bring a picture of the dead wife if she was hoping for anything else to happen. And I agree with a couple other reviewers: the best part was the end, when Rocky gathers his family around him before the score is read and says ""Let's go"". He doesn't care if he won or lost. He proved something to himself,and he's finally able to let go.

The obstacles are substantial - even if you take the ""how in the world can anyone be expected to buy a man Stallone's age as able to hold his own against the heavyweight champ?"" issue out of the equation.  Does the audience even care about this guy any more?  Can Talia Shire's absence be compensated for?  Will Rocky's relationship with his son be even remotely plausible?  Can the bombast that is Bill Conti's score, not to mention the tunes penned by Sly's brother Frank Stallone, be endured for another hour and 42 minutes?  It really is amazing that, with so much seemingly working against it, this film is a pleasure to watch.  Yes, it walks the same well-worn road every other ""Rocky"" film has, both literally and figuratively.  Yes, there's no way to replace Burgess Meredith, and his absence has been felt keenly since ""Rocky III.""  But Rocky and his son seem believable, his burgeoning relationship with Little Marie feels real (and she's no young cookie, thankfully), and the climactic fight is emotionally satisfying in that ""Rocky"" way - you know, that ""man, I wish real heavyweight fights were this much fun to watch!"" way.  They throw more punches in one round than most heavyweight fights see in 15.  Yes, there are problems; the reigning heavyweight champ is very two-dimensional (and would never be as universally hated as he is portrayed, regardless of his demeanor - lots of people love to cheer for self-absorbed thugs), the commentary by Jim Lampley and others is chock full of cliches, and it's all just so predictable.  But, in spite of all that, I really enjoyed watching it - simply because Stallone has created an imminently likeable character in Rocky Balboa, one you can't help but care about and cheer for.  Let's hope what Rocky says to Paulie at the end is true, though - let's hope the beast that is the ""Rocky"" franchise is out of Stallone's system.

Rocky III, IV, and V were only  for commercial purpose and as such lost the spirit of the original two.  Now with Rocky Balboa we can enjoy one last time the original character and story.  I now view the Rocky franchise as a trilogy of Rocky I,II and Rocky Balboa/III.
On the whole a well written and touching story about life and the pains of this world.  We not only sympathize with the title character, but all other minor roles.  His son trying to make it on his own, the single insecure mother, Pauly and his guilt, and Mason the champion.  This movie has it all. Good job!!!",1254614400,,678,4.291338582677166

This final episode is basically a sentimental recapturing of a sorts of the original Rocky film.  He's now clearly ""WAY"" past his prime and it's tough to even look at him frankly.  As another reviewer very correctly stated no boxing commission anywhere would sanction such a fight (exhibition or not).  However, in true overcome-all-odds fashion Rocky somehow makes it happen.  I won't give away the results of the match because frankly the official results are unimportant and not what he's after.  He's after validation just one more time.  Validation that he still matters . . . that the fire that still burns within him means something.  Adrian believed in him and he now needs to believe in himself just one last time.  Is it a great film?  Nope.  However, it's a warm sentimental film of remembrance not only of his journey and saga but of particular meaning to many of us baby boomer's who are aging and would like just one more moment in the sun before we head off to the rocking chair.  Rocky's ""rock"" was Adrian and he pays beautiful and appropriate tribute to her as the one person who did believe in him unconditionally.  The moral is to never give up and believe in yourself regardless of age or who says you can't do something.  Thanks Mr. Stallone for making this final film.

Folks, when I first heard that Stallone was doing yet another ""Rocky"" sequel, my first response was, ""He's GOT to be kidding, right???""  I just couldn't believe it, and I thought that it was a sure sign that Stallone's career really was over.  I was certainly sad to think that, because I've always been a big fan.

This is one of those very rare occasions that I was well and truly wrong about something.  This is a very good film, and deserves to be given credit as being what it is:  The best of the ""Rocky"" sequels.

And there is no heavyweight champ--no matter how lousy his reputation is--that would agree to get into the ring with a fighter of six decades, exhibition or no exhibition.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get past the obvious before suspending my disbelief while watching ROCKY BALBOA, the final (we think) installment of the dearly beloved Rocky franchise.

(Had this fight been sanctioned in some foreign country that wouldn't object to the massive risk involved--say the Philippines, or one of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula--the plot would have been more believable, but I digress.)

Sylvester Stallone returns in the role he was born to play, only now he's sixty, a lonely widower, and has a son (Milo Ventimiglia) who resents living under his father's famous shadow.  Rocky, while pining away at his wife's grave, realizes he still has a burning rage inside him that must be exorcised--and only a boxing match will do the trick.  Because the video games (or whatever they're called these days) have him actually beating the current reigning champ, Mason Dixon (great fighting name, played by a stoic Antonio Tarner), why not have life imitate. . .recreation?  And the rest is standard Rocky fare, from the training music to the raw eggs.  The fight. . .um, yeah, okay.

Sly is Sly, hair color or no hair color, yet this time he is curiously articulate and able to wax philosophical at the drop of a hat.  I kind of liked that.  Burt Young must be tired of playing a drunken idiot.  And the fight. . .um, yeah, okay.  But what raised the reviewing stakes of ROCKY BALBOA in the eyes of this reviewer from two to three stars was the film's ending, which was an impressive tribute to Rocky the movie icon.

Apollo Creed was cocky but a good bad guy and Mr. T was just fantastic, great attitude, memorable quotes and believable character. In this one Mason 'The Line' Dixon is arrogant but I don't think to the point of abnoxiousness. Not enough of an error to take this film down a star or two.

Rocky's retired from boxing and running a little Italian restaurant where he gives fellow former boxers free meals and entertains the customers with stories from his days as the champ. But Adrian's dead, and Rocky's living in the past, and their son is tired of living in his famous father's shadow.

The current champ, Mason Dixon, is suffering from a bad reputation. He's had nothing but knockouts, so boxing fans are complaining that he's only taking easy fights and that he's not a ""real"" champ.

A computer simulation fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon that shows Rocky winning brings everything to a head. Rocky wants one last fight, and Mason Dixon's promoters want an exhibition match between the two to shore up Mason Dixon's reputation.

2743192,2,B000MRA58S,"Everything that made the best ""Rocky"" movies (""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"") blissfully entertaining appears conspicuously absent in Sylvester Stallone's new movie ""Rocky Balboa"" (** out of ****), reputedly the last Harri for the ""Rocky"" character. Chiefly, ""Rocky Balboa"" lacks spontaneity and surprises. Indeed, actor/athletic Sylvester Stallone looks--for a man in his sixties--like he could go the distance in the ring, but writer/director Sylvester Stallone virtually recycles the original without anything that made it Academy Awarding material. In ""Rocky,"" Stallone created a charming Brando-esquire misfit, surrounded by other larger-than-life misfits, who slugged his way to the top of the American dream. Each sequel eroded the title character's charisma, and you knew that ""Rocky"" could never go down for the count. Worse, Stallone's trademark aphoristic dialogue yields few quotable lines. Another element woefully amiss is a solid villain. A third of what made ""Rocky,"" ""Rocky III,"" and ""Rocky IV"" engaging on a visceral level were the opponents. Carl Weathers established the baseline for Rocky's rivals in the first two ""Rocky"" movies, while a pugnacious Mr. T raised the bar in ""Rocky III"" and Goliath-like Dolph Lundgren took it one punch further in ""Rocky IV."" Not surprisingly, ""Rocky Balboa"" should take the bad taste of ""Rocky V"" out of the mouth of ""Rocky"" fans. ""Rocky V"" featured the least intimidating contender of the series. Unfortunately, as much as ""Rocky Balboa"" surpasses ""Rocky V,"" Rocky's latest adversary is bland to his boxers. Mason Dixon emerges as more vulnerable than vicious. You won't care if Rocky beats him to a pulp, gets beaten to a pulp himself, or they fight to a draw in ""Rocky Balboa."" This painfully predictable punching bag of clichs never generates the blood, sweat, and cheers of the original.

Anybody who remembers the forgettable ""Rocky V"" knows that the doctors warned Rocky that if he ever climbed back into the ring that he could possibly die from one blow to the brain. In ""Rocky Balboa,"" Rocky's physical ailments never impair his potential. Aside from a brief bout with the Pennsylvania boxing commission, Rocky obtains a license to box again. During the first hour of the action, our world-weary hero revisits his past on a sight-seeing trip to his old stomping grounds where he grew up and met his wife Adrian. Adrian has followed in the footsteps of more memorable ""Rocky"" characters, such as Apollo Creed and actor Burgess Meredith's Mickey Goldmill. We learn in ""Rocky Balboa"" that Adrian died from cancer back in the 1990s, and Rocky supports himself with a Philadelphia restaurant named after her. He recounts his pugilistic exploits for the entertainment of his customers. Meanwhile, in the ring, the latest heavyweight boxing champ Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) finds himself tangled up in the ropes of his own troubles. After 30 knock-out fights, the undefeated Dixon cannot find anybody to go toe-to-toe with who can match his merciless barrage of blows. Worse, just about everybody in the fight game hates him. Sure, Dixon sounds like a terrific adversary, but Stallone gives Tarver nothing to do or say that makes his character remotely dangerous. He never attains the flamboyance of the egotistical Apollo Creed in the first three ""Rocky"" epics. He doesn't present a challenge like the sadistic Clubber Lang in ""Rocky III."" Physically, he is no match for towering Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV."" Instead, Mason Dixie emerges more as misunderstood than merciless.

During his tour of his old neighborhood, Rocky runs into a local girl from his past. Marie (as played by the original ""Marie"" Geraldine Hughes) told him to bug off in the original when he offered her advice about her friends. Marie and Rocky get friendly this time around and the ex-champ shows an interest in her fatherless son. Unfortunately, the romance between Marie and Rocky ignites no sparks because the chemistry between them is wrong. At the same time, Rocky's own son Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia who plays Peter Petrelli on the NBC/SCI-FI Channel TV show ""Heroes"") has his own selfish issues. Rocky overshadows him. At one point, Rocky confides in his boorish brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young of ""The Killer Elite"") that he still has his own unresolved issues. Paulie thinks Rocky has lost his mind when he proposes to put the gloves back on for one more bout. The inevitable fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon occurs as a result of an ESPN computer generated boxing match that prompts Mason's managers to approach Rocky about a match. Mason Dixie derides it as a publicity stunt, but Rocky sees it as a place in the sun. ""Rocky Balboa"" boasts too much soul and not enough heart. Cue ""Rocky"" composer Bill Conti to bring on the music from the original as Rocky jogs around Philadelphia in his sweats training.

Sylvester Stallone looks more muscle-bound than ever, but he does not have the underdog charisma of the best ""Rocky"" movies. Clearly, Stallone has gone into the ring one time too often. The Rocky character has never looked so out of place and his actions do little to endear him. Stallone's worst mistake in ""Rocky Balboa"" was sacrificing Adrian from his screenplay than his obnoxious, cigar-chomping brother-in-law Paulie. The first hour of the new ""Rocky"" drags and the last forty minutes doesn't make up for it. Stallone stages the boxing match without flair. Amazingly, the hand-held photography doesn't add energy to the fight. Despite some moments that remain too far and few between, ""Rocky Balboa"" has no clout to flout.",1225756800,3,5630,5.1240478781284

It's too bad that Adrian was dead. Rocky and Paulie got in an arguement over Rocky's memories of love with Adrian. Rocky manages a restaurant call Adrian's. There's a sports cast comparing Rocky to the current champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The movie basically gives a reason why the two should fight and the movie ends with a happy ending. Rocky tells the champ "" It's not over until it's over."" It's fun watching Rocky train and this time he lifts weights heavier than I've ever seen him lift before.

2743194,5,B000MRA58S,"What exactly is age, aside from a number?

For far too long, I have read so many endless attacks against Harrison Ford and Sylvester Stallone simply because they both dared to revisit characters they immortalized in the 1980s. I will never again lend a second's credence to such shameless nitpicking. Sylvester Stallone may very well be a sixty year old man, but he pulled off ""Rocky Balboa"" in a profoundly moving and realistic manner and subsequently transformed this prior skeptic into a BIG-TIME believer. This, far and beyond any reasonable contention, is the true and respectful swan song the ""Rocky"" saga has long deserved.

Wisely ignoring the unsightly plot points that were introduced in ""Rocky V,"" this more recent story unfolds with a highly publicized ""virtual boxing"" match that pits the long-retired Rocky against current heavyweight titleholder Mason Dixon. When Rocky scores the duke in this particular fantasy bout, Dixon retaliates by challenging Balboa to a one-on-one publicly televised 10-round exhibition. Everybody, including Rocky's own son, steadfastly dismisses the idea. But Rocky, who has always ever worked best when the odds were stacked against him, agrees to face Dixon. What ensues, amidst the rudimentary training regimen we've all seen Rocky endure throughout the five previous films, is a staggeringly heartfelt and engaging character study that very nearly rivals that which was introduced in John Avildsen's groundbreaking 1976 original.

Among the most notable are some admittedly touching moments with Rocky and Paulie as they revisit the Italian Stallion's love for Adrian who, as many prior reviewers here have already noted, is no longer part of the narrative fold. These scenes, along with a certain pep-talk Rocky gives his defiantly selfish son at the film's halfway mark, really helped sell the story's realism. Stallone made me genuinely feel for these people, a feat that I and many others had previously doubted he was capable of achieving. His screenplay very literally came out of left field and opened my eyes to the plain and simple fact that he still has what it takes. There was not a single point throughout the entire film where I was deliberately thinking about his age. A person's age, as I've already alluded to, should never be a consideration. You're as young as you feel and, if you happen to be in the phenomenal shape Stallone is in for a man of his years, I say more power to ya'!

There really isn't anything more to be said. ""Rocky Balboa"" is a more than worthy addition to this extraordinary series of motion pictures.

This movie really surprised me with the amount of emotional scenes.  More emotion than the older Rocky films, which is amazing.  This is what REALLY made the movie shine in a light that made the entire thing worth watching over and over.

The emotions obviously lead up to one heck of a fantastic boxing match at the end.  Who wins the fight?  Doesn't matter, and you'll see why at the end.  What a great way to end an interesting series, that's all I'll say about the ending.

Another thing that surprised me was the way the entire movie had a creepy, quiet tone that pretty much stayed like that until the training for the main boxing match at the end.  That tone really helped keep my interest in the storyline, so a job WELL done.

Another cool thing is how the storyline leads you believe Rocky is too old to ever fight again, and then you see a completely different person when the time comes for Rocky to fight.  Awesome.

2743196,3,B000MRA58S,"Maybe it's because I was a little kid when the first Rocky came out but they do it for me for some reason. Most of them. Rocky 5 was awful. As I sit here I can't remember if I ever saw the entire movie. I think I always bailed out of it before it was over. I never thought that one was worthy of being the last Rocky movie so it was nice that this one came out. Whether it's because I feel like I know the core characters from all those times seeing the movies as a kid or not, they still have a way of getting to me.

I didn't read about the movie, didn't talk with anyone about it, didn't look into it at all until I first saw it on HBO or Showtime or whoever aired it a couple months ago. Since #5 was so bad I didn't rush into this one. I have been happily surprised. The first (and one of the hardest) punch of the movie is seeing the name on the headstone. I had no idea Adrian was dead in this one before that moment, and no
intention of mentioning her death in my review but after 20 seconds on this page I saw it has been mentioned tons of times already so I don't think I'm letting a secret out.

Adrian was always such a cutie pie sweety, and she was also sort of the Edith Bunker of the Rocky films. In many ways she was the strength and conscience. All the things that some reviewers have considered to be the slow, depressing stuff before the movie (aka the boxing) begins is the stuff I love. There's genuine feeling there. It's a drag that Talia Shire didn't get to be in this one but much of the movie is a fitting tribute to the strength of the character she brought to life. I like that.

Also, this Rocky most imitates real life. There's no villain to conquer and there's no ascension to, nor fall from greatness. It's a story about the people, places and memories that make a life.

My gripe about the movie is the training montage. Donning the same grey sweatshirt/sweatpants from the first movie, punching the meat, etc... was too obvious for me. I don't like things to be so blatant. Also, my favorite passage of the famous Rocky musics is only touched on for one small part as the credits are rolling. That was a bummer.

Still, what really matters in this one is that Rocky has always been a good guy and he even delivers a street-corner speech that the USA could and should really take to heart.

I understand the main motivation for Rocky to get back into the ring is Adrian's death (thus the necessity to have her written out of the story so that there's actually a point to even having a 6th movie) but at this point, I feel that Stallone similarly already went down this road with Mickey and Apollo and because of that, there's not much of anything new being done here plot-wise. The difference here though is the entire film is heartwrenchingly sad and depressing all the way to the very end. If Stallone's goal was to choke people up throughout the course of the film, he certainly succeeded. But, for as much as Rocky loses in his life (watches Mickey die, sees Apollo get killed, loses his fortune, etc.) would it have been so wrong to have the story of Rocky be put to rest with him for once winning outside of the ring (ie. life) and be able to live out his later years with the 1 thing he presumably loves more than boxing? And I know, this goes back to the argument that it was necessary for Adrian to be gone for this film to even be made. Which is why I would have preferred it not have been. Or, at the very least, have taken another angle. Simply put, its too unsettling of a way to close out the saga.

Another major gripe I had with the film was Rocky's foe, Mason Dixon, was incredibly undeveloped to the point that I almost didn't even care about the boxing match itself. So much of the movie focuses on Rocky dealing with his grief, that there's no time for boxing to be the focus save for a few scenes.

The few positives I could find out of the film mostly included the nostalgia of it. Stallone did a good job of tying in a lot of stuff from the past films. The acting is solid and Paulie was entertaining as usual. But, between the lackluster build-up of Rocky's match with Dixon and the tremendously depressing story, the ending is far too unsettling for me and in my opinion, didn't really redeem anything from the fifth film. When Stallone knew that the only solid vehicle he could come up with to push out a sixth installment was to write out yet another main character (which now adds up to being a major plot point in 1/2 of all the Rocky movies), he should have known there wasn't much left to say and to just let it be. Or, to have thought this one out a little harder.",1220572800,12,2511,4.227083333333334
2743228,4,B000MRA58S,I bought this movie because I was hoping it would compete with Rocky 1-4.  I was hoping for the best but expecting another Rocky 5.  Turns out this was a pleasant surprise.  The only dislike I had was the relationship Rocky had with Little Marie and her Son.  Rocky seems to have taken a liking to the son but yet the relationship was not explored.  The fight scenes were great the dialouge was lacking. This Rocky did not leave a segway for a 6th movie but what a way to finish an epic adventure that the Rocky's have given us all.,1220313600,,532,4.227722772277228
2743229,5,B000MRA58S,"I was impressed by Rocky Balboa. Excellent storyline about Rocky facing his inner demons.

""Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you!

-Rocky.

So this movie... is not too bad, actually. Rocky is an old dog now, still got some good mileage left, but clearly he has taken his hits, and then some. In fact he seems to be pretty much done, his glory days long since past. But of coarse we know he's got some fight left in him and watching him pull himself up by his boots straps like the all American hero is, get back into shape and get into that ring one last time(?) you may actually feel respect for this character and enjoy the film. The greatest moment comes when his son shows up and Rocky delievers a truly inspired speech that serves as the message of the film. Stallone made a decent film and heartfelt send-off for Rocky.",1219622400,,1466,4.140350877192983

""Rocky Balboa"" goes a long way towards re-establishing Stallone's credibility for the better.

""Rocky Balboa"" is a well done, feel good sixth chapter, redeeming the sometimes absurdity of the later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B0006GAOGS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;films. Rocky is an older man, he's lost his Adriane but named his restaurant after her, has a son who hates living in a shadow. (Weird irony - years ago when Weird Al did a Rocky parody song to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eye-of-The-Tiger/dp/B000ICM5IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eye of The Tiger,</a>&nbsp;he sang about Rocky opening a deli.)

Rocky befriends Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son as an antidote to his loneliness, but is far too honorable to move beyond just helping her out. Showing the arrogant champ that the must important muscle being a real champ has is his heart. Proving to glib cynical sportscasters that age is just a number. The movie is very predictable, refuses to play into a maudlin ending, and - most importantly - absolves Stallone from the last few years of sleepwalking through his 90's movies.

Interesting note - the filming in Philadelphia had already wrapped when a snowstorm hit that day, and the opportunity for more dramatic settings had arrived. The crew quickly grabbed a camera and filmed an impromptu re-shoot of the street-running scenes, ending with Rocky charging up the steps of the Art Museum in the driven snow.",1217376000,,2437,6.633228840125392

2743234,4,B000MRA58S,"Growing up, the classic series of Rocky boxing films use to be a piece of Americana. After a sixteen year sabbatical from Rocky V in 1990, the latest film, Rocky Balboa, was released last Christmas to theatres. Rocky Balboa is played by Sylvester Stallone, and the film takes place well over a decade since Rocky V and a few years after Rocky's wife, Adrian passes away.

Rocky is having trouble living life after boxing; he cannot connect with his son, and is still coming to terms that his wife is gone. That all changes when ESPN has a computer generated fight predicting Rocky Balboa defeating the current reigning champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (played by retired boxer, Antonio Tarver). This motivates Rocky to get back to the ring and make a George Foreman-esque comeback for the ages.

Sylvester Stallone is a natural as Rocky Balboa. He plays the role as perfectly as he did decades ago. The storytelling is done remarkably well compared to previous Rocky movies. Stallone directed this too, and he did a wonderful job with the narrative transitioning Rocky on the verge of a nervous breakdown to coming around by finding new friends and family to making his comeback to the ring. Admittedly, it is pretty formula, but if you have seen past Rocky films than you know they are not known for breaking new grounds, but more on delivering feel good moments. Rocky Balboa accomplishes this in spades.

The DVD itself is nicely put together. The film transferred very smoothly and looks great even on my standard definition television. I was expecting a double disc special edition release, but Rocky Balboa has basic packaging, and a decent offering of extras. The three documentaries provide an insightful look behind the scenes of the film, and on the choreography of the fights. There are also some interesting deleted scenes that help explain some miniscule gaps in the film, and an alternate, more feel good ending. Finally Sly himself provides commentary for the film.

If you're a fan of sports films, or have seen any of the older Rocky flicks than you got to get Rocky Balboa on DVD. I got a feeling this one may see a special edition release sometime down the road, but it still has a good amount of extra features to make it worth your while.

2743235,4,B000MRA58S,"I went into watching this thinking it would be pure, implausible corn, but I was strangely surprised at how good this film was.  Surprising, too, was how similar this film was in feel and spirit to the original Rocky film.  Fascinating too is that this film, of all the Rocky films, seems to have the LEAST actual focus on boxing.  The film is all about character development, relationships, and longing for the past.  Some great material being told here.
I loved seeing Rocky's continuous obsession with the past, complimented with Bill Conti's music again (the graveyard sequences were especially poignant.)
Also interesting was how the ""Little Marie"" relationship was handled.  I have to admit I was squirming contemplating a love story unfolding, and thankfully, Rocky's relationship never veers beyond that of a caring father (even at the hotel, pre-fight, when Marie visits Rocky's room, and Rocky is wearing the white-undershirt, I'm thinking... oh, no... please no.  And indeed, nothing happened.  Thank you, Sylvester Stallone, for leaving romance out of this one.)
The final fight unfolded convincingly, although in the back of my mind, I love the idea of Rocky dying from the fight and being reunited with Adrianne, but that might have ended the film on a note of corniness.  And as it stands, the film, and the Rocky series, ended with class.",1214265600,,1354,5.040358744394619
2743236,4,B000MRA58S,"When I first heard this movie was going to be made, I groaned in agony.  But then a good friend of mine stated, `I think he still has something to say'.  And you know what?  He actually did.

Don't get me wrong, I knew Stallone had talent.  After all, he scribed all the Rocky movies (the first won an Oscar), and directed 2, 3 and 4.  Leaving the fifth to the director of the original.  I can't blame him for wanting to make one more movie (lets hope it's only one more) after the travesty of the fifth movie.  Something was definitely lost in the translation.  This is a beloved character for him and he obviously wanted to set things right.

Rocky Balboa is most certainly a return to the roots of the original movie and character.  Where a man overcomes all negative odds with heart and belief in himself.  Stallone takes the reigns and makes sure this movie came out the way it should.  An aged Rocky is now suffering the loss of  Adrian, a distant relationship with his son and just getting older.  Everything in his town is changing and even though he seems to be taking it all in stride, there are moments where he is obviously having trouble dealing with it all.

When a computer generated `Fantasy Fight' is broadcast on ESPN pitting Rocky (in his prime) against the current champ Mason Dixon, the buzz turns into full blown demand for an actual fight.  The plot is pretty predictable from that point on, the inevitable is going to happen and Rocky ends up in the ring.  But you still find yourself rooting for him with everything you can, even though the guy he's fighting isn't someone you want to hate like the last three movies.

After a decade of flopping mediocre movies that he got paid WAAAYYY too much money for (Assassins, The Specialist, Driven) Stallone has been humbled, and seems to be trying to get some dignity back.  He has done that with Rocky Balboa, bringing some class back to an American underdog character that has become an icon of our culture.",1214179200,2,1978,4.487394957983193

Stallone and Rocky have been tremendous inspirations in my life. They helped me get into shape once, in the 1980's. And I'll likely use this inspiration once again, in my 50's, to get back into shape.

My first reaction to the news of another Rocky movie was ""What the heck?! Is he going to be in a wheel chair?!"" I waited till I could buy the DVD at a local store for a good price.

The movie was ok.. I think they did all the right things, considering the star's advanced age, etc.

I am somewhat crestfallen to read that Sylvester Stallone has resorted to using Human Growth Hormone in order to be in shape for the Rocky and Rambo movies.

That is just another indication that Stallone is too old to play those characters any more.

My advice to Stallone: retire those characters. Concentrate on what you can do with your body, naturally.

Hopefully you've earned enough from your previous career that you can retire in reasonable comfort.",1209859200,,1023,4.5271739130434785
2743261,5,B000MRA58S,"Sylvester Stallone has always been underrated by many, but his characterizations of Rocky Balboa and John Rambo will outlive him and the rest of us. Sure, there were failures in the series, but the originals were classic.

  With ""Rocky Balboa"", Stallone acknowledges saying goodbye to the character he created thirty years earlier. And it is a fine, heart-tugging send off. I doubt, though, that it will work for anyone who hasn't seen the original ""Rocky"", because the main movie figures so prominently.

  Rocky is long past his prime. His beloved Adrian died of ""woman's cancer"" a few years ago and Rocky pines for her every day. Stallone's script is particularly touching in this regard as Rocky visits the cemetery where he has a folding chair stashed, so he can sit and visit graveside with Adrian. Pauly, Adrian's obnoxious brother, is still around, obnoxiously played by Burt Young who seems born to the role.

  Rocky's life is empty. Yes, he has what appears to be a successful restaurant, named ""Adrian's"", where like many sports celebrities before him, he regales patrons with stories of his glory days. His son, unconvincingly portrayed by someone whose name I've forgotten, is embarassed by his father's fame and is trying to just make his own way in the business world.  Rocky visits the old neighborhood and is dismayed to see that things are changing, decaying really, getting old just like the Rock.

  Rocky finds a shy romantic interest in the grown-up girl who sassed him in the first ""Rocky"".

  But the real story involves Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the reigning heavyweight champion who has an image problem: people think that he has acheived his title not because of his boxing skills, but because his slick promoters line up weak opponents. A local sports show has an ongoing debate over whether Rocky in his prime could have beaten Mason Dixon. Yes, they say and they have a computerized animation to prove it.

  This sparks the idea of an ""exhibition"" match between the young Dixon and the aging Rocky. The spectacle of 60 year old Rocky Balboa training to fight the youthful Dixon becomes the meat of the movie and is, frankly, moving, recalling the original ""Rocky"". (Seeing the againg Stallone's over-muscled physique, however, borders on the grotesque.)

  The culmination is the fight between the two - and it is beautifully choreographed.

  In the end, ""Rocky Balboa"" echos all the human qualities that made the original ""Rocky"" so appealing. The battle of the underdog doesn't lose its appeal, especially in Stallone's very talented hands.

I really didn't expect this one to be all that good and mainly got it because (1) our son and his fiance live in Philly where it's filmed and (2) for nostalgic purposes.

We were pleasantly surprised!  Stallone is looking a little worse for wear, but he carries off the part of Rocky very well.  As he says, ""he still has a little junk in the basement.""  Against his son's wishes, he decides to come out of retirement and get his license to box.  His timing happens to coincide with a video match between him at his prime and a young boxer who has never really been challenged.  That young boxer's promoter asks Rocky to do an exhibition match....it's not supposed to be real.  But Rocky being Rocky, he trains for real and ends up fighting a legitimate fight against the ""young gun.""  Both walk away better off for the match.  And, of course, we get to hear the Rocky theme music!

The film keeps your attention, including one part where the sort-of love interest in his life asks him why he's being so kind to her and her son (who were abandoned by the father)....she says, ""you don't owe us anything.  Why are you being so nice?"" and He responds, ""Why you got to owe somebody to get something?""  Typical Rocky.

If you liked the earlier Rocky films, I think you'll like this one.  It may not be an Oscar winner, but there are some funny parts, some philisophical parts and some good entertainment.  Definitely worth watching!",1207612800,,1544,4.3992932862190814

Fast forward 30 years to when this nobody has become a somebody, and now is sliding back into to used to be a somebody.  This is where we find Rocky.  Old, retired, frustrated at what was, what is, and what could have been.

The scene where Rocky tells Paulie of the beast within now that Adrian has gone, and his need to let it out is pure glory.  We all have only so many days in our lives to get out that which lies within, before our breathe is stilled.

One last shot, not at glory, not at winning, not at taking the prize..., but one last shot at knowing what it truly means to still feel something, to be alive, and to know that it isn't over until it's over..., that is what Rocky Balboa is all about.

2743309,4,B000MRA58S,After the disaster that was Rocky V I was little skeptical about seeing this movie but I'd seen all of the others and needed closure.  Some Rocky sequels are better than others. I think it's fitting to save the best for last.  This is a good film on its own. You could really watch the first Rocky and this one and be completely satisfied. Although you'd miss out on Mr. T and Carl Weathers in their glory days.  You can sense that Rocky Balboa was a very personal and emotional film for Stallone and he gives Rocky all the respect he deserves.  Be careful loyal fans.  This sequel might even make you cry.  But not for the same reason Rocky V did. Go see this film even if you missed the other sequels. Farewell Rocky.  We're going to miss you.,1203984000,2,745,4.2785714285714285

2743312,5,B000MRA58S,"When Rocky started spinning off sequels I lost count of which ones I saw, but Rocky Balboa is a different story, and a fitting conclusion to the saga. What makes this one different is the soul of the story that seems nearer to the original film than any of the numbered serials. In a fantasy matchup, pundits predict how the current heavyweight champion would fare against the has-been Rocky. On a level playing field, the two would be well-matched. When Rocky entertains the idea of getting back into the ring, he contends with himself, more than everything else. Who is he doing it for? What is he trying to prove? Why does it matter?

What emerges is a touching story of man's triumph of self-respect. Stallone brings depth to a character who wants to carve out a legacy for himself, while coming to terms with the hopes, disapointments, and dreams of  a lifetime. DVD includes outtakes and an alternate ending that works, but you realize the one they chose is fitting and gives resonance to a well-told conclusion to the Rocky saga.",1202688000,,1036,4.686813186813187

My husband has seen all of them and received this one for Christmas.  Yes, it is typical Stallone writing and takes a while to get to the point.

2743316,5,B000MRA58S,"Despite an extraordinarely successful career, Stallone still has the fire in his belly to push himself beyond ordinary limits. He cleaned and overhead pressed over 300 pounds and that is not easy at his age. Or any age for that matter. The filming was good and the characters very human and credible. Especially Stallone's, considering the whole series is admittedly based on fiction. The fighting was real and Stallone clearly got himself back into very good shape.
I had no intention of seeing this movie because I figured the obvious. That Stallone must be banking on cashing in a few bucks with die hard Rocky fans. Then I read some reviews and decided to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.
I enjoyed the specials section as much as the movie. Stallone explained the background, logic and filming behind many of the scenes. Absent his noteable stage presence, his voice is pretty easy to listen to. He also seems quite thoughtful, intelligent, and down to earth when explaining the movie. Basically I got two movies for the price of one. But then I have grown more fond of thinking and less fond of action in my middle age.
Stallone has been such a great talent through the decades. Too bad so much was squandered on overly simplistic movies. A choice he seemed to almost deliberately make. I have read that he chose Cobra over Beverly Hills Cop? C'mon. Cobra is almost a cult classic but any film savvy person would see the very limited appeal (personally I'm the guy who has seen it four times).

2743347,4,B000MRA58S,"When this film was announced over a year ago, the chuckles and jokes(If I had a nickel for every friggin' time someone said ""what, is he gonna fight in a wheelchair?"", I'd buy a yacht) began.  After all, the Rocky series was being poked fun at back at #4.  Stallone was obviously well aware of how people would react to the concept of another Rocky film on the surface, and wrote his script accordingly.  The people in the film feel the same way about Rocky as the folks in the real world who laughed the movie off.  It is great screenwriting on Stallone's part and made people and critics think twice about the movie.  This turned out to be a damn good movie, and most folks agree.  The movie is done as if Parts 3, 4, and 5 didn't exist.  You could almost look at it as the true Rocky 3.  There are really no references to the other films, at least none that would make a difference.  It seems as though Stallone wanted to really get back to the roots of the story and get back in touch with the character.  Over the course of the sequels(parts 3 and 4 specifically), he seemed to have lost touch with the character a bit.  As Rocky became more famous and wealthy, he also suddenly spoke more intelligently(he pretty much spoke the way Stallone did in all of his 80s action films), and became a bit more high brow.  Rocky's always been a lovable, generous guy with a big heart, but a little punchy and loopy, and in this film Rocky seems to have his personality back.  On the other hand, you can still assume the events of the sequels happened as well, coz there really is nothing to contradict that they happened.  Here we see Rocky living alone, wandering the neighborhood, wondering what happened to everything he loved.  His wife, Adrian has passed on and he simply can't get over it.  His son sees him more as a bother than anything and only seems to talk to him out of necessity.  Even the folks who all once glorified him as a hero just seem to regard him with little enthusiasm.  He's just a relic in the sports world.  It's all kinda depressing actually, especially a sequence where he drags his brother in-law, Paulie, along with him to revisit locations where he and Adrian used to frequent, while he reminisces about their times together.  He also owns a restaurant and that seems to be the only joy he has.  He does befriend a woman(the girl on the street corner he gives a pep talk to in the original Rocky film) and her son, and they become good friends.  Not romantic, but the potential is there.  When a computer generated fight putting Rocky(in the prime of his career) against the current world champion shows Rocky kicking the champ's butt, opportunity knocks.  The champ(Antonio Tarver, who had to beef up to play a heavyweight fighter) doesn't like the embarrassment.  He also has personal demons of his own.  His managers and the boxing promoters see this as a goldmine opportunity and soon they're knocking on Rocky's door.  Rocky's been bored for so long and has nothing to lose, so he decides to do it.  What the hell, right?  Plus, Rocky sees it as a way to feel like somebody again whether he wins or loses, as long as he goes the distance, does his best, and can prove to everybody that he's not some old fogey that is just gonna get knocked on his butt in the second round.  In a way, it's alot like the first film in that regard, that he really has nothing to lose and is doing it more to prove something to himself rather than everyone else.  The fight is visually probably the best and most realistic of the series with the first few minutes looking as though you're actually watching a Pay Per View bout.  Pretty cool.  How does it turn out?  Watch it!  Stallone definitely scored a knockout with this one.  Very good.",1196899200,4,3754,4.429197080291971
2743348,5,B000MRA58S,"I knewI would like the last installment in the Rocky franchise, but Rocky Balboa was even better than expected.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Rocky Balboa is about sixty.  He owns a popular Italian restaurant.  Despite his Philly icon status, he lives a quiet, humble life, driving an old van and keeping a folding chair in a tree by Adrian's grave.  Honoring Adrian, he has never married and has no girlfriend.  Their son, in a corporate job, avoids his awkward attempts at fathering. To top it all off Rocky is facing his last fight, with a much younger opponent.  Why is he doing it?  ""There's a beast in me,"" he sadly tells Paulie.

The movie has a great message, is tender, and you root for and relate to the Italian Stallion all the way.  Highly recommended.",1193702400,2,766,4.525547445255475
2743349,5,B000MRA58S,"When Stallone announced he would be making the sixth installment in the ROCKY series, a lot of people shook he head.  After all, he was 60 years old at the time of filming, well past his prime.  And, given how bad ROCKY V was, a lot of people, there was a good possibility this was going to be a pretty bad movie.

Well, like the new Indiana Jones film currently in production (KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, where the hell did Lucas and Speilburg get that title?), ROCKY BALBOA does not try to hide the main protagonists' age.  Balboa is old, and he knows it.

Before we get into the film proper, there are several deleted scenes included on the DVD, as well as an alternate ending in which the outcome of the final fight with Mason Dixon is reversed.

Stallone, Burt Young (Paulie), and the guy who plays Duke are the only actors to be in all six films.  Five different actors have portrayed Rocky's son, one for each movie except the firt.

The film opens to Rocky feeding some turtles, a reference to the first film.  As the first hour or so unrolls, we find out that Adrian has died, Rocky has opened a restaurant in Philadelphia, Spider Rico from the first movie has become Christian, and Maria, also from the first movie, has struck up a friendship with Rocky.  Other than the fight, these are the main storylines that Stallone focuses on for the majority of the film.

Two of the best scenes, not only in this movie but in the series in general, is when Rocky goes before the Boxing Committee to get licensed.  The state committee refuses to give Rocky a license, and Rocky launches into a speech about his freedom and the Bill of Rights and how he needs to do what he needs to do.  The other has to do with his son, as his son feels like he is living in the shadow of his father.  Rocky quickly sets his son straight.  Great monologues.  And it's great to see Maria from the first film back again.  She had a scene in ROCKY V (Rocky's warning that she'd be a whore if she kept up her lifestyle turns out to be true prophecy) but it was cut, leaving Rocky to bring her back for BALBOA.

The film is openly nostalgic, with Rocky revisiting his old haunts, though the old places have changed, and a lot of times for the worst.  Unlike ROCKY V, however, this nostalgia is tempered with Rocky's heart, his optimism, and his winning attitude.  He's also having some relational issues with his son, but ultimately these are resolved by the end of the film.

BALBOA references all five previous films (though appropriately enough there's only one throw away reference to ROCKY V).  There's footage of his fights, and the film heavily references the first ROCKY.  Even Burgess Merideth, who died in 1997 and played Mickey, gets a line in one of the retrospective sequences.

Unfortunately, Carl Weathers does not appear in archive footage, as he wanted to be actually written into the movie (probably a dream sequence, something along those lines), and since Stallone wouldn't do that Weathers wouldn't let him use any footage with Apollo Creed, which is sad, given how important a character Apollo is to the Rocky movies.

Though long retired, a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight Mason ""The Line"" Dixon sparks interested in the aging Balboa when the computer marks Balboa as the winner.  Mason Dixon's promoters is looking for some new blood, because Dixon has been fighting chumps and has lost audience favor to the point where all of his proposed pay-per-view matches are being declined.  Dixon's promoters are looking at this as a way to remake Dixon's image, and see this match as a perfect way to do so.

Still, Balboa is a lot older now, so when Duke (yes, that Duke, the Duke in all five previous films) starts training him, a lot of the techniques are out do to his advanced age.  As Duke says, ""Let's build some hurtin' bombs,"" and these bombs they certainly build.  Despite the age, Balboa trains hard.  Stallone even incorporates a revision to the famous scene of him running up and down the Art Museum steps.  In the original film Rocky was to run the steps holding a dog, but this did not prove feasible as Stallone found the dog they had too hard to manage.  This time around they got the scene to work as originally envisioned.  Of course, we have the famous Rocky theme playing in the background as he trains.

Then Rocky and Mason Dixon fight.  This fight without a doubt is the best choreographed and filmed of all the Rocky fights.  It's also the most realistic.  For being 60 years old, Stallone is in remarkable condition.  Guess steroids will do that too you.

Mike Tyson also makes a cameo during the fight.  Strangely enough, like Reeses Pieces in ET, there's a few shots of product placement during the fight for GoldenPalace.com.

SPOILTER: The fight ends just like the first ROCKY, a split decision with the win going to Mason Dixon.  Even though Rocky loses, he doesn't because he manages to go all ten rounds, and gives Dixon a run for his money.

Stallone stuck with the ending in the film to pay homage to the first film, as well as making a point that Rocky still walks away victorious, even if he doesn't ""win"" parsay.  In fact, Rocky's out the door while the announcement is being announced, cause it doesn't matter whether he wins or loses, because he's already won something much bigger.

Another important theme is that Mason Dixon is looking for a real fight, and Mason Dixon wants to respect himself, and so they both come out winners. END SPOLIER.

ROCKY BALBOA is a great way for Stallone to end the series, and probably is the second best film in the entire franchise, behind the original.  We get to see Rocky the way we've always wanted too - a winner, a picture of the American Dream fully realised.  Sure, he's had some hard knocks, he lost Adrian, but he's still a fighter.  Still has that indomitable spirit about him.

The film ends with Rocky placing a flower on Adrian's grave, and with his signature line still fresh after all these years, Stallone says ""Yo Adrian, we did it,"" and then walks away with the film going out of focus.

Then the credits roll.  Even the credits give you that warm fuzzy feeling, for it has footage of different, ordinary people all running up the steps of the art museum.  Makes you just smile watching it.

And all I can say to that is bravo.  Stallone, out of all odds, managed not only to write a good end to the Rocky franchise, but wrote the best film since the original.  Given how bad ROCKY V is, this fact's even more miraculous.

Yeah Rocky, you really did do it.  Though we won't get to see you again, this is truly a great closure to remember you by.  You really are an American Icon.",1193270400,4,6699,4.524126455906822

The boxing is amazing. I felt like I was watching a real fight.

2743353,4,B000MRA58S,"I have to confess, I could not be more surprised by the quality of this movie. After a very disappointing Rocky V, I decided that I was just going to watch this final film for the sake of completeness, but I expected it to be a bad, or at best a neutral, experience. To my surprise, the end of the saga is really good, with a nicely built story, and a movie which provides the whole journey with an elegant symmetry.

Adrian has died, victim to cancer, and Rocky owns a restaurant that is successful only by virtue of the fame of its owner. Patrons visit the establishment looking for a first-hand story, or a picture, or an autograph. Meanwhile, Rocky's son is trying to make it in the corporate world, but is having a tough time dealing with being a celebrity's son. This in turn puts a strain in the relationship with his father that takes a big toll on Rocky. When a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight champion and the old hero takes place on Sportscenter, with a controversial result, the door opens for the return of the people's champion.

I am extremely glad I was wrong about this film, since this provides a classy ending to one of the best collection of sports movies of all time. Stallone delivers a much better performance than I expected after watching him being a guest in Monday Night Football. He has some restrictions in terms of facial expressions, but this does works well with the character, and he provides the needed level of passion and energy. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Robert Jr., also adds to the quality of this movie, since he is right on target with his performance, portraying the inner conflicts of his character masterfully. The final fight might not be the best we have seen in this series of movies, but it is definitely adequate.

Anyone that has been following the Rocky movies needs to watch this final installment. And please, if you were discouraged by the dreadful Rocky V, do not be afraid, this new movie will definitely make it up to you.",1191024000,3,2006,4.582172701949861

Once again, the character of Rocky has stirred the hearts of many in this final segment with his kindness, his endurance and his courage. I love the closing scenes when the credits are shown. As comical as it may seem to some, it captures the essence of the movie and how it has inspired many to overcome difficult obstacles. The character of Rocky is truly an American  phenomenon, and this final film is a more than suitable memorial and tribute to it.",1189987200,2,721,4.5038167938931295
2743355,5,B000MRA58S,"Wow, this was not what I was expecting!

The story was a lot slower than any Rocky film since the first one in the mid '70s, but I'm not complaining. When it was all over, I thought this was probably the best-made Rocky film of them all. I never thought I would describe a Rocky movie as ""classy,"" but this one deserves that adjective. It may be the least entertaining, as far as a lot of action goes, but it is the most classy.

I say this mainly for the wonderful, sweet tone to this story: a story of aging boxer who is long past his glory and is still mourning the loss of his wife. (Apparently ""Adrian"" died some time after the last Rocky film.) His wife's death is haunting him, which makes this a very sad film in the first 45 minutes. However, interspersed in Rocky's reflective period is the still the same upbeat, look-at-the-positive side-of-people attitude. It's obvious Rock still loves people. With that attitude, it's impossible to dislike the man.

For those who might be leery about watching yet another Rocky movie filled with over-the- top villains and way overdone ring action, rest easy: you won't see that here. Balboa's training scenes last only a few minutes and the fight doesn't begin until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. Preceding that are melodramatic moments with Rocky's friends, family, and new female friend and her son.....all handled with dignity and class.

The cinematography is just beautiful in parts and if you're a student of photography, you'll enjoy viewing this.

Only around ten minute of boxing scenes, but for sure very captivating. In particular I like the motivational core message much. Twice from Rocky's mouth to win his son back on the street and to get himself up during the game, ""It aint about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward.""  In short, recommended!",1188432000,4,731,4.496240601503759

The Bill Conti score is there, the turtles Cuff and Link, Maria from the old neighborhood, Paulie and his irrascible ways. Rocky now runs a restaurant in Philly named Adrian's, whose death he is still mourning, he's lost connection with his son who is trying to escape the shadow of his famous dad. Rocky's future is stuck with his past as his life consists of regaling customers with old fight stories. When he decides that he needs to fight again because ""he still has stuff in the basement"".

If I were to buy the series this one and V would definitely be left out.

What was wrong with this movie is not the plot but the deliverance.  I felt no threat to Rocky like I did with Apollo, Mr. T, and Drago.  To me this movie was selling products; HBO, Tarver, etc.  It didn't have that same charm as the movies did.  You really couldn't root for Rocky because there was nothing for him to win or lose.  The main fight was an exhibition fight.  He didn't win any money, nor did he win a title.  Yes you could say he did it for himself, but, so what.  I was hoping he would've fought a fight that would bring him back on top, monitarily and he would be able to better his life.  I know it wasn't about the money, but the way it ended, just wasn't fulfilling.

I can safely say the movie does not contain any of those things.  It does contain an inspirational story that continues the tradition of the earlier films while containing enough new twists to avoid becoming a pale imitation of them.

The story works on so many levels - it has all the action, but is more introspective of human life.  I think it is partly about reflecting on the events of the earlier films and forming a complete picture of a life, like the final volume of an epic.  I do not think it can be appreciated without viewing the first three movies, or at least the first two.

Rocky doesn't care about politics. He cares about people. Really the only film in the series that is an absolute embarrassment is Rocky IV, with the Rambo-ish cold war overtones. Even Rocky V tried to get back to basics, and suffered with trying to have it both ways, Rocky losing everything, yet still feeling ""comfortable.""

Rocky Balboa gets it right. I miss Adrian, but it's the right choice to pound home the point that Rocky has LOST something. Stallone finds the heart of the character and story again, where your greatest challenge is yourself. Mason Dixon isn't presented as a villian, but as a young man who's lost his way as well.

With all its flaws, I actually found this movie to be quite entertaining. The first half I was really thinking that there was no way he would actually fight. He looks like he was spit out from a wood-chipper. I was wondering where all his money has gone, or did he simply enjoy living in his old stomping grounds. His restaurant looked like it was somewhat profitable. What I disliked most about the movie was the halucinogenic fight scene. What's with all that back and forth, black and white, jerky, grainy special effects? The fight scenes in the earlier movies were much easier to watch.",1186185600,,750,4.514705882352941

Stallone really makes you feel for and root for Rocky the whole way through.  To see all the crap he's been through physically, emotionally, etc...  really gets you feeling for the Rock.

And by the end you get this feeling that both you and Rocky and going through the same emotions.  That connection that Stallone makes with the audience is rare in this day of film, and he does it so well that this may be his crowing achievement.

2743422,4,B000MRA58S,"Thankfully, they didn't decide to name this movie Rocky VI, so we can forget that the fifth one ever happened.  This unexpectedly good followup (but hopefully finale) to the Rocky saga is a real treat.

In the first two Rocky movies we had the real story.  A rags to riches fighter dealing with family and money and fame.  Sure it's simple and plays like a soap opera, but it's the simplicity of it all that's great.  The fighting was about dignity and pride.

Rocky three, while perhaps the most fun of the franchise, can't be taken as seriously.  Pitting Hulk Hogan and Mr T. against Rocky was entertaining, but pretty much just fluff.  And Rocky IV was way too cheesy for me.

With Rocky Balboa, you can forget all the pro wrestlers and the Russian steroid driven He-Men.  The soul is back.  Here we have Rocky dealing with his dead wife, his relationship with his son and making corny but heartful motivational speeches to his loved ones around him.  Surprisingly, it all works really well.  Even before the actual fight takes place, or is even proposed, it's hard not to be sucked up into Rocky's story of hardship in Philidelphia.

The fight that takes place is between the old retired champ and a cocky young fighter, Dixon, who wants to use the match to gain popularity.  Dixon encourages Rocky to keep the fight simple so he can lose with dignity, but of course Rocky has none of it.  Here he is out to shed the demons of his past and prove to himself one last time that it was all worthwhile.

Overall, this movie was really good; a great last harrah for the frachnise.  Did this movie need to be made?  Probably not, but with a bitter taste left in our mouths from V, it's good to have a real finale to this saga.  The fight itself was good, but a little by the numbers and not as gritty or edge of your seat as we've seen from previous outtings, which really is the only reason for the missing star.

I have watched it over 8 times and I am just amazed by it and cannot believe it did not get the attention it deserved.  I guess the only saving grace is that for the most part, critics understood the movie, and had a soft spot in their heart for it.  Movies are to entertain but to some directors/actors, the goal is to make a difference, to make a point.  The way Rocky handled himself through the movie, through the depths of despair, while also facing the reality of his own aging, Rocky shows us how to rise above it all ""The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows"" he says, ""It's a very mean and nasty place... and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently, if you let it. Not you, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... it's about how much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits. And not pointing fingers saying: ""You ain't what you wanna be because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!""

What's nice about this film is that Rocky finally seems mortal...now a widower, he lives alone in the same Philadelphia neighborhood where he started, and he owns a successful restaurent called ""Adrians"". Although he is still popular, it is more subdued and respectful now; we no longer have enthusiastic crowds following him around, but rather individual people paying their respects. His son Robert is living and working on his own, and although he loves his father he can't help but feel resentful of the fact that most people see him only as Rocky's son and not as his own man. Rocky also develops a friendship with a woman named Marie, the same ""little Marie"" that he walked home in the first film. What's nice about their relationship is that it's not romantic in nature; rather, each one has a void in their lives that they help each other to fill. What's also touching is that Rocky still cares for Adrian even though she's gone, as he regularly visits her grave and also makes an annual visit to all the places that remind him of her, such as his old apartment, the pet shop where she used to work and the ice skating rink (now torn down) where they went on their first date. It is during this moments, which are combined with black-and-white flashback scenes, that we really get a sense of Rocky's mortality, as he sadly looks at the old sign of Mickey's gym and says to Paulie ""The sign's falling apart"" to which Paulie replies ""Everything's falling apart!"" (Paulie, by the way, has hardly changed a bit).

What's especially refreshing in this film is that we get to see the other side of a Rocky opponent. In this case it is Mason Dixon, excellently played by Antonio Tarver. Dixon is struggling with the fact that even though he is the champ, people hate him because he wins his fights too easily. Like Rocky, he also takes a step back into his past when he ditches his high-priced training team for his old trainer Martin, with the obvious reference here to Mickey.

The training sequence for this film pays homage to the first three films, complete with ""Gonna Fly Now"" and Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia art musuem. The fight at the end is another classic, as we see Rocky trying to do the same thing he did in the first film; go the distance with the champ. Stallone and Tarver put on an excellent bout, complete with the HBO pay-per-view broadcast team that makes you feel that this really is a heavyweight fight.

Overall, this is just a great film, one that truly pays tribute to Rocky's past and ends this series on a high note. Every fan who felt that ""Rocky V"" was a sloppy and unfitting way for Rocky to go out should be more than pleased with this one.",1180051200,2,2943,4.4748603351955305

2743479,5,B000MRA58S,"For years, (strictly as a guilty pleasure, you see), I haunted my local multiplex to revel repeatedly in the serial cinematic exploits of Sylvester Stallone's most famous celluloid hero. Yes, I hereby confess that I actually enjoyed all those Rocky movies with Roman numerals in their titles. I even sort-of liked Rocky V (1990), the one that all the film critics mock.

But that's because I'm not a ""film critic,"" you see; I'm a movie enthusiast. Although I'm nominally Roman Catholic, my true religion is that uniquely American art form known as motion pictures. Every Friday night that devotion draws me to the services conducted at the local mission--the Mission Drive-In Theater in San Antonio, that is--where I take communion, comprised of hot-buttered popcorn and a Coca-Cola slushy. In the lobby, posing proudly amid my pantheon of movie gods--right there with blown-up images of heroes portrayed by John Wayne, Charlton Heston, Robert Mitchum, Burt Lancaster, and Gregory Peck--stands Sylvester Stallone's enduring creation: the quintessential American underdog, Rocky Balboa.

For more than thirty years, Stallone has never been given his proper due as a screenwriter. Recently, for the first time in over a decade, I watched a DVD of his original, low-budget sleeper, Rocky (1976). I was struck all over again by the masterpiece of understated, eloquent drama that Stallone and director John G. Avildsen had put up on the screen. The tale of the small-time pugilist and loan shark's enforcer with the soft spot in his heart, who gets his miracle shot at the heavyweight boxing championship on America's Bicentennial, Rocky became the unlikely winner of the 1976 Academy Award for Best Picture--and an instant classic.

To a great extent, Rocky worked so well because of its indelibly memorable supporting cast. There was Talia Shire as Adrian, the painfully shy pet shop cashier and the object of Rocky's affections. There was legendary character actor Burgess Meredith in the role of his lifetime as Mickey, Rocky's elderly, cantankerous trainer, whose fatherly devotion inspired the lowly club fighter to believe in himself. There was Burt Young as drunken leech Paulie, Adrian's bullying brother. Here were people taken from Stallone's own tough childhood in South Philly, made even more real through brutally honest dialogue and poignant situations. But no matter how lowly or bad, they and all the other characters in the film--even the loan shark (played by Joe Spinell)--got caught up in Rocky's quest and ultimately redeemed themselves. Their lines and gestures were so simply, beautifully, economically imparted that, at times, they seemed to rise to poetry.

In one scene, Rocky visits the boxing gymnasium to ask Mickey why he's been running him down for so many years. Mickey snorts back at his protg, ""Ya don't wanna know!"" When Rocky presses him, the old man unleashes all the fury he can still muster:

""Okay, I'm gonna tell ya! You had the talent to become a good fighter, but instead of that, you become a leg-breaker to some cheap, second-rate loan shark!""

""It's a living,"" Rocky mumbles.

""It's a waste of life!"" Mickey roars back.

Along with other memorable scenes, that one--with the pain and anguish on Burgess Meredith's face revealing his heartbreak over the younger boxer's unfulfilled promise--could easily have been scripted by such dramatic luminaries as Budd Shulberg, Paddy Chayefsky, or Rod Serling.

The film has left its enduring stamp on the culture. The steep flight of steps that rises up to the Philadelphia Museum of Art has become one of the most-visited attractions in the city. There, tourists re-create Rocky's ascent during his famous training scene, pumping their own fists in imitation upon reaching the summit. These rituals are a testament to an iconic character that millions worldwide regard as the embodiment of their highest aspirations and deepest dreams. Rocky Balboa reminds them that within them lives the power to make their own dreams real--if they only put as much heart into pursuing their goals as he did when he stepped into the ring against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), giving everything he had and more.

Sadly, the Rocky series is generally held in low critical esteem, largely because of subsequent inferior installments. Although Rocky II (1979) was an excellent sequel (after losing a split decision in the first movie, Rocky finally won the title from Creed in the second), the following two films (1982 and 1985) pitted Rocky against flamboyant, cartoonishly indomitable opponents (played by the scowling Mr. T and the stone-silent Dolph Lundgren, respectively). Fun stuff, but nothing to rival the first two. The fifth film (1990) was a complete letdown, a tired, anticlimactic outing about Rocky Balboa in retirement, down on his luck and dealing with the challenges of fatherhood.

Sixteen years after that fizzle, were you expecting yet another Rocky? I certainly wasn't. But happily, Stallone has returned to first principles. Avoiding the predictable Roman numeral ""VI"" and simply using the lead character's name as its title, Rocky Balboa focuses once again on the essence of its protagonist, regarding him as a man first, and a boxer second.

The movie takes its place with several other film series that recently have gone back to basics and started to take their heroes seriously: Batman Begins (2005), last year's Superman Returns, and the new film of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale. Unlike those blockbusters, though, this picture doesn't try to recapture its early magic by casting a younger man in the hero's role: instead, it audaciously asks the viewer to take seriously the prospect of a man pushing sixty, yet becoming a contender for the heavyweight championship of the world.

It opens with Rocky visiting the grave of his dead wife Adrian (Talia Shire once again, in flashbacks). She died of ""woman cancer,"" as the Rock describes it. Every year on their anniversary, he takes a sentimental journey through the old neighborhood, visiting landmarks from their first meeting and dates, dragging the insufferable Paulie in tow. As he reminisces, you see that her absence has broken his heart. Yet Adrian remains omnipresent throughout the movie, as the spirit that moves him on.

Visiting an old watering hole, he runs across a girl from the neighborhood, Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a single mom trying to raise a teenaged son and make ends meet by tending bar. A comely lass with the map of Ireland twinkling in her eyes, she and Rocky clumsily, tentatively, spark a relationship. Rocky meanwhile becomes a mentor to her son (James Francis Kelly III), keeping him on the straight-and-narrow.

Otherwise, the former champ leads a predictable, comfortable life running an Italian restaurant, greeting and regaling patrons with old stories of past bouts and glories. His whiny twentysomething son, Robert (Milo Ventimiglia), complains about living in Rocky's shadow while he tries to make it in the business world. Rocky gives him the kind of speech fathers stopped giving their boys a couple generations ago, but should resume giving:

The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows! It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't how hard you hit; it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward. How much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that!""

He schools his son to have some pride in himself. ""I stopped thinking about what other people thought a long time ago. . . . The only respect that matters in this world is self-respect.""

One night on ESPN, a panel of sportscasters debate who was the greater boxer--current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (played by real-life light-heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver, stepping up in class), or the former two-time champion, Rocky. In an on-air computerized video simulation, Rocky KOs Dixon. This wounds the champ's pride: he's gotten to the top by defeating a bunch of has-beens and fall guys, never facing a real challenger for his championship belt.

""All of boxing is hoping for a warrior who can thrill us with his passion,"" a ringside announcer carps as Dixon defeats another chump. Desperate for respect, his handlers pitch the idea of a pay-per-view exhibition fight in Las Vegas between their man and the legend who hasn't been in the fight game for twenty-one years.

After a few awkward moments mid-movie, there's The Rest . . . and, well, you can pretty much guess the rest. Our Rocky begins training hard, old-school style. Once again he pounds his fists against bloody slabs of meat in the cooler; he lifts barbells; he does one-arm pushups; he plows through the Philly's snowbound streets and sprints to his rightful place atop those famous Steps. ""Gonna fly now!""

The film culminates with the inevitable fight between Rocky and Dixon. Since Rocky is too old and stiff to bob and weave, his corner man, Duke (Tony Burton), counsels: ""So, every time you hit him, you got to make a dent. . . . So what we'll be calling on is good old-fashioned blunt force trauma. Horsepower. Heavy duty, cast-iron, pile-driving punches that will have to hurt so much it'll rattle his ancestors. Every time you hit him with a shot, it's got to feel like he tried kissing the express train.""

Cinematographer J. Clark Mathis's camera frames the fight scenes tight, and they come fast and furious, like watching Goya's Segundo de Mayo spring to life. Rocky may be old and weathered, but he's still solid as the hull of a battleship. Composer Bill Conti's martial score, built around his famous trumpet fanfare from the original, got my pulse pounding once more, and before I knew it, it was 1976 all over again, and I was rooting for the Italian Stallion. There was Rocky Balboa standing toe-to-toe with the heavyweight champion of the world and giving him a run for his money.

Sixteen years after the debacle of Rocky V, we've got a Rocky movie that believes in itself once again. Though it may not match the first in originality and drama, in heart and soul Rocky Balboa lives up to its tagline: ""It ain't over 'til it's over.""

Sadly, the Rocky franchise is over, at last, but the old warrior is going out on his own terms.

I respect the film more every time I see it, and I thought I'd write something about it and send it along.  Rocky Balboa reminds me a lot of Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of my favorite films of all time.  It's about one man overcoming his own sense of nostalgia, the negativity all around him, the false authority of bureaucracy, and finally finding peace within himself.  The film depicts Rocky running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the snow, much as Kurosawa used the weather, and specifically a snow scene, to depict the moment when his main character finally gets in touch with himself in the present.  I wonder how much of an influence Ikiru was on the film?  Rocky Balboa is truly a masterpiece film, both for its screenplay and execution on film.

2743481,5,B000MRA58S,"In Sylvester Stallone's latest and, potentially greatest, take on his seminal hero Rocky Balboa, the writer/director/actor scores big in the emotional clenches. These are the final moments of a great character so many people have come to know and love.

When I heard about the film getting green-lit with Sylvester Stallone in the starring role, I have to own up to some skepticism. I really didn't think Stallone could pull it off. I thought maybe he wouldn't have the chops physically or possibly be too emotionally close to the character and the lucrative franchise it became to take enough risks with the character.

Twenty minutes into the film, though, I was convinced that I was in for a comfortable, exciting, and emotional reunion and final meeting with a hero that's been in my life for thirty years. I saw Rocky when it came out. He and Burt Reynolds were the reasons I drove Trans Ams for ten years. Burt had Sally Field back then and jeans looked great on her, so maybe Burt had a little more influence.

Rocky's personal life has always been a series of tragedies. He was a bum from nowhere who got a shot in Rocky. He almost lost the woman of his dreams in Rocky II. He lost his trainer, Mickey, who was like a father to him in Rocky III. He lost one of his greatest friends, Apollo Creed, in Rocky IV. And in Rocky V, he lost everything and got kicked to the curb back in his old neighborhood while getting betrayed by a young boxer he was trying to help.

And in Rocky Balboa, he's lost Adrian. Knowing the character for as long as I did, I had to wonder what was left. His life appears comfortable, but it's empty. The tour he takes us on during those opening minutes of the film bear this out. His relationship with his son has gone south. More than anything, though, Rocky just doesn't know what to do with himself. When Adrian was alive, he could give up the fighting. He had her. Now he no longer has her and all he has is that restless drive to be inside a ring matched up against an opponent.

Stallone pays loving tribute to his character and graciously gives the fans a great story. It's not art. It's not always polished. What you've got here, folks, is myth, the stuff of good dreams. That's been enough for people since they first gathered around campfires to swap stories.",1179273600,3,2302,4.4714285714285715

Rocky Balboa proved to be my second favourite of all the films (Rocky IV being the best).  It opens with Rocky running his wife's restaurant Adrian's after her death from cancer, the customers attracted by hearing his reminiscences about past glory.

Of course Rocky isn't satisfied with the quiet life and when the opportunity arises to box again he grabs it with both hands.

The film is well acted and even though Sylvester Stallone is in his sixties he puts in a convincing performance as the veteran boxer.  If you enjoyed the earlier Rocky films you'll love this one.",1178928000,,773,4.492857142857143

2743548,4,B000MRA58S,"Rocky Balboa is a surprisingly good and touching movie and is very reminiscent of the original Rocky film from 1976. Though many may argue this is a just another predictable Rocky movie, I feel that Stallone has redeemed himself here and has made a fitting farewell to his most famous and enduring character.

In my opinion the acting, writing and directing are all top notch, and this film is so much more realistic than the last two Rocky movies. Stallone looks much older in this film and he's quite believable as an aging ""has been"" former champ.

This film is arguably one of the best in the series and it's my personal second favorite after the classic orginal. Rocky is part of American pop culture now and this film is a wonderful ending to this series. If you're not a Rocky fan to begin with, it would be pointless for you to even watch this movie. But if you are a fan, you won't be disappointed.

PS to Mr. Stallone: Please end the Rocky series here on this very high note and don't be tempted to make yet another Rocky sequel!

2743577,5,B000MRA58S,"When this movie first came out, my son begged me to see it, but I inwardly groaned and resisted with every fiber of my being. How many Rocky incarnations are we supposed to put up with? When the DVD came out I finally relented, and you know what? I'm glad I did.

Rocky is past the prime of his life, has settled into an obviously reluctant retirement from boxing, and has lost Adrian, the woman he so dearly loved. Rocky spends a lot of time reminiscing about the past, and his life with Adrian. Cranky ole Paulie (gotta love him!) is still in the picture, but has lost patience with Rocky's inability to let go of the past. Likewise, Rocky has a strained relationship with his son, who is angry about having to live under the shadow of the Italian Stallion.

The reigning heavyweight champ is a young boxer by the name of Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. In the ring, Mason always manages to pound the competition in the first round, which has left boxing fans feeling disappointed and alienated. For fun, ESPN holds a virtual boxing match between Mason and Rocky (in his prime), and you guessed it, Rocky wins! This virtual boxing match sets off a chain of events that leads Rocky back into the ring.

Bittersweet, nostalgic, extremely touching, and of course you want Rocky to win! The boxing scenes were well-choreographed, and so action-packed they made my heart pound! I was also highly impressed by the dialogue (especially Lil' Marie's pep talk and the what-for Rocky finally gives his son), which was written by none other than Sylvester Stallone himself. ROCKY BALBOA serves to remind us that it's not whether you win or lose, but it's how you play the game. Well worthy!",1177891200,5,1673,4.626262626262626
2743578,4,B000MRA58S,"I was very reluctant to see this movie having suffered through the last two sequels.  I must say that I was surprised by this film which was actually quite good.  The film managed to recapture the feel of the original film with a now ""old"" Rocky, mourning his wife constantly while trying to mend fences with his son.  He is the owner of a restaurant and lets his old sparring partner Spider Rico eat there for free until Spider decides he needs to earn his keep and voluntarily begins working in the restaurant.

Rocky meets up with the troubled young lady who he had walked home in the first movie.  She is now a middle-aged single mom tending bar.  Rocky takes a liking to her teenaged son right away and seems to like her too but Adrian's memories keep getting in the way.

Of course what is a Rocky film without a bout?  In this one Antonio Tarver puts in an excellent performance as Mason Dixon, a champion with nobody worthy to fight.  Since there are no valid opponents for him, he cannot get a pay-per-view big money fight going.  His promoter and manager get intrigued by a computerized fight between Dixon and Rocky and feel that if they could talk both fighters into getting into the ring for real, they can have the big money fight they were looking for.

The movie does not make any pretensions like some of the other Rocky films.  Rocky's trainer tells Rocky that the only thing that he can do is train himself so that any punch he lands will put a hurting on Dixon and may teach him some humility.

The fight in itself is not bad and in the end, Dixon may become a more ""polished"" fighter with a better reputation because of it.",1177891200,2,1644,4.3861386138613865
2743579,4,B000MRA58S,"One of the pleasant surprises of 2006 is the ""come back"" of Sylvester Stallone, or Rocky Balboa, in his sixth and probably the final chapter that began back in 1976. The sixth ""Rocky"" film, or simply ""Rocky Balboa,"" turned out much better than people had expected, if not as great as the first Oscar-winning one which is now part of American movie history.

Rocky Balboa, now retired, and running a restraint, steps into the ring for the last time. It's an exhibition match against Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), current heavy weight champion whose unpopularity is part of the reasons behind the match in Las Vegas. I am afraid the story is not as plausible as it should be, not because of the age of the star or Rocky himself, (who still looks in good shape), but because even the former champion like Rocky, I think, would have to fight his way more than the film describes, before the bout against the champion. The film's script is rushed at certain places like the relations between Rocky and his son, or the training scenes before the match.

Still I liked ""Rocky Balboa"" for one reason. It is that Stallone, truly in character, delivers one of his best acting as Rocky, clearly aged, but still with dignity. The strength of the film is the character of Rocky himself, whose honesty and good-natured personality is exactly what makes this film special. There is no Adrian any more, but Stallone wisely brought back little girl Marie from the original, who is now living with her son. Geraldine Hughes is impressive as grown-up Marie, whose quiet interaction with Rocky reminds us of what he was like in the first Rocky film, where budding romance between him and Adrian played the major part of the story.

The film is not flawless. The use of archive footages from the previous Rocky films is too much for me, and sometimes the film gets too sentimental. Still I think ""Rocky Balboa"" with moving moments and inspirational messages, is winner, if it is not a knockout.",1177804800,3,1973,4.71304347826087

Rocky is back in his old hard scrabble neighborhood dealing with the facts of aging, the death of his beloved wife, and his estrangement from his son.  When a computer generated match between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon touts that Rocky was the better boxer, Dixon's management stages an exhibition match between the two boxers.  Rocky accepts despite some thinking his crazy to do so.

Rocky Balboa is true to the original movie and evokes a lot of nostalgia.  The writers did an outstanding job of living up to the theme of the original Rocky - the underdog who through heart and courage exceeds expectations.

As I watched the movie all jokes feel aside when I realized that this was the best Rocky ever! There was a depth and maturity to this movie, probably because we fans have been following the lives of these characters for over 30 years. There was almost an intimate documentary like quality to the picture. One can almost see themselves in Philly, going up to Rocky and shaking his hand. This character is that real.

When you watch this final installment, you will realize why you originally were drawn to the Rocky movies and character 30 years ago. Rocky is all about heart and the triumph of the human spirit. And he is all about being true to himself and this movie is all about being true to the fans.

But the fact is, is that when it's over, you've only been reminded and taken back to the spirit of the original film ""all over again"".

2743618,3,B000MRA58S,"This movie was not all I thought it would be. Honestly I am torn on my opinion. There were things about it I liked and things about it I disliked. Here is the lowdown on what I thought and why...

What I liked: Stallone is in AWESOME shape and is an inspiration to people young and old. A healthy lifestyle pays off and here is your proof. He still has a great body. He still looks great shirtless even at 60 years old and I respect that a lot. It's not easy to stay in that kind of shape at any age. The acting, Stallone has matured as an actor and is a lot more natural and believable than in other movies. The cinematography was nice and really captured the essence of the first Rocky movie. The HBO PPV fight LOOKED like a real boxing match! The camera angles during the fight looked very authentic. Paulie was great, I loved his line about ""People who skate on ice are stupid"" (I am not a fan of the cold either) and I think he was a valuable and funny character in this movie. Paulie added some laughs in the somber beginning. The Champ, they picked a real boxer for the part of the rival and I think the authenticity really came through, he's not a bad actor and I hope to see him in other roles in the future. It's nice to see someone who is not just an athlete but has other talents too! He did a very good job of acting like the young, self-absorbed, arrogant champion. To see him interviewed in real life, he seems like a respectful, humble guy. I think this role was a good challange for him. He actually seemed to enjoy playing an ego-inflated star who everyone hates and I think it takes a lot of character for an otherwise nice guy to play such a role.

What I disliked: The slow, sappy version of the famous ""Rocky"" music. I thought the music was a downer and really did not like hearing the formerly upbeat and inspirational theme song slowed down to the pace of a funeral dirge through most of the film! Yeah we get it, we are supposed to feel sad, depressed and it's meant to be nostalgic. It was overkill! The first half hour of the film is dedicated to showing how down in the dumps Rocky is, his wife is dead and he goes to all his old hangouts and there are too many flashbacks. The beginning dragged a lot and I almost fell asleep during the first 30 minutes. The son, a good actor who looked a lot like Stallone but the whole 'living in dad's big shadow' concept was cliche. I didn't like his character at all. I found it hard to believe that a 25-30 year old man would still have such an immature resentment of his dad. I was thinking ""Dude, get over it, grow up and give your old man a break!"" This attitude would have been more suited to the behavior of a teenager and not a grown man, though I did like Rocky's speech to his son about blaming people and making excuses. Way to go dad, I would have felt the same way if I had such a grumpy, ungrateful kid! I also thought it was unrealistic how the son suddenly was so supportive after being so distant for so long. It was painful to watch such a loving kind hearted dad being brushed off by his whiny, wimpy and disrespectful son! The girl Marie, they could have heated this part up just a little, it was too 'innocent' a relationship. Rocky's wife is dead, he's had a tough time, the guy deserves to hook up with a new lady and prove that he is indeed still the Italian Stallion! I would not have gone so far as a love scene but I found the one kissing scene was too 'vanilla' for my taste. I wasn't feeling any passion there. So, Rocky is not young anymore but he's not dead, geeze! The ending, ok so it was realistic but it was dissapointing, I much preffered the alternate ending on the DVD! I also could have done without the shot of Adrienne's grave, like we already SAW that 3 times during the film, why show it again and end a good movie on a sad note? We know she is gone, I want to see him move on with his life and stop wallowing in the past like he did for half the movie.

Overall, I liked the movie but I didn't love it. Halfway through the film I was thinking ""PLEASE lets get past the sappy parts and show him training, climbing stairs, drinking raw eggs and punching sides of beef!"" I really liked how the other Rocky movies pumped me up and made me want to go work out. This movie did not have the degree of adrenaline that I would have wanted in an action-based Stallone movie.

This movie showed a more human Rocky but it was so overdone it came off too sappy and slowed the pace of the film. There was a lot of emotion in the beginning but the end lacked emotion and fell flat. There was a big build up and it lacked a big ending to carry it. I wanted to see the tear-jerking ending where he triumphs over all odds after being beaten to a bloody pulp. The satisfaction simply wasn't there. It was a good ending to a great series but unfortunately I think this movie could have been better.

The alternate ending on the DVD was stellar and would have been a much better choice than the original. If they had gone with the alternate ending I'd have given it 4 stars. If they had done that and cut down on the sap and sad music I'd have given it 5 stars. It was WAY better than Rocky 5 but that's not saying much because Rocky 5 was a one star movie as far as I was concerned. I am looking forward to the next Rambo movie and I hope it has a better ending than Rocky Balboa. I might watch this again one day but I think I will skip the ending and watch the alternate one instead!",1176768000,3,5476,4.1283973758200565
2743619,4,B000MRA58S,"I was all set to dislike this film.  I skipped the last Rocky installment, the last one I saw being when he fought the big Russian in Rocky does Glasnost.

However, Stallone imbues his aging South Philly boxer with such a sweet nature, weathered by his boxing years and now grieving for his departed Adrian, living a humble life in the old neighborhood, proprietor of a modest but decent family restaurant, obviously still beloved despite the fact that his championship glory days nonetheless inevitably are fading, that I was reminded why a huge audience was captivated by this character o-so-many years ago.

And so Stallone hooked me in for one final inspirational saga of an aging champ trying to find meaning for his life, at the same time trying to convey a message of passion and courage to his own son and a young single mother and her son.  Of course it's incredible, but realism was never the attraction of Rocky movies.  It's always been about the inspiration and the yearning.

So if you're beyond being touched by a sentimental flick about an iconic American character, give this a pass.  Stallone was wise not to make his opponent a villainous ""bad"" guy.  And that is indicative of the movie as a whole: Stallone displays maturity in both his story, himself, and his character.  He's aged gracefully, and so has Rocky, and both have their hearts in the right place in this one.  Nicely done.",1176422400,6,1405,4.721311475409836

2743621,5,B000MRA58S,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  There is nothing undone, left out, or unfinished.  Sylvester Stallone brings back to life the heart and spirit of Rocky as no one else can do.  All the love, faith, hope, desire, and raw guts are presented in this film to stir the heart and inspire the soul for a life time.  Growing up with the Rocky films, I found this one to be particular dear to my heart and soul because, reaching middle age, this picture shakes up the indominable spirit within to remind me (us) that it ain't over till it's really over.  Sly does all his stunts and choreography in the fight scenes plus brings in some spontaneous adrenalin filled punches that has him and opponent going at it.  There is bonus features like the stuff behind the scenes including boxing sparing and Sly's weight lifting routines which would normally kill other people.  The movie makes no pretenses, and does not try to make an old guy look young like so many other movies do when they have old stars come back with their hair dyed and gut sucked in.  No, in this movie, Rocky IS Rocky, a guy in his sixties, gaunt, beat up and wracked by life's  pounding, but full of heart, courage and a rekindled fire.  This movie isn't about an old guy trying to prove himself to the world but about a fighter who rediscovers himself, revisting himself back to his roots as a fighter, and doing the only thing he knows how to do and what he was made to do- fight!  In fact, there are no villians in this movie as we see that both Rocky and his opponent, Mason Dixon (a real professional boxer by the name of Antonio Tarver) are driven and motivated for different reasons which leads them to the final battle field of the boxing ring.  Sly did it again and did it well. Great writing, great casting, great directing and acting, this is one of the best movies out there ever.

I had the same feeling I had after not watching number one for awhile and going back and seeing it. After watching the movie again on bluray and doing something ive never done before (watched all the extras)I decided I think the ending is just fine.  There is another ending of the movie that is in the extras that while it felt good it didn't leave the same depth and contentment that the movie version had.

2743623,5,B000MRA58S,"When I first heard that Sylvester Stallone was making yet another Rocky film, I laughed to myself. I couldn't conceive how the movie was going to have any credibility. After all, Stallone seemed to have lost the plot in Rocky 5 and he is now sixty years of age. I anticipated this latest installment would be something of an inadvertent comedy. However, driven by curiosity and a sentimental attachment to the early Rocky movies, I ventured down to the cinema on saturday night for a late showing. Jaded, following two consecutive twelve hour shifts, I stumbled into screen 1 barely retaining my bucket of popcorn and diet coke. I found my seat, took a deep breath and regained my composure.

The Opening scene shows current heavyweight champ Mason Dixon successfully defending his title in a one-sided no thrills affair. The commentary team discuss the current poor state of the lack-lustre heavyweight division and cry out for a meaningful Dixon title defence against a passionate challenger. The undeniably skilful Mason reigns superior but without a serious rival remains an unknown quantity in the courage department. Meanwhile Rocky is struggling to come to terms with the death of his beloved wife Adrian. She passed away years earlier but Balboa is clearly still grieving. In moving scenes he visits her grave and the old neighbourhood in Philadelphia to reminisce about the good times, pausing by old haunts which include the pet shop and Mickey's gym. Rocky, now retired from boxing runs an Italian restaurant aptly named 'Adrian's'. He entertains diners with fight tales from a bygone age and cuts a sad though charismatic figure. A tv sports network discuss how champions from differen't era's would fare against each other. They pit Balboa against current champ Dixon in a simulated computer fight. The fantasy cyber match results in Rocky winning the bout via knock-out. This gets Balboa's juices flowing and the italian stallion contemplates a low-key comeback against small scale opposition. Mason's promoters have other ideas and generate public interest in a real Dixon versus Balboa exhibition match in fight capital Las Vegas. Rocky, against the advice of his son and Paulie can't resist. Determined to prove the last thing a fighter loses is his heart and anxious to get the demons out of his system, Rocky signs the fight contract. Out comes the famous grey tracksuit as Balboa embarks on a punishing training regime.

But this movie provides far more than just a pugilistic punch. It's about life's hard knocks, relationships, death, growing old and letting go of the past. Rocky has a new woman in his life, little Marie from the old neighbourhood, played by Geraldine Hughes. In the original Rocky, Marie was a lost and abusive teenager whom Rocky tried to help. Marie, now a single mother with a child of her own is re-united with Rocky. The dialogue in this film effortlessly fluctuates from hard-hitting to humorous. A movie which is simplistic yet intelligent. Proving that a film can entertain without special effects or complicated twists in the plot. Bill Conti's musical score is inspiring as always and the casting quite magnificent. Many of us grew up with the Rocky character, he has something of an iconic status. The working class underdog who achieves the american dream against seemingly insurmountable odds. It's easy to scoff at the idea of Balboa climbing back through the ropes but it's really no more ludicrous than George Foreman and Larry Holmes staging comeback's as over-weight grandfathers. Foreman actually regained the world championship during his second time around.

Despite Balboa's age, Rocky 6 is perversely more realistic than Rocky 4 and 5. The role of Dixon is played by former light-heavyweight champion of the world Antonio Tarver. Tarver's ring credentials lend an invaluable authenticity to the film and indeed the actual bout against Rocky itself. Stallone also respectfully pays homage to the earlier films. Wonderful to once again witness Balboa running up those famous steps in Philadelphia. Also a pleasure to see Burt Young (Paulie) and Tony Burton (Duke) back on the big screen. My one criticism would be that Duke (Rocky's trainer) has too small a part in the movie. However, Sylvester Stallone has certainly done justice to the Rocky legacy with this final farewell. He can now hang up his gloves as the undisputed champion of boxing movies. 'Rocky Balboa' is a writing, directing and acting knock-out. ""Yo Adrian, we did it"".",1176076800,3,4500,5.086603518267929

Without giving away the movie, it actually kind of sets the clock back to zero as if nothing ever happened. From underdog to champion and back again, this actually felt like the real final chapter.

Don't get me wrong, nothing is lost. Rocky has been a big influence in my life since day one. You can do whatever you set your mind to. ""It's not about how well you can hit. It's all about how well you can take a hit.""",1175817600,,627,4.040322580645161
2743648,3,B000MRA58S,"This is an entertaining film that far exceeds #5 in the series but falls short of the glory days (for me particularly 2 and 3 in the series).

Rocky owns a restaraunt called Adrienne's.  His wife is dead for several years now, and Rocky, while successful and doing well, relives his past by revisiting his life with Adrienne too much.  It's unclear to me what drives Rocky back in the ring.  Is it his dissatisfaction with his current life?  It didn't seem to be the computerized boxing match with current champion Mason Dixon.  Rocky hardly gave it an afterthought.

Dixon's character was underdone.  It would've been better if he was equally disatisfied with his life as champion.  He returns to his old gym and trainer, but that aspect of the story was under-written.  I think Stallone was trying to compare old-time athletics to new generation.  It didn't quite work.

I think there should've been more animosity between Dixon and Rocky, particularly on Dixon's side.  Too much time was spent on Little Marie and her family and not enough on Dixon/Rocky and what leads them to fight.  While Little Marie was valuable to the film, it needed a little more in the way of motivation for Rocky to fight given the layoff and health risk.

Tony Duke's character was underutilized as well.  The training session was among the worst of the series.  (But at least there was one unlike Rocky 5).  The fight was very good, and saves the movie.  Although Rocky lost a split decision, it was a close call.  But then afterward there was no opportunity for the champion to say, hey Rock, you're better than me afterall.  Or at least I respect you.

Entertaining film.  3 out of 5 stars.  Good for Rocky fans especially.  A dud for Rocky haters or those who haven't seen 1 - 5.",1175817600,,1764,4.612903225806452

2743650,5,B000MRA58S,"When I first moved to Las Vegas in 1986, I lucked out and got a two-week job as an extra in the Sylvester Stallone movie, Over the Top.  The filming took place at the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel and dealt with the arm wrestling contest that Stallone's character enters so that he can win enough money to take care of his son.  I was a member of the audience in the arena.  Before Stallone would come onto the set to film a particular scene, the Assistant Director would rev the audience up by playing the theme to Rocky, ""Gonna Fly Now.""  Of course, the audience didn't really need to be revved up for Stallone.  I, and the hundreds of other people sitting in the stands, saw Stallone as his fictional character, and we would stand up and loudly cheek out of pure admiration.  To us, Stallone was Rocky.  Things haven't really changed much since that moment in time over twenty years ago.  For me, Stallone is Rocky and will always be so.  I still get a big, goofy grin on my face whenever I hear the theme to Rocky.  So for me, Rocky Balboa was a dream come true.  It was a chance to relieve the original ""Rocky"" movie and to reach a better understanding of the last thirty years of my life.  More than that, however, it gave me hope for the future.  Rocky Balboa is a true spark of life for all of us in my age bracket who are having trouble moving ahead.  This is a movie about not giving up and being able to take the hits that come your way.  It's certainly true for the character of Rocky as well as its creator, Sylvester Stallone and what he had to go through to get Rocky Balboa made.  Let me just say this.  The budget for Rocky Balboa was around twenty-four million dollars, which is extremely low for a movie in today's time.  For a film to break even, it has to make at least three times what it cost, which also covers distribution and the percentage that the theaters get from the sell of each ticket.  To date, the worldwide gross is right at $148,000,000.00.  Stallone did what was originally thought to be impossible by many others--he gave new life to Rocky and made another hit movie!

In Rocky Balboa, our lead character is now living in South Philadelphia and is struggling to recover from the lost of his wife, Adrian, who died of cancer.  His only friend appears to be Paulie (played by Burt Young), who's still working at the meatpacking plant.  Rocky and his son, Robert (played by Milo Ventimiglia), have grown apart and see very little of each other.  Though Rocky owns and operates a small Italian restaurant called Adrian's, his heart isn't into it.  He has little to look forward to and sees his life as nearly over.  The only pleasure he gets is from visiting Adrian's grave.  Everything begins to slowly change for Rocky when two important events take place.  The first is when Rocky runs into Marie (played by Geraldine Hughes), a person from his past who gives him a reason to keep going forward with his life.  The second thing that happens is when a sport's show does a virtual reality computer fight between him and the new world champion, Mason Dixon (played by Antonio Tarver), displaying that Rocky, though older, would win the bout without any problem.  This creates in Rocky the desire to want to fight again, but only on a local level.  Dixon's people view the computer fight and immediately see a way to make a great deal of money.  After Rocky renews his fighting license, he's asked to do a celebrity fight against Mason Dixon in Las Vegas with part of the proceeds going to charity.  Though hesitant at first to get back into the ring with a heavyweight champion, Rocky finally agrees to do so with Marie's encouragement.  Robert, however, is totally against his father fighting again.  He's lived in his father's shadow for years and this will only make matters worse.  Rocky explains to his son that this is something he has to do in order to feel alive again.  He also tells Robert that he has to stop blaming others for his problems and to learn to deal with life by not giving up when things gets tough.  Of course, all of this leads to the preparation for the big fight and then to the fight itself.  I still get goose bumps when Rocky runs up the steps to the Philadelphia Art Museum with ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background.

What Sylvester Stallone was able to do with Rocky Balboa is to return to the roots of the original movie in the series and tap into its heart and soul.  You see it in the streets of Philadelphia, the poignant music of Bill Conti, Rocky's old home and Mickey's gym from the first movie, the shadows and dark overtones of the film, the return of Burt Young as Paulie and Tony Burton as Duke, and the haunting presence of Adrian (played by the lovely Talia Shire) throughout the film.  Stallone put his own heart and soul into the making of this movie, fighting an up-hill battle against the studios who thought his career was over and never giving up, knowing that this film was a reflection of his own life and struggles.  Rocky Balboa is definitely the way the series needs to be ended.  It's a direct mirror of what can be good in a person's life if he's willing to put forth the effort.  I don't know about other people, but when I saw this movie in the theater last December and then again of DVD last night, it brought tears to my eyes, but in a good way.  This is the last Rocky movie.  Stallone knew that he was finally saying goodbye to his most famous character and to an intricate part of his own life.  As the final credits roll in the movie, dozens of everyday people are shown running up the famous steps of the Philadelphia Art Museum.  Each year thousands of people run up these steps and throw their arms victoriously up into the air just like Rocky.  That's how powerful the impact of this series has been on the mass public.  I used to live outside of Philadelphia during my early teens.  If I still lived there, you'd see me running up the steps, too.  Well, maybe halfway up the steps.  I'm not in as good of shape as I used to be.  But, all is not lost for us ""Rocky"" fans.  There will be a Director's Cut coming out before the end of the year.  My guess is that it will be a Two Disc Special Director's Cut Edition, which will include the twenty minutes of deleted scenes that were originally cut from the film.  That's something to look forward to.  With regards to the DVD extras on Rocky Balboa, there's a fifteen-minute featurette on the making of the movie, another fifteen-minute featurette on doing the big fight scene at the finale, twenty minutes of deleted scenes with an alternate ending, bloopers, and a great film commentary by Stallone.  This is definitely a movie that the fans of the ""Rocky"" series will love, and as the last words in the film say, ""Yo, Adrian, we did it!""",1175644800,5,6793,4.413183279742765
2743651,5,B000MRA58S,"The Rocky saga was one of my biggest sources of inspiration as a teenager. It began, ironically, with Rocky V, which I saw in the theaters, and worked my way back. I loved every aspect of the story: determination, courage, patriotism, and faith, rolled into an everyman, beaten, but not broken, uneducated, but wise.

""Rocky Balboa"" concludes the story. Rocky's back in the old neighborhood, running a restaurant named for his late wife. Adrianne's passed from the ""woman cancer."" Rocky entertains his guests with tales of his former glory days. However his nostagia hurts his current relationships, especially with Paulie, the same as he's always been, and his son Robert. Even time itself is leaving Rocky behind, as all his former haunts are torn down. Even his statue's gone.

Still, he feels a ""beast"" he can't get out, and seeks one last shot. He gets it when a computer puts him against the current champion, and has him winning. The champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, is desparate for a real challenge, and the subsequent self-respect that comes from it. So, he challenges Rocky to a special exhibition bout.

And this is where the film truly shines. Rocky's tapping into his roots: running the steps, pounding the beef slabs, drinking the eggs. He's also supported by characters from earlier movies, especially Little Marie, the girl he walked home in ""Rocky,"" and Spider Rico, his opponent from the beginning.

The fight rounds off the movie perfectly. Even the fight ends the way it should.

The movie's even a good piece of filmmaking. One thing I noticed was the light work. Especially in the beginning, the harsh overhead light gives the illusion of a flashback, which is exactly where Rocky's living.",1175644800,2,1711,4.927083333333333
2743652,4,B000MRA58S,It was better than I thought.  Yes I wish it ended in a knock out and the end happened so fast.  Like Rocky was leaving really fast just after the last few punches.  It seemed odd.  Of all the things I would have loved it if the other boxers showed up to help him train.  If Dolf showed up in the shadows and told him his posture was off and how he could not guard his face.  Also if Mr. T was there.  I was really hoping for that. ;(,1175558400,,434,3.7555555555555555
2743653,5,B000MRA58S,"I, like everybody else who heard the news of another Rocky film, shook my head and said ""what's left to say?""  Well, the early reviews came out and Sylvester Stallone did the expected promotional interviews.  What I heard wetted my appetite.  Stallone was not my favorite actor but when I saw him in a film I liked him.  After renting this film the first comment I made to my wife was, ""this is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood!""  In this, the last of the series, we see for the first time an introspective and truly pained man in conflict with his past, his present and his future.  Sylvester Stallone has crafted a real story, although stretching credibility at times, but revealing the inner thoughts and emotions of a plain average Joe.  Stallone IS Rocky Balboa!  Unlike several of the in between Rockys this one is, in my mind, the best of the series.  You needn't have seen the first five to appreciate and understand this film.  The acting throughout is first rate, the production values are great, the fighting choreography is superb and for once, he has a believable ring foe in Mason Dixon, unlike the Dolf Lundgrens and Mr. T's of the past.

Critics will continue to minimize the abilities and appeal of Sylvester Stallone but I put him in the same league as John Wayne who, depite every adversity that befell him, whether in World War II combat, fighting gunslingers in the old West or courting an Irish maiden in old Erin, never lost his moral compass and ultimately prevailed.  I would definitely nominate ROCKY BALBOA as one of the best films of 2007.",1175558400,4,1596,4.620567375886525
2743674,2,B000MRA58S,"I wasn't sure what I was watching: an adoring public saying good-bye to ex-champ Rocky Balboa, or Sylvester Stallone in an embarrassing plea for relevance or redemption. In the end, I think it was the latter. The telling clue was in Paulie's speech to Rocky before Rocky entered the ring. Paulie said (and I paraphrase), ""tonight get it out of your system once and for all"". He was referring to the stuff that Rocky said was in his ""basement"", the anger that he had in his gut. As Stallone wrote the screenplay, I think he was talking to himself. I wonder what speech he'll give as John Rambo in the upcoming ""John Rambo"" movie that's filming. (I'll never know, and I won't miss it.)

All art must pass the test of credibility and this failed. Rocky, a punch-drunk pugilist morphed into a dime store philosopher. It felt as if Stallone was reaching back for the easy dialogue of the first Rocky film - still a classic IMO. That easy dialogue was written thirty years ago, though, and this time around it didn't come easy. Stallone is a different person, and therefore a different writer. People grow; they change. Yet here he presents us with yet another Rocky film, with a main character desperate *not* to change. (We may as well be speaking of Stallone himself.) A Rocky that wants to get back into the ring, relive his glory days, get whatever he didn't get out of his gut the first time around when he lost a staggering and entirely unbelievable twenty-three fights. A Stallone desperate to...yeah, I've said that already.

The vehicle Stallone chooses as Rocky's spark is absurd. ESPN does a ""cartoon"" simulation of a fight between the current heavyweight champion (Mason ""the Line"" Dixon, played by Antonion Tarver who is a former light-heavyweight champion and has a few grand delusions of his own), and the simulation predicts that Rocky would win. In the real world, this wouldn't have raised more than an eyebrow. In Stallone's world, in whatever illogical, deranged universe he has placed Rocky in, this grew to an exhibition pay-per-view fight worth millions held in Las Vegas, where nobody goes to lose.

An exhibition PPV? Who are they kidding? I understand that this is fiction and that suspension of disbelief is expected, but this is absurd. I'm a boxing, er, fan, I suppose. A reluctant fan in that I don't enjoy the violence but do enjoy the competition. My point? I know the game, and I can state with absolute certainty that an exhibition PPV between a young, strong champion and an aging (50s!) fighter who has shown signs of brain damage in previous films would never be sanctioned. For that matter, no fight between said combatants would be sanctioned anywhere in the U.S.A.

I will give the film this: it used a real boxing promoter (Lou diBella, and also showed the production flag for De La Hoya's company, Golden Boy Promotions), real boxing commentators (all from HBO: Max Kellerman, Larry Merchant, and Jim Lampley), a real ring announcer (Michael Buffer - ""Let's get ready to rumble!""), a real referee (Joe Cortez), and the weigh-in official was the Nevada State boxing commissioner (Marc Ratner). Mike Tyson even made a punk appearance, showing up at the fight and calling out Dixon. There were others, too, such as the commentators from ESPN (Brian Kenney).

I heard that the fight choreography was going to be superb. It wasn't. The punches looked no more real than they ever have, and the beatings that each fighter took were impossibly brutal. In this film, Rocky is over fifty years old. Any referee, *especially* Joe Cortez, would have stopped the fight in the second round when the fifty-year-old contender is knocked down twice and severely wobbled several other times. Rocky still hasn't learned to keep his gloves up so he's quite literally a human punching bag. I wonder if there's a metaphor in that last sentence for Stallone.

Let's hope that Stallone is finished with Rocky. I am.",1175385600,9,3928,4.811851851851852

2743677,4,B000MRA58S,"When Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment in the series, was announced, there was almost a unanimous cry of ""ugh"" from people. Like the Terminator getting a horrible third outing or Alien which had a really lackluster fourth one, the idea that another Rocky was coming out was almost like saying another franchise was getting another unceremonious finale. Imagine people's surprise when it actually didn't suck and it was - gasp - pretty good. It's not an awesome movie though but when you think about what it is and what it could've been, it's quite an achievement.

Rocky Balboa is having a hard time dealing with the highs of his youth and constant reminders of his current lows. Make matters worse, he has a rather shaky relationship with his son Robert and his wife Adrian has passed away. He's incredibly nostalgic for the old days and he has to realize the old days are over and he's seen as part of it. In the boxing world, current heavyweight champion Mason Dixon is underappreciated and booed since he keeps beating anyone he comes across and there's no heart in his fights. When a ""what if"" computer simulated fight appears on TV, it gets people curious and Rocky and Dixon seem up for it.

But Rocky's old age and a ""has-been"" aura brought on by critics tries to deter him and while billed as an exhibition match for charity, it becomes an even bigger match for Rocky and for Dixon who wants to be appreciated by actually proving he's a good fighter since so many of his fights were rather easy. With the help of his son, Adrian's brother Paulie and Marie, now all grown up, Rocky steps into the ring and proves he can still pull off the impossible.

If there's anything that's bad about the film is that there's a little bit too self-conscious tone to the film where it knows it's an underdog story and meant to be inspirational but it kinds of pushes it. Nearly every line of dialogue Rocky says is some beat-all-obstacles tagline that they'd put on movie posters (the one they probably didn't use for the movie ends up being the cover tagline I bet). And the whole thing just feels like a big downer after all since there's so much hardship Rocky has to deal with, you're almost surprised there wasn't a scene of him jumping off a bridge. Obviously this is meant to reinforce the more inspirational aspect of the film but it feels like the film's a walking Chinese cookie dispenser.

Sylvestor Stallone I always saw as being lumped into that ""action hero"" stigma of guys who look tough and can say one liners but they can't act. In this, he's actually pretty good (though not Oscar-worthy) and if it wasn't for the aforementioned lines he says, it'd be a quite poignant performance. Milo Ventimiglia does an admirable job as his son Robert and Geraldine Hughes is also quite good as Marie who isn't really portrayed as a kind of ""Adrian Part 2"" but instead just a female friend Rocky can count on for support.

The film as a whole is kind of erratic for the most part. The pacing during its initial two-thirds is sketchy with many scenes of Rocky reminiscing and trying not to let things get to him (such as a humorous scene where a young punk girl goes after him cause he didn't buy them beer). It takes a good hour before the fight is actually officially announced and then we go into the training montage, complete with the infamous music and the museum step run although amusingly, it has a dog in it. But the big star is the fight which is a big knockdown drag-out fight between Rocky and Dixon and, shot in HBO-like format rather than the ""in the ring"" approach Raging Bull had, it's still quite a rousing scene.

I got a huge truth to spill: I never saw the original. I've seen snippets of scenes and I have seen IV but let's face it: I was 10 and I forgot most of it. So I can't really comment if this is the best Rocky since the original or a pale comparison. What it is though is a pretty good film and not the embarassment people thought it'd be, including me. Now, let's see if the Rambo sequel is the same thing.",1174953600,5,4039,4.473541383989145
2743678,5,B000MRA58S,"Yes this is a review of the 6th and final installment in the Rocky saga. Rocky has been called the greatest underdog story of all time. It has been given two thumbs up by Elbert & Roeper; it has been given rave reviews and is currently 3rd in box office holiday season sales. With all of that, why would Imprint review this movie as well? The answer to that question is how the movie is relevant to students.

Rocky Balboa is called a truly inspirational story. It is the story of a man who has had it all, lost most of it and rebuilt what he could. The film was written, directed and starred in by Sylvester Stallone. But this story is older than even that. For Stallone wrote the first Rocky story and held on to it for years. He would not sell it because no one would let him star in it. With his perseverance and determination, he held onto the script until he could play the role of Rocky.

In this film, Rocky is again the underdog. He is 53, retired, and running a restaurant. He is also widowed, and looking for something more in life. He decides to try and fight again - he is thinking something local, for charity. And yet he is given a shot at the champ.

This is a story of overcoming - the story of living your hopes and dreams. It is about believing in yourself and following those dreams. Rocky states: ""What is it you said to the kid? The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very rough, mean place... and no matter how tough you think you are, it'll always bring you to your knees and keep you there, permanently... if you let it. You or nobody ain't never gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... it's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... how much you can take, and keep moving forward. If you know what you're worth, go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit."" And he lives that in this film.

Yet Rocky is not the only character to face this adversity in this film. Paulie, his brother-in-law, who only has his work and alcohol is laid off from his job. Rocky's son Robert has lost his way, and is trying to not live in his father's shadow. And each of these three men must deal with their grief at the loss of Adrian, who was wife, sister and mother to these three men.

Rocky must also face his aging body. In the beginning of the training sequences he realizes that this will not be the simple battle of determination to get the body in shape. It will be in part mind over matter as he must reconquer and retrain his body to be that of a fighter.

Rocky's opponent Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (played by actual former heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver) does not take the fight seriously, he has the youthful disregard and disrespect for age and experience that Rocky will bring to the ring in this battle of athletes from different eras.

Rocky Balboa will motivate us to face our own challenges with perseverance and a community for support, and with hope and by prayer. The story will promote discussions about where we find our courage, what we want from life and how we can overcome loss and yet stand strong and remain faithful. It will also help us to classify what we call a victory.

Rocky is not just another boxing movie, or even just a sport movie, and it is definitely not just a squeal. It is a movie that will help you find the courage to follow your dreams and encourage you to pursue hopes.

So when the world knocks you down, you can either lay there or get up. That is what Rocky Balboa teaches us.

(First Published in Imprint 2007-01-05 as 'Final Rocky flick hits home, the heart'.)",1174953600,25,3611,4.297058823529412
2743679,4,B000MRA58S,"Rocky Balboa captures some of the drama and spirit of the first Rocky film.  With R.B., the Rocky story comes full circle.  Unlike Rocky III and IV, which were almost cartoonish, there is real emotion and drama in R.B.  The movie is entertaining and inspiring.

Some of the acting is good (Stallone, Hughes, Young) and some is lousy (Ventimiglia.)  [Note:  Why didn't Sage Stallone play Rocky's kid?]  The script is sufficient but a some of the dialog is embarrassing.  The emotional connections and Rocky's giant heart carry the film.

The biggest problem with all the Rocky movies (from II forward,) is that the boxing sequences are, on some level, ridiculous.  It's nice to suspend one's belief once in awhile for the sake of entertainment, but it's almost insulting to pretend that fighters could take the types of beatings Rocky and his opponents take in these movies.  The best boxers to ever step foot in the ring couldn't wildly throw punches and take shots to the head for 10-12 rounds.  Fights just don't work that way.  Watching a 50-some year old ""retired"" fighter go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds with the heavyweight champion of the world, a fighter in is prime, is complete and utter farce.  For me, I would have been pleased to watch a match that was more paced and deliberate, in a word: realistic.

Despite its shortcomings, it is worth watching.  If nothing else, Rocky's life lessons (never give up, believe in yourself, keep moving forward, go for your dreams) give R.B. considerable value.

2743680,3,B000MRA58S,"it was sad to see that Adrian had died. this film reflected on alot of memorys. this film was way better than Rocky 4& and way better than Rocky 5. but overall Rocky 1&2 are the standards. Rocky 3 still has the most intensity overall. but this one was cool. Rocky meets a new lady friend who has a son. Sly&Burt Young as In Laws is the film version of Michael and Archie from the tv show ""All in the Family"" that kind of Chemistry. all the trademarks are in place. Antonio Tarver does a good job on screen. in real Life He is a Very Good Champion. that  Mike Tyson cameo was funny.",1174867200,2,581,4.0964912280701755
2743681,5,B000MRA58S,"The first Rocky film had a heart and a soul that mattered to people a lot more than the fight.  Rocky was a kind man who wanted to get through life, was unhappy about being a collector for a local loan shark, and fell in love with Adrian.  The whole Apollo Creed thing fell into his lap and changed his life forever.

The spirit that made the first film a joy faded with each new film while the fighting sequences became the point of the film.  Sort of like they way the gadgets overshadowed Bond in many of the subsequent films after ""Goldfinger"".  This film is so enjoyable because it has the heart and soul of the first film and the inevitable fight (this time ostensibly an exhibition) is the right send off for the hero.

The film opens later in Rocky's life.  He has experienced the one loss he could not bear well.  Yet, he has found the grace to bear up under its tremendous weight.  Paulie is still as miserable as ever, actually even angrier and in not very healthy way.  He lives in a row house just as he did in the first film and has a small restaurant that serves decent food but whose main attraction is for folks to come by and get a picture taken with Rocky and hear the champ tell his old stories for the ten thousandth time and Stallone does just the right touch on making the stories sound that way.

We also see him fill some of the emotional gaps in his life in a very touching way.  Since Adrian is ever present in his heart, it is very touching to see him develop a friendship with a woman that is really a friendship and not a prelude to something that could encroach on where Rocky really is emotionally.

The most wrenching relationship in the movie is between Rocky and his son.  Yes, sons do have to become their own man and it is incredibly tough to find an independent place to stand when your father was the heavyweight champion of the world and people want to know you to meet your father.  This is a very active force in Rocky's life and leads him in several directions that all make real sense.

I also appreciated the way the film actually set up the fight between Rocky and Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (by the very capable Antonio Tarver) by actually creating sympathy for him by making him unsympathetic.  Yes, a neat trick.  The film doesn't set him as a big villain as previous Rocky films did with Clubber Lang or Ivan Drago.

This was a very fine way to end the series and does so on a rather moving high note.",1174867200,4,2447,4.268980477223427

Sly Stallone gets knocked a lot by people (myself included) but no one is laughing at him now. Like his fictional son said in the film during his fight with Mason Dixon ""Everyone thought this was a joke, including myself! But no one is laughing now!""

The story, the acting....everything was well done. I only hope this is the end because I would hate to see it ruined by a bad follow-up. This is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and I would highly recommend this film to anyone's collection whether you're a fan or not!",1174867200,4,662,4.246031746031746
2743704,4,B000MRA58S,"When I first heard Sylvester Stallone was writing a sixth Rocky movie, I cringed. There was the initial dread of seeing an old Rocky in the ring coupled with the huge disappointment that was Rocky 5. Although too embarrassed to see it in theaters, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film on DVD, surely as fitting an ending as possible to one of my favorite action series.

But this film certainly doesn't fit in comfortably with the others, understandably so. This isn't the 80s. Rocky's wife is dead. He's older, slower and no longer involved with boxing except in telling old fightin' tales to customers of his modest restaurant in South Philly. Paulie is back and as annoying as usual, but this serves as a contrast to the humble, loyal Rocky we all know and love.

If you've seen the previews there are no big surprises. This movie isn't about a glorified exhibition match of a 50-something ex-champ versus a 30-something Antonio Tarver in his prime. It's about growing old, doing what you love and the importance of family. Adrian's memory is alive and well (plenty of flashbacks). Rocky's son is struggling to cope with the shadow of his beloved father, which follows him even in the corporate world.

At the end of the day, you're not supposed to hate ""villain"" Mason 'the line' Dixon. This fight is a reminder of what Rocky used to be and a great ending to a series spanning four decades. True Rocky fans will concur.",1174780800,4,1441,4.665354330708661

2743708,4,B000MRA58S,"Who would have expected Sylvester Stallone to be able to squeeze yet another movie out of his internationally successful Rocky series? Well, friends, the guy may have aged with the rest of us but Stallone's ability to go to the heart of the character he has made an icon still is strong. As a result ROCKY BALBOA, though overly sentimental at times (which is in keeping with the Rocky we have all grown to know) plays as a show of strength not only in the boxing ring, but also in the viability of the heart.

The aged Rocky runs a restaurant named after his deceased wife Adrian (who gratefully appears in flashbacks of the original Talia Shire) where he chats with his devoted customers as the still admired boxing hero of Philadelphia. His trainer Paulie (Burt Young) has aged too, but the two remain close.  Rocky also encounters a lonely single mother Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and befriends her and her racially mixed son Steps (James Francis Kelly III). Mildly estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia) who is trying to make a life for himself in his father's shadow, Rocky happens to see a spoof on television placing Rocky as the contender against the new heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Antonio Tarver, a boxer who was groomed as an actor for this film), a fighter who lacks soul and seems to foretell the end of passionate boxing. With such a huge support group Rocky decides to train and actually compete, fighting Dixon with multiple incentives. The ending demonstrates the power of willpower and the greater power of humanity and love because 'you gotta keep movin' forward'.

ROCKY BALBOA, then, is a fine finish for a series of films that have gained a permanent place in the history of cinema.  It is a pleasure to see Sylvester Stallone act and direct a very fine cast of actors in a genuinely satisfying film.  There are many worthwhile messages with the frames of this old-fashioned movie.

2743709,5,B000MRA58S,"After 16 years, Sylvester Stallone has accomplished what many figured would never happen. He came back with a new Rocky movie, and he came back with a really GOOD Rocky movie. Not only does Rocky still have punches in him, but so does Stallone. As a fan of the series, I can safely say that this is the best entry since the original. Quickly, the plot sees Rock running his own restaraunt, Adrian's, named after his deceased wife(Talia Shire is missed, but it works, and Shire herself says she trusts and believes in Sly with this twist in the story), and he doesn't have a strong relationship with his son(Milo Ventamiglia). A virtual reality boxing match on TV pitting him against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon(Antonio Carver)has Rocky defeating him, and setting up a real life match with Rocky coming out of retirement for one last match. It's an interesting premise, really, and it works. Some may think it takes too long to get going or to get to the action, but that's why it works. It's not just about action and boxing, but about the people and the character of Rocky. That's why I like it. I am just as interested, if not more, in the non-boxing aspects of the movie. The best thing about the Rocky films is that each one finds the Italian Stallion in a new part of his life and takes it from there. He's older now, and the film doesn't overlook it just for Rocky and Sly to have another shot at glory. It's about age. It's a big part of the film. That's one of the great things about the film. They are not overlooking reality and age just to make another film. I hear the same thing is being done for Indy 4. The flashback scenes are scarce(although others say otherwise), and the ""tour"" of the old haunts is nostalgic, affective, and well placed. This film feels like a Rocky film, and has a sense of the original film. Little Marie(Geraldine Hughes) is back, as well as Spider, and this leads to the film's closer touch to the classic original. Burt Young's Paulie is still Paulie, and it would seem out of place to have a Rocky movie without him. The movie is surprisingly real, emotional, and heartfelt. You can't help but get caught up in the situation and cheer Rock on one last time. The end match is great, and feels like the real deal. It's exceptionally planned out and set up, and makes the tension feel real as you watch it. Bill Conti's theme is back, and it still raises goosebumps when it starts up. Sly isn't the greatest actor, but he is Rocky, and he knows Rocky, and he is really good in the film, as well as behind the camera as a director. Rocky V had it's moments, but it was not the film to end on. This one is. It fits wonderfully, and it wraps it up perfectly. To see the love and respect Rocky gets from people, especially in the end, is heartwarming. It doesn't fail to bring a lump to your throat. To matter how old you get, or where your life takes you, Rocky Balboa tells you to never give up. Thanks for coming back with Rocky one more time Sly. You made a truly wonderful film for this iconic character and series to go out on.",1174694400,41,3063,4.356643356643357
2743710,4,B000MRA58S,"I found Rocky Balboa starring Sylvester Stallone to be surprisingly good. It could be possible that I didn't expect much from this movie that sounded so much like a cheap retread of old glory. In fact, like many, I had no intention of seeing it until I was coax into the theater. When I saw it, I was very surprised how good the movie turned out to be and how well Stallone presented this movie. The movie proves to be surprisingly deep, entertaining and well told story. As one previous reviewers stated, it proves to be a worthy ""bookend"". This is the best Rocky film since the first one came out 30 years ago. Stallone tell this story with certain amount of flair and good taste. It shouldn't surprised anyone by the time that familiar tune come blaring out that movie's format create a situation we all been waiting for. The fight scenes, exciting as it was, provided an end result of well put together movie. Since the story of this movie have been rehashed many times, I won't bother rehashing it again.

The DVD of this movie turned out to be pretty good. The images proves to be pristine, the sound was aggressive and clear and extras proves to be entertaining and educational.

Sylvester Stallone gambled greatly in making this movie. If it fail, he would have probably been heelhaul out of Hollywood. But fully understanding his own limitation as well as his character, Stallone put together a movie that will definitely surprise many who may see this movie for the first time on DVD.",1174608000,7,1494,4.612781954887218
2743711,3,B000MRA58S,"Stallone had to thank his lucky stars Talia Shire declined to do this movie. If Adrian was still alive what would this film be about??? Rocky Balboa centers around Adrian's death and Rocky's inability to move on with his life. And the fact that Shire opted out of Rocky 6 dictated the direction of this film.

I recently watched Rocky 1-3 just so I could get back in the grove before I watched Rocky Balboa. And half way into RB I felt very let down. Why? This movie felt.... forced to me. It is no secret that Sly needed this film to work. Sylvester had not had a hit film in a long time. He financed this movie himself and had a lot riding on it. And I felt like he was trying too hard to make it perfect. The dialogue felt too neat and rehearsed. Paulie was annoying. Mason Dixson had no heat with Rocky. The feud, if you could call it that, had no edge. Now Rocky vs Clubber Lang... THAT WAS INTENSE. Balboa vs Dixson had no real intrigue to me. Dixson was not a bad guy or a mean guy. He didn't make you want to hate him. Which is important in a Rocky film.

The main event looked like a REAL fight. You could tell that it was filmed with the same cameras used to shoot sporting events. It was pretty impressive. But the fight felt nothing like the fights in other Rocky series. Creed, Lang, Drago, these fights had a special feel. They had drama and passion. Hard hits. Tension. These older fights WERE Rocky. The style and presentation of these great fights is gone from Rocky Balboa. The main even in this movie feels like a TV fight. I felt a little detached. Like I wasn't in the ring. I wasn't feeling the punches or the anger. I wasn't involved in the outcome. I didn't care who won or lost.

The parts of the film that did work were the flashbacks. It was cool to see shots from the other movies intertwined with this film. I would have loved to see Mr. T or Dolph Lundgren make a cameo, but that did not happen.

Im glad this movie was a success for Mr. Stallone, as he is one of the greats. But he could have done better. That is just my opinion.",1174608000,3,2061,4.157894736842105
2743712,4,B000MRA58S,"I had the same thought everyone else probably had when I heard there would be a new Rocky movie: ""oh, I bet it will be total s...!"" How can a movie be made about a 60 year old man wanting to box again?(excuse me, 59 year old man--a few years shaved off in the story I noticed).  I've always viewed the first 3 movies as one long movie: It went from Rocky being a nobody to the champ, to losing and back again and part 4 & 5 were some other Rocky, in another dimension.  The first 3 movies were great, the others not so much for me personally.  Truth is the new movie is a fitting end to the Rocky series.  I've always thought the last movie, made in 1990, was the worst of the entire series, a big mess, and it just seemed like an odd way to end Rocky's boxing career, with a bare fisted street fight in a rundown Philli neighborhood with a Don King-type looking on saying 'touch me and I'll sue'.  For most of Rocky Balboa the movie has a somewhat depressing tone -well not somewhat... it IS depressing- and Rocky seems to dwell on the past and his deceased wife Adrian who died of the 'woman cancer' 4 years earlier.  It almost becomes pitiful and excruciating watching Rocky's life until he decides to return to boxing.  But hence I think Stallone knew this as well when he wrote this.  The movie seems to work, at least to me.  The look Stallone gives as he is walking out of the ring after the fight at the end of the movie and waving to the crowd is very moving.  His expression is almost as if he's saying 'thank you' to the audience, both in the movie and the audience/fans watching the movie.  That little look says it all about why he made this movie and why he wanted to make the movie.  It's true the movie is pretty much nostalgia(the hat, the gloves, the old gray sweatpants, the old apt. stoop, the steps leading up to the museum, the old neighborhood haunts, the bar, Spider Ricco, the turtles, the pet shop, the ice rink, the meat factory Paulie works at, little Marie and unfortunately, the downing of raw eggs by Rocky) but it works.  It was nice to see Rocky come back although I truly hope this is the last Rocky movie.  I don't want to see Rocky entering the ring with a cane when he's 80 years old or nothing like that.  The making of on the DVD is very good too.  You get to see how wild the fans act as he's filming the movie in and around Philladelphia.  The world truly loves Rocky.  And for Rocky fans, take note: Stallone mentions on the audio commentary that there will be a diretor's cut of the movie.  Can you say double dipping? Great movie nonetheless.  At least part V won't be the last chapter to the Rocky series.  The look as he's leaving the arena(in the new movie) says it all.",1174608000,6,2717,4.216634429400387

I mean Rocky is older, and although his character comes still quite strong as in any of the other films, everyone around him are just weak and lacking characters. Steps, his son, Paulie even are just standing around with frowns and a frozen stare for most of the film while Rocky still goes on and on about the world being lousy and you have to take your hits and get back up- you know all the same stuff he went on about in the other films before. And now it is just old to hear about.

Along with the lack of any real characters to care about besides Rocky, the story itself is just a little too unbelievable in my opinion. He being able to last in the ring with that young and uninteresting boxer I found a little silly and it wasn't played out in any way exciting.

The story is boring, the characters are worse- the only thing that helps this movie go to just 'okay' status is Rocky himself. After loving the character for so long through Rocky 1-4 (5 was pretty iffy too for me) you want to see how he turns out regardless. But besides the loveable Rocky character, nothing else is worthwhile to watch. So I say stick with Rocky 1-4, even 5 for it did have its moments, but it's not worth the time to watch this one. I just felt this last movie wasn't worth the time or money making it.

The greatest cinematic makeover in history.  Now, here comes the same ol' Rocky.  And for the most part, it was another welcome return.

If ever a person was born to play a part, Rocky Balboa is it for Sylvester Stallone.  Say what you will about the crass commercialism of Rocky's 3, 4, and 5, Sly rarely missed a beat.  Well, OK, there wasn't much to love about Rocky 5.  But even the lesser sequels got one thing right: Stallone stayed true to the character.

Wisely, he chose to write and direct this (one can only hope) final  installment, a fitting bookend to the saga.  Stallone has always been smarter than the characters he plays, and his script strikes a good balance between drama and self-deprecating humor.  [SPOILERS AHEAD] When a bunch of young punks throw a few verbal jabs at the aging ex-champ, their words ring true. . .yet you can't help but feel for the guy.  This may be a minority opinion, but I think this is easily Stallone's finest ACTING performance of the series.  That's right, I said ACTING.

Sure, the film eventually lapses into the predicable training montage, and maybe one too many speeches from the Italian Stallion.  But by taking the time to make you care about the characters again--it's been 16 years, after all--you may find yourself cheering in spite of yourself.

Now, on to the DVD itself.  We get a witty and insightful commentary from the Man himself.  There's also an alternate ending that shows just how much Stallone (and Rocky) has matured. . .twenty years ago, the more predictable, less-satisfying ending would probably have made the final cut.  A bunch of delted scenes are included, offering a bit more screen time for Burt Young's Paulie (who, incidentally, also gets my vote for best performance of the six ROCKY films).

If you've read this far, you're probably a big enough ROCKY fan to make the purchase.  It's a fine conclusion to the series, a story with heart and humor. . .and let's face it, that's become a rare combination these days.",1174521600,5,2161,4.656084656084656
2743717,5,B000MRA58S,"Rocky Balboa steps into the ring one last time for an exhibition match against heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. A virtual dream match says that if Dixon and Balboa were to fight in their prime, Balboa would win. It gets people talking and surely enough, Rocky's ready to rumble in Las Vegas. For the first time in his professional career, he's fighting without Adrian at his side; we learn that she lost her own fight to the ""woman cancer"". Paulie, Duke, and Rocky Jr. (now renamed Robert) along with Little Marie are all back to help the Italian Stallion go the distance.

I'm a huge Rocky fan; I grew up watching these movies over and over again (I saw 4 of them in theaters as they were coming out; Rocky III-IV-V and Rocky Balboa) and I couldn't wait to see this one when I first saw the trailer for it last fall. Kudos to Stallone for pulling this off and finishing the Rocky saga the way it was meant to end (Rocky V surprisingly is not as bad as we all remember it, but no less lightweight compared to the other entries in the series). The Stallion is in great shape and it shows. Stallone, who continues to write and direct the series, has injected a lot of emotion in this last ride; more so than the last two installments combined.

Bringing back Little Marie from the first film was very appropriate and Geraldine Hughes did a great job portraying her. I like the way Rocky and Marie's relationship develops; she needs him to believe in herself and he needs her to help fill the void Adrian left. Milo Ventimiglia was perfectly cast as Robert (whatever happened to the name Rocky Jr.?) who's been living in the shadow of a legend. Burt Young played Paulie the same way he's always done and we love him for it. Everything that made the Rocky films what they are is here: the training montage, the run up the museum steps, the flashbacks, Bill Conti's Rocky fanfare, and that exciting final boxing match. The boxing sequences were expertly filmed and the use of black and white at times was a nice touch.

Rocky Balboa is for all of us kids of the 70's and 80's who grew up watching Rocky fight Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago and kept asking for more. It bathes in nostalgia and delivers the goods on every level. Stallone should be proud to have his beloved character go out in a blaze of glory like this. It's been a great saga, we'll miss you Rocky.",1174521600,13,2385,4.440639269406392
2743718,3,B000MRA58S,"I don't know where Anthony C is getting his information, but everyone I know loves Rocky 5. Anyway, on to Rocky 6.

While it's absolutely great to revisit the old character, Rocky Balboa leaves a lot to be desired. I read that originally Adrian was included in the script but in the end he wanted Rocky to lose almost everything so the character would appear as desperate and lost as possible. I really think a much better way to do that would have been to include her in the first of the movie, go through the cancer with her and then to lose her, instead of her just not being there. We never got to see Balboa's pain of losing her, and to me that is a major drawback.

Mason and Steps are extremely poorly developed, and both of these ""actors"" have absolutely no acting skill whatsoever. A cardboard standup could have played either of their roles. Stallone should have developed steps a bit more, and chosen a boxer with more character to play Mason. I found these two characters extremely flawed.

I also seriously questioned the ability of Rocky to run a successful business, negotiate in the marketplace and make any money. I mean, this is a guy who couldn't read ""smell manly"" in the commercials he tried to do in Rocky 2, now he's a business man? Someone would either be robbing him blind or he'd be bankrupt with his level of intelligence. So for me, to say that he was running a business was a little far fetched unless it's a boxing gym or something, which would have been a much better choice for the character.

Stallone himself even seems tired in this film. He never really laughs, and even his jokes seem tired. I know he's lost everything, but who wants to see Rocky with almost no sense of humor, and never having a good time no matter what he does?

Having said all that, it is simply fantastic to revisit the character. I found myself very emotional when the Rocky theme started playing. At the end, realizing that this would be the last Rocky movie ever, I just sat still for a while. Not many movies have that sort of ""punch.""

It was fantastic to see him really give the character a final send off. Production was good, camera work is awesome and I enjoyed the script for the most part.

After 16 years without a Rocky movie, I really feel that anything he did was bound to be a hit. I think people are overrating this movie because they aren't looking at it as a movie itself, but just thinking about how nice it is to revisit the character.

Rating the movie by itself, it's hard to give it more than three stars, and I am a HUGE Rocky fan.",1174521600,2,2566,4.376050420168068

It was a great moment to feel, something like that again from my childhood. Don't get me wrong  I was still skeptical of this movie being any good,after Rocky 5. I was worried the same ideas would be instilled in this movie. Sylvester Stallone could not have written this movie any better, any different then how this movie was written. In my opinion this movie is as good as the first and second. Sylvester did an amazing job writing this movie and did not make this movie a joke, like it could have been very easily.

The last few years have seen quite a few ""inspirational"" sports movies, and I usually turn up my nose.  Not this time.  This movie has heart, and in the end, that is what truly matters to blue collar folks who go through the same battles with themselves everyday, looking for some sort of motivation.  You were able to show a caring soul, in ""Rocky's"" character, without crossing the overly predictable and cliched themes that a lot of movies would've turned to.

Let me reveal my bias -- I loved the first movie. I watched it in theaters more than a dozen times. So let's not waste time with a real review. Let's talk nostalgia. ""Rocky Balboa"" ties back into every original subtext. Stallone reinforces his vision by recasting bit players like Pedro Lovell as Spider Rico (a great cameo).

The theme hasn't changed. Keep moving forward; don't quit. This time, Rocky is older and wiser. I loved the subtext of a wiser Rocky. I believed.

This is an emotionally satisfying movie. If you've followed the series, you've seen the ups and downs. This is the right way to end the series. Anything less would have been unfair to an original and compelling character.",1174348800,28,879,4.658064516129032

Other then that this most beloved series has facinated people over the years and even decades. My first rocky I ever saw was three and I just had to see the other two. About that time Rocky four was in production with Dolph Lundgren and and when I saw it in theaters fans cheered on the italian stallion.it was so loud from fans in there when he knocked out the russian it was deafening. Then when number five came out and the fight did not for once take place in the ring
Once again the Philedelphia Iron man came through. I thought thats it what a way for a series to go out. Shame that its over with now after five films .NNNNNOOOOOOO not yet. In this last installment the gloves go one one more time to prove that when you love something so much. When you want to go one more time to prove something. When your hungry for just one last time its magic within you that keeps you going. Rocky started out going the distance with Apollo Creed.he didn't win the title but showed what he had. After six films Rocky Balboa has shown that the old lion can still bite the young lion. Just ask Mason ""THE LINE""Dixon. Rocky stepped over that line and showed Dixon a few things win lose or draw if you have heart you can do it. Rocky is one of the true American icons in the movies and we would all do well to follow his example.

I admit, it moved slowly at first, and I did get kinda sick of all the reminicing and wanted more boxing, but hey, it did deliver in the end, and it true rocky style.  Talia Shire, Adrian, was not in this movie, but much of the movie revolved around her spirit.  I wonder if after rocky V she said she'd rather be dead than be in another rocky movie.  Well, now she probably wants her publisist dead for not getting her into it.  Oh well, the movie is decent, good action, and good message.

This story has heart. The film moves very quickly because of the story, the great acting of Stallone and Young, and also Geraldine Hughes as Marie is a delight. The final fight blew me away. This is a fitting conclusion to the Rocky series. I bought it on its release date today and have devoured it. I highly recommend it.",1174348800,3,654,4.404958677685951
2743747,4,B000MRA58S,"It is easy enough to say that ""Rocky Balboa"" is a much better ending to the cinematic saga of Sylvester Stallone's most famous creation than ""Rocky V,"" because that 1990 was clearly the bottom of the barrel for the franchise.  But ""Rocky Balboa,"" the new ""last"" Rocky movie is not only a lot better than the last ""last"" Rocky movie, it does a good job of bringing things full circle and reminding us of why the original 1976 film scored a big upset by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture.

Adrian has died and Rocky's son (Milo Ventimiglia) is tired of living in his the shadow of his famous father, who spends his days at his wife's grave and his nights at his bar.  With his old friend Paulie (Burt Young) in tow, Rocky visits all of his haunts from the old days (that is to say, from the first film), and pretty much everything is in ruins.  The exception is ""Little"" Marie (Geraldine Hughes), the kids who rejected his advice in the original film with the comeback ""Screw you, creepo.""  She is grown up now and a single mom, and when she denies she ever said anything that rude he assures her that she did, adding a comment about the longevity of great insults.  Rocky takes an interest in Marie and her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III), hoping to fill the voids in his life but never thinking that they are replacing his wife and son.  Then the Fates once again intervene in his life and give Rocky an unlikely match against the unpopular current heavyweight champ, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), which means it will be time to cue Bill Conti's famous music, go through another training montage, and have Rocky climb the steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum.

However, all of that happens relatively late in the film.  Of course, Stallone wrote and directed the grand finale, and having thought long and hard about his character that is primarily what this film is about.  The fight is a necessary part of the Rocky formula and therefore of this story, but most of the memorable scenes and lines from this film come before Rocky ever steps into the ring.  One of the casualties of the Rocky franchise was the fantastic lesson of the original film that you can be a winner without winning.  That is the sort of thing that Yogi Berra might say (or that Joe Garagiola might say that Yogi said), which is quite apt since Berra's ""It ain't over 'till it's over"" is the film's tagline.  But such ideas are at the heart of the Rocky mythos and Stallone has not simply returned to them, but found a way to rearticulate them in terms of the life of his character at this age and at the center of his shrinking circle of family and friends.  One of his best moves is that the big fight is meaningful for his opponent as well.

Stallone is not only working off of the Rocky mythos but also drawing inspiration from the real world of boxing, explicitly updating the original computer match that had Rocky Marciano beating Muhammad Ali.  There is also the idea of the ex-champ's restaurant, which harkens back at least to Jack Dempsey's place, where he tells stories and poses for photos (Ali makes people pose for shots where you put your fist against his chin like you are landing a hard one on him).  Stallone knows that even those who do not own a George Foreman grill probably know that he was the oldest man to win the heavyweight crown even if they do not remember how old (Foreman was 45 when he won the title, 20 years after losing it to Ali, and would hold it another three years).  So in Stallone's screenplay Mason ""The Line"" Dixon gets the chance to prove the computer wrong and as soon as that robe comes off in the right before the fight it is clear that even at ""50,"" Rocky is totally chiseled and in a lot better shape than Foreman.  We are also reminded that Stallone knows he is doing when he choreographs a fight.  Included in the deleted scenes is an alternative ending that only reinforces what we already knew: namely that what you see in this movie is the way the saga of Rocky should end (Stallone's commentary track is well worth listening to as he juggles his varying perspectives as writer, director and actor).

For me things get a bit too artsy in the fight, where suddenly shots are looking like a cross between ""Raging Bull"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" and every since that slow-motion fall and rise ending to ""Rocky II"" I start to worry when Stallone starts getting too cute.  But whereas previous bouts have been about Rocky finally landing the big blow, this one is definitely all about Rocky being hit.  In case anybody does get the point, the key line in the film echoes in Rocky's mind at the pivotal moment: ""But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward.""  We have had ample reason to be cynical and Stallone and his creation for a couple of decades now, but both the creator and his creation evince a lot of the heart that made us care about them in the first place.",1174348800,10,5011,4.445414847161572

2743749,4,B000MRA58S,"Sylvester Stallone is back for the 6th time as Rocky Balboa. Yes he's old which had many people including myself making fun of the fact that he was doing another. Yet Stallone manages to pull it off anyway. It's about him trying to prove that he's a somebody yet again. Since spectators try to say he was over-rated and that a famous boxer of today would destroy him. A computer fight shows that Rocky would win but not many people actually agree with it. The movie isn't all about the fight though. It's about Rocky trying to move on after the death of his beloved wife Adrian and trying to get back into the life of his son. It's also about as smart as the first one.

  I always have found myself thinking about the girl he gave advice about not smoking in part 1. She's even back in this one and Rocky is looking out for her once again. The movie could've easily have given us a romance between the two but Stallone's script is smart enough to know that Rocky could probably never get with another woman after Adrian. So they just have a little innocent flirtation thing going on.

  The movie is good but I don't think there's even any mention of the fact that he had a serious concussion after his fight in part 4. Which is why he was even retired in the first place since another fight would've risked brain damage. But who cares really since it's nice to see Stallone and Burt Young on screen together one last time anyway. The film wasn't needed that much but still it's a respectful reunion with Stallone giving his best performance in awhile. Rocky doesn't only make a great comeback but so does Stallone since before this he has been making made for dvd movies for a few years now. I think he's going a little too far by making a Rambo 4 though...lol.

Although I was sceptical, I of course had to see the movie, and I must admit it blew me away. One of my main concerns were how they would explain Rocky going back into the ring again, seeing that he's 60 years old and all, but they made quite convincingly made it plausible. The storyline is very good if a bit simple, and the acting is solid. Stallone delivers a good performance as an aging Balboa looking for meaning and purpose with his existence. You really feel for him as he goes through all the obstacles between him and the fight.

Also one of the things I enjoyed very much about the movie was, that there is no animosity. The two fighters don't hate each other, there's not really any bad feelings in there, only good sportsmanship.

The production values are of course top notch and more importantly the fight choreography is as good as ever.

I didn't see why it was necessary to make another movie...  That was until I saw this film.

This movie truly gave closure to the series and was beautifully put together.  I'm never one for spoilers, so you'll have to watch the movie, but I'm telling you, as a huge Rocky fan, this movie is worth it.  All the ""Why's"", the ""What for's"", and the ""This isn't necessary's"" are put to rest as the movie comes to a close.  It is a beautiful way to end it and I'm so glad they made this movie.

I was skeptical at first, but all of my concerns were put to rest by the film.  If you've enjoyed the Rocky films and haven't seen this, it is a must, for it completes the story of the greatest underdog in the history of film.

2743752,5,B000MRA58S,"In this day and age of ""equal rights"" for all orientations, it is highly refreshing to see such an old-fashioned macho man like Rocky Balboa.  I am quite a fan of Mr. Stallone and his Rocky series, and found Adrian (his wife) to be a strong feminist-type presence.  It is no secret that she is no longer with us, and I worried my well-fed rear off that her absence would hurt the movie.  Not so, as Mr. Stallone handles her passing with great sensitivity - never letting the audience forget how much that tigress meant to him.

As a confirmed neo-feminist, I find it perfectly acceptable to desire a strong ol' guy while also maintaining my own identity. The reason, I think, that so many people ended up wanting to see this movie is because in these overly sensitive ""politically correct"" times, there is a strong appeal in seeing such a straight-ahead tough guy who knows what he wants and how he plans to get it without ever compromising who he is nor conceding to the societal pressures that force so many to sell out their own personal integrity.

I was a little iffy regarding the character of Marie.  While I applaud Stallone for resisting temptations to fire up a romance between he and Marie, I also felt he was a little too fatherly in his attempts to control her life.  Bravo to her for telling him that he was offering too much, but boo to her for ending up accepting such help.  Not really a part of the neo-femme credo.  Her son Steps was also a little ineffective and wasn't seen learning many lessons in masculinity from Rocky.

Back to the subject of grieving a lost spouse, while I have never experienced that harsh reality - I have relatively recently split with a male companion (shouldn't the term 'boyfriend' end with the onset of middle age?). I was heartbroken and remain very depressed as I feel lonely (not to mention that my biological clock is about to stop ticking, and no amount of winding is likely to restart it).  Watching this movie, I was reminded of the type of love I have been close to many times yet somehow have managed to miss. Why are some of us so unlucky? Don't I deserve my own Rocky Balboa??

Thank you for indulging me in such a personal take on this movie. I dare not spoil anything about the big fight, but for me it was not all that important.  Stallone crafted an excellent character study and by the time the training sequence begins it is almost beside the point. Not a criticism mind you, it is in fact a huge compliment to the first 70 or so minutes of the movie.  Did I cry?  Yes.  Did I wet myself?

The local radio station joked about it and my friends agreed, but I walked away compelled to write this.. so that has to mean something. Honestly, I think those who found this in poor taste probably never thought much of the first Rocky.

In the end this movie had little to do with fighting and much more to do with his life outside the ring...to pursue and prove his own existence. It sounds too sentimental, but Rocky manages to strike a balance surprisingly well. Its a good take home message, specially during these volatile times, when human spirit seems to be defined by our foes and enemies, Rocky manages to convince us that it is more about the struggle within ourselves.

Its a very fitting finale, and Im quite astonished, Sylvester Stallone pulled it off. Even up until the end where he walks out of the ring before the fight is even called, there is much to admire. This movie had more heart than many of the critically acclaimed boxing movies Ive seen of recent times.

I only found fault in the fight itself. It ended well, but the choreography was poorly executed. In line with the credibility of the story, they should have taken out most of the 10 dozen career ending haymakers. Rocky seemed absolutely clueless to the blocking technique.

Rocky's now a widower, having lost Adrian to cancer, and has a shaky relationship with his son. He's living a quiet life in retirement, but still feels that he has something left to prove to himself. He gets his chance and another bout in the ring with Mason Dixon.

We were surprised--looked at each other and chuckled in disbelief--when we found out about macho superstar Sylvester Stallone making another Rocky movie. Once again, he was going to direct it and write it. Personally--as a boxing fan--I thought it would never work. The film would not be believable not only because of his age, but also because of his fading super star status. We had doubts about his new production. We thought about recent turkeys like Spy Kids 3-D, I See You and Driven--Can he comeback and bring his good old days? Sly cannot be serious, can he? We were so wrong. This is a true Hollywood comeback in every sense of the word. Rocky Balboa is an excellent and uplifting film about one of the greatest American icons of our time.

Story:

Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) lives a peaceful life in his home city of South Philadelphia. He has retired from boxing and now he owns a modest restaurant where he tells old boxing stories to his guests. He always remembers his wife Adrian (Talia Shire) who passed away few years back. He drives around to visit old places where they used to be together along with his companion Paulie (Burt Young) who is not too happy about Rocky living in the past. His son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia)--who lives on his own--is troubled by the way he's treated by everyone because of his ""son of the champion"" status. As Rocky wonders around his old neighborhood, he meets a bartender Marie (Geraldine Hughes) who he builds--perhaps a romantic--friendship.

There is a new heavyweight champion in the world of boxing. Mason 'The Line' Dixon (Anthony Tarver) dominates his weigh class with virtually no one left to challenge him. He is proud, but very unlikable character in the world of prizefighting. Sports TV network ESPN runs a show where they use computer generated graphics to recreate dream boxing matches--from boxers of different eras. They recreate a dream fight between Rocky Balboa and Dixon, the computer says that Rocky would win. Dixon does not think too much of it, but Rocky sees an opportunity for redemption. He decides to get his boxing license back despite the opinions of his son and old Pauli--Marie is very supportive. Dixon's managers see an opportunity to make more money and convince the current champion to fight Rocky. They contact Rocky and he accepts. Now it is time for the people's champion to fight one more time. Will he even survive the first round?

Review:

Stallone goes back to the character that made him famous and delivers one of the best films of 2006. He is true to the character--a beloved and wiser--Rocky Balboa who still believes in his heart that it's never too late to step up in the ring. He shows the world that there are no boundaries--not even his age--when it comes to pursuit of happiness. We see him training with enthusiasm, despite the negativism around him. In other words, his performance and the story reach out the audience in a way never before. He inspires and motivates everyone to stand up for themselves. He literally makes the audience stand up and cheer.

In the technical department, Rocky Balboa does marvels. The traditional shots of the city of Philadelphia are back, but look better than ever. We are surprised of how beautiful the photography is in this film, giving us the feeling of the old Rocky films. The first half of the film might be talky for some, but it's done to develop the character. The last part of the film is where the fireworks begin.

Boxing fans will be pleased by the way the fight scenes are presented. The way they broadcast the main event is so realistic--even real boxing celebrities are involved--that is like watching a PPV boxing event in real time. The aerial shots of Las Vegas, the camera work, the introduction of the fighters, the tale of the tape down to the announcers and the referee gives the audience that illusion. Stallone combines some of the old school Rocky type flashbacks while fighting--the best of both worlds combined.

The Verdict:

We thought this would be a weak one, we take it back now. Stallone brings back the beloved character--and most of his corner--to deliver a ""feel good"" film that is not going to disappoint. Rocky Balboa has a compelling story, great acting and visuals that will keep you cheering for more.",1173657600,8,4312,4.7913862718707945
2743781,4,B000MRA58S,"I just wanted to say that I am a Rocky fan from the beginning and have been deeply touched by the ""Rocky"" saga. Rocky has always been first out of my mouth when asked about my favorite movies. I loved the way Stalone ""Bowed out"" Rocky in ""Rocky Balboa"". Sly kind of left Rocky defeated in ""Rock V"". And even though Rocky Lost the fight in ""Rocky Balboa"" - technically. ""Rocky"" The series ""bowed out"" triumphantly. I love Rocky Balboa. I started weeping almost from the opening ""curtain"". For me the farewell at the end when Rocky turned and waved to the crowd at the statium, He was saying good bye to all of us. ( I am choking back even while I write this). I know Stalone took a lot of creative license in all of the series ( frankly I think He does so in all of his works, most of which I love as well - Although I can't imagine how Sly could possible ""Bow out"" Rambo, Maybe give ""him"" a seat in the US congress), But I find some strange ability in my heart to look past that when it comes to Rocky ( and Rambo), where as most of the time I am unable to do so with most other artistic expression.  I tell people that While there is boxing in the movies the series really isn't about boxing... They all think I'm crazy. To me Rocky is first of all, a love story, And about overcoming overwhelming odds. It's about the fight all of us wage with our inner self. And rising to the occassion dispite the odds. I would also like to thank Stalone for the triumphant exit of our beloved ROCKY! ( ""Rocky"" is a fictional story and while I love the ""Story "" deeply...

Sylvester Stallone closes the greatest underdog story of our time by taking it back to it's roots. Rocky back in Philly, as it ended in Rocky V, original music by Bill Conti, and old characters from the first movie. What a way to end a classic series. A must see for any Rocky fan.",1173052800,4,388,4.256756756756757
2743797,4,B000MRA58S,"Rocky Balboa is the final installment in the great Rocky franchise that began thirty years ago with the original film winning the best picture Oscar. The final film goes back to the roots of the series and focuses on Rocky as a person, and as a man, and ignores the flash of Rocky IV and the silliness of Rocky V.

 Rocky is older now, and all he has left are memories of his boxing career and memories of Adrian, who died a few years ago. Rocky spends his nights entertaining customers at his Italian restaurant (called ""Adrian's"") with stories of his boxing glory. On the anniversary of Adrian's death, he tours the location where they first lived, their first date and then visits the grave. A reluctant Pauley goes with Rocky but his son Robert is absent.

 Rocky sees a computer simulated fight of himself and current champ Mason Dixon. Rocky wins the computer fight and this gives Rocky the bug to do a little fighting again, to maybe try and get in shape. Meanwhile, Mason Dixon's managers are urging him to fight an exhibition with Rocky in hopes of improving his reputation and to make tons of money.

 Rocky Balboa has several strengths and weaknesses. First, Sylvester Stallone is excellent in the movie. He plays Rocky as a man just trying to be good, trying to be a good father, trying to please the people in his world. Out in public, he graciously signs autographs and poses for pictures even though you can tell he's been doing it for years. Paulie is good in the movie and through flashbacks we see Creed, Adrian and Mickey. The final fight is done as an HBO broadcast and the fight is really awesome. It is much more realistic than any of the fights from the previous movies. Also, the Bill Conti score is exceptional. If you are a fan of the series, this will be a great conclusion for you.

 Now for the complaints. Some people can nitpick about how he deals with his son and another kid that he befriends, but those subplots didn't bother me. Rocky spends the first hour of the movie moping around his restaurant. Knowing how the movie ends, I would have liked to see a little more of him staying in shape, because he'd have to be in shape to fight they way he does at the end. That being said, the training they do show via a montage is set to ""Gonna Fly Now"" and is predicable, boring and short. The fight is realistic, but the story told via the fight is pretty bland. Again, minor complaints, but I want you to know this isn't a ""perfect"" movie.

 Rocky Balboa is a good movie, not great, but to a diehard Rocky fan, it could be considered great. It wipes the sour taste of Rocky V out of our mouth and will leave you presently surprised to see that Sylvester Stallone still has it. ROCKY! ROCKY! ROCKY!",1173052800,9,2728,4.4271457085828345

This is the allure of why the Rocky Balboa character till this day  maintains its popularity. He is someone whom represents all that is good in the human condition, someone willing to fight for what they want no matter the cost, treat others with repect and teach his successes and failings to others. All in all a real gentlemen, a type of person who is sorely missed in todays money driven and shallow society.  This film is essentially a drama about getting old with a small amount of boxing thrown in to send the old fella off in style. Even the most jaded viewer would find it hard not be the inspired by this old fashioned tale. Proof that even at 60 Sly still has a great ability to write and perform great characters. I have heard this film criticised for its mawkishness however the sentiments of this film are truely heartfelt and honest. This film is recommended for people of all ages and sexes and regardless of whether or not they have seen the entire Rocky series of films or enjoy boxing. This is a moving and uplifting tale that should have received more recognition then simply being dismissed as ""just another Rocky"".

Well, it just goes to show you that you don't know how good or bad something is until it's finished and ready (with some notable exceptions, of course).

I'm not going to spoil any of the plot for you, I'm just going to say that if you love the character of Rocky Balboa, this is the fitting and just sendoff that his story demanded, and much better than could ever have been expected. Plus, the film's center has a surprisingly tender heart at its core with Stallone (who also wrote and directed the film) reminding us what a charismatic, charming on-screen persona he has. He should be proud of this last round for The Rock.

2743823,5,B000MRA58S,"When the lights came up on 1990's Rocky V, like most filmgoers, I thought that I'd seen the last of Rocky Balboa, the indomitable everyman who, through the course of five movies, took the heavyweight boxing title not once, but twice (and also singlehandedly won the Cold War). Certainly if you'd told me then that we'd get the chance to revisit this character nearly two decades on, I would've called you crazy.

And yet, like his cinematic alter-ego of thirty years, writer-director-star Sylvester Stallone apparently still had ""some stuff left in the basement,"" and here we are sixteen years later, with Sly once more lacing up those padded gloves and stepping into the squared circle for one final (""We really mean it this time!"") bout.

I guess that's why, for me, there was a bittersweetness to watching Rocky Balboa. The whole experience had the feeling of seeing a friend you never thought you'd meet again, knowing you have to say goodbye before too long. If that sounds a trifle maudlin, so be it. Nevertheless, with this character, the big-hearted fighter from South Philly, Stallone assured his own place in the annals of filmdom by creating one of the most indelible, enduring, iconic roles in movie history. So it's hard not to feel attached to the big lug.

In Rocky Balboa, the two-time former champ is at his lowest ebb personally. His beloved wife Adrian has passed away (from ""the woman's cancer""), his son is a largely-infrequent presence in his life, and he mostly spends time at his semi-successful Italian restaurant regaling customers with tales of his former glory. This is a Rocky at the twilight of his career, largely pushed to the wayside by things shinier and newer. This is a Rocky who has become, in essence, the guest star of his own story. And yet...he still has something to offer (cue Bill Conti's ""Gonna Fly Now"").

The ""Rocky"" story is a timeless myth for the ages (yes, even the fourth one). More than that, the entire Rocky cinematic cycle, from 1976's original through the four sequels and now with Rocky Balboa, represents a singular achievement in movie lore: tracking the life and times of a single fictional character, essentially in real time, over the course of three decades. We've seen the highs, we've seen the lows, and now we're seeing him off.

RB is a movie about love. It also reminds us of what is important in life, not to give up and believe in yourself.

2743826,5,B000MRA58S,"When it was revealed that there was going to be a Rocky VI, many naysayers groaned and complained that enough was enough and that Sly was too over the hill and couldn't pull it off.  But the TRUE FANS out there knew differently.  Even the critics, who initially made skeptical/negative comments about the sixth installment, started turning their stories around after viewing the film in its entirety.  Rocky Balboa is a real winner of a movie, that fully realizes the essence of the original classic and brings the saga full circle to a thrilling, emotional, and very memorable conclusion.

Many years have gone by since last we saw Rocky, who is now a widower, estranged from his son and still mourning the loss of his beloved wife, Adrian.  There are some truly touching moments of Rocky at the cemetery, sitting by her grave (when I saw the film in theaters, no one in the audience made a sound - even the rowdy ones - during these scenes, out of pure respect for the characters) as well as Rocky's journey, with Paulie, to all the places he took Adrian on their classic first date.  So touching.

Now Rocky has his own restaurant, where he greets his customers and regales them with past stories of glory.  But deep inside of him is a rage that he must get out of himself and conquer in order to move on with his life.  The only way to do that is to go back in the ring.  But when a computer simulated match between Rocky and the current reigning heavyweight champion of the world, Mason Dixon, is shown on TV, showing Rocky as the victor, word spreads like wildfire for the real thing.

No Rocky film is complete without a training montage, and this film's got it in spades.  Stallone has the character of Rocky so integrated within himself, and gives nothing short of one of his finest performances on screen.  Many memorable scenes, including Rocky's long and emotional talk with his son, as well as his new relationship with Marie (the young woman Rocky walked home back in the first installment) make for truly compelling drama.  And the climactic fight at the finale is the icing on the cake.  It's inspirational and never disappoints for a second.

Rocky Balboa belongs in the collection of every fan (and non-fan alike for that matter) and the DVD is loaded with wonderful bonus features, including Audio Commentary with Stallone, Deleted Scenes, Featurettes, Alternate Ending, and more.  Pick this film up and watch it again and again.  You'll be happy you did.

Stallone owns a restaurant, and after retirement, it seems he remains in heavy weight champion shape! I loved the parts in the other Rocky movies, where you could see him rebuilding his body, getting it into shape. And thirdly, the fight sequences. I am a boxing fan and would have liked to see him having flashbacks of himself struggling, fighting, reliving those great achievements, fights and opponents in his mind, like any retired fighter would do. Strategizing and planning his up and coming fight. NOTHING of Apollo Creed ( C Weathers ), Clubber Lang ( Mr. T ), Captain Ivan Drago ( D Ludgren )... But the movie caries a powerful message: you have to find and be yourself, no matter what others say about you. Even if you are past the ""sell by"" date.

Rocky seems to be living a normal life on the outside but is being eaten away by the grief he has since Adrian has gone.

Another part of the story is Mason Dixon, the current heavweight boxing champ.  He is struggling with unpopularity because he has not fought any worthy competitors.  He is being run around by his agents and doesn't like it.

A computer simulation shows how the current champ (Dixon)would have done against Rocky and he would have lost by KO in the 13th round.  This simulation gets rocky motivated to fight again but only on a small scale.  Dixon's promoters see a chance to raise the champ's popularity and quickly arrange a fight between Rocky and Mason Dixon.

All in all this movie was really good and made up for the one that I will not dignify by name here.  They consequently leave out just about any trace of that unfortunate film.  This movie gives more exposure to the emotional and psychological background of Rocky and Paulie (Burt Young, who did an awesome job in this movie).

If I were to give a criticism of this movie it would be in Mason Dixon's development as a boxing titan.  At no point in this movie do you get a sense that he is as dominating as they try to make him out to be.  In the other movies Rocky fought monsters, any one of which would have by appearances absolutely destroyed Mason Dixon.  The only opponent that might not have beaten him would have been Spider Rico, whose character makes a comeback in this movie.

2743866,5,B000MRA58S,"Sylvester Stallone did an outstanding job not only acting in this movie, but directing it too. I thought that this new version would be a fluke after seeing part 5. I was thinking that Rocky would get his a** kicked being so old. But after seeing this new version I was pleasantly surprised... Even though he is 62 in the storyboard, Rocky definetely

proves that the last thing to age on any human being is the heart. How amazing is that?  I bought the ""Rocky"" collectors edition on DVD and it came with a free ticket to go and see Rocky Balboa so I took a friend of mine to go see it. This movie is incredible! It has even more heart than the original from 1976 and is by far the best Rocky movie in the whole series. An amazing fact to point out about this film is that Antonio Tarver is a real life fighter just as Tommy Morrison was a real boxer used for part 5.

What makes this film interesting is that the end fight sequences are as real as real can get. Every single punch that Rocky Balboa and Mason ""The Line' Dixon throw is a real one. HBO borrows the blueprint for a realistic fight sequence and seeing this in the theater was like getting a courtside seat to a boxing match. Special guest appearances by 'Iron Mike' Tyson, referee Joe Cortez, and Larry Greene from HBO Sports was an awesome touch.

The plot sees Rocky as a retired boxer living in the same philly neighborhood running an upscale restaurant named after his wife Adrian, who dies for reasons unknown. After a virtual television match puts rocky against the current heavyweight champion Mason 'The Line' Dixon that's botched by reporters & managers, the two agree to set up a charity exhibition match in Las Vegas. 'Skill vs. Will' The thing I loved the most about this movie is that it has a good message about following your dreams and not letting life get you down no matter how hard things hit you or stand in your way. As Stallone says, ""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done."" I highly recommend this movie to anybody... It will help inspire you to become the best person that you can be.

Yo Adrian, we did it! We did it...",1170028800,12,2191,4.34718826405868
2743867,4,B000MRA58S,"Everyone's favorite underdog is back in the game, as Sylvester Stallone brings back the character that made him a household name in the first place, with the sixth entry is the popular Rocky series ""Rocky Balboa"" (apparently, Roman numerals are no long in). Going into ""Rocky Balboa"" is like walking into a bad teenage comedy, as you go in with low expectations and more then a little cynicism. Yeah, sure, the original ""Rocky"" was critically acclaimed and won the Academy Award for Best Picture, but that was in 1976. This is 2006. That's about...a thirty year gap between the original movie and the current one. And Stallone is now sixty. Can he really pull off acting young anymore? The answer is no, so Stallone doesn't even try. Instead of pretending he's still 22, Stallone has Rocky retired at the age of 62, who is running a successful restaurant but has a strained relationship with his son ever since his wife died of causes that are not revealed in the film.

Then one of those computer simulators sets up a virtual fight with Rocky fighting the current heavy weight champion of the world Mason ""The Line"" Dixon. The computer deems Rocky would win in a fight, which gets Rocky into wondering what it would be like to get back into fighting. Rocky doesn't consider getting back in the ring for glory or fame, but more for the fact that he's somewhat stuck in time and wants the past back. Rocky constantly visits places he and Adrian used to visit, much to his brother-in-law's frustration. ""You're problem is that you're living in the past. But I can't do that anymore,"" Pauli tells Rocky on the anniversary of Adrians death. For once, Pauli actually comes off as the wise one. Everything in Rocky's life is about the past. Rocky may own a restaurant (named Adrians appropriately enough), but Rocky doesn't actually manage the business or cook the food, he just dresses up in a nice suit and tells the costumers stories of his boxing career, taking a photo once in awhile.

His son loves his dad, but is frustrated that he passes through life based on the fact that he is the son of a former heavy weight champion. Even Rocky's friend Marie, the girl he walked home near the beginning of the first movie, is helped by Rocky mainly because Rocky can see the results of something good he did in the past. When the opportunity to fight Mason comes to Rocky's table, he accepts the fight because he wants to put the past behind him. In a phrase that will most likely become one of the most popular lines of dialog in history, Rocky tells his son ""Life's not about how many punches you can throw at it, it's about how many times you can get hit and continue to punch back."" When we finally get to the big fight, Rocky is once again an underdog. No longer young, looking a little frail, but with just enough determination that you can't help but hope he wins.

Yet the road will not be easy. ""Rocky Balboa"" delivers everything you expect a Rocky movie to have, from inspirational speeches, to a training montage, to spouts with minor characters. All of this we expect, yet it feels fresh and interesting. The characters have something to say to each other, and the storyline is very human and personal. I was amazed by how involved I got with these characters, considering that I haven't really spent any time with them in years, and all of them look completely different then when I last saw them. When Rocky first ran up those stairs and lifted his fists in the air, he was saying something to the world. Now he's saying something else, and it's just as inspiring as the last thing he had to say. By bringing Rocky down to our level, and dealing with the issue's we've all been joking about, Rocky becomes the underdog once again, and we're only happy to root for him some more. ""Rocky Balboa"" is one of the best films of the year.

Sylvester Stallone delivers an affecting performance as the iconic boxer who defies skepticism by taking on the current heavyweight champion (Antonio Tarver) in a Vegas exhibition match.

2743871,5,B000MRA58S,"""It ain't over `til it's over,"" the tagline for ROCKY BALBOA proudly proclaims.  The truth of the matter is, as moviegoers realize and even Sylvester Stallone himself freely acknowledges, that it was over four films ago.  Why is it, then, that ROCKY BALBOA packs the most fierce and delightful punch since the original masterpiece?  Why is it that thirty years and five sequels later, we still leap up in our seats, toss our popcorn aside, and cheer for Rocky Balboa?  The answer is one word: heart.  The film has heart, and it has it because ROCKY BALBOA stays true to the heart of the original film, long before the increasingly silly sequels began flying like Balboa's much-acclaimed punches.

In ROCKY BALBOA, the titular hero has given up his boxing career (which he actually did at the start of ROCKY V - remember ROCKY V?) and now runs a successful restaurant in the slums of Philadelphia.  His beloved wife Adrian has passed on, and his son has grown up to be an office worker haunted by his father's huge shadow.  His best friend Paulie (the wonderful Burt Young) continues to work in the meat shop.  Meanwhile, back in the ring, ferocious young fighter Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) has taken over as the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and has absolutely no competition, having never been defeated in his career.  When a controversial ""fight simulation"" between Dixon and Rocky Balboa airs on ESPN, Dixon's publicity-starved managers attempt to set up an exhibition between the current and former Heavyweight Champions of the World.  To the dismay of most of Rocky's friends, he decides to fight Dixon, realizing that it may be the ultimate way to finally accept Adrian's passing.

Although this film began building up immense hype immediately after it became known that it was being made, I was positive it would be the weakest of the series after viewing its outrageous trailer.  I don't think I was alone in that prediction, and I'm sure that there are still many people who avoided seeing this film because, well, five ROCKYs was enough.  However, I found that ROCKY BALBOA was my second cinematic surprise in a row (the first being CASINO ROYALE).  The surprise: ROCKY BALBOA is not the simply best ROCKY sequel - it's an excellent film as well.

There's a number of reasons for that.  The biggest, as I said before, is heart.  The film's got heart, and the man responsible for it all is Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is truly a wonder.  At sixty years old, he's in the best shape of his life (the guy is huge), he just cranked out an excellent ROCKY sequel (THE excellent ROCKY sequel), and he's about ready to begin production on the fourth RAMBO movie (a movie I'm highly anticipating).  Stallone's script for the movie is heartfelt and true to the spirit of the original film, and at times it's even quite clever; the ending is beautiful.  Stallone's directing is surprisingly classy, as is the gritty photography.  Longtime ROCKY fans may be pleased to learn that composer Bill Conti returns to the series for the first time since ROCKY III, and though most of the music is reused music from the original film, that's really all this movie needs.  One song in particular stands out.

That song is, of course, ""Gonna Fly Now"", the soaring anthem that has been the ultimate workout tune for thirty years.  It's used in the inevitable ""training montage"", a sequence that the series has never had a problem with making interesting and enjoyable.  This montage is especially inspirational: we haven't seen one of cinema's most beloved heroes in sixteen years, and suddenly he bursts on to the scene and benches about three-hundred pounds more than I'll ever be able to.  I really felt like I was gonna fly now during that scene, and I know I'm not alone.

Does ROCKY BALBOA have its flaws?  Sure.  It has the occasional laughable moment (particularly when Stallone mumbles something about dancing with bears), but for the most part Stallone knows when the film could wind up being hokey or silly or cliched and he avoids that.  The film is actually very funny intentionally, be it from Rocky's constant greeting of ""Yo, how you doin'?"" or a well-timed parody of the series' earlier entries.

In the final round, and this is undoubtedly the final round, ROCKY BALBOA is the sweetest kind of surprise.  It's like seeing an old friend for the first time in years and seeing that he not only is still alive and kicking - or, in this case, punching - but also that he's doing better than ever.  The directing, the acting, the screenwriting, it's all top-notch, and that's all because of heart.  Heart goes a long way, and thanks to the heart of Sylvester Stallone, as well as his woefully-neglected mind, ROCKY BALBOA is a knockout.",1168387200,10,4745,4.772058823529412
2743902,5,B000MRA58S,"I went to see this movie with a ""show me"" attitude.  Having seen all the Rocky movies I was certain that Sylvester Stallone was to old to cut the mustard.  Needless to say I left with the an entirely different feeling.  Rocky Balboa has not lost any exciting moves.  The movie was a true Rocky fast moving hard punching drama.  Yes, I was waiting for the theme song and Rocky to fly up those Philadelphia stairs.  Not disappointed in any aspects of this movie.  It was real, it was captivating, it was ROCKY at his best.",1168214400,5,520,4.354166666666667
2743903,3,B000MRA58S,"Sylvester Stallone seems to have made ""Rocky Balboa"" as a feature-length apology for every ""Rocky"" movie after the Oscar-winning original. It strains to be about a character and not the size of Stallone's oiled muscles.

""Rocky V"" treaded this ground, too, but crumbled under its overwhelming sentimentality. ""Rocky Balboa"" is a simpler creation, more of a meditation on aging than a boxing flick. I liked it. It's humble and sincere; Stallone seeks to give purpose to life after 50 but has stopped trying to butter up his own image. Rocky's not ending racism or slurring for an end to the Cold War. He's just a ""yo"" with an itch to box.

Because actress Talia Shire refused to return to the franchise, the storyline reveals that Rocky's wife, Adrian, has died from cancer. Rocky mourns weekly at her gravestone. And he's named a restaurant after her. It's a cozy place where Rocky can tell stories and nurse wounds. Somewhat estranged from his son (Milo Ventimiglia), Rocky spends hours haunting South Philadelphia with Paulie (Burt Young).

His routine changes when he runs into neighborhood girl Marie (Geraldine Hughes). Marie's a bit of a love interest, but more an opportunity for Rocky to reconnect with the outer world. Once he does, he senses a ""beast"" inside. It says, ""Box.""

And he'll get his shot in an exhibition against the heavyweight champion. Stallone makes this ridiculous scenario borderline plausible - just look at the state of boxing, and you have to admit it might happen - by integrating ESPN and HBO TV personalities into the screenplay.

The fight itself - against Mason ""The Line"" Dixon - is a schizophrenic mix of a HBO broadcast and ""Raging Bull"" choreography. But the rest of ""Rocky Balboa"" is crafted with restraint. Gone are the endless matching shots and music video editing from Stallone's earlier efforts. This is a decent and measured close to a series that deserved a little better",1168214400,3,1919,4.928792569659443
2743904,5,B000MRA58S,"As was the case for many Rocky fans, on first hearing of this new installment in the Rocky franchise I was very uncertain as to its affectiveness in advancing the story. However, I was completely wrong in my expectation of the film. Rocky Balboa is I think, the second best installment in the series, second only to the first film which exuded pasion, devotion, love, and the ideal of beliving in one-self despite the odds. Rocky Balboa, like the first film was an honest exploration of the human condition. It shows a man who had found and lost both the love of his life and professional success, but despite the apparent bleakness of his life is able with heart and the love and support of his family and friends to find happiness and peace of mind.

Way to go Mr. Stallone, you nailed this one on the head.

Rocky Balboa is a truely great movie experience and I recomend it to anyone and everyone, especially Rocky fans big and small.",1168214400,4,937,4.5058823529411764
2743905,5,B000MRA58S,"Sometimes I love being wrong.  Case in point: this film.  When I first heard that Stallone intended to make it I actually laughed, and thought to myself ""he's lost his bloody mind!""  I then pictured some comical scenes of an old man pounding a younger one into the mat and regaining his belt, tearing what few strands of believability that are left in the Rocky legend to shreds.

I was very, very wrong.  This movie is actually more realistic than any of the films, with the possible exception of the first.  Set in the decaying city of Philadelphia, an older, widowed Rocky runs a small restaurant called ""Adrian's.""  He is haunted by memories of his glorious past, and angry at how time and age have taken both his beloved wife and his fighting prowess.

At the same time we get a good look at the gentler side of the character, as he helps a struggling single mother and her son to survive, as well as others who have fallen on hard times, including an opponent from the first film, Spider Rico.

When the opportunity for the fight with the current champion comes along, there is no illusion that he will actually defeat the much younger man.  He wishes only to go the distance, and so close the circle that began when he first fought Apollo Creed 30 years previous.  Does he do it?  I won't tell.

There are no villains in this film.  Even his ring opponent is a noble person, an athlete/warrior who is disgusted by the lack of mettle in the current crop of fighters.  He treats Rocky respectfully, albeit with a condescending ""I'll go easy on you, pops"" attitude.

Rocky's son and Paulie are returning characters as well.  Paulie struggles with his own demons, especially his regrets over the way he once treated his sister.  Rocky, Jr. appears as a young man living in his dad's very large shadow, as he seeks to carve out a career in the business world.

Most touching of all is Rocky's continuing devotion to his beloved Adrian.  He visits her burial site often, bringing flowers, talking to her, or just sitting quietly beside the stone memorial in the cold and snow.

The ending is most satisfying, although I would have enjoyed more resolution regarding the struggles the characters were dealing with.  Does this leave the door open for yet another sequel?  I hope not.  The film was a magnificent way to end an often far-fetched but beautifully touching story.  Very highly recommended.",1168128000,12,2399,4.641330166270784
2743906,4,B000MRA58S,"There is no such thing as a ""has been"" when it comes to Rocky.  This movie was sentimental and very sad at times, and seeing him struggle with the loss of his beloved Adriane really tugged at the heartstrings.  The dialoge was REAL, filled with emotion as he tries to toughen up his son in the hard knocks that life can throw.  Through some flashbacks, we get to see Mickey (the late Burgess Meredith) and Adriane (Talia Shire) and this brought back some wonderful memories of the original ROCKY.  Though some reviewers thought the flashbacks were annoying, I actually felt they added to the film's sense of reminiscing since Rocky spends so much of his time trying to get a grip on the past and who he has become today.  Spending much of his time with his brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young) and adopting a shelter dog named Punchie, Rocky is such a lonely soul now, and you can't help but hope that he finds love again (with Little Marie) and can somehow put closure on his boxing career with this final exhibition fight.  Though being matched with heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (real life boxer, Antonio Tarver) is a bit unbelievable, it provided for some good Underdog cheering, and the inclusion of the ringside announcers from HBO's PPV line up added to the authentic feel of the fight.  I found myself really appreciating many of the lines in this film, especially when Rocky tells his son that, ""Somewhere along the line...you let other people tell you you're no good...if you know what you're worth, then go out and GET what you're worth...be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you're not where you want to be because of ""him"" or ""her"" or anybody.""  Good advice for anyone, especially in today's world where so many feel they're just never good enough, and find a way to lay blame everywhere but on themselves.

2743908,4,B000MRA58S,"There's a scene in the beginning of `Rocky Balboa' where I thought of Bruce Springsteen's famous song, ""Glory Days"".  Rocky has long since retired from boxing and has bought an Italian restaurant in Philly.  One night he's schmoozing with his guests from table to table.  He's enthusiastically telling his favorite stories in the ring when one guest cuts him off to finish the ending.  They've heard it all before.  And so have we.  In the Springsteen song, there's the punch line, ""...The time of glory...leaves you with nothing, Mister, but boring stories of...glory days.""  They weren't boring; it's just there's nothing new to tell.  The rest of the movie finds Rocky wanting to make new stories.  Seldom does `Rocky Balboa' seem like a sentimental reunion that only clings to the past.  Rather, the flashbacks melt well into the present day.  What we know goes well with what's new.

Adrianne has died and their son, Rocky, Jr. (Burt Young) has grown into a semi-successful white collar worker.  He's the apple of dad's eye, but Rocky's own ""glory days"" cast a shadow on his son.  He offers his son some philosophical words we can all take to heart:  ""It's not how hard you fight in life.  It's how hard you can take the punches...""  Rocky still has ties with Paulie (Burt Young) the one who lent him the meat locker.  His advice to Rocky is also sage:  ""You're living life backwards, Rocco...Change channels.""  So the aging Rocky clings to his memories of Adriane, pains after years of physical strain, and his reluctant retirement.  As one might guess, he gets a second chance.  I was so impressed with the development, I had to smile at how Sylvester Stallone pulled it off .

Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is that second chance.  A notorious champion, Dixon's a prima dona who doesn't give his opponents much of a chance.  (He reminds us of the contrast between growing up watching Ali and Frasier fight splendidly for free and today's debacles on Pay-per-view.)  Once opponents and a huge audience seem elusive, Dixon's promoters brainstorm an exhibition fight with Rocky, one that is meant to create interest, partly as a fund-raiser.  It also is meant to resolve ESPN's speculative computer simulation of two boxers from different eras match up.

With some effective scenes that warm up the heart between Paulie, an old acquaintance Marie (Geraldine Hughes), her grown son, Rocky's son--and the loving bond they share despite their differences--there's plenty of tender moments.  (And none of them stem from the meat locker.)  Then, they put on a fine show.  Plausible developments come to the fore in the ring where Stallone's stylish freeze-frame approach manages well with the poignant flashbacks, artfully done like none before in the 'Rocky' franchise.  'Rocky Balboa' offers many rounds of heartfelt entertainment and wisely ducks from any false sentimentality.",1167955200,3,2878,5.006329113924051

2743940,5,B000MRA58S,"Sylvester Stallone makes his way back to the Rocky series to redeem himself after the travesty that was Rocky 5.

It's a swan song movie, more touching and slow-moving drama than the rest, but it still packs a punch.

The movie starts with Rocky several years after his boxing career has ended. He's living alone as a result of his wife's passing, and he uses his daily hours taking care of the needs of his restaurant, named in honor of his late wife. For Rocky, however, just getting by is not enough, just going through life is not enough. The fire still burns within.

He slowly lets the news leak out to his son and Paulie that he'd like to fight again. Neither seems to receptive. Hell, even the Boxing Commission is against it. But then a computer generated fight in which Rocky KOs the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (played by real boxer Antonio Tarver), gets the wheels in motion for Rocky 5 (take two).

It's a joke of a fight, nobody expects Rocky to have a chance. Everyone is counting him out, even his family. Rocky still believes, and he proves his point, and his life's motto, by telling his son that life is not about how hard one can hit; but, instead, it's about how hard one can be hit, and keep moving forward.

The first half of the movie is a bit slow, building up the drama and tension. Eventually, however, the training montage takes place, and the actual fight ensues.

I can tell you this, if you at all root for  the underdog story or are a fan of the original, you will love this film. I go to movies periodically, usually waiting for the dvd or cable. I had to see this film, mostly out of curiousity, also to give the film a chance.

The film was stunning,  moving and Stallone, not the most versatile actor, was absolutely believable and touching as the lovable lug, saddened by the recent death of his wife and still mourning the loss, his decision to fight again, he still has some stuff in the basement to get rid of. The film moves beautifully, the fight scenes are like a HBO special, at times reminiscent of raging bull. little Marie(screw you creepo! first movie) was outstanding as the female (love interest?)in the movie and has some touching moments with the rock. Paul Young as Paulie, was great and also had some touching scenes with Stallone. Apollo Creeds trainer makes an appearance,  short scenes,  but is great in the role.

Rockys nemesis (Antonio Tarver)is also convincing as the underappreciated champion with something to prove. His scenes with his old trainer as his confidant, are very well done and convincing.

The Rocky series, has had its ups and downs,the last movie, was not a befitting end to the series. Stallone does a fitting tribute to one of the best movie stories ever told.

Stallone puts his all into the film, he looks absolutely amazing, he took this film seriously and went all out, I won't say its the best Rocky, but maybe I should!",1167177600,2,1665,4.560402684563758
2743946,3,B000MRA58S,"With the first Rocky film, we are introduced to a decidedly American character.  A true blue collar hero who inspires the quiet majority is certainly a great accomplishment.  Sylvester Stallone merely looks outside at the real world and reflects in his film the squalor and the near-squalor surrounding and pressuring his main character.  We watch as he struggles to be the right man for a woman.  He struggles with his dreams and feelings of inadequacy, and through it all, we connect with him emotionally and we subsequently celebrate his victories.

The second film is essentially a director's extension to the first film, and it continues and concludes much more storyline than Stallone probably intended.  Stallone is so complete with the first Rocky movies that the third, fourth, and fifth movies have nowhere believable to begin, and it's painful to watch Stallone brutalize a character that he worked so hard to build.

Rocky Balboa is interesting to me because it shows how poor and unnecessary the third, fourth, and fifth Rocky films really are.  There's no need for Rocky to overcome the overly racial-ized Clubber Lang in Rocky III, or the Cold War Russian in Rocky IV.  By far the worst of the series, Rocky V nearly obliterates everything human about Rocky Balboa, turning him into a selfish jerk; he's always self-centered, but only in Rocky V does he make that unsympathetic turn into selfishness.

But with this final chapter, Stallone has attempted to own the mistakes of his Rocky series as well as finally write a conclusion worthy of the character he created 30 years ago.  Yes, the older Rocky lectures to us in clichs and he tells us ""something [we] already know,"" but he does it in a manner that is believable and insightful within the context of the character.  Stallone has rendered a good sense of desperation and pain for his older Rocky.  It's likely Stallone himself is going through these very same feelings as he ages and looks back at some mistakes and missteps in his career as well as the moments of greatness.

My uncle is 50 years old and in fantastic shape.  After seeing the film with his kids, he thought the film didn't have enough action and that it was more about thinking and feeling than the Rocky he knows.  His description of the film is accurate, but I'm not sure what else one can expect from Stallone.  Stallone is 60 years old and in great, great shape for his age.  He gives as good a physical display as possible in this final film, and he does not appear broken or apologetic because of his age.  There are few movies out there that actually respect the aging and the elderly.  Stallone has found a way.

It's also great to see Rocky continue to learn and not settle on old prejudices.  This struggle may be even more difficult than the physical challenges of the film.  Stallone displays a matured tenderness in a Platonic relationship with a younger woman that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciated the gesture.  Stallone seems to have touched on nearly everything in the Rocky world, tying up loose ends, finishing things.  Rocky Balboa could easily have been the conclusion to a trilogy instead of a disclaimer about what Stallone meant to say.

In the end, the film works for me.  Despite being sentimental, I actually believed Stallone's older Rocky, mostly because it's clear that Stallone believes what he's saying and doing in this film.  Better late than never.",1167091200,7,3427,4.792163543441227
2743947,5,B000MRA58S,"Never underestimate Stallone.  The mere appearance of this film is proof of a determination and drive that only Balboa himself can match...but they're the same guy, literally.

I'm sure film theorists may have something to say about Balboa/Stallone, however the Great Man must be credited with pulling off a successful sequel, by previous sequel standards.  The abysmal V and the ridiculous IV wash away as Stallone returns to...Part I to bring the whole thing together.  Back in his old 'hood, hat on head, hitting sides of beef, running up the museum steps, talking about getting hit and still going, feeding his turtles, being a lovable palooka, it's all here.

You know what the story is about, if not, go read one of the other 800 reviews.  Balboa wants to get back in the ring, bottom line.  He's old.  He's an underdog.  He's insane.  But he wants to do it...so he does it.  Ditto Stallone.  It took many years of struggle and a different studio to put together this relatively low budget sequel that will make a nice chunk of change when all is said and done.  Stallone brings back everybody, even Adrian in flashbacks, and even Duke, who appears to have filmed only a trailer, to once again stand in the big guy's corner as he battles a superior opponent.

The brain damage of Part V is not mentioned, but no matter.  They just disregard it.  Rocky at 60 getting into the ring with the champ?  Hey, it can happen.  Stallone got into tremendous physical shape for the film, and he's 60, so there.  Anything can happen when Sly puts his mind to it.

You either accept that Stallone is out of his mind and move on and enjoy what is a good sequel and better than half of them, or avoid it.",1167091200,2,1694,4.528052805280528

Here he courts (in the non-standard way) a young woman resembling Adrian, takes her son under his wing, and even (hold on to something) manages to grow as a character.

The training and fight scenes are minimal, but when they take place, they reach catharthic heights of glee not seen since Rocky III.  Rocky Balboa is a unique film in this day and age-a meaningful film.",1167091200,,672,4.868421052631579

This film seems to throw out the brain damaged angle of part 5.  Rocky is still a bit punchy, but loveable.  He owns a small resturaunt in Philly.  Paula is back at the meat packing place, Adrian has died of cancer and Rocky has trouble letting go.  His son has trouble living in the shadow of a legend.  When current champ Mason ""the line"" Dixon loses a computerized fight between former champ Rocky and himself, his handlers come up with an exhibition bout which Rocky takes to help move on in life and close a chapter.  The world and Dixon think the match is a joke, but this is Rocky we are talking about.  Very entertaining movie with more ties to the first film than any that followed.

2743970,5,B000MRA58S,"What do we mean by [i]transcendant [/i] art of the story-telling variety, ie books or movies? I think it is fair to say that this sort of real art moves us deeply, transcending the actual subject matter and  strongly touches us personally at a universal human level. Was  The Old Man and The Sea only about fishing? Was Moby Dick about simply whaling? Was The Magnificent Seven about 7 gunslingers on a job? Was Showgirls  only about nude dancing? Ok. Bad example. But you get the point.

As a prime example of such art, I commend to you the new movie Rocky Balboa. Like everyone else, I was sort of disdainful of Stallone cranking out another Rocky movie. I was wrong. And if you don't do yourself the great favor of seeing it now on the Big Screen, you will be, too. It is more than great entertainment; it is art. Transcendant art. The best in the series. The best. And it is not really about boxing.

Rocky Balboa has carved himself a nice life since his career in the ring ended. He has a nice successful restaurant. Upscale clientelle. he's an icon. People greet him on the street,wanting to have their pictures taken with him. He wears an expensive sport coat to work. He speaks well, looks good, has friends of all sorts and money in the bank. And yet..and yet..

Adrienne is gone, of cancer three years ago. He goes to her grave and walks where they walked, remembering. His son is estranged from him, overshadowed by his famous father and blaming his dad for it. And Rocky tells stories to his restaurant patrons of the old days while signing autographs and posing for photos. Is this The Italian Stallion? There is still fire within. And one way to let it out. Fighters fight. He applies for a boxing license. Passes all tests with flying colors. And gets turned down. The insight that Stallone brings to this script which he wrote, his heartfelt speech to the Licensing board and later his son and"" Paulie""  are the real knockouts in the film. He gets his license, planning on some minor fights. But it isn't going to be that way.

When a computer simulated fight predicts that Rocky in his 1970s prime would defeat current undefeated heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver,genune light-heavyweight champion and top pound-for-pound fighter at the time), an exhibiition fight is arranged. Dixon at first  expects to ""carry"" Rocky, much as Jumbo Collins carried Joe Frazier when Smokin' Joe came out of reitrement and had nothing left. But as boxing pundits continue to say that Dixon isn't what Rocky was, as he is dissed, as Rocky gets the pre-fight applause and press, you can see Antonio Taver getting more and more irritated. And when Balboa tells Tarver ""I didn't come here to lose"", you know it ain't gonna be no friendly exhibition.

Technically, the film is amazing. The fight scenes, video and real, feel authentic. Real referee,real announcer, real commentators, Mike Tyson ringside  screaming that the champion is ducking him. The editing is great. It IS an HBO PPV fight. There are several muted almost hidden, images that will reverberate with fans of the earlier films. And Tarver at the peak of his form has that great long jab and crushing left cross (he is a southpaw) that won him the real title.

This film is not about boxing. It is about getting older, about loss, about digging down, about being true to yourself, about love and kids and redemption. [...].

It is more than a movie. Written, directed and starring Sylvester Stallone. It is transcendant art. And The Best Picture of the Year. Maybe any year.

2743971,5,B000MRA58S,"Before viewing ""Rocky Balboa,"" I was hearing mixed comments including ""this is the best Rocky ever"" to jibes about ""how realistic could this movie be?""

I must say that Stallone did a fine job of keeping it ""fairly real"" and perhaps, most importantly, wrapping up the ""Rocky"" series.

Rocky V was slightly disappointing simply because there was no real conclusion - unless you knew for certain another Rocky installment was on its way. You found yourself asking ""what happens next?""

 ""Rocky Balboa"" gives us a sense of closure and perhaps that in itself makes it real. We learn that Rocky has been running his late wife's restaurant in recent years and that he is actually seeking some kind of closure (personally and professionally.) As he states to Paulie, he still has ""some stuff in the basement.""

His final boxing match leaves no false illusions - he is not a fast young man anymore. But Rocky still has heart, strength, and is still able to go the distance.

Another interesting point: Many of the original Rocky sidekick characters are back and while that might seem contrived, Stallone actually makes it work to the story's advantage. By bringing ""Little Marie"" back as Stallone did, you get a sense that many of Rocky's cronies stayed in the hood and it was only a matter of time before they all reconnected again.

I don't know if I'll say this was, by far, the best Rocky. It was, by far, the best way to complete the Rocky series.",1167091200,,1444,4.683794466403162

2743974,5,B000MRA58S,"""Rocky Balboa"" is wonderful, and a ""must-see"" film for those who liked any of the earlier ""Rocky"" movies.  Sylvester Stallone has underscored once again that he is an enormous talent.

Burt Young as ""Paulie"" is terrific as always; and Talia Shire as ""Adrian"" is missing, but her spirit is present throughout the movie and undergirds it.  If anyone could fill the void left by her absence, it is Geraldine Hughes as ""Marie,"" who is a lovely Irish lass, and is the perfect counterpoint to Sly.

The photography is excellent; it is beautifully filmed, with wonderful flashbacks; and it is much more complicated and sophisticated than the earlier ""Rocky"" movies.  The casting is terrific, especially in the scenes set in Philadelphia.  Stallone was right to have chosen Antonio Tarver, who does a fine job as the fighter ""Mason Dixon.""  The fight scenes are very well staged--and photographed--even more so than the previous films.

At one point, Paulie asks Rocky whether he's ""peaked yet?""  Perhaps the essence of the ""Rocky"" films is that none of us has peaked, ever, and that each of us marches to a different drummer.  Just when they say and believe that we can't do it, we say or believe that we can, and we attempt to do what few would conceive of doing.

We challenge norms and sacred cows and status quos, and this life has meaning because we do it.  That is what ""Rocky"" has been about since the first film, and Sly Stallone has mastered the art in this one, truly mastered it.  He is great--there is no other adjective to describe him.

And yes, there is a Bill of Rights and Americans do have rights--as Rocky observes--despite the fact that hack judges (who should be removed from the bench) and mean-spirited prosecutors (who should be disbarred) and politicians routinely ignore them and trample on them and spit on them daily throughout this great country.

In short, ""Rocky Balboa"" has something for everyone, and it is a story that should go on forever, even though Stallone has said that this is his last ""Rocky"" film.  But Sly, we're just getting to know ""Rocky.""  And physically, all of us should look as good as Sly Stallone!

2743975,4,B000MRA58S,"Twenty seven years after his first championship fight, Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa is just living his life as a normal guy.  His wife, Adrian, is dead and he visits her grave regularly.  He hangs out with his brother-in-law, Paulie, and goes to places that remind him of his and Adrian's courtship.  He runs a restaurant, Adrian's, and walks around during dinner reliving the glory days of his fighting years with customers who like the sentimentality of it. And he's struggling to maintain a relationship with his son, whose friends call him ""Little Rocky"" and who desperately wants to shake off his image as Rocky Balboa's son and make a name for himself.

The current undisputed heavyweight champion of the world is a man named Mason Dixon.  Dixon is fast, quick, and youg, but people doubt his talent because he's never really fought anyone who would prove much of a threat.  Since his victories don't seem to be much of a challenge, everyone wonders if Dixon really is worth his salt as a boxer. Then ESPN has the bright idea of staging a computer-simulated a fight between Rocky Balboa at his prime and Mason Dixon right now. This is supposed to mirror a similar fight that was once similated between Rocky Marciano and Muhammed Ali.  In this version, Balboa wins. Angered, Dixon challenges Rocky to an exhibition fight to go 10 rounds and to prove once and for all who really is the greatest.

I have to say that in order to like this movie you have to be a fan of the original Rocky franchise. I went with one friend who, like me, was a die hard Rocky fan and another who couldn't care less. Whether or not we liked the original films was reflected in the split decision between who liked and who didn't like Rocky Balboa.  This movie was a tad bit melodramatic, but all the Rocky movies are and if you're a fan you'd know that going into it.  Regardless of whether you like the old films or not, I'd suggest rewatching the original Rocky from 1979 before going to see this movie. It's  not really necessary to see any of the sequels, but there are a lot of flashbacks and clips from the first film and I think seeing it beforehand will help put them into perspective.  Even as a longtime fan of the Rocky series, if I hadn't watched the original within the last week I'm pretty sure there were parts of this one that would have been lost on me.

Still, as a whole, I really enjoyed this movie. It focuses a lot on Rocky's efforts to rebuild his life in the aftermath of Adrian's death.  You can tell that since she's been gone he hasn't really known what to do with himself. Going back into the ring with Dixon is his way of exorcising the demon's that have been haunting him since her death. It also allows him to get back his relationship with his son and to finally bury the past so that he can go on with his future. Melodramatic it may be, but I love Rocky and this is a fitting end to the series.",1166918400,5,2915,4.424299065420561
2743976,4,B000MRA58S,"""Rocky Balboa"" can be viewed in two distinct ways: it's either an unoriginal film that reuses all the best elements from the original ""Rocky""; or it's a well-crafted film that respectfully pays tribute to its origins while telling a new and compelling story. For whatever it's worth, I tend to favor the latter interpretation. While it isn't perfect, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. It's a heartfelt story written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, one that manages to steer clear of becoming sappy, preachy, or melodramatic. Yes, the climactic fight scene is also entertaining, but it's nowhere near as important as what takes place early on. Just like the original 1976 film, this is not a story about boxing; it's about amounting to something amidst the realities of everyday living. Stallone created an underdog character, representing the everyman who wanted a chance at greatness.

In some ways, these underlying themes take on even greater significance than when they were presented thirty years ago. Still living in Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is now an aging restaurant owner. Consumed with remorse over the death of his beloved Adrian, he begins to wonder whether or not he still has what it takes to get through life. It's apparent on the anniversary of her death that he needs to go in a different direction; not only does he visit her grave, he and Paulie (Burt Young)--Adrian's brother--also visit all the spots where Adrian and Balboa were together. They stop by the pet store where she and Balboa looked at birds. They stand on the stoop of Balboa's home, where he envisions her as she once appeared. They even visit the vacant lot of the now demolished ice skating rink. When at this location, Paulie loses himself, feeling as if he has no right to remind himself of his sister (who he treated badly).

His last stop is a sleazy little bar, where he meets the local bartender, Marie (Geraldine Hughes). As it turns out, she's the same Marie that Balboa walked home thirty years ago, back when she was just a young girl (""Screw you, creepo!"" were her final words to him). They immediately strike up a friendship, made stronger with the introduction of her son, nicknamed Steps (James Francis Kelly III). For whatever reason, they motivate Balboa into random acts of kindness, such as employing them both for his restaurant. While Marie is certainly grateful, she has a hard time understanding why he's being so generous. ""You don't owe us nothing,"" she says one night as Balboa replaces the bulb of her porch light. ""Why do you have to owe something to get something?"" is his simple yet significant reply. This scene worked especially well because so much was being said with so few words; a lot of this film works on that level (it made me think twice about criticizing Stallone's overly-colloquial writing style).

Other relationships highlight the story, such as that between Balboa and his son, Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who has gone on to become a suit-wearing paper pusher in a wealthy Philadelphia high rise. When making a surprise visit, Balboa sees his son's boss acting belligerently, suggesting that his son is willing to let people step all over him. He clearly has some issues, always feeling as if he's lived in the shadow of his famous father. Now it seems as if Rocky, Jr. is unwilling to visit the family restaurant, opting instead to go out for drinks with his friends. During one such outing, the bar's television is tuned in to the sports channel, where a computer-simulated match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fought. Of course, the animated Balboa wins.

But when the real Balboa hears of this ""victory,"" thoughts of actually entering the ring one last time begin floating through his head. Consider the fact that at his restaurant, he goes from table to table, telling his guests stories about his past fights; is this not indicative of someone who still has something to prove? His son seems to think so, and the feelings only get stronger when Balboa decides to go through with it. Rocky, Jr. is initially unwilling to support his father, who he thinks will only succeed in embarrassing them both. The sports world doesn't hold out much hope, either; Balboa will be up against Dixon, who's younger, faster, and more athletic. But Balboa is determined to do what he feels is the right thing.

Thus begins the obligatory montage training sequence, set against Bill Conte's famous score. Just like in the first film, Balboa runs through the city in a gray sweat suit. He punches sides of beef in Paulie's slaughterhouse. There are even some brief shots of him chugging a glassful of raw eggs. (I can't say whether or not this scene was written to appease fans of the original film. I suppose it doesn't really matter; if a film's plot centers on an impending boxing match, training footage is a necessary component.)

I won't bother describing anything about the final fight scene in Las Vegas; because the entire film builds up to it, you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that, to a degree, I questioned the plausibility of it, especially in terms of Dixon's involvement. He's an undefeated champion boxer, yet he's not respected in the sports community, labeled as someone who only picks easy opponents. I also got the impression that he genuinely respects Balboa, despite offering a way for him to be defeated without embarrassment. He comes to believe that his managers are only interested in the financial success of the fight, and that made me wonder why he would actually want to be in the ring at all; such a hollowly conceived boxing match cannot be easily dismissed.

Nonetheless, the ending of ""Rocky Balboa"" is appropriate. It helps that the fight scene in and of itself does not represent the soul of the film; as I said before, this is not a story about boxing. At one point, Balboa says something to effect of, ""It's not about whether or not you get hit, but about how hard you can be hit and get back up."" It may be a cliche statement, but there's no denying that it rings true. Is this film better than the original ""Rocky""? Of course not. Nothing ever will be better than that. But is it a worthy final chapter to the film series? Absolutely.",1166832000,4,6294,4.811460258780037
2743977,4,B000MRA58S,"When the original ROCKY debued in 1976, audiences were entranced more by the man outside the ring than the fighter inside it. Sylvester Stallone played Rocky as a man who had frailties mixed in with his swatting power. We cared about him, perhaps even more so when he lost a close decision to Apollo Creed.  In the four sequels, Stallone gradually placed more emphasis on a storyline played by the numbers.  We still enjoyed his Rocky character, even if he slowly left his source of interest, his appealing mixture of inner fears masked by an indomitable will.

In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone comes full circle.  Both are pushing sixty, far past the age of an action star.  We can see lines in Rocky's face that are probably not the result of makeup. But what we do not see is a ridiculous figure of a man who keeps coming to a dance when he no longer can move.  We see him as a man of immense dignity, content to play greeter to patrons in his restaurant, but still grieving over the loss of his wife Adrian.  We see him embroiled in a number of relating issues. He has a son who seeks to escape the long shadow of an imposing father.  He meets Marie, a now much more mature woman whom Rocky told to give up smoking in the original ROCKY.  He meets her son with whom he tries to have the sort of relation that he cannot have with his own son.  But this is after all a ROCKY movie, and these relationships have a built in limitation.  Rocky knows there can be no romance with Marie, not with the ghost of Adrian still fresh.  Her son floats ephemerally in and out of the picture.  Rocky's son is a walk-on as well.  The focus is on Rocky being yanked out of retirement to have an exhibition match against Mason Dixon, well played by real life boxer Antonio Tarver.

Those who find fault with ROCKY BALBOA tend to emphasize the film's admitted faults.  In an exhibition fight, the limit would be six rounds with headgear.  Mason Dixon has been blamed for being a puerile version of Clubber Lang, from ROCKY III.  Yet, Tarver is convincing as a man who has his own demons.  It is hardly his fault that he, like an earlier Rocky, has run out of worthy contenders. Tarver plays Dixon as a fighter who seeks his own place in the boxing pantheon. And against Balboa, Dixon finds a worthy if elderly opponent against whom he may measure his own greatness.

What emerges in ROCKY BALBOA is a film that combines the best of themes that look back to past glories and places them in the context of how those glories can fit in against a man whose only glory is to dance one more time against the Astaire of the ring.  ROCKY BALBOA is a worthwhile coda for Stallone to bring to a satisfying end the saga of a club fighter who can yet entertain us even after nearly three decades.",1166832000,2,2762,4.35546875

2743999,5,B000MRA58S,"At the surface, this film is simply nothing more than a Rocky film, a fitting end to one of the best sagas in film history. Then, after you see the film, you start to see and appreciate the film's depth - just as was the case with the Oscar-winning original.

The film is not about boxing, so much as some of its weaker predecessors, it's about believing in yourself, staying true to who you are, and never giving up hope.

Rocky Balboa, who now is running his own Italian restaurant aptly called Adrian's, is struggling to find his true place in life after he hangs up his gloves. As he has said many times in previous films - ""I'm a fighter."" It's all he knows and it's all he wants to do, and as a result Rocky is a bit of a lost soul, seeking meaning and happiness. But what happens when he gets one last opportunity, one last shot at glory?

A heart-warming movie that will have you cheering from start to finish. A nice touch is that we are once again reconnected with several characters that truly bring the series full circle and return it to its roots - from little ""Screw You Creepo"" Marie to Spider Rico, the same man that Rocky fought in the opening sequence of the first film.

Another interesting note about this film is the way that the antagonist, Mason Dixon, was portrayed. He is not a villain, an opponent we are supposed to hate just because he is fighting Rocky, a la Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago. Instead, he too is a man struggling to find his own way and to overcome his own adversity as well.

This movie is obviously a must-see for any fan of the series, but it's a must see for any movie fan who needs a reason to believe in the power of the human heart.",1166832000,2,1680,4.253918495297806

I absolutely loved the first four Rocky films, so don't take me for a Rocky hater, I'm far from one. But Rocky Balboa is not a good film. The pacing is slow and boring, the story is way past played out and the final fight scene contains the least amount of actual ""fighting"" that I have ever seen in a Rocky film. Antonio Tarver is the worst ""villain"" as he is basically devoid of any emotion in this film. There is no real beef between him and Rocky. On the whole the story line is utterly ridiculous and even though I tried to tell myself that this is just a movie, I still couldn't get past some of the nonsense. For instance, in this ""exhibition"" match for charity, if one of these men were knocked down twice in one round the fight would have been stopped. No exhibition fight would ever go the distance with it's participants cut and bleeding. So be prepared to suspend your belief in reality for the 1:42 minute running time of this film. It's clear that Stallone was unhappy with the way the series was ended (Rocky V was an utter train wreck), so he has basically come back to finish the series with some class and dignity. The question is...who cares? Some people will I'm sure, but I guess I'm way past the point of caring. Recommended only to hardcore Rocky fanatics.",1166832000,7,1500,4.360714285714286
2744001,4,B000MRA58S,"""Rocky Balboa"" AKA, ""Rocky VI"" will not be the greatest inspirational sports movie you see. Its grandfather, the original ""Rocky"" could argue for that spot. In fact, it might own it. However, no one should compare this to the first Rocky. It is a fun, inspiring movie for 2006, and will be a worthy addition to the sports movie pantheon.

4.5 stars for this one.

""Rocky Balboa"" is, itself, the great underdog. Critics see it as another installment in the descending and embarrassing series, or, are calling it the best 'Rocky' sequel. Because of the two extremes Stallone has presented us, from one of the best movies ever to some of the dogs of cinema, expectations are low. With expectations across the board, I saw this and was pleasantly surprised.

Rocky Balboa, circa 2006, is a retired boxer approaching 60. People in town generally give him respect, and space. He is no longer hounded by the media, and no longer chased by his fans. Philadelphia has moved on. They even took down his statue.

Now, he runs a midlevel Italian restaurant, and wanders from table to table telling about the good old days. Customers get a meal and a story, and Rocky gets his mortgage paid.

His son begrudges his dad for the big shadow. Imagine being Michael Jordan's kid? Such is what Rocky, Jr. must endure, and he wants to be his man. He pushes his dad away in the process. Rocky's conversation with his son outside the restaurant will be ranked among the great movie speeches, and will be quoted everywhere from church sermons to business books to locker rooms.

Meanwhile, Rocky is looking for meaning. Like Willy Loman, he wants the older years of his life to matter, and like Loman, he keeps looking to the past to find that meaning. Regular visits to Adrian's grave, autographs in his restaurant, and walks through his old neighborhood remind him of who he used to be. Who is he now?

He feeds a needy old opponent of his, helps a single woman and her son with friendship and jobs. He recognizes that life should be lived on his terms, just as he always has. But what are his terms?

When reigning champ Mason Dixon, a mix of rap star arrogance and Mike Tyson dominance, wants to fight, Rocky sees it as similar to the opportunity Apollo Creed gave him decades earlier. He's a fool, naturally. The match ""will against skill"" is respectful that Rocky's will power is bar none, but he isn't 25.

Like the other Rocky movies, good and bad, this is a family film. No profanity, sex, or the usual Hollywood movie gimmicks to kick it into PG-13 or up rating. It's clean, hard-charging, and packed with the message the other movies carried: ""All about: pride, reputation, and not being another bum in the neighborhood.""

The movie needs another 10-15 minutes to wrap up some storylines, and some of the lines are cheesy. Dixon's desire to be tested, Spider's reasons for being out of work, and Rocky's friendship to Steps need clearing up. The movie hangs on, but viewers might be left unsatisfied. Rocky makes one monologue too many about continuing to fight and never be beaten, but not so much that it becomes polemic.

I fully recommend ""Rocky Balboa.""

2744003,4,B000MRA58S,"As with many, I had very low expectatioins when I heard about ""Rocky Balboa"", the 6th chapter in the classic series about the underdog boxer from Philadelphia turned heavyweight champ.  Given how awful the latest previous installment, Rocky V, was and that Sylvester Stallone is likely on medicare by now, my basic reaction to the prospect of another Rocky movie was that it sounded like a complete joke.

To tell the truth, the only reason I decided to go to see Rocky Balboa was because a friend (who is a self-proclaimed ""Rocky Freak"") had insisted on taking me.  I looked at some of the critics' reviews before leaving, and I was very pleasantly suprised to see that Richard Roeper had given it a 3.5/4 rating.  This left me very optimistic walking into the movie theater, and I was not disappointed.  The film was a fitting final chapter in the legacy of an iconic American series, and certainly filled the bitter void that Rocky V left behind.  Rocky went out with pride, not embarassment.  That was supposedly Stallone's reason for making the movie.

The plot centers around a long retired Rocky Balboa.  In the opening of the film, we see Rocky sitting at the grave site of his beloved wife Adrian, who had passed away in 2002.  It is rumored that the character was killed off because the actress who portrayed her, Talia Shire, refused to take part in the film because she felt it would be a major box office flop.  Whatever the reason, it is clear that Rocky misses her terribly, and we see him with his brother-in-law Paulie touring Philadelphia sites that reminded Rocky of his life with Adrian.  It is a very painful experience for Paulie, however, because he regrets that he did not treat Adrian very well.

After this tour, Rocky goes to the Lucky Seven Tavern where he and his old trainer Mickey used to drink together.  There he meets a woman bartender who seems to know him.  Rocky doesn't remember, but the woman informs him that she was ""Little Marie"", a troublemaking minor character who made a cameo appearence in the original film, in which Rocky pleads that she quit smoking, only to recieve the response ""Screw you, creapo!"".  She introduces him to her child, Stephenson (aka ""Steps"") whom Rocky gives a job to at the Resuraunt he now owns in Philadelphia.

Rocky clearly is feeling emptiness at this point in his life, but he would find himself in the spotlight again soon enough.  In a nationally televised episode of ESPN's SportsCenter, Rocky (in his prime) is put up against current (hated) heavyweight champion Mason Dixon (played by real-life boxer Antonio Tarver) in a computer simulated fight.  Rocky emerges victorious, though many ESPN commentators disagree with this result.

This prompts Rocky to consider fighting again. When he tells his son of this, he thinks Rocky is crazy, and the Pennsylvania Athletic Commision refused him a boxing license.  However, Rocky pursuades them to change their minds after a very passionate speech about every American's ""right to pursue happiness"".

Much to Rocky's suprise, Mason Dixon challenges him to an exhibition match to capitalize on the publicity of ESPN's simulated fight in an attempt to improve his image.  Rocky is reluctant to accept the offer, and explains that he was only interested in local ameture tournaments and not in ""getting mangled and embarrased"".  However, after much thought and encouragment from ""Little Marie"", Rocky decides to accept the challenge.  What followed was a classic and inspirational underdog story of hard work and dedication.  But would it pay off? Well, I won't ruin the movie for you. I'll just say that the ending is fairly realistic, but leaves everybody satisified.

I think that Rocky Balboa is probably the best Rocky film since Rocky II in 1980, because it really brings back the ""pull for the underdog"" spirit of the first two films.  While Rocky III and Rocky IV were fairly enjoyable, they didn't capture the same spirit because Rocky wasn't really the underdog anymore.  In this way, I think it's good that Stallone waited so long to release Rocky Balboa.  Just like the fight that that it centers around, against all odds, the film comes out triumphant.",1166745600,3,4185,4.870056497175141
2744004,5,B000MRA58S,Surprisingly great movie! Very similar in nature to the first Rocky. I say that this movie is right up there with the first one in terms of enjoyment. Go see it!!!!!!!,1166745600,,167,4.419354838709677
2744005,4,B000MRA58S,"In 1976, an unknown and struggling actor named Sylvester Stallone wrote an underdog boxing fable and somehow convinced the powers that be to allow him to be cast in the starring role. The success of the film (modest box office hit, Oscar wins for Best Movie and Directing) garnered four sequels of varying quality before the franchise was put in hiatus for 17 years. But, now, at last, the 60-year-old Stallone, feeling his oats again and desiring one last hurrah, brings to a close the Rocky Balboa saga.

SPOILERS and a few boxing trivia follow here: If you're any sort of boxing fan, then you know that the heavyweight class has been in steady decline for a number of years now; it's just been fairly recently that Wladimir Klitschko has been imposing his dominance over the sundry contenders/pretenders. ROCKY BALBOA borrows from the real-life lack of an undisputed, linear heavyweight champ and transposes it somewhat onto its movie premise. In the plot, undefeated and current heavyweight champion Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (real life light heavyweight pugilist Antonio Tarver) has been knocking out his opponents for a while now but, because of the lack of depth in his weight class and the absence of a fighter who could truly test him, he's considered to be a dubious champion by fans and boxing pundits. Even an ESPN computer simulation refuses to show him respect as it pits him versus a past champion in Rocky Balboa; to add insult to injury, the computer even has Balboa knocking out Dixon. Dixon's manager, who is well aware of his client's prevailing unpopularity, hits on the idea of putting on an exhibition match between Dixon (33 wins, 0 losses, 30 knockouts) and Rocky Balboa (57 wins, 22 losses, 28 knockouts). And, speaking of Rocky...

With the loss of his wife and anchor, Adrian, to cancer, ex-prizefighter Rocky Balboa, now 58 years in age, has basically been just drifting. He spends much of his time missing Adrian and, every year, on the anniversary of her passing, he frequents their old hangouts, much to the distress and disgust of his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young), who is as unpolitically correct and irascible as ever. Rocky owns and runs Adrian's, a nice, little Italian restaurant, and amuses the customers by regaling them with his fight experiences and accomodating them with photo ops. When Rocky catches a glimpse of the same virtual match on ESPN, his aged motor gets going; he begins to mull over the idea of re-entering the ring and fighting in small, local bouts. Somehow, against everyone's wishes (including and especially his overshadowed son, Robert), he's even granted a boxing license. Dixon's manager and promoter approach him with the offer to fight a 10-round exhibition bout (but with no protective gear) with the current champ; this  challenge proves to be too much for Rocky to resist as he still harbors a ""beast"" inside of him.

The rest of the movie goes on to depict the by now expected montage of training sessions - including the traditional sprint up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art - and culminates in the highly anticipated match, where Rocky is considered a massive underdog. Even with the fans solidly behind him and chanting out his name, Rocky is hard pressed to beat a champion who's reigning and defending his crown in the prime of his life. In the end, as usual, it goes down to heart, as Mason Dixon finally finds the defining test he's been looking for and Rocky seeks to tame the savage beast within him one final time. I won't say who wins, but let me put it this way: Rocky exits on his own terms.

Rocky Balboa is, without a doubt, the quintessential underdog, and, obviously, is one of the most universally beloved cinematic creations of our time. The city of Philadelphia has taken the Rocky character on as one of its very own citizens. Rocky, for 30 years now, has simply resonated within the souls of the populace and it's easy to see why. The man isn't too bright, though he does have a certain street savvy and has become wiser over the years. He's innately lovable - a big palooka who works hard and is intrinsically true to himself. He's very rootable. In ROCKY BALBOA, Stallone returns his iconic character to his roots, the seamy neighborhoods of Philly peopled with blue-collared Joes. This film is predominantly a series of low key character-driven scenes, one after the other, punched up, every now and then, by Balboa's occasional impassioned speeches (you could see Sly straining for the Oscar), until the big, showy brawl at the end. We get to hear and ponder Rocky's gravelly, ineloquently vocalized homespun philosophies and realize that, while Rocky's no brain surgeon, he's smart enough to know what matters most in life, a nugget of wisdom he imparts to his unfulfilled and whiny son, as played annoyingly by the plastically smouldering Milo Ventimiglia (who also isn't exactly my most favorite character in HEROES), whose turnaround to his father's side happens too rapidly for my taste. Yes, the pace is deliberate and, at times, threatens to plod. A lot of the flashbacks shown in the first half hour will certainly test the patience of folks unaware of the Rocky history. I even found some of the old clips too much to take as I wanted the movie to advance already. But, in the end, Sly knew what he was doing as these quiet moments do serve to make Rocky's last time in the ring heartachingly more resonant.

The other actors aren't shabby. Burt Young inhabits Paulie from such a deep, personal place that I really can't picture him in any other kind of role. Antonio Tarver (who, by the by, after this movie, went on to decisively lose his very next bout to the elderly, blown-up heavyweight Bernard Hopkins) is decent enough as Rocky's boxing foil, although the script doesn't really call for him to stretch as an actor. Geraldine Hughes takes over Jodi Letizia's role as Little Marie, who reappears after 30 years. Little Marie was the girl who told Rocky, ""Screw you, creepo!"" after he walked her safely home; this time, she has more of an integral role to play. Marie, apparently, didn't listen to Rocky's advise from way back and has become a single mom with very low self-esteem. We'll never know if a romance will develop between her and Rocky but we are assured of a blooming friendship between the two. Hughes' deft portrayal of the wounded Marie makes you wish good things to happen for her. Unfortunately, not much can be said of the actor who plays her son, Steps, as the audience never really gets a chance to know him.

It was nice to see actual folks in the flick who are major players in the world of boxing. Credibility is lent with the appearances of ESPN's Brian Kenny (who's had his own verbal battles with Floyd Mayweather, Jr.), the HBO boxing commentary crew (Jim Lampley, Larry Merchant, Max Kellerman), announcer Michael Buffer (""Let's get ready to rumble!""), ref Joe Cortez (who really does say ""Remember, guys, I'm fair but I'm firm""), promoter Lou Dibella, and the cigar toting boxing historian Bert Sugar.

Of course, this movie ain't perfect. The plot tends to drag at times, not enough time is spent working on Mason Dixon's character (although his relationship with his former trainer proves to be surprisingly touching), and I find it vexing that not one mention is made about the brain damage Rocky incurred in ROCKY V.

So is ROCKY BALBOA as good as the first ROCKY? No, not by a mile. But, while it doesn't live up to my high expectations, it certainly contains enough graceful moments which affected me at a deep enough gut level that I can honestly recommend it. Needless to say, this movie is best experienced in a rambunctiously crowded theater with folks who are all in the know about the Rocky films. I guarantee you ROCKY BALBOA'll serve up a nice, warm slug of nostalgia. Like I said, the movie's pace is leisurely so take the time to savor the scenes as there won't be any more after this. ROCKY BALBOA is a fitting capper to what has been an iconic film series. By the way, in an interview on a radio sports show, Stallone made mention that he would like another crack at John Rambo with the intention of making the next movie more character driven as well, as opposed to the last two action oriented sequels. If he can revive Rambo as well as he did ROCKY BALBOA, then count me in.",1166659200,4,8349,4.740536820371645
2744006,4,B000MRA58S,"The entire Rocky series has been a great ride.  All of the Rocky films have been inspirational, entertaining, and of course a little predictable.

Rocky Balboa is no exception, but this film has the same ""rough"" edges that made the first Rocky such a hit.

Rocky is still back in Philadelphia, but now he owns an Italian restaurant (Adrian's) with Mexican cooks preparing the food.  The restaurant kind of becomes the focal point for a lot of what goes on in the film.  Well, that and Adrian's gravesite.  The scenes at both of these locations work well, and add a lot of realism to Stallone's sixth installment of the series.

Sylvester Stallone and his films have always inspired me to believe in the impossible; I'm sure many people around the globe think the same.  He has been criticized for riding the success of the Rocky films, but I think the films are great.  I also consider Stallone a man who has lived a full life, giving his all to his work, his family, and himself.  He's made mistakes, but he has always accepted responsibility for his actions and moved on.

Stallone had to have doubts about making Rocky Balboa.  But I noticed the people in the theater, especially the generation who grew up watching the Rocky films, seemed to be visiting a cast of old friends as they watched the film progress.

The only part of the movie I thought could have been a lot better was the fight sequences between Rocky and Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver).  After all of the amazing boxing matches Rocky has been in, only a match between Rocky and Godzilla would have sufficed a true Rocky fan.

The best parts of the film are every single scene with Geraldine Hughes (Marie).  She absolutely steals the show with every move she makes and every word she speaks.  Whether she is telling Rocky about her son, Steps (James Francis Kelly III) or giving Rocky a speech about why he should box the current champion (a crazy idea if you ask me), she is so believable that she deserves an academy award for almost single-handedly carrying this film into the Land of Possibility.  Geraldine Hughes is now my favorite actress!

Rocky fans will also be happy with Paulie's (Burt Young) return to the big screen.  Age has not made Paulie anymore of an adult, and his dialogue throughout the film reminds us why we all first fell in love with this guy - as creepy as that sounds.

Rocky Balboa is not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.  It has just enough things going on in the film to keep it interesting, just enough action scenes to get your blood pumping, and just enough romance to make you wonder if Rocky and Marie get married in the never-to-be-made Rocky 7 (Rocky and Marie Balboa).

At the end of the movie, the people in the theater broke out in applause.  I think men and women appreciate the hard work Stallone has put into his Rocky films.  I think they were saying goodbye to their old friend - Rocky Balboa.

And I think we are all going to miss him!

Bye Rocky!  It has been a blast!

2744029,5,B000MRA58S,"I wasn't as down on Rocky V as most people were, but the fact that Rocky didn't go out in the ring kind of left a black eye on the entire Rocky series.  Fighting Tommy Gunn in the street wasn't nearly as good as one more title shot would have been.  Well, in Rocky Balboa, a 50+ year old Balboa gets his one last shot.

It was very different seeing the Rocky characters in the 21st century.  Rocky's son worked for a corporation, Rocky owned a restaurant, Paulie STILL worked at the Meat Packing plant.  Instead of having the local news carry the info on Sports like in Rocky movies of the past, ESPN carried the info, and HBO Pay Per View televised the actual fight.  I also like the fact that the championship fight was only scheduled for 10 rounds, instead of the 15 they used to fight back in the 70's and 80's.

There was no mention of Rocky's actual age, just that he was ""in his 50's"", which I thought was a bit unrealistic.  If a fighter in his 50's today got into the ring, headlines would always say his actual age.

I enjoyed the guy who played Rocky's son very much.  I thought he did a very good job.  Stallone and Burt Young played Rocky and Paulie just as well as ever, although Burt Young, at times, seemed a little rusty.

All in all, great storyline, a few exceptional speeches by Rocky about life, and I left the theatre pumped up, with a different outlook on life.  I love movies that make you think that you're living your life wrong.  Any movie that can bring about self-reflection is a winner in my book.",1166659200,,1527,4.275261324041812
2744030,5,B000MRA58S,"Cue the music! Rocky Balboa, the most beloved onscreen character and highly anticipated sequel of the the year, is back!

Written and directed by, and starring Sylvester Stallone in the role that made him a movie star, Rocky Balboa, like the title character, triumphs. This film could end up being the surprise hit of the year.

16 years have passed since the last Rocky movie, part 5 that is, Rocky is now a widow; Adrian has been dead for nearly 3 years (Talia Shire appears only in flashbacks). It's a walk down memory lane in the first third of the film as Rocky visits the places he and Adrian met and went to in their early days accompanied by Paulie who dreads the annual ritual because it reminds him of how bad he was to his sister. When he's not touring the sites, Rocky is sitting at Adrian's grave pondering what's left of his own life.

Rocky has closed the doors of Mickey's gym, and is now the owner of a local restaurant named after his late wife. Rocky goes around the restarant every now and then, telling customers stories of his glory days. One of his regular patrons is Spider Rico, the guy he fought and defeated in the opening minutes of the original Rocky. Another old face in the neighborhood Rocky bumps into is 'little' Marie, the girl who once told him ""Screw you, Creepo"" after walking her home and giving her advice on how to live her life. She ends up being a pivotal character in Rocky's post-Adrian life. She even reminds him of Adrian with her encouragement, and support. However, their relationship does not evolve into romance, which is quite understandable.

Rocky is in pain. He's old and lonely. He regains the passion to fight again to unleash the 'beast' that is still inside of him. His son, played by Milo Ventimiglia, is striving to find his place in the corporate world but can't escape dad's shadow; and as a result despises his father's decision to return to the ring. Things get heated up when ESPN airs a computer generated fight between the new champ Mason The Line Dixon, played by real life boxr Antonio Tarver, who is disregarded by the boxing community as a phony, and Rocky. Computer says that Rocky would win by knockout. This causes a stir with the press and fans, and gives both Dixon and Rocky the chance to prove their worthiness.

Rocky Balboa succeeds in exploring Rocky's inner feelings at his old age. The scene where Rocky expresses that he still has 'stuff in the basement' to Paulie is extremely convincing, especially when the grieving Rocky breaks down in tears. There's also the scene where Rocky angrily refutes the Boxing Commission's refusal to renew his boxing license, a scene so intense, many members in the audience cheered. It's a powerful performance by Sly that will leave audiences wondering why this man has never had the chance to evolve properly as a character actor. Oscar, anyone?

The climactic fight scene at the end is incredible. Even the commentator in the movie says he can't believe he is only moments away from watching Rocky fight again. That's exactly the same feeling I had. When the fight did begin, I was literally on the edge of my seat. Stallone's directing is so precise that Rocky's final round, both in the ring and on the movie screens, goes down in style.

Would I pay to watch it again?

Yo, absolutely!

Last year I was so happy to hear about the new rocky movie coming out in 06. Still I had my doubts because of stallone's age, the lackluster rocky 5, and the long break since there had been a rocky movie out.

  I'll say right away that it's not the best Rocky movie. No sequel ever is, but this one was pretty good. It definite does a good job at concluding the franchise.

  If you liked any of the Rocky movies, go see this. It was way better than I had expected, and as a hardcore rocky fan, I loved it. I felt like a little kid again, bouncing up and down in my seats during the fight at the end. Stallone at 59 was in amazing shape, and the story and film making techniques of stallone made this a great movie. I'm gonna go see it again.

2744032,5,B000MRA58S,"Stallone deserves praise for taking the time and effort to see that the ROCKY series ends on a proper note and comes ""full circle"" instead of having an American Icon fade away in disgrace as would have been the case if we had been left with Rocky 5.

In many ways this film is a ""mirror"" or an ""opposite book-end"" to Rocky I as we basically see a man who has come full circle in life with the similiar challenges only made different by the passage of time.

Unrelated to the movie itself, Stallone also deserves credit for showing that ""60 is the new 40"" in today's society for people who are dedicated enough to diet and exercise.

Not only does he look great for 60 in this film, he looks better than 50% of the population in their 30s.

I also see a ""need"" for this film in todays' American society.

In 1976-1977, when the first Rocky came out, America was at a lowpoint in terms of image, self-esteem, respect, etc....

Much of this of course is due to one of our worst Presidents ever.... Jimmy Carter.

Rocky became a mobilizing icon to remind Americans about dedication, hard work, sacrifice, and ""never giving up"".

Thru the 80s, America refound itself, Reagan ended the Cold War, the Berlin Wall was torn down, etc...

In other words, instead of being negative, America made things happen in the world !

Now in late 2006, we have a similiar situation.

Much of America has grown soft, fat, lazy, happy and stupid as a result

of having it too good for too long.

People criticize those trying to take action to protect this Country from an impending crisis.

(apparently 50% of our society has no knowledge of history or they would clearly see the importance of action TODAY in the Middle East before we get to the point England, France and Germany are facing already today).

Getting to the point.... too many Americans today are apathetic, soft and are trying to rationalize ""no action"" as a way to live their lives in ""cushy"" ignorance of reality.

Perhaps if we are fortunate, the film ROCKY BALBOA can do for us today  what it did for America in 1977................. namely, get people to remember what hard work, sacrfice, duty, standing for principles and ""never giving up"" really means.

Hopefully this current generation can recapture at lease a glimmer of what made the WW2 generation so strong.

Only then can we get back on track and remake America great again as opposed to the disentrgrating cesspool of decadence it is becoming now (like a repeat of the Roman Empire 400AD).

2744033,5,B000MRA58S,"Although I have almost always only reviewed books on Amazon, I had to write my feelings on ""Rocky Balboa"". As someone who counts the original Rocky as one of my favorite films of all time, I had to see this movie, which I did last night to a Sold Out audience. Most of the people in the theatre were guys around my age. As soon as the previews ended and the movie started, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause. Who would have thought that a fictional underdog from South Philly from the late 70s would carry such a following for all of these years.

I thought that Rocky Balboa was excellent - not because the boxing scenes were great, or because every scene was a treat, or because the acting was the best I've ever seen, although Stallone did a great job I thought. But the film was very inspirational and reminds us that no matter who we are, we can achieve our dreams. Rocky reminds us that it does not matter how hard life hits, so long as we get up and keep going forward. Rocky did so in life and inspired me to keep on going forward in my life with this excellent film. Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky, Rocky . . . . . . .",1166659200,,1131,4.164383561643835
2744034,5,B000MRA58S,"When Sylvester Stallone had his career lows and bombs with Get Carter and the equally depressing Spy Kids films, it was hard to believe the man had once defeated Apollo Creed and took on armies donning red bandanas. However as fate handed it to Stallone, he was down and out for the count.

As if Stallone's career has it's own Mick or Adrian at the sidelines, he is back and bigger than ever. From a fresh script and a crisp yet gritty visual style that harkens back to 1970's pioneer filmmaking, Rocky Balboa is the most exciting and accepting sequel since James Cameron's T2: Judgment Day in 1991. Everything is fresh, but none too far from the original scope of work that the boxing series entails.

Rocky Balboa, long since retired, is the owner of an Italian eatery called Adrian's still in his hometown of Philadelphia, PA. Things are not the same, though. His wife Adrian passed away a few years beforehand, while his son is taking off on a career of his own. However, things are starting to shake and move when a computer simulated match names Rocky Balboa winner over the undisputed champion, Mason ""The Line"" Dixon.

Where to start?

From Bill Conti's beautiful arrangements to several landmark settings from the originals, everything about Rocky Balboa is nostalgic. However, this is not a remake in the slightest sense, and more importantly this is not a novelty act. The film may highlight on the original over some of the more successful sequels, yet this is a story of it's own.

There are new faces while there are some old. It is hard to picture a Rocky film without Talia Shire, but it works so well that it would be hard to take the picture seriously with her in it. The character of Balboa has not been this moving and sentimental since the original. His age shows yet there is more youth than ever as he explores the possibilites and fate of his senior status.

Nevertheless, this film seems more autobiographical than ever. Perhaps it is not Rocky being displayed on the screen, but Stallone himself reminding us that all is not vacant in that head of his. After all, this is the man who brought us some of film's most prolific characters, which is why it is so depressing to see his name tarnished in the past decade.

In the long run, Rocky Balboa will still prove to be both an excellent film and one of the best footnotes for a filmatic series. Not only is this the best holiday film, it's probably the most motivating one too. When that montage hits and you're moving in your seat, it's okay, you can dance around and clap because chances are every person seated either behind or in front of you is doing the exact same thing.

Tonight I saw ROCKY BALBOA and was left emotionally drained. It was a very special night that I will always remember. I'm thankful to Sylvester Stallone for giving ROCKY fans one last round.",1166572800,2,331,4.426229508196721
2744036,4,B000MRA58S,"Rocky is back in his 6th and final film. The first half of the film moves a bit slow as the audience is updated on Rocky's life since we last saw him 16 years ago. The most obvious change is the absense of Adrian (Rocky's wife), who has passed away. An emotionally damaged Rocky revisits the past, hoping to fill the void (of Adrian) in his heart. This eventually leads him back to his passion of boxing, which serves as the ultimate symbol of his determination.

So how does Rocky get back into the ring (for a title shot) at 59 years old? Well, it's the same old Rocky premise: Current champ is seen as a fake by the public and fights Rocky in hopes of gaining the respect he thinks he deserves. However, it's a premise that works and true Rocky fans embrace time and again. Sure, I wasn't completely happy with the ending, and at times Rocky gets carried away with his moronic one liners. But, Stallone delivered what he promised: a sweet goodbye from an old friend",1166572800,2,968,4.377777777777778
2744037,4,B000MRA58S,"To put things in perspective, when the original ""Rocky"" came out, my wife was still three years away from being born.  That's 30 years Stallone has been playing this Rocky Balboa.  I grew up with the first two films on endless TV reruns and saw the later ones in the theater.  My nostalgia-fueled anticipation for tonight's premiere was akin to the thrill I felt for the final ""Lord of the Rings"" movie, or for ""Superman Returns"", or even for the misbegotten Chronicles of Narnia movie last year.  Literally I've been waiting decades to see this movie.  ""Rocky V"" bombed when I was still in high school and I was hoping Rocky would get one last chance to knock out evil boxers with ridiculous ring nicknames.

My advice is that you'll need to see this movie in a packed theater, as I did.  I can't imagine it would have the same effect on the small screen when you're alone with a much smaller crowd.  In many ways, the best part of this film was the spontaneous call-and-response from the audience I was with, two storeys beneath 3rd Avenue.  People shouted famous ""Rocky"" catchphrases at the screen seconds before the famous fanfare started playing.  ""I pity the fool!"", ""I will break you!"", ""If he dies, he dies!"", and, of course, ""Mickey!!""

Once all the pre-movie nostalgia was out of the way... it was time for more nostalgia.  Wisely or not, Stallone (who wrote and directed) soaked the first half of the script in nostalgia so deep for the first, small-scale ""Rocky"", that significant screen time was devoted to characters who hadn't appeared since the original's second reel.  I had to explain to my wife who Spider Rico was, and why Rocky needed him in his inner circle by the end of the movie.  Also great to see the return Duke, Apollo Creed's old trainer, although most of Tony Burton's lines appear to have been looped in post-production.

The main problem with ""Rocky Balboa"" early on is Stallone's concept of dialogue.  Just about every character in this movie delivers a loud speech about motivation and glory and drive and passion.  Rocky's defense of his application for a boxing permit to the State athletic commission (after 20 years of retirement) is particularly ludicrous, although Stallone must think it's going to cap off the montage for his Lifetime Achievement Oscar.

Once the nostalgia and flashbacks clears out and the plot settles in, the film picks up steam.  Antonio Tarver does a decent job as Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, the brazen young champ at odds with the boxing establishment.  Dixon never really becomes a villain in this movie -- he even has a Rocky/Mickey relationship with his own trainer.

Also welcome are the numerous cable TV personality cameos.  Everyone from ESPN's Brian Kenny to ESPN Classic's Bert Randolph Sugar to the entire HBO fight team (Merchant and Lampley and I, Max) chips in; too bad Jim Rome got left on the cutting room floor.  The only thing missing from the celebrity bandwagon was Randy and Jason Sklar doing ""Cheap Seats"" commentary over the Rocky vs. Thunderlips celebrity boxing/wrestling match.  Maybe in a deleted scene on DVD?

In the end, ""Rocky Balboa""'s a fun nostalgia trip that echoes the original in tone and sentiment, and even has a similar bittersweet finale.  This is never going to become a TNT rerun classic like ""Rocky III"" and probably has no catchphrases of its own, but if Rocky's been one of your movie heroes since the 1970s, check him out one last time.",1166572800,5,3444,4.765598650927488
2744068,4,B000MRA58S,"I'm a big fan of the ""Rocky"" series, and I was very excited to see ""Rocky Balboa."" I didn't enjoy the film quite as much as I thought I would, but I still recommend it.

Here's the basic plot of the film: Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) has been running a small Italian restaurant in south Philadelphia for about ten years. His beloved wife Adrian (Talia Shire, who appears only in flashbacks of the other five ""Rocky"" movies) died of cancer three years ago. Rocky has been unable to let go of her, and the first 45 minutes of the movie basically outline the tremendous amount of grief he is feeling. In a way, Rocky is also grieving for his son (Milo Ventimiglia). Now a grown man, Rocky Jr. is unhappy with his job and has tried to distance himself from his father.

Rocky ultimately decides that he wants to try his hand at boxing again. He manages to acquire a license and plans to concentrate on small local fights. However, the current heavyweight champion, Mason Dixon (Antonio Tarver), becomes rattled after a televised computer matchup between him and Rocky deems Rocky as the winner. Mason invites Rocky to participate in an exhibition match, and Rocky accepts the offer.

Rocky's training doesn't go as smoothly as it did before: he's pushing 60 now and has to deal with arthritis, calcium deposits, and a variety of other ailments. As always, though, Rocky perseveres, and he gets a lot of help from his son and from good old Paulie (Burt Young). The film culminates in a Pay-Per-View matchup between Rocky and Mason in Las Vegas, which is as intense and emotional as every other fight we've seen in the series.

I won't spoil the ending for everyone, but I think the result of the fight was entirely appropriate. Once again, Rocky shows us the importance of fighting hard to keep our dreams alive, despite any obstacles that come our way. The film is very reminiscent of the first ""Rocky"" movie, and I really enjoyed that. There are also many flashbacks from the previous five films, and those old clips were a lot of fun to watch.

Even though I liked the movie, there were a few things I didn't care for. As I mentioned before, the first 45 minutes of the movie were incredibly depressing. Stallone obviously wanted us to focus on Rocky's character more than just the fighting itself, and I get that, but still...it was too darn depressing! Also, Rocky's friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) was interesting at first because of the way she actually knows Rocky from years back, but I think the movie focused too much on their relationship. Marie did not have to be such a prominent fixture in the film. Finally, I didn't like the way most of the fight was filmed. It looked like we were watching an actual Pay-Per- View fight, which seemed very out of place with the rest of the movie's style. Stallone switched to using ""regular"" camera angles again at the very end of the fight, but I don't understand why he went with the whole HBO sports film sequence for so long.

Overall, I think Rocky fans will really enjoy this movie. It's very bittersweet, but it was nice to have a solid conclusion to the series. (And ANYTHING would have been better than ""Rocky V!"")",1166572800,8,3176,4.622340425531915

2744071,3,B000MRA58S,"Before I saw this movie, I asked myself 'who will this movie appeal to?' For old folks (such as myself), this iteration of Rocky might make me realize just how old we both are  (not a pleasant thought). To the younger generation, it might make them wonder why this movie needed to be made at all. After seeing the film, there is still no answer to my question.

The film is classic 'Rocky'. There are the endearing qualities of Rocky the man (such as referring to a Jamaican as  `a European') as well as the typical character witticisms we've come to love over the last thirty years. There is also Rocky's fondness for a former boxer (Spider Rico) he once fought (but not near the character development we saw with Apollo Creed).

We see familiar faces and places, such as Adrian (in flashback) whom Rocky visits regularly at the cemetery, Bert Young (as Paulie), and of course, the steps of the Philadelphia Museum (the end credits were a nice touch). There's even a cameo by Mike Tyson. But for most of the film Rocky is bemoaning the departed Adrian. It is almost pathetic to watch him visit memorable sites they once shared, such as the ice rink, which is no longer there. Enough already.

The movie is replete with 'shadows'. Rocky--living in the shadow of his former greatness--reduced to reliving the stories of fights long past. Rocky's son--now an inept businessman--living in the shadow of his father's legend. And Rocky's new love interest (wonderfully played by Irish actress Geraldine Hughes whose Philly brogue hides her strong accent)--living in the shadow of Adrian, with a son old enough to soon make her a grandmother. (Has it really been this long?)

To summarize the plot, Rocky still has a 'something in his basement' to exorcise the beast within (presumably to fight again). Mason Dixon is an unpopular heavyweight champ who (again presumably) would benefit from a fight with Rocky, after a computer fight has the Rock knocking him out. And so, the stage is set: the 'up-and-coming' Dixon will battle 'has been', Rocky. The match is arranged as a glorified exhibition, and Rocky must prove that 'the heart is the last thing to go'.

We're left to wonder, however, how this young boxer has anything to gain when he has everything to lose--a point cogently made in the film. This plot flaw--along with the absolutely 'goes nowhere' love interest--seriously cripples the movie.

But what this movie really lacks is believability, and the build-up we've come to expect toward pulling for the Rock to upset an opponent we love to hate. Mason Dixon never convinces us that he truly wants to destroy Rocky, or that he is unable to do so when he finally gets the chance. (The writers obviously anticipated this credibility issue, and the fighter breaks his hand.) Also, this fighter creates nowhere near the fight anticipation Ivan Drago created in Rocky IV. There is simply no hate between the rivals, and even in the fight, we wonder who will win more than we really care.

In the end, (without giving it away) let's say Rocky is mercifully retired forever. To their credit, the writers did not create an unbelievable ending to an unbelievable movie. As much as many of us loved the old films, we could not help but cringe when the Rock finally bears his chest. He is old, wrinkled, and fat. This time he cannot make us believe he should be in that ring, much less make us believe he could survive what happens in it. In previous Rocky movies, the fight piqued our suspense, and the ending made us cheer. In this one, we are left to merely endure the fight, and simply wish it over so we can see what novelty ending the writers will provide us this time.

I loved the old 'Rocky's'. But like most fighters he stayed for one fight too many. This movie made me feel really old and tired. Mercifully, ran less than a couple of hours, and I will always have the old Rocky movies when I need inspiration rather than a spoon of Geritol.",1166572800,4,3946,4.664748201438849

2744073,5,B000MRA58S,"If Stallone keeps making Rocky movies, I would pay money to see every last one of them: I am a huge fan of the series, and I am a huge fan of the idea of having the courage to pursue your dreams and to pursue what God created you to do.

When an ESPN computer fight shows Rocky Balboa knocking out current heavyweight title holder Mason ""The Line"" Dixon, something stirs Rocky deep inside, a need to do what he was created to do, a need to fight again. Everyone thinks he's nuts, except for faithful friend Little Marie, who tells him that ""fighters fight.""

An astute Amazon reviewer noted that there are a lot of shadows in this movie: Rocky is living in the shadow of his glory days, the son is living in the shadow of his father, Mason Dixon is living in Rocky's shadow, even Spider Rico is living in Rocky's shadow, and Little Marie is living in Adrian's shadow (there are also a lot of shadowy scenes in the film
(alleys and streetlight scenes).

In a sense, Rocky himself is living in Adrian's shadow, as he struggles to move on with his life without her.

Let me also say that the fight scenes were very realistic, it
definitely has the look and feel of an HBO PPV telecast. My favorite
line is when Lampley asks Larry Merchant why they are calling this
fight an exhibition and Merchant says ""so they won't have to call it an
execution.""

Yes, the movie pulls at your tear ducts: The movie begins with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian and ends with Rocky at the tomb of Adrian. On the anniversary of Adrian's passing, Rocky goes to all of their special places and visits with her. He even tells his grown son, ""Don't forget to visit your mom.""

And yes, there are plenty of nods to nostalgia and maybe even a bit of self-parody, but this movie definitely climbs off the canvas and achieves a cinematic victory. Rocky Balboa is a knockout!",1166572800,3,1841,4.368421052631579

Rocky Balboa is one of the most likable characters ever, so he's easy to root for in any situation. But in this installment, there is really nothing on the line.  He isn't fighting for anything.  The fight falls flat because of it.  Even if he gets his head smashed in, its expected.  If he beats the heavyweight champ, it's ridiculous.  Sort of a no-win.

The lack of Adrian was noticable and sad.  They try to fill the female void with a kid from his past who is now a single mother, but that relationship ultimately leads nowhere, despite being a very substantial portion of the film.

I got the sense in the theater, which was packed, that everyone was waiting to go nuts and get excited, as Rocky has made us all do in the past.  But that moment never came.

While Stallone looks great for a guy his age, Rocky looks slow, old, and ridiculous at times.  Had they done this movie 10-15 yrs ago, and made it the 5th and final installment, it probably would have done the series good.",1166054400,2,1032,4.373684210526315

For its indomitable faith in the underlying goodness of the American people, it deserves to be in the American Film Institute's list of 'The 100 Best Dramas' and it should be shown to schoolchildren in every foreign country. It is a beautiful film and, to Mr. Stallone's enormous credit, there is not a single gun or knife or vicious encounter to be seen (even the obligatory closing fight, for all its invested energy, is more of a flamenco duel than a bruising assault). In fact, there is not even a villain to boo and hiss, such is the maturity of the writing; the closest thing to it is the fight promoters but they are shown as businessmen simply, and openly, brokering a deal that they think best for their client. This is an intensely humane film. Virtually every one of the characters is damaged in some way but is salvaged by the care of others, most obviously by the character of Rocky himself. Watching it, I was reminded at times of Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' but, whereas that film was often noisily over-acted and sentimental, this film is perfectly pitched; there certainly is sentiment but it is laconic and subdued, in a way that echoes Steinbeck. Further, on this evidence, Mr. Stallone is one of the most thoughtful and generous players in Hollywood; as writer, director, and lead actor, not only does he create this powerful, compelling and life-enhancing drama, he also treats his fellow players with such care and ensures every one of them has an extended chance to light up the screen.
