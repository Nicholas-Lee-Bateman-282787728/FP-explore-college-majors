8354134,5,B00276IFIE,"My name is Eric (the Healer) Dadmehr (Sacramento, California) and I am very honored to have shared the experience of shooting and producing this video after I had studied film at UCLA (BA Fine Arts 1986). Quentin Josephy from Kinetic Studios (and Jillian) hired me [when I was a grocery clerk at Safeway (now Pavilions Place) on Lincoln and Montana in Santa Monica] to shoot Video 8 Pro digital tape of a week seminar and edit it down with Quentin and Jillian directing to two hours. I was very lucky to meet Carola too and talk about her life with Joseph Pilates as his senior student. I was studying yoga and martial arts at the time and it really made sense to me how to heal injured parts of your body naturally because most surgery is unnecessary. Often athletes and dancers that injure themselves so badly that they can't do their sport or dance again find out about Pilates and heal themselves so they can do their sport and dance again. I loved when she talked about the spirit and body connections that Western Science neglects since we don't talk about the spirit here in hospitals except when it leaves the body. They paid me hansomly in addition to percentage to make copies for many years from Video 8mm to VHS tape and then later to DVD. I later sold a master copy to Jillian after we agreed that I had made enough percentage. Now that we have caught up with European resolutuion of PAL and SECAM with our NTSC digital signal, it is easy to notice the difference at first with the technology available back then but as you watch you get pulled in and forget. I might talk to my USC film teacher Steve Binder that UCLA hired to teach our class to use his studio to clean this film up maybe or go to Sundance Film Studio to talk to Robert Redford maybe after I finish my book on how lucky I have been meeting all the people I did when I lived in Los Angeles (Santa Monica) called ""I've been really lucky all my life!"" Hey Amazon, do you publish too?",1306972800,,1961,4.375342465753425
8354135,5,B00276IFIE,"It's been 15 years since I took my first Pilates class on a Mat, and I have been in love ever since (I am now a Pilates instructor and teacher trainer in New York City). The method just keeps fascinating me and the more I learn, the more endless the body of work that Joe Pilates left behind for us appears. Like any other Pilates professional I spend countless dollars on books, DVD's, classes, and workshop after workshop... but I have to say that buying this DVD was one of my best investments in recent years! If you dig deep enough you find archival video footage of the man himself practicing and teaching his exercises, but to my knowledge there is no footage that lets us listen to Joe's voice. I am so grateful that Jillian Hessel documented the teachings of Carola Trier, beloved first generation teacher of the Pilates method, and lets us hear her voice. Yes, the image and sound quality is subpar, but it doesn't really seem to matter once you start watching. It just feels like you are there with her, so much you may find yourself raising your hand to try to ask her a question. I got the DVD this morning, watched it twice, and can't wait to get to the studio to teach my clients tomorrow!",1299024000,,1204,4.403587443946188
8354136,5,B00276IFIE,This DVD is digitally remastered from a home video of a two day workshop edited down to 2 hours of sheer delight. I hardly knew where the time had gone as I watched. Fabulous to see one of the original Pilates teachers in action and wonderful to see such eloquent demonstration by Jillian Hessel. This is a marvellous resource for teachers. I would love to see some accompanying editorial notes (but maybe these will follow) as the fixed viewpoint of the camera doesn't always do justice to the action. A must have for anyone interested in real Pilates.,1256428800,,553,4.653061224489796
8354137,5,B00276IFIE,"Bravo Jillian Hessel for editing and bringing to light this DVD, Carola Shares. Carola was a master in the field of Pilates, she taught with ingenuity and intelligence. I was lucky enough to be at this workshop at the beginning of my career as a Pilates instructor, and her knowledge helped shape my ability as a teacher. This DVD is comprehensive and I love that Ms. Hessel gives us Carola's background along with her own personal history with her. Anyone that wants to teach the Pilates method of exercise in a detailed and artistic manner should own this DVD, and learn from it. I am extremely happy to have it in my library -- to once again be inspired by this magnanimous  master teacher!

Jillian Hessel continues her tradition of producing the best Pilates media available! This DVD could easily be called: Carola Shares the Art of Pilates. Filmed in 1989 at a Pilates workshop for teachers this 20 year old footage is very timely!
It proves that Pilates is an art form, not just a quick fix exercise gimmick. It is a completely autonomous discipline for which there is no shortcut to achieve the benefits and that has no need for fusion with other types of exercise.
Anyone and everyone should view this DVD, from the beginning practitioner to professional instructors! Pilates instructors can use it as a living reference guide and for inspiration in time when the originality and purity of Pilates seems all but lost in the hype. It provides a very thorough overview of the progression from mat work to the different types of Pilates apparatus. This is especially helpful for those who are unfamiliar with the depth and potential for transformation on the apparatus.
The case contains a disclaimer regarding the production quality due to the difficulties of transferring an old video format to DVD. This a very minor snag if at all. Ms. Trier died in 2000 and the Pilates community is blessed to have this documentation of a true master teacher.",1244419200,2,1403,5.410958904109589
