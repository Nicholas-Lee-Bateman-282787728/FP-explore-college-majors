7463893,5,B01690GTK4,A great movie I watch over and over and so glad to pre order DVD. I love all of Lacey Chabert's Hallmark movies and watch them all the time on DVR. I buy the DVDs when available. This is a sweet movie and great chemistry with Brennon Elliott. All the characters are good. Love the house! I hope there is a part 2 to this story.,1452038400,,327,3.9696969696969697
7463894,5,B01690GTK4,"I absolutely agree with the other reviews.  This movie was perfect in every way.  The characters were liveable as well as the story line.  Thank you for making it available.  Love, love, love this movie!!",1451088000,5,204,4.742857142857143
7463895,5,B01690GTK4,"Lacey Chabert has acted in many Hallmark channel movies. She always does a convincing job in portraying her character. She brings the character in this movie alive as well.

Our two main characters are totally opposite in their goals in life, until they inherit a home that they must share. This becomes the ""recipe"" for living together, restoring the home, and learning what truly is important in life.

There are some creative avenues to earn money and some realization that the high powered business world is not all it is supposed to be when your heart changes. The characters opposite tendencies become one and there is love in the air.

I loved seeing Ed Asner in the movie.

I enjoyed the movie and I think you will too.

7463896,5,B01690GTK4,"All of my Heart stars Lacey Chabert (a favorite of mine since the old Party of Five television show) as Jenny Fintley and Brennan Elliott as Brian Howell as well as Ed Asner as Vern.

Jenny is a caterer who finds out she has inherited a house in a small town  well it turns out to be half a house as Brian, a brash stock broker inherits the other half.  Quite a shock to the both of them and their plans for the house could not be more different.  Lacey wants to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast using her skill as a chef and Brian wants to sell it immediately to get the cash.

When Brian's job goes belly-up, he ends up moving into the house along with Jenny and their personalities clash and then sparks start to fly of another nature.

Ed Asner plays Vern, the grumpy old curmudgeon with a secret heart of gold. This is essentially the part that he has been playing since the old Mary Tyler Moore Show and has perfected (even finally growing into actually being old.)

The chemistry between the two main characters is great and you begin to root for them to get together.  The best part of the movie for me was also the funniest and that is when Brian decides that he is going to fix some things around the house (as in carpentry, etc.) without a clue.  This is a side story within the story and had me laughing throughout.

This movie was part of Hallmarks run-up to Valentine's Day 2015.  It is a sweet and funny romance that will be fun to watch over and over again.",1447286400,45,1473,4.243727598566308

7463967,3,B01690GTK4,"I absolutely loved the first part of this story and thought it was one of the best Hallmark films I've seen. All of the main characters are back for the sequel which makes it nice since most of them are very likable. There are a couple of new characters including some guests at the inn who are also likable but with fairly small parts. The big letdown with this sequel is that they apparently filmed it in a completely different location so none of the places are the same. This is unfortunate because the house was a huge plot element in the first story and it just doesn't seem right to pretend that they are in the same house when it is clearly a much different one. The same goes for the town, the country store and the coffee shop. Aside from that, this film is almost as likable as the first. In this one, the couple are six months down the road and trying to open the bed an breakfast. They are very much in love but are facing some challenges because the house keeps costing money. A big storm one night floods the place and puts the situation over the top. The guy ends up taking up an offer to go back to New York to close one deal which turns into a couple of deals. He does this to make some money to help with the B&B but end up exhausted from commuting and torn about which world he fits into. This leads to some tension but nothing terribly rough and the whole story has a happy ending. It's hard to do a happily ever after sequel to a good rom com, and this one does a pretty decent job. It's not quite as catchy as the first one, but if you can get past the unpardonable changing of locales, you will probably like this one too.",1519084800,5,1646,4.146875

7463969,2,B01690GTK4,Loved the characters in the first movie and Im always happy to watch Lacey Chabert.  But this movie simply redoes the plot of the first movie.  Girl with financial troubles but a great baker tries to make county B&B work.  Guy goes back to Manhattan and is conflicted about the excitement of Wallstreet and the lure of his sweetheart back in the country.  Nothing new here despite the likability of the characters and the actors.  Wish Hallmark had a better script for them!,1519084800,5,474,4.662650602409639

7463972,4,B01690GTK4,"I always read the one star reviews before buying a movie. Since there were so few, I decided to give it a try. I had purchased their first
All of My Heart movie, and thought it would be interesting to see a ""sequel"". I did find Lacey Chabert's character to be a little whiny when
her fiance Brennan had to go back to Wall Street to make money to keep the creditors at bay after the rain storm hit and the house they
were fixing into a bed and breakfast needed a new roof. However, the movie also had a lot of charm. Other characters from the first movie
were featured again, and some found loves of their own. I wouldn't mind seeing another sequel to this movie. Their b and b could
become a place for other romances to originate, and if Hallmark handled it right, it could be very sweet. One of the negative reviewers mentioned
how Edward Asner should ""give it up"", or something to that effect. Actually, I feel sorry for him. He looks terribly old and unable to get up without
help, and he deserves our prayers, not criticism.",1518393600,11,1028,4.304123711340206

7463974,4,B01690GTK4,"I absolutely love this sequel. But, there are some obvious errors comparing it to the first one. It is hard to know where to begin. The Inn itself looks nothing like the Inn in the first version. Second, now Jenny is driving a Honda CRV where as before she had a Jeep. The general store has a completely different facade. These are glaring errors that should have never happened. Why did they have to change all of that? Did they think no one would notice?  These errors, put a dent in my overall review of the movie. These errors go beyond a simple remodel or change, they're completely different buildings, 100%. That, is not good.",1518048000,5,633,4.504347826086956

I bought it online though for $12.99 when I could have got the actual DVD for $6.99. The house and kitchen were different. The home is no longer on a hill or painted green. The sign is different also. This movie starts out 6 months after the first. They are both still fixing up the Inn, broke and tired. Still not married but signs show they do not share a bedroom. Hmmm! That is good. This is a very sweet love story. There are a couple more in it too. I like the kindness of the guests. I love the crazy Wall street guy. The end has a cute flirtatious scene. The absolute yummy looking scenes throughout are inspiring. I would have liked to see the original Chef in this one. However I see him already in many Hallmark movies. I give this 4 stars, less one for lack of continuity and it is a little choppy. The singing water pipes were different and tall guy looked different. I think it is more worth the $6.99. I also really hope a consideration is given to make this a series. Perhaps a replacement for Chesapeake Shores?",1517875200,,1200,4.244541484716157

And what they did to the Inn may be charming, but that too was unexpected.  Also, Gabby and her two kids are obviously not the same goats.  I was disappointed in this.  I expected her to be ""expecting"" a baby: that would have made for a good sequel.  Good to see all the old faces back again, but just should have been done with more careful thought.

7463990,5,B01690GTK4,"LOVE this movie - great story, great characters with great chemistry.  I love how Jenny's optimism plays against Brian's Wall Street city-boy persona and how they both change throughout the movie to find each other, and themselves. I enjoyed ""getting to know"" the supporting characters too.  Good movie for when you just need to ""smile""...and it has baby goats...who wouldn't smile watching baby goats?",1512691200,,402,5.265625
7463991,2,B01690GTK4,"Hallmark should have left this sequel on the drawing board until they came up with a better follow-up. I loved the original and looked forward to the next chapter in the story, but it seems they just threw something together to bank on the original success. The story is weak, some of the characters I loved in the first movie are annoying in the sequel. The ""side"" stories they tried to introduce aren't developed enough to make me care - which would be fine if Jenny and Brian's story was better written. If you liked the original, you might want to stay clear  of this one, especially if you liked Jenny's spunk & optimism in #1, she whines & complains too much in #2. I was also disappointed - and confused - by the supposed ""renovation"" of the Inn; we spent the first movie watching them pull the Inn together and get to the ""pre-opening"" party; why is there a totally different Inn in the sequel? Only think I can think is they needed to manufacture a reason for Brian to go back to work on Wall Street to give Jenny something to whine about, and that's all the writers could think of. Poor story development overall.",1512691200,12,1123,4.42512077294686

7463993,2,B01690GTK4,"Apparently this movie is a sequel to a movie made two years ago. I get the feeling I'd probably like the first movie better -- where the couple actually meet, fight and then fall in love.

In this one they're engaged and getting ready to run a bed and breakfast from a house they both equally inherited from the same woman (and I never quite got how they weren't actually related from this movie). The house is a money pit and they've run through all of their savings just to get it presentable enough to be able to rent out some rooms.

Of course things go wrong - the roof is leaking (and flooding guest rooms) and the wiring is completely shot and has to be replaced; something that would easily cost tens of thousands of dollars to fix. Brian, the seemingly only reasonable/logical person in this movie (although I have to admit that it took me some time to warm up to him. The only other part I've seen this actor play is as a slimy, douchebag host on ""Unreal,"" so it was not easy to move past that) does some consulting work for a former colleague on Wall Street. But Jenny is just as determined to make the money from her homemade biscotti. Read that sentence again. The hero wants to do some short-term work that will net him a ton of cash. Jenny wants to use cookies to solve her problems. Somehow she thinks her one woman operation is going to save the day. (Do you know how many coffee cakes she'd have to sell to cover tens of thousands of dollars' worth of repairs?)

The conflict in this movie is that Brian loves being on Wall Street. He's good at what he does. He enjoys it. It fulfills him and makes him happy. And instead of understanding any of this, Jenny acts like an overgrown toddler for much of the movie, continually upset that her fiance is ""always gone"" (just as so many men in New York are ""always gone"" commuting and supporting their families). Brian working this hard is what makes it possible for Jenny to live her dream life - running a B&B in the country while making her baked goods to sell. If it were not for him, neither one of those things would be possible. And compromises could have been made (although Jenny claims she just can't see how one is possible). Brian could have telecommuted and worked from home several days a week. This falling down house is obviously going to need more repairs and more fixes. They need a stable income. Or Jenny could come to the city for a couple of days a week. (Although she claims she can't do this because she HAS to be there to run the B&B. Even though she could hire people to fill in for her). On days when the B&B is slow (which, my guess given that this county is overrun with B&Bs, will be quite frequently) she could go with Brian to the city. You know, compromise.

(Let me also just mention that Jenny rented out rooms to the nosiest people on the planet. Nearly every scene with a guest was the guest saying, ""Where's Brian?"" It was totally none of their business and I can't believe they asked over and over again about it. That seemed to be their only function - to highlight that Brian was ""always gone."")

But it's Jenny's way or the highway in this movie. Either Brian is at the B&B, totally devoted and dedicated only to her and their business (where she's allowed to find fulfillment and happiness) or they can't get married. There is no in-between. She seems to care very little for Brian's needs and desires. I didn't understand or appreciate her all or nothing attitude.

If you absolutely adored the first movie and think Jenny is wonderful and can do no wrong, you'll probably like this one. As someone starting with this movie, I'm not impressed with the story or the characterization at all.",1512518400,13,3694,4.409090909090909

7464005,4,B01690GTK4,"Jenny Fintley (Lacey Chabert) toils away in the kitchen of a demanding chef, only she hasn't let him trample on her spirits. She remains chipper and kindhearted. Jenny dreams of someday opening her own restaurant, but not yet. She goes to a fancy dinner with her boyfriend Daryl, and she's stoked. She anticipates a proposal. Instead, the oblivious Daryl goes on to brag about his new job in Singapore. That kills the relationship right there, plus his haircut is goofy.

There's balance in the universe. To make up for the loss of her boo, Jenny learns that she'd just inherited a house. Check that - she co-inherits a house. There's another beneficiary, whom she meets in the lawyer's office. Brian Howell (Brennan Elliott) doesn't strike a good first impression, not with Jenny. See him bustle in, all busy on the phone, a suit from Wall Street.

In Pennsylvania, in Bucks County, Danfield, Maple Lane, Jenny and Brian drive up to the house, and each has a differing opinion. She loves it instantly. He hates it. He wants to sell it. Maybe it's because of the mess of doilies strewn everywhere. He says, ""A man can only take so much lace."" He says, ""I can actually taste the dust."" He says, ""I don't use stairs I can hear."" Okay, the staircase is pretty creaky. There's a goat in the yard, and, it turns out, Brian may be allergic to goats. Jenny will name the goat Gabby. Brian will go away.

But not before agreeing to hold off on selling the house, and agreeing to have Jenny buy him out. And then he goes back to New York, leaving Jenny with a fixer-upper. Jenny needs to make some quick cash. She's a mean cook, so she bakes these goodies and hits up all the eateries in town to see if they would sell them.

You knew Brian would be back. Did you know he came back because he got fired and had nowhere else to go. Dude has has only $2,643 in his savings account. He laments that he use to spend that amount on a suit. Here's the sitch: Brian and an angry Jenny are now sharing the house. When Brian's not job hunting, he's getting his hands dirty having a go at carpentry, plumbing, goat herding, painting, you name it. And maybe his MBA from Wharton does come in handy (I don't know how), because he manages to make the water pipes sing (literally!) and he and Jenny are able to come to an accord with what color to paint the house (a non-competitive seafoam mint, thanks very much). Honestly, I didn't use to be a fan of Brennan Elliott because he used to play these jerks. And I didn't have much use for him early in the movie. But I have to say that he grew on me.

Can a New York hotshot settle down in rural contentment? Can Jenny pull off her dream of converting the house into a bed & breakfast, a dream readjusted from her long-cherished aspiration to open her own restaurant? Lacey Chabert is so easy to like, and you can grow to like Brennan Elliott. They spark when onscreen together. But it's only the two leads rowing the boat. They've got help from a bunch of capable character actors, from Barbara Pollard who plays Jenny's sweet, old neighbor Alice, to Heather Doerksen who plays the cafe waitress Casey, and Daniel Cudmore, whose towering side character of Tom is a favorite of mine. Surprisingly, Tom, a man of few words who operates the general store, becomes the guy Brian turns to for advice. Jenny's ex-boyfriend Daryl is played by a guy named Greyston Holt, and having ""Greyston Holt"" for a name only makes me dislike the guy even more. Alright, to be honest, Daryl isn't that bad of a person. He soon enough realizes how much he'd goofed. Too late, Daryl.

Also, there are scenes of Ed Asner sitting on the bench outside the general store. He'd say stuff to people as they walked by.

Jenny and Brian. Her absurd contentment drives him up the wall. She says he's allergic to life. From jump, they don't seem compatible. Except they are. And no amount of throwing stupid eleventh-hour obstacles in their way will prevent these two from getting together. You could say it's fate. To support that, the final scene even breaks down to a sort of Greek chorus that sums up the narrative. ""They divided the house in two. You can only had to look at them to know that wouldn't last.""

Now, on to the sequel, All of My Heart: Inn Love, that just aired this past Sunday on Hallmark. I just want to make sure the goat is okay.

In this offering, a caterer (Lacey Chabert) has dreams that are instantly fulfilled when she inherits an old house in the middle of nowhere.  She wants to turn it into a bed & breakfast.  The only obstacle is the Wall Street trader (Brennan Elliott) who inherited the other half and he wants to sell it.  She thinks its charming, he thinks its a wreck (hes closer to the truth as it is a fixer-upper).  At first all is going well, shes shy a load (a disappointing ex-boyfriend) and ready to cook her way into a better life.  The opposite is true for the Wall Street trader who shows up on their stoop, needing a place to stay.  The expected happens, they bicker, they ruin their front porch with paint, they obsess over a goat that isn't theirs, and then they have a ""sanding"" moment thats suppose to be electric.  Its not.  While Chabert applies her usual charm, the same cannot be said about Elliott.  As for the intrusion of Ed Asner, he just sits there and says a few lines like some ducks were never meant to fly.  Why hes there is never explained.  As romances go, this one is typical of its type, offering absolutely nothing new or unexpected.
 I only liked it because it featured Lacey Chabet, otherwise, eh.",1489276800,2,1333,4.477178423236515

I would put these at the top of ""The Best Hallmark Movies list""  ""Princess for Christmas"", ""All Of My Heart"", ""Recipe For Love"", "" The Good Witch"" series, ""Just Desserts"", And "" Signed, Sealed, Delivered"". Of course there are still the movie mysteries and I haven't seen all of the movies they've made, but these would still be at the top. I hope they continue making even better movies to come!

They fall in love quietly not telling each other how they feel.  It all works out in the end.  To me the star of the show was Gabby.  She stole my heart and her little Kids are so cute.

So here it is: this movie is AWESOME! :) Not cheesy. Not badly acted or directed. Great budget. Great story.
Instead of the usual love-triangle where the old boyfriend is the city-slicker and the new guy's a lumberjack (or something like that), both fellas are successful business men - although, our hero (Brian) steals women's hearts from early on in the movie. And instead of our heroin leaving a complicated life in the city, she has a funny like-able boss and quits her job only when she finds out she's inherited half a house. Yeah, HALF a house. . .

7464307,5,B01690GTK4,"Love this movie!  I've watched it several times over last year so I'm glad the DVD has been released.  It's funny, I was telling a friend of mine about what our favorite Hallmark movies are last Fall  and I mentioned this one and she said she has it recorded on her DVR and watches it every evening.  She even said her husband doesn't mind watching it over & over because it's so funny.  I love Lacey and Brennan together.  Such sweet chemistry!  And the way he delivers his line has me laughing.  I was happy to see them again in their Christmas movie last month.  The whole cast is great. There are so many funny lines & moments throughout the movie.  They've been putting out  a lot of movies on Hallmark which I'm so glad because I can watch them with my whole family and know they are appropriate and have good messages.  Sometimes the leads don't have enough chemistry but they hit a touchdown with pairing up Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliot.",1453248000,34,949,4.421965317919075

The story is interesting and warm and the performances by Lacey Chabert and Brennan Elliot are great. The supporting performances are also very good, and really add to the story. Chabert and Elliot have a terrific chemistry and I was glad to see that they worked together again recently on another very enjoyable Hallmark production, A Christmas Melody. All of My Heart is really a sweet and very charming movie that will make you smile and laugh...What could be better? Definitely a keeper.",1452556800,10,626,4.752293577981652

8735905,1,B01690GTK4,"I will start by saying that I LOVE the first movie.  It's adorable and one of my favorite Hallmark movies ever.  I was super excited for a sequel.  Unfortunately, this sequel was SOOOOOO disappointing!  It's basically a badly done remake of the first movie.  Same plot, same relationship and business issues as the first movie.  They didn't even try to get a house that looks remotely like the one they used in the first movie.  Plus it's said that the main characters have sunk all of their savings into remodeling the house and the roof leaks??????  Why wasn't that the very first thing that they did when they remodeled?!  Everyone knows that's what you do.

SPOILER ALERT:  They breakup and get back together at the end of the movie..............IT WAS SO DUMB.  A third movie is being made with them actually getting married this time, and I am PRAYING it's as good as the first one.  Hopefully I can just pretend like Inn Love was never made!",1535414400,,948,4.604790419161676
