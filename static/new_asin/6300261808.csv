301672,2,6300261808,"""Lurid"" is close, but still doesn't begin to describe this messed-up horror/exorcism movie. Beginning in the cellar of a convent, a nun who has lost her way stumbles into a gruesome chamber where another nun is busy mutilating a dead body in a rather less than professional manner. The crazed ""surgeon"" nun raves for a while about demonic possession and the sins of the flesh, and after thrusting her knife into the bloody groin of the corpse, she stabs the terrified intruder to death. The opening credits then roll over pretty shots of the other sisters about their peaceful business, leaving the viewer slightly shell-shocked, probably wondering how such depravities are going to be concealed/explained/topped throughout the rest of the movie.

Well don't hold your breath. ""The Other Hell"" is a garbled mixture of occasional graphic imagery, wild acting and terrible scripting. The events on screen seem completely unconnected to each other a lot of the time, but the story basically follows an investigation into the weird supernatural happenings at the convent, and why so many of the nuns in the convent keep on dying, but it's pretty hard to apply normal logic to the story when it's not presented in any believable way. Anyway, a high ranking clergyman visits the convent in attempt to purify it, and he ends up getting burned to a crisp pretty promptly. Then the church authorities send another - younger and more handsome - priest to replace him without any fuss at all. This newcomer, Father Valerio, is a bit feistier and soon finds a lot of awfully suspicious goings-on, such as the basement charnel house where the mad nun is still crazily carving up dead bodies un-checked, despite having just murdered one of the nuns.  And how about that cobwebby attic full of suspended child-sized dolls? Oh yes and the severed head of the first priest that turns up at the altar. This all looks very suspicious to say the least (!) but when the Mother Superior tells Father Valerio everything is fine and to stop meddling, that seems to be it, and we move on to the next nasty event. I think there is some mention about the church preferring to hush up it's own dirty goings on, rather than expose them to the police, which would have been far more interesting if explored further, but it's scarcely enlarged on, thus leaving the various horrors of the convent to just carry on unchecked with no sight of any resolve. This is not, of course, until a hilarious flashback shows us the true source of the malevolent presence and the person behind it all is finally revealed.

Despite some great imagery, such as the delapidated convent interiors, especially the room full of hanging dolls, most of the shock scenes are flubbed. Scenes of hysterical nuns falling out of closets or running hither and thither have no shock value after been seen for the third time. A vague glimpse of some kind of demon manifestation proves to be something like two red lights in a shapeless mound of modelling clay. Worst of all is the big flashback ""reveal""  -  an attempted infanticide  - which is laughable. Firstly because of a really stupid attempt to suggest that Father Valerio is watching the flashback as somehow supernaturally recorded on his reel-to-reel audio tape recorder!! Secondly, the pivotal close up of the (live) baby's ""evil stare"" is done using a rubber doll's head with a plastic eye. I can't believe this was seen in the rushes and passed as acceptable, it's so inept! About the only scene that does work is the opening, what a shame the film did not manage to keep up the mood of depravity suggested in this opening 10 minutes.

At least the film does a decent job of staging the mayhem: as mentioned before, the action is all filmed in a great crumbling location. And the odd-looking Franca Stoppi ( who played Iris in ""Beyond the Darkness"") does a reasonably good job as the Mother Superior, with several scenes of manic face-pulling. But ultimately it's just too poorly put together to work. Even the score fails the film - a recycled Goblin-style synthsized job, that was somehow deemed appropriate for a film about nuns and demonic possession (it isn't), is repeated over and over to little effect, in fact it even sounds identical to the one used for ""Beyond the Darkness"", and I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same one. Not one event is believable or convincing, and when the film is trying to hit the hardest is when it fails the most spectacularly.",1159228800,3,4468,4.772315653298835
301673,2,6300261808,"There is no other way to say it: Bruno Mattei is a hack. He's the sultan of schlock, the duke of dreck, the prince of pap as far as films go. His pictures move at a breakneck crawl, his actors ply their craft with the stolid assuredness of cigar store Indians, and the plotlines reek of unoriginality. I'm fairly convinced at this point that Mattei's middle initial is 'D' for ""Derivative."" A horror film hasn't been made that Mattei wouldn't shamelessly rip-off for a cheap buck. You want zombie pictures? Mattei's been there and done that. Interested in the women in prison subgenre? Mattei made ""Violence in a Women's Prison"" to capitalize on the babes behind bars phenomenon. Do you like critters run amok flicks? Welcome to Bruno Mattei's ""Rats,"" not so much a knock off as a collection of cliches stuck together with scotch tape. Good old Bruno has done it all, from action films to exploitation epics. ""The Other Hell"" falls under the rubric of ""nunsploitation,"" a bizarre horror subgenre that sees nuns going on insanity fueled killing sprees after some hidden evil possesses their souls. In true exploitation fashion, the levels of violence and bare flesh achieve sky-high levels. Italians have a weird relationship with the Catholic Church, that's for sure.

""The Other Hell"" introduces us to a convent of nuns in turmoil. A series of bloody yet mysterious murders has all the sisters blaming the influence of Satan. There is good reason for this assertion considering what's been going on in the basement of the convent. A laboratory that would make Dr. Frankenstein drool with envy bubbles and churns away down there. It must be some sort of black magic laboratory too, since we can read several sinister Latin phrases etched into the walls and see some wicked looking lights flare up from time to time. Even better, this chamber houses the coffins of deceased nuns who once lived in the cloister above. The first time we see this place is when a mother superior performs a ghastly surgery on another nun. Hmmm. I wonder if this bloody operation has any connection with the killings that eventually occur in the world above? Mattei tries to keep us intentionally in the dark about that, although I suspect the murky script--probably written by a roomful of monkeys banging away on typewriters--bears just as much responsibility for any initial confusion. Anyway, the killings send the sisters into quite a dither, so much so that the Church authorities decide to send in Father Valerio (Carlo De Mejo) to investigate.

Valerio runs into many problems immediately upon beginning his inquiry. His main difficulty arrives in the form of the current mother superior (Franca Stoppi), a stony faced woman who rules her roost with an iron crucifix. The tumult in the convent doesn't faze this hardened nun for a second, and she's convinced something evil is afoot in her domain. She's also convinced that she can solve the problem herself without any outside interference. Problem is, her solutions involve scaring the nuns senseless, and even going so far as to order them to burn items ""tainted"" with the spirit of evil. Another problem is Bruno, the odd chap who acts as the convent's gardener and who also cares for a bunch of vicious dogs nearby. Father Valerio has a run in with this guy right away, and he will pop up at various times to serve as yet another suspect to the strange goings on in the convent. Until the dogs turn him into hamburger with a little help from an outside influence, that is. What exactly is going on here? I won't spoil the (cough cough) surprise, but Mattei reveals all in a predictably clunky way as the movie shudders to a gasping halt. I've only got one small question to ask about this film: was that a melted chocolate bar on that girl's face?

Why oh why was this film made? I'll admit I usually get a strange charge out of watching a Bruno Mattei movie. His pictures are such monuments to bad filmmaking that those of us who love watching schlock cinema just can't seem to find enough guys like Bruno. But why this film emerged when it did is a mystery to me. I thought the nunsploitation phenomenon ran its course several years earlier. Usually, hacks are the first ones to jump immediately on any successful bandwagon. Not in this case, I guess. Surprisingly, the set pieces--primarily the convent--look good and set a nice gloomy tone for the movie. The performances aren't too bad, with Carlo De Mejo doing the best job, but the dialogue is wooden and many of the scenes are utterly ridiculous. Moreover, Mattei ripped off the Goblin score from D'Amato's ""Buio Omega."" It's going to be tough, but try not to ask questions such as the following while watching the film: why not just close the convent down and move the nuns out until a thorough investigation clears up the problems? Why would the Church risk potentially bad press by keeping the nuns together? Why is a movie this bad available to the general public? These questions, and a few others, will keep you occupied as you trudge through the convoluted mess that is ""The Other Hell.""

Look at all these extras! An interview with Mattei, one with De Mejo, and trailers for ""The Other Hell,"" ""Demonia,"" ""Hitcher in the Dark,"" ""Zombie 3,"" and ""Violence in a Woman's Prison"" in part seek to explain the Mattei experience to a mystified world. The only thing I garnered from the two interviews is that De Mejo is a rather odd duck in real life, more interested in cracking kooky smiles and reminiscing about Italian geography than discussing anything relevant to the film in a coherent way. Give ""The Other Hell"" a shot if you like schlock. All others should stay away.",1107907200,,5674,4.757360406091371
301674,3,6300261808,"In this 1980 film by Bruno Mattei, a young priest, played by Carlo De Mejo (Contamination, City of the Living Dead), is sent to a convent to investigate a series of bizarre and brutal murders.  The nuns think Satan is to blame; the priest thinks the murders are the work of a psychopath.  The truth turns out to be something in between.
The Other Hell has just about everything you could ever want in an Italian horror film: stylish direction by Mattei, a stunning performance by Franca Stoppi (who was even more brilliant in Joe D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness), and a pulse-pounding score by Goblin.  Although not the very best of the genre, it's still a solid offering, and a worthy addition to any Italian-horror buff's DVD collection.
As always, Shriek Show delivers a solid product.  The film transfer is surprisingly good, especially considering that it was shot in 16mm and blown up to 35mm.  Although the sound is monaural, it's generally clear throughout.  The DVD features a host of nice extras, too, including revealing interviews with Mattei and De Mejo and trailers from other Shriek Show DVD's.

This time, the devil is loose in the convent, causing madness and bloody murder to reign. Director Bruno Mattei fills his film w/ gore and macabre trappings bathed in red and green light. If Bava or Argento made these type of movies, they'd probably look a lot like this. Far more serious and grim than most such epics, THE OTHER HELL plays up the horror aspects as much as the exploitative. Dreadful images and set pieces help to create a bleak atmosphere of doom. Yes, nuns do go wild, but in a demonic frenzy, as opposed to the usual lustful abandon. Religious symbols are used to great effect, adding a nice backdrop for the supernatural / satanic assault. Unlike many ""devil movies"" of the time period, TOH actually generates a sense of evil, instead of the expected cheeeze. Well, ok, there is a bit of cheeeze. Still, never has a nunnery been more terrifying! In addition, there are gore-splattered scenes that Fulci himself would admire! Also, watch for the cat, the owl, the bat, and the faceless nun!

301702,2,6300261808,"This Italian horror fails to deliver the gore we've come to expect and is directed so poorly it's about unwatchable.  But I won't lie, I was somewhat entertained by its level of bonkers nonsense.  SIDEBAR:  Also marketed as Guardian of Hell, this Italian film was originally titled L'altro inferno.

80s Italian horror has a way of catering to our inner perverted intoxicated teenager.  It's always so over-the-top.  Not five minutes into this movie and we see a hot topless dead nun on an altar in some sort of alchemical laboratory.  An overly sanctimonious nun mutilates the attractive body's genitals while reciting zealous rantings about the Devil and the vagina being a gate to Hell.  Normally this would serve as a reliable sign that this would be one of those so bad it's good gory Italian sensations.  Sadly, this submission falls short.

""Bonkers"" would best describe the storytelling style of this film.  Nuns go crazy, randomly show up dead and kill people, a priest spontaneously combusts, house pets become evil, there are a few strangulations and stabbings, and there is hardly any sense of sound explanation or pacing.  Put simply: weird stuff happens, then we watch some filler scene that neither explains what happened nor establishes the events to come, then more weird stuff happensthen just wash, rinse and repeat until you run out of running time, adding over-the-top acting, terrible writing and provocative imagery as necessary.

After several inexplicable murders occur at a convent, the somewhat young Father Valerio (Carlo de Mejo; City of the Living Dead, The House by the Cemetery, Contamination, Manhattan Baby) is sent to investigate.  His faith is tested with temptation and his sanity is tested by the chaotic script.  I'd explain the plot more buthonestly, it was hard to keep track of what the Hell was going on.

Director Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead, Zombi 3) seems to try and fail to capture the off-the-cuff tangential stylings of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci.  Even though neither of them were terribly talented storytellers, their direction was slightly less erratic (most of the time, LOL).  You practically could have randomly ordered the scenes of this movie without reducing the followability of this senseless plot.  For all I know, that may be exactly what the editor did!

The effects are weak and the gore is minimal, especially for an installment in Italian horror.  Not sure why.  Maybe red paint and chicken livers weren't on sale that week.  Just to be clear, you all agree that 70s and 80s Italian horror appeared to simply use red paint and butcher's trimmings as blood and guts, right?  Super thick and bright red with a few random chunks.  Normally crazy gore is what makes these Italian films fun and watchable.  Perhaps that's likewise why this film was so disappointing.

I enjoyed bits here and there and, I must admit, I was somewhat entertained.  So while I'm not specifically going to recommend this to anyone, I won't warn off any adventurous horror fans either.",1394841600,,3037,4.9840954274353875
301703,1,6300261808,"L'Altro Inferno (The Other Hell) (Bruno Mattei, 1981)

You've heard of The Asylum, yes? It's an American production house that for a while turned out decent indie pictures, every once in a while coming up with a really, really good one. But roundabout 2006 or so, they realized that for a low-budget shop, the real money was in no-name knockoffs of blockbuster picturesand thus, the Asylum Mockbuster was born. They have turned into a one-studio mockbuster cottage industry. And you know what? Pretty much every movie The Asylum has released since Halloween Night, their first successful mockbuster, has been reviled both critically and popularly...but The Asylum are laughing all the way to the bank, because no matter how much we hate the stupid things, we keep watching them. But you didn't think The Asylum invented the idea, do you? If so, let me introduce you to Bruno Mattei, a one-man mockbuster factory who spent thirty years making bank by ripping off other people's work. His third feature, 1977's Casa Privata per le SS, is a shameless ripoff of the Ilsa movies, and his final picture, 2007's Zombies: The Beginning, was an equally shameless Aliens rip. In the interim, he paid homage to just about every horror and exploitation film you can think of. 1981's The Other Hell, Mattei's entry into the wonderful nunsploitation genre, mixes equal parts The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine (1974) and Killer Nun (1977) to come up with something that is just about as original as the first half of this sentence would have you believe.

Plot: A priest, Father Valerio (Teorema's Carlo de Mejo), is sent by the Vatican to investigate allegations of dark and twisted goings-on at the convent run by Mother Vincenza (Buio Omega's Francesca Stoppi). Needless to say, the allegations are true, or we wouldn't have a movie. (Or if we did, it wouldn't be a nunsploitation movie.)

The parenthetical there is pretty much the entire problem with this movie (other than, well, it being a shameless rip-off of better movies in the genre); if you hit the play button on a nunsploitation flick, there are certain things that, if you know the genre, you're expecting, two of which are the first two parts of Joe Bob Briggs' three-Bs trilogy of things that make a good movie. Mattei's lackluster entry has very little blood and almost nothing in the way of breasts (and not even any random beasts to balance this out). Combine that with the expected mind-shatteringly awful script and what do you have? The nunsploitation movie you should only consider watching when you have exhausted every other choice in the nunsploitation catalogue, that's what. *",1389398400,,2640,4.928089887640449
301704,3,6300261808,"Going into this movie I expected the worst; a lot of people admire the work of Claudio Fragasso & Bruno Mettei because of the whole so bad it's good. Personally I never really cared for either of them. There are plenty of movies I find so bad its good, but the work of Fragasso and Mettei for me are just bad with moments that I like.

If not mistaken The Other Hell is the first time these two guys worked together and it's kinda of fitting they formed a partnership isn't it? You name it Bruno Mettei & Claudio Fragasso ripped it off for this movie. They take pieces of other popular horror flicks and find ways to work it into The Other Hell.

If you hear the score and think to yourself I have heard this before, well you have. The score by Goblin is taken directly from the Joe D'Amato classic Beyond the Darkness. Normally a composer will come in and come up with a score a lot like another movie, but offer some changes, but Mettei and Fragasso would rather have the real thing.

When it comes to music composed in horror movies you'll be hard pressed to find a better score than ones done by Goblin and Beyond the Darkness was one of their very best, so at least they knocked off the right movie.

The screenplay by Claudio Fragasso is one of his better ones, but that isn't saying much seeing as I don't think Fragasso has ever actually had a well written movie. His screenplays range from the so bad it's good to just downright bad. The screenplay actually has some fairly decent moments and isn't a complete waste.

Bruno Mettei made a career of making movies that were rather bad, but with that said, that is why he was so popular with horror fans. His movies were bad, but they were also a lot of fun.

As I stated before I was never the biggest fan of Bruno Mettei some of his flicks were fun, but as a whole I didn't have as much fun watching them as other people. But I have to give him some credit here; The Other Hell isn't nearly as bad as you would think. There are plenty of moments of bad filmmaking, but Mettei actually made a fairly decent movie.

Some scenes might have even been a little creepy, which is more due to the fantastic location and the great score by Goblin than it was Mattei's directing. But I'll still give Bruno Mettei some credit here; he actually was able to put together a fairly decent movie with some nice moments. But the biggest problem with the movie is The Other Hell is just too slow at times.

There are long stretches when nothing really interesting happens; by the 45-minute mark I felt as if the movie had been on a lot longer and that is never a good thing. Bruno Mettei tries to build some tension and atmosphere and have that drive the movie, but The Other Hell wasn't written well enough or well enough made for the movie to depend on that.

If The Other Hell had a couple of more action scenes mixed in the movie would have been a lot better. Despite the flaws, like I said this wasn't a badly made movie in general.

It's a Bruno Mettei & Claudio Fragasso movie so there are bound to be moments of bad filmmaking, but as a whole not as many as you would think. Had there been more action even if just one or two more scenes it would have greatly helped the movie.

Franca Stoppi best known for Joe D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness gives another strange and over the top, but creepy performance. Any scene Stoppi is in very much works to the advantage of The Other Hell. Carlo De Mejo also proves a fairly good performance and like Stoppi helps elevate The Other Hell.

In closing, The Other Hell isn't your typical Mettei & Fragasso movie; the idea for the movie is actually pretty good and the execution was just a bit off at times.

Fans of either Mettei & Fragasso or Italian horror in general might wanna give this one a chance. Far from a classic of the genre, but it does provide some decent moments, but filled up with too many boring moments.

The Italian director is known in some circles as The Italian Ed Wood, and for good reason; he is renowned for consistently using stock footage, soundtracks from other films, horrible acting, and eye-rolling dialogue.  But youd be hard-pressed to find somebody who does exploitation better.

THE OTHER HELL is one of his forays into Nunsploitation films, and its a doozy.  Its not a great film, but it is certainly entertaining.  And while I find his zombie films much more fun, I still have to suggest to you to give this one a lookthat is, if you like this sort of stuff (and thankfully, I do!).

The cover of the Blu-ray, as shown above, is a duel-sided beauty that lets you choose how you want to display the film on your shelf.  I personally love the skeletal nun, as it is much more provocative and mysterious.

THE OTHER HELL is shot well and looks very good onscreen, thanks to the HD restoration.  I like the story of how a 35mm print of the film was found behind a false wall in a nunnery in Bologna; it makes the film even more interesting for me.  And, thanks to the discovery, a true upgrade was given to the picture and sound.  Both are impressive, and I will state Blu-ray is definitely the way to see the film.

The acting is wooden and stiff, which are typical traits of a Mattei film.  Those of you who have experienced his films in the past know what Im talking aboutbut if this is your first time, do not expect much in regard to the cast.  Thankfully, it is also a part of the films, uh, charm, so its easily sidestepped.

The special effects in THE OTHER HELL are pretty laughable.  The bit of gore we get is recycled, and the other effects (such as the baby in the flashback) are so obviously fake, its hard to watch them with a straight face.  But still, schlocky is what Mattei is famous for, therefore its no surprise to see them as such.

The storyline in THE OTHER HELL is a confusing mish-mash of several Nunsploitation films.  Theres a singular plotline that peeks through, but it is never really fleshed out well enough to reveal its intentions.  And when the Big Reveal is shown, it comes across as more of a joke than anything.

Still, if you are fan of Matteis work (and I am), this film will definitely merit watching.  Its full of all the campy, cheezy stuff weve come to expect from the legendary filmmakers works, and it fits right in with the rest of his filmography.  I personally loved it, and Ill probably give it another viewing later on.",1495670400,3,2589,4.427061310782241

7808607,4,6300261808,"The illustrious Severin Films released 2 obscure nunsploitation anomalies on the same day; Mariano Baino's Dark Waters and Bruno Mattei's The Other Hell.

Bruno Mattei is a trash-master of schlocky Italian films. He's the guy who rips off the rip offs. In terms of horror cheese, if Romero is aged artisan cheddar, Fulci is nacho cheese, and Mattei is a can of cheez whiz.

This film is a crummy nunsploitation film for hardcore bad movie aficionados; the kind of horror junkies who dig Zombie 3-5, Jess Franco's 80s output, and obscure Italian flicks by guys like Fragasso, D'Amato, Bianchi, and late era Fulci. Know what you're getting into folks; this is NOT action packed killer nunnery. At times, there's so much padding you expect to see it named in the credits. But like most movies of its ilk, TOH is not without its gravy. Charmingly inept and cheaply made, this schlock fest is lazily stuffed with bad dialogue, LOL-inducing practical FX, lowbrow blasphemy, and dusty atmosphere. Carlo de Mejo stars for crying out loud! Quite possibly the most wooden actor in all of Italian horror, he's in some of the genre's finest titles (City of the Living Dead, Contamination), but was usually only hired because he was the son of Suspiria star Alida Valli (Suspiria). Filmed on an actual convent, the old monastery brings a much-needed believability to the film, especially scenes that take place in the basement, where limbless dolls dangle from ropes, and an ancient red-eyed evil lurks in darkness, exuding waves of chaos and terror throughout the convent.

At the heart of the film, underneath the padding, lame dialogue, and cheaply-effective imagery, is a mediocre murder mystery involving whacked clergy, possessed mutts, the archetypal ""someone-or-something"", and a mysterious nun. Traditionally, killer nun flicks are loaded with lesbian sleaze, but Bruno Mattei tones that down in favor of supernatural horror and giallo elements.

Bottom line: if you're a fan of this stuff, you'll appreciate The Other Hell, especially Severin's blu release. I own the Shriek Show dvd but I'm definitely going to double dip this.

(Also, check out Dark Waters, another solid nunsploitation flick with some sweet nods to Argento and Fulci)
