6389176,4,B00JRB01AC,"My son is in love with the wiggles and we have to watch one of their videos everyday including this one. However after watching the videos so much I have noticed that the wiggles have some inconsistencies and odd costume choices throughout. It's weird because they will put so much effort in one song and then you can tell that toward the end of production they are like ""lets just get something to fill the space""

Example: They have a beautiful Irish dancing dress for Emma in one number, but in another where she dances ballet she does the number on an uneven ground in her wiggles costume. And then they dress Anthony as ""the king"" in the ABC song but in an elvis costume and a crown, Mixed metaphors!

Another issue I have is location scouting. I love the real locations  but sometimes they make no sense. The sang the fish song near a lovely fish pond but then they have a musical number shot next to a semi truck? Did they get board on tour?

Oh and even my two year know that in the Pufferbillies song Anthony is trying to drive the caboose with the hand break. You all share the the children's entertainment world with Thomas the Tank Engine give the kids some credit.

I know these are first world problems and that despite these issues we will continue to watch Wiggles video's and listen to their CD's . Their songs are enchanting and the dance moves are easy for our toddler to follow.  We love the Wiggles and will love them for a long time to come.",1412380800,3,1463,4.360294117647059

6389181,4,B00JRB01AC,"We just got The Wiggles: Apples and Bananas. So much fun! My 4 year old girl loves it! She loves the apples and bananas song. She sings it all the time. We watched it while house sitting for a friend. She was thoroughly involved. My 2 year old son, on the other hand, watched it for maybe 10 minutes and then ran off trying to find something else to do. So I would say the older toddlers will probably like it more than the younger ones. As a mom, I like it a lot because it's entertaining as well as teaching.",1408406400,4,510,4.0594059405940595

My son has been introduced to tv he is loving the Wiggles so when we were sent Apples & Bananas for review I knew he would love it. He always sings Apples & Bananas as soon as the DVD comes on, its one of the first songs.

He also loves Shortnin Bread, he loves when I sing along with him. I have always been a big fan of the Wiggles, in this DVD is all the new characters. My daughter is so thrilled to see a girl in the group!

I love that the Wiggles teaches him songs, at 18 months he catches on quite well. He always walks up to his tv and says momma tv so he can watch the Wiggles.

You can find this DVD along with lots of other wonderful DVD's offered by NCircle on their website www. NCircleEntertainment.com and at their local retailers.",1407801600,2,1588,4.399317406143345

My Review:

 My children range in age of 4 all the way up to 17 and every single one of them have always been HUGE fans of The Wiggles. The Wiggles have been around for a long time. Not too long ago they added a girl to the group and their happy singing has continued on to reach many more children. In their latest DVD by the famed NCircle Entertainment, Apples&Bananas will soon become a family favorite upon it's release on August 29th. The reason is so obvious yet exciting, it is a DVD full of 22 songs that are all about a wiggly collection of nursery rhymes.

 Some of the nursery rhymes included are Itsy Bitsy Spider, Apples&Bananas, Shortin' Bread, and The Wheels on the Bus just to name a few. My son is really in to these songs right now and he absolutely adores this DVD. The DVD will be available here and at your local retailers.

6389219,3,B00JRB01AC,"Good, but in this mom's opinion... not as great as the wiggle house edition. The toons just aren't quite as catchy. It is still worthy of purchasing though.

I'm still a fan of the one hour format with not too much time between songs. Songs like 'Apples and Bananas' deliver the expected fun. Some songs lack - like the song about the sleeping princess who gets kissed and then lives happily ever after.

Saying that - my son loves the Wiggles regardless. So, it was a good purchase for changing things up a bit. But be warned - you'll be singing the songs in your head all day. Such is life with a toddler.",1464048000,,607,4.315789473684211

From the time my son was 18 months the only thing he ever watched and responded to on TV was the Wiggles.

Most importantly, they understand what is happening on the screen but are not overwhelmed by it. I've noticed that a lot of programs for the toddler age range either over-stimulate the kids or bore them half to death... or have weird gender roles in them. The Wiggles is completely appropriate and very engaging. Just perfect!",1456012800,,479,4.714285714285714

6389290,2,B00JRB01AC,"Couple cute songs but this is the worst production of all the wiggles videos released. Seems rushed like an album a record producer pushed to get out to meet a deadline from investors. Cheap sets like a couple behind a building. Seems like they made it in their spare time when touring at wherever they stopped at. Behind a McDonald's or in a fried, etc. Lots of rehashed tunes as well. The older stuff is WAY better.",1422921600,,417,4.428571428571429

6389293,2,B00JRB01AC,"Just okay video in the Wiggles oeuvre. Seems like they're getting more lazy progressively with each new video. Production quality is lower. This one contains a few songs they've done before but without any noticeable improvement. They don't use backup dancers like they used to. Captain Feathersword is mostly absent, which takes away a measure of the fun present in other videos. Some of the settings are random and lazy like the semi-truck parked behind them as they dance around it. Some settings are reused, as well. I question a number of filming/cinematographic choices like shooting in direct sunlight. Overall, my two year old doesn't care or notice but I do and see a decline in quality. Still, it's a fun video and my daughter enjoys watching it - probably what's most important!",1420329600,,789,4.93984962406015

6389295,4,B00JRB01AC,"This is a typical Wiggles DVD, so of course my three year old daughter loves it.  For some reason, Lochy's hair looks ridiculous (compared to their previous few DVDs).  And Emma is obviously wearing a wig (a bad one at that).  Why?  They are both distracting from the music.  Sometimes they perform a song outside in front of some kind of landmark, and other times they are just out in the parking lot, or in front of a semi-truck for no apparent reason.  With all the money they make, you would think they could afford to put a little more effort into production issues like that.  Captain Feathersword is sorely underused as well: don't blink or you'll miss him.",1419811200,,664,4.529411764705882

If you watch the TV show (on Sprout) the songs are similar but completely new to us (which is awesome since you won't have repeats). They are just as addicting and they include some wise cracks in it for adults (they wonder who could possibly be over 50 years old and play the old man in ""This old man""). Overall great DVD. Perfect for road trips and it has a rapid pace between music videos to keep even my almost 2 year old happy.",1416873600,,519,4.2
