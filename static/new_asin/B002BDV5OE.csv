3893026,5,B002BDV5OE,"Can't wait to see what extras are on the DVD. Saw the HBO special several times and loved it, got funnier every time. Like some of the greats, Carlin, Pryor and so on he is able to make his vulgarity work for him so that he doesn't sound like so many other comics, just being vulgar and offensive for the sheer shock of it. It comes across as natural, as if it is just who he is and how he sees the world. No one is safe from ridicule, even himself. I can't recommend this special enough. One of the freshest minds in comedy since Eddie Izzard.",1252195200,21,544,4.093457943925234

The first half I laughed out loud watching it alone, when I usually just laugh on the inside, so it had some pretty good moments.  At the end it got disgusting without being particularly funny.  I'm all for disgusting if it's funny, but without the funny it's just gross.  Certainly worth a watch for a few good laughs.",1501200000,,383,4.352112676056338

3893043,2,B002BDV5OE,"I decided to check out ""I Swear to God"" because, out of all the comics interviewed in the mostly monotonous Misery Loves Comedy, Jim Jefferies seemed to have some of the funniest responses. Sadly, I saw little evidence of that originality here.

""I Swear to God"" leans hard on stand-up stand-bys--sex, drugs, fat people, religion, rape, foreigners--Jefferies' takes on these topics are as formulaic as the set list.  Even when a joke's set-up calls attention to a particular comedic convention (""Every comic who has a Muslim joke does a terrorist joke""), he makes no effort to take it in a different direction (""You take bacon and beer away from me, and I'd fly a plane into a building, too""). The vignettes drawn from his personal experience seem more promising, but eventually they disintegrate into stock characters and situations, too.

I will freely admit that I prefer comedy that ""punches up"" more than ""punching down,"" but the best comedians seem to find ways of using this sort of self-righteous indignation to their advantage--revealing that a joke they've just told is only offensive if you were making certain stereotypical assumptions to start with, for instance. Jefferies seems to take the exact opposite approach: his bits develop exactly the way you expect them to, with very few surprises. After the first half, I started jumping around to see if the set got any more interesting, and ended up turning it off early--not because I was offended, but because I was falling asleep.",1496880000,,1495,4.995983935742972

3893046,5,B002BDV5OE,"I inadvertently did a review on Days and  Beautiful and Clouds film, not Jim Jefferies!
Shot beautifully.  The love between the protagonists is not broken because of financial circumstances, which is never the focal point.  It's interesting  to watch the reactions and dismay without loosing hope or affecting the relationship between the husband and wife.
At times I found him the ""weak link,"" and that the wife carried them through difficult times, even though she  was a stay at home mom, while he built his business, but found her strength when he lost his pride.
Lovely to see a film wonderfully drawn on every day experiences of love, failure, and love.",1491955200,,659,4.900900900900901

3893048,4,B002BDV5OE,"I found his standup to be funny, but not everyone will. His last bit of this set takes a turn towards scatological humor that many may not like. But to me, good humor is always willing to take a subject you are uncomfortable with and make it humorous.",1488758400,,251,4.25

If you begin this special and quit after three or four minutes, because its too offensive, then you are a child unable to handle grown up themes. Watch this special all the way through, and you will laugh until you cant breathe. Jim Jefferies begins with his routine with a few self-depreciation jokes and ends with a hilarious story about an exciting trip to Amsterdam; between these two parts, he jokes about the absurdity of religion, the banality of sex, the horror of life, and his dysfunctional family. A must see for any fans of comedy or for any human being.",1463270400,2,808,4.697183098591549

NOPE I loved it because Jim is an insanely good story teller and has this charm that supercedes the filthiness of his material. Its also hilarious, which I guess should have been first sentence I wrote for this review.

3893453,4,B002BDV5OE,"on the front half of his show, jeffries brought something very fresh to standup.  he explored Christianity, believing in God, our need for an afterlife, and so forth with great panache and style.  I just loved this part of the show and I applaud him for it.  He moved on from there to his family, which I also really enjoyed. However, for the back half of the show he explored sex and bathroom humor, which included one long story about removing an egg from his rectum.  Sex and bathroom humor sells but I am really tired of it.  There is almost nothing new you can do here.  His trip to the porn warehouse was somewhat amusing since I didn't know there was such a place.  However, his real strength is his standup about religion and his family (mother, father, brother with its Australian accent since that is where they are all located).  If he stuck to those two, he would have an incredibly fresh and original show.  the first half of the show is five stars so it is well worth watching that.  the back half is at best three stars and for me personally, considerably less.

We thought it would be just another couple of laughs...  I can't speak for my husband, but that first time watching him was the closest to death by laughing I've ever come.  We almost died. We really almost died laughing. I just wish I could watch it over and over again for the first time.  I bought this one off of Amazon, because I wanted to show it to my friends at work... Let's just say they gave it all thumbs up.  I would say Jim Jeffries is the first guy to come along, who has a really up-to-date grasp of the ridiculousness that is our world...

3893468,5,B002BDV5OE,"Jim Jefferies, or Jeffries, as he prefers to use as his stage name, is one of the hottest, funniest comedians performing today. His style of humor is confrontative, ""angry man,"" and very profane. He is an Aussie, and Aussies like to swear and curse like drunken sailors. If you are sensitive to use of the f-word, this is not your kind of comedy. His subjects range from religion, gays and lesbians, ethnic groups, to his own family. But, all his stories are laced with profanities, and probably would gross out more sensitive viewers.

3893470,1,B002BDV5OE,"I had a difficult time understanding what this Australian-born buffoon was saying from the first time he opened his profanity-stained mouth. But I did understand him well enough to hear him openly profess that he is an atheist who arrogantly believes that he is right and everyone else is wrong about there being no God (despite the lingering fact that the non-existence of God has never been proven). At this point, I became very grateful that there were no English subtitles on this DVD since I had no interest in listening to anything else that this dimwitted dunderhead from down under had to say. It was not his being an atheist in and of itself that turned me off so much as his close-minded view that everyone else (like me) who does believe in God is wrong. I have learned to respect the inalienable right of others to believe or not believe in the unseen realities of the spiritual world. I have no interest in turning any hardcore atheist into a spiritual-minded God-knowing truth-seeker but neither will I tolerate listening to any material-minded God-rejecting truth-hater who might be attempting to convert me from monotheism to atheism (especially if this non-believing atheist is a so-called comedian who uses the stage to propagate his anti-God sentiments)! There is just nothing funny about atheistic propaganda. The last thing I heard him say before I merrily clicked on my remote's STOP button to silence this funny little man's pessimistic propaganda forever (at least as far as the realm of my consciousness is concerned) was something about how when we die, there is nothing that happens after that. Perhaps for the non-believing atheist, such a vapid view shall become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I'd rather spend eternity trying to unravel the perplexing mysteries of a God of Love who has invited all of His time-space kids to share an endless journey of discovery and adventure with Him as opposed to being a gutless coward who surrenders to the final sleep of death.",1331251200,7,1993,4.934523809523809

Jefferies has definitely listened to plenty of Bill Hicks' religious material, but adds his own gleefully misogynistic take on things while drinking four pints of lager as the show progresses. All in the name of a good time, mind you, though Jim confesses that he's always hated life and found it dull and pointless. Good start for a comedian!

He seems to have a pretty good time though, even when discussing his lack of endowment down under. His Aussie roots are clear enough from his bashing of the Sheila sub-species, but he's likeable enough to not offend.

He drops the f's constantly, so beware, and if you're easily offended, this will easily offend. But it's worth watching for any fans of honest comedy and uninhibited wrath at all and sundry. There's plenty of truth here, however uncomfortable, and that's always a good thing.",1268956800,,849,4.841379310344828

I see people say he's not politically correct, he is the status quo of PC - only make fun of what is PC to bash and sanctioned by the Left.

8361023,5,B002BDV5OE,"This comedy routine includes jokes about sex, politically incorrect words (including the ""C"" word), and especially religion.  If those things offend you, he is definitely not for you.  It's nothing personal.  I have friends and family members who are offended by those things and I love them.  I would just recommend that they watch Louie Anderson or Gabriel Iglesias for some lighter comedy (while still hilarious).  You have been warned!

If you don't have any trouble laughing at jokes about those topics, this is a must watch.  I thought he was hilarious and insightful.  I will watch this again and recommend it to my friends and family that like this kind of humor.",1521849600,,671,4.876106194690266

He didn't have insight, it just seemed like an angry raving drunk. Just kind of a train wreck, watching a childish drunk bashing those he hates. If you are a dumb person, full of hate, THIS is your comic. I watched and kept waiting for it to get better, and it started just getting depressing and I turned it off.  Comedy is usually a welcome escape from all the oppressiveness and hate in the world, this was like watching all that on a stage. I went looking for something funny to watch after this.",1518825600,,632,4.401709401709402
