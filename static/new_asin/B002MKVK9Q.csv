8544967,5,B002MKVK9Q,"The quality of the prints in this volume 1 is excellent.  Of special interest to Lincoln historians is a short that features the elderly character actor William J. Ferguson in a co-starring role.  Ferguson was a 23 year-old budding actor in the cast of the show Lincoln was watching the night he was assassinated.  It appears to be the only film of him that is readily available.  Ferguson gained some success as a character actor through the ensuing years, and hyped his career with the claim that he witnessed the assassination.  He claimed he was in  the wings with Laura Keene when the shot was fired.  As to whether or not he really eyeballed Lincoln being shot by Booth, I've done a great deal of research on that subject and I now know the answer.",1318118400,3,754,4.54074074074074
