7789577,5,0780623290,"Lovely series, wonderfully animated. The entire show is narrated/played by Denny Doherty of 'Mamas & Papas' fame, and just draws you in with his warmth, humor, and charm. Perfect for anyone, children ... and 'children at heart'! Wish it had been more available to us in the States!",1516233600,,281,4.875

7789579,5,0780623290,"I enjoy the Theodore Tugboat movies,  they rank right up there with Shaun the sheep, Jakers, Thomas.  Honest, simple lessons that we all need to remember. Still blows my mind that Denny Doherty once belonged to the Mamas and Papas. pb",1285545600,,234,4.682926829268292
7789580,1,0780623290,"I purchased this video for my child and found it absolutely awful.  At least in Thomas the tank engine you get a little bit of a better story, for example, Theadore and his friends are too friendly to each other.  At least  in Thomas they at least the Frieght Cars torment the engines a bit.  I  recommend you do not buy this video.",956966400,2,332,4.2063492063492065
