8250474,5,B0013ENL5S,"We really enjoy this 9 film compilation of old-time classic comedy hits.  It includes Burns & Allen, Jack Benny, Lucy, Red Skelton, and my favorite, The Three Stooges.  We were able to view all the episodes several times on our DVD player and each has high quality sound and video.  Highly recommended, especially for this low priced set!",1399939200,,338,4.793103448275862
8250475,2,B0013ENL5S,"DIGIVIEW's slimline cased DVDs feature unrestored public domain films that have no subtitles or extras. Audio levels are some of the highest you'll find, which makes these ideal for laptop PC or portable disc player watching.

The nearly-five hours of programming on their CLASSIC COMEDY volume is a sampler of public domain TV sitcoms and variety shows, plus a COLUMBIA studio comic two-reeler.

Included below are my 1 to 10 ratings applicable solely to each selection's video condition.

PROGRAM--
[6] THE LUCY SHOW - ""Lucy Gets Trapped"" (a bit blurry, colors show age shift)
[5] THE RED SKELTON SHOW - United Nations special (b&w image shakes up and down)
[7] THE THREE STOOGES - ""Malice in the Palace"" (well-preserved Shemp film has good contrast)
[5] THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE & HARRIET - ""Losing Miss Edwards"" (blurry pic; audio overmodulation)
[6] THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES - ""Granny's Spring Tonic"" (overdubbed banjo intro has better sound than the show)
[6] THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW - ""A Wife for Andy"" (jazzy music replaces whistling theme at start)
[7] THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW - ""Give Me Your Walls"" (dark intro, but rest is fine; has great sound)
[5] The GEORGE BURNS & GRACIE ALLEN SHOW - ""Gracie Gives George a Party"" (sounds a bit murky; average picture quality)
[?] THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM - Jack dreams he's married to Mary (not sure)

I was unable to get the last show to play. In fact, all of this disc's second layer malfunctioned. Major points off for manufacturing flaw.
