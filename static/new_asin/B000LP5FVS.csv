There in business to make a buck, but they keep getting involved with a gang of magic users hat are trying to take over the world. The Apostles of the Star is a gang led by one of Train's old syndicate colleagues who has a creepy infatuation with him.

This anime has plenty of action and comic relief. The animation is great and so is the soundtrack. Both English and Japanese voice tracks are pretty good. I think this anime had a little too much filler in it, but not enough to hurt the series. All of the characters are cool and very likable. The story is also kind of unique.

I had a good time watching this anime and for the price you can't go wrong.",1354579200,,729,4.2
