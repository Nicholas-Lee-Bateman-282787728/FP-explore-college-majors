They do their best; they act honorably and bravely; but you get a sense they're just moving around in cirlces and not accomplishing very much to make a real victory come about.  It's also very telling how much the soldiers change.  They become harsh, jaded, less patient with Iraqis, and less enthralled with the various patriotic cliches they and their families uttered before their departure.  From what we can tell, most do not reenlist and view war and the army very differently from the way they did before they left.

The movie does a very good job of showing the interaction of war and the homefront. Frankly,  the homefront appears to really demotivate some of the soldiers, some of whose wives fall apart in their absence.  In other cases, these country women and families  show real strength in the absence of their husbands and loved ones.

This is the real thing. The real Army and the real Iraq.  It's not a bunch of spit and polish parades, but real troops, none of whom embarrass the military, but it's not exactly the 5th Special Forces Group either.  They're average.  And they're from the kind of economically depressed and average communities that so often send their best into the military.",1158364800,19,1541,4.9765625

8138084,5,B000HC2LTY,"In a farm town in Arkansas, you have a motley group of young and old sign up for the National Guard. They expect to train one weekend a month, do a full two week service once a year, get called up if there's a flood or a tornado. Big deal, it's patriotic, it's fun, they earn some spare cash. But in a war, the president can ""annex"" the National Guard into the regular army and send you off to fight, which is what happens.
These guys have no objection, they're patriots who consider it an honor to fight for democracy. But what what with? Their trucks are from the Vietnam era, and so are the guns. They're all out of shape, they have no idea how to properly address an officer, and the marksmanship is weak. Motivation is all they have, and even that's not enough. When they get to Iraq, their training and equipment are all inadequate.
I remember how this was back in 2004. Small towns all over the USA saw their young men (and some women) get sent off to fight, and thanks to lousy training/gear, a lot of them never returned. Those that did return, I wonder how they turned out. They came from a peaceful, easygoing town, so the shock of being away from home must have been heavy on them.",1412035200,,1193,4.283185840707965
8138085,2,B000HC2LTY,"This series had promise, and I was looking forward to it. But for me, it fell short. Here are some of my observations after watching the first 2 DVDs in the series:

Complaining. And more complaining. Whining. And more whining. Drama. Sometimes lots of drama. That's not my idea of the regular military or National Guard, but that's what this series portrays. Why not just do your duty without the groaning, moaning, and griping?

What is the main reason why people join the National Guard? Is it just to make an extra buck? Sounds like it to me.

One guardsman held up a handmade sign that said ""what happened to 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks a year?"" When you join the National Guard, don't you know that you could be called to active duty? Didn't these guys know that?

""Ask not what you can do for your country. Ask what your country can do for you!"" That's the impression I got from most of the guardsmen in the series.

Why are people allowed to be in the National Guard if they are not deploy-able? It doesn't make sense.

If your marriage is rocky, then a deployment won't help it. More drama.

Some of the guardsmen didn't have their facts straight:
Iraq didn't attack or invade the USA.
Iraq didn't cause 9/11.

Some of the guardsmen likened their Iraq situation to the Vietnam War. None of those guardsmen were in Vietnam. Those 2 wars were very different.

The religious people and their church drama were awful. It reminded me of the religious people and synagogues that Christ encountered when He walked the planet. They were showy, glitzy, trivial, carnal, fake, ungodly; they did things to impress the people around them.

For any given episode (there are 3 episodes per DVD), roughly half of an episode is about the guardsmen in Iraq, and the other half of the episode is about the life of their loved ones back home.

After watching the first 2 DVDs, I didn't care enough about the series to watch the last 2 DVDs.

This program shows a small cross-section of society. Folks in the National Guard come from all walks of life, but you wouldn't know that from this program. I think this program does the National Guard a disservice, which is a shame.

8138087,4,B000HC2LTY,"This documentary was a good watch although at points I feel it could of been better (I feel it dragged on unnecessarily at points). It follows a company of Engineers from Arkansas from the National Guard and their 18 month deployment. You really get a feel for the characters and connect with them as well. The Irelan story really stuck with me, and I hope the young gentleman and his father are doing well. All in all I'd say give it a watch and see for yourself.

PS: The part that made the most mad, was Betts and his cowardice.",1365638400,,531,4.31
8138088,3,B000HC2LTY,only three episodes instead of ten... should have wrote that... idk still a good show i will purchase the rest from someone else,1361750400,,128,4.608695652173913
8138089,5,B000HC2LTY,"The reviewer who was unhappy that no happy times were shown most likely never served. I spent a year in a different war zone with a different kind of soldier (draftees). While our experience was different, I thought this film captured the tedium and fright of the real thing. Military recruiters won't like this film but high schoolers contemplating enlistment would do well to watch this.  And PS: very few citizen soldiers (as opposed to happy killers) find war much fun. Being in combat may have its moments of exhileration - survival or winning a fire fight - but it is not a happy experience.",1217203200,5,597,4.685714285714286
8138090,5,B000HC2LTY,"I have greatly appreciated these DVDs. It has been very interesting, and surely moving (as far as I'm concerned) to take an inside look at the lives of these soldiers from Arkansas. The war in Iraq is not well understood here in Italy and it is hard to find such documents, excerpts from real life. I wish the Italian media would buy and write about what America really is and fights for.

8138092,2,B000HC2LTY,"This documentary is about National Guard Soldiers that are activated and sent to Iraq. Though some of this is interesting, it is mostly filled with boring elongated scenes. It should have been cut down from 10 hours to maybe 2 hours. It also shows little about how the Soldiers live in Iraq. Some people who are not experienced may believe that this is what the war in Iraq is like, however, it is not true to reality. It only shows a few people's points of view. The Soldiers in this unit are from Arkansas and although very nice, the filmakers make a point of showing just how redneck they are. These people are only some of the Soldiers of the U.S military. There are lots of highly educated people and it is very diverse but you will not see that in this film. The only thing you will see over and over again until it annoys you is how unhappy a few Soldiers are. Of course it is never pleasant to be deployed to another country, but these guys make Soldiers look bad. Its one thing to complain but over their entire time in Iraq, wasn't there any fun or good times between the men? Well, this documentary doesn't show it. It is definetly not worth the money I paid for it. From my first hand experience, I have never witnessed a unit present themselves in such a negative way. I am surprised they would even participate in this and can only wonder if they were happy with the final product because it made them look bad.",1162166400,13,1425,4.340823970037453
