8375121,4,B002NLK1VW,"We rented this from our library, and we'll probably end up purchasing our own copy.  The music is fun (performed well) and, although it's not the most professional production, my 3yo daughter enjoys the movements and activity.  I enjoy it because it's something we can do together inside that allows my daughter to get some of her energy out and I can get a little workout as well.  We have a pretty small room, but it doesn't really require much space.  The disc says it's about 40 mins long, but the activity portion is more like 25 mins, and there are breaks.  There is a warmup, some jumping and running around, and then it ends with a yoga cool down.  I would definitely recommend this as something to keep around the house for those days when you're cooped up inside and need a little lift.",1422230400,,796,4.455172413793103
8375122,3,B002NLK1VW,I bought this because I teach preschool dance classes and was hoping for some fresh ideas. The video was very short and didn't have a lot to offer. It would be good for a family who was looking for something to do at home--good for a mom or dad who had no experience with kids movement exercises. But for a creative parent or dance educator there is just nothing new in the video and it really has very little to offer. I appreciated the enthusiasm of cast but I was just hoping for more--lots more.,1282521600,2,499,4.2631578947368425
