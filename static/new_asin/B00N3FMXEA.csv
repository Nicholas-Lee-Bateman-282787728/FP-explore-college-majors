6608496,5,B00N3FMXEA,"I know& understand that the "" TRANSFORMERS"" movie is fictional and all,... but I love the fact that TRANSFORMERS was actually brought to life and then turned into a movie. I love the special effects, the various variety of color, & the change of the different robots which's absolutely so cool!! I've always liked watching ""TRANSFORMERS"" because amongst several other shows that I happen to like watching.

6608583,3,B00N3FMXEA,"The slip cover had significant wear, and the two removable disc trays inside were completely broken from the case, disc's are perfect condition tho, only reason i gave 3 stars",1464048000,2,175,4.866666666666666
6608584,4,B00N3FMXEA,"I ordered the NON-Region-Free version, which is the version that costs $30.00 at the time of this review. It arrived promptly and includes five discs: one disc for each of the first three films and two discs for the fourth film (the second of which includes the behind-the-scenes special features, which amount to more than four hours of content). I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't include second discs for the first three movies but includes one only for the fourth movie, which is why I'm giving it ""only"" four stars out of five. Overall, it's a great deal.

EDIT:

Since I first wrote this review, I've noticed that the back of the box says, 'NOT TO BE SOLD SEPARATELY,' which implies that the particular version of the 4-Disc set that I received was taken from some sort of combination box set that perhaps included an action figure or model of some sort. Perhaps this explains why the case looks a bit worn down (though the discs truly look brand new and don't seem to have ever been used). I personally don't have a problem with this, but I'm pretty sure that others may, which is why I'm mentioning it in this amendment of my original review.",1463961600,22,1154,4.570048309178744
