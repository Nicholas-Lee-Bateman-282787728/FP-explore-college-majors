7809713,5,6301061160,"This movie,based on a play by 2 members of MONtY PYTHON feature a cast of 3 oscar winners, and delightful unknowns (at the time) who weave a delightful web of dark comedy.

A quality chocolate plant gets taken over by a conglomerate whose only interest is the bottom line. An accident involving the death of 3 workers provides the ""magic"" special ingredient that make the chemically based psuedo-chocalate substitute tasty. How to keep the deaths a secret, and how to get more bodies, leads you on a merry yet dark trail of laughs. A special delight is the performances of Vanessa Redgave and Freddy Laker.",1399852800,,606,4.771428571428571
7809714,4,6301061160,"This is a dark comedy, and you have to understand the writers to really appreciate it. It was based on a play written by Python's Palin and and Jones and to my knowledge never made it to DVD. You have to put yourself back about 20 years in time to clearly understand it, other than that it was an excellent comedy with all the antics one would expect from the Python writers. Vanessa Redgrave's peformance was hilarious and Jonathan Pryce's business savy kept the momentum up. My hat's off to Palin and Jones for turning a simple accident into a funny romp through black humor.",1256342400,3,577,4.504761904761905
7809715,4,6301061160,"This was a great movie. I first watched it in 1989. At the beginning three men accidentally fell in a vat of chocolate. The man responsible for the men falling in was Ian Littleton.
People liked this candy with humans in it very well. Because the people liked this candy, the candy manufacturers assumed that people would like the candy with pigs and cows in it but they didn't. People wanted to eat chocolates with people in them. Because of this, Littleton was ordered by his bosses to start putting dead people in the chocolate candy and people went crazy for the candy; not knowing there were bits of people in them. This movie was funny.
I read on Wikipedia that this movie is hard to find in the USA but I found it quite easily. I bought it right here at amazon and you should do the same. I give this film a 4 star rating.",1250812800,,829,4.286624203821656
7809716,5,6301061160,"It seems this movie has gotten a lot of negative reviews by the critics, and it has passed into Forgotten-Movie-Oblivion as far as rentals go, or even as far as people's memories have gone.

I saw this movie about 15 years ago, and thought it was pretty darn funny. Not hilarious, but funny. It was bizarre in that brilliant Python-esqe way. It is loaded with British humor the way they do it best. Throw a polite, sensible, English chap into an extremely horrible and embarassing situation, and then watch as he uncomfortably deals with it. Keeping his gentlemanly politeness at all times, of course. ""Shall I kill myself sir? Would that help?""

I liked the humor, liked the fairly gross story, and I especially liked the women in this movie. They really carried the story quite a bit. His girlfriend is very funny to me, especially how she so casually accepts that they have been putting dead bodies into their company's chocolate. ""My experiment worked!"". The landlady is funny also; so is the secretary. The lusty widow woman was okay, but a little bit over the top. I couldn't even understand what she was saying half the time. But that was okay.

I love how the movie ends. ""Chocolate Man of the Year!"" And the last scene is the best, when the guy has totally lost it. He feels his wife's thigh, thinking of how juicy and meaty it is. You can tell that he is a bit off his rocker by that time.

This movie is definitely one of the weirdest and most strange movies I have ever seen. Nevertheless, it is still a gem. If you have ever thought to yourself that chocolate and cannibalism would make a good combination, then this is the movie for you!",1124150400,4,1651,4.511705685618729
7809717,5,6301061160,"The personal tragedy of three workers in a chocolate mixer will origin all a chain of funny events when the Management decides to avoid no matter how the final product be consumed, but a sociological miracle happens. The product is a true success and the risen question is: and now, what will it be the next step?

Exhilarating, and following measure by measure Monthy Phiton's irreverent and caustic satire.",1113868800,,408,4.913043478260869
7809718,5,6301061160,"This is an story about the absurdity of modern world, from marketing to production, in a chocolate factory that started to have problems since they changed traditionnal ingredients to synthetic stuff...until the day an accident happens. The ""boudin""-flavoured chocolate is a hit, and a special department (headed by J. Pryce) is created to ensure the supply of the raw material...

The film is absolutely hilarious!

A shame it does not exist in DVD format.",1099180800,3,457,5.162162162162162
