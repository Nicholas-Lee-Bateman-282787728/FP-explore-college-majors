8650804,4,B00JH7L3RG,"Great DVD!  Although it's filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio and audio is only stereo, the audio and video qualty is very good.
Also video production is fine, no 1-second--shots, but nicely filmed. (take into account that it's a TV performance)
Personally, I like the Guilty Dogs more than the Goners, but since there's not much JH video around you should give this DVD a try.
The song selection is a good mix of old and new  (2003) songs. The band of course is as tight as you may espect. Interesting by the way to see how Slow Turning is played here, very slowly!
Anyway, if you're a fan of John Hiatt, get this DVD!",1409961600,,610,4.342105263157895
