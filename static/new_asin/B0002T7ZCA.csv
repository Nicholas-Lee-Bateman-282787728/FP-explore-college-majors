8031636,1,B0002T7ZCA,"I'm pretty sure this is the 4 pak DVD set I purchased at a local Book Store. Two reasons why I'm not absolutely certain. 1-No picture here on Amazon. 2-I threw the 4 pak set into the garbage because that is where it belongs. I'm sure Allan Menezes is a competent Pilates instructor but he needs to learn how to produce a DVD that is fun. This DVD was not fun. It was flat boring and painful to watch. I wasn't the only person who felt this.  Most of the DVDs (actually I think all of the DVDs) Mr. Menezes lectures to the camera and uses average looking people clad in spandex to demonstrate movement. All theory and technique.  There isn't a single minute that passes without watching one of Allan's floor models in a stationary pose while he points to joints and muscles making comments and lecturing. As a final note. There seems to be a growing trend among publishers to package multiple DVDs in a ""value"" pack. The marketing gurus figure the public will pay more money for garbage. Don't do it. Take your time and research. One well produced fitness DVD for $30 is money better spent than buying the $60 multipak of worthless garbage.  Good luck friends.",1161129600,,1159,4.483412322274882
