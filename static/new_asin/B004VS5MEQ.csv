8443951,5,B004VS5MEQ,"This is a great strength, speed, and power development DVD; it greatly enhances techniques learned in MMA and martial arts training by supplying the necessary horsepower (power and speed). Brian Klaus demonstrates power and strength training exercises found in bodybuilding and powerlifting and shows how to modify and implement these exercises for the MMA game or martial arts training. Tony Cecchine also demonstrates a few of the lifts on this DVD. Combining this program with the proper nutrition and the sky is the limit. Highly reccomended! Great job Bryan!",1318636800,,563,5.337078651685394
8443952,5,B004VS5MEQ,"This is the best DVD out there for turning a home workout into a realistic strength and conditioning routine for cage fighting.

Brian Klaus comes across instantly as knowing what he is talking about.  The technique demonstrations are clear and conducted safely.  Much of MMA training revolves around cardio training, but Brian pushes the envelope with building POWER.  As a former power lifter, he puts together routines that will definitely boost your strength in the cage.

Even if you aren't cage fighting, Klaus's DVD can easily be translated to a hardcore home fitness lifestyle or to other MMA related sports such as Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Wrestling, Kickboxing etc.  If you have a need for power and want to do it in a way that won't sacrifice speed, explosiveness or cardio, this is the DVD for you.

I was even more impressed by his connection to Tony Cecchine and his catch wrestling background as well.  Great DVD by Paladin. (Literally everything I get from Paladin is super professional and helpful)",1317859200,,1017,4.976331360946745
