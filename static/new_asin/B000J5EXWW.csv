8149295,5,B000J5EXWW,"This DVD is like taking a private class with Zahar Zuhair.  She begins by explaining the stylized differences between Egyptian, Lebanese and western belly dance.  She also reviews proper execution of the basic moves she will be using, including the legs and feet which are often overlooked.  As she connects the moves together into seamless combinations, she leaves nothing to chance.  She clearly demonstrates where the change from one move to another occurs as well as addresses hands and arms.  The end result is a series of smooth and silky combinations that can be worked into any performance.  This is a multi level DVD and appeal to even the most advanced dancer.",1338163200,3,670,4.9375
8149296,5,B000J5EXWW,"Zahra is a very good teacher, and she does the movements slowly so one can follow up, although sometimes it was hard to see the move, especially the figure eight when not done by itself, but I'm sure dancers will figure it out.  Very good DVD, I liked it.  Worth my money.",1188259200,2,272,4.211538461538462
