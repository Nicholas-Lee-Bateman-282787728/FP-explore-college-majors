6492914,5,B00LN878LC,"One of Cooper's better ""westerns"".  First saw Distant Drums around 1956.  Olive Films did another outstanding remastering job on this Blu-Ray copy. Filmed on location in Florida.  Blu-Ray print is very sharp and colorful.  Must have for western or Gary Cooper collectors.  Buy. Olive Films has done a great remastering some many old movies and hopefully will do many more.  Couple of suggestions would be She Wore A Yellow Ribbon with John Wayne and The Big Sky with Kirk Douglas.",1412640000,2,480,4.9375
6492915,5,B00LN878LC,"One of my favorite films of the fifties with Gary Cooper as the stalwart hero.  This is Raoul Walsh's remake of an earlier film of his ""Objective Burma"" starring Errol Flynn.  Both films are excellent.  Thanks to Olive for releasing this hard to find title on blue ray.  The quality on this is very good.  Filmed in the Everglades the photography is excellent.  If you have never seen this film you are in for a treat.",1411430400,2,418,4.434210526315789
6492916,5,B00LN878LC,"Such a delightful piece of Warner Brothers escapist entertainment, shot mostly on location at Silver Springs, Florida and St. Augustine's historic Castillo de San Marcos National Monument. This film's place in history comes mainly from featuring the famous Sheb ""Purple People Eater"" Wooley as the hapless Private Jessup who, upon being attacked by an alligator, utters the first instance of the ""Wilhelm scream"" on film.",1411344000,4,421,5.492307692307692
6492917,4,B00LN878LC,"Solid adventure tale set in the swamps of Florida, good cast and nice color with plenty of action and suspense and Cooper as the main stud. No one pointed this out but the storyline was peeled almost directly from the Errol Flynn 1945 vehicle 'Objective Burma' which is another pretty decent action flick with loads of stars. Worth watching as it puts a nice dent in a Saturday afternoon.",1407628800,,388,4.63768115942029

8666774,5,B00LN878LC,Gary Cooper stars in one of his best movies Distant Drums its a wonderful movie about the Ocala Seminoles of the Florida Everglades.filmed in the Florida everglades the Blu-ray is excellent.,1507680000,,190,5.161290322580645
8666775,5,B00LN878LC,"Very good movie,saw it when it first came out and have it on DVD,I had too get it on Blu-ray Great movie!!!",1484784000,,107,3.909090909090909
8666776,5,B00LN878LC,"Because Distant Drums has the historical inaccuracy of having repeating firearms in 1840, several IMDB critics have panned it. I prefer to be impressed by what the movie does have going for it, and here are some selling points:

1.  Outstanding color photography of the Florida Everglades and a closeup tour of the area's beauties and dangers.
2.  Arthur Hunnicutt. It's impossible to detect that this great character actor is only giving a performance--he's totally believable as a frontiersman.
3.  The Seminoles are a formidable foe, and I mean formidable.  They shoot accurately and they are relentless.  Their costumes are also most
  convincing. They are frightening.
4.  Gary Cooper's character is quiet, dry-witted, modest--all the qualities we consider the man himself to be.
5.  Max Steiner's score is one of his finest, and that's saying something.  The score is colorful and filled with suspense.  It captures a sense of the
  environment with a keen appreciation of the aforementioned beauties and dangers.

It is my opinion that Distant Drums would have been stronger without the Cooper/Mari Aldon romance, but I like the picture so much that, on the whole, I'm willing to overlook it.

This Blu-Ray has fantastic picture quality and very satisfying sound.  Fans of Objective, Burma!, Northwest Passage, or Merrill's Marauders should not hesitate to check out Distant Drums.",1475625600,6,1388,5.236363636363636
8666777,5,B00LN878LC,Gary Cooper western that delivers. I think it is one of his better westerns and he made some great ones. Well worth the watch.,1473206400,,126,4.291666666666667
8666778,4,B00LN878LC,So good that it was released on Blu-ray. Gary Cooper one of my all time favorites.,1460419200,,82,4.1875
8666779,5,B00LN878LC,"I have always like this movie and this Blu-ray is replacing a VHS tape.  The picture quality is excellent for an old movie.
The scenes in the Florida Everglades are crisp and clean.  Not an award winning movie, but if you like Coop you will enjoy this movie.",1435276800,,258,4.354166666666667
8666780,5,B00LN878LC,"I love this film and don't know how many times I've seen it since my childhood. Although I have several versions of this DVD, the quality has been disappointingly poor so far. This blu ray disc is amazingly restored and the color is more beautiful than I expected. Gary Cooper seems a bit old and gray, but still powerful and strong enough to fight in the water. If you are a fan of Cooper and this film, the disc is worthwhile as keeper.",1428019200,3,438,4.289156626506024
8666781,3,B00LN878LC,"This is not one of Cooper's better movies but it is entertaining and, for this fan, any Gary Cooper film is worth seeing.  The hi-def of blu-ray really shines.  But it's released by Olive Films.  So, once again, no pity for the hard of hearing people.  It's just another time where Olive has taken a film that had been released on DVD with sub-titles but they've refused to put them on the blu-ray.",1417910400,7,398,4.410958904109589
