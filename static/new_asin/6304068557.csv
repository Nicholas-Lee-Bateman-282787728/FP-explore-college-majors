770805,5,6304068557,"Watched this over and over as a kid. And growing up watching re-runs of ""Laverne and Shirley"", and her made for TV movie ""Save the Dog,"" I was quite used to Cindy Williams, who plays Chuckies mom in this film. Amazon actually recommended this movie for me due to a purchase of the same kind, and I was so happy to add it to my dvd collection. It's terribly korny, but if you grew up with it, you'll still like it. Not to mention, there really are a lot of familiar faces in the film.",1372118400,,483,4.094736842105263

770808,3,6304068557,"My son is 3 and watching this with him is the only reason I would see this. The only other possible reason is being a Broncos fan and seeing all that classic Broncos merchandise with their best emblem. Brought back some good memories of old Mile High Stadium. You really appreciate Denver's old uniforms with this movie. After all, the Broncos have had the worst uniforms in any sport since 1997. It's a decent family movie. Most of all for kids. After all, that's their target audience, kids from 3-12 years of age.",1328313600,,516,4.559139784946237
770883,4,6304068557,"B I N G O is a cute family movie, you can watch it with kids, and I (a kid at heart) liked the movie as well.",1328227200,,109,3.074074074074074
770884,4,6304068557,"I liked the movie and thought it was hilarious. It had a lot of original gags in it. Although I agree with some of the reviewers about the profanity in the movie I would like to point out that it is no more than many other so-called kids' movies these days---which says a lot about the state of society today. If you were to remove the profanity, I think that most reviewers would give this a five star rating, it was that funny.",1296777600,,429,4.180722891566265
770885,4,6304068557,"I've seen this family film many times when I was a kid. Now, it has become a reminder of my childhood. Unfortunately, it isn't as great as the other films that I've watched when I was a kid (like The Land Before Time & Flight of the Navigator). It's very average for an animal flick. But it still has likeable characters, a well-written script, and some nice humor. ""Bingo"" can still enjoyable for families from all acround the country, but you are warned. There are indeed some fairly dark and intense scenes in some parts, so the little kids might be a bit frightened.

Grade: B",1246320000,,580,4.471698113207547
770886,1,6304068557,"Don't bother! The young boy says ""Holy S***"" and the dad says ""d***"" within the first 20 minutes alone! Besides the language, the concept of centerfolds and scantily clad circus performers appear for no reason at all. The parents of this boy are horrendous. There were no redeeming qualities to this movie. I recycled ours (couldn't even bring myself to subject anyone at Goodwill to own it!). If you think I'm just being overprotective, then skip it simply for the extremely bad acting. No matter how you look at it, it is bad Bingo!",1242172800,7,534,4.691489361702128
770887,1,6304068557,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie is nothing -- and I mean nothing -- you'd want your kids to watch, no matter how old they are.

Kids and adults in this movie swear, flip the bird and insult each other. The entire ""joke"" of a family that would wait out a night before looking for their lost child gave my son nightmares, and he's 10 years old. The flashback to a fire that killed the dog's mother frightened him and the dark plot that centers around an eatery that turns dogs into dogmeat utterly horrified both of us. We turned the movie off after 15 minutes and threw it away. I wouldn't regift this DVD to my worst enemy.",1235347200,6,636,4.213114754098361
770888,3,6304068557,"I would have preferred the language remain G in this film.  I believe young children learn enough bad language out of the home, that it didn't need to be included in this movie.",1222041600,4,177,4.363636363636363
770889,1,6304068557,"This movie will only be appreciated by the youngest of crowds...so WHY ALL THE BAD LANGUAGE?  It's touted as a ""Family"" film..what family would want to sit around watching little kids cuss and give each other the finger?

Maybe it's for an older audience?  Ummm...no.  The dog drives a car, has a one night stand, testifies in court, gets a nasal membrane transplant (b/c his smeller has worked too hard), administers CPR...Need I go on?  Oh...and he spends much of the movie tracking down his human friend who has left him a URINE trail to follow.  No wonder his smeller needs to be replaced.",1218585600,6,593,4.653846153846154
770890,4,6304068557,"I don't care what people might say, but I love this film. I saw it many years ago on VHS. So for me it's nostalgia to see it again on DVD in better quality... There must be something special about films, which you have seen, been a child.",1211500800,,238,3.9791666666666665
770891,4,6304068557,"A fun family film adapted from the children's song ""Bingo"" a dog that was owned by a man. Bingo's life starts out harsh in a circus but he gets a good home in the end. Young children will enjoy the silly humor.",1193011200,,210,4.023809523809524
770892,3,6304068557,"If I had to categorize Bingo, it is definitely intended more as a pet comedy than as a pet adventure.  In fact, some of the comedy is to the point of absurdity when people treat Bingo as a human.  Regarding the focus, the film bounces back and forth between being exclusively about the dog or about the boy & his family.

Pretty standard plot devices: 1) Remarkable dog who is unwanted & unappreciated by adults.  2) An oddball family with a mean older brother, over-protective mother, and a preoccupied father who wants to toughen up his youngest son.  3) Typical inept villains - a stupid, mean one who thinks he's not stupid and an even stupider, dopey one who doesn't know any better.  4) The dog saves the day and eventually endears himself to everyone.

I bought this as a family film to watch with my 4yo son, but it is rated PG for good reason.  Bingo is really not for younger children.  Lots of unnecessary language - GD, s**t, da**it, smarta**, hell, and a couple lesser phrases that you may not want your young ones incorporating into their daily vocabulary - some shut-ups, stupids, jerks, nuts, and dumbs.  What stuck out is that this was a family movie and the language seemed completely unnecessary.  It sure didn't add anything.

A few disturbing scenes for young viewers - hot dogs made out of real dog, a couple scenes of children looking at adult magazines, a scene of a vehicle crashing into a storefront with people in a cage in back, a prostitute in a hotel room, a kidnapped family all tied up, heavy gunfire, knife fight, and so on.

Lots of uncouth humor - pee and poo gags, dog gender jokes, and the like.  Funny to older children, but maybe not appropriate for younger ones.

Some good gags - traffic cop giving the dog a sobriety test, the dog driving a car, a court reporter reading back the dog's testimony, and evading search lights in a prison yard.

All in all, it's not a bad film, just not worth any special praise either.  It's mediocre.

If you don't already own them, there are plenty of better dog adventures - Milo & Otis, Homeward Bound, Napoleon, Eight Below; as well as better dog comedies - live-action 101 Dalmatians, Babe, Air Bud, Beethoven, and so on.

Aspect ratio is standard, full-frame 1.33:1.",1163289600,13,2246,4.57
771031,4,6304068557,"I purchased ""Bingo"" and ""My Dog Skip"" at the same time. Both movies seemed sort of episodic, but both were fairly entertaining. I wound up liking ""Bingo"" a lot more though since it was funny. Some of the comedy was a little outlandish (sort of like something you'd expect from movies like ""Naked Gun,"" ""Airplane,"" or ""Scary Movie.""), but some of the gags were downright hillarious. At times this movie seemed to be a movie about a boy and his dog and at other times it was more like the dog was the main focus. Since comedy was actually the main focus of this movie, this is forgiveable, but the movie seemed somewhat incoherent at times. While ""My Dog Skip"" erred on the side of the corny and sentimental, ""Bingo"" was filled with lots of strong comedy (and a few lame jokes too). So, if you want to have fun and see a movie about a boy and a dog, see ""Bingo"" and skip the other movie!",1147564800,2,885,4.3053892215568865

771033,5,6304068557,"I used to watch this movie all the time. Not so much because it's one of the greatest dog-centric films ever made, but just because of its pleasing nature. It's cute, it's funny, and charming, and entertaining. It doesn't go overboard in any of those areas, but has just enough of each to make it a nice movie to watch. Somewhat geared toward adults language-wise? Perhaps, yes. But there's nice acting from dogs and people alike and some memorable scenes (and, yes, some violent ones). But naturally, Bingo always comes through and saves the day. This is a fun family film.",1084060800,9,574,4.693069306930693

The plot of an intelligent 'human' like canine is a recurring theme in fiction, but Bingo takes it to another 'level'. It stars Cindy Williams (Laverne and Shirley) and David Rasche (Sledge Hammer!) and they are ALWAYS brilliant.
Forget 'Lassie' or 'Rin Tin Tin' because Bingo leaves them for the comparable mutts they are. No 'spoiler alerts' here; just the advocacy to BUY this film IMMEDIATELY and really 'enjoy' a viewing 'pleasure'.",1486080000,,566,4.968421052631579

Like other commentators said, it is a rather predictable and outlandish kid's movie - don't watch this if you're expecting something much greater - but it is NOT worthy of the horrible reviews it got when it was first released in theaters. Further, this movie has some very racy moments and language for a kid's movie so that kept my interest going, along with the fact that Bingo the dog is so darn cute! All in all, I'd say it is a rather forgettable movie, but that alone does not merit how ""awful"" some other people have (mistakenly, imo) claimed it to be.",1462579200,,692,4.372093023255814
