8474088,3,B005I0DUUY,"Overlooking the obvious point that this is a great bargain, this is a strange mix of selections:

""Christmas in Wonderland"" with Patrick Swayze (yeah, he actually still had roles as late as 2007) is a schizophrenic mess so full of product placements that it's little more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for a mall in Canada. It's barely watchable in places. If you have dumb kids at home they might like it.

""How the Toys Saved Christmas"" is a well-animated feature, but it's an Italian import simply reworked a little for American audiences and a LOT is lost in translation. While Santa Claus is referenced he's never seen (because, one would have to assume, he wasn't actually in the original script), and instead we get some ""good witch"" who has something to do with Christmas in Italy. Your dumb kids at home probably won't like it.

""The Man Who Saved Christmas"" is a biopic about toymaker A.C. Gilbert and, while pretty clearly not historically-accurate, is still a very entertaining movie starring Jason Alexander who does well in this role. The holiday season is mentioned prominently throughout and this is perhaps the best of this collection.

""A Hobo's Christmas"" also is a strong inclusion and concerns the return of an elderly grandfather to the family for Christmas after years of a hobo lifestyle. Lots of adultish themes here and strife between the grandfather and his son, a police officer portrayed by Gerald McRaney. Well-acted by the whole cast.

""The Littlest Light on the Christmas Tree"" is sort of surprisingly good despite the incredibly-clunky computer animation (which looks more like something concocted on a desktop PC despite being produced in 2005, literally years after upscale computer animation had been a staple in American entertainment). This is the shortest included feature at around 45 minutes long. The music is mostly pretty bad too, but I found it to be creative even though the story doesn't really go anywhere.

""In Search of Santa"" is the throwaway of this collection, and I don't really ""get"" it. Had trouble getting through the whole thing and despite the over-arching Christmas theme, it sure doesn't feel very Christmasy. From 2004, the computer animation is absolutely terrible.",1387584000,2,2238,5.084468664850136
