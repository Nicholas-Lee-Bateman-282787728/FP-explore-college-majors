2470480,3,B000CR7U68,I like the Sierra Nevada Cabin fireplace dvd much better.  This is all letterbox framing so part of your tv screen is black.  Way too much hearth shots - they should add a direct shot of the interior of the fireplace without a hearth shot.  The choice of hearths doesn't do a good roaring fire justice.,1227139200,,302,4.357142857142857
2470481,4,B000CR7U68,"I used this video with a DVD player connected to a projector and we got a great picture on the big screen. I was afraid it might just look like a huge bonfire but it really didn't. It was nice.

I also tried it out on our 27 inch (I know, small) and it was nice there too.

The only thing I didn't like was the freeze it would do when it was repeating. It would freeze temporarily but the length of time it took to repeat could have been due to the DVD player itself. It wasn't that bad though. The fire would just freeze in place and then begin again after a few seconds.",1198108800,,572,3.9224137931034484
2470482,2,B000CR7U68,"1)Each fireplace is around 8-10 minutes, too short.

2)Not that high definition.

3)8 fireplaces, but only 2 look good.

4)Was let down in a nutshell.

5)I prefered the OUTPOSTFX (Plasma DV) fireplace, the fireplace takes around 40 minutes to wear out and it looks much better.",1168300800,9,277,4.956521739130435
2470483,3,B000CR7U68,"The fireplace scenes on this DVD include a Red Brick, Stone, Modern, Dark Marble, Light Marble, Christmas (also has presents and candles) or Psychedelic Fireplace.

You can select music only, crackling log sounds or just the fireplace scenes. They can either rotate endlessly or you can view one at a time with music, which seems to be the most relaxing experience.

Audio options for the music: Smooth Jazz, Ambient, World Beat, Orchestral Piano, Acoustic Guitar and Christmas Music.

The Christmas fireplace with the Christmas music or Orchestral Piano seems the most relaxing so far. The stone fireplace seems to work with the World Beat music, although the music seems to be a little more fiesty than the fireplace.

You might enjoy listening to the ""Candlelight Guitarist CD,"" while playing the fireplace with no sound. With the option for no sound at all, you can have a fireplace and your own music as an additional option.

2470484,5,B000CR7U68,"Oh my god, this DVD is totally cool and easily the best fireplace DVD ever made.  You have to get it! I use it all the time when my boyfriend is over! It definitely lights up the fire in both of us. I would also suggest the Butterflies DVD. I'm a big fan of butterflies and it's a great product to decorate your room with.",1145836800,5,322,3.953846153846154
2470485,5,B000CR7U68,"I first saw this product at a funeral home and it was being used to give a comfortable feeling to those of us that were greif stricken.  I asked the director for the name of the video, and he provided it to me.  I ordered two of these upon my return home, one for myself and one for another family member as a gift.",1392076800,,315,3.90625
2470486,5,B000CR7U68,We hosted a Christmas Party with this playing on our large HD TV. As we have no actual fireplace it created the ambiance that a fireplace without the heat achieved. The price was too hard to pass up. Stephen Spivak did a great job in producing this great screensaver & really helped make our party a great event with folks asking where they could buy it. A Great Job Stephen.,1387238400,,375,4.371428571428571
2470487,5,B000CR7U68,"Now this is fun!  It adds nicely to the atmosphere of the room.  I miss the fireplace I had at my old house so this is great especially since I don't have my TV elevated up over other furniture.  I'll select a different ""scene"" each time I put it on.",1384905600,3,250,3.96
2470488,4,B000CR7U68,"I like the video, it has several different kinds of fireplaces, and a Holiday scene. You can play it with music or you can listening to the crackling sounds of real fire. My daughter had some friends that stopped by, and they thought it was real! :) It somehow makes the room warmer on a cold day :)",1355788800,,299,4.172413793103448
2470489,5,B000CR7U68,"I miss not having a fireplace and this dvd turns my 50"" television into one.  Love the 19 different fireplace and music choices!  Would recommend this highly!",1324512000,,158,4.814814814814815
2470490,5,B000CR7U68,I bought one of these videos for my wife. My daughter saw it during Thanksgiving and insisted that Santa bring her one for Christmas.,1264032000,,133,4.583333333333333
2470491,5,B000CR7U68,I love this fireplace!  I don't have a real one so this is nice to have on in the background while you have a nice conversation with your friends.,1262822400,,146,4.0344827586206895

2470493,3,B000CR7U68,"just a small note to potential customers.  the company mentions ""just another use for your HDTV""  FYI buyer beware, these are in DVD format and DVD's have resolution of max 480p, so if you have an HDTV you will not be watching it in true HD, reguardless if it was ""filmed in HD"" or not.  even if your DVD/BR player or receiver up converts the picture to 720/1080i/1080p it will still not look as good as it would if it was available on BlueRay.  I am not bashing the product, just mearly trying to make a customer aware of what they are truely getting.  enjoy, and thanks for reading.",1253232000,10,584,4.321100917431193
2470494,5,B000CR7U68,Love this video.  The crackling fire sounds make you want to rush over and close the screen.  The realistic images make you want to rush over and rub your hands together in front of it.  We live in a small co-op in Rossmoor (Walnut Creek) California.  Now and then we just NEED a fireplace!,1229385600,2,290,4.314814814814815

8101055,1,B000CR7U68,"Great visual, but DVD options didn't work for the choices of only music, only crackling, silence.  It was stuck on a constant guitar strumming which was monotonous and irritation.  Images, however were well done.
I asked for a replacement as this DVD was defective",1419552000,,264,4.9772727272727275

8101058,4,B000CR7U68,"This is an awesome DVD. With 8 different fireplace scenes and 6 different music selections (smooth jazz, ambient, world beat, orchestral piano, acoustic guitar and christmas), you simply can't go wrong considering the price point of this! I love the ambient sounds of all the music selections and love that it is not just all Christmas songs. You can select a specific fireplace scene or play all on a continuous scene loop - the scenes and music selection are independent of each other. I have deducted a star for this DVD as it does not loop all the music selections. Basically, there is no play all for music. If you select 'acoustic guitar' and 'play all' as your selection, the scenes will loop and change, however, it will only be the acoustic guitar looping and I would have to go back to the menu to change the music selection.

I bought another DVD with only 3 different fireplace scenes and only had christmas songs (and not the instrumental relaxing kind, but regular christmas songs with vocals) and i was very disappointed with that one in comparison to this one! All in all, I would recommend it.",1418515200,,1110,4.663265306122449
