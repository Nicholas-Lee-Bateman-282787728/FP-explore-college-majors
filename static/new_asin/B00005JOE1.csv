1533953,5,B00005JOE1,"This show was one of my favorites growing up. It is one of the reasons I became a photojournalist.  Animal is my hero.  I have the first two VHS tapes but would love the whole series on DVD.  I agree with others about some of the other lesser shows already on DVD.  This show was a classic and needs to be released.  Come on, The White Shadow has a DVD.

Thanks

1533955,5,B00005JOE1,"It's hard to believe that with some of the shows I see on DVD, this one still has not been made available.  This was one of the best, and perhaps most underrated, shows in the history of the medium.  The entire cast was brilliant - including Ed Asner, Mason (voice-over king) Adams, Robert Walden, Linda Kelsey, and Nancy Marchand, among others.  I concur that without the success of this show, the later MTM greats would not have been possible.  I anxiously await that e-mail to tell me that I can renew my subscription to the ""L-A Trib"".",1124582400,25,539,4.525773195876289
1533956,5,B00005JOE1,"I sure hope Fox really plans on putting this one out.  If not, then this page here is a total insult.  Nothing less than complete season sets will do where this series is concerned. It was one of the BEST dramas on TV back in the late 70s and early 80s, and it was a crime that CBS cancelled it just because they didn't like Edward Asner's personal politics.  I guess the price for freedom of speech is the unnecessary death of a decent show.  FACISTS!!",1123113600,28,453,4.232558139534884
1533957,5,B00005JOE1,"Before ""Hill Street Blues"" and ""St. Elsewhere"" was the newspaper drama ""Lou Grant,"" an Emmy award-winning show that was one of the most intelligent on television. The writing was consistently high, as was the acting. The whole cast from Ed Asner on down was terrific. (Fans of ""The Sopranos"" might enjoy seeing Nancy Marchand, who played Tony's mother, as newspaper owner Mrs. Pynchon.)

The show tackled tough subjects, like privacy issues, child abuse, survivalists (in an episode starring Ed Harris). It ran from 1977 to 1982, and without it, later quality MTM dramas like 'Hill Street' and ""St. Elsewhere"" wouldn't have happened. Sadly, only three videos were released of the series; with so many bad TV series getting the DVD treatment, let's hope this gets the release it deserves.",1118707200,42,787,5.10077519379845

Thank goodness we have all the MTM years on DVD. Now...what about finally releasing Lou Grant 1977 to 1982 on DVD??? At least give us the first season! Ed Asner is one of my favorite actors of all time and as his signature character, Lou Grant, he was dynamite. We don't get great acting like this anymore nor do we get great TV dramas like Lou Grant anymore - so can we please have it on DVD? I'll be the first in line to buy it!

1534066,5,B00005JOE1,"Lou Grant was one of the best American drama series ever made. I used to watch the late night re-runs here in the UK on Channel 4 and loved the way it dealt with important social issues, whilst being poignant and entertaining in equal measure. As soon as this is released on DVD, I'll be first in line for a copy. Please release season boxsets now!",1229212800,7,348,4.287878787878788
1534067,5,B00005JOE1,"I love this show. I keep hoping it will be put out on DVD. Its a refreshing look at what real TV should be. Its well acted, well written and engaging. Even 30 years later, many if not most of the shows topics are still as relevant now as they were then. Great show but I don't want to buy it only on amazon's unibox thing. I want DVD copies I can play at my parent's house on a DVD player as easily as I can on  my own DVD player.",1214956800,7,430,3.7252747252747254
1534068,5,B00005JOE1,"The writer's strike is still going on as I write this so I won't download any of these $1.99 episodes because of that, but this was a wonderful show, great characters, terrific writing by writers who get no residuals from these downloads. Too bad the show is one of the few remaining TV shows still not out on DVD. I'd buy the yet-to-be-released DVDs if the WGA gets what it wants -- fair payment for hard work.",1195689600,4,411,4.35064935064935
1534069,5,B00005JOE1,"I totally agree with all these people. 30 years later I still remember this show, and every few months I check amazon to see if it's been released yet. It was an absolute classic; great characters, superb stories, and the thing was, everybody looked REAL. No perfect teeth, Hollywood bone-structures or Hair-To-Die-For. They looked and talked like ordinary working people. And the stories dealt thoughtfully with REAL ISSUES.

It was one of the finest series ever made on either side of the Atlantic, and it's criminal that it is still unreleased on DVD. Wake up Fox!!",1188950400,9,568,4.916666666666667
1534070,5,B00005JOE1,"I  remember when Edward Asner visited in 1984 the provisional news edition office of the catalan channel TV-3, in Barcelona. The late chief editor Albert Viladot asked him if he noted something different in the city since the last time he came. He asked friendly that he saw the change on the signs in the streets, written in catalan.
About the series I especially like the episode Native City, when Lou went to Goshen, the city where he was born, after the death of his aunt. There he discovered an atmosphere of discouragement because of the next close down of the glass factory, and a dark future to its inhabitants. He also rediscovered Carol, an old love of his far youth, a catholic, of polish origin.
I point out the open credits when appear Lou putting a sheet of L.A. Tribune under his bird'cage, and the kitten mewing instead the lion roaring.
I dislike the bullfighting posters in the dinning room.
This series depicts in a successful and entertaining way, the everyday  problems of the north american society of late seventies.",1184371200,7,1039,4.734806629834254
1534071,5,B00005JOE1,"I recently purchased used copies of three of the episode of Lou Grant that were released on VHS. I am amazed that, even though this show was made almost thirty years ago (wow), the subjects are still pertinent to the events happening today. This was a very good show. It really deserves to be rediscovered by today's generation. What's the hold up?",1183420800,11,348,4.629032258064516
1534072,5,B00005JOE1,"Never afraid to tackle controversial subjects, Lou Grant forages ahead of the rest. From Abortion  issues to political graft and intrigue, this series stuck its head out and challenged advocaries to come out their holes and into the Light.",1177200000,4,239,5.128205128205129
7940910,5,B00005JOE1,"They show a lot of really old shows on cable and broadcast networks dedicated to older shows (i.e. MeTV), but I have never seen them show this series. I suppose it's of limited interest. Too bad. Although dramatized, I think this is the best show or movie to depict the actual work of newspaper journalism. I say that as a 30-year newspaper reporter. Asner's acting is top notch.",1399161600,,379,4.588235294117647

7940912,5,B00005JOE1,"Lou Grant was TV done right. I don't have cable and my old dad made sure my sister and I grew up without TV. But we did see the Lou Grant show, because my dad and a few pals of his were avid Bob Dylan bootleg record collectors and Ed Asner's brother Ben owned a record store in KC called Capers Corners. Ben was a funny guy and he had a hip store. My dad loved to go in there whenever he could, because Ben always had interesting things, not to mention rare TMoQ and CBM bootlegs you couldn't find anywhere else.

One of my dad's friends, who was also a Capers Corners Customer, had all the Lou Grants on Betamax and my sister and I loved to go to his house, because he had a TV and let us watch, so we kind of grew up a bit with Lou, both on his show and on the Mary Tyler Moore show. My dad and his pal loved Ben, so by association they loved Ed, even though they didn't know him.

Back then the Lou Grant show must have shocked people, because it was no ordinary sitcom. It dealt with the issues of the day in a way that probably made some in government feel a bit uncomfortable. It was good, hard hitting TV and, like I said in my opening paragraph, it was TV done right.

Ben Asner passed away two decades ago and I still remember how sad my dad was. My old dad passed away two years ago and I'm still sad. And I'm sure I'll be even more sad when they finally release this on DVD, but I'll be first in line to get it and I'll watch The Lou Grant Show with a few tears a slight smile for Ben and my dad.",1377216000,,1507,3.8863636363636362

7940914,5,B00005JOE1,"Why give us ONE season of St Elsewhere, and 3 seasons of Lou Grant. These were two of tv's best. And, come on. Don't start releasing a season or two, and stop.",1351468800,,159,4.0
7940915,5,B00005JOE1,"I remember watching Lou Grant as a teenager. The shows were well written and topical. The show had a big effect on me. I started to like writing and did better in English class at school. I would up as editor of my University newspaper and even wrote for a local paper. I eventually gave up writing for a living because I was not good enough to make it on a daily and went into law. My love of writing and appreciation for what it was like to work on a daily newspaper when daily newspapers were the only way to get the real news has remained.

Sadly Lou Grant has yet to come out on DVD. Until then I have ordered a few of these episodes from Amazon and watched them on my television thanks to a Blu-Ray player that allows me to watch Amazon Instant Video.

The picture quality is fine on an HD television.  These shows were from the late 70's and early 80's and I don' think anything has been done to make them look better on HD televisions. As long as you are not expecting HD quality you will not be disappointed.

Many of the episodes in the series were focused on current topics.  Episodes dealt with topics like censorship, the plight of the homeless, environmental pollution, legal and illegal gambling.  Occasionally there were episodes like this which focused on the newsroom and what it was like to manage a big city newspaper.

As far as i can tell there are only three seasons available on Amazon but the show ran five seasons. I do hope this comes out on DVD or if not if Amazon could get the last two seasons.

There was one episode I remember from 30 years ago (it was from the fifth season and aired on August 30 1982) which dealt with the relocation of some Japanese families in California to internment camps during World War II. It explained what happened historically and built a fictional plot over whether the newspapers owner's late husband took advantage of those forced out of their homes as some businessmen did at that time.  I remember it being a even handed episode which made a big impression on me and still does to this day. I would love to see the episode again.",1347753600,,2096,4.367609254498714
7940916,4,B00005JOE1,"I think I followed ""Lou Grant"" for five of the six years this show was on the air.  Now I am looking for some of the shows.  This item, ""Vol. 1"" (actually the pilot episode on VHS), is something I would keep, since I did not really watch the first episode and it features Rebecca Balding, the female reporter in the pilot who was the first reporter colleague of Robert Walden (Joe Rossi).

However, I am more interested in an episode with Linda Kelsey (Billie Newman) in the cast, since she was in the cast for most of the run and therefore she was the reporter I watched.  I would like at least one episode on VHS or DVD, and apparently I can't find it here on Amazon.  Does anyone have a lead on this?",1346976000,,703,4.177777777777778

7940919,5,B00005JOE1,"Agreeing with everyone here, this IS the best show of the late 70s and early 80s. With the chance to get Mr. Asner on interview and commentaries, along with the remaining cast members, Robert Walden, Linda Kelsey, Jack Bannon, Allen Williams and ""The Animal"", we can only hope that this will become available soon. But don't hold your breath!

Could it be the fact that R. Murdoch owns FOX(which is licensed to put out this and most CBS videos) and who is polar opposite with Mr. Asner in political leanings be the ultimate cause that this wonderful series has not been released on DVD???? Remember the protests over its cancellation during the Iran-Contra debacle??? And the withdrawal of sponsor Kimberly-Clark???? Hmmmmm..... Perhaps it will be released in the next world?
