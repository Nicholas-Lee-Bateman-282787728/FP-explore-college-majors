8036900,5,B00062ICTI,"This is essential for any fan of 'Roxy Music"". This is a concert in France, and it has a great choice of songs. You're at once amazed at their power and energy live, and also at how well they perform even the more sophisticated songs. You will love them even more after watching this, and Bryan is great in his white dinner jacket. They do a cover of John Lennon's 'A Jealous Guy"" that is great! This is a high energy concert with a trio of backup singers dancing in unison just about the entire concert. I love it!",1424908800,,515,4.212121212121212
