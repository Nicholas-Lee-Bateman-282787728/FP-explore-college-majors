5554003,5,B00B2YH7BS,Saw this at Sundance and have already pre-ordered my copy.  I think this is going to be on the best documentaries of the year.

5554009,5,B00B2YH7BS,"Incredible. As a pre existing fan of Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl just became one of my favorite people after watching this film. His attitude towards music and great sound is something that few people values.
I was originally assigned to watch this as a homework assignment, now I'd definitely recommend it to friends. Great documentary and fun to watch.",1506556800,,351,4.966101694915254

5554015,5,B00B2YH7BS,"Thanks to Dave Grohl and everyone who made this movie happen. Much of the music in this movie was the soundtrack of my youth. It's sad that so many of the world's legendary recording studios are no more, but it's great to see Sound City presented here with it's unique and colorful history. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the enthusiasm of those involved who made their mark in music history at Sound City. If you love rock & roll, you really should watch this movie, it's a great trip down memory lane.",1503878400,,508,4.473118279569892
5554016,3,B00B2YH7BS,"Enjoyable content. Dave Grohl holds a deep belief that recorded music performed by people playing together in a room, with as little of modern technology as possible, is superior to recordings made by one or a few people using it. He says the belief,  ""music should sound like people"", many times throughout the film. He interviews like-minded musicians, and none that believe differently. One of the the through-lines of the film is the Neve soundboard used at Sound City, which is now owned by Grohl and kept at his home. In that way, the film is an ode to the most advanced soundboard technology of its time. Grohl and others believe that the technology in the Neve board was responsible for the appealing sound of many of the great records recorded at Sound City. There is no challenge to this belief put forth in the film. Still, I liked the interviews, video and musical performances. The downside was that the sound editing was done poorly. The music was too loud compared to the parts in which people are talking.  I kept having to turn the volume down when music came in, especially during the performances at the end. The difference was that great. I think Dave Grohl did a fine job as a first time director.",1503705600,,1218,4.6342592592592595
5554017,5,B00B2YH7BS,Absolutely epic if you are a true lover of music and its human dimension.  Dave Groehl is a monster and the work he has done here is incredibly important.  How refreshing to see a bonafide rock star who cares more about the art form than about his personal success.  I've got a total man-crush.  Well made Doc that I couldn't stop watching.,1503532800,,340,4.435483870967742

5554021,5,B00B2YH7BS,"My husband and I saw it on TV and knew our son, who is studying music production and recording would love it-we got it as a gift for his birthday.  It was an interesting story.",1500681600,,176,4.0285714285714285
5554022,4,B00B2YH7BS,"Not so much great art as 'about great art'.  And that's good enough.  Just hearing these artists describe various aspects of their music, their careers, is intriguing.  It moves the film.  The ambitions of the film, heart on sleeve and motivations front and center, are noble.  When the film is about halfway over it switches from history to modern/recent attempts at Grohl's analogue resurrection... and it loses its pace.  It's still intriguing and fun to watch, still tells the story behind the music that needs to be told, and tells it well.  But it isn't nuanced, its not a story with a backbeat secondary plot moving towards dramatic conflict and resolution.  So it's 4 stars, not 5.  Because the question isn't 'are these great artists', it's 'is this film great art'?  It's not, it's good art with a worthy agenda.",1500681600,,822,4.807142857142857
5554023,5,B00B2YH7BS,Really enjoyable documentary on the history of Sound City recording studio and the various bands that made some great recordings there.,1499817600,,135,5.476190476190476

5554025,5,B00B2YH7BS,"Why didn't I know about this documentary sooner? This is a real gem of a documentary that I'm thrilled I found as I was browsing to Amazon Prime titles. Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) forms a narrative detailing the history of the legendary Sound City Studios. This documentary covers not only the music that was recorded within the studio, but also music that it has inspired. Any fan of rock music will love this documentary. And if you're anything like me, it will rejuvenate that love.",1499472000,,493,4.744186046511628

5554032,5,B00B2YH7BS,"Very cool. But you forgot to list Rick Springfield as a co-star. He was a big part of this documentary. He was the first musician to sign with Sound City. He's underappreciated, but his popularity is enduring.  Another excellent music documentary is Affair Of The Heart with Springfield. But yeah, it was great, love Nirvana, Foo Fighters, Fleetwood Mac, Neil Young, CC Revival. I'm old enough to remember the 70's musical era with fondness.",1497830400,,441,4.95945945945946

5554035,3,B00B2YH7BS,"Tedious amounts of Dave Grohl and other hard rock musicians jamming when that's not really the focus of the film.  Interview content not so streamlined enough for relevance either.  The moments of several individual people eyes moistening or tearing up over recalling a sentimental subject seemed lingered over in a forced way.  As many others have noted the sound volume switching back and forth from loud playing and soft talking detracts from the flow of watching.

The fantastic bit segment about musician 'feel' spoke volumes in a short space.  Historical perspective about Sound Studio in Van Nuys, the Neve
Console (that Neve guy clip describing his own engineering is so great despite the too overplayed snark from Grohl), and the role of a producer evolving all contributed meaning to the narrative.  I appreciate how musicians would step up to preserve their own rock history equipment in lieu of other usual suspects dropping the ball.",1497139200,,946,5.1103896103896105

It really strikes at the heart of those who are not only familiar with recording practices, but also with the familiarity of SO MANY different groups/musicians who walked through the door. Very interesting discussion also about the change to digital recording.
  The new music that was recorded is nothing other than PHENOMENAL. Highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommended. Don't forget to get the CD of the new tunes too.

I knew Rick Springfield (I was in the music industry too) so I could have sat in on some of his sessions!  Loved the story, it was told very well, and you really got to see some history happening in the music industry back before digital re-arrangement of everyone's voices and instruments (have you ever HEARD Brittney Spears sing really live?

Dave Grohl navigates through the sights, sounds, stars and story of Sound City with heart. His passion for music is clearly evident in the way he weaves the history together with stories from many of the musicians, sound techs, producers and studio employees. All in all it is quite sad to see how it all came to an end. Replaced by technology which in most peoples hands delivers the heartless, soulless music of the moment. Here today and forgotten tomorrow unlike countless memorable as well as influential records (albums) created in the hallowed halls of the dumpy Van Nuys, CA business known as Sound City.",1475193600,,734,4.6976744186046515

5554107,5,B00B2YH7BS,"This is the most emotionally moved I've ever been by a documentary.  Having been born in the early 1960's, I came into my teen years accompanied by pretty much the whole Sound City catalog.  Then, after moving to California in the early 1980's, I lived and worked in Van Nuys and knew every block of the Western San Fernando Valley.  A couple of years later, I got hitched and had a son, who I raised to love all the music I grew up on and as he grew, so did all the great music from Sound City that was a part of our lives every day.  And  where did we live while all this was going on for the next 30 years?  A couple of miles from Sound City.  We used to drive past the Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch) factory and eat chili burgers and the best fries in the world at the Original Tommy's across the street from ""The Bud"", but only if it was a downwind day.  We were oblivious all that time that just around and down the road, history and magic were being made.  God bless Sound City and all the folks there that made it happen and God bless all the wonderful musicians and producers and engineers who gave us what was and still is the soundtracks to our hearts and souls.

5554127,5,B00B2YH7BS,"A great documentary; intelligent, well crafted. The movie is over before you want it to be. As a veteran studio engineer/musician, I felt that it spoke volumes ( no pun intended) about the way that the recording process has changed over the years; not only with equipment being used, but also in the entire approach to record making. Watch how it was done in an age before every song became perfectly edited and auto-tuned to death.
This doc should be obligatory viewing for all musicians and audio engineers - fans of analog or digital, it makes no difference, regardless of age, or the recording platform they use.
A superb documentary. See it!

I learned a lot about that era of music that I listened to as a teenager. Man, the Neve recording console is something I would love to see for myself. Sound City Soundtrack is a nice example of how real music should be recorded. No effects or auto tune. Just pure organic performing. Favorite track is Stevie Nicks since I'm, well, a huge fan. I like almost every track and even find myself humming them when I'm idle. I bought the CD for the nostalgia since most everything I buy now is digital. That was a good decision.

But the appeal is broadened in the fact that Grohl as a director and producer does an excellent job. Add the fact that this is his directorial debut, it makes it more impressive.

In this day and age of computer generated, auto tuned, fake talent, I found this DVD an homage to all those who have been through the ropes of the early days of recording.

8561861,1,B00B2YH7BS,"I'm sure this would be a good documentary if I didn't have to keep adjusting the damn volume every five seconds. It goes from an interview recorded at a whisper to REALLY LOUD BOOMING MUSIC then back to another whispering interview BACK TO REALLY LOUD MUSIC, and teeters back and forth like that through the whole 1/2 I could stand to subject myself to. Sadly ironic how a documentary about recording artists and sound technicians could have audio so poorly leveled.",1529366400,,466,4.765432098765432

Fascinating and completely well done film. Classic music with new recordings. I am amazed that this is Dave Grohl's first attempt. Truly talented individual.",1525392000,,440,5.041095890410959
