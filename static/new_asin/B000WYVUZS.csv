2993038,2,B000WYVUZS,"I have several multi-channel SACDs/DVD-As. Pink Floyd 'DSOTM', Kitaro 'Sacred Journey of Ku-Kai', Jean-Michel Jarre 'Oxygene', etc... I knew that this was a music only Bluray disc and was excited to hear 7.1 surround.

The music is techno but not good techno. My DENON AVR-4308CI/DENON DVD-2500BTCI sounds better with stereo CDs then this disc.

The most troubling thing was that the slide show of pictures caused my player to spin the disc at a very high speed. Like a CD-Rom being read in my computer. Worried that it would wear out my brand new bluray machine and not being the least bit interested in the music or the slideshow of boring computer generated art - I hit eject and will never play this title again.

2993039,1,B000WYVUZS,"While Amazon does state that a 7.1 channel audio system is required for the full surround experience, they don't say what I have found, that a 5.1 channel system will yield almost no perception of a surround experience.

I find the music to be some of the most uninspired, dull, uninteresting techno I've ever heard, and the visuals are static images that are boring, at best. All in all, an utter waste of my money.",1226188800,,416,4.546666666666667
2993040,2,B000WYVUZS,"The music is not very good.  Even the sound separation does not live up to my expectations (very little, if any, sound from the rear surround).  The visual can be summed up in 1 word: lame.",1204588800,,189,4.222222222222222
2993041,2,B000WYVUZS,"I am a lover of all electronica and I can not say that I feel the same about this disc.  For one, the music sounds dated.  The beauty of most electronica, is that when you hear it for the first time it still sounds new and fresh even though it may be a couple of years old.  When I popped this disc in, I could not help but feel that the music was old.  It sounded like something I had bought in the early '90's.  It is very upbeat, but has that old taste.

The surround part was very dissapointing.  Even with the visuals off, I could not get a clear sense of the sound stage.  In fact, it sounded confusing in some instances.  The only thing that makes this music ""3-Dimensional"" is the fact that it is 7.1 surround encoded.  Each of the channels is so seperated, that it often sounds like each channel is isolated from everything else that is going on.  It did not have that soundstage that envelopes you in a bath of pure auditory bliss.  Sure there is sound coming out of 8 channels of audio, but it does no good with the lack of sound engineering.

For the visuals, I am impressed.  Still images or not, the pics are in true 1080 resolution and not some fuzzy upconverted pics.  Regardless, it was painful having to watch while listening to the dissapointing audio track.

I am using the HD-A35 bitstreaming to an Onkyo 805.  Sure, the infamous DTS HD Master Audio popped up showing me that my Onkyo was ready to flex it's muscles, but this audio track was no workout by any means.

I used to contemplate about buying these compilations in DVD-A when they were out, but I held out.  I thought I was glad I waited, when I saw that I could bitstream the ""High Resolution"" track to my system with the HD DVD version, but just 2 minutes is all it took to be dissapointed.  The only worth that came to my $20 was that it killed my curiosity...ten times over.  Sorry.",1201910400,,1867,4.262108262108262

You can really defiantly hear 3 dimensional structure and movements of sound around you. That is more then exiting and I had never heard anything like this on any surround record.

8226092,5,B000WYVUZS,"From start to finish, this album gives me much pleasure on an almost daily basis.
If I need to start the day feeling uplifted, energized, amused or even relaxed, I can chose many of the tracks and have my mood tended to by this (somewhat) eclectic mix of electronic sounds. The album has been compiled cleverly and each track merges into the next seamlessly. You will all recognise a few of the tracks and I'm sure the tracks which are new to you will become favourites.

I will let you decide which tracks work for you best, as we all know each person's musical tastes vary tremendously. But mark my words, if you enjoy dancey beats and surround sound, this album will not disappoint you! I hope you agree!",1317859200,,707,4.48062015503876
8226093,1,B000WYVUZS,"Well got this disc and the disc ""The Way to Paradise - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality [7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Disc]""
the last one did not even work, tho i paid +80 dollars for the pieces.

Anyway, the disc looks like its burned at home and it got this cheap look a like print on the front. This disc spinned up and showed me sounds and some images.

The sound is just some reaaly bad trance music back from 1999. Most of the times you hear a start with hi hats in back and voice in the front. After a few mins the hi hats also can be heared from the front speakers. I did hear far better products then this one.

The video was just some same back to 1999 digital art on your pc. Nothing more to say, it just looks bad and if ya look to long your head starts hurting.....

so, audio and video are cheap and not even worth downloading for free....da ! ba! i said it!",1283040000,,882,4.051724137931035
8226094,1,B000WYVUZS,"I bought recently on Amazon two Surround Records blu-rays and I'm sooo disappointed!

The first hints were given right after opening the boxes, everything looks so unprofessional:
the covers look like printed with a cheap ink-jet printer, the same for the disc labels. One
of the discs has scratches on it right out of the box. Everything looks like home-made using
a blu-ray burner.

But the real issues started when listening, probably due to poor authoring of the discs or to
poor quality of mastering equipment... or to poor quality of workmanship.

One of the discs, ""E - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" stops playing during
the last track, 5 minutes before the end. The discs freezes there. Fast forwarding a few
seconds and playing again does not help: from there on to the end of the disc there's no sound.

The other disc ""Spatial Dynamics - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" has the
first track unplayable: a few minutes into the song awful noises superposed on the music,
making you jump for the remote to stop the play. Then, for the rest of the disc, there are various
pops and loss of sound all over the place, making the ""Experience"" unlistenable.

Overall, a complete waste of money on those discs... and they didn't came out cheap!

8226095,1,B000WYVUZS,"I've ordered two copies with great excitement over the style of recording only to be disappointed that the DVD will not play.  It's stated to be a blu-ray, but is not.  I have a Panasonic DMP-BD80 ($400.00 Blu-ray player) and it will not play.  I'm very disappointed with this experience.  Also the quality looks like someone is burning and labelling this product from a home office and tossing it in a Blu-ray case.
