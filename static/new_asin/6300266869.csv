7807827,1,6300266869,"Directed by Peter Medak and co-written by Spike Milligan, ""Ghost in the Noonday Sun"" (1973) marked the nadir of Peter Sellers' career  a disastrous, unfinished pirate comedy that Columbia buried in a London vault. Ten years later, the film was resurrected on home video for curious Sellers fans. Columbia did the participants a huge favor by shelving this troubled production. You're better off listening to ""The Goon Show.""",1349049600,4,424,5.235294117647059
7807828,4,6300266869,"'Ghost In The Noonday Sun' is a pretty good sea tale, and adventure film starring Peter Sellers, Anthony Franciosa, and Spike Milligan.
 It's based on the charming children's novel of the same name by Sid Fleishman, and was filmed back in 1974.  The feature has some incredibly gorgeous color cinematography from it's on location filming in Cypress. The Mediterranean Sea has never looked bluer or clearer! 'Ghost In The Noonday Sun' also has an enchanting musical score. The story is a variation on 'Treasure Island' with Peter Sellers as the notorious pirate,...Scratcher.  Scratcher and his crew kidnap an English boy who claims to have the ability to see ghosts.  Scratcher murdered his Captain, stole his treasure map, and took command of the ship.  The map was drawn with disapearing ink, and the superstitous pirate beleives that the ghost of the dead captain will appear to the boy and tell him where the treasure is buried on the island.
 Anthony Franciosa is quite amusing and charming as a Spanish pirate, playing him as a combination of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Spike Milligan is hilarious as a rival pirate.
 'Ghost In The Noonday Sun' was never finished or released by Columbia Studios due to cost overuns and location problems. Eventually after Seller's death in 1981, the producers took the existing footage, and assembled the film for possible release. Instead, it went straight to cable/cassette, which is a pity as Peter Sellers is very amusing as the unlucky pirate.",1059004800,5,1496,5.032388663967612
7807829,1,6300266869,"A strange, bizarre and ultimately sad misfire of an alleged pirate comedy starring the sometimes brilliant Peter Sellers and directed by Peter Medak, who two years earlier directed the terrific ""Ruling Class"" Starring Peter O'Toole.
Obviously something horrible went wrong here during the writing and production. I'm sure the behind the scenes story of this debacle is much better drama and comedy than the finished product.",1044748800,5,424,5.4393939393939394
