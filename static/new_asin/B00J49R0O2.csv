6332625,4,B00J49R0O2,"This is an exquisitely beautiful, mythologically enhanced story of a girl who inherits goddess power, but is too shy to know what to do with it, and the teenage boy whose fate is to protect but initially despises her.  It is better than this description.  But it ends fairly quickly and leaves the story open ended.  However, if you enjoy Japanese mythological characters, glorious animation, and some character development, I recommend it to you.",1395792000,25,447,5.013513513513513
6332640,4,B00J49R0O2,I can say the series was good.  You've got a mysterious girl who blacks out anything electronic and some other mysterious boy.  Things look really promising for this series.  Also a supernatural school in the middle of nowhere.,1439510400,,227,4.921052631578948
6332641,3,B00J49R0O2,"Not a very good series.  There are a lot of gaps in the storyline.  You have a number of episodes where not much happens to further the story.  Watch it on Netflix, but don't buy it.",1439251200,,182,4.0

6332646,5,B00J49R0O2,"This was a cute, fun anime with fun characters you will instantly love.  I will start off by saying that the title for this show is very misleading.  This anime has almost nothing to do with technology other than the fact that our heroine breaks electronics when she touches them.  The general premise for this anime is about a young girl who is painfully shy and awkward around others.  Other elements of this anime are about different types of magic and magic users.  However, overall I think that the supernatural piece of this anime is a secondary theme.  I though the primary theme of this show is about the coming of age of a young girl and the challenges she faces as she tries to change herself.  There are some minor themes of romance, but I would not call this a romance anime.  I know that this is a bit vague, but I do not want to give spoilers away.  The anime is beautifully animated and the voice acting is top notch.  My only complaint like other reviewers is that the series is only 12 episodes long.  This anime reminded me of Fruits Basket, The Familiar of Zero, and Kamisama Kiss. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch.",1406160000,20,1181,4.3963133640553

6332649,5,B00J49R0O2,"Red data Girl sounds much like a series about cyber warfare or something along those lines but it isn't. Actually it's very far from technology based anime. Red Data girl is about a lonely very quiet and timid Izumiko Suzuhara who was raised in a mountain temple by people who were not her parents (though she does see them from time to time but they are to 'busy' to take care of her). Turns out poor Izumiko wants to change and decides within moments of the series starting to cut her bangs and does so without telling her guardians or her parents. Turns out Izumiko cannot use electronics without them malfunctioning meaning she's never really handled a computer or can't even use a cell phone (why I say this series is far from the cyber technology based one the name would imply). The name is somehow linked to the fact she is the last in a line of women who can become possessed by higher beings that can give great power and influence to the world. Izumiko was raised not knowing this till the first and second episode.

The series is wonderful and I'd love to see more of this plot laid out without spoiling it for anybody else. It has a lot of character growth and delves a lot into the supernatural and the unseen, basing a lot of it in Japanese lore. Sadly though it is quite short but still earns 5 stars from me.
The dub is good and didn't pull me away from the series.
I even like how they handed the light love story that plays out. It's not over the top, but it's not super subtle either.
All and all a wonderful series that is far to short for my tastes. Here is hoping funimation puts out a blu ray set in a few months so I can own it in 1080p. There are parts of this that will shine with the colors and the movement in HD.

If you like Kashimashi Kiss, Fruits Basket, and Shakugan no Shana this is definitely worth a try.",1403654400,14,1841,4.2421652421652425

8647923,4,B00J49R0O2,"Saw this on Netflix. Nice animation, confusing weak plot, unsatisfactory open ended ending, also missing was Funimation's translations on things like signs and titles that you didn't need to watch in Japanese to get the translations. So unless you watch the Japanese version you miss a lot of info. Still I liked it enough to put on my list, waiting for Funimation to release a SAVE version, because the current version price is not worth buying",1439596800,,445,4.868421052631579
