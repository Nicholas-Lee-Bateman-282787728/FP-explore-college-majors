8654919,3,B00C5WJ2FU,I'm glad I bought this on bluray however I just wish there were more episodes on it. The akiba season 2 vol 1 bluray has just 3 episodes and no subtitles just like it's dvd counterpart. The one emotional thing it has is the behind the scenes featurette so that's something. I personally would continue to buy these bluray because I enjoyed this show when it was out.,1527552000,,366,4.397058823529412
