8168303,4,6303129048,"Magnum teaches a class about his line of work. A lady in the class thinks her fiance is cheating on her. He is only running out on his bank job. He has discovered some incriminating evidence there. Now his life is at stake.  Magnum and his students try to help this couple. This show has a few twists  and turns especially at the end. Watch for the bar scene. This is the  funniest scene in any Magnum show. The locals can drink their weight in  beer. One huge drunk in particular zeros in on Magnum's round buying. He  proceeds to swill six or seven bottles of beer in succession. MCA should  release all the Magnum, P.I. shows on either vhs or dvd.",955497600,7,650,4.286885245901639
