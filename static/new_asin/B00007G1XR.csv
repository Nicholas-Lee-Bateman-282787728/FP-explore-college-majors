7976323,5,B00007G1XR,"This is a mystery of first-rate caliber by Claude Chabrol.  There are always unfortunate references to Hitchcock whenever Chabrol is mentioned.  Those references show a lack of understanding between mystery and suspense.  Chabrol is bound to suffer by comparison to the master of suspense.  His work, however, is a very good body of work in the mystery-thriller genre.  ""Innocents with Dirty Hands"" is one of his best.

Rod Steiger gives a great performance as Louis Wormser, a retired and wealthy man living with his beautiful trophy wife in Saint Tropez. The gorgeous, statuesque, and elegant Romy Schneider (Julie) is a perfect counterpart to Steiger's role as an inadequate (in a number of ways) husband.  Her plot with a young lover, Jeff, to kill her husband sets off a myriad of permutations in the twists and turns of this excellent movie.  Loyalty, love, greed, lust, and shifting loyalties all reveal themselves in each of the main characters at different times.

The viewer will also enjoy the bravura turn of Jean Rochefort as Julie's lawyer.  Yes, Schneider does appear beautifully nude in the opening scene and it is unfortunate that that has been disclosed by other reviewers.  It takes part of the 'mystery"" out of the mystery.  It also deprives the viewer who appreciates a striking opening scene of a real treat.  The opening scene to any movie is very important in setting the tone and to a movie's plot development.  The scene with Julie, Jeff, and the kite is a masterful opening to a movie well worth seeing.",1336780800,2,1530,4.902723735408561

7976325,3,B00007G1XR,"Like Hitchcock films, this was ahead of it's time for 1975. Of course today it's dated with cliches but consider movies like this started the cliches for all movies that followed. When taken into context Dirty Hands is pretty good.",1303344000,2,231,4.8
7976326,3,B00007G1XR,"I love Chabrol's movies, my favorite being Le Boucher.  Even his worst (can't think of one) is better than most films today and worth watching.  This was not one of his best.  A very complicated story (which is not always a problem) but Steiger was definitely miscast).  The two detectives were adequate but not the sharpest tools in the shade.  While watchable (and Schneider is unbelievably beautiful) I cannot recommend it to those who have never seen a Chabrol movie.  This follows his usual ambigous endings.  Several of his movies are heartbreaking and he makes no easy answers.  This one I didn't care what happened to anyone and it really wasn't shocking.  And his character studies weren't that deep.",1282089600,,709,4.890756302521009
7976327,4,B00007G1XR,"Dating from 1975, this French mystery almost sets a new standard for its superbly convoluted plot and amoral characters.  Director Claude Chabrol has often acknowledged Hitchcock as an influence.  In the first scenes, a love triangle develops and the elements of a classic murder plot are set up.  Then, after the murder has seemingly been carried out flawlessly, the plan begins to unravel.  As layer upon layer is peeled off, it soon becomes apparent that nothing was ever quite what it seemed.  The detectives, who struggle to make sense of conflicting evidence, provide an interesting foil for the characters, who are caught up in their respective intrigues.  This edition is available both in French with English subtitles, and dubbed into English; it works better in the original French.",1229299200,5,793,5.15625
7976328,2,B00007G1XR,"The man who made La Ceremonie & La Boucher is bound to have a few clunkers in his repetoire, & Innocents with Dirty Hands fits the bill.  The film fits into almost every suspense  cliche I can think of;  the most prominant being the stale story of the pretty girl who marries the fat,unattractive man for his money, then finds a young stud who helps plot and execute his murder.

The twists are tired and easy to predict, and while the camera work is skilled & occasionally quite fun to watch, it doesn't make up for the plodding storyline and silly theatrics.

And could someone please tell me why everyone is speaking in French except for Rod Steiger, whose mouth is moving over words in English, yet dubbed and subtittled in French?

If you're looking for quality suspense, keep looking.",1109203200,2,790,4.607142857142857
7976329,5,B00007G1XR,"First at all Rommy Schneider was one of the most beautiful women in all the story of cinema . In this opportunity Schneider plays the role of an unhappy woman who decides break the rules .

An intense drama will be developed in this puzzle of intrigue , erotism, jealous , betray and murder .

The amazing script plays in the european style . Deep focus , expressive close up , slow paced , careful attention to the corporal and visual language , characterized by a clear resources economy plus a script loaded with high caliber tension .

The shame will be flowing through the mind as a new element that it will never leave her .

Intense thriller that reveals once more to Claude Chabrol as the suspense french master .

Chabrol has common roots with Hitccock , but he plays harder . You can watch in Hitchcock a deep respect for the established order , and all his suspense is under this premise . After the torment , everything will reassume a new order (With the glorious exceptions of The wrong man and Vertigo of course) . But Chabrol always walks beyond the limited boundary . And the characters will never be back .

Watch this film . You will love and will adopt it as one your favorites ones.!",1090713600,8,1204,4.400900900900901
