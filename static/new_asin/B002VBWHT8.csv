3994194,1,B002VBWHT8,"They aren't including 2 episodes of Doug? This means that fans have waited years for this series to be released to receive, in the end (1) episodes burned on DVD-R and (2) missing episodes. I can live with the former, but the latter is absurd. If it was an issue with the masters, I know for a fact that this series was aired in full as recently as 2004 on Nicktoons Network because I mastered my own DVDs using my home computer, and they look pretty darn good scaled to 1080p on my current monitor (watching one of the missing episodes NOW as I type this).",1261440000,8,557,4.264150943396227
3994195,1,B002VBWHT8,"I contacted Nickelodeon through Viacom (their parent company) and here's what they told me as to why they are releasing a ""Best Of"" set instead of a Full Season 4 set:

""The complete season could not be produced due to unforeseen technical issues.  However, the episodes that are available are in sequential order.

We regret to hear of your disappointment and invite you to stay tuned to www. Amazon.com/Nickelodeon and Nickelodeon for up-to-date product information.

Sincerely,
Nickelodeon Viewer Services""

I urge everyone to go to the Viacom website to voice your outrage about this decision.  The Nickelodeon Section can be found by changing the Subject to ""Viewer Services"" then selecting ""Nickelodeon..."" for the Show/Category at the website below:

[...]

If enough people voice out their opinion, they will have to fix the ""unforeseen technical issue"" before it's released, rather than re-releasing the same set a few months later with those episodes included.  Enough people complained when they only released half of S2 for Danny Phantom and they fixed that.  This set is only missing 2 episodes.  With all of Viacom's resources, they can easily rectify this.  Even if they have to copy those episodes from videotapes rather than masters, it's better than not including them at all.

I pre-ordered this item and I cancelled it and I urge everyone to do the same until they fix this issue.  We need to let Viacom know that we'll continue to support their CreateSpace efforts through Amazon ONLY if they keep giving us quality products.

Thank you for your time in reading my review.  :)",1261094400,48,1597,5.038167938931298
3994196,3,B002VBWHT8,"Okay, I preordered the Season 3 and Season 4 DVDs way back in November, the 26th to be exact. That was almost a month ago and I have already received my copy of Season 3. I literally checked my e-mail just minutes ago and I received an e-mail from Amazon saying ""The producer of this item has alerted us that not all of the original episodes from Season 4 are available for release. As a result, they've changed the title to ""Doug - The Best of Season 4"" and updated the list of episodes it will include."" After reading that I did my research and found out that the only episodes that will not be included are ""Doug's Bum Rap"" and ""Doug's Babysitter.""

Really? So now it's going to be labeled as ""The Best of Season 4"" and exclude 2 episodes? How does that even fit the bill of ""best of?"" It doesn't. I've been a fan of this show since I was a young boy growing up and I think it's dumb to even release this season without those 2 episodes. I think we can all agree that we want to own the complete series, not the complete series minus 2 episodes. I hope that whatever issue it is with these 2 episodes being released gets resolved soon. I don't wanna settle for less but at the same time if that's as good as it's going to get I might as well get what I can. Amazon, please don't disappoint us. This issue is one that must be resolved.",1261094400,19,1337,4.142307692307693
3994197,5,B002VBWHT8,"Is it just me, or was this listing for ""Doug: Season Four"" and not ""Doug: The Best of Season Four"" originally?  I'm pretty sure I'm remembering accurately.  Especially when you view the cover art and it fails to display any 'best of' nonsense.  Due to the fact that I pre-ordered this weeks ago, I think I may be entitled to shout ""bait and switch!""  The most important thing to me (and probably everyone else here) is that we eventually own the COMPLETE series.  Please Amazon, don't disappoint us.  Also, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.",1260403200,3,544,4.556701030927835
3994198,5,B002VBWHT8,"I was ecstatic to preorder Doug seasons one and two from Amazon's Made On Order DVD Create A Space. Watching the first two seasons took me right back to my childhood and reminded me how truly fun and well written children's television used to be. After watching those first two seasons I began to worry Amazon might not release the remaining seasons. I can't say how happy I am to have Doug's fourth and fifth seasons. The fourth season contains the following 22 eleven minute episodes (11 full half hour episodes altogether), and two twenty-two minute holiday specials, of those the this collection is only able to give us the two specials and 20 eleven minute episodes (10 full half hour episodes, Doug's Bum Wrap and Doug's Babysitter are marked in the list below with a * as they are NOT INCLUDED in this set.):

40 Doug's Math Problem/Doug's Big Feet
41 *Doug's Bum Wrap*/Doug and Patti Sittin' in a Tree
42 Doug Door to Door/Doug Tips the Scale
43 Doug En Vogue/Doug's Mail Order Mania
44 Doug's Birthday Present/ Doug's Fan Club
45 Doug Runs/Doug Clobbers Patti
46 Doug's Treasure Hunt/Doug's Brainy Buddy
47 Doug's Ripped Off!/*Doug's Babysitter*
48 Doug's in the Money/Doug's Sister Act
49 Doug Throws a Party/Doug Way Out West
50 Doug Graduates/Dougs Bad Trip
51 Doug's Halloween Adventure
52 Doug's Christmas Story

(NOTE: WITH *_* on each side means it wasn't included in this set)

This is such a well written show. A lot of shows nowadays aimed at preteens focus too much on the wrong things. They still try to have a lot lessons, I'll give them credit for that, but they always make the main character's lives too perfect, more perfect than I feel your average preteen feels their life is. They've stopped trying to give the audience something to relate to and started giving a young impressionable audience something to buy into. Shows nowadays, in my opinion, are rarely about relating to the common experience most of us have of feeling like underdogs, slightly out of place and just wanting so badly for a few things to go right. Doug is such a show and deserves credit for being such, it relates to it's audience but never patronizes to us and takes every issue as seriously as we did or might have at that age.

As much as I love this entire series and each individual episode in it's own way I especially love season four. The end of the series run on Nickelodeon was marked by the episode Doug Graduates. It's a great episode that brings a close to Doug's time in sixth grade with his friends and deals with the anxiety many of us feel when leaving elementary school. Then I still remember watching Doug's Halloween Adventure and Doug's Christmas Story for the first time as a child of six or seven years old with my older sister who introduced me to the show. I remember taking it all so serious and wanting to know how Doug would get out of his problems at the spooky theme park ride or with Porkchop's trouble over the holidays. They don't make holiday specials the way they used to anymore.

Anyone who may be worried about the quality of these episodes because they are DVD-R, I wouldn't. Like I've stated, I own the first two seasons of this show on Amazon DVD-R and they play great on all my DVD players. On top of that I own several other Nickelodeon series released on DVD-R such as Rugrats, Hey Arnold! and Rocko's Modern Life and they all play great. I tend to be a rather uptight person about things feeling 'of quality' and have never been bothered by these sets. The episode quality is that or better of the shows when they originally aired in the nineties.

That said the sets do have very simple DVD menus and come in very simple DVD cases with rather basic artwork but it all looks nice enough and gets the job done. My only issue with these Nickelodeon sets, me being a purist, is that I would prefer the option of watching the opening theme before every episode but on these sets it only plays before the first episode on each disc. I believe they do this to preserve the quality of the episodes because of compression issues that could start arising and I'm aware that most people skip show openings anyway, so that said it's forgivable (despite the fact that this shows theme is so great). The other thing is not to expect any sort of special features, just the episodes themselves.

Though it is a bit of a shame to not see proper DVD sets released of such a great series, if you're like me and many others and love these episodes you'll want to be able to own them and this is a great way to do it and to possibly convince Nickelodeon there would be a market for their older series in proper sets. I still hope that one day we'll see shows like Doug and Rugrats in proper sets with possible special features and remastered quality but until then I can't recommend this product enough. FIVE STARS based on the quality of the previous sets and the quality of the episodes themselves. Thanks for your time.",1257897600,8,4949,4.529082774049217

Don't get me wrong there are other great shows out there, but too me Doug hands down number one. There was no show before it and after that would ever compare with Doug. Doug is just one special show that showed the difference in the mentality that was going into shows back then, compare to nowadays. Doug is one of the shows too start off the golden age of nickelodeon and it had four excellent seasons. This show I do recommend to parents too watch with their kids, because this is a real family show, not like the movies and shows your getting today.

However, this release of Season 4, the last season of Doug (Disney's Doug didn't happen in my eyes) is an absolute insult. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this DVD is missing two episodes- ""Doug's Bum Wrap"" and ""Doug's Babysitter."" I see no excuse for the exclusion of these episodes. Technical problems?! These episodes were aired on Nicktoons TV just a couple of years ago. If they can't be copied from their original masters and only a duplicate source, so be it! Also, it's not like these two episodes come from the same 24 minute full length episode. ""Doug's Bum Wrap"" was originally paired with ""Doug and Patti Sittin' in a Tree"" and ""Doug's Babysitter"" was paired with ""Doug's Ripped Off!"" What technical issue could have affected one of these episodes and not the other, much less this happening twice.

Though I have always felt like these Nickelodeon burn-on-demand products were always overpriced by $10 or so, I could at least justify my purchase with the quality of the show. Despite the uninspired packaging and lesser quality media used, the shows themselves are gold. Plus the picture quality is just about as good as we can ever expect these shows to look (as we can't even get a formal DVD release, the idea of a Blu-ray is laughable.) However, this time we don't even have the complete show! Viacom has always handled the release of their shows badly, yet the sloppiness of this set is ridiculous. This set is the equivalent of the Beatles releasing ""The Best of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" and excluding ""A Day in the Life."" I chose that song in particular as the two missing episodes are among the best in the season. The album would also be released on CD-R, without any linear notes, and with an MSRP of $24.99. I'm off topic now. So in closing, please resist the urge to buy this, especially if you're a huge Doug fan. Hopefully this version will be discontinued and Amazon will release Season 4 in its entirety.",1284163200,2,2104,4.655913978494624
3994282,1,B002VBWHT8,I will not buy this one until I get a compleate season. I LOVED this show but at the same time I don't like wasting money. Why buy something that's incompleate. And the fact that they are manufacturing it only when the DVD is ordered makes me wounder if this isn't mearly a stop gap until they release the full season. Why waste my money on something that's incompleate?,1280620800,,370,4.3768115942028984
3994283,5,B002VBWHT8,"Great item. Any and all ""Doug"" DVDs we can get we will. My 26 and 24 year old grew up with Doug and now my 10 year old enjoys watching it. Doug and his gand have so many funny antics...what memories for those kids. a great family series.",1278288000,,237,3.9583333333333335
3994284,3,B002VBWHT8,"Don't waste your money buying this DVD. Don't get me wrong I love watching Doug, but I was very disappointed that some of the episodes were not shown on this DVD. I don't think this is the Best of Season 4 like Nickelodeon described it. They need to stop selling this horrible DVD and sell a new Doug DVD with all the episodes on Season 4.",1265587200,,339,4.151515151515151
3994285,1,B002VBWHT8,"I've been waiting for Doug to be released on DVD for years.  I've been waiting for a home release since the damn thing actually aired back in 1991.  None came.  Now, in 2010 we're about to get the final set of the original Nickelodeon Doug, and what happens?  They skip the two best episodes of the season.  Why?  Can we at least get a reason?  Is it a problem with the masters?  Just use video!  These are being burned to DVD-R as it is, so I doubt anybody would complain if it got us the complete set.

As much as it pains me to say this, I will not be buying this set without the missing episodes.  I refuse to be bait-and-switched over an issue so easily remedied.",1265068800,,668,4.140625
3994286,4,B002VBWHT8,"There was two more episodes missing from this season. If I can remember right. I know one of them is when Doug and Judy have a babysitter while their parents go away for something. What was the other episode that went with it? I really enjoy watching Doug, now that I own all of the seasons. It does bring back memories. If I'm missing anymore episodes, please tell me.",1264896000,,369,4.36231884057971
3994287,1,B002VBWHT8,"Absolute OUTRAGE!

Now, I know what you're thinking: this guys another one of those crazy people who gets upset about special features or the way the packaging looks or other unneeded bantering of releases. I'm not crazy; I am very, very disappointed.

I'm very upset of the fact that no one can take the time to find these two lost episodes and put it on the DVD; Jim, are you seriously Ok with this?
Why not just post-pone the release until they find them. Because let me tell you, due to the way this has played out, I would not be at all surprised if a full season 4 is never released.

I hold Doug in, an almost embarrassingly, high regard as being one of the top 5 biggest influences on my upbringing. I know you probably just laughed, but I loved Doug when I was a kid and have recently come to realize the major effect he had on my life. I will simply not support this release.

This is once again a great example of the industry's ridiculousness with how they market our hearts and youth, and feed on us throwing money at them and I guarantee they expect us to buy this DVD now and still buy the full version later on its release. And you know what, most will probably do just that.

3994288,3,B002VBWHT8,"I've been waiting for season 4 to come out, but when I purchased it, I realized that this DVD is missing 2 episodes: Doug's Bum Rap and Doug's Babysitter. And those were good episodes too. No wonder that they named it ""The Best of Season 4.""",1263427200,2,241,4.260869565217392
3994289,2,B002VBWHT8,"Really guys? It's essentially the entire season minus two episodes and you're calling it a ""Best Of""? ""Best of"" normally consists of 4-5 of the best episodes from the season not the whole season minus two episodes. Otherwise I'd be ordering ""Best of Star Trek: The Original Series"", is that also the whole series for $10 minus one or two episodes? The title of this set of laughable.

It's more close to ""Doug: Season 4 and a half-ish""

Thought about ordering this set back when I thought it was the whole season but I won't be doing that anymore. This is one of the problems with unofficial studio releases. Maybe I'll revisit this if a proper season 4 is released or if the episodes show up in a later season.",1261440000,5,711,4.461538461538462
