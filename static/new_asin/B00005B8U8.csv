But in return for her help, Himiko is told the strange tale of how Miyu found Larva.  And on top of that, all three have to join forces to battle the most poerful shinma yet.  And it doesn't end there.  Himiko leaves Kyoto for a short time to go to where she grew up.  There, she is confronted by a strange and terrifying house from her past, and finally learns why Miyu is really hunting the shinma.  Both tales, not unlike the two previous ones in Volume one, display beautiful animation and brilliant plots mixed with a breath taking musical score.  The perfect item for any serious anime collector.",994896000,12,767,4.637037037037037

7937058,5,B00005B8U8,"This is the OAV (Original animated Version/Video) of the newer release of Vampire Princess Miyu. Here we have Miyu the cute, mischievous, and playful vampire. She has WAAAY more personality compared to the gloomy Miyu. The OAV has only 2 Vol. Of course if you've seen the newer release first you might still disagree with the OAV but, its worth checking out.",1374192000,,358,4.790322580645161
7937059,5,B00005B8U8,"Originally released in the late 80s, this anime is a bit outdated but thanks to a fine remastering of vol.'s One and Two of the VPM (Vampire Princess Miyu) OAV's that came out before the more recent TV series, which I haven't seen yet but is said to be more fluff, the picture and sound quality are just like new.
Eternally 13, Miyu is a vampire unlike any other. She often appears as a schoolgirl in broad daylight with an innocent, childlike persona, but a hidden darkness lies within her falsified demeanor (or is it?). Her laughter rises up into the air, echoing all around you, cutting through those who desire her razor sharp kiss, yet she claims to not be the monster that spiritualist Himiko makes her out to be for her destiny is to capture and return the Shinma (creatures that are half-Demon, half-God) to the darkness where hence they came from, but with the help of her devoted guardian, Larva, who was once a evil Shinma himself.
In ""Fragile Armor"" (this is my least favorite of the four), Himiko agrees to help Miyu defeat a ghastly armored monster. In return, Miyu tells the tale of how she met Larva, her silent companion. Later, Himiko learns of the tragic fate of a husband and wife. Meanwhile, a beautiful young man with a frightening laugh circles and waits. Who is he? What is the secret of the armor? And what of the Shinma? Can Himiko put the pieces of the puzzle together in time?
""In Frozen Time"" (my absolute favorite!), Himiko travels to Kamakura, a childhood home. There, she dreams of herself as a child, running in terror from a mysterious mansion. Now the mansion has a new tenant: Miyu. Miyu at last tells all -- of her discovery of her true nature after her first meeting with Larva, of the secret concealed by Miyu's parents, and of the night that Darkness and Shinma gathered together. And, finally, Himiko realizes what it is that has bound her destiny with Miyu's...forever!
Extras on this DVD include a lavish image gallery set to the gorgeous, melancholy music of Kawai Kenji.

7937060,5,B00005B8U8,"This DVD contains the last two episodes of the OAV (not the made for TV) version of 'Vampire Princess Miyu.'  The four OAV stories are not simply stories of the supernatural with the intervention of Miyu as a given.  Instead, they are as much the story of a spiritualist (Himiko) who believes she must oppose Miyu, but is gradually coming to realize that Miyu is not as evil as Himiko initially believed.
In the first DVD in this series, very little effort is made to offer any explanation for Miyu and her fate.  Instead, Miyu drops dues ex machine into one of Himiko's cases.  This time, we are given considerable insight into Miyu's origins and her relationship with Larva.
In the first episode on this DVD, 'Fragile Armor,' Miyu is forced to ask Himiko's help in stopping a rampant suit of armor that keeps insisting it is a Shinma.  In addition, Larva has been trapped in a mask, and Miyu hopes the young witch can free him.  Miyu knows the spirit is not a Shinma, and is powerless to attack what is actually a human spirit.  However, Himiko can effect the latter, and the ensuing chaos drives out the real Shinma from hiding.  Miyu demands Larva's release and finally enters into full battle with the Shinma.
'Frozen Time' has Himiko traveling to her childhood home, where she intends to investigate an old mansion that disturbed her dreams several times.  This old mansion has a habit of disappearing and reappearing and Himiko discovers that it is the original home of Miyu.  For the first time we are given a glimpse into the tragic story that drives Miyu.  This is almost the only time that much is made of Miyu's history.  The television series focuses more on Larva's story.
Artistically, this DVD is probably the high point of the both the OAV and TV series.  There is a dark, art nouveau flavor to the work, and a great deal of intense dialog.  It is unfortunate that the OAV series did not survive for a few more episodes, although the TV series has much that is admirable it lacks the intensity provided by the original series.",1041033600,7,2043,4.59228650137741
