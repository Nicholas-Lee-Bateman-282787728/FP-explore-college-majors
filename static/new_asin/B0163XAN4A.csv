8735519,5,B0163XAN4A,"I watched seasons 1 & 2 on YouTube and had to get them when season three came out.  The DVDs came earlier than estimated and undamaged, very well packed. Kudos to BLG World. The first season is censored and the floating red winged Ds over the naughty bits are distracting, but I am watching it just to refresh my memory before getting to season three.  I checked out all three disks on my laptop. Disks 2 & 3 did have a glitch where they would not respond to the mouse commands, but by using the cursor keys and enter key I can navigate the menu easily, set up and play both disks. I like to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles as the emotions seem more real in the original Japanese. This is a very funny and entertaining show.  Unfortunately for the rest of you, I seem to have gotten the last one.",1476921600,,808,4.233766233766234
