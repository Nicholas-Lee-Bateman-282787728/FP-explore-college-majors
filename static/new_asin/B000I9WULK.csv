2654118,2,B000I9WULK,"A sequel to Faster (ibid). It's about a rivalry that never was (the title refers to the nicknames of Valentino Rossi, Nicky Hayden and Colin Edwards), at a racetrack woefully hyped and out of date, on an occasion (the return of MotoGP to the US) that no one except some die-hards cared much about. Mark Neale, who managed access to the riders on an intimate scale in Faster, here goes for inane comments and filler. Neale tries to create an epic out of a very ordinary GP race. It's all rather tiring. Good race footage, though. Skip it or buy it used...there should be plenty about.",1162080000,4,583,4.509433962264151
2654119,4,B000I9WULK,"-Review of 'Preview Edition' (95min long, no extras)-

  I must confess, I've been a motorcycle racing fan for quite some time, but you needn't be to enjoy this film.  However, perhaps Mark Neale's excellent film 'Faster' might make for a better primer to the world of MotoGP -the highest echelon of motorcycle racing.  While THAT film gives a broad overview and (recent) history of MotoGP, this film's focus is only on one race, the 2005 USGP.  Held at the technical and challenging track--Laguna Seca (in Monterey, California)--it's the first MotoGP race in America in 11 years.

  The Doctor, The Tornado & The Kentucky Kid is a close-up view of the chaos, drama and tension that a single MotoGP race weekend never fails to deliver.  It's both a behind-the-scenes look at the racers and their teams, struggling to adapt to the track, and detailed highlights of the race itself.  The film is shot well, with revealing interviews about the track, and some very nice action shots.

  It's a bit grainy and low-res looking (read: spontaneous) and not quite as polished as Mark Neale's 'Faster'.  It is, however, an exciting and in-depth look at one of the finest races (and racing series) in recent memory.  You might want to wait for the inevitable Special Edition/ Director's cut, as the lack of extras was a little disappointing; 'Faster' had a whole extra DVD worth!  Either way it's a fun watch, two thumbs up.",1160006400,3,1414,4.825

2654128,3,B000I9WULK,"....it's late 2015 as I'm posting this, so I've bought and watched Faster and Fastest already, (Hitting The Apex is impossible to get right now) so this documentary is well made and interesting, but compared to the more current offerings it's a bit primitive and doesn't captivate you like the other DVDs. If you're a serious Motogp fan and love Nicky Hayden, he definitely gets some time, and he's a very likeable guy, as is Colin Edwards. Rossi is of course in here, but there's much more Rossi in the other DVDs, so if you're more interested in Rossi, spend your money on Faster, Fastest, or Hitting The Apex instead.",1448150400,2,620,4.6454545454545455

2654137,3,B000I9WULK,"I love motorcycle racing and have attended the MotoGP at Laguna Seca several times. It's one fun, sensory-overloading blast as well as a total ""scene"" off of the track. Doc, Tornado & Kid was very watchable for me, primarily because I'd just as soon watch motorcycling of any kind as anything else.

Still, I wasn't knocked over by it although I'm not sure I could blame the production itself. It simply may not be the best subject matter when the ""real thing"" is so mind-bogglingly outrageous.",1340064000,,494,4.744186046511628

2654139,4,B000I9WULK,"Was a good documentary. Been watching Racing for almost 20 yrs. Love it like I did then. They don't spend as much time on the other riders as they do Rossi. I like Rossi, but this is about 3 riders not jist Rossi. It was good though",1324684800,,232,3.9574468085106385

2654142,5,B000I9WULK,"If you enjoy motorcycle racing you'll like this movie as it covers the 2005 MotoGP round at Laguna Seca. Not only is the race interesting but the insight as to how the riders were thinking is great.

2654143,4,B000I9WULK,"If you like motorcyling, are a racing fan, or both, this is a great video.  If you are a MotoGP fan, you should go and get FASTER, first, then this one.  It's alot to watch, but it's really interesting to get a bit of 500 GP history along with the transition to the MotoGP bikes.  This video is a great story about an American making it in a foreigner dominated sport, and winning his first MotoGP race, on his home track.",1220227200,,422,4.185185185185185

lame.",1219104000,2,271,4.42
2654145,4,B000I9WULK,"This is a really well made doc on a single motogp race weekend.  The problem is in the title of the movie.  The title shoud've been ""Hopper, the tornado and the kentucky kid"". Doesn't really have the same ring I guess.  John Hopkins is featured more than almost any other racer in the film, and rightfully so. He's a good solid racer.  But I was mislead by the title into thinking Rossi would be featured more.  Nonetheless, this is a really entertaining and informative film on motogp.  The bonus disc is really good too. Really good interviews.  The on board camera on Rossi's M1 is great! But I think that's for the more serious of race fans.  If you are just becoming interested in motogp, buy this DVD!",1213747200,,707,4.46875
2654146,3,B000I9WULK,"I ordered this DVD before it came out from the main site, and not that I regret doing so; it just wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be.

2654148,4,B000I9WULK,"I actually bought this for my boyfriend for a Christmas gift.  We love motorcycle racing.  He wanted this since it is the sequal to Faster.  I watched it with him.  It was interesting.  I'm sure that if we didn't like motorcycle racing it wouldn't make a difference one way or the other.  If you are buying this for buying this b/c you are a Rossi or Hayden fan I don't know if I would.  Me being a fan of Hayden's I was kinda disappointed that they didn't go into him a whole lot.  Rossi either.  Most of the video seemed to be on Edwards.  Which he was entertaining, I just expected it to be more of Rossi and Hayden.",1198972800,4,619,4.126050420168068

2654153,5,B000I9WULK,"A fantastic recounting of the first american moto gp in years. The track footage is second to none, and even includes a bit of history. This is all about coming back to Laguna Seca, the race and the racers who raced it.",1175731200,2,219,4.238095238095238
2654154,5,B000I9WULK,"This was an outstanding accounting of the race.  I know, because I was there.  The program captured all of the complexity, engineering and courage needed to compete, and the additional CD with the recordings of the bike cameras was fabulous.",1174521600,8,241,5.0

2654156,3,B000I9WULK,"Overall, the movie was done well.  I just haven't figured out why Valentino Rossi was bypassed for interviews when his name is in the title of the documentary, yet other motorcyclists that are not in the title received plenty of air time.  Since Valentino Rossi is the biggest name in MotoGP, how can you leave him out?

I do, however feel that there was a lot of pertinent information given, especially for a newbie like me that is just learning about this competitive sport.",1172016000,8,476,4.642857142857143
2654157,4,B000I9WULK,"I agree w/most of the other reviewers here that in comparison, ""Faster"" is the better film.  The scope of Faster is larger (an entire MotoGP year, rather than just one race), but both films attempt to explain the excitement, dangers and other complexities of the series.  There are more interviews w/the non-American riders in the first film and you get a sense of the different characters and personalities involved in this international event (Max Biaggi, a person of interest & rival to Rossi in the first film is barely mentioned in the 2nd film & how appropriate since he wasn't involved in the 2006 MotoGP).  I would describe the premise of this film as MotoGP's return to Laguna & the Americans challenging Rossi on their home ground.  Most of the film interviews are w/Hopkins, Edwards & Hayden, Americans (And while Americans may not be the most articulate English speakers, I can understand their slang better).  There are a few interviews w/Rossi, but they are nothing substantial, just very brief commentary from him (and subtitled, if anyone needs subtitles IT'S Hayden).  The reason I think it's a must for any moto race fan is that it not only documents MotoGP's return to the the States, but also gives you Hayden's first GP win.  A turning point for his GP career as he goes on to be the 2006 MotoGP champ over Rossi. Only real complaint is the inclusion of a couple of pointless shots of Brad Pitt watching the race (People like him are the reason I can't go to Laguna; they push the ticket prices into the stratosphere).  Regardless, I will buy the next in this series, and the next, and ...",1168992000,10,1610,4.684397163120567
2654158,3,B000I9WULK,"I went to the USGP in 2005, and it was a spectacular event.  The event itself was more exciting than the actual race itself, where Hayden totally dominated.  I was excited to get this DVD in the mail and see all the behind the scenes look at the USGP but ended up disappointed.  The quality was very bad, and you can see all the pixelization.  They should have included all the bonuses on the 2nd disc and left the first the pure documentary by itself.  That way they could have preserved the quality of the footage instead of trying to fit too much onto one disc.  Don't let the title fool you.  If you are expecting a lot of valentino Rossi footage and interview, you will be let down.  There is about 5 minutes total of Vale on this disc.  They should have named the movie ""The Tornado, the Hopper, and the Kentucky Kid"" since the documentary focuses on those 3.  Guess if they had put that on the cover, Vale fans wouldn't even blink at it, but they got us!",1164585600,7,961,4.259668508287293
2654159,5,B000I9WULK,"I've been a motorcycle-racing fan since the early 80's, and unless you're a fan, you're going to fall asleep watching this movie.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I was also however able to attend the event in person and watch the drama unfold at the 2005 USGP.  Mark Neale's film 'Faster' is certainly a better introduction to the world of MotoGP.  That film bestows the viewer with overview and (recent) history of MotoGP.  The Doctor, The Tornado, and the Kentucky Kid's focus is only on one race, the 2005 USGP. Held at what many regard as one of the most technically challenging tracks in the US.  I've ridden on it at speed and can confirm the challenges it delivers first hand.  Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca is located on the picturesque Monterey Peninsula, California, home to Cannery Row, and the stunning 17-mile drive.",1162339200,5,819,4.76595744680851
