7887707,4,630519713X,I really enjoyed the story and the characters. It was heart wrenching the way African Americans were treated by Caucasions who claim to believe in God. The untold amount of inhumane treatment will hurt until the end of time. I appreciated the brave front of the black men and women depicted in the film. I showed this to my grandchildren who found it amazing that we lived through such a time.,1279238400,,393,4.549295774647887
