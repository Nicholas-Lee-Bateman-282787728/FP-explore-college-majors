7785572,4,B01HD2TOWW,"This is a good if episodic ugly duckling story with a decent script, humour, pathos and some excellent performances, particularly from the talented Patty Duke (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner for ""The Miracle Worker"" (1962) and ""fresh"" from the giant turkey ""Valley of the Dolls"" (1967). Patty won a Golden Globe award for this and in the following year won an Emmy as Best Actress in ""My Sweet Charlie"", beating Dame Edith Evans and Shirley Jones. The film follows Natalie's life as a plain Jane from childhood to young adulthood and it ends with her liking herself she is and now approaching life with hope and calm and some confidence. This is after an affair with her very attractive ""artist"" neighbour James Farentino, and being shattered that her beloved uncle (Martin Balsam) does not match her high expectations. Good cameo by Al Pacino as a lowlife at the school fance. Also starring Nancy Marchand, Elsa Lanchester and Salome Jens.",1477440000,7,946,4.955974842767295
7785573,5,B01HD2TOWW,Ecstatic to have this on DVD!  One of Party Duke's award winning performances finally comes to home video with this Australian (Region 4) import.  I had read somewhere that it was region free but once I got the disc in my hand I realized it was 4. Imagine my delight when it played on my el cheapo Wal-Mart player! No features no subtitles but good picture/audio quality.,1474416000,12,371,4.522388059701493
8764997,5,B01HD2TOWW,Me Natalie was released in 1969. It starred Patty Duke in one of her best roles as a young girl getting out on her own in New York City. I loved this. ! Fans of Patty Duke will like this the most.,1538352000,,196,3.6904761904761907
8764998,5,B01HD2TOWW,"A favorite old movie about a young girl coming of age.
When I was a teen I could relate with this movie on many levels.
Now, as an adult, it's funny, dated, a little corney, but still charming.
Still love it.",1535673600,,208,4.097560975609756
8764999,4,B01HD2TOWW,"Maybe dated but still a favorite of mine. Very early female independence and overcoming stereotyping.
Patty Duke has always had something special to offer, so sad that she couldn't see that in herself.",1531180800,,201,5.121212121212121

8765001,5,B01HD2TOWW,"Have so many sentimental memories tied to this film. Although the critics panned it, it captures the late 60's in some important ways. I especially related to Natalie's introversion, her coming of age and questioning of society, her place within it, and her own self-worth. Not really sappy at all, but an experience we all have to grown through. I think the critics who panned the film were far too harsh, or perhaps unable to confess that Natalie's journey is relatable to most folks.

And I absolutely LOVED Mancini's musical score, finding it a perfect accompaniment, despite some critics calling it too brooding.  Annh-- what do critics know anyway. The ""In and Out of Love Montage"" is brilliant from its quiet, simple Wurlitzer electric piano passage to its riveting, cataclysmic orchestral climax. As for the vocal solos, Rod McKuen's raspy, whispery voice seemed appropriate for delivering his own lyrics.

The movie's a great time capsule, the music is unforgettable, Patty Duke's acting is right-on-the-money, and I'm so glad to finally have it on DVD (and the soundtrack on CD!) after all these years!",1514851200,,1112,5.065573770491803
8765002,5,B01HD2TOWW,"Waited so long for this DVD to come out. A wonderful story about a plain Jane finding herself no matter what she looked like, although I do not think she was that homely! A wonderful performance by Miss Duke. The film transfer us excellent although there are no extras, it is a film not to be missed. Highly underrated. A beautiful score by Henry Mancini and Rod McKuen.well worth the price!",1502064000,2,391,4.52112676056338
