1749402,5,B00006FMCA,"I did not have the privilege of seeing this in an IMAX theatre; rather, I borrowed the DVD from the library. In its 41 minutes, I was riveted and in complete awe. The photography of that very mysterious Antarctica was exquisite: the 2000/01 photography as well as the original. I cheered the great Shackleton and his crew, but was concerned about their faithful dogs (I'm not a PETA freak, I just like good dogs). I know there are other, longer and more detailed versions of Shackleton's trip. I'm happy to have seen this version. It was concise, and told me enough to know that Shackleton is a great man, an adventurer to be revered and admired in perpetuity. A bleak adventure, children should see this as a lesson in perseverence and fortitude. I'm humbled.",1094947200,,760,4.67910447761194
1749403,4,B00006FMCA,"I watched this and although thoroughly enjoyed it, agree that it is a bit too short even for an IMAX. I then watched the 3 DVD collector's set and sat riveted to my seat for almost 5 hours watching both the film and the history of Antarctic Exploration extras. So, if you want the IMAX version, which is short and sort of sweet to the point, then here it is. On the other hand, if you want to really get a feel for the whole adventure and become part of it, then get the 3 DVD box set. I will watch both again and again. Just an unbelievable story whichever version you watch.",1075248000,,576,4.106194690265487
1749404,2,B00006FMCA,"41 minutes including the credits.  You can not cram this story into 41 minutes.  I had hoped for much more when I made the purchase.  The are trailers, but no other extras and no making of.  This will be the last IMAX purchase that I ever make.  The NOVA version on PBS is much better.
The 3 DVD set Shackelton - The greatest Survival Story of All Time has a better Shackleton documentary than this IMAX DVD.  It also has an Antartica documentary which is also quite good.",1073088000,8,472,4.306818181818182
1749405,5,B00006FMCA,"My name is Ryan Mullins and I produced the DVD of Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure. Let me start by stating that I had no choice but to input a star rating in order to register this comment, my Mother suggested 5 stars...
I am writting in response to the discussion regarding the bad batch of disks that went out at the beginning of this release. Much to our shock and horror, an out of synch Dolby Digital 5.1 track appeared on the first run of disks. At the time we took all measures available to us to pull back and quarantine as many of the bad copies as possible. No further bad copies have left our plant since September, 2003. Unfortunately DVDs circulate among a lot of different stores and sub-distributors over a a long period of time. Unsold copies can be returned into the system and go back out without being noticed. We do try and catch them but there are literally thousands of DVDs flowing through the system on any given week.
As stated by the editor, any bad copy will be cheerfully replaced by the vendor who sold it to you. Be assured that we are doing are best to rectify this problem. If it has a blue dot on the back cover over the Image Logo it is a proper copy.
My apologies to anyone who has been inconvenienced by this mistake.
Sincerely,
Ryan.",1058918400,24,1271,4.367088607594937
1749406,4,B00006FMCA,"Huge icebergs, snow and chilled water everywhere, a single wrecked ship with couple of life boats and 27 men with unified saga - one man's dream of crossing the Antartic by land.. Well, this is Shakleton's Antartic Adventure.
The mission, looks simple, as long as things go well. Weather is not always to our tune, especially in the Anatartic. Water turns snow, and, beleive it, you have to wait till the next season to come and melt away the snow. And they waited, at last to know that the ship (Endurance) that brought them is of no use. The life boats help them to continue their voyage, with limited water and food but the objective never shaken. The team splits, takes rough and tough ways, to complete their mission.
I wonder what is the point in making such a mission in a land of unknown. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, especially in IMAX, the mission did not make sense to me at all. Like the one Steve Fossett made in balloon across the world... What is the point in making a mission when we have sophisticated flights that take us. Well, that is my view.
One can definitely enjoy visiting the country - no one dares to - sitting from your couch, for sure.",1031961600,,1175,4.444444444444445
1749526,5,B00006FMCA,Very good tool to use at Corporations to transmit how we can work like a team using the team work concept.,1362700800,,106,4.095238095238095
1749527,5,B00006FMCA,"It is hard to believe that this is a true story.  A story of ""if it weren't for bad luck"" that worked out in the end.  The amazing story is well done with actual footage, stills and re-enactments that put you in Antarctica and an excellent narration by Kevin Spacey.

One interesting note:  an indicator of Global Climate Change can be seen in the retracing of Shackleton's trek across across South Georgia.",1359072000,,407,4.611111111111111
1749528,5,B00006FMCA,"My 4 year-old's review:  ""BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!  It's great. Now GET IT!""  My take:  This was her first IMAX movie and then she had to have it to watch over and over.  Well made and not at all scary.  No mention, for example, of what happened to all the sled dogs.  (Presumably eaten.)  It's only 40 minutes long and great for a child with an interest in science and adventure.  There is even an interactive quiz at the end.",1312848000,,424,4.073170731707317
1749529,1,B00006FMCA,"I never got the video, and I was charged to my credit card. Really dissapointing!!!",1276214400,,83,4.6
1749530,4,B00006FMCA,Purchased this dvd for presentation in a 3rd grade classroom. Had just enough detail and length to keep the kids interested.  Two thumbs up!,1269820800,,140,4.833333333333333
1749531,5,B00006FMCA,"I bought this book for myself and ended up buying 6 more to give as Christmas presents. My daughter in-law, who doesn't cook, found it to be a wonderful book.",1269216000,,158,4.3
1749532,5,B00006FMCA,"This is an excellent docudrama that serves as one of the all time great case studies in Leadership.  Rarely in the history of man is there a more impressive example of leadership during a crisis.  Shackleton's twenty-two month journey is a testament to the importance of values, vision and mission.  This video is a just presentation of Shackleton's unbelievable accomplishments.",1265846400,,379,5.283333333333333
1749533,5,B00006FMCA,"I got it because spacey narrorates this documentary. I was pleasantly surprised this was a great adventure you just can't belive, truth is stranger than fiction",1260316800,,160,5.1923076923076925
1749534,1,B00006FMCA,"My ""one star"" review is not for this video, which I have not yet viewed, but for Amazon.  Despite stating that Amazon only sells corrected copies of this DVD, they are continuing to sell defective copies.  Today I received four copies that do not have the blue dot below the Image logo on the back cover of the DVD.  I was hoping this problem had been corrected since the gentleman who wrote that he had this same issue in March, but I guess no one at Amazon has paid attention to this problem.  I just notified customer service but wanted to warn anyone who might be thinking of ordering this DVD from them.",1253836800,,608,4.353982300884955
1749535,5,B00006FMCA,"This film is incredible!! Unbelievably beautiful, with a great musical score!! Correction, though -- Kevin Spacey is NOT an actor in this film, he's the narrator. There are no real ""actors""...the crew and the 3 mountaineers portrayed the original Endurance crew, and did a great job!

I've had my initial copies for 2-3 years, which have the blue dot on back (meaning the corrected Dolby track), and also an inside cover slip with a night photo of The Endurance, and a list of Scene Selections.

Amazon assured on its site that they sell only the corrected, blue dot, versions of the film, so I ordered 2 more as gifts, and 5 to have on hand for friends and such. And AMAZON is the vendor...not someone outside of Amazon.

The copies that I just received from Amazon are NOT the corrected blue dot versions, nor do they have the inside slip cover with photo and scenes.

I emailed customer service (I couldn't understand the foreign accent of the rep that answered my phone call), and they assured me that they would overnight replacements, and I could then send the ""wrong ones"" back. (I was afraid that this choice of words spelled trouble, and this proved true.)

The replacements came today, and THEY TOO ARE THE DEFECTIVE VERSIONS! I have now inquired of a completely different vendor (outside of Amazon), to see if THEIRS are the corrected version. I'll send ALL 12 of these defective ones back to Amazon, since I can't seem to talk (or email) with anyone who understands the issue.

I've had great success with Amazon for years...but the fact that they appear to outsource their service to a foreign country is not only disappointing, but frustrating as well. The level of understanding simply isn't there.

But the film is INCREDIBLE, and everyone should see it!!!",1237248000,3,1772,4.752442996742671
1749785,5,B00006FMCA,"Saw this as the accompanying feature of another IMAX movie, and it turned out to be the highlight of that day. Very inspiring movie about human resilience and will.",1234137600,,164,4.689655172413793
1749786,5,B00006FMCA,"I first saw this at an IMAX theater at a museum and I immediately wanted my whole family to view this very inspirational saga.  I'm excited to own it finally.  This is a fast (45 minutes), but well-done view of the incredible ordeal experienced by Shackleton and his crew stranded in the Antarctic.  My 17 year old son commented that this would be a good DVD to use in leadership camps and training. It is a true life verifier of the power of loyalty and tenacity.  Amazing and empowering!",1231113600,,489,4.46067415730337
1749787,5,B00006FMCA,"This is a great video for teachers to use in connection with a unit on Explorers, Teamwork,Sacrifices, or Leadership skills.  I used it with 5th graders and they were throughly engaged.  There are lesson plans on-line to go with the movie.  The photography is fabulous.  You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a 45 minute documentary that has the amazing backdrop of the majestic Antarctic.",1228521600,,403,4.882352941176471
1749788,4,B00006FMCA,"This item, along with ""The Endurance"", are fantastic multi-media resources for a unit on Shackleton's adventure.  These DVDs pair wonderfully with the book we cover with our seventh graders: ""Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World"".  Both are highly recommended for teachers as well as lovers of documentaries.  The original photographs and film from expedition photographer Frank Hurley are amazing and really neat for the kids.",1202428800,,427,5.4393939393939394
1749789,5,B00006FMCA,Shackleton was a great leader in impossible circumstances and this story high lights some of those leadership skills.  Saw it first on Imax and was very impressed.  That is what prompted the purchase.,1169251200,,200,5.03030303030303
1749790,5,B00006FMCA,"This film is one for the ages.  A good synopsis of the Shackleton story that focuses on the leadership and togetherness that took place on this adventure.  I am a corporate leadership trainer who has used this film to teach hundreds of people about true leadership and teamwork.  This film is a must see for anyone in a leadership role or hoping to one day attain one.  It is also a very good story for families, adventurists, historians, and more.  Definitely worth the time and money.",1140393600,2,486,4.604651162790698
1749791,3,B00006FMCA,"This is a good, overall telling of the exciting adventure of Earnest Shackleton's expedition attempt to transnavigate the South Pole.  The videography is, as usual, quite spectatular.

However, two other recent versions of this amazing tale are both worth mentioning.  ""The Endurance - Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition"" (2000), with Liam Neeson, and PBS NOVA's ""Shackleton's Voyage of Endurance,"" (2002) with David Ogden-Stiers narrating, are both better accounts because you really get more of the in-depth impact of what did and could have gone wrong on the expedition.  It is incredible that, in an era where tradegy from expedition travel was not that uncommon, the fact that all 27 men made it back alive - in such a harsh yet beautifully intriguing environment - is truly amazing.  If the IMAX version captured your interest, these other two will rivet you to your chair.",1112659200,33,888,5.225352112676056
1749792,5,B00006FMCA,"A very inspiring concept executed very well by Imax. Full marks to them for doing so. Team leader Shackelton and his team of 27 men start from South Georgia for antarctic trip. Their ship is trapped in snow and they are forced to disembark. Hope to recover the ship as the ice melts keeps them near it for 4 months and tragically as the ice starts melting after 4 months it shatters and drowns the ship. Starting a journey on lifeboats and touching different grounds of ice and leaving so many of colleagues at different places, Shackelton finally reaches the land after 17 months and manages to go back with some help and get back all his men. A masterpiece of human courage and endurance that is very rarely seen. A must see",1111795200,3,726,4.466165413533835
1749793,4,B00006FMCA,"A beautiful, romantic, but too short treatment of Shackleton's expedition.  My son and I saw this after seeing the Discovery documentary ""The Endurance"" and after watching the Kevin Branagh film--and this order worked.  From the Discovery program you get the facts, the movie (with all its flaws) was more than adequate, and then the IMAX is a gorgeous treatment that combines the period photography of expedition shutterbug Frank Hurley, stunning modern shots of the landscape, and just a judicious bit of historical re-enactment (thankfully not too much).  Well done!  But we're done with Shackleton for a while.",1101081600,4,614,5.298969072164948
7967870,5,B00006FMCA,Fabulous story!  Wonderful weaving of actual footage and photos with re-enactments. Well done!,1463184000,,94,6.230769230769231
7967871,4,B00006FMCA,"Having just returned from an incredible Aurora Expeditions voyage retracing the route of the Endurance party on the hundredth anniversary of the expedition's rescue, I can tell you that the breathtaking part of this production for me was seeing the actual sites we visited in IMAX.  The movie is indeed ""made on location.""

Even if you haven't been there, this film is a visually impressive digest of Shackleton's legendary Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition with 27 comrades aboard the ill-fated Endurance from 1914-1916.  The colors are crisp, cool and bright, as is Kevin Spacey's narration.  The swooping and swirling aerial shots of mountains, glaciers and sea ice are gorgeous even on a small screen.  The brief historical re-enactments are impeccably done and don't look hokey as they usually do in these recap-type documentaries.

I'm going to ask my family to see it before I bore them with my 2,000 photographs of our expedition, which included kayaking at Point Wild where the men were stranded on Elephant Island, and a hike following the last portion of Shackleton's route into Stromness and rescue, so they will have the basics of what happened and will understand the context of my pix.

For those unfamiliar with the story, this film is a good introduction.  For those who are familiar, it is an arresting depiction of the actual sites as they look today (e.g., the beach at Cape Wild is gone) where key episodes in this amazing saga took place.",1461369600,,1462,4.987654320987654

7967878,5,B00006FMCA,"The Shackleton story is required reading for those of us working in Antarctica ([...] so I've read most every version of the story.
