8277245,4,B001AEG888,"Not bad Mexican-made, Spanish-language (sub-titles available) Santo vs. bad guys flick.  This time bad guys are after Santo's goddaughter's inheritance.  There is the usual amount of wrestling bouts.  At one point the bad guy wrestlers attack Santo and the good guy wrestlers in the street while they are escorting the girl.  While the guys go at it the girl just stands there and watches, instead of getting the cops.  What was she waiting for, the victors to claim her?  I bought the DistrictMax Inc. DVD release, with a different cover than pictured, and the quality was just fine.  Recommended for El Santo fans.",1416960000,,616,4.922330097087379
