7830696,5,6302754496,"for all of us die hard dark shadows fan, the only disappointment in this episode was that they did not plan to continue the story. it ties up a lot of loose ends but leaves you with one hell of a cliff hanger.

now if you just have to know what happened, you can always watch the original dark shadows. they used to rent them at blockbuster. that is how i found the continuing story. i hope someone puts this on dvd someday.",1105660800,,424,4.108433734939759
