7936535,1,B00005B1Z7,"I received the 4 DVD ROM set in a timely manner. Amazon service was the best I have experienced online. However, I could not enjoy the full set since the two DVD ROMs containing the Lucy Episodes would not play in either of two different players or my PC. I attempted to return for replacement but my replacement was mis-shipped. Still waiting to straighten out the situation and receive the correct replacement item. This is the first time I have purchased DVDs that didn't work right out of the sealed plastic wrapped box. The two that did work were good documentaries on Lucy and Desi, their histories and their production company. I long to see the Episodes once I receive the proper replacement product.",1015804800,6,708,4.717741935483871
7936536,5,B00005B1Z7,"Review 3 of 7 of the set reviews:  ""The Funny World Of Lucy"" gift set is the greatest DVD for Lucy fans who want to learn about her life, see lost episodes, and the favorite ""The Lucy Shows.""  This set is a four disc treasure.  The first disc in this set is ""Lucy's Lost Episodes.""  This DVD begins with an Ed Sullivan ""Toast of The Town.""  It has all the qualities of an ""I Love Lucy"" comedy.  The shows on this set, just to tell you, are not comedies except for one which I will talk about later.  The next one is when Lucy and Desi Arnaz appear on a ""What's My Line"" game show.  It is not until the end of the show that the panel figures out who it was.  The third show is a show with Bob Hope, Lucy's partner in three of her movies, was the husband.  It starts with Lucy bringing home a seal and Captain Blinestone is sleeping in her bed.  Ethel is still in this film as the same actor, Vivian Vance, and Desi as Fred.  Captain Blinestone is played by the person who really plays Fred, William Frawly.  Rickey is played by Bob Hope.  I won't tell you what happens next.  The show that is next is a second apperance on ""Toast of the Town.""  This one was to promote the latest film.  It has all the qualities of an ""I Love Lucy"" program.  The next is a twenty minute promotinal film for the ""Westinghouse"" appliances sponcering the Desilu playhouse.  On the way, Lucy wants appliances and when the dealer comes, she plays tricks on Desi to order appliances.  Find out what happens on this DVD.  The next section is a serie of outtakes in Lucy's movies.  The final one is on ""The Bob Hope Show"" when she is talking about her experience on the ""Lucy Show"" ""Seal-A-Go-Go.""  That ends the first disc.  There are no special features on any of the discs.  The second disc is called ""The Funny World of Lucy Volume 1""  You will learn about her early years and in movies as a star.  The beginning is like the basis for ""I Love Lucy.""  One thing you will find out about is that she was a Communist!  Lucy married Desi Arnaz.  The child born on ""I Love Lucy"" was actually Desi Arnaz Jr.  In the end, Lucy made two movies with Desi, The Long, Long, Trailor, which is my favorite of all of Lucy's movies, and ""Forever Darling,""  which Desi said they had more fun doing.  The first disc even features trailers for her movies.
The third disc is the sequel, ""The Funny World of Lucy Volume 2."" It begins with Lucy and Desi buying out ""Desilu Studios"" and shows clips from the ""Westinghouse"" promotional film on the first disc.  Then there is the divorce between Lucy and Desi.  But that didn't end Lucy's Career, she made another series, ""The Lucy Show.""  She acted in this for many years until when color came.  They made a few color shows and then went into another show ""Here's Lucy.""  But this wasn't all she did.  She made a popular Broadway show, ""Wildcat.""  She made ""Yours, Mine, and Ours"" and ""Citic's Choice.""  Then she made her last series, the eight episode, ""Life With Lucy.""  It wasn't at all popular.  Shortly after the series aired, Desi died.  Then, after the film ""Mame,"" Lucy died on a April day in 1989.  The fourth disc is two great ""Lucy Shows.""  These shows are ""The Barbershop"" and ""The Plumber.""  Find out what happens in the DVD.  This ends the overview of this wonderful set you will enjoy again and again.  This set is a MUST for Lucy fans all over the world.  The set is compatible with All DVD players.
