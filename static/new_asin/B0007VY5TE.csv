While some of it is interesting, the title is a bit misleading and it certainly is not worth paying for - it should be included with Amazon Prime.",1450483200,,320,4.262295081967213
8174953,5,B0007VY5TE,"The best clips on this disk are the ones of Germany a year or so after World War Two ended. So many WW2 documentaries focused on how we fought and won the car but ignore the consequeces of the war itself. This time around we get to see exacatly how the German people - most of whom did not fight us, were forced to live in poverty and bombed out buildings after the fighting was over. There are also a lot of intersting clips about the war effort at home and how we helped support our boys when they were fighting.",1148428800,,514,4.099009900990099
