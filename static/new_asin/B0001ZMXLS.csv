8018953,4,B0001ZMXLS,"The Road to Memphis is one of the better documentaries in the Scorsese Presents the Blues series. It's more focused, more comprehensive, and thoroughly indicates who's who when a who speaks. It contains interviews and performances with living blues legends: famous ones like B.B. King, somewhat famous ones like Rosco Gordon, and not-so-famous ones like Bobby Rush. This film entertains with its backstories, songs, performances, peculiar characters, behind-the-scenes and vintage clips, and unintentionally funny moments. It offers the viewer both familiar tunes and tunes to discover. I've seen two others in this series of documentaries: The Soul of a Man directed by Wim Wenders and Feel Like Going Home directed by Charles Burnett, but The Road to Memphis's director Richard Pearce never leaves the viewer hanging and proves that he can successfully handle a subject like the blues.",1523404800,,887,5.434782608695652
8018954,5,B0001ZMXLS,"Very interesting look at a former hub of vintage blues. Almost anything associated with Scorsese is gonna be great (he produced this, not directed). Absolutely recommended for anyone with a  love of blues music.",1390262400,,211,5.205882352941177
