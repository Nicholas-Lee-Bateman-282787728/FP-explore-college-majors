4338183,4,B004EPYZUS,"Ethan Hunt is forced to go underground with his team in order to prevent a Russian nuclear missile from striking the United States. Due to the sensitivity of Russian and American relations, he is performing his mission with only a wink-wink from his superiors. This one contains the requisite action and excitement and is the best film in this trilogy since the original. The storyline is not overly complex, and I found myself invested in the action, at times feeling the thrills of the onscreen excitement right there in my seat. This is a fun movie to watch.",1324684800,40,561,4.73469387755102
4338184,5,B004EPYZUS,"I JUST CAME FROM SEEING MISSION IMPOSSIBLE GHOST PROTOCOL AND AS USUAL I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I DID WISH THAT VING RHAMES WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WHOLE MOVIE BUT MAYBE THE NEXT ONE. THIS MOVIE WAS ACTION PACKED AND AS USUAL TOM CRUISE DELIVERED RIGHT ON TIME FOR THE HOLIDAYS.  I WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS MOVIE THAT I ACTUALLY WENT TO THE THEATRE A DAY EARLY BUT LUCKILY I BROUGHT MY TICKET ONLINE AND I WAS ABLE TO USE IT TODAY.  I CANNOT WAIT TO GET THE DVD TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION.  I WATCHED ALL OF THE PREVIOUS MISSIONS BEFORE THIS RELEASE SO I COULD BE ON TOP OF MY GAME.

TAKE YOURSELF A HUGE BREAK AND RUN, DON'T WALK TO THIS MOVIE!!!! GO TOM CANNOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.

4338185,5,B004EPYZUS,"I won't repeat the story - others have described it. I just want to say that this movie was about as exciting as it gets. Totally edge of your seat most of the way through. Great story with tons of action, and even some humor that really worked sprinkled here and there. The stunts had me holding my breath. The locations were incredible. The actors are charismatic and appealing.

Sometimes sequels don't live up to the original. After all these Mission Impossible movies, I didn't expect this one to be this good, but this may be my favorite of all of them. Action flicks don't get much better than this. I can't wait to see it again. This is one to own.",1324339200,5,656,4.377049180327869
4338186,5,B004EPYZUS,"I won't be cliche and tell you that your mission, should you choose to accept it... You know the rest.

Without a doubt, this is the best of all the Mission Impossible movies, including the original. Over the years, the MI franchise had become something of a cartoon of itself. So, it seemed appropriate that Brad Bird should be chosen to helm MI4 Ghost Protocol. As the Oscar winning director of the Incredibles, he made animated cartoons seem very real. Now, he's made Mission Impossible real again. He's injected a fresh breathe of confidence, humor and camaraderie into a series that sorely needed it. He's not only re-invigorated the franchise, he's re-invigorated Tom Cruise's career as an action star. With this movie, Tom is back on top.

You'll notice that there is a lot of the Incredibles in MI4 Ghost Protocol. That's not only because of Brad Bird's influence, but because the Incredibles was a humorous homage to action films. You could say it's the IMF meets the Incredibles. That is not a deterrent. It's a tribute to a director who can think outside the proverbial action box. This isn't the same old, same old. The movie is much more upbeat and doesn't take itself too seriously. Which works to its advantage.

Tom Cruise has never been better. This isn't the brooding Ethan Hunt of previous movies. He's a man on a mission. pardon the pun. To make a complicated story short, the IMF has been shut down and disavowed after a massive explosion at the Kremlin. That explosion is blamed on the IMF. But, it was nothing more than a diversion to steal a nuclear detonator by a terrorist hell bent on ensuring peace on Earth by starting a nuclear war between the super powers. It's up to Ethan, and his cobbled together disavowed team, to hunt down the nuclear terrorist and save the world. simple.

Once you have suspended disbelief, sit back and enjoy. The cast is uniformly excellent. Jeremy Renner plays an IMF analyst suit (with more than desk skills at his disposal) reluctantly recruited into the field. Paula Patton is the former team leader of a mission gone bad sent to rescue Hunt. Simon Pegg is back as Benji, the computer/technology genius. While it may seem like he's there just for comic relief, he is an integral part of the team. There are no dull moments. The movie has a quick pace, fun one liners and mind blowing special effects filmed in glorious IMAX. Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner both have sensational action sequences. Tom Cruise isn't the only actor who gets to jump off buildings. And if this movie is any indication, Jeremy Renner is going to make a fantastic Jason Bourne. This wasn't a vehicle for just Tom. Everyone gets a piece of the action. It's a true throw back to the original TV series.

and wait until you see the car. James Bond would trade in his Aston Martin for it.",1324080000,221,2821,4.656626506024097
4338187,5,B004EPYZUS,"The first and third Mission Impossible films are pretty enjoyable (not a fan of the 2nd), but nothing compares to the action and stunt scenes pulled off here. The plot is not mind blowing, though it's engaging, and people survive enough near death close calls to make James Bond blush, but the cast, gadgets and fight scenes make up for everything. I hate to admit it but Tom Cruise is really good here. He is believable and even did all of his own stunts. Believe me, after seeing this film that is quite a feat. Simon Pegg provides his usual humorous moments, Jeremy Renner is a welcome addition to the team and Paula Patton holds her own, as well as, filling out a tight green dress nicely.

IMAX is the way to go. The world's tallest building scene alone makes you feel like you're right with Tom Cruise as he hangs 1,300 feet above the ground. Our IMAX theater didn't get the first 6 minutes of The Dark Knight Rises (I almost cried), but at least I saw the new trailer. I had already seen TDKR prologue online anyway, but it was low quality and a far cry from experiencing it on IMAX.

Even if you are not a fan or have never seen a Mission Impossible movie, you can jump right in with this 4th installment and still have a blast.",1324080000,4,1236,4.323275862068965
4338188,4,B004EPYZUS,"Brad Bird steps into the live action arena directing this fourth installment of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise.  He is best known for terrific animated classics like ""Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles.""  Let's hope he continues along the path of live action.  I think this is the best action based thriller I've seen all year.  We pick up the story years after IM agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has lost his wife.  He is in a Russian prison and a plan is afoot to break him out.  Why now?  In the opening sequence (shot in IMAX) an IM agent (Josh Holloway) has successfully obtained secret launch codes from nefarious types intent on World destruction.  As he is about to rendezvous with his team he is killed by another assassin.  She escapes with the codes.

Hunt is extricated and sent on an impossible mission to obtain confirmation codes from the Kremlin.  In the grand scheme of thing, this isn't all that important.  Following plot protocols that go back decades, American good guys are out to save the world from political zealots.  I'm not minimizing all this.  There must be a story and frankly, this one can actually be followed.  It is all a setup however for some of the best aerial cinema photography ever shot.  While I'm sure CGI was used on occasion, it's not evident.  The stunts sure seem real and let's give some credit to the cast who perform them, especially Cruise who is at the top of his game.  The small 4 person team (now disavowed by the United States) escapes a botched Kremlin theft and chase down the real thief, Hendricks played by Michael Nyqvist (""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"").  Beautiful Paula Patton plays a no nonsense agent Jane Carter.  Simon Pegg as techie Benji and Jeremy Renner as agent Brandt complete the crew and add a bit of tension breaking humor.

This leads to a thrilling set of events involving the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the tallest building in the world.  I would suggest seeing this in IMAX will leave you squirming in your seat.  I would also add that while only a few scenes are actually shot using IMAX cameras, they blend seamlessly into those shot in 70 mm.  This film is fast and furious with nonstop action that will leave you invigorated and worn out at the same time. I can't wait to see it again.

BLU RAY UPDATE:

This is my first viewing since seeing this action thriller on the IMAX screen.  While, it loses a bit of the big screen luster seeing it only on a 63"" plasma there is plenty of movie to keep up with.  The Blu ray transfer is, in a word, spectacular.  Brilliant colors, great detail, dynamic panoramic shots are exemplary.  The audio is a lossless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 and it is equally good.  This movie has sound effects that range from soft electronic hums to chaotic action sequences and a massive sand storm.  It's all good.",1324080000,6,2832,4.579681274900398
4338189,5,B004EPYZUS,"Nonstop, edge-of-your-seat action, amazing stunts performed by Tom Cruise himself, whirlwind special effects. This definitely trumps the others in the Mission Impossible franchise. There wasn't much in the way of plot or spy-games/intrigue, but they made up for that by building more rapport with the team members and loading in more actions sequences. Very awesome film--well worth the money spent.",1323993600,2,399,5.666666666666667
4338190,5,B004EPYZUS,"In his short career I want to share that if he is not THE BEST he is one of the most talented of the modern breed of ACTION Directors. He shows with this addition the versatility to run a diversity of genres. I went with my wife to watch the advance screen of this movie on IMAX. And we have a remarkable experience pack with tons of gadgets, stunts and a very talented cast. For the rookies to this movie franchise they won't be disappointed or clueless. For the M. I. experienced audience this will achieve and maybe impress, I WAS!, for the multi sequences full of action, stress, and laughs too. In these struggling economic times + struggling lack of entertaining movies, I will highly recommend M.I. GHOST PROTOCOL, if is in IMAX it will add a lot to your experience. As in Dark Knight: IMAX, all the high action sequences of Ghost Protocol are in FULL IMAX! THANK YOU BRAD, TOM, JJ and THE IMPRESSIVE CAST and CREW for this experience!!!",1323907200,2,944,4.46242774566474
4338191,4,B004EPYZUS,"In director Brad Bird's first live action film, ""MI:GP"" succeeds what it sets out to do.  It is a tight action spy film with some great sequences and awesome gadgets.  Brad Bird is the director of some truly excellent films; albeit they are animated, but great none the less.  His films like ""Ratatouille"", ""The Incredibles"" and ""The Iron Giant"" were all wonderful animated films with a lot of heart and good direction.  Bird has proven to this reviewer he has the skill for live action feature films.

""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" brings us back to our hero Tom Cruise while he is locked up in a Russian prison.  Of course the inevitable happens and he is broken out of jail in a really great opening sequence.  Cruise and team assemble; their mission, prevent a nuclear launch.  Unfortunately, their plans are curbed when the team is implicated in a massive bombing.  The President decides to initiate ""Ghost Protocol"" which completely dismantles the ""IMF"" and paints Cruise and team as rogue agents.  Their new mission, clear the IMF's name and save the world.  Pretty basic stuff for a Mission Impossible movie.

Pretty basic, yes, but what a ride it is.  First, I'd like to congratulate the scriptwriters on finally making a M.I. film with a tight and aggressive script.  There was hardly a dull line in the entire movie.  With the writers having primarily a television background they were able to get their points across quickly and effectively.  Second, is of course the action sequences.  Realistic, invigorating, suspenseful....just downright awesome.  It is surely a fun ride and if you have a chance to see it in IMAX you will be blown away during the Dubai sequences.  Location is another gem in this movie; Dubai, Russia, India are beautifully shot and give some very nice eye candy.  But for me, the highlight were the gadgets and spy sequences, it wouldn't be a Mission Impossible film without great gadgets right!?  Ghost Protocol doesn't disappoint.  From gloves that stick to glass, visual projections and everything in between there is some really cool stuff in this film.

I can't go without commenting on Tom Cruise doing his own stunts.  Regardless of what you think of him on a personal level, one has to admit him doing his own stunts was pretty incredible.  There are some really hairy situations he gets into and I was very impressed he went the extra mile, I think it helped knowing he was actually doing the stunts while I was watching.  I would say overall the acting was good, but not overly impressive.  This isn't a drama film after all so I'm not taking any points away.  Why would you go to a Mission Impossible movie for great acting?  You go for the action, and if you keep that mindset, this film will be worth your time and money.",1323907200,4,2777,4.7510460251046025

4339320,5,B004EPYZUS,"I am Shere Khan the tiger and I most delightfully approve this message.

 Action spy movies in the past whether they be a mixture with comedy or drama either or many times feel like the story gets no where. Many movies where government agents or ex-marines or mercenaries are at war with wicked organizations as entertaining as they are always feel as though their plots get clunked up with so many sequences of over the top action, the principle story feels undervalued. With this film however it is not the case. Since the day I saw this in theaters, I walked out thinking ""WOW! That was the best action spy movie ever!"" To this day my opinion of it does not change. It is the best action spy movie and the best of the Mission Impossible film series.

  I do enjoy the MI series a lot. The previous films are entertaining but do not have the feeling of this film. The first MI was good for the time it was made but I felt it was lacking in action and suspense. The second MI was terrible to be honest. The story was dis-interesting as much as the characters in it were. The third MI is third best right after the fifth, the one that I consider to being second best. This one is the top dog. From the amazing performance by Tom Cruise yet again as the iconic spy Ethan Hunt to the scene where he climbs the tall building in Dubai. This film portrays the realization that trusting your fellow agents is impossible. Most especially with the events that occur in MI: Ghost Protocol. In the film, the IMF are blamed for the bombing of the Kremlin, forcing the president of the US to authorize Ghost Protocol, shutting down the IMF. Ethan Hunt and his team consisting of Agents Carter, Dunn, and Brandt (Jeremy Renner from the Avengers) are secretly tasked with discovering and exposing a terrorist by the name of Cobalt who has dastardly plans for the entire world.

  Hence what was mentioned about not being able to trust your friends. MI 4 contains many sequences of satisfying, awesome action, drama, humor, peril, and very interesting characters. There is never a moment where the plot feels like it is going below the grade scale. The music is brilliant, adding to the depth of the conflict the characters are going through. The cinematography looks so very life like, beautiful, realistic, to sum it up every positive word out there describes MI 4. The actors bring so much life to their characters you forget they are just actors playing them. The iconic theme song always gets you amped up in your seat. The movie does have heart in it too, that makes you understand the agents themselves as being more than butt kicking, hacking, disguising, manipulating government agents and being ordinary human beings like the rest of humanity. This move is more than 5 stars to conclude. No complaints, no mistakes, no areas of improvement. Your mission choose to accept it is to agree with me on this one ;).",1478822400,,2904,4.571153846153846

4339421,4,B004EPYZUS,"Tom Cruise is a marvelous actor, especially when it comes to action flicks.
Despite the fact he is getting older - although I have to admit he is aging more gracefully than most of us - he still manages to perform admirably in physically demanding roles and that is never more apparent than it is in ""Ghost Protocol."" He dangles from buildings - really, really, tall buildings - and walks along ledges in Moscow. He gets in fights with bad guys, still looks suave in a tuxedo, drives like a maniac, sprints after sinister villains, and escapes from a Russian prison with relative ease.
That's a plus.
Also a plus in this rip-roaring adventure movie is his supporting cast. Paula Patton is gorgeous and she can fight; Simon Pegg is, well, Simon Pegg; and the addition of Jeremy Renner to the MI team is a solid move. Michael Nyqvist - who has put on a few pounds since his ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" days - is a convincing villain despite the fact he doesn't get a lot of screen time until near the end of the movie.
Unlike previous MI installments, this movie is more introspective. We learn more about Cruise's character - Agent Ethan Hunt - than we did in the previous films and that, to my way of thinking, is a good thing. Cruise's performance in ""Ghost Protocol"" is also more measured, his lines delivered with more thoughtfulness, and his movements on camera more precise. Whether that is because he is getting older, or because director Brad Bird coaxed this performance out of him, is immaterial. In the end, he comes across as more believable than he did in the past.
Where this movie fails, in my opinion, is in the writing. I didn't expect to see a movie that would broaden my intellectual horizons, but I did expect a plot that was, well, a little deeper than this one. We know that Nyqvist's character, for example, has slipped off the deep end but we don't really know why. (He does make a speech in which he briefly mentions that nuclear war may be an evolutionary necessity but surely there has to be more to it than that.) The action is nonstop but the plot... pretty thin.
And it's because of that failing that this movie falls just short of 5 stars.",1476057600,,2171,4.49873417721519

4340995,4,B004EPYZUS,"Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol is the forth film in the franchise and sees Tom Cruise(War Of The Worlds) reprising the leading role of the globe-trotting super spy Ethan Hunt. Throughout the series Hunt has evolved from team player to lone wolf and now in Ghost Protocol he must become a true leader of a team that, for the first time, he didn't choose.

The film blasts off into overdrive from the minute the gates open and rarely lets up, it's one hell of a ride and there's enough action and gadgets here to please any fan of the spy film genre. The plot is fairly straightforward; the bad guy obtains the key to the ultimate weapon and plans to destroy the world with it. Hunt and his team, working without the support of the IMF, must stop him at all costs. It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged but it never gets so complicated that you risk getting lost while you're immersed in the mind- blowing stunt sequences. One thing fans of the series will probably notice this time around is that Hunt is more 'human' when it comes to the action than he has been in most of the previous outings. Not everything goes to plan and if he gets hit or falls down it hurts. Sure he's still a super spy and can do things most mortal men would never try in a million years but the added vulnerability and consequences of those actions gone wrong lifts the film to a new level.

but in Mission:Impossible-Ghost Protocol that level of personal rivalry between protagonist and antagonist was a bit lacking. It's not that Michael Nyqvist (Abuduction) didn't deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Hunt, it's just that there are so few of these moments that he is, in many ways, almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.

Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3, the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a 'behind the desk cameo' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt's rogue team. Pegg's natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a much-needed element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.

Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Paula Patton(Precious) as Jane Carter and Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner(The Town) as William Brandt, and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona's with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we're not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.

Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie. If you don't enjoy this ride then entertaining you is a mission: impossible. Amazing music by Michael Giacchino (Lost), Costume Design By Michael Kaplan(Fight Club) and Direction By Brad Bird(The Incredibles)The Best The Mission Impossible of all time I doubt MI:5 Can Top it. 9/10",1451952000,3,3104,4.694852941176471

4341039,5,B004EPYZUS,"Ahead of the release of the fifth in the series it has been my mission to re-watch all four, a series that started way back in 1996.
Your Mission Should You Choose To Accept -
The only polite thing to do if your locked-up in a Russian prison if the doors become open - you walk out....
'Ethan Hunt' (Tom Cruise) is sprung from the Russian Prison by Computer and Technical Whiz 'Benji' (Simon Pegg) and agent
'Jane Carter' (Paula Patton) ...of course there is a mission afoot for which Top-Agent 'Hunt' is essential, they have to infiltrate
the Kremlin, however the mission is aborted when 'Ethan' picks up a radio coummunication which indicates a bomb is about to
be detonated inside the Kremlin itself.
The Soviet Secret-Service point the finger of responsibility for the outrage firmly toward the M.I.F
'Ethan' and his team 'Benji' - 'Jane' and joined by 'Brandt' (Jeremy Renner) set out to clear the agency of responsibility for the act,
it soon becomes obvious the bomb attack was a diversion to cover a theft.
The team uncover a plot by a known activist to start a nuclear war.......the teams mission against all odds is to save humanity from
the very real threat posed, it will stretch the resources of the team to the limit, of course, they dare not fail.......is it really Mission
Impossible ??
Nice to see 'Ving Rhames' featured in a brief cameo role ...
For me, the mission series just gets better every time , great action, terrific special-effects and even more well-staged and
extravagant stunts along with a good measure of humour.
Entertaining watch....again.

I am now done with watching anymore Mission Impossible movies.",1449014400,,321,4.4576271186440675

4341154,5,B004EPYZUS,Enjoyed,1448755200,,7,7.0
4341155,4,B004EPYZUS,"I approached this film the way I approach any Tom Cruise film - it'll have its good moments, it'll have sassy dialogue, big grins, determined grimaces, and that ""now I get it"" look as realisation dawns on Tom's face that you get in every single one of his films. I'm not a fan, but most of his movies are pretty decent.

Then I saw JJ Abrams' MI:3, and my opinion changed - great film (and it would have to be if the franchise was to survive, after the sheer awfulness of MI:2). But would the fourth instalment be more like the third film, or fall back to the yuck of the first two?

Turns out this one is pretty good too. The first live-action film directed by famed animation director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille), it's got JJ Abrams as a producer, so things are looking good already; the story is edgy and starts with a mystery - where is Ethan Hawke's wife from MI:3? We learn the story throughout the film... or do we? Lots of ups, lots of downs, some ridiculous stunts at the world's tallest building (undoubtably filmed for the sake of it), great Kremlin scenery, nice interaction with Simon Pegg, a sexy killer who looks like Taylor Swift, a crazy train retinal scan scene, a twist on the ""self destruct"" cliche, something new with masks, and more of that cheeky Bond-esque music. There's also amazing stuff with a colossal sandstorm - first seen in the distance, then as an oppressive, gigantic shadow.

The battle at the end is a bit too video game-like (reminds of the robot factory scenes from The Phantom Menace, which is not a good thing), and a bit of a cheezy ending. But that's okay.

Not too many bonus features to this one, but we do get a mini documentary about the filming of the sandstorm scene in Dubai and Vancouver, which is done linearly, splicing together real scenes from the sequence with backstage scenes - for example, you see a scene where the camera zooms towards a skidding car, and then you see the actual boom truck in action performing that scene; it's fairly seamless and very cleverly done, something you don't really see among bonus features. then there's a scene about the props, where a prop man shows just how many silver briefcases were created for the filming - one that was strong and would survive being thrown about, one that was padded so that you could smash people with it in a fight scene, and then another that could house equipment. Nice. Finally, there are two deleted scenes, one called ""Confusion In The Van"" (2:10) that shows the in-van conversation post-rescue when Cruise's team briefs him on recent goings-on; it's completely different from what was in the movie, and would have taken the film in a complete other direction than what we saw, and as such is fascinating as to what it hints towards - that the script was radically changed (and improved) mid-course, and that remnants of a whole nother film exist somewhere. Finally, there's ""Benji Almost Caught In The Kremlin"" that adds vital information about that scene and probably should have been included! Oh well...",1448582400,,3060,4.650646950092422

This hot mess is badly paced, badly edited, the dialog is incomprehensible, the CG effects look fake and green screen projections shot by 2nd unit crews can't hide the fact that the actors never left Canada.

4344487,4,B004EPYZUS,"""Ask no questions and believe only what you see.  No, believe half of what you see.""
--Burt Lancaster, ""The Crimson Pirate""

Lancaster might well have been talking about 2011's ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol,"" one of the best action adventures of the year if you're willing to suspend your disbelief for most of the picture.

In Hollywood, there is an unfortunate tradition that sequels, continuations, and follow-ups are amost never as good as their progenitors.  Oh, I know we all have our personal exceptions, like maybe ""From Russia with Love,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""The Godfather II,"" or ""Die Hard 4.""  But mostly sequels and their like have been disappointments.  Not so with the ""Mission: Impossible"" series.  The first movie I positively hated when I saw it, given that I am an old fan of the television show and despised what first movie did to the characters; it took me years to accept it.  The second ""M:I"" movie was marginally better, but then, anything would have been better to me than the first.  The third movie I liked quite a lot, and this 2011 installment is the best of the bunch, a humdinger of an action film.  Remarkable:  a series that is getting better as it goes along.

Tom Cruise is back again, of course, because what would these things be without him and his special brand of derring-do?  Only this time, things are more far-out than ever, which is why I recommend suspending your disbelief.  If you thought the stunts were incredible in the previous ""M:I"" pictures, they're stretched to the limit here.  Yet I found nothing in the movie I couldn't go along with; there were no ""Oh, that's just stupid"" moments, no matter how far-fetched the action.  That's the biggest compliment I can give the film.  What's more, Cruise did his own stunts.  At nearly fifty, the guy remains fit, and it's a kick to see him dangling off the world's tallest building (the Burj Kalifa in downtown Dubai), swinging from window to window.  And we can believe he's really doing it because, well, he's really doing it.  An accompanying featurette shows him about a thousand feet in the air, suspended with cables, naturally, which the filmmakers later digitally erased.  Still....

You don't really need to know or even follow the plot of the movie to enjoy it; it's one of those plots that's so complicated, so episodic, so convoluted, that to try to follow it just detracts from the film's atmosphere and adventure.  Let it suffice to know that it's all about launch codes and satellites and people who want to start World War III, the main characters globe-trotting from Russia to the United Arab Emirates to India in the fashion of all good action movies, the story borrowing scenes from the best of them.  For instance, the film opens with a scene from ""The Sting,"" followed by ones from ""Get Smart,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Fugitive,"" the ""Bourne"" adventures, and a penultimate sequence from both ""Goldfinger"" and ""Monsters, Inc.""

The narrative involves Cruise as Ethan Hunt and his IMF team breaking into the Kremlin, the plan going awry, the U.S. government disavowing the whole crew, and Hunt and his team having to find the baddies by themselves to prove their innocence.  Did I say they borrowed from other good thrillers?  How about roughly every Hitchcock film you can think of, starting with ""The 39 Steps""?  There's even a character in ""M:I - 4"" named ""Hanaway,"" pretty close to Hitchcock's ""Hannay.""

Brad Bird makes his feature-length live-action debut as director of the movie after success in the animation field with ""The Iron Giant,"" ""The Incredibles,"" and ""Ratatouille.""  As you might guess, this one most closely resembles ""The Incredibles,"" the live characters only slightly more realistic (at least in appearance).  Simon Pegg is back as Benji Dunn, the techie expert who heretofore had confined himself to the lab.  Now, he's passed his field exam so he can go out into the world and perform his technical magic.  Pegg is always a pleasant and amusing addition to any cast.  Also aboard the new IMF team is Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, a National Security analyst who gets sort of sideswiped into the crew.  Renner is no stranger to action movies as he also starred in 2008's ""The Hurt Locker,"" played supporting roles in 2010's ""The Town"" and 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and stars in 2012's ""The Bourne Legacy.""  The fourth member of Hunt's team is Paula Patton as Jane Carter, a sultry, do-it-all, kick-ass heroine.

I might add that anyone who doesn't like heights, like me, will find parts of ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" nerve-wracking.  In addition, there's more old-fashioned 007 gadgetry this time around, including a prototype BMW right out of any Bond movie.  And having Renner aboard is like having Bond and Bourne in the same film.  Did I say I liked it?

Video:
The picture quality on this film is about as good as it gets in a live-action feature.  The director shot some thirty minutes of the movie in IMAX (1.44:1), but he chose here to frame the entire film in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio, just as he did with the regular 35mm release in non-IMAX theaters, rather than going with a varying aspect ratio such as used in ""The Dark Knight.""  Whether you agree with his decision is another matter.  Paramount employ a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC encode to reproduce the film on high-definition Blu-ray.

Definition and detailing are almost perfect, especially in the scenes shot in 65mm IMAX, which are quite breathtaking in their clarity.  In fact, even though the regular footage is excellent, it looks by comparison a tad soft.  Just as important, colors, especially all-important facial tones, are natural and lifelike, with deep, inky black levels.  Film grain is practically nonexistent, but the fine, inherent print grain we do get provides a realistic texture.  The PQ on the Blu-ray disc is actually sharper and clearer than I remember it from a movie theater.

If there are any flaws in the video quality, you have to look really hard for them.  There is the comparative softness I mentioned above, hardly a flaw.  There is a little, very little, nearly undetectable flutter and wavering in a few rows of parallel lines.  And there are faint, narrow strips of vertical fade, perhaps banding, on the outer edges of the sandstorm sequence.  None of it is anything of concern.

Audio:
Using lossless 7.1 Dolby TrueHD to reproduce the sound, the Paramount audio engineers provide a sonic experience to equal or surpass the picture quality.  Needless to say, with 7.1 channels active, if you have the necessary audio setup, you get noises coming at you from all directions, and everywhere in between.  The highs sound reasonably well extended, the bass sounds taut, and the midrange sounds truthful.  On occasion, the dynamic impact will jolt you from your seat (yes, Virginia, things explode).  More important, the entire sound spectrum appears well balanced, meaning you don't get music overpowering dialogue or explosions that force you to turn down the volume.

Extras:
This ""Limited Edition"" three-disc set contains just about everything you can think of.  Disc one, a Blu-ray, contains the feature film in high definition; twenty scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; English audio descriptions; and English captions for the hearing impaired.  There are no other extras on disc one.

Disc two, also a Blu-ray, contains the bonus materials, mostly in HD.  First up is a series of featurettes called ""Mission Accepted,"" which includes ""Suiting Up in Prague,"" ""Heating Up in Dubai,"" and ""Vancouver Fisticuffs.""  They total about forty-eight minutes and give you behind-the-scenes looks at the special effects.  Next is another series of featurettes, this one called ""Impossible Missions,"" which includes ""The Russian Prison,"" ""Shooting in IMAX,"" ""Art Department,"" ""A Roll of Film,"" ""Life Masks,"" ""Stepping into the Storm,"" ""The Sandstorm,"" ""Dubai Car Crash,"" ""Lens on the Burj,"" ""Props,"" and ""Composer""  These total about fifty-one minutes and give you more behind-the-scenes looks at things.  Then, there are eight deleted scenes totaling about fifteen minutes, with optional director commentary; and two widescreen theatrical trailers.

Disc three contains the feature film on DVD.  Also, the package includes download codes for an UltraViolet and Digital Copy, the codes expiring April 17, 2013.  The three discs come in a solid Blu-ray keep case (none of that Eco stuff), further enclosed in a handsomely embossed light-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:
It's always nice to see things that are getting better with time instead of the other way around.  With ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" you get a first-class, slam-bang action adventure in absolute state-of-the-art picture and sound.  And you don't have to apologize for enjoying it.  To make matters even more welcome, there is every indication at the end of the movie that the IMF team will be back for more.  Let's hope they keep up the pattern of making every installment better than the last.",1434153600,,9113,5.021319120586276

4344494,3,B004EPYZUS,"A fun, competent, fairly forgettable thriller. Unlike the Bourne movies, after it was over, I didn't think about it again until I got the ""how many stars"" email. Which is not to say there wasn't any meat on the bones: it seemed like all the leaping they did--through skyscraper windows, down turbine shafts--could have been a metaphor for the ""leap of faith"" various characters had to take to believe in each other and themselves. (Yes, I'm probably overthinking it, but Brad Bird is a canny and visually literate director who would do that kind of thing.)

Still, if there were anything more to it than just good fun, it didn't really come through: the warm-hearted team meeting at the end of the movie felt weightless and obligatory. It's interesting that the silent scene with the wife much more affecting, even though it was only set up by dialog--no flying leaps, effects, or gunfire to tell her story, just things characters had said. Yet it carried more emotion than the rest of the movie.",1432944000,,996,4.757225433526012

No salt or butter, just dry....",1432684800,,281,4.072727272727272
4344549,5,B004EPYZUS,"Yes, there is a place in this world for mindless action flicks.  No, I don't think they deserve to win awards, but they can be lots of fun.  While I've felt the Mission: Impossible movies didn't start out well, I enjoyed the last one and knew I had to see Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.  It might be my favorite one yet.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Jane Carter (Paula Patton) have been tasked with stopping a rogue man who wants to start a nuclear war betweenRussiaand theUS.  But when their first attempts at gathering info ends in disaster, the entire IMF is shut down and they must strike out on their own to stop the villain and clear themselves and their agency.  Can they do it?

Look, if you are coming to this movie expecting anything other than intense action scenes, don't even bother.  The plot is just an excuse for the action.  Now don't misunderstand, the plot actually does hold together reasonably well.  There seemed to be a plot hole in a part or two, but they were small enough that it really wasn't an issue for me at all.  Every so often, the logical part of my brain would chime in with, ""This could never happen,"" but I'd quickly shut it up.

And why is that?  Because I was having so much fun.  The action scenes are frequent and really get your blood bumping.  And they keep throwing things in the hero's path that make it that much more fun.  I'm sure there were lots of special effects involved in the stunts and gun fights, but I couldn't tell.  All I knew was my hands and feet were getting sweaty way too often wondering how the characters would survive.  And I was loving every second of it.

The characters?  Well, besides Ethan, Benji was around for at least the last movie.  Ethan seems to know Jane and some other people we run into, but I sure didn't remember them.  Frankly, that doesn't matter because this is a movie about the action and the characters are just there to do the impossible.  Yes, there are some attempts at characters development, and it worked enough to make me care about the outcome, but really they could be anyone.

Which means that the big thing the actors had to do was action (if they didn't pass it off to stunt doubles) and deliver bits of exposition convincingly.  Now if this sounds like I am knocking the actors, I'm not.  But let's be honest, the demands on them wasn't that big.  The entire cast delivers what the script calls for, and I wasn't bothered by a minute of the acting.

I realize this review sounds like I am criticizing the film, when that's not true.  I loved it.  I'm just being realistic about it.  Most of my critics would apply any film of the action genre.  The genre only has one purpose - suspenseful actions scenes, and I think you'll find some of the best here.

So if you want an adrenalin boost, go see Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.  It's not great cinema, but it's a heart pumping good time.",1432512000,,2943,4.408921933085502

4345419,2,B004EPYZUS,"First, a technical gripe: The only English soundtrack on the Blu-ray disk is 7.1 true HD which our ten year old brilliant AV amp. could not interpret so it defaulted to ProLogic II - Grrr. Every other Blu-ray disk we've played has been decoded as DTS which is splendid so I sincerely hope that this is not a sign of things to come. This feature was so annoying that we watched the DVD version instead which gave us good old Dolby Digital 5.1 sound. UPDATE : Having encountered the same problem with another Blu-ray disk I tinkered about with the audio settings on the player (changing from `DTS re-encode' to `primary pass-through') whereupon the amp gave us DTS - Splendid! Apologies to Paramount...

Now, to the film. All of the MI films so far have been a more than a little tongue-in-cheek but they have delivered all-out action at a relentless pace within a taut plot; it doesn't usually do to think too much and the gadgets are universally silly but the films are always hugely entertaining. This film, however, despite the inclusion of J.J. Abrams in the production (but, significantly, not direction) credits is a serious let-down. There are lots of excellent action set-pieces and stunts/CGI (not that you can really tell the difference these days) but the plot is so linear and weak that it completely fails to provide the essential cohesion between the action sequences. The script is similarly lack-lustre, Tom looks tired & bored much of the time and Simon Pegg as the geeky side-kick is a total failure; he made a good `young Scotty' in the excellent Star Trek prequel but his brand of child-like pratishness is completely wrong for a major role in an action movie. These failings and the bizarre choice of a director best known for cartoons make for a sad & dismal end (hopefully) to the MI franchise.",1421280000,,1816,4.728706624605678

4346679,5,B004EPYZUS,"Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol is the fourth installment in the Mission: Impossible series. It stars Tom Cruise, who reprises his role of IMF Agent Ethan Hunt.

The IMF is shut down and has been disavowed. It was implicated in a global terrorist bombing. Ghost Protocol is initiated and Ethan Hunt and his new time must go to find the terrorists who are truly responsible to clear their organization's name. Added to that,they must also prevent a possible nuclear war as deactivation codes of nuclear weapons are going into the hands of terrorists who intend to put the world into global war. Ethan Hunt and his team does not find anything more impossible than a mission like this.

This is definitely the best Mission Impossible movie of the franchise that Tom Cruise has been involved with. It was stylish,fast-paced and loaded with gripping set pieces. Added to that,it also has great action scenes like no other that the viewers will surely enjoy. This big-budget action picture is definitely one to provide lots of enjoyment and entertainment. Finally,one will definitely look forward to Mission Impossible 5,which Cruise is currently shooting somewhere in the U.K.",1411948800,,1174,5.109375

4346804,4,B004EPYZUS,"This PG-13 money-printing franchise is back again. Do you know why? Because Producers J.J. Abrams and Tom Cruise are two smart fellows with a lot of clout who look for: a great director; a great script; and a great cast.

The great director is Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"") who is directing his first non-animated feature. The stunts are so hair raising it might have been easier on my nerves if they HAD been animated! Particularly scaling that skyscraper in Dubai... Whew!

The great script by television scriptwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andr Nemec, starts in Budapest where the IMF is implicated in a bombing. This means our doughty team must first clear their names. That takes them to Moscow where they learn there is also the threat of nuclear war.... So off to Mumbai... Oh, you know. Cruise is an international star and his movies always take us all over the world. That's part of the fun.

And here is a small part of that great cast:
  * Tom Cruise (""Valkyrie"") continues to be an enigma to me. For such a high-profile celebrity, I don't really know much about him. He gives each movie everything he's got and we always get our money's worth.
  * Tom Wilkinson (""The Debt"") is a highly capable actor who works all the time in a variety of accents. This is an A-List Actor (capital ""A"") who hasn't a shred of scandal associated with his name.
  * Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") is a great example of an actor who conveys energy, intelligence and subtext. He ain't purdy, but he's effective. I hope he becomes a permanent member of the IMF team: he brings both gravitas and humanity.
  * Paula Patton (""Precious"") surprised me as an action star. Who knew?
  * Simon Pegg (""Star Trek"") is hilarious! He never disappoints me; he is so perfect here I hope to see him bring this character back a third time in the inevitable next episode.
  * Ving Rhames (""Mission Impossible"" franchise) made a cameo appearance and an affectionate murmur swept the audience.
  * Anil Kapoor (""Slumdog Millionaire"") can play smarmy very nicely. Remember him as the M.C. in Slumdog?
  * Michael Nyqvist (""The Millennium Trilogy"") is an experienced multi-lingual Swede who is equally comfortable in heroic or villainous roles.

You may have noticed I haven't discussed the role each actor plays in the plot. Come on... In a Tom Cruise movie is a plot important? As you might expect, there is never a dull moment. Fans know they can rely on a Cruise movie for non-stop action and breath-taking stunts. But a plot? Not so much. All I can say is that we had tons of fun watching this action fest and appreciated some poignant moments as well.

Gunshots, vehicular mayhem, brawls, riots, and blowie uppie stuff, no profanity and they all kept their clothes on. This one should be a big hit.",1410912000,,2774,4.678350515463918

4347007,4,B004EPYZUS,"Quite fun, with some very impressive, if improbable action sequences. It's been a while since
I saw a climatic fight sequence go on so long and yet never get boring.

It's a popcorn movie to be sure. The few brief attempts at emotional depth and back-story are
probably the least successful element. The over-all plot feels like a leftover from a 1980's
James Bond film. And it's not a film I can imagine the need to go back to and re-see. I
don't think there are extra layers to be uncovered, and the very nifty stunt and CGI work can't
have the same rush of adrenaline the second time around.

But the action is deftly handled, the tension level high, the images are cool, and I got
caught up in spite of myself. At least in a moment to moment way. As long as I didn't
start up my bad habit of thinking about the 'big picture'.

And I'll be honest, I'm not a 'summer blockbuster action movie' kinda guy. I'm old compared
to the key audience this is aimed at. I'm more at home with the new Woody Allen movie or
some indie drama. So take this review with the appropriate grain of salt. But that said, I
can't deny I had a good time, and smiled lot.",1409184000,,1148,4.232876712328767

I thought this one was going to be bad because I heard it was boring and didn't have much of a story to it, but that was completely false.  The storyline is very good and seeing the cool gadgets in this one is also pretty cool to see.

With Tom Cruise, a favorite of mine -- He was eye candy from day one of his career but as he's grown older he not only looks good but performs as well.

However, that being said, he really is an intense actor and has made the MI series really pop in cinema.

This is the type of movie that needs to be seen a few times to get everyone and everything happening straight.  SO MUCH was going on I had a hard time keeping clear with the movie.  I am glad I purchased the movie, will watch it again to catch all the stuff I missed the first time going in.

By the way, is this the last MI type movie coming out?  Tom Cruise isn't old by any stretch, but the beatings he takes and the stunts, like the endless running sequences or the building climbing scene just seem to be more than even Ethan Hunt could manage at this stage of the game.

4348594,5,B004EPYZUS,"I don't care how much you disagree with his personal life, Tom Cruise is an excellent actor. He brings an intensity to every role that draws you at black hole force. Ghost Protocol was well written and directed. Paula Patton proved she was capable of playing more than just a pretty face. Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg put it down for the team, also. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1397606400,,382,4.550724637681159

4348596,1,B004EPYZUS,This was our second try to get this movie and in both cases it stopped streaming at about the same place - 1/3 of the way through.  It then restarted itself and we had to fast forward to where we stopped seeing the moving.  This happened about 4 times and we have yet to get to the end without this happening.  Our internet speed is quite fast and we do not have this problem with any other viewing.,1397520000,,399,4.089743589743589

4348599,4,B004EPYZUS,Love Cruise when it comes to none stop action and high tech gadets this movie does not let you down. Agent Hunt's mission is to clear the IMF. I stayed on the edge of my seat through the entire movie who wouldn't while Cruise hangs from the tallest building in the world.,1397088000,,271,4.230769230769231
4348680,4,B004EPYZUS,"Definitely different feel from previous MI films and a welcomed change.  Doesn't take itself too seriously and ironically becomes more believable then previous series films by being lightheartedly self-aware.  All the characters were believable, the chemistry between them worked and I enjoyed the extra does of occasional humor.  All those improvements were delivered without sacrificing the intense action and great location showcasing cinematography that we rightfully expect from these type of films.

Unfortunately, the technicalities of the proposed gadgets and plot elements are laughingly corny for those viewers who have even the slightest clue how technology and the real world actually work, but that is no different then all previous MI films and, in my opinion, is the sole remaining series weakness not resolved by this installment.  If we could just get this type of MI film to adopt James Bond style realism in those areas, you would have the perfect spy action flick.",1397088000,,984,5.363636363636363

4348688,5,B004EPYZUS,"Despite my dislike of Tom Cruise, he did a fine job as co-producer of this film. It is very entertaining and the visuals and stunts are quite good, if unbelievable at times. It follows the tradition of nonstop excitement in great locations with dastardly criminals and the good guys winning in the end, even though some don't make it.",1396483200,,334,4.677966101694915

4348889,5,B004EPYZUS,"Indeed, this is very high octane movie, and it won't let you down if you liked Mission Impossible III. Infact, I can't wait until they produce the next sequel.",1395187200,,159,4.517241379310345

4348891,3,B004EPYZUS,"***SPOILER WARNING***  I liked the underlying plot device that the entire team has been not only disavowed and abandoned but identified as global terrorists (in Russia no less), and are the only ones who can prevent nuclear annihilation armed only with their wits. This quickly falls by the wayside as they rendezvous at a secret mobile cache of everything-you-could-possibly-want-for-this-mission, and Tom C. convinces everyone (including the shady new guy) to pursue an incredibly convoluted scheme to correct their mistakes and save the world.  Watching the iconic towers of the Kremlin explode early on is almost worth the rental price, but it goes downhill fast from there.",1395014400,,678,5.386792452830188

4348894,4,B004EPYZUS,"Okay, the main thing you have to know is that going into this movie you have to suspend belief at the impossible action scenes, and the oddly coincidental things that pop up conveniently to move the action along.  Once you do that, and just go with the flow, it's a pretty good movie for what it is.  It moves so fast that at times it's confusing, but some of the things you can see coming, such as what will inevitably happen in a movie like this when you suddenly find yourself in Dubai, home of the world's tallest building.  Still, it was fun to watch, and it's wall-to-wall action from start to finish.  For story, idea, acting, and special effects, I would give it 5 stars; for the confusing scenes (I'm not stupid and I was confused at times, so I think a lot of others will be, too), coincidental plot aids and impossible action scenes I would give it 2 stars.  This rounds out to about 4 overall.",1394928000,,905,4.331360946745562

4348896,3,B004EPYZUS,I enjoyed it but it just went on a little too long. The action was great and I think there was clear hero and villain.  But it could have been wrapped up in about an hour.,1394755200,,171,3.75

4348948,5,B004EPYZUS,"What can be said other than Tom Cruise knows how to make a movie - WELL.  The way this movie carefully combines wit and adventure, but never compromises the ever-intriguing plot is seamless.  This is a very well done movie that anyone who appreciates good movies well LOVE.",1394582400,,273,4.666666666666667
4348949,4,B004EPYZUS,Tom Cruise in the mission impossible gig. Well done and better than the tv show ever was. Check it out.,1394582400,,103,4.2

4348951,4,B004EPYZUS,"Like the James Bond flicks these Mission Impossible films are best thought of as travel films with lots of fast cartoon action.  This one fits the bill and is a lot of fun.  It also has some character and emotional development that is not up to Le Carre standards, but make the film a little more enjoyable as you do care about the protagonists.",1394409600,,345,4.375
4348952,5,B004EPYZUS,"Non-stop breath taking action.
I had to watch the movie in stages; I couldn't stand all those problems
at once.
It followed the original Mission Impossible way, with so many intricate
gadgets.

4348955,5,B004EPYZUS,"I'd pretty much gotten over the whole MIP thing, but I saw Tom Cruise on the Late Show being interviewed about the stunt he did on the Dubai Tower and absolutely had to see it.

They did one better this time. Not only was this every bit as good as the others, but somehow they added comedy to it without loosing any intensity.  I love that they did that!  And thank you Cruise for continuing to push the limits of your stunts. This was priceless.",1394150400,,446,4.223529411764706

4349123,3,B004EPYZUS,There were a couple of good scenes and some that were a little too far fetched. Overall I have to give the movie 3 stars. It kept with the Mission Impossible story line but it was very predictable unlike the previous MI.,1393372800,,220,4.261904761904762

4349256,4,B004EPYZUS,A bit more of a human view of Ethan Hunt which adds some comedy to the action.  The best MI to date.,1393372800,,100,3.5454545454545454
4349257,4,B004EPYZUS,Didn't move from my seat the entire time the movie was playing. I loved it. It was a very good movie,1393372800,,100,3.8095238095238093
4349258,5,B004EPYZUS,"Ghost Protocol was pretty good. It lives up the the other Mission Impossible movies - lots of action, dangerous situations, death-defying climb up the outside of the tallest building in the world, lots of technology, and a few laughs. I was not disappointed.",1393286400,,258,5.023255813953488

4349260,3,B004EPYZUS,I'd rate this a 2.5. This movie does not take itself seriously. So if you don't it will be an ok way to spend a day trappped inside by the snow.,1393113600,,144,3.6774193548387095
4349261,5,B004EPYZUS,"This has to be my favorite of the Mission Impossible series, much action and great places being shot at. Tom and his fellow actors did an outstanding job with this one...the movies just get better and better with each one.",1393027200,,222,4.575
4349262,5,B004EPYZUS,I really like Tom Cruise as an actor.  He is so believable in his roles and gives a non stop performance in this movie.  I have enjoyed the Mission Impossible TV series - from its beginning in the mid 60s and each of the movies that renewed that theme  have been great!,1393027200,,269,4.134615384615385
4349263,5,B004EPYZUS,Action packed with a good story line! Another movie Tom Cruise is on his game! Highly recommend watching this movie.,1392940800,,116,4.85

4349265,3,B004EPYZUS,This was an OK movie in the Mission Impossible saga. It lacked anything new or different to really make you want to watch it again,1392854400,,130,4.24
4349406,4,B004EPYZUS,"The best Mission Impossible movie yet, very cool stunts, great supporting cast, and Tom Cruise was not so annoying. I'm surprised that I want to see more of these movies, but after this one I'd be happy to.",1392768000,,206,4.447368421052632
4349407,4,B004EPYZUS,"A bit confusing once you jump into the story, but all is answered at the end. The movie does not deviate far from the standard action movie, but still delivers solid entertainment.",1392681600,,180,4.65625
4349408,1,B004EPYZUS,It went on forever. The chase and fight scenes went on too long.  The Mission Impossible series has run its course.,1392681600,2,115,4.476190476190476
4349409,5,B004EPYZUS,"Great movie.  Balanced action, suspense and a little bit of romance.  Tom cruise at his best!  One of those movies you watch over and over.",1392681600,,139,4.48
4349410,3,B004EPYZUS,"This installment of the MI franchise was extremely average.  The action and scenery were fine, the characters were forgettable.  In particular the ""bad guy"" selection was quite bland.  I saw the movie three days ago and can't remember anything much about them or their generic plot.  The new team members were also disappointing.  Quality actors but no real chemistry to speak of.  The attempts at humor were corny.

I don't understand the high ratings I see for this movie and I strongly suspect industry shills / manipulation.

This isn't a bad movie, just very very so-so.",1392595200,,575,4.916666666666667
4349411,3,B004EPYZUS,"We'd give this Tom Cruise flic 4 stars for action and technology-laden gadgets and tricks. The plot alternated between hard to find and obvious, and in both cases rated no better than 2 stars. The ending felt more like we were watching a TV series than a movie which ought to have a clearly defined beginning and end! Yes - definitely set up for a sequel, but the back-story to THAT character was totally murky. In spite of these short comings, it was fun to watch - good for a cold winter evening.",1392595200,,498,4.365591397849462
4349412,3,B004EPYZUS,Just a few too many impossible stunts. Entertaining and Tom looks really buff. Jeremy Renner was a nice touch to the movie.,1392595200,,123,4.636363636363637
4349413,3,B004EPYZUS,"If the best endorsement I can give for a movie is: it was alright than that seems less than sterling acclaim. Ive seen all the movies in this series and the only one that had a real storyline with twists and turns was the first, and maybe the second, but I don't recall it well. They just weren't that memorable. The enjoyable part of a movie like this is you know exactly what to expect: impossible action sequences, new spy gadgets, and lots of fighting. I find Tom Cruise less likeable than when hes younger so Im a bit biased but he seems a bit long in the tooth to hang from buildings and get smacked in the face by steel to bounce back and kick ass, but thats just me. Anyway storyline in a nutshell: dangerous terrorist named Hendricks got some russian nuclear launch codes and Ethan must stop him before he starts WWIII. It keeps you entertained in a mindless way but its neither serious or good, just watchable.",1392595200,,920,4.385964912280702
4349414,5,B004EPYZUS,"It'd been a while since I've seen any of the MI movies.  I didn't realize what I've been missing.

4349489,3,B004EPYZUS,"This movie was OK, some good visuals, some exciting moments, but scripting was marginal, the threads holding the story together were not compelling or even believable, and it tended to take itself too seriously for such a shallow and predictable plot.",1392422400,,251,5.146341463414634

4349492,2,B004EPYZUS,"The scene in Dubai is great, other than that, the plot has more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese.  The TV series never took itself too seriously. This movie thinks it's a John le Carre knock off.  It doesn't suceed.",1392163200,,223,4.162790697674419

4349494,5,B004EPYZUS,"I can honestly say that most movies are a letdown after the first one.  But NOT Mission Impossible.

4349631,3,B004EPYZUS,"I like it.  Not their best installment.  It felt forced at times, but still entertaining.  I read somewhere if you play the movie backwards the secrets of Scientology are revealed and the location of the mother ship is made known.  It's a ghost ship....wait Ghost Protocol.  See I knew I was on to something, take that wife and kids who shake their head when I listen to the radio with it unplugged.",1391385600,,399,4.486111111111111

It brings the story and characters of Mission Impossible further into the twenty-first century but does not descend into big, dumb action movie shlock. It's a faithful MI installment. The espionage, intrigue, and journey across the world to save it from auto-destruction is all there. It is light on characters and emotional investment, which the movie makes up for in plot and interesting set pieces and locations. A very good movie if you're into spy movies.",1391385600,,514,4.988372093023256

I enjoy the fact that they combine amazing stunts and action sequences with enough humor and a few human mistakes to keep the stories a little believable. We all know we could never do the things they get away with physically and (legally?), but that's what makes them fun to watch. Looking forward to MI 5 in 2015!",1391299200,,375,4.529411764705882

4349710,5,B004EPYZUS,"They stick true to the title in exciting fashion!  Of course the stuff they do is impossible - but they make it look like that with incredible courage, physical ability - that it could be done.  Of course the stakes are impossibly high (fate of the world), and of course the mission is impossibly difficult and complicated, and the action is impossibly exciting.  I loved it, I was riveted to the movie from beginning to end.  Get this one!",1390953600,,440,4.531645569620253

Maybe....why would they pick him as that character??? Anyway, the MI series is well done and worthy of mental occupation for 120 minutes or so....Enjoy!",1390521600,,465,5.131578947368421

4349779,5,B004EPYZUS,This is by far to me the best of the series. The first one will always be a classic and 3 was also pretty good but I think this one tops them all. The crew that is put together works really well. Miss not having Ving in this one but the crew they have worked well enough for me to forget. Brad Bird did a good job directing,1390348800,,323,3.764705882352941

I like seeing the agents in action ""stripped"" of some of their high tech gear and having to make do ""without masks"". I know awesome technology is a signature of the series, but this just feels urgent and gritty, like the world is actually in danger! A total winner of an evening in my book!",1389744000,,464,4.470588235294118

4350064,4,B004EPYZUS,Not being at T. Cruise fan - and having thoroughly enjoyed the original MI TV series - I had intentionally avoided the MI movies.  Took a chance with this one on Amazon Prime and was surprised how full of action and humor it is.  Very good - very entertaining.,1389657600,,260,4.285714285714286

4350213,5,B004EPYZUS,This was one of my favorite MI movies done. I did not know that Tom Cruise was an executive producer on this film. That's a good thing since it gives him the opportunity to give major input to the film. I don't think allot people realize that he does many of his own stunts. Keep this in mind when watching MI-2 and 3. Recommend a must see.,1389139200,,340,4.08955223880597

4350421,4,B004EPYZUS,"I am a collector, so to complete this title is a good thing.  This closed all the arcs from the first three films and closes the storyline.

Tom Cruise. However, I gotta give it to him, nobody has more of an intense look than Cruise, and I found myself really enjoying this

movie in spite of my bonding with Katie Holmes. Tom, you are truly committed to a role once you get going, and I find that refreshing.

4350505,4,B004EPYZUS,This was a lot of fun. It fell into the same line as the others in the MI series. It was a lot of action and some confusion as to who is who. But the characters were funny and intense appropriately and the plot was exciting.,1387065600,,224,3.891304347826087

So, if your idea of a good movie contains a helicopter somehow remaining stable in flight behind a bullet train in a tunnel and someone taking a mask off their face off every couple of minutes, then this movie will most likely be a disappointment. I hated Face Off - passionately hated it. So if you liked that movie go see Mission Impossible II first. Here's my Mission Impossible list  - favorite one at the top and least favorite at the bottom:

4351399,3,B004EPYZUS,"*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***

Overall, the movie was just disappointing. There were a lot of bad little things that left me wanting more. A signature of the MI series are cool gadgets that actually work. Most of the gadgets in this movie must have been from Walmart because most end up breaking or not working right. Let's count shall we? Awesome glass gloves...busted. Magnetic cart thing...nope. Mask making machine...sorry. Hallway projector screen...can't handle more than one set of eyes. Camera contacts...great until you want to blink. Fake IDs...please wait, uploading.  Smartphone assassination warning...oops, too late. Come on! These gadgets are supposed to be awesome and work! One of the few things that did work was a balloon that was magically maneuverable...don't ask me how.

Most of the time our good guys are bungling their way through some sort of mashed up mission. Originality is gone because our bad guy is literally an evil genius...really? Yet for some reason he decides to hobble off a parking garage falling to his death when all he needed to do was toss the ""nuclear football"" case over the edge. Speaking of nuclear. Why not just contact the Russian government and tell them their nuclear codes have been compromised? Even if they don't take it seriously how hard is it to change the codes, you know, just in case? Done. Evil genius defeated! Lastly the movie was very slow for an action movie. I understand it can't be all action for 2 hours but the sequences in between were painful. I get it, they're a rag tag team all alone but it didn't quite work for me.",1381190400,,1587,4.827205882352941

It was funny, entertaining and actors were just right. The acting for quite good and even when the Americans were speaking Russian, it was nearly completely good. There were very few moments when the speech weas nearly unrecognizable but it wasn't the same like in other Hollywood movies where  it was so awful. This movie definitely deserves 5 stars because it was so completely different. It's like whoever made made the movie, actually cared for it and hence the outcome. Great movie.

This the last are my favorite, stunning stunts in this also WOW!",1380153600,,121,5.1
4351635,4,B004EPYZUS,"In this high flying, action packed, secret agent movie, character Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) preforms acrobatic stunts and one intense fight scene after another. This surprisingly well directed film is not only loaded with an insane amount of action, but is also deeply intricate and will require the audience to think. Brad Bird and the writers also did an astounding job by keeping this film interesting by adding many twists and turns. The only downfall is that the movie drags on a little and seems long at times.

The main plot point, or ""impossible mission"", of the movie was that a disemboweled team of IMF agents had to clear their name by stopping Hendricks from launching a missile thus creating a nuclear war and ""ending the world."" The mission pans out to be a long extensive one with twists and turns leading up to the big finale.

 The surprising fact about the director, Brad Bird, is that this was his first real life action movie. Most of his early works that he was known for were all animated, such as; The Simpsons (1989), The Iron Giant (1999), The Incredibles (2004), and Ratatouille (2007). From the list of these works, you would not expect him to have been able to direct an action movie of this caliber.

The movie's action kicks off with a bang in the second scene with Hunt escaping from a Russian prison, fighting all the inmates and guards to find his Russian intel man and get out. Hunt throws inmates from ledges and makes the guards look like fools with his acrobatic and superior fighting skills. From then on, it's one high-tech action scene after another. Like the ""Gecko"" gloves that allow agent Hunt to climb on the windows of the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world), which makes for a fantastic gut-wrenching scene.

What makes this movie intricate and sometimes difficult to understand is all of the different characters and how they disguise themselves and pretend to be different people on and off again. Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), the crazy nuclear extremist, seems to be everywhere and is even disguised perfectly as his assistant during the biggest chase scene of the film.

This is one thrilling, action packed movie that should appeal to a wide range of people. From the acting to the intricate storyline, this Mission: Impossible movie not only lives up to its predecessors, but may be the best one yet in this successful movie franchise. The series and this Mission: Impossible in particular are on a complete different level than any other action films to date and have almost created its own genre.",1380153600,,2561,4.795918367346939

4351637,4,B004EPYZUS,"Every entry in the Mission Impossible series has been unique and different from each other. In the fourth film they've dropped the number and added a cool subtitle. The way I see it Ethan Hunt has been created to be an American version of a James Bond with the gadgets (particularly in this one) mixed with a little Jason Bourne (even though the first MI came out before the first Bourne). I feel like I'm one of the last people out there who really likes Tom Cruise. I mean, how could you not like the guy? He's a fantastic actor, does his own stunts and never backs down from a challenge. The biggest problem I found in this film was the simplicity in the plot. I personally liked the 3rd film better, a few more twists and intense sequences, this one relied mostly on stunts.",1379808000,,778,4.372413793103449

4351780,4,B004EPYZUS,"Brad Bird builds on the direction JJ Abrams took the series with MI3 and produces an equally suspenseful, funny, engaging actioner. I wondered what sort of digital magic was used to make it look like Tom Cruise was climbing the tallest building in the world. Apparently very little, as Cruise actually filmed the scene on the building, suspended on cables that were digitally removed in post production. Ballsy. The best decision anyone ever made in this series is adding Simon Pegg to the cast.

Quibbles: Eventually someone will realize Jeremy Renner is a character actor and not a movie star. Besides, his role seems superfluous (""Hey, I know, let's cast the guy from The Hurt Locker!""), as does the subplot involving Ethan Hunt's wife from the previous film. My big quibble is the final fight between Cruise and the villain. It gives new meaning to ""over the top"" as the two battle it out in a high tech car park. My wife remarked it reminded her of Peter Griffin's fist fights with a giant rooster on 'Family Guy"".",1378771200,,1019,4.724719101123595

Same stunts, same desperation, same double cross, same angst.....there have been, in my opinion, very few sequels that kept the shine of the initial movie - most of the Lethal Weapon sequels were good, the Harry Potter sequels were all excellent and, a rarity, the third Twilight movie was actually BETTER than the first, but then if there had been a budget of more than $2.50 for that movie it could have been better......no wait, no it couldn't.  Anyway, if you are a Tom Cruise fan, can't get enough of the action movie genre and aren't a deep thinker (requisite for action movies) watch this one post haste.",1377734400,,731,4.651162790697675

4352275,4,B004EPYZUS,It was good. The main villain was not developed enough and Tom Cruise is focusing his career on becoming the new Bruce Willis but not as gritty. I've watched it twice and one of those times was while doing something else. It fills time but not a movie that compares to the original,1377561600,,281,4.320754716981132

4352464,5,B004EPYZUS,"First the philosophic basis for the film:

After giving his lifeblood to the United States, Ethan Hunt and his team are disavowed to avert
career disaster; invoking 'Ghost Protocol.'

Ghost Protocol is a standard 'Hunt for Red October' type of thriller. The other reviews have pretty much
given the movie away, so I will give three points.

1. Ethan Hunt is really an MI6 in this film.
2. The Mexican IMF agent is based on a real lady I know of.
3. The analyst is also an MI6, none other than James Bond.",1377043200,,504,4.397849462365591

4352576,4,B004EPYZUS,"The story had a decent premise. The hero was close to believable as a guy that is kind of superhuman when it comes to knowing what to do in impossible situations and somehow always being prepared. Prepared except when the plot point is that they/he are not prepared. The other characters were well played too. Enjoyable.
Some of the plot devices got tedious like the window missing from the poshest hotel in the world and not even housekeeping even noticed.
It was good I suppose but another thing that was weird was that the crew went from grim and distrustful in one scene  to jovial and wisecracking in the next.",1376784000,,615,4.590909090909091
4352577,4,B004EPYZUS,"What's really amazing about this movie are some of the stunts Tom Cruise performs-jumping off of 5 story building, climbing the tallest building in the world in Dubai at 100 stories and above.

4352695,4,B004EPYZUS,"A middle aged Tom Cruise leads his team in a bevy of stunts and trickery to victory in achieving a pleasant evening at the television set (in my case, watching a disc). As usual the challenge is to prevent some Mighty Bad things from happening (or  insuring some mighty good things do happen). Little time is wasted on lengthy explanations or jabber on love or marriage,  right or wrong, or any of that other 'claptrap' that slows down many a picture that would be better off without them. Its go to work and get the job done. Cruise is all that one could ask of him, the supporting cast do quite well with what is left for them to do before, during and after, Tom's achievements.

I liked it so much after the first viewing that I viewed it again several more times.  It's hard to understand why Cruise was willing to do those stunts.  I know I wouldn't have been willing no matter what the paycheck looked like.  But they made the movie so exciting, I was on the edge of my seat.  The scenes on the Burj Khalifa were only part of the movie, too; there were several changes of scene and different problems to be solved, so the film keeps you interested all the way through with just the right amount of tension.

4353142,4,B004EPYZUS,"In line with previous MI movies. Good plot, good characters, and plenty of suspenful action. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys action movies.",1374105600,,144,5.304347826086956
4353292,3,B004EPYZUS,Perhaps me but I think this series is over; at least with Cruise at the helm. Well filmed but tired,1374105600,,99,4.0
4353293,3,B004EPYZUS,"Your typical Mission Impossible movie, full of action and suspense.  Tom could probably continue playing this role for years to come, like Sean Connery in 007.",1374105600,,159,5.115384615384615
4353294,3,B004EPYZUS,"The basic plot was impossible!  Acting-- high school level! Camera angles-- great: Sound track --above average: Most of the actors did not get into character -- role presence was  at college level! wardrobe good: cinematic techniques above average regarding todays production values!  this is what I would have expected from an independent production house!
Giving three stars is a real gift!",1374019200,,392,5.39344262295082

4353297,5,B004EPYZUS,I will watch it. . I was so excited that I bought a 3d tv that I had to have any 3d dvd's and this was one of my only options. I have looked at it since just not really interested in watching it or anyother 3d movies. Funny how that worked. Had to have a 3d tv though. LOL,1373932800,,272,3.55
4353298,3,B004EPYZUS,Tom gets a bad rap. Maybe he's nutty otherwise but his acting is not bad in these kind of movies. He even does comedy fairly well.  I wasn't liking the attempt at comic relief as the original series was pretty serious business as I remember. That's why 3 stars instead of 4.  Plot wasn't bad either. Good chase sequences and nail biting fight scenes.  Good functional close quarters combat and not high flying kicks. I was entertained to be sure,1373760000,,445,4.5375

4353503,4,B004EPYZUS,"Fast moving......lots of action, stunts and improbabilities, which I like.

4353508,5,B004EPYZUS,"This might be my second favorite MI movie. Number one is still the first but this one was great with the comedy they threw in, and the devices breaking down all the time on them.

4353603,1,B004EPYZUS,Every sequel movie that uses the same concept as the original movie is worse than he original movie. This movie is no exception. And I did like the original movie and even the TV series.,1372896000,,186,4.3428571428571425

4353607,4,B004EPYZUS,At least as good as MI1. Certainly better than the mess that was MI2. Stronger theme and ending than MI3.  Worth a view.,1372723200,,120,4.217391304347826
4353608,4,B004EPYZUS,"After 3 movies I thought I would struggle to get through this movie, but the movie kept me entertained and I made through the whole film.  I would never watch these films in the theater but on video it is worth watching.",1372723200,,220,4.238095238095238

4353610,4,B004EPYZUS,"Well, it's Mission: Impossible. Of course there is plenty of action. Sometimes Cruises character seemed to be having a Nathan Drake (Uncharted) day, which brought the humor to the movie. I was able to watch this from the Amazon Prime app on the Panasonic LCD i bought at Christmas using Samsung active 3D glasses which made it much more entertaining. It turned out to be an Amazon-provided afternoon since all parts but the cable connection came from Amazon. Thanks, guys!",1372723200,,472,4.9125

4353719,4,B004EPYZUS,"I still believe that the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie was the best of the franchise, but ""Ghost Protocol"" was still worth watching. The fast-paced action that is a trademark of the ""M:I"" movies is there even if at times it's a bit beyond belief. But then again, isn't going to the movies a person's opportunity to suspend reality?",1372291200,,335,4.793103448275862

You can watch it maybe 2 time  to get some of the finer points and plots.  I was not impress with the female lead in the movie. Techie guy was funny and good and the guy who was assigned to protect Tom wife was good too.  The Bad guy is the kind  of villain that been done before and needs a real facelift and something new. Not this super crazy guy who keeps  showing up in all the MIF & 007 movies.  Something along the lines of Jaws or maybe super evil person like Red Skull,1371168000,,623,3.84251968503937

There were some interesting twists in it as well. I would recommend it to everyone who likes this movie genre; it was definitely entertaining. The only problem with it I had was the sound. I had my sound on the computer turned up to the fullest and still had problems hearing it. I might have put five stars if the sound had been better.",1370563200,,503,4.361702127659575

But it's so much fun to watch this wild action film, I really don't care. And watch is the key word, both Cruise and Patton are striking. It is cool to watch a woman kicking butt. The chases, fights and special effects are engaging. At one point I even gasped.

4354464,3,B004EPYZUS,"It's not that Tom Cruise is long in the tooth, it's not that you really really really have to suspend disbelief (and not all for the special effects), it's not that Ethan Hunt might very well be kin to Spider Man but this is about spies, not do-gooders. For me, it's that it never really gripped me the way earlier MIs have. I suppose if you are into the mindless stuff - special effects, technology, groovy cars and car chases, then you might like this, although there are probably dozens of other movies with these elements that don't require you to follow along as much. For me the story is not all that compelling. The characters are mostly one-dimensional and I don't really care who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Or girl.

4354547,2,B004EPYZUS,"Bummer!  I'd been looking forward to this movie (which was brought to me, happily, by the marriage of Amazon's Prime Instant Video and Roku, which totally rock as a duo), as I'd liked the first three.  However, this was a dreadful disappointment.  Perhaps I should have been forewarned by the fact that the ""Incredibles"" director, Brad Bird, was at the helm, but this was infantile.  I can't count the number of silly things completely wrong with this film.  Tom Cruise runs, as he always does.  His co-stars' dialogue seems to be comprised of what you'd hear in a 6th, or maybe 8th-grade, classroom.  There's lots of ""interpersonal drama,"" as if we all care.  The female costar, who is about Cruise-sized, so, 5'5"" or so, kicks a big bad guy's ass, in hand-to-hand combat; utterly unbelievable.  The only people who could find that scene believable are those who've never been hit.  Simon Pegg is the best thing about the film, and the only remotely natural character.  The other male lead, Jeremy Renner, is actually quite good and FAR more believable than Cruise at the tough-guy routine.  The plot holes are so large you could drive the BMW prototype car that other reviews rave about through them.

I'm all for great, silly action films.  I don't mind a lack of believability, generally, but I have to be able to suspend some level of disbelief.  ""Humorously"" bickering co-agents on a critical mission?  Puerile nonsense.  90lb. girl beating up a 220+ lb. guy?  More nonsense.  The  method of breaking into the Kremlin was absurd; Cruise picks a set of handcuff locks with a paperclip (man, is anyone EVER going to get tired of that old cliched device, ever?) and escapes from Russian cops (while being considered a TERRORISM suspect that killed boatloads of people); Russian cops find the ""Secretary's"" car--now, we're talking about a Cabinet-level US Representative, here--and open fire, killing many of the occupants.  Hunh?  Does anyone think that would ever really happen?  Renner's story as to why he's behind a desk is positively the stuff of silly soap operas, (think, ""Twilight"" type depth) and his purportedly heartbreaking ""I could never work in a life-or-death situation again"" should win a Razzie for worst dialogue.  I won't even get into the ridiculous magic climbing gloves for the world's tallest building, or the equally magic physics-busting building entrance.  OR the blown knee that works fine one scene later.  Whoever wrote the ""sandstorm"" scenes has never been in a sandstorm, either (yes, I have).  Overall, as I said, just...silliness personified.  A cartoon with live-action figures, about as engrossing and believable for grown-ups as Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner.  All it needed was the ubiquitous falling Anvil, hitting Cruise on the head (I wish), so he could get up, unhurt.  It would have been the perfect ending.",1369872000,4,2854,5.01063829787234

4355494,3,B004EPYZUS,"For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a `serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr&eacute; Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.

It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (L&eacute;a Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. Grady Harp, May 13",1368316800,,2767,4.656441717791411

4355499,5,B004EPYZUS,"This was a typical Tom Cruise adrenaline pumping extravaganza. Other than MI 3, I felt this was the better of the series! Regardless of Cruise's belief system, he is a great actor & one that I look forward to seeing again & again. I can think of only a couple of his movies that I wouldn't care to view again & this is one worth multiple viewings. The action begins almost from the start & continues for most of the movie.

4355622,2,B004EPYZUS,Ghost Protocol does not compare to the original. The plot and character development are lacking although there is not much more one can do to prolong a dying series. The special effects are good and the new gadgets are cool but that's about all this movie offers.,1367884800,,263,4.617021276595745
4355702,4,B004EPYZUS,My husband and I were very entertained as somehow it managed to rise above the usual thriller. I'm probably old fashioned but it was nice not to have it so peppered with the f--- word that you could hardly follow the dialogue.

4355704,4,B004EPYZUS,I didn't like the previous MI films. Thought they were just so so. But I enjoyed the hair raising stunts and Tom Cruise so intent and focused in this. The whole man with a personal mission worked for me. I'm one who has to weed through Tom's performances to find the gems.  I think this was one of his best 'fun' movies.,1367539200,,320,4.161290322580645

4355708,5,B004EPYZUS,Great movie! Love Tom Cruise in almost everything he does. There is so much action in this movie so it should appeal to all action junkies. The fact that Tom Cruise does most all his own stunts is amazing. I loved the location of this movie. There was so much great scenery. I'll more than likely never get to go to these locations so I found that all so interesting. You'll be on the edge of your seat and you  won't be bored. One of the best in the Mission Impossible series.,1367366400,,477,4.184782608695652

4355710,3,B004EPYZUS,"The movie is filled with great action scenes but they can go on too long and some were quite predictable. The story actually made sense but the ending went on far too long and it was rather ridiculous how close it came to going Boom! The CGI at the end was ludicrously phony looking compared to the rest of the movie. The fight sequences were excellent compared to previous MI movies where they were obviously phony.

4356585,5,B004EPYZUS,"This is one of those movies that someone can watch over and over and never get tired of it.  Ghost Protocol, in my opinion, is the best of the Mission:  Impossible films.  Watch it!",1365465600,,181,4.264705882352941
4356586,2,B004EPYZUS,"I like action films. Cruise has done some wonderful projects like Samurai, Eyes Wide Shut and Interview with a Vampire.  For me, this movie was like trashy comic book material, not a true thriller.  I turned it off aft er a few minutes.  Must give some credit for the technical work and big bucks.",1365465600,,297,4.462962962962963

4356659,5,B004EPYZUS,"The first Mission: Impossible had one of the most engaging story lines I've ever seen. While the story line of this film isn't as engaging, the acting and action in the film is fantastic. I love the climb up the building. The tech guy is hilarious in this movie.",1365379200,,262,4.36734693877551

4356663,5,B004EPYZUS,"I have been fan of all mission impossible series, since they were just TV series.  I have watched all the TV series and it's amazing to see how technology has advanced in the film business over time.  This one is also great, but the special effects were a little too phony and hard to believe.  This time there was lot of commercial for Apple products.  Overall, a great fun movie.",1365292800,,381,4.4
4356664,5,B004EPYZUS,"Good story. Another spy movie. Action-packed like ""James Bond"" movies, such as ""Golden Eye"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", or others like ""War of the Worlds"" etc.",1365292800,,155,5.24
4356665,5,B004EPYZUS,Great fast paced action / mystery / thriller. Action from the moment it starts to the end. Get all your snacks and get ready there are no breaks and nowhere you really want to pause the video. So just side back and enjoy it as it twist and turns from one MI task to the next.,1365206400,,275,3.9285714285714284
4356666,4,B004EPYZUS,"I'm not a professional movie critic, but I obviously enjoyed the movie or I wouldn't have ordered it.  More than likely you wouldn't be ordering it unless you liked it or similar movies.  I've had no problems with the product itself.",1365206400,,233,4.658536585365853
4356767,5,B004EPYZUS,"I really liked this.  Jeremy Renner is in it, too, and that was a two-fer.  Interesting gadgets and gizmos.  Another great M:I.  I am a TC fan...as an actor.  He never seems to disappoint.  Good entertainment and great locations.  Of course, the music always brings a modicum of excitement...like 007's theme.",1365033600,,309,4.9411764705882355

4356773,4,B004EPYZUS,"I've seen all the Mission Impossible movies and I always think that with the next release, the quality will fade like so many ""series"" movies. This movie however is not like that. Cruise brings a good story to the screen and even though there are a couple of slow spots the movie keeps you interested and I found myself saying out loud, ""this was a really good movie"" when it was over. I don't often do that.

It's a good action movie, not dominated by CGI, no mooshie sex, just a good action movie. I liked it and hope you do too.",1364860800,,531,4.205882352941177

4356776,5,B004EPYZUS,I loved Tom Cruise in this movie also. A lot of action and worth seeing. Suspense and action all in one movie.,1364774400,,110,4.045454545454546

4356897,5,B004EPYZUS,I am a fan of the previous Mission Impossible movies.  Each of the previous movies were very good.

4356900,4,B004EPYZUS,Outrageous action.  He's either superman or insane.  Didn't see the 'do not try this at home' warning.  Should be required.,1364601600,,123,5.05

4356947,4,B004EPYZUS,"Reminded me of lots of old detective TV-series where despite outwitting the cops and solving the crime time after time, the cops are always against him and ready to believe he's turned bad. Think Mannix, Cannon, Rockford Files, even Magnum P. I., or the like.",1364428800,,259,4.777777777777778

4356953,3,B004EPYZUS,"Not sure if Cruise's personal life makes him more or less appealing as an actor, but I still like watching good action flicks. Like so many sequels they don't quite beat the original-special effects aside.",1364256000,,205,4.885714285714286

4357088,3,B004EPYZUS,"The MI franchise is what it is - Hollywood mainstream action adventure mind candy. Good fun. Improbable plot and location jumps -  how do they get all their gear from Russia to Dubai? But it fulfills its promise, lots of explosions and high-wire hi-jinks. Solid example of its genre.",1364083200,,283,4.775510204081633
4357089,4,B004EPYZUS,"Good movie!  I love the action scenes and the stunts.  To me, Tom Cruise can get a bit campy in some of his movies so I was very happy that he didn't take his character too seriously and the one time he does get corny he makes fun of himself.",1364083200,,242,3.82

4357186,3,B004EPYZUS,"This is an OK movie that does not require any special effort on the viewers end to be followed. The spectator is not even required to have seen the previous MI movies.

4357189,2,B004EPYZUS,"One expects a lot of action, but this one had so much that was unbelievable.  This to me was one of the worst Mission Impossible's. There are two positives about this movie, the locations/scenery and the ending because of its' personal touch.",1363996800,,242,4.761904761904762

4357305,3,B004EPYZUS,"Tom Cruise seems to still have the formula right to put out the stock action movie. Because we know Cruise is true to his profession and creates so much reality we can enjoy his movie for what they are..As normal,the action moves along in extreme settings while trying to develop its characters and add some glint of needed humour. it will be interesting to see how he can inject some new edge to his next MI episode.",1363910400,,417,4.428571428571429

4357309,2,B004EPYZUS,"The franchise, and Cruise himself, should be retired at this point. Or maybe it is just a bad combination at this point and both sides should explore new options?",1363824000,,162,4.620689655172414
4357310,5,B004EPYZUS,"Highly enjoyed this movie; the action set pieces are some of the best I've ever seen and the making of features provide a glimpse as to how they made the stunts look so believable. The making of was almost as entertaining and exciting as the film itself in many ways. I remember very little of the previous Mission Impossible films but luckily, like James Bond films, MI doesn't require a lot of knowledge of the previous films to follow the story and become invested. Great action flick.",1363824000,,488,4.620689655172414

4357314,4,B004EPYZUS,"When my Blu-Ray Disc from netflix wouldn't play I turned to streaming and grabbed this movie. The stream ran without any real buffering and I was happy with bitrate, picture and sound.
The movie itself, is enjoyable with good plot points and action
There are several plot holes and continuity errors- pretty standard for action movies and Tom Cruise's performance is not as good as it could be.
The script is tight but does not grab your emotions very firmly. The supporting cast is really what makes up for any lack you feel in the tug of the plot or main character.
Overall I enjoyed it. Not enough to want to own it or even watch it again unless it was on TV and the choice came down to it and Duck Dynasty.",1363737600,,710,4.345864661654136

4357536,5,B004EPYZUS,Tom cruise & Jeremy renner together???  Badass!  I knew when I saw renner in Swat that he'd be perfect for a spy role.  Awesome movie and the views from the burj... Amazing!!,1363564800,,174,4.375

4357538,4,B004EPYZUS,the franchise still trying to recover for how bad mi2 was is back to originality this round.  The costume designer dressed TC perfectly and gave us all a lot to look at,1363564800,,168,4.25
4357539,5,B004EPYZUS,I love it! Watched it twice. Tom Cruise is my favorite actor in action movies. Mission impossible series hasn't lost its edge at all while I can't say the same for 007 series..,1363564800,,176,4.363636363636363

4357637,3,B004EPYZUS,"I enjoy a popcorn movie simply because it is a popcorn movie. Some that come out know this and go about doing their job to entertain you. Ten their are some that take themselves too seriously, MI: Ghost Protocol is one of them. I just don't know, the action was entertaining enough. Maybe it's the fact that Cruise and most of the cast (except Simon Pegg) just take themselves way too seriously. But hey, it's on Amazon Prime now, so watch it and enjoy the popcorn.",1363305600,,465,4.4186046511627906
4357638,5,B004EPYZUS,This is a good franchise for Tom Cruise.  He does this character well and chooses good people for the rolls with him.  His choices were spot-on in this one as well.  His female leads and of course Jeremy Renner were excellent.,1363305600,,226,4.463414634146342

4357745,2,B004EPYZUS,Too improbable to be interesting. Tom Cruise consumes every frame of the movie without contributing a single shred of acting.,1363219200,,125,5.3
4357746,4,B004EPYZUS,"Tend to prefer the more thoughtful dialogue driven movies and watch the big special effects type things for pure escapism.  Pleasantly surprised how engaging this was - and I'm not much of a TCruise fan, either.  It's a fun watch, pretty people, some awesome larger-than-life settings, not too much time spent on the obligatory car-chase - and done in a huge sandstorm is a fun touch.  If you just want a little light entertainment where you don't have to think but can still get some enjoyment, you could do much worse.",1363219200,,520,4.6923076923076925
4357747,5,B004EPYZUS,"I give it five stars for a movie of this type.  Lot's of action, impossibe stunts, hi tech wizardry, and plenty of old fashioned gun fire and explosions.  Escapists stuff.  Having said that it does have an underlying sentimental plot, one that isn't fully revealed until the end.  Mr. Cruise is at his impossible best and the supporting cast is great.  Make the popcorn and turn up the volume and just enjoy it for what it is, great fun.  And the girls can get all weepy at the end.

4357752,4,B004EPYZUS,"Ghost Protocol was a fun movie in a genre that I and my family like a lot. Great action, but unfortunate that ""Sawyer"" got knocked off in the first several minutes. Also, the scene in which Tom Cruise's team is impersonating various people in the hotel reminded me a little too much of something from the Three Stooges. Nonetheless, it is a fun movie that I would watch again.",1363046400,,376,4.463768115942029

The movie had all the formulaic ingredients for over the top action and excitement, and I don't mind if a plot is stereotypical as long as it is well done, but it just did not engage me at all - I could not feel anything for any of the characters.  We didn't even make it to the obviously impending sandstorm when I turned to my husband & said 'I can't believe it but I don't even care what happens next'.  He agreed & we turned it off & decided to re-watch something else.  I barely even remember any details of the plot.

So after the last two bombs I wasn't expecting much at all, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The story wasn't absurd and the overall aesthetic improved (especially over the slow motion Tom Cruise-a-thon's that the series became in MI2/3).  Good humor blended throughout as well.

On the whole, I loved the stunt actions that were pushed to limits. In my case, as a hearing impaired using hearing aids  and therefore relying  somewhat on  the dialog through close captioning which is not available in ""instant viewing"", I missed out on some dialog important to the plot.
As a general comment on the current MI series, I must say that the original TV series, although lacking the kind of action and computer animation possible in today's film making, relied more on refined deception of villains instead of spectacular action and therefore seemed more clever in concept.

Seriously.... Did this movie make any money? I've seen car wrecks with better stories and more finesse. If this movie cost .25 to rent, I would have felt ripped off. Only Bloodrayne made me want to punch myself in the manhood more than this.",1363046400,,506,4.270833333333333

4357878,4,B004EPYZUS,"I wasn't sure if this was suppose to be funny, but I figured with Simon Pegg as a supporting character it had to be. I enjoyed how the technology and mechanical things kept going wrong. I appreciated the irony of the GPS tracking scene and how the things that did go wrong actually go wrong for the rest of us in real life. I am glad that it didn't take itself too seriously and allowed for the hero to be only a above average instead of implausible.

4357881,2,B004EPYZUS,It seems like movies are becoming more reactionary and impulsive with very simple dialogue.  Skyfall is another example.  My theory is that the filmakers keep the dialogue simple to make translating the script to other languages simpler.,1362873600,,237,5.378378378378378

I would have liked to see more of a Tie-In to the Last ""Episode"", and why the other Member of the Cast wasn't In the Movie until the end, since in prior Sequels he was a Key Player..

A submarine launched ICBM has a single warhead? The ICBM comes in under power on the re-entry phase of the flight? It isn't set to go off at altitude? A missile coming in from space through the atmosphere (super hot ionized gases surrounding it) can receive an abort code milliseconds from detonation? The MIRV weapons are like 3"" octagons, this one is 2' in diameter and takes out a spire? You can stick a card in a card reader and figure out the codes to send to open doors? The car, the weapons, the hall screen, the cooling system, the maglev, the connecting into security and elevator controls. Argh! I haven't even discussed the whole Dubai Hotel thing. Fun to watch, but I had to shut off my brain. Safe to say if this is what it takes to rescue me from bad guys, I'll take Rambo, Jackie Chan, or Mr T. At least their stuff is believable. Cruise could get better technical advice than this? Great action, I loved the ending scene. Reasonable acting.  It would be more enjoyable if it had more reality.",1362787200,,1173,4.507042253521127

It may be time for this franchise to find a new leading man.

This is likely not his fault, but our own, as audiences now seem to demand violent action in movies, rather than the tension and drama of the IMF pulling off a mission through stealthy cunning and turning the bad guys behavior (greed, for example) against himself.

4358303,4,B004EPYZUS,The movie is very entertaining and doesn't take itself too seriously like its predecessors in the franchise.  I recommend it.,1362355200,,125,5.25
4358304,5,B004EPYZUS,"This a great action movie, on par with MI:3, however, not as good mind you, but still a solid action spy movie nevertheless.",1362355200,,124,4.434782608695652
4358305,1,B004EPYZUS,I have not been able to find help to resolve the networking issues with the app.  Will probably have to cancel my Prime membership if this isn't resolved quickly.,1362355200,,162,4.586206896551724

4358307,4,B004EPYZUS,If you are a fan of  Mission Impossible you will want to see this. It had great special effects and it needs yo be seen on a HD television.,1362355200,,139,3.793103448275862
4358308,5,B004EPYZUS,The epitome of an action film. Tom Cruise delivers again. Highly recommended. What will MP V look like to top this?,1362355200,,115,4.523809523809524

4358403,5,B004EPYZUS,"The cars, gadgets, and explosions were classic MI stalled. I loved it! Espionage is always the way to go for spy movies.",1362268800,,120,4.5

4358411,4,B004EPYZUS,Graphics were great.  Like the Mission Impossible series.  Not real but still has a story line that is high in entertainment value.,1362096000,,131,4.909090909090909
4358491,4,B004EPYZUS,"I am not a fan of Tom Cruise but always liked the movies,  I started watched Mission when it was a TV series and never missed an episode.  I have seem most of the movies, this one was good, the action scenes were worth buying this movie, jumping out of this tall build was very scary and exciting.",1362096000,,297,4.103448275862069
4358492,5,B004EPYZUS,One of the better ones! It used to be that sequels were not worth watching...not any more! I think I like this better than the original!,1362096000,,136,4.269230769230769

4358496,5,B004EPYZUS,This was another typically good movie in the Mission Impossible series. The skyscraper scene was pretty good but as a whole the whole movie kept my attention.,1362009600,,158,4.888888888888889
4358497,4,B004EPYZUS,"I normally don't care much for the Mission Impossible franchise. I watched this because I saw it was directed by Brad Bird, of Pixar fame. The story is easy to follow, and the movie is of course a lot of eye candy. I think Tom Cruise looks a little more mature than in the past, which is nice.",1362009600,,293,4.068965517241379
4358498,5,B004EPYZUS,"The movie was lame, but the quality was perfect.  Tom Cruise is lame.  I watched it on my Macbook Pro.",1362009600,,102,4.05

4358582,5,B004EPYZUS,"Didn't think the fourth Mission Impossible could possibly be as good as previous ones, but this one was.  Great action, decent plot.  Definitely entertaining.",1361923200,,158,5.541666666666667
4358583,5,B004EPYZUS,"I enjoy all of the Mission Impossible movies, and Ghost Protocol did not disappoint.  The story is fast paced and the ending is surprising.",1361923200,,139,4.791666666666667
4358584,4,B004EPYZUS,"This movie had lots of action and a good story line.  If you liked the other Mission Impossible movies, you'll probably like this one too.  That being said, some of the action elements of the movie seemed forced just, action for action's sake.",1361923200,,243,4.627906976744186
4358585,5,B004EPYZUS,"Very entertaining movie.  Awesome special effects, plot is boring but all around it was a pretty good movie. It is worth picking up for you collection.",1361923200,,151,4.8076923076923075

4358587,3,B004EPYZUS,"The plots works at capturing your interest, mostly with technical effects. and generally succeeds.  It pleasantly fills some spare time and tries to hook you into the next such movie.",1361923200,,183,5.1
4358588,4,B004EPYZUS,I loved this one a lot. This was an 'Edge of your seat' action movie I would watch again and again.,1361923200,,99,3.761904761904762
4358589,4,B004EPYZUS,"They corrected a lot of the MI series issues, like odd looking effects and added some light humor while keeping the interesting plot that makes MI a favorite.",1361923200,,158,4.678571428571429
4358590,4,B004EPYZUS,I think its better then skyfall 007 in my opinion I love all the gadget use in the movie down to action very good watch,1361923200,,119,3.8
4358721,4,B004EPYZUS,The movie itself was very good but even with the Kindle sound at its highest setting the sound was indistinct at times,1361923200,,118,4.409090909090909
4358722,3,B004EPYZUS,"This is your standard over the top action flick no more no less.

I would recommend this if you want a slower passed action flick with poor acting to help you pass the time.",1361923200,,173,4.088235294117647

4358724,5,B004EPYZUS,Tom Cruise franchise is always good and entertaining. This one must be the most entertaining actioner since the first movie. Great fun.,1361923200,,135,5.181818181818182

worth the watch...nice film footage too. enjoy!",1361923200,,116,4.8
4358726,5,B004EPYZUS,"breathtaking stunts, I love seeing different places, although for sure they shoot/film some part of it in a studio. This is a very good movie.",1361923200,,142,4.72
4358727,5,B004EPYZUS,"I really liked this movie.  I'm a fan of the franchise, so it was looking forward to watching this movie.  The action sequences were quite good, and the humor in the script was a good counterpoint to the drama of the plot.  I don't think they gave Jeremy Renner or the other cast members enough action.  Tom Cruise pretty much had all of the good action scenes.  Another point in its favor is the lack of foul language.  Most action movies are so peppered with bad language that I find it off-putting.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and if the ending is any indication, I would probably watch the next movie when it is made.",1361923200,,625,4.3826086956521735
4358728,4,B004EPYZUS,"It seemed like a pretty good movie, but watching it on my desktop wasn't very pleasurable. I missed some audio and my screen is too small. I think WIFI to a large flatscreen is the only way to watch these movies.",1361923200,,212,4.195121951219512
4358729,4,B004EPYZUS,We tried to watch on amazon prime and it wouldn't load fast enough so we had to watch it on Netflix.,1361836800,,100,3.8095238095238093
4358730,5,B004EPYZUS,"I'm not a Cruise supporter, but he's been good in everything I've seen including this movie. Non-stop action. The standard MI plot goes out the window ... I don't want to spoil it for you. It's really a fun movie. Worth watching again.",1361836800,,235,4.488372093023256
4358881,5,B004EPYZUS,Tom Cruise is in great form and totally believable as the action hero. The direction and cinematography is superb. This is by far the best feature in the franchise.,1361836800,,164,4.689655172413793
4358882,4,B004EPYZUS,"Ok, yeah.....you would think these movies are getting a little old but......NOOOOOOO!!!!
It was a ton of fun to watch.
Exotic locations an inventive plot and great acting made the movie a great ""watch"".
The special effects were great and Tom Cruise was great.
I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.",1361836800,,310,4.7592592592592595
4358883,4,B004EPYZUS,It was a good action movie w/ some terriffic stunts but because it's the third one it's kind of lost some of the excitement about it.  It was well played by the actors but again it was pretty easy to figure out the plot and to see what was coming next.  Plus some of the gadgets were pretty far fetched but I guess that's par for the course for MI3 huh??....lol!!!  Overall it was a good action movie and since it was free thru the Prime Membership it was worth the money so to speak...lol!!,1361836800,,491,4.147368421052631
4358884,3,B004EPYZUS,Over the top too Hollywood.  Several convenient segues with little explanation of how the heck they just did that.  Best scenes were the ones around the Burg Khalifa and the party in India.  Worst scene was the sand storm.,1361836800,,222,4.641025641025641
4358885,5,B004EPYZUS,"Great entertainment!!

Best of the MI movies so far.  This one adds a lot of humor.  The MI crew that backs up Cruise looks like the second string team but perform well and are entertaining.  They have personalities.

Movie looks great on mobile device.

Highly recommend!",1361836800,,272,4.804347826086956
4358886,5,B004EPYZUS,I don't find too many sequels as good as the original but Cruise did it with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.,1361836800,,113,4.181818181818182
4358887,5,B004EPYZUS,Great movie!  Tom cruise hasn't lost his knack. The acting and story line are both great.  You are pulled in quickly.  Good ending too - of course!,1361836800,,147,4.37037037037037
4358888,3,B004EPYZUS,"In my opinion this movie was better than its predecessor but the story was pretty weak.
Some cool gadgets were the only thing that I found interesting.
Not enough action and a very generic simple bad guy plot.",1361836800,,209,4.526315789473684
4358889,4,B004EPYZUS,"Lots of action but somewhat predictable. That said, it's still a good flic to watch when the networks are all broadcasting reality and reruns.",1361836800,,142,4.958333333333333
4358890,5,B004EPYZUS,it was really nice my lady likes action and i put it on for her she was totally amped when it went off,1361836800,,102,3.4782608695652173
4359031,1,B004EPYZUS,"This movie was looking pretty good but about half way throught the movie it got all choppy, then it froze.  It tried to come back a bunch of times but finally I gave up and just stopped watching it.",1361836800,,198,4.076923076923077
4359032,4,B004EPYZUS,"I like it and it is very exciting and as Tom, Cruise does most of his own stunts it adds something to the movie. The locations are very interesting and the scenry is quite amazing.  Tom Cruise is more realistic in this movie as opposed to the Jack Reacher movie he starred in.",1361836800,,276,4.2075471698113205
4359033,4,B004EPYZUS,"Just when I thought I was burned out on MI, they brought me back. Simon Pegg was awesome. I liked Renner too. Good team effort versus the Tom Cruise show.",1361836800,,154,4.166666666666667
4359034,5,B004EPYZUS,"Ghost Protocol was very actioned packed as per usual with Tom Cruise,Paula Patton was very refreshing and a great addition to cast as was Jeremy Renneir & Simon Pegg,loved the movie a lot!",1361836800,,188,4.7272727272727275
4359035,4,B004EPYZUS,As entertaining as any of the other IMF films.  The on-location shots were great.  Those with vertigo had better be prepared.,1361836800,,125,4.904761904761905
4359036,5,B004EPYZUS,very good I liked the movie but your review process should be limited to the stars not writing a review,1361836800,,103,4.2
4359037,5,B004EPYZUS,This is the best of the franchise. It's non-stop action from start to finish. The cast all has chemistry and work great together. I'm adding this to my exclusive favorites list.,1361836800,,177,4.741935483870968
4359038,4,B004EPYZUS,"This is a good escapist movie with lots of action.  Tom Cruise and company have lots of ""James Bond like"" gadgets.",1361836800,,114,4.428571428571429
4359039,4,B004EPYZUS,"The first will always be the best. Great line up of actors, producers and special effects. An action thriller. Sme of the technology Is too futuristic, but a good watch.",1361836800,,169,4.666666666666667
4359040,4,B004EPYZUS,"I was entertained for 2 hours, but I won't be adding it to my permanent collection.  Tom cruise is still a good actor even if a bit crazy.",1361836800,,138,3.9285714285714284
4359141,1,B004EPYZUS,The movie is a boring collection of action sequences connected with shots of Tom Cruise sprinting.  The action scenes overwhelmed the plot.,1361836800,3,139,5.318181818181818
4359142,4,B004EPYZUS,"This episode diverges from the gravitas of the earlier ones, but the actors put on a good show.  Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) makes the movie tick with his deadpan humor.",1361836800,,172,4.375
4359143,4,B004EPYZUS,"Enjoyed the movie and the convenience of using the Amazon program. Was uncertain of how all would work out; I was pleasantly surprised of how easily it was accomplished.

4359146,5,B004EPYZUS,Very action packed. Tom Cruz is the best actor and made the movie even more interesting to watch.  2nd movies are usually not as good as the 1st ones but this was really good.,1361836800,,175,4.147058823529412
4359147,3,B004EPYZUS,Passes the time but not much else. Generic plot with better acting from secondary characters which isn't saying much for this,1361836800,,125,5.0
4359148,5,B004EPYZUS,Great action and awesome cast.  And finally a Mission Impossible movie plot I actually understand! Great sequence in climbing the tower.,1361750400,,136,5.476190476190476

4359333,3,B004EPYZUS,"Honestly, I haven't seen the movie all the way through yet. My issue is that Amazon's viewer works horribly on my Android device.  Time to move away from Flash!  Not sure of the solution but am looking...",1361664000,,204,4.486486486486487

4359335,2,B004EPYZUS,Nothing like the original series. Lame comes to mind. Some good ideas for special effects poorly employed. Should have been a made for tv movie.,1361664000,,144,4.8
4359336,5,B004EPYZUS,Very good picture.... story line was incredibly irresistible... couldn't get enough of this movie..... yeah all should catch this... its the real deal,1361664000,,150,5.565217391304348
4359337,4,B004EPYZUS,enjoyed it. Good action adventure movie. Did not contain foul language nor unneeded sexual content. It shows this is not needed to make a good movie.,1361577600,,149,4.769230769230769
4359338,3,B004EPYZUS,It is your typical one man army saving the world from disaster. Although I did like some of the special effects.,1361577600,,112,4.380952380952381
4359339,4,B004EPYZUS,"this time cruise did a good job. The good thing about his movies is you know what to expect good action, humor and no thought required. Sit back and enjoy",1361577600,,154,4.166666666666667
4359340,4,B004EPYZUS,Great movie and they did it without fowl Language and nudity which seems hard these days for Hollywood to do.  A great piece of work! I was very impressed by all the stunts and action...will watch this a few more times!,1361577600,,219,4.341463414634147

4359502,3,B004EPYZUS,Failed to capture the audience in my opinion. Weak plot! The only thing holding it together are some of the action scenes.,1361491200,,122,4.590909090909091
4359503,5,B004EPYZUS,Probably one of the best MI movies in the franchise. Yes most of the cars were BMWs (and that concept car was gorgeous) but it was a very action packed film with a lot of intense moments. I enjoyed it a lot.,1361491200,,207,3.9523809523809526
4359504,5,B004EPYZUS,"Haven't seen it yet, but my daughter has and she said that she liked it very much. She said that it is right up there with the second one.",1361491200,,138,3.793103448275862
4359505,4,B004EPYZUS,Great movie.  Stays with traditional suspense and techno savvy.  Watched all of the original series years ago and have always liked the set up for the plot.,1361491200,,156,4.7407407407407405
4359506,4,B004EPYZUS,It still doesn't have the impact as James Bond or the original Mission Impossible but is a fun movie to watch.,1361404800,,110,4.285714285714286
4359507,3,B004EPYZUS,"The item I received was not the item advertised. The product description indicated ""Three disc Blu Ray special edition"" What I received was a 1 disc rental copy with no special features. Delivery time acceptable""",1361404800,,212,5.085714285714285
4359508,4,B004EPYZUS,Movie was well done. Action was fast-paced and exciting. One of the best of the series. I loved those scenes at the  Dubai hotel. It blew me away,1361404800,,145,4.178571428571429
4359509,5,B004EPYZUS,"There is a finer art and a creative work in making movies and in titles like these, with almost name brand recognition there is a standard to exceed. And Cruise with his team nailed it on this production. Memorable!",1361404800,,215,4.538461538461538
4359510,4,B004EPYZUS,"Love the Mission Impposible franchise,Tom Cruise is fantastic in this role. Hopefully he will continue churning them out yearly till he,s  98",1361404800,,141,5.409090909090909

4359663,4,B004EPYZUS,This movie has an interesting plot and setting. The characters are more mature and better developed than in the previous Mission Impossible movie.,1361404800,,146,5.391304347826087
4359664,5,B004EPYZUS,Awesome. Lots of action. Tom Cruise was excellent. The video didn't stop or skip and the audio synced up nicely.,1361404800,,112,4.65

4359668,4,B004EPYZUS,I like this movie. It's a great action movie and keep you on your toes. I wanted to know what was good to happen next. Tom Cruise makes great movies. A great get togather movie with the family.,1361404800,,193,4.105263157894737
4359669,5,B004EPYZUS,MI Ghost Protocol was a excellent film to add to the series.  Also it was great to watch the film via amazon instant video during a free trial of amazon prime. I'm tempted to buy the dvd blue ready to add to the collection.,1361404800,,223,4.068181818181818

4359731,4,B004EPYZUS,A predictible storyline and spectacular special effects delivery what MI fans come to expect. The supporting cast add more interest to the movie than the Tom Cruise character.,1361404800,,175,5.285714285714286

4359734,5,B004EPYZUS,"Tom Cruise has done it again except this time his team has an edge. A comedic edge that it. Aside from the brilliant cinematographic feats of creativity and altitude, gorgeous scenery and a cleverly written and witty script, the actors are the real glue of this film. Jeremy Renner is the next big thing once he gets past this Hansel/Gretel mistake, and works well with Tom Cruise's confident character, Simon Pegg's comedic relief, and that girl from Deja-Vu's beauty and elegance. A winning combination with almost no sappy love drama involved except a little revenge for a fallen agent early on. The last 2 have been good but this is the best one since the original  so far I think.",1361232000,,685,4.708333333333333

4359901,5,B004EPYZUS,"This movie is better than the previous ones in that Tom Cruise is not the only action hero nor is the mission only left up to him but to his thrown-together team, who manages to make a great team with some humor. The gadgets and gear used in this movie are mind-blowing. The setting in the infamous Dubai hotel and the culture this movie brings is like a breath of fresh air. The movie poster showing him dangling by one electromagnetic glove after the other one quit working is a scene set in Dubai at the Dubai hotel, and even this scene isn't taken so seriously at one point. It's just a small piece of this must-see movie. :)",1361145600,,629,4.294117647058823

4359910,5,B004EPYZUS,Some parts of it were a lil lame like the cast (the chick and shaun of the dead dude) lol but action packed! Cruise did very well.,1360886400,,130,3.8518518518518516

4359996,4,B004EPYZUS,"This movie adds a lot more comedy than the other Mission Impossible movies. It's lighthearted tone allows you to enjoy the movie a little more. The others in the series are so far fetched, it's hard to believe any of it. The laughs in this one distract from how unrealistic it all is. I thought it helped the flow and added more depth.",1360800000,,335,4.333333333333333

4360098,5,B004EPYZUS,My husband and I are total fans of the Mission Impossible or should I say Impossible Mission. Aka (IMF) we watched the original with the greatest cast that no one can begin to replace. However Tom Cruise does a great job...,1360713600,,223,4.463414634146342

I really loved the added bits of humor that he threw into the movie. Some might not think it fitting for the MI series, but I really got a great chuckle out of all the characters and failing technology.

There were just a lot of moments that were just very fun and cool to watch, definitely a perfect movie for when you just want to have some mindless entertainment.",1360627200,,480,4.217391304347826

4360254,3,B004EPYZUS,Didn't like the plot that much compared to past MI films. Special effects and setting were a bit contrived as well. Just an average action film. Expected a bit more from the budget and franchise.,1360540800,,195,4.6

4360257,3,B004EPYZUS,I prefer the slightly more down to earth spy thrillers like the Bourne series. Some of the scenes like the Dubai building climb are great though.,1360454400,,145,4.615384615384615

4360562,4,B004EPYZUS,"Some pretty outrageous stunt scenes where you have to push the ""I believe button"" but it was on par with the last few MI movies for entertainment value.  The new BMW  i8 hybrid was the star of the show.",1360454400,,202,4.153846153846154

4360637,4,B004EPYZUS,I thought this movie wa a good one and one to put with the other ones that has been made. I think it is time ti move on to something else. There has been too many of the Missiom Impossible movies done.,1360022400,,201,3.8095238095238093

4360748,3,B004EPYZUS,"I mean I liked it, but I think that is enough with mission impossible. I liked Tom Cruise in it he is pretty good in all his movies. For a typical action movie it was good. I would say you will still like the movie because the action was good and the story line was good. I would watch it again.",1359936000,,295,3.8524590163934427
4360749,5,B004EPYZUS,"This is another great MI film, was not a fan of MI 1 or 2 but MI 3 and this film are the two better films, the action, humor, and suspense are here in another IMF adventure that picks up soon after the 3rd film. The locals that the film visits are beautiful and the sand storm is a realistic representation of how they really occur in the desert.

I'd recommend this film to anyone who wants a good story but also a film that you can just pick up and watch.",1359849600,,457,3.967391304347826
4360750,5,B004EPYZUS,This movie was great.  It is my favorite of the Mission impossible movies.  I like the action and humor.  I watched this movie  2 times which is good because I don't like watching just ok movies twice.,1359849600,,201,4.351351351351352

4360755,3,B004EPYZUS,"a lot of it makes no sense. I don't want to give too  much away, but characters have nifty gadgets, which are technically impossible (but it IS Mission IMPOSSIBLE, so ...) but then aren't wearing body armor into the potentially dangerous situation, or they take actions that turn out to be unnecessary. You don't think about the inconsistencies while you're watching it, but it leaves a bitter aftertaste that a little better writing/producing could have avoided. I think I had higher expectations due to JJ Abrams involvement.",1359590400,,527,5.057471264367816
4360756,4,B004EPYZUS,"One could say that Mission Impossible is America's version of James Bond, except that our hero is married and faithful to his wife; maybe a credit to star actor Tom Cruise's membership in Scientology.  Given that statement, last year saw both a James Bond and a Mission Impossible film released.  Plot lines from both movies shared some traits; i.e. the death of a key supporting figure, two sexy female action stars, and of course the standard betrayals and gadgets.  All of this leads one to consider that maybe the screenwriters of both films hang out together.  Irregardless, this was a good movie, and probably the best MI film yet.  The lead actor is the same as before, but the rest of the IMF crew is new, with Paula Patton essentially having a breakout role in this film, showing of her looks, action skills, and some decent acting in the process.  Jeremy Renner is also featured, making this the third action franchise he is starring in, following his roles in the Bourne films and Marvel films.  The special effects are great, with awesome settings, in this case on the outer walls of an Arabian skyscraper.  Overall, one of 2012's better action films.",1359590400,,1163,4.751243781094527
4360887,4,B004EPYZUS,Loved this latest installment in the M.I. franchise! I really liked the addition of a little more humor. The balance of humor and white-knuckle suspense creates a great entertainment experience.,1359504000,,194,5.5

However, something was done in right in Ghost Protocol. In it we find that Ethan Hawke and his team are in essence framed, which in turn makes the US seem like the bad guys, and they have to do the impossible to prove otherwise.
I have to say I really liked Tom Cruise in this 4th installment. I found him much more humble and not as cocky as in his other movies. Also, I enjoyed the sarcastic remarks, it made the movie seem more realistic among all the unrealistic stunts.",1359417600,,614,4.168067226890757

4361038,3,B004EPYZUS,I enjoyed it but for some reason it seemed to lack to Spy/Cloak and Dagger type of action in these movie I expect. It was a typcial Tom Cruise star role fighting a seemingly impossible situation and time table to save the world. Naturally in all Tom's movies he plays these roles but this movie was just lacking something the previous IMs had at least for me.,1358812800,,359,4.373134328358209

If I remember correctly the last one was pretty good and I liked this one even better,  It was as always action packed but left you wondering til the end who done it and what was going to happen.

Cruise should have taken another item from our favorite British agent:  How to look cool when you're over 50. I could not take this old man seriously in jeans and a hoodie.  Tommy looks too old to wear the clothes of a teenager.

Finally, how does our super-agent, who handled dozens of enemy agents across several time zones get his ass kicked at the end by a frumpy, overweight, 65-year-old? Enough was enough at that point.

I always appreciate sequels that maintain or exceed the quality of their predecessors. I loved MI3, in particular, scenes like swinging over to the other building - which had me on the edge of my seat. This movie, I don't think I'd be giving away plot when I say the building scene in this one, with the gloves and then trying to get back down to the room, wow, I was on the edge of my seat again(!) lol.

4361046,4,B004EPYZUS,"I got a sense of deja-vu watching Ghost Protocol.  The plot follows the same skeleton as the first Mission Impossible movie.  Only the locations, characters, and technology changed.  But being like the original movie isn't a bad thing as that is one of the better ones.  But I did find myself being a little bored throughout the movie because I always know that Ethan Hunt and team will always survive and get the job done.  Even when the best laid plans fall apart, you can always count on the writers of the movie to just choreograph a fast-paced fight scene where Ethan somehow takes out dozens of armed men to save the day.

When I saw the trailer for Ghost Protocol as well as the posters with Ethan Hunt in a hoodie, I was really hoping for something a little more gritty.  I wanted to see what Ethan and other IMF agents could do when they don't have a lot of fancy technology, but instead have to rely on their wits.  Well, if they did that then this wouldn't be a Mission Impossible movie would it?  Just like the old Batman TV show, Ethan always seems to have the right technology at his side for any given situation.  And like I said earlier, when technology fails Ethan Hunt is always up for a good 12 on 1 fight.",1358553600,,1225,4.333333333333333

4361148,2,B004EPYZUS,"For an MI episode the plot was right out of a Steven Segal movie from 1996.  As Maxwell Smart might say ""the old steal the nukes from the former Soviet Union"" scenario.

If you ignore that the main premise has totally been done a gazillion times the action, thrills and cast interaction keep your attention.

One thing lacking was the jaw dropping final chase sequence, but the actors somehow made up for it.  This almost might make a better TV series than a movie franchise if you could get them to reprise their roles on the small screen.",1358553600,,540,4.479591836734694

The script needed better focus, the entire production was about 10-15 minutes too long, and the cast was only so-so. Cruise's nod to ""being hip"" & ""current"" with his ""hoodie"" image was/is really a stretch !  Could have done without that for sure.

All-in-all, outside of a few special effects, ""Ghost Protocol"" was a film that I hoped would pick-up-speed, get focused, or, just plain get to the good part of the script...but, alas, that was not to be.

Confusing, disjointed, only mildly entertaining...and w-a-y too long.  (Spoiler alert: The ""chase"" sequence during the sandstorm could have been shortened by about 2  minutes and might have been good.  As it was, I kept waiting for it to be over !)",1358467200,,946,4.930379746835443
4361151,5,B004EPYZUS,"It had been a while since the first 3 Mission Impossible films and many people including myself I'm sure were not expecting it to be brought back, but sure enough it did, and I think I read that they're planning to do more, which is okay by me, because I love the Mission Impossible movies and they have so far all been pretty good.

This one is no exception, and as a matter of fact this particular one is one of my top favorites of those movies...probably number 2 next to the original, followed by 2 and then 3...they're all good though!  One of my dad and I's favorite types of movies to go to are action and espionage, and we of course didn't miss this one in the theater!

As far as cast, most of the original cast members did not return in Ghost Protocol, other than of course Tom Cruise.  (Ving Rhames does not star in the movie but does make a special guest appearance at one point...I won't say when or for what).  Anyway, say what you will about Tom Cruise as a person but the man is a great actor and has been in many great films, and this is certainly one of them...he does a great job as usual in this.

I was very pleased to see that Simon Pegg was added to the roster as the tech guy...perfect role for him, and I absolutely love him as an actor, ever since Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, and he was phenomenal as the new and younger Scottie in the new franchise of Star Trek movies.  Awesome also was the introduction of Jeremy Renner into the Mission Impossible roster...the man is an absolute action/thriller/espionage genius of an actor and he would have been an obvious choice in my book to play the role he did in this film.  I was not all that familiar with Paula Patton before this film, but she shined in this movie as well I thought.

The action sequences are engaging and very well coreographed I thought, and a couple of parts keep you leaning on the edge of your seat.  The story was good and seemed believable enough too.

To boil it all down, if you love action and espionage at all, this movie is very good.  If you love those kind of movies and haven't even seen any or all of the past Mission Impossible films, then what the heck?  Get on it friends!",1358380800,,2185,4.2235576923076925

4361153,5,B004EPYZUS,"Actually a good action film. I wasn't expecting much and the cheap intro sequence didn't exactly draw me in. But a brisk paced and light hearted story really kept me entertained the entire time.

4361216,3,B004EPYZUS,"It's always amusing to see brands show off their products in movies.  For Ghost Protocol, BMW took center stage with their X5, 6 series, and upcoming i5 electric vehicle.  Dubai's Burj Khalifa was also showcased with an extramural climb by TC, but it didn't actually give a full sense of the building's height.  The story itself was depressing even though the feeling of global devastation wasn't conveyed very well.  Overall, the movie had some good action sequences and some entertaining comic relief...especially when Hunt and Brandt were trying to board the boxcar.",1358294400,,569,5.1521739130434785

As with all Action-Adventure movies here or there are a couple of things that are a little on the far fetched side but what the hell it all gets pulled together as the movie goes along.  If you like this kind of movie, then buy it.  If you don't, well, to each his own.  Herb.",1358208000,,451,4.114942528735632

4361219,5,B004EPYZUS,Crazy. I love this series. The action and suspense were great. It was wonderfully done and kept with the theme of MI1 and MI3.  I can't wait for the next one to be released,1358208000,,172,4.0588235294117645

4361221,5,B004EPYZUS,"The mission impossible movies continue to be some of my favorite films due to their james bond quality action and set pieces,
but like MI:3,  Ghost protocol takes it a step further and really pushes the multi faceted nature of it's characters.  Like all great films the film is really about the people in it....these people just happen to be secret agents trying to save the world:)
Brad Bird really rocks this story, and leaves you panting trying to catch your breath.  Kudos to Cruise on taking a chance with this brilliant animation director.",1358121600,,545,4.776595744680851

4361225,3,B004EPYZUS,"I had heard great things about this movie, and that it blew away all the previous Mission Impossible movies.  Unfortunately, I think that was just a lot of hype that was spread around to attempt to revive Tom Cruises' career.  The movie was okay, but definitely not the best of the series.",1357948800,,289,4.538461538461538
4361275,1,B004EPYZUS,"Hard to judge it on any other realm..  We all know our expectations for acting or even directing tend to pretty low for ""action"" films..  but if you're not going to even bother spending a little extra time on the effects even on a relatively high budget film like this then what the hell?!!?

But judging from many of the other reviews ...  I guess all you need to do is spend the budget on good advertising to convince the public that they like what they see.",1357948800,,460,4.252873563218391
4361276,4,B004EPYZUS,"At times this next ""mission"" of the franchise leaves me breathless and heart pounding. I have never base-jumped, and can only imagine the blended terror and thrill; but the long, action filled scenes and split-second timing works as all of us have come to expect from Ethan and his team. As the action unfolds, the plot reveals itself grudgingly. Every time I anticipated the next factoid to zoom into focus, a twist of fate intervened. Great entertainment!",1357948800,,457,4.9480519480519485
4361277,5,B004EPYZUS,Really enjoyed this story. It is my favorite so far of the many MI's with Tom Cruise. Seems to have more substantial story.,1357948800,,123,4.391304347826087

4361284,4,B004EPYZUS,Not bad for the MI series. I think I like the previous one better. Seemed to be more climactic as compared to this flick. Definitely like Jeremy Renner and the dude from Shaun of the Dead. Thought the woman in the group was average.,1357776000,,232,4.295454545454546
4361384,4,B004EPYZUS,I have enjoyed all of the Mission Impossible films and this one did not disappoiint.  It is one that I would see again,1357776000,,118,4.130434782608695
4361385,5,B004EPYZUS,This was action from start to finish and I believe the best MI movie to date.  Tom Cruise shows his best acting skills in this one.  A real nail-biter.,1357776000,,151,4.172413793103448
4361386,3,B004EPYZUS,Then I watched it again and it was just okay.  I lost interest mid way but I love Jeremy Renner and that kept me through for the rest of the movie.,1357776000,,147,3.7419354838709675

4361388,2,B004EPYZUS,"It certainly has some tricky ideas, but Tom should have retired years ago. In fact, thinking back, his breakdown on Oprah's show was far more entertaining than this worn-out franchise. Had it been any other actor (except Matt) this would never have made it to Mission: Impossible 2 let alone 5!!!!! This and the BOURNE franchise are so over-hyped that Chuck Dee got a rash when he watched it. Don't- Don't believe the Hype!",1357689600,,423,4.72972972972973

While I still don't care for Cruise after watching Ghost Protocol, Pegg added some lightness and humor to the script, and Renner put another good humored tough guy into the mix. Oh, and I'm a fan of the director Brad Bird, who directed Iron Giant and The Incredibles. The action sequences were breathtaking. As the star, of course Cruise is going to do most of the awesome stunts, and him crawling up the side of a building, and fighting the bad guy in a parking garage had me holding my breath.

4361714,4,B004EPYZUS,"After the hyper-serious but I'm not buying it snore-fest of MI-3 you would be forgiven for giving this a miss, but that would be a mistake. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to see past MI-3 and give the franchise another chance, you will be rewarded. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't, but it has rediscovered it's sense of humour, and Tom effectively takes the piss out of the easiest person on the planet to take the piss out of: Tom Cruise. Simon Pegg, much though I love him, is rather stale in his apparently ubiquitous role as comic relief, but none the less, the movie comes across as suprisingly fresh and fun. There is much more of a classic MI ""look, this is ridiculous nonsense but just go with it"" feel to MI-4, and if that is what you are looking for, you will be rewarded.

4361822,2,B004EPYZUS,"My wife enjoyed this movie much more than I did. There aren't any real faults I can complain about but, to me, the strength of a movie like this is tension and suspense, but because so much of this movie is rehash and cliche, there isn't any tension or suspense.",1356480000,,262,4.26

4361900,4,B004EPYZUS,"Let us face it: the movie is a grotesque. It does not have a single believable action scene. James Bond movies look like documentaries in comparison. The MI franchisee has become a parody for spy movies. Almost like Archer.

However, I still liked it. Probably because I like Archer.",1356393600,,283,4.775510204081633

Same thing happened a week or so before when I watched Expendables 2 and it had the same problem.  IT seems more and more of recorded messages and the time that takes to talk to someone is ridiculous for companies who make millions and billions each year that they cannot afford to hire enough people to make you want to buy anything from them.

What really took me as a surprise was Jeremy Renner's character: finally, a spy movie where an equally competent agent does not betray the team for pretentious reasons. Plus, the female agent in this movie kicks arse! Lastly, the humor was actually pretty good and not pompously delivered.

On the other hand, Amazon.com has provided another exceptional service. I was actually expecting to receive the package sometime after Christmas day, and it was a real joy when it arrived a lot sooner than expected. Moreover, the website provided me a free (limited) access of the streaming movie version. Naturally, I immediately watched this awesome movie and another one from Amazon.

I will say this though, all the spy parodies, all the innuedo from other sources did make the people at Eon really look at Bond and reboot it to what it is today.

It came across as if someone's vision of the movie was conflicted from the very start, because the movie itself was all over the place.  Tom Cruise gave a lackluster performance as super spy Ethan Hunt, but his entire crew for this movie seemed inept.  With the exception of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt who's performance was outstanding, the rest of the team appeared to be miscast in their roles.  Michael Nyqvist, of the original Dragon Tatoo movies was also gave a very good performance as Kurt Hendricks.

The story itself presented as a comedy of errors more than anything.  Not even close to what I expected from the Mission Impossible movies.  While diehard Cruise fans will probably enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend it.",1354233600,,811,4.919117647058823

4362392,2,B004EPYZUS,"There's always been a certain amount of cheese in the MI films, but the progression from the original to MI:3 had tempered that a little bit and gradually brought a harder edge to the stories. Now we have Ghost Protocol which feels like a complete turnaround, taking us back to MI territory (and beyond) with sloppy writing, a kind of silly and incomplete story, and cheese cheese cheese. Even the action sequences seem to not take themselves seriously.

I wouldn't say that this is bad in general and plenty of movies relish in this stuff, but Ghost Protocol just doesn't seem to pull it off. Part of the problem here could be my expectations from MI:3 which went to some dark territory, but GP does have problems that are entirely it's own. The plot is paper thin and doesn't make a lot of sense even in the moment, and once again we're back to a tired plot line about agents being disavowed and having to work on their own to clear their names. Didn't we cover this ground in the first movie? Yes, this time it's on a larger scale, but that doesn't make it better.",1353974400,,1067,4.4438775510204085

4362531,5,B004EPYZUS,"Wow!

This is one of those movies thats a little hard to review without being silly. Is there any point to this film besides entertainment? Nah. As somebody says in the film, There is only the mission.

But what a ride! The movies is chock full of great set pieces. And as with The Avengers, the storytellers at the helm know exactly how to pace an action sequence, even when it has multiple elements and takes place in several different rooms. This was a vast improvement, in my eyes, over the third Mission Impossible movie. I recall one really excellent sequence in that one where the team has to infiltrate the Vatican. The rest was your standard action movie - things blowing up, people chasing other people. MI4 is basically structured around three main missions and one prologue mission. Plain and simple.

Thing is, these aren't your standard sequels. These movies get made when the stars align just right, I think. Theyre like the Bourne films or the Bond films. A central concept or character holds down what is essentially a very long, very high budget television show. So the success of the film is going to hinge exclusively on the creative talent behind it, executing something fun. And this film does that. The opening title sequence is great fun - I don't know, I got a kick out of the movie foreshadowing everything that was to come. The stars are great - Simon Pegg is the most inspired cast member as the comic relief, but Tom Cruise can still hold his own as a cool badass, and Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton are excellent too. And the climax is great - the music screeches to a temporary halt as those various elements I mentioned struggle to come together at the last  possible  moment!

(Somewhere before I said that Michael Giacchino is the next John Williams. He may not have scored The Avengers, but I didn't notice that films music nearly as often as I did in this movie. Theres some really excellent work here.)

Of course I wish I could have seen this on the big screen, where the IMAX photography that took place on an actual skyscraper in Dubai would really have popped. But this is still way, way too much fun for what it is.",1353715200,,2157,4.543814432989691

4362599,4,B004EPYZUS,"I have liked the last three MI movies.  (The first portrayed Jim Phelps as a villain -- horrible idea.)  However, the action has superceded the plot and character development.  I looked forward every Sunday night to a new episode of Mission Impossible in the late 60s because there were always twists and turns that were rarely predictable.  In the MI movies, it's all stunts and high-tech, no real insight into the people involved.  Plus the iconic music (not just the theme, but the incidental music too) has been relegated to a supporting role, where in the TV series it was almost another character and drove the story forward.  I think the tightness of the hour format on TV forced the writers to curtail extravagance and focus on plot; a two-hour-plus film doesn't have that leanness.  Maybe Mission Impossible 5 should be written as a serial -- 15-minute installments with cliffhanger endings, 10 episodes in all.  I'd definitely go to see that.",1353283200,,952,4.869565217391305

4362689,4,B004EPYZUS,"Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol(released Dec/11)is a heart thumping adrenaline ride and I think is one of the best of the MI franchise so far. The film never stops from start to finish and the cast is simply brilliant:Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt,the IMF team's leader,Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, an IMF technical field agent and part of Hunt's team,Jeremy Renner as William Brandt, IMF Secretary's chief analyst and former IMF field agent,Paula Patton as Jane Carter,a member of Hunt's team,Michael Nyqvist as Kurt Hendricks,a Swedish nuclear strategist,Vladimir Mashkov as Anatoly Sidorov, a Russian intelligence operative following Hunt and his team and others.
The plot finds Ethan in a Russian prison,while an IMF team outside loses some nuclear warhead codes. The film from here revolves around their recovery of those codes and the identity of the man who wants to put the world on the brink of nuclear war. The team frees Ethan and they start to work on getting the identity of the terrorist out of the Kremlin,no less. The mission goes awry and when Ethan is escaping from the Kremlin a gigantic explosion rips away a good portion of it. However during his escape he spotted the man responsible for the bombing,and who will be looking for those all important codes.
The mission has gone sour and Ethan and his team are officially disavowed by their government(Ghost Protocol)and are on their own. Their trail leads them to Dubai,then on to Mumbai,on the trail of the man looking for,getting the codes and trying to reacquire them from him. The team cannot stop the inevitable nuclear warhead launch but Ethan and team do manage to stop the detonation of the warhead on San Francisco,just in the nick of time. The film ends as the team reunites in Seattle,and meets up with Luther(Ving Rhames),who is cleaning up the nuclear warhead mess from the bottom of San Fran Bay. Ghost Protocol has been lifted and the rest of his team agree to go onwards to more missions.
This is truly an excellent film from start to finish. Cruise is on top of his game and his supporting cast is also. It's too bad Ving couldn't have been involved in this one,like the previous three,but the rest of the cast more than made up for his absence. Cruise's climb of the building in Dubai is heart stopping,as all he has between him and a death drop are a pair of suction gloves;one of which gives out part way up.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include two deleted scenes and a look at the gadgetry of the movie and the sandstorm sequence.
This is a totally cool and high speed romp through yet another MI film and one of the best so far. Cruise and company have this down to an art form now,and if they can maintain the consistent quality they have up to this point,I see and long and successful future for this series. Highly Recommended. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1351987200,,2901,4.71259842519685

Climbing (and almost slipping) while hanging from the outside of a tall building...so overdone. Watching Tom Cruise do it, didn't make it any better...no matter how tall the building was supposed to be.

The characters were boring and the storyline contrived. I actually found myself rooting for the far more interesting Bad Girl. The ending was oh-so predictable. Again, nothing special here.

Simon Pegg was a good choice as comic relief and Tom Cruise playing the straight man to him works wonderfully. The addition of Jeremy Renner added to the mix and how he plays off Pegg and Cruise works really good as well, his annalist way of questioning and critiquing everything Cruise does really helps the plot along, and the last piece of the puzzle Paula Patton rounds out the cast really well.

4362778,3,B004EPYZUS,Had some good action scenes. Dragged a little in some spots. Overall not as good as the previous MIP movies.,1351209600,,108,4.45
4362779,5,B004EPYZUS,"I have seen other Mission Impossible movies, but this one is my favorite. Whereas the other movies were slick, flashy, and very orchestrated, this one shows the mistakes during execution and how they were winging it by the seat of their pants. I thought it was different and made the movie much more enjoyable.

I thought the storyline was amazing, very original. Part of the Kremlin gets blown up, the world is on the brink of war..sort of.., and a genius madman is at the center of the plot. A disavowed team of 4 with a limit of supplies and no support must save the world. It was a cool ride from the normality of my life, and I truly appreciated the story.

All of the characters were great. I thought Tom Cruise was very funny, and I really liked Jeremy Renner workout scene before the floating over the fan scene, hilarious. Paula Patton was a fierce fighting femme fatale! I loved her passion in the fight scenes, and Simon Pegg was very funny, also. A great team of actors, and I'm glad I watched it.

I do hope more Mission Impossible movies comes out, and I hope they show refreshing new ideas like they did in this one..

Thanks,
Joy",1350777600,,1145,4.412322274881516

4362781,5,B004EPYZUS,I was worried old Tom would be trying to push the acting too much. Not the case. Great long movie which leaves you at the edge of your seat. Recommend purchase. Throw it in your cart and wait for it to drop.,1350691200,,207,3.9523809523809526

4362833,4,B004EPYZUS,"Finally, an M:I movie that doesn't take itself so seriously. Although the premise is not a humorous one (global destruction), the movie itself and the cast seem more lighthearted thus making it less dark and serious. Simon Pegg pretty much gives any movie he's in a shot in the arm, and Jeremy Renner's acting chops fit in well with the rest of the cast. Sorry we didn't get to see Ving until the end, though. All in all a pretty good flick and the blu ray looks pretty freaking awesome ( especially the shots of Dubai).",1350432000,,520,4.427083333333333

4362842,4,B004EPYZUS,"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.",1349654400,,1341,4.275590551181103
4362883,3,B004EPYZUS,"If you like action, Ghost Protocol is OK. Unfortuantely, Amazon doesn't have many streaming titles. So you're kind of stuck with this.

4362887,4,B004EPYZUS,If a star is nuts enough to do crazy stunts. I could never be paid enough to do that. The movie is action from moment one. Never stops and let you rest.  The plot has many twists and turns that are good enough to keep you watching.  I am sure there will be another one in a year or two. Everyone involved did a great job.,1349481600,,321,3.8484848484848486

4362889,5,B004EPYZUS,I love seeing a movie that most regular people could not make even if they tried. So many movies nowadays seem so low budget that it feels like anyone with a camcorder and a decent dialog could film it. Not this movie! It took you to exotic places around the world and gave you the ride of your life. Loved the exotic feel and the music was nostalgic. Great escape from the mundane!,1349395200,,382,4.2465753424657535

I have a Logitech Revue, and Comcast high speed cable.  There are so many things that can go wrong with downloads, links in the chain, but I don't have this bad a problem with any other services.",1349222400,,334,4.5
4362892,5,B004EPYZUS,"I can't begin to express the overall fun I had watching this film. I would go so far as to say it's my favorite Tom Cruise flick (followed by ""Interview With The Vampire"" and ""The Last Samurai""). It was certainly leaps and bounds over the three previous MI films in terms of action sequences and the overall ""fun"" factor. The supporting cast gels incredibly well and the addition of Jeremy Renner to the team just adds to that ensemble dynamic.

Brad Bird gets a HUGE thumbs up here for his first foray into the live action realm. I've been a big fan of his work (Iron Giant, The Incredibles) and I knew he had great pacing skills...but he's also great at character interaction and dynamics. It's Cruise's movie...but each character in it shines every bit as much as the leading man. Brad Bird is likely responsible for that. The previous films came off as Tom Cruise action vehicles...but Ghost Protocol really is an ensemble piece and plays a lot like ""The Avengers"". As a matter of fact, I enjoyed this one just as much as ""The Avengers"" and, in some aspects, maybe a bit more.

If you're an action/stunt afficionado, this is a must see!! The Dubai tower and Mumbai parking garage sequences stand as some of the finest, if not THE finest, action/stunt sequences it's ever been my pleasure to watch. My only regret is that I didn't have enough foresight to go to a theater to see this in it's initial theatrical run.

The bottom line...

EASILY the most fun I've had watching a film this year.",1349222400,,1495,4.5464684014869885
4362983,3,B004EPYZUS,"Ghost Protocol is another in the series of U.S. government covert action films proving why Hollywood loves a villain.

Perhaps if I had not seen the first three Mission Impossible flicks I would have really enjoyed this one, but compared to its predecessors Ghost Protocol is at best an okay movie.  Don't get me wrong, I've watched the DVD several times, it's fun, I like it.  But it will never be anything more than ""okay"".  Cruise should have stopped while he was ahead.

Still, who knows maybe Mission Impossible 5 will come up with a really dynamite plot, and if not there will always be MI 6 or 7 or . . .",1348963200,,634,4.121951219512195

Why do we have to wait 4-5 years between each one??

I really thought the Ghost Protocol movie would be over-the-top, as a lot of movies late in the franchise are. (Remember the '90's James Bond driving an invisible car?  Bleaach!)

4363372,5,B004EPYZUS,"Am genuinely stunned. Went into this expecting the absolute worst. Cruise has disappointed more often than he's delivered. So when the closing credits rolled - I was speechless. This was absolutely fantastic! Seriously. Just a fun, non-stop, action-pack, well-orchestrated incredible ride. The visual version of a super roller coaster.

Believe me, I'm no fan of the man. His antics and questionable mental state are more than just media fodder, but a genuine concern. This kind of aberrant manic mentality and you half expect to hear some version of a building filled with cots, plastic bags and barrels of special Kool-Aid. But the adage learned a long time ago still applies - you have to separate the artist from the art. If you can't, you'll forever cut yourself off from an expanded world; like intentionally blinding yourself for no other reason than selfish indifference and zealotry.

Opens with a new team, once again recruited to perform missions that are, if not impossible, so close to it as to be defined as suicidal. We pick up the story from the end of the last film. Ethan Hunt is now in a Russian prison, the reason isn't well known and even his fellow agents have only heard rumors and hushed stories; the truth more complicated than they can imagine. But regardless of his crime, IMF needs their best field agent. Their instructions: Rescue Ethan and give him the single most important mission on the table - prevent Russian nuclear launch codes from reaching the hands of a lunatic who wants to employ them in the name of ""peace"".

For this mission he's been assigned two others of complimentary skill sets - technical, linguistics, logistics, and communications. As lead agent, Ethan's job is to secure data from the heart of Russian Intelligence - that's the Kremlin. The equivalent mission would be them stealing into and from CIA Headquarters and The White House combined.

Problem is that their IMF mission isn't the only operation being conducted. A simultaneous effort is being run. And their mission is to destroy the same Kremlin records - by destroying the Kremlin itself.

Yikes.

Guess which team succeeds and which one fails?

Ethan and his group are branded international terrorists and mass murderers. Not only are they cut-off from official sanction and support - the entire dark operation, every single IMF agent regardless of status, is now disavowed. They don't exist, have never existed, and will never be acknowledged. Their only hope is to hide, now and forever.

'Cept of course the movie would end pretty quickly if that's what IMF personnel did when confronted with hopelessness.

Can the team uncover the genuine mission and the true reason why their world has been turned upside-down?

Mucho props to his new mates - Simon Pegg, Paula Patton, and amazingly - fresh from his first stint as Jason Bourne's replacement and the newest Avenger: Jeremy Renner.

It was kind of weird seeing two lead action actors in the same movie. And that's really one of the big reasons this worked so well - the unconventional balance achieved by Cruise by allowing another to share his spotlight. A genuine shocker, it spoke of craft professionalism and a grounded ego. The latter of which I would have never thought to ascribe to the actor. The fresh interplay between the two plays wonderfully and hilariously throughout the film as Ethan recognizes Agent Brandt as his equal.

Finally, I was flabbergasted that this is Director Brad Bird's first major movie with live action. Proof - absolute and incontrovertible - that a good director is a good director regardless of medium. It makes no difference whether you're filming people or moving pieces of computer code around, talent will always be talent. And the multitude of excuses some fans make for ""their"" directors by defending screen failures will always fall on deaf ears to this cinephile.

Movie Notes:

- Utterly fantastic seeing Josh Holloway as an IMF agent! No doubt executive producer J.J. Abrams has fond memories of when they worked together on '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0036EH3WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>'. Regardless of the connection, I thought Josh looked incredible on the silver screen. I'm hoping his brief, but outstanding performance leads to something better for the man. One of the most under-appreciated actors of his generation.",1347062400,,4404,5.141258741258741

What earns this title 5 stars for me is that Paramount opted for CHOICE!  I can choose an iTunes digital copy or Ultraviolet.  I'm also not going to be sucked down into the debate pit about which format is better.  I prefer iTunes but others might like the new Ultraviolet.  Lately, there have been a flotilla of titles that have been Ultraviolet only.  And with the exception of Deathly Hallows, the studios have been unwilling to trade leaving me with a format I can't use.  So, empathy for those who did not want to or could not use iTunes and the only choice available was iTunes.

Bravo Paramount for good customer service!  Let's vote with our dollars and support this kind of product!

4363510,4,B004EPYZUS,"I gotta admit, after failing to mask my disappointment over the two preceding M:I sequels, I was one reluctant hombre to go see MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL.  I mean, how many times can Cruise's Ethan Hunt have such a brooding, endless, pity party?  Yet I'm happy to report this latest installment is grand fun, and in my humble opine is the best film in the franchise.  Here Cruise ratchets down the gloom and doom and allows his fellow spies (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and a stunning Paula Patton) to play off his antics, as the IMF--ostensibly disavowed by the U.S. government--races furiously to prevent a demented terrorist from launching a global nuclear attack.  From the Kremlin, to the Burj Khalifa Tower in Dubai, to the streets of Mumbai, GHOST PROTOCOL is as fast and as furious as running across a blazing hot street barefoot.  In other words, GHOST PROTOCOL gets up and moves.

Cruise is in stellar physical condition, and that's a good thing, because his Ethan Hunt is a whirlwind of kinetic energy; from jumping out of a third floor hospital room, to scaling the Khalifa Tower (more on that later), to driving a car off the top level of a parking garage, Cruise has to rely on his pecs.  And the plot and pacing are just as frantic, making watching this installment a quick view.  Director Brad Bird further enhances the action with eye-popping CGI effects and graphic visuals; this is one finely-crafted action thriller.  The other major players are solid; Renner matches Cruise's physicality, Pegg provides comedy relief, and Patton packs volumes of eye candy.  The rest of the cast is entertaining as well; look for the character actor Tom Wilkinson in a brief, uncredited role.

And with my acute acrophobia, naturally Agent Hunt will be forced to scale the outside of the Khalifa Tower to gain access to the building's nerve center--naturally his high-tech gizmo gloves (with the giant sucking sound) will malfunction while Hunt is more than a 1,000 feet in the desert air.  Watching this (through half-closed eyes) I literally become a contortionist in my seat, twisting and squirming to relieve my discomfort.  Normally in scenes such as this I fast forward through the mayhem, but not here; MISSION:  IMPOSSIBLE--GHOST PROTOCOL is so darn fun I want to watch every blasted second.

The effort to create a really action packed movie, was achieved.  However,  to my opinion, they wasted much of their special effects by including a sand storm in the movie, with the result that for several minutes nothing was seen but dust and sand flying around.  I guess,  I like my movie clean and bright where you can see and enjoy every part of it.

Tom Cruise once again kicks ass, in an intense yet likeable role where we can relate to his character. You feel the anxiety, you cheer him on when he's hurt and just won't give up. You can't help but cheer for the good guys in this one.

The intro is kick ass, worthy of any Bond movie.

The audio and video quality are amazing. I am using a Panasonic BDT320 and Turtle Beach PX5 7.1 surround sound headphones, bought here on Amazon, to play the movie. Suffice it to say it is a first class experience, and worth owning. Sadly I missed it in theaters, but I can enjoy it in full on my own time here at home. No, I didn't buy my Viera plasma on Amazon ;)

***** 5/5 stars

My only gripe is the Paramount Ultraviolet service. It's a confusing setup, having to create and then link 2 separate accounts and then download the movie using a poor interface.
Also, reduced movie quality aside for the download, the movie is currently stored on my hard drive (Windows 7 PC) in 7972 separate files in the folder ""Videos\Paramount\da4ffc18-ae64-482d-aaf9-edf1b1c21753"". All the files have names like ""0a3cb982-3051-4dd5-8ad8-392837e04da4""

WTF?

How about an MP4 or WMV file?

What if I wanted to take it with me on my tablet?

Awesome movie! Worth getting. I paid under $20 for both the Blu-ray and DVD versions. If you love adrenaline, James Bond, Jason Bourne and intelligent action, you'll love this one.",1342656000,,1649,4.562711864406779

4363601,5,B004EPYZUS,"Having seen all the previous Mission Impossible films (and being a fan of both the original and the revised Mission Impossible tv shows); I must say that this last one was most enjoyable.  The action and stunts done were great.  And the suspense (and sort of twist) in the storyline were very refreshing.  It wasn't just bullets, blood, guts, with a little bed-room action thrown in the middle of the plot like some so-called action films tend to be these days. This one has some substance!  Actors didn't OVER act.  Just a fun film.",1342483200,,533,4.627659574468085

4363643,5,B004EPYZUS,"I received a text for a free RedBox rental last night, and swung by the ol' Market Basket to redeem it. There was a pretty lousy selection of available Blu-rays, but this one was there, and I figured I'd check it out. Turned out to be a great choice!

I've seen the first three movies in the series, and they all were relatively forgettable for me... I don't recall much, other than that they were spy movies featuring Tom Cruise. For Ghost Protocol, the series has made a quantum leap in its production. This is the best action movie I've seen in recent memory, and Cruise is one of those actors who seems to get better with age. Rather than be hampered by his reduced physical abilities (which comes naturally in your late 40s, no matter how hard you work out), he somehow appears more athletic and at ease than ever, and his charisma is on full blast, as per the usual.

The audio/video presentation of the disc itself is outstanding, among the best I've seen on Blu-ray. I got sort of queasy  during the Dubai free climbing session, and I was only watching on a 40"" screen... I can only imagine what this must have been like in Imax!

The true beauty of this movie, however, is its excellent pacing. It knows exactly what it is, and what it should be doing at all times. This is not a philosophical movie that will make you think real hard, or challenge your views of the universe. It is simply an action vehicle designed to thrill and entertain, and in that regard, it excels. It moves from one great set piece to the next, with just the right amount of dialogue from the characters to create an attachment with the viewer and maintain the sparse plot. It never takes itself too seriously- at one point, Ethan Hunt even makes fun of his own cliched dialogue with an old ally (fans will enjoy that scene).

Unless if you are really jaded against the film industry, Cruise, or the series, I feel that you will have FUN watching this movie! Best served with friends, loud volume, and a cocktail of your choosing. Peace!",1342396800,,2021,4.451351351351351
4363644,4,B004EPYZUS,I've always held the opinion that as an actor Tom Cruise gives a solid performance. His latest Mission: Impossible is no exception.

4363674,4,B004EPYZUS,"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL delivers exactly what you expect a film of this kind to do--entertain the masses, especially action fans who like all those cool gadgets, all those stunts from high places, and all of the twists in plot that keep the story spinning between each new outburst of violent action.

As usual, the mission is to prevent a nuclear device from destroying and vaporizing an entire population in an exotic locale. This time Ethan Hunt has Benji (Simon Pegg) for comic relief, Paula Patton as Jane Carter for a curvaceous female co-agent, and Jeremy Brenner as the troubled agent who's hiding something until the reveal.

But it's not the plot that really carries the film. It's the outstanding use of picturesque locales combined with the danger of stunts that look amazingly as though nobody could have survived the making of the film. Cruise's spiderman stunt on a high tower glass skyscraper is something to see, as are many of his ""chase and be chased"" stunts.

To enjoy this sort of thing you have to ignore the credibility gaps in the story and simply dwell on the action-filled sequences, some of which look absolutely amazing. The photography is first rate, especially clever at capturing a frantic chase through a sand storm and other such perils that look like a danger to life and limb.

Tom Cruise still looks fit enough to handle most of his stunts and does so with an intensity he always projected as the daring agent. All in all, the film is an example of how to put together an action film with few lulls in its long running time, and one that is sure to please the masses.

One of its saving graces: no shaky camera as in the ""Bourne"" films.",1341619200,,1683,4.672297297297297

I wanted to see more of him, a little more explanation.

Overall, a very fun action film. I definitely recommend at least renting it.

I went to check, and the DVD is heavily scratched. I check out the case, and i saw the Bluray disc. It worked just fine.

Lately, almost 30% of the DVDs i get from amazon, are scratched. This is really weird, because the packaging seems like new, so i cannot understand how this happened.

4363715,4,B004EPYZUS,"This is one of the stronger entries in the Mission Impossible franchise. Things I liked: The plot is coherent. A chase in a sandstorm is one of the more innovative chase scenes I've seen in awhile, surpassed only by a chase in one of those automated European parking garages. The unlikely high tech gear that IMF always uses is subject to unexpected failure in this movie (just like it would be in the real world). Unlike some earlier MI movies, there are welcome elements of humor in this one. Things I didn't like: Not much chemistry between Cruise and Paula Patton. The whole ""crazy guy steals launch codes to set off nuclear Armageddon"" idea is pretty stale. On the whole, there's nothing deep about this movie but it's fun, a good thrill ride for action movie fans.",1340928000,,770,4.627737226277373
4363716,1,B004EPYZUS,"Apparently a lot of people liked this film a lot.  I thought it was lousy, even by the really generous standards of action/adventure films.  It was so hopelessly implausible, it made the James Bond films look like PBS documentaries by comparison.

The bad guy mad scientist got away with stuff that no lone bad guy could get away with; Cruise and his IMF team are supposedly cut off from support (the President has ""disavowed"" them), yet they still have access to trainloads of ultra hi tech gear; and hopelessly arbitrary changes are made, when convenient and throughout the film, regarding previously established plot points.

Dramatically, there is no sense of the IMF team either facing an authentic challenge, or a sense of them earning their victories along the way. The ""ghost protocol"" in this film is the ghost of the writers making outcomes arbitrarily work out in favor of the IMF team, without really presenting imaginative solutions to the problems they do face.

4363720,4,B004EPYZUS,"This high octane action picture stars Tom Cruise in his usual role as Ethan Hunt. It opens with a tech ally (played by Simon Pegg) helping cruise escape from a highly guarded prison in Moscow. What then follows is his team trying to get the launch codes for a bunch of nuclear weapons from a terrorist (played by Michael Nyqvist), who plans to use them to start World War III.

The twists and turns and suprises, as well as the action scenes, are satisfying. Some are believable and some are up for your vote. What did you expect? That's how this series rolls.

My favorite scenes were the early prison break out and the mid fight against the female villain lieutenant's character.

Also starring Anil Kapoor (that old rogue of sorts who was the TV personality in ""Slumdog Millionaires""), Paula Patton, Josh Halloway (a small role and yes that's the guy from LOST), Lea' Seydoux (the female villain lieutenant) and cameos by Michelle Monaghan and Ving Rhames.

This is the fourth installment of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series. Cruise and Pegg are interested in a fifth installment. The budget was $145M and it made over $693M at the Box Office. No chump change here.

4363736,5,B004EPYZUS,"The Mission Impossible series is undoubtedly one of my favorite movie series because, unlike a lot of other movie series out there, they don't make hasty sequels just to rack in some more cash from devote fans (yes, I'm thinking of Transformers right now... much as I hate to say it because I loved the first movie).  Ghost Protocol is actually my favorite movie of the series, a spot which previously belonged to MI3 after it belonged to MI2... This is another oddity as even in many series where the sequels aren't horrible, they still can't beat the first one (ex. Pirates of the Caribbean).

Anyways, on to the movie itself.

Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner both gave amazing performances. I love how the script manages to work in laugh-out-loud moments while still maintaining its serious nature and action that keeps you at the edge of your seat.

While I know that the feats performed are impossible, they managed to lend it an amount of plausibility as things never turn out as planned.  Their technology works only about half the time, plans have to be changed and the new ones inevitably lead to new pitfalls, the team works together but still have reservations about one another.... All in all, I thought it was amazing. The revelation about Jeremy Renner's character was particularly momentous, as his role was primarily comedic up to that point.

The music that was used in the movie enhanced the moments of tension and helped to create the atmosphere of the various foreign locales.  The cinematography was beautiful, and I can't get over the fact that Tom Cruise was actually hanging on the outside of Burj Khalifa (something I learned from the special features on my blu ray disk :P).

My only complaint would be that Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) did not play a larger role in the film. However, as I loved the new cast in this movie, that is not a real disappointment.",1340409600,,1883,4.719512195121951

4363739,2,B004EPYZUS,This movie is an assault on your senses. It's loud. It gives you no rest. It's just one impossible action stunt after another. I had to turn it off.,1340150400,,148,4.137931034482759
4363740,4,B004EPYZUS,"I remember when the first Mission: Impossible movie released. I thought it was fantastic. Great intricate story and spy stuff.

Then the second one came along. It's been a while since I saw that one, but the one thing I remember is constantly wondering who will be wearing a mask, revealing they are not who you think they are. Long story short, it was a dumb movie.

The third movie brought the franchise back, with J.J Abrams at the directing helm. A much improved movie, although it still lacked the fun of the original.

All of that is rectified with Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. Sure, J.J. Abrams still had a role with the movie by producing it, but Brad Bird of Pixar fame was wisely put at the helm to direct. What comes from this is a fun spy movie with a great sense of humor.

From the fantastic opening scene (I won't ruin it for you here) where Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt as he should--a smart spy who makes dangerous choices that are to the point of being humourous--to the very end where a frantic entanglement with the enemy takes place, the movie is a load of fun. It brings it back to the glorious days of the original.

Although, let's be clear. The original movie is still better. This is a close second.

I'm not going to waste this review on telling you the story, as other reviews give plenty of that. I will say that this is a fun movie with great action, spy tactics, and character development. We learn more of Ethan Hunt's character along with the crew he ends up with.

4363802,5,B004EPYZUS,"There are plenty of films turned into franchises in this world whose end results offer lackluster movies that don't make you want to revisit the characters and events unfolding on screen. And then there are movies like this one that make you wish they'd just get on with it and start filming the next one so you could enjoy it just as much.

The film opens with Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt in a prison in Russia. His team breaks him out along with a contact he made in prison only to drop him off and then find out what they're next assignment is. Of course it's a near impossible job for them to pull off but that's what they do. A terrorist has the means to launch a full scale nuclear attack on the world if he gets the launch codes. These codes are locked up in the Kremlin and Hunt and his team, should they decided to accept their mission, is to get hold of the launch codes first.

Of course they accept the mission. Would there be a film any other way? Using disguises and some nifty new tech toys, Hunt and compatriot Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) make their way into the Kremlin only to discover the codes have already been lifted. Not only that, Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) the terrorist, has set a bomb inside the Kremlin that explodes just as Ethan and Benji attempt to escape.

Ethan is knocked out by the bomb and wakes to find himself captive of the police who blame him for the attack. He escapes custody and finds himself picked up by the IMF Secretary (Tom Wilkinson) and his assistant William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). The Secretary tells him he will have to turn him over to the authorities. That is unless he suddenly escapes and heads for a secret train equipped with the tools he'll need to find the real culprits. Of course this mission is off the books and unauthorized which is where the term ghost protocol comes up. Before he can finish, the Secretary is killed in the car and Hunt and Brandt escape to head to the train car where they meet up with Benji and Jane Carter (Paula Patton).

Hunt explains the situation to them and offers them the mission. Yes, they accept and things begin to move forward as the team heads to Dubai where they know Hendricks is about to purchase the last of the equipment he needs to launch his attack. In the famous sky reaching hotel located there the assassin who killed the agent with the original codes (and Carter's boyfriend) is about to make her exchange with Hendricks. But the team has a plan to make con both parties and retrieve the information. Of course things don't go as planned and suddenly we get the chance to see Ethan scaling a glass windowed building in an attempt to over ride the hotel elevators.

So you get the idea here? To give all the rest away would be to spoil what happens and the thrills and spills that the makers of this film obviously worked long and hard to bring together. The details offered so far are nothing more than the set up that makes the action sequences that follow all that more spectacular. They ruin nothing so don't fear that a spoiler alert was needed. Much of that information could have been gleaned from the trailer.

With all the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE films the thing is to get into it, to enjoy it, to toss out any concepts of reality and believability and just have a good time. This film offers a fun time at the movies in spades and will make you tear up at the right times, clench your fists when the bad guys seem to get away with things and make your palms sweat as you watch the team almost blow the whole mission on more than one occasion. On top of that you have two underlying stories fomenting beneath the obvious one that wrap themselves into the main plot and then find themselves resolved before the end.

One of the best things is that the film ends without a clue as to another film being made or even considered but left open enough that should they decide to do one they can. As a fan of all four films this is once when I hope a franchise does continue. The films have all offered great entertainment value and enough mystery to keep you guessing until the end of each.

I waited for the DVD and now wish I had seen the film on the big screen for maximum visual pleasure. Once you look past the unbelievable plot, the movie is fun. The incredible action scenes are the main draw of this film. Agent Ethan Hunt (Ton Cruise) has to climb several storeys of the world's tallest building in Dubai and he has to do it from the outside. Incredible.

One of my favorite actors Simon Pegg adds some comic relief as the technical expert who dreams of higher exploits. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton complete the mission impossible team of 4. The fun of this film is the exotic locales and the spectacular action scenes. Although the film is short on plot, the action takes over. The Americans and the Russians are again at odds but the twist is neither side is the ""bad"" guy. A rogue band of international terrorists implicate the IMF team as perpetrators of a bombing in the Kremlin. It is up to Ethan Hunt and his team to save the world.

It was actually difficult to stay focused on the movie and I found myself drifting into and out of full attention.

The death defying climbing scene outside the skyscraper was neato to watch too. This film is filled with plenty of action for the whole family to watch. It may be too much for little children though. Like 5-10 year olds. That's to be left to your descretion. It's PG-13 but I didn't see anything that would be too much for kids. The kids will probably enjoy it more than the adults will.

4363866,3,B004EPYZUS,"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a rollicking piece of eye candy directed with aplomb by live-action novice Brad Bird, yet it is not without its flaws. Many of the action sequences--including the amazingly inventive and enthralling centerpiece--a risky `secure the macguffin' scene in and around the world's tallest building--absolutely stun. The characters, notably the ever-cheeky Simon Pegg and relative newcomer Jeremy Renner, are highly likable (even Tom Cruise delivers an understated and magnetic performance, despite looking about half-a-year too old for the role). The film is slightly overlong and the plot paper-thin however, which shouldn't be a problem for the adolescent target audience. More or less the objective (should you choose to accept it) is to secure the case. What's in the case? Nuke codes! Why does the villain want them? World domination! Why? Who cares! Can we stop him? Well, we'll sure give it the ol' college try. Boom. Blam. Globe-trotting, fisticuffs, and dandy gadgetry-fueled action sequences ensue. The film is goofy (see the clumsily-animated CGI opening titles), charming (gotta love that theme song, even the tenth time!), and watchable, yet a little too ridiculous from time to time (why does Ethan feel the need to send that car crashing down at the end? Just for the sake of one more explosion?) and overlong by about fifteen minutes. Still, if you are looking for mindless popcorn entertainment, you could do a lot worse. Yes, Michael Bay, I'm looking at you. You could learn a lot from Mr. Bird, who, given a little less puffy of a script, could create great things.

Ghost Protocol is more enjoyable and more human partly because of the comedic relief of Benji (played by Simon Pegg), the tech guy on the MI team. The previous MI movies were too serious--almost no comedic relief. MI-3 was even morbid in the hostage segment that went on too long. This film is better, and includes some great action, stunts, and photography. Especially noteworthy is Tom Cruise climbing, running & jumping around on the glass outside one of Dubai's tallest buildings. There's a short fight scene between two hot females that is intense & authentic. Another fight sequence in an automated parking garage tower is really cool, and nicely choreographed.

I don't even own a Blu-ray player, so the ONLY reason for the purchase was digital copy.

We've all seen digital copy advertised on TV. The commercials make a big deal about how you can watch a movie on your PC, TV, and portable devices. Unfortunately, when I transferred this film to my Android tablet, some kind of copy protect prevents it from playing. Not being very tablet-savvy, I'm kind of at a loss.

Even though the cold war is supposed to be dead this movie creates a fresh approach to international covert wars and keeps you engaged and not bored. The movie keeps jetting you around the glob and wraps it up nicely in the end of course--it is how they do it that you stay aboard to see. The main issue I have with these movies is how ordinary people like Tom Cruise's character, in the current day action and adventure movies, and the like can jump off the side of a building slam themselves into a movie car with with bodies and get up and sprint off--no broken bones or anything. But when someone kicks them right before they get their hands on a gun or nuclear war head deactivation device they are slowed down . . . crippled. It is contrived of course and you feel manipulated. Anyway the only other issue I had with this movie is how it portrays India as a modern country with gleeming streets and skyscrapers etc that a movie is set in while 90% of the country is awash in poverty and disease infested slums.

Was this movie a five?  Nope, but it does rate a strong 4.  I give it credit because Cruise shares the scenes and the action with other stars; a strong female lead is allowed to play an expansive part (and does it well); the field agent turned analyst is well played; and the plots moves along without becoming too bogged down.  Ok, a nuclear missile almost nukes San Francisco and apparently no-one in the world knows that but the IMF team, even though the warhead actually strikes a building and would have been picked up by many radars the world over.

The script was just terrible, if you wanna make a decent movie you have to ask yourself some questions. Is this what would really happen? Is that what this character would do? Is this really what this person would say? These guys just didn't do that. Like at the end of the movie when the bad guy throws himself off the building, brief case in hand, to stop Ethan from getting the case. Couldn't he just have thrown the case? Would a person really launch themselves off along with it, just for dramatic effect? Or if the government had some super secret agency as a last line of defense against nuclear terrorism and biological warfare, would the missions really be optional? I can just imagine the director trying to organize operations. ""Oh no? you don't feel like accepting the mission to stop the nuclear bomb from detonating, OK, I'll see if Johnson wants to do it."" And don't even get me started on the dialog, when Ving Rhames has to make a cameo just to tell you how corny blurting out ""Mission Accomplished"" at the climax of the movie is, that's when you know you got problems.

And it wasn't just that the character's were unrealistic, the whole plot hinged on coincidence after coincidence. ""Oh my god! The terrorists just made off with the nuclear codes, what are we gonna do!?"" ""Don't worry, I happen to know a guy, who knows a guy, who knows where they're going."" Or when Ethan's in the car with the defense secretary and out of nowhere Russian law enforcement unloads on their vehicle with assault rifles. How did they even know where Ethan was, or who was in the car? Or were they just out blasting random vehicles? Maybe things are a little different in Russia, but in North America generally they throw on the blinkers and tell you to pull over first.

Why is it that every time you're on a mission to save the world from nuclear disaster, every piece of equipment you brought breaks, and then a sandstorm rolls in.

The only mission impossible here was the actors trying to make this thing believable.",1337817600,12,2085,4.596774193548387

4364009,2,B004EPYZUS,"(Some minor plot details are revealed below)

It's hard to know who the Mission: Impossible franchise is aimed at any more. On the face of it, this is a children's movie, with very little in terms of plot or character development to give adults anything to get their teeth into. On the other hand, there is a scene right at the start of the movie with an implied kicking to death (off screen, mercifully) of a prison guard, and people being graphically shot multiple times. It's a mark of the skewed moral compass of Hollywood these days that ""foul"" language is not allowed, but extreme violence? That's fine in a PG-13 movie.

A common theme amongst most of the reviews of this film is that you need to ""suspend disbelief"". It is evidently possible to make a thrilling action movie that doesn't insult the intelligence of its viewers - The Bourne Ultimatum is proof of that - so why does Ghost Protocol choose to throw in such flimsy nonsense that requires everyone to forget about basic logic and the laws of physics?

The plot, such is it is, doesn't hold up. Got your top rank movie star? Check. Throw in some exotic locations with no real reason to connect them? Check. Come up with some ridiculously implausible gadgets? Check. Job done! Who cares about a story arc? The central theme of this movie actually may be product placement, so blatant is it. I understand the reasons for product placement, but when it's so comically obvious as it is here, it takes the viewer out of the film. Canon, Dell, Apple, BMW...it's like being bludgeoned by a marketing company.

There are so many silly scenes in this movie, I almost don't know where to begin. How about having a set of characters regroup independently in a central location, then showing that they are all wearing clothes that exactly match the dark grey shade of the walls of the room they're in? What are the chances?! How about another scene with members of the public walking by, who all - gasp! - happen to be wearing clothes that perfectly match the set design colours? Did the director think that people wouldn't notice this kind of thing? How about throwing in a giant sandstorm where people can't see see each other when they're chasing each other on foot...but can have a car chase inside the same sandstorm? Yeah, that works! Or have an item that can be tracked using ""isotopes"" with pinpoint accuracy from a distance of half a mile away...no matter, let's just assume that the audience is stupid, get the characters to mutter some mumbo jumbo, no-one will notice, right?

The character writing is also paper thin. Simon Pegg's character is a Mr. Bean type moron - obviously he's there for comic relief, but it stretches credibility to breaking point when a bumbling twit is supposed to be part of the world's most highly trained secret agent team.

Even the CGI work is often sub-par, with the CGI elements standing out like a sore thumb on a number of occasions - the camera pass over the tall building in Dubai where much of the central action takes place (the building itself is a hugely obvious render), water surface effects that look like they've come out of a computer game circa 2002, a dropped aluminium suitcase that's about as convincing as a singing goat.

Having said all that, Ghost Protocol is not completely without merit. The scene featuring the approach of a giant sandstorm is genuinely tense, even if that tension disappears when it actually arrives. The climbing of the Burj Khalifa is very well handled. The problem is, the good parts are thinly dispersed amongst the bits that require a monumental suspension not just of disbelief, but of one's entire brain...and you know what? I'm done with suspending this much disbelief.",1337644800,,3719,4.712307692307692

He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry.

Yet, despite how anxious I was to view this movie, (I streamed it in VuDu's HDX, before it was available to me on disc) I was surprisingly disappointed.

Being a true fan of the original TV series, I was glad to see that the movie renditions did no disrespect to either its originality - or the great characters created and portrayed so well by the former actors. But unlike MI 1 or 3 - GP seemed to really bomb out and defined rock bottom - IMHO.

Unlike the predecessors, great ""true-to-form"" MI creativity always tightly integrated into an intelligent storyline, seemed to be rather ""cheaply replaced"" by repeated overdoses of over-the-top stunts and special effects.

I enjoy the innovative technological aspects typical of MI in general - and honestly, the Blu-ray transfer, audio tracks, and over-all production quality for this one were also quite good.

Cruise didn't really have much going on emotionally, other than looking 20 years younger than he really is (I think I may need to check out this Scientology thing!).  Which left me watching a bunch of really big, cool set pieces, stunts and effects, but with no really emotional engagement.

Problems:
(1.) The first noticeable problem was the dialogue. Another example of Hollywood writers who either have no clue about what they are writing about or have spent too much time watching movies. Simplistic, formula driven for each character; just a lot of jabberwocky ""dumb speak"".
(2.) Stereotypic portrayals of Eastern European bad guys; a not believable attractive female co-spy; a nerdy and goofy computer geek co-spy; the usual prisoners with tats and dumb guards; one African-American in stereotypic spot role; and all the rest of the formula roles.
(3.) Non creative redux storyline of agent who has supposedly lost his wife; then goes rogue; then loses his immediate superior as only contact with agency; usual ""Russian nuclear launch codes.""; usual atomic bombs; usual satellite manipulation; usual computer and security hacking.
(4.) A way to heavy reliance on over the top high tech gadgets that were not believable; just laughable and bizarre toys.
(5.) More over the top action scenes that were reminiscent of a child's style game of one-upmanship e.g. grabbing a falling person by the arm (not possible) isn't the usual 13 stories but we'll show it happening at 130 stories. Just too fakey. A car chase scene that French film producers would just laugh at. Prison breakout looked cartoonish with prisoners beating on each other and the guards.

It's been a while since a great pure actioner or spy film has been released, the last ones being Casino Royale, Mi3 and Bourne 3(superhero movies/crime films notwithstanding).  The next 15 contain what every Mission Impossible movie always has: the infiltration. The scene is even better than the Vatican sequence in Mi3. After that, you get some action, and the plot thickens, and meet the fourth member of the leading team. Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton come in the beginning. Then comes Jeremy Renner. After the first 45 minutes, the movie becomes all about their team. They are all fantastic. Renner is great, and has some cool action scenes. Pegg occasionally steals the show. Patton is solid and looks hot. Cruise does very well, and his stunts are incredible. The Burjh Kalifa sequence is just applause worthy. You guys can hate on him all you want behind your computers, but will you ever have the guts to do something crazy like Cruise? He's a solid actor as well. However, kudos to director Brad Bird. From the opening, to the bombing of the Kremlin, avoiding bullets in a lake, every scene in Dubai, and the epic conclusion, the direction is consistent. The action keeps getting better(excluding the climb, that is meant to be the best part). The fights and chases are just so fantastic. The scene in Mumbai in the automated car garage(I guess?) is just so creative. This movie is filled with non stop thrills. The only flaw is that the story isn't a story, just a plot device. But with incredible action, great teamwork and solid acting, this is the movie to buy on Bluray!

P.S.- the 1 star reviews and much of the two star reviews are BS. They hate on Tom Cruise and disguise the hate by trashing the film. Yes, this is a straightforward action film.

All in all a great film ALOT of fun, not disappointing in the least and always expect the unexpcted from Mission Impossible films, this message will self destruct...",1336348800,,674,4.357142857142857
4364128,4,B004EPYZUS,"I have enjoyed Mission Impossible since it was a TV series many years ago and the movies with Tom Cruise have been action thrillers.  The most recent movie Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol has added more comedy and I must say I enjoyed it even more. Simon Pegg was a good choice to add to the MI team.  He can be serious or add comedy to lighten up the mood. My wife, that hasn't cared to review the previous versions, actually said she wouldn't mind seeing this one again.  As always should you accept to watch this movie you should expect lots of action and plenty of stunts.  Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton know how to act and pull off some great scenes. All the cast played their parts very well but Cruise and Pegg will definitely make you want to see it more than once.

Spoiler Alert: The story centers around a nuclear terrorist that wants to have a controlled nuclear war to weed out the less fit so that we may improve the natural selection.  In other words another insane arms dealer at least a couple bricks short of a load.  It's too bad they kill off Josh Holloway (Lost) as I think he would have made a good asset to the MI team.  Or is he really dead or just badly injured?  Anythings possible in the movies even if you get six bullets to the chest from a female assassin.  Is Tom's MI wife really dead?  You'll have to see it to the end to know for sure.  Only a few things are certain besides death and taxes when it comes to Mission Impossible. You'll see incredible choreographed stunts, excellent impersonations, hear the Mission Impossible theme, and see a lit fuse before the credits.

Bad idea. The effects and the action and the gadgets are all great; it's when the actors stop shooting and start talking that you realize that every non-action bit of the movie is sub-par window dressing. The only bright spot in this movie is Simon Pegg, but he doesn't do enough to warrant spending any money at all to see it.

4364153,4,B004EPYZUS,"The Blu-ray edition on MI: Ghost Protocol is a visual spectacle.  It takes a fantastic and well executed film and makes it look and sound as spectacular as it did in the theater.  IMHO, this is the best installment of the series.  MI 1 was good, not great, especially wiith its destruction of the Jim Phelps character.  MI 2 was the better of the films with the less convoluted plot, tighter storyline and great action.  MI 3 was the weakest ans what I thought would be the final entry in the seriers.  Thankfully, Cruise and his production company decided otherwise.

Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, and finds himself paired with a new team of operatives as he tries to prevent global nuclear war.  The action sequences are top notch, and Cruise handles the part well.  He sells Hunt and the issues that drive him convincingly. This story is also the best in terms of well rounded and fully developed stories.  Cruise also displays an easy chemistry with his new team, particularly Paula Patton.  If there is a fifth installment tot the franchise, which Cruise is still young enough to effectively pull off, I hope the new team and Ving Rhames are on board.",1336262400,,1160,4.637254901960785
4364154,4,B004EPYZUS,"""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" is  a lot more fun than ""Mission Impossible III""s wobbly camera and humorless script. Over-the-top action flicks shouldn't take themselves so seriously. This one hits the right balance between suspense and levity. IMF super-agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is incarcerated in Russia for reasons that are unclear -even to the team who springs him. After agents Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and technical specialist Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) free Hunt, the trio is joined by defense analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Their mission is to infiltrate the Kremlin in search of the identity of a rogue Swedish nuclear strategist now believed to be a terrorist code-named ""Cobalt"" (Michael Nyqvist). But the team is in for a big surprise that causes the US to disavow IMF and the Russians to hunt them down, led by security agent Anatoly Sidorov (Vladamir Mashkov).

In today's intimately interconnected world, it's difficult to find palpably exotic locations. ""Ghost Protocol"" takes us to Mumbai and Dubai, where Ethan Hunt performs death-defying stunts hanging from the famous Khalifa Tower. He crawls up the world's tallest building in the world using sticky gloves -which is kind of funny. And it's meant to be. The filmmakers often poke fun at the ridiculously high-tech equipment that the IMF team uses, as it tends to malfunction or simply be impractical. I was annoyed by Agent Dunn's persistent attempts at humor, but the film does some good-natured mocking of itself. It reminds me of an early James Bond film in its high-tech gadgetry and mad genius supervillain. Dunn is a kind of goofy version of Q. I did not particularly like the IMF team, but Tom Cruise brings an all-American charisma to his role, and the action gets the adrenaline pumping.",1336089600,,1786,5.113013698630137

I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise the person, but his characters always deliver. Ethan Hunt is a super-spy, always thinking on his feet and inspiring his team to push beyond their limitations.

This was my first time using Amazon Prime. I have a Netflix account and occasionally rent a movie through my AppleTV.  With both of those services, I have never experienced any problems with the quality of HD streaming, unless they were directly related to issues on my home network. Yesterday, my internet connection was rock solid and at full speed (20mb down / 5mb up), and my local network was up and running smoothly. In spite of that, connection to the Amazon server dropped app. 5 mins. into the movie. This was fixed by restarting the Amazon application on the PS3; the movie continued where it had left off, and in HD quality. However, throughout the 2+hrs. of the film, I noticed that the picture appeared to be frequently and annoyingly stuttering, especially in rapid action scenes. My very nice 50"" Bravia runs at 120hz, and I have thus far not experienced a stuttering picture from any other stream or local source.

So at this point, I'm not too sure about the quality of the Amazon streaming service. I'll probably rent a few more movies to see how it goes, and if the problems recur, I'll just stick with iTunes.",1336003200,,1404,4.541501976284585

4364186,5,B004EPYZUS,"I have not been a fan of the Mission: Impossible films starring Tom Cruise, it has nothing to do with Cruise, who is a fine movie star, but that the overbaked storielines and outlandish special effects have always made them seem more mission improbable to me. However, after sitting through three uneventful films, all from first rate directors who seemed to be following studio direction rather than their own exceptional creative skills, I was seriously surprised to actually enjoy the latest installment. It is every pit as preposterous as every other entry in the franchise, but this one has a sharper wit and brighter intellectual integrity. In no way due I mean that this is a brainy film, that just wouldn't work for this sort of series, but it doesn't insult the viewer's intelligence like some of the previous offenders in the ongoing movie franchise.

The set up is fast and exciting, with a more authentic feel to it, the first noticeable CGI effects don't rear there facial head until thirty minutes into the story. The set up is as a thriller, the pay off is an adventure. Globe trotting from the Kremlin to Dubai to Mumbai, with an amicable cast of colorful characters played by likable actors. Cruise, as I've already stated is a great movie star, his charisma and screen presance help to make him one of the last remaining classical film stars. The supporting cast is equally strong with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hurt-Locker/dp/B00275EGWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hurt Locker</a>&nbsp;star Jeremy Renner nearly stealing the film in a role that is said to be an enventural replacement for Cruise's Ethan Hunt. Simon Pegg is stronger in this entry than he was in the previous film, using a light comic touch, instead of his more broad approach. Sweedish actor Michael Nyquist, best known to American audiences as the original Mikael Blomkvist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Tattoo-Trilogy-Extended-Edition/dp/B005JTLTI4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition</a>, makes a good villain, looking like a cross between Mitt Romney and Robert Vaughan. Tom Wilkinson has a rather pointless guest appearance, still he's the type of solid character actor that lends class and durability to anything, and it's good to see him.

Director Brad Bird, best known for his excellent work for Pixar, makes his live action directorial debut. He comes out with all the visual stops and delivers where previous directors (De Palma, Woo, Abrahms) failed in the past, stunts and action carry this picture, not computer graphics. Just look at the incredible, breathless thrills of Cruise climbing up the side of the Giorgio Armani Hotel Dubai, no stuntmen where used, no CGI cheats, that is Tom Cruise risking his life for the enjoyment of a paying audience. Electrifying editing by Paul Hirsch, who's credits include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Trilogy-A-New-Hope-The-Empire-Strikes-Back-Return-of-the-Jedi-Widescreen-Edition-with-Bonus-Disc/dp/B00003CXCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars Trilogy (A New Hope / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi) (Widescreen Edition with Bonus Disc)</a>&nbsp;and nearly all of Brian De Palma's films, and exhilarating cinematography from Robert Elswit keep the pace and visuals steadfast and exuberant.

I left this movie feeling joyed in the same way the best James Bond films or Indiana Jones adventures have left me feeling in the past. The only obvious fault I can find is that the plot is a tad bit overly familiar, but by being the fourth in a franchise it would seem only natural. This is a step up from the usual big budget blockbusters Hollywood dumps on the unsuspecting moviegoers around the holidays (it was originally released around Christmas). I saw this with my father and sister, which I have to be honest, they did not find it as stimulating as I did. While their reaction was positive, it wasn't as overtly enthusiastic as mine was. I will look forward to the next entry in the series, a first for me and like the recent Fast and the Furious movies and Resident Evil, maybe this franchise has found it's footing once more.",1335830400,,4281,5.5628834355828225

In fact, Tom Cruise and Director Brad Bird have created such an action packed spectacle with this movie that it made what was just over two hours of movie seem like like only an hour. Seriously...the action never slows down in MI Ghost Protocol that has Cruise and his gang out to stop some nut that wants to start a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution.

While breaks in the action are few and far between, you do have to check reality at the door for this movie. Most of the stunts in MI Ghost Protocol are death defying and awesome to watch. But there were several where I was saying out loud ""Yeah, right!"" or ""Oh, c'mon!"" But all in a fun way. The entire movie is exactly that: Fun. Simon Pegg is back and adds his element of humor. The rest of Cruise's team is balanced out with Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton, and the group gels well together and have great chemistry on the screen.

And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some of the gadgets: bionic contact lenses, gloves that stick to any surface, and a BMW with a touchscreen interface integrated into the windshield. Man, it was worth the price of admission just to see those three things in action.

Like having an explosion go off directly under you and waking up just a little groggy.  Or running along the outside of a building on a length of computer cable and then letting go to fly through a window 60 feet away and two stories below, and coming out of it just a little sore and out of breath.  Or driving a car off a cliff and surviving the 10-story impact because of the airbag.  Or jumping out of a moving car at 70mph and getting up just slightly out of breath with scuffed-up clothing.  This movie is guilty of some of the most ridiculous IMP I have ever seen, right down to the pathetically ubiquitous outrunning of bullets and explosions, and it just keeps coming, over and head-shakingly over.

This film is just absolutely, perfectly and consistently ridiculous from start to finish, with eye-poppingly preposterous action and story, from the ridiculous opening to the farcical finish.  If you love mindless Hollywood action, this luxurious, globe-trotting mash of style and tech and beauty and hot hot action will just knock yer socks off.

But given this story, I almost feel sorry for him . . . and for the millions he and the producers (Tom Cruise, whaddaya know) made from this thing.

The story is contrived to fit around action set pieces, with the IMP necessarily inconsistent from scene to scene.  Apparently there are no police or local security forces anywhere these guys go, they're just nowhere to be seen.

A public figure openly expounds the need for global thermonuclear warfare for years, and clearly sets out to make it a reality, and none of the governments of the world take action?  Really?

The IMF mission brief in a public payphone, right out in the open?  Really?  Little Tom Cruise, MMA n' all, takes on 40-odd cons in a Russian prison, and is just fine?  Really?  Cruise the known spy kept in just a normal Russian peneteniary, really? Our heroic team of four spy-biz pros have to go through all kinds of gyrations--with a prep time of 4  hours--to penetrate the Kremlin's most secure spaces, but the bad guy walks in out all by himself, in a smart tweed suit?  Really?  And the Kremlin blows up quite spectacularly; how many hours labor of how many people did that take to set up?  And the Russians didn't detect any of this?  Really?

And now that the bad guy has nuclear launch codes for Russian missiles, the Russians don't just supersede the entire release and authentication scheme (like they--and we--have been doing routinely for more than 60 years), rendering his theft completely useless?  Really?  There's only one set of launch codes for Russia's nuclear weapons.  Really?

A Russian train car packed with electronics and communications gear and weapons?  With an external digital keypad and retina scanner?  That is never discovered as it travels the railways of Russia?  Really?

Penetrating a ridiculously situated server room with some kind of movie-sci-fi magnetic levitation gadget to beat the room's airplane-turbine cooling system.  Really?  Aren't these servers tended by, say, humans, who might use a door?  And using a super-powerful magnet to awesomely levitate the agent, in close proximity to the computers you're going to seize to control the satellite.  Really?  Massive magnets and computers . . . who wrote this stuff?

And lots of ham-handed product placement. But high-end products, so it's okay.  I know now that the most popular vehicles in Russia, Dubai and India are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BMWs/dp/B005C1V64G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BMWs</a>.

Subtle.

In the end the only thing saving this film from a single star was the location shooting.  Going to Russia, Dubai and India is classy filmmaking.

Bottom line: It all succeeds because the core audience demographic is too thick to see the massive plot holes and made-up science.  It's blinky lights and pretty colors, and it's oh so mesmerizing, such a great way to drop $15, get some popcorn and a Butterfinger, and waste a coupla hours.",1335657600,5,4819,5.282894736842105
4364208,5,B004EPYZUS,"Based on the other MI films I was expecting to enjoy this, but it surpassed my expectations. The stunts, writing, humor, filming and performances were all top-notch. The film managed to poke fun at itself, and at the MI genre, in an affectionate way without becoming a spoof, so we could still take the action seriously. Cruise is in top form here, and his supporting cast holds their own. As for the stunts and filming, these are the best I've seen in an action film in awhile, mostly because they are a cut above in terms of creativity. Shots of Cruise scaling the 'tallest building in the world' in Dubai, or trying to trick a guard at the Kremlin, are innovative and perfectly shot. The story is not terribly original, but that's not the reason to see this film. I'm not always an action-film kind of gal, but I think this one is worth it.",1335657600,,843,4.445161290322581
4364209,4,B004EPYZUS,"I loved the first MI, which warped the TV program with Jim Phelps' true character coming out as a total surprise that kept you guessing till the end and yet can be watched over and over.  2 and 3 essentially made Cruise into a superhero, creating a role he could plod through with as much interest as a clod.  While he is still somewhat of a superhero for this one, there is no question that it is best since 1.

Released from prison by a lovely agent, Hunt is immediately entrapped in some kind of web he has to figure out.  The entire MI force is disavowed, so he has no resources but those of his immediate team, which includes a new techie, a mysterious diplomat, and the tough chick.  It is a rollicking good ride and I will definitely buy it once the price falls.  The feats are just believable enough, things keep going wrong, and it is more complicated (yet ever so close) to disaster.  I was not bored for a minute, never lapsed into ""some guy is just making this up"" mode, and wondered what was really going on for most of it.  That is success.

Renner's character was a waste of his serious talent, and the computer geek and the girl were the same 2 generic characters you've seen in a million movies.

The writing was very thin for a movie of this proportion. The action was there, the technology was impressive, the acting was fine, but nothing interesting and compelling was happening. The wheels were turning, but the car wasn't moving.

It was ""formula"" Hollywood movie making.
Handsome leading man...check.
Handsome popular costar (Renner)...check.
Geeky, witty sidekick...check.
Attractive female sidekick........who is also a martial arts expert who can destroy men twice her size......check.
This was Hollywood at its worst. Yes, the technology and effects, Hollywood's strength, were outstanding, but to no avail.

Another gripe - we never got to know, and hate, the bad guy. He was just this distant, uninteresting character who was never really developed. This is the same actor who was outstanding in the European version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

In the end it got cheesy and I even rolled my eyes a few times. This was not a terrible movie, but considering the 2 big actors, and the budget this movie would have had, it should have been much ""smarter"" and more compelling than it actually was.",1335571200,6,1413,5.051502145922747

I mean, they should have made it more cerebral and less physical, but the seemed to have gone in the opposite direction, like they would with a *rising* action star, and not Tom Cruise.

If you liked the movie the blu ray is definitely the way to go.  Top quality here.
The video looks great with a very sharp, clear, and deep picture with only a scene or two of light fuzz.  I would give video a 9/10.  The audio work is amazing as well.  The dialogue comes in crystal clear and the there are quite a few moments in the movie that gives your bass a workout.  The audio direction is fantastic.  Just listen when tom is chasing the bad guy through the sandstorm.  That really stood out to me. A 10/10 for me for the audio.
I can't really say that I was impressed with the amount of special features that the movie offers, however.  There are only a few features that explain a bit on how different parts of the movie were made.  What is here, however is quite good and interesting to watch if you're a fan of the movie.  I just wanted more.  I didn't find a commentary track either which bummed me out.
In short, I would recommend this blu ray to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  It has an amazing audio/video presentation that is worth owning.  I just wish it had more features.",1335398400,2,1252,4.317596566523605

4364256,4,B004EPYZUS,"This review may contain some spoilers about the movie.

After a bombing of the Kremlin brands the IMF agency as terrorists, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team of operatives (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton)go on a secret mission to clear their agency's name, by attempting to thwart a plot to start a nuclear war. During the mission, Ethan will have to escape a prison, chase down a villain during a sandstorm, scale the Burj Khalifa, and fight a crazy Russian guy inside of an epic parking garage.

This is definitely my favorite MI movie. It's loaded with amazing action sequences, but still has a gripping story. The visuals will leave you breathless, I mean, the scene where Tom Cruise is climbing up the Burj Khalifa makes you feel like you are there. When the camera looks down, and you see how far up he is, you get butterflies in your stomach. I especially liked the fight in the parking garage; it was definitely a great location for an action flick like this.

Yet again, the cars are awesome. In Mission Impossible 3, it was the Lamborghini Gallardo, in this movie it's the 2014 BMW i8, which is insanely nice. There is also a good amount of comedy in this movie. Most of it provided by the always hilarious Simon Pegg. And as I mentioned before, even though there is a lot of action, it isn't mindless; there's a good story to it. It's thrilling and will have you at the edge of your seat the whole time. And if you thought they had forgotten all about Ethan Hunt's wife from the last movie, then you would be wrong, very wrong. They don't make up a stupid story to leave her out at all. Just watch :)

The only part I didn't really like because I guess it made no sense at all was when (WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS) the Russian guy jumps off of the ramp in the garage, smashes his face into the windshield of a car, and then proceeds to plummet like 30 feet into the ground. And he is still stinking alive! I know most of the things in this movie aren't things that would ever happen, but, come on. The guy would be almost dead after crashing into the windshield of a car that far up, and then when he reaches the point of hitting the ground he would REALLY be dead. (END OF MAJOR SPOILERS) That's obviously not plausible, but I'm willing to overlook it being that the rest of the movie was fantastic.

Now the DVD and case itself. The case is obviously just like any other Blu-ray cases. But the one I purchased comes with the Blu-ray version of the movie with special features, the regular DVD version, and a digital copy for download. Special features include some nice deleted scenes and an alternate opening. All of that is great and I suggest getting this version.

Overall, almost everything about this movie is awesome, and the two-disc Blu-ray version is the way to go.  This is the best mission yet!

Pros: Great action, but not mindless. Good comedy, gripping story. Nice special features. Best MI ever.

Cons: An unrealistic scene that made no sense because of the outcome. That's just a personal gripe of mine that I'll overlook.",1335312000,2,3064,4.48653500897666

1. The bad guy is boring.  He needed 1-2 more scenes where we see what motivates him or why we are interested in him.  All we get is a 10 second news clip.

2. Too much technology.  Every building they park next to, whether it's an international military installation or a library, they hack into and take over (elevators, etc) in two seconds.

3. *** SPOILER ***

The hotel scene is so elaborate and tense, but they wrote it too lazily:  It litterally would have made no difference if the team was not there at all.  They should have just murdered the bad guys as they walked out of the finished meeting.

4. *** SPOILER ***

Once Renner holds the launch codes to dozens of nukes and threatens to destroy them.  This is a great idea: Keep dozens of nukes out of terrorists' hands.  Tom Cruise says he would rather give the bad guys the nuke codes -- WHICH THEY ACTUALLY USE TO LAUNCH A NUKE AT THE USA -- because he wants to catch the bad guy.

This time around Ethan Hunt (Cruise), along with his team (Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton) find their backs against the wall big time as IMF is disavowed by the government and a new villain (Michael Nyqvist of the overseas The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series) arises with intentions of global nuclear holocaust.  Relentless in terms of its action, Ghost Protocol is the live-action debut of Pixar's Brad Bird, and he brings the same brand of manic energy to the live action realm that he did in the world of animation.

Somewhere between James Bond and Jason Bourne is Ethan Hunt and his IMF Team keeping the world safe from mad men with diabolical plans.  The Mission: Impossible franchise has run the gauntlet as far as successes and failures go; I thoroughly enjoy the original Mission: Impossible, I despise the sequel, and I'm relatively indifferent to the third film aside from its fantastic villain in the form of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The franchise returns to the screen five years after M:I-3 and an entire fifteen years after the original hit theaters in May of 1996.  After the somewhat disappointing box office returns for M:I-3 and the lackluster performance of Cruise's Knight and Day there was talk of Tom Cruises's days as an action star being over.  Ghost Protocol proved to be just the boost Cruise's career needed as M:I-4 went on to be the most successful film in the franchise so far.

Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol isn't my favorite film of the franchise but it is certainly the best of the sequels.

While Ghost Protocol is a relatively good film where it really gets to shine is on Blu-ray. It is simply put one of the best demo discs you can add to your collection as it is as close to video and audio perfection as you're about to find.  I can't find one technical flaw with picture quality.  Black levels are inky across the board, flesh tones are accurate, and I spotted no instances of edge enhancement or artifacting even during the tricky sand storm sequence which could have been a disaster.

My only gripe with the video presentation of M:I-4 has nothing to do with the actual disc released, which again is fabulous, but concerns the fact that there isn't even an option to purchase a version of Ghost Protocol that includes the astonishing IMAX footage.  After the success of releasing The Dark Knight, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Tron: Legacy with their IMAX footage intact I'm dumbfounded by the studio and director Brad Bird's decision not to at least give fans a choice to purchase an IMAX version.  The advertising for the theatrical release of Ghost Protocol leaned heavily on the IMAX footage angle and received a lot of praise critically especially for the Burj Khalifa tower sequence which was edge gripping to say the least.  The lack of IMAX footage obviously didn't affect my score of Ghost Protocol but it's still disappointing that the nearly 30 minutes of IMAX footage was unceremoniously left out.

Like the video transfer the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is also demo worthy.  From as soon as the Paramount mountain disappears the audio assault begins; gun shots, explosions, car crashes, and everything in between will give your surround speakers and subwoofer a real workout.  Not only does the track come alive during the many action sequences but even during the calmer moments the track is full of subtlety and precision.  The revamped theme sounds better than ever, the Dubai dust storm is an auditory tour de force, and the fight scenes pack plenty of punch no pun intended.  Even with all the action the dialogue is always crystal clear and the front sound stage is well balanced.  Ghost Protocol simply sounds amazing; even with the volume turned up high it never gets out of control and you shouldn't have to fidget with the volume level at all.

The special features included on this release are a little light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.  An UltraViolet Digital Copy & a normal Digital Copy are also housed on the DVD copy.  Four  HD documentaries of varying length are included; Heating Up in Dubai (17 min), Vancouver Fisticuffs (12 min), The Sandstorm (3 min), and Props (3 min).  Also included are 15 minutes of Deleted Scenes with optional commentary with Director Brad Bird also presented in HD.  Strangely there is no feature commentary with Brad Bird which seems like a glaring omission.

This newest entry into the Mission: Impossible franchise is the best film of the franchise since the original but is easily the best Blu-ray of the series.  The included special features are a little light but that can be overlooked because of the amazing video and audio presentation which is flawless.  Inclusion of the IMAX footage would have been a nice bonus; I simply don't understand why it wasn't included but perhaps a future Blu-ray release will include it.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enjoy Tom Cruise's best film in almost a decade before he ""self destructs"" again.",1335052800,,5060,4.861305361305361

Agents and terrorists are not only able to steal the Russian launch codes for their missiles they also steal a launch control briefcase to use to get it done. One set of terrorists have the codes and the mastermind evil scientist has the box. They simply have to get together and make a deal.

The plan is simple! Break Ethan Hunt out of a high tech maximum security prison and get the codes back. While the IMF team is tasked to retrieve data out of the Kremlin (Of all places) that will help get the codes back, a mastermind terrorist steals the control box and blows up the Kremlin.

Only the IMF team knows who really did it and that the world is danger of being destroyed by a nuclear war! Ethan Hunt and his team embark on a worldwide hunt to find the villains and stop Armageddon....

This movie is non-stop action with a high tech plot that holds your interest. The action and stunt scenes are top notch and many are breathtaking to view. The storyline about the IMF team is thought-provoking as there are mistrusts and hidden secrets that have to be put aside to save the world.

This is one of the best high action films of the year and it is acted well and the script is tight and interesting. I recommend this movie to you.",1335052800,,1487,4.380434782608695

The Movie- 5 Stars
This movie has a ton of ""hands-down"" moments. Among them:
- Probably one of the best pure action movies I have ever seen. Yes, the plot is silly, but this is not a movie you walk into expecting it to change your perspective on life. It's just a fun and exciting movie which puts a very nice spin on the tired franchise with the Murphy's Law conundrums. Part of the fun is watching how Tom Cruise and team find their way around everything that the plot throws at them. One of my favorite sequences in MI3 was the Italy scenes where a daring heist is carried off flawlessly. In this movie, you have tons of heist scenes where absolutely nothing goes right and the movie still manages to find that tricky signature balance between action/plausibility/humor that carries the viewer from scene to scene with bated breath.

- Direction/editing was first-rate. Brad Bird really has the chops to carry this off and I look forward to his next big screen popcorn pleaser.

- Acting. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY runs like Tom Cruise. Despite his tarnished public image, Cruise proves once again why he is the king of action movies. His intensity and star mega power is on full display here and his physical investment is right up there on the screen. He is nicely matched with the supporting cast---Paula Patton is the feminine charm (and how nice it is to see an actress who is not a 20 year old stick and is believable being super sexy and kicking butt!), Simon Pegg is used in just the right amounts and Jeremy Renner is adequate in his role as well, though I am not sure if he can match Cruise on pure charisma if the plan is to have him take over the series someday. He does have amazing arm veins though.

- The Imax scenes in the theatre were jaw-dropping and perfectly blended into the regular scenes. And this leads me to my complaints.

The Blu-Ray Disc- 3 stars
I cannot emphasize how incredibly disappointed I was that these Imax scenes were not presented in the disc.

I have no idea why they skimped out on this, but those panoramic sweeping vista moments were a key highlight to this movie. The opening scenes in Prague set the stage, the Dubai scenes contributed to that sense of vertigo and epic stomach churning anxiety. Why would they not include these on the Blu Ray?

""The Dark Knight"" Blu Ray, still my favorite disc, proved you can do this well for the home audience. When I ordered MI4, I was most looking forward to seeing those Imax scenes again and was extremely disappointed they were not included. And yes, that was enough to dock 2 stars for me, despite the movie's excellence.

Do I regret this purchase? Yeah, I kinda do. I am super picky with my Blu Ray purchases because I went a little nuts purchasing 100's of DVD's and promised myself only to buy Blu Rays which were superlative. I was really hoping this would be one of them and I feel a bit cheated because in my opinion, this was not the whole movie. Those Imax scenes were a labor of love to shoot and specifically part of Brad Bird's vision and it is a huge disservice to have not included them.

ETA: I actually did a little research as to why Brad Bird did not include the 16:9 aspect ratio to accommodate the Imax scenes...apparently, this was so that there would be no impact on people who have constant height projection systems. Again, this was Mr. Bird's choice and I guess I have to respect it.
One more thing I did want to add which I did not mention in my review---the Blu Ray itself *is* pretty incredible in both picture and sound. Really great quality. My only nitpick was the exclusion of 16:9 aspect Imax scenes, which even though there is now a real reason for it, I wish were still included as an extra.",1335052800,133,3855,4.447592067988668
4364272,2,B004EPYZUS,"The movie was awesome, however I have one real big head-scratcher for the Director... Dude, you invested all this time and care into producing some fantastic sequences utilizing the IMAX format, but you chose to leave the cropped theatrical aspect ratio throughout the entire film and depriving the viewers who bought the HD Blu-Ray format of the extra glorious expanded IMAX shots.  What the hell were you thinking there?  I'd call this a technical problem that should be fixed and replaced free to Blu-Ray owners.  Major downgrade in my rating for that to an otherwise cool film.

Christopher Nolan at least the right idea for The Dark Knight Blu-Ray release.  What's the point of using the technology if you're not going to show it in all its glory?",1335052800,2,752,4.84375

This one has none of these. It was even worse than the over-the-top John Woo-directed installment. Brad Byrd seemed as interested in getting laughs all the way through as in creating a compelling movie. Instead he creates a terrible cheese of a movie with cheap laughs and zero compelling elements.

After all the great action and suspense in the last MI movie and the great reviews I heard and the money it made I just knew this was a sure hit. Even the title is very cool. But what I watched lacked a reasonable plot had zero suspense. The action was not even that great and the bad guy came off as some crazy fool who's ideas made little sense and was not explained at all.

The actors were just as poor the girl on the team should have kept her part on Law and Order SVU. I hope they never let her do another MI movie. And I hope the other guy that was an agent does a btter job brining something to the Bourne and Avengers movies he will be in. And please the comic was just not needed. The gagets well let's look at the famous ""car"" Tom said ""wait until you see the car"". Well we saw that car for all of 3 to 4 min and it looked nice but hey what was so cool about it?

I do agree with another reviewer that special features on the DVD were also very weak. For me the best MI was number 3 with this being the bottom one. Many die hard MI fans hate the first one for what they did to Mr. Phelps. I am glad the director for the next one will not be the same.

Lots of big scenes and a fun pace, with a few amazingly hot women mixed in. There were some really cool scenes, like driving a car off...something undisclosed right now in case you haven't watched....to get somewhere faster, a missile hitting the side of a building and bouncing off, a prison break, etc...There were some funny moments, as would be expected when you've got Simon Pegg in the cast, and the end features a funny cameo from Ving Rhames as well. As always, nothing goes right, and adaptation to circumstances are key, overcoming impossible odds to essentially save the world. I think if you are in the market for a fun, fast paced action flick no shortage of unrealistic stuff going down. this will fit the bill nicely.
side note...you can definitely tell that Cruise is getting older in this flick, and if you aren't enamored by Agent Carter, well, you aren't a girl or a guy realistically.

Jeremy Renner was utilized poorly. The movies stunts were sometimes laughable.

They even had  a scene when the did the famous Tom C.  fall with the arms at the side.  It just wasn't Tom's character this time.  They need to focus less on Ethan and more on the other characters.  The strength of the original series was the whole crew not just Mister Phelps.  Better scripts less toys.  Oh almost forgot.  I really hate to turn my entire brain off in a movie.  That scene where the show the giant fan for cooling the servers is so much BS.  They would never have one big fan to cool electronics.  They'd have a bunch of little ones.  To me that was like the movie I saw as a kid called Tom Horn.  It was suppose to be in either 19th century or early 20th century Africa and in one scene I saw a 1960's Chevy Impala in the back ground and Jet con trails too.  That is how lame that was for me.

4364319,5,B004EPYZUS,"I'm not a Mission Impossible girl; never watched the other 3 - heard yays and nays about them and I can't tell you why this one got my attention. I don't trust previews as a rule. Sometimes there's no more action than what you've just seen. In Ghost Protocol that's impossible! I watched the video on my laptop but I was in the movie. I kept leaning toward the screen, motioning with my hands, reacting, reacting, reacting so involved my legs didn't have time to turn to jelly as I was running down the side of the tallest building in the world in Dubai with Tom Cruise. He was exhausted, he kept going; I couldn't let exhaustion get the better of me, I had to keep watching. His team weren't supermen, excuse me, superpersons - there was one female but they did incredible things almost leaping tall buildings at a single bound. They dodged bullets, got hit, winged it on their own just like any of us would do faced with a crisis that had to work out. I sat in that chair facing the assassin, staying calm, hoping...

  It was the combination of absolutely shocking scenes, the Kremlin blown to bits erupting under Ethan Hunt's feet - I didn't expect that, the Secretary getting shot - who's left on their side now - that can't be fixed, together with ""you bet your ass captain"" Simon Pegg, not to mention the female of the team who is alluring yet as tough as her male counterparts, and the late addition analyst as the 4th member - the boy next door and full of surprises. I hear Tom Cruise is 50. That's just a number, let me tell you. I can't remember the last time I felt exhilarated after watching a film. Don't worry, I didn't go downtown and try to run down the side of a building - in the mid-west they're lower to the ground - but I knew I could if I tried.

This one didn't have quite the cast of the first, nor the surprising good-guy-turns-out-to-be-bad plot, but it did have some cool twists.  Why not give the mask to the bad guy, too?  And the opening scene with the female assassin reminded me quite a bit of The Sting.  Don't want to give away the rest, but the surprises continue, including brief nods to the first and third movies.

4364325,4,B004EPYZUS,"I was interested to see what Brad Bird (of The Incredibles) would do with his first live feature. The action sequences are handled very deftly - and there's plenty of them - but the only disappointment is that there's really zero character growth. The Ethan Hunt and team we meet at the beginning of the film is exactly the same as at the end minus the impending nuclear war.

The script brings some cartoonish originality to the action and definitely requires the viewer not merely to suspend disbelief but leaving it safely dangling somewhere out of plain sight. There are also enough gadgets to make the average Bond movie look like they ran out of ideas years ago. The plot doesn't make an enormous amount of sense but it hardly matters once you get into the pace.

Talking of pace, there's a 5-minute sandstorm sequence which should have been edited out and but it's all forgiven for the adrenalin-fueled run around the world's tallest building. The sequence was enough to give me vertigo and I was amazed that nothing here was green-screened - a tip of the hat to Tom Cruise for being crazy enough to perform his own stunts.

The comedy element of the film depends on how much you like Simon Pegg who appears in way too many scenes. Much like fellow British comic Ricky Gervais, his endless capability to play himself from film to film starts to get wearing. In my humble opinion, neither really has the ability to carry themselves in a big screen movie.

Ghost Protocol is a fun film to watch and certainly better than most action films I've seen recently. But the lack of character development and the tired comedic moments mean that I probably won't watch it again.",1334880000,,1674,4.64527027027027

The original IMAX version of the film switches between 2:40:1 for most scenes and 1:43:1 for the scenes filmed with IMAX cameras. The IMAX cameras allowed a lot of image to be captured on film and give a wonderful picture. Blu-Ray releases for ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""Tron: Legacy"" preserve the film's IMAX scenes by cropping them 1:78:1 (although the IMAX scenes for ""Tron: Legacy"" were originally filmed in 1:78:1 so there was no cropping there).

And as for the sequence of Cruise ""climbing"" the Burj Khalifa, it had all the suspense of watching Jello set.  It was patently obvious that the film-makers had build a horizontal facade, so that, rather than climbing, Cruise is actually crawling along the thing, wearing a ridiculous pair of suction gloves.

An essential aspect of an action film is a believable sense of danger.  The problem with making characters impervious to injury is the sense of danger evaporates.  It doesn't matter how scary what they're doing is if you know they will just get up and walk away at the end of the scene.  The many ridiculous aspects of the film wouldn't matter if the characters were believable, but because they are not we are left with a series of fast moving puzzles - it's all about timing and positioning like those old video games where you jump from one platform to another while the clock ticks.

It's not surprising that some people love this film and others do not.  MI-GP does whiz-bang action better than anything I've seen to date, and if that's enough for you then this is your film.

4364366,3,B004EPYZUS,"Sadly, ever since Brian De Palma directed the original `Mission: Impossible' film back in 1996, the franchise has taken a nosedive.  The first film was so inspired and so dark; using subtlety in place of over the top action sequences in order to create a truly grounded and organic film.  Sure, there were moments of extreme peril (who can forget that droplet of sweat) and there were extreme action scenes (that helicopter sequence was staggering) but they didn't feel like gimmicks.  Then we had `Mission: Impossible II', directed by John Woo.  This was a straight up action flick with some superb moments, but overall the film ranks second place to its soundtrack, and that is never a good thing.  When I initially saw the J.J. Abrams helmed third installment, I found it compelling and thought for a brief moment that it balanced the stealth of the original with the action of the second rather well.  It has since faded and became, in my esteem, the worst of the franchise, despite a rather devilish turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman.

So that brings us to Brad Bird's `Ghost Protocol'.  Yes, that Brad Bird, the guy who directs Pixar cartoons.

`Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol' once again feels strained.  The plot itself becomes null and void because it struggles to make sense, and the action scenes are so over the top they can come across bizarre, but what Bird does well here is grapple with the balance of serious and humor that makes the film all the more `fun'.  Maybe this has to do with his grasp of animated fare and the understanding of mood, but I found that this film didn't take itself as seriously as Woo's or Abrams' films and so it felt better on my stomach.  I understand that it is ridiculous, but I embraced it because it wasn't forced down my throat.  The visual effects are amazing, especially that glass building climb sequence, and the sand storm is ravishing (if unnecessary).  The acting is kind of bad, especially Paula Patton who goes all Beyonce at one point and I felt like I was watching `Obsessed', but you aren't watching this for the acting; right?  In the scope of the series, I can't rate this yet.  Initially I'd place it second, but I have a feeling in time it'll fall to third.  The first two films, while wildly different in tone, stick to their strengths.  I want someone to blend the two to perfection, but as of yet that hasn't happened.",1334793600,3,2388,4.645238095238096

Amazon edition (3 stars), I returned it for BestBuy Edition (5 stars).

--Original Review--
I had heard tons of praise for this MI film, and was excited to pre-order it, however after receiving the pre-order on release day, I read that Best Buy got the exclusive 2 Blu Ray (plus everything else) edition.

So now, I'm returning the Amazon edition, and ordering the Best Buy edition with 3 discs (second Blu Ray disc has all the extras). If you just want the movie, and a couple extra things, then the Amazon version is fine, but if you're a movie geek, then get the Best Buy version, I'm just bummed that I didn't order it at Best Buy on release day, when it was $19.99 (like it was on Amazon).
--End Original Review--

""While Ghost Protocol does not reinvent the blockbuster genre, it provides over two hours of effortless escapist filmmaking, thanks to director Brad Bird's zippy confidence guiding the many action scenes, Cruise's movie-star charisma, and a couple of engaging supporting performances from Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg.

One small caveat: those purchasing the Blu-ray through Amazon will miss out on more than sixty minutes of bonus supplements; only Best Buy carries a deluxe edition with these additions on a separate disc. It is Best Buy's version that Martin Liebman calls ""a must-own package"" in his Blu-ray review, a high-definition release that ranks as ""one of the best releases of 2012 to date...It's not at all convenient that fans cannot buy this version through Amazon, but those interested in the full slate of extras have no choice.""

The humor could have worked if the acting had been good, the action sequences well put together and the overall pacing on par with MI3. But the acting is flat, the action sequences poorly shot and edited and the pacing is completely off. It seems they put the wrong director on this one. MI4 is unfortunately, in my opinion, the worst of the series.",1334707200,3,487,4.362637362637362
4364403,3,B004EPYZUS,"For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a `serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.

It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (La Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie. Grady Harp, April 12",1334707200,4,2753,4.627811860940695

Now they're after a madman armed with Russian nuclear missile codes (which is never a good thing), a true idealist bent on making everyone even...through mass destruction.

Brad Bird brings his particular creative genius to the MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE franchise, much as his predecessor J. J. Abrams did for the third installment (Abrams is here as a producer).  The result is a fun romp filled with thrills, chills, and quite a bit of laughter.  (The centerpiece, Hunt hanging off the tallest building in the world, is capped by one of the most well-timed one-liners in recent memory.)  It's more or less what you expect from this series; if you liked the first three (we'll forgive you for not liking the second film, however), you'll like GHOST PROTOCOL.  It's no-apologies-necessary entertainment, plain and simple.  It has the great action sequences, the improbable technology and plot points (only Tom Cruise would drive a convertible at high speed during a sandstorm), that we secretly hope for every time we sit down before an action film.

What sets GHOST PROTOCOL above your typical flick of this type is the way it handles its characters and actors.  (For example: when a character's knee is dislocated in a key scene, it STAYS dislocated, and said character is forced to hop around.  You just don't see that in a Schwarzenegger film.)  Tom Cruise is in fine form; he's still doing some of his own stunts, still kicking butt and taking names, and yes, he's still charming as all get out.  Joining him are Simon Pegg (returning from the previous film, with a much larger role), Paula Patton, and Jeremy Renner; each of these supporting characters/actors manages to hold their own and leave their stamp on the film, which isn't easy when you're acting opposite Tom Cruise.  For a villain, we have Michael Nyqvist (from the original GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO films), who doesn't get much to do, save for his final, brilliant, and heart-stopping scene.  There are also a few great cameos, which I won't spoil here; I'll only mention Tom Wilkinson because he was in the trailers, and because it's not easy to upstage Cruise and Renner, yet Wilkinson does so without breaking a sweat.

MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE - GHOST PROTOCOL is a slick action movie, another solid entry in a deservedly-beloved series.  It isn't as great as the first film, and lacks the adrenaline-fueled rush of the third (not to mention Philip Seymour Hoffman), but it's still a fine flick, much better than it could have been (and what many people expected).  Maybe it's not perfect, but it doesn't try to be.  It's popcorn entertainment, brought to you courtesy of the powerhouse that is (and will always be) Tom Cruise.  If that sounds like your thing, then by all means, fasten your seat belt and take a two-hour cruise (get it?) through the world of MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE.",1334620800,2,2998,4.900990099009901

Of all the past Blu-ray + Digital Copy products I purchased, this was an easy process: you either enter the DVD that comes with the product in your DVD Drive and unlock the Digital Copy with the key provided; or you are directed to a Website or iTunes to redeem your digital copy with the code provided. In this case: your are sent on a goose chase to the paramount site to open an account, then to another site to open an account there, then you need to link both accounts, and then you're directed to the download for the movie -- and then, you realize: to download it, you need to install Silverlight (sorry, I'm a Mac user; I shouldn't have to install Silverlight for streaming anything, and I'm not going to). This is utterly misleading, since on the case it states that the Digital Copy is compatible with iTunes. Not sure how that works if I can't get past the requirement to install Silverlight first. I understand Paramount's reasoning behind all this (they want you to sign up for their Ultraviolet cloud service through which they hope you will purchase and stream movies going forward), but I have my accounts already: iTunes and (occasionally) Netflix, and I have no desire to sign up for yet another streaming service/store. Great flick; very disappointed with this product/package; see no reason to purchase these Blu-ray + Digital Copy products in the future if the future means jumping through all these hoops to end up with nothing in the end. If there is just a Blu-ray version (without Digital Copy) for cheaper, I'd rather go with that (or download the HD version from iTunes).",1334620800,2,1770,4.622222222222222

Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol was a good film however, many of the points above are missing and I do not like it as much as MI:3. The action is non-stop and the stunt at the World's Tallest Building is heart stopping. I think Brad Bird following in the footsteps of DePalma, Woo, and JJ did a great job establishing himself as an action director.

This really was Tom Cruises film. Didn't recognize the other people except Simon Pegg and Ving Rhymes only appeared in a cameo, so Kudos really are due Cruise for going all out and giving his best to give us our moneys worth. The setup of the MIF team, the escapes and detective work to find out who screwed them all over, moves along at a roller coaster pace, after a while I almost wanted to leave the theatre cause it was just so much adrenaline pumping thru this movie I was about to blow a gasket. No stupid fancy footwork, a couple of interesting gadgets but the rest of the film relied on the quick thinking of Tom Cruise to find out what happened and he does it well and believably. Well worth adding to your BD collection when it comes out.

Now I don't read the entertainment rags so maybe nobody knows, but I hope Cruise manages at least one more movie before laying the franchise to rest. Despite being a secret agent movie, Cruise really showed a lot of maturity in how he played the role of Ethan Hunt, having to fend for himself now being rogue.

4364485,5,B004EPYZUS,"Tom Cruise is a great movie star. There. I said it. After some thirty years in this business and about twenty-five of those years spent as a bona-fide star, he can still make it work. No matter what you may think of him personally, there is an effortless charm that he brings to almost all of his films. Lately, though, it's been a bit of a slog. With films like KNIGHT AND DAY, VALKYRIE and LIONS FOR LAMBS (Remember that film? Yeah, me neither), he hasn't been packing them in like he used to. Even M-I:3 was considered something of a failure, despite doing over $350 million worldwide. But that's Hollywood for ya: You jump on Oprah's couch and you claim that psychology is a scam, and people look at you differently, even when you're acting. I've loved Cruise's work for decades (except when he's in REALLY lousy films, like COCKTAIL or THE FIRM or VANILLA SKY), and I've admired him when he took risks (like MAGNOLIA and COLLATERAL, even if I don't care for those films). When I heard that he had gotten Brad Bird, the director of Pixar classics THE INCREDIBLES and RATATOUILLE and my favorite hand-drawn English animated film of all time, THE IRON GIANT, I was VERY excited. This is obviously someone who knows extremely creative storytelling, and really knows how to construct a scene. But it was also his first live-action film. But with Simon Pegg returning, and new additions like Jeremy Renner, Tom Wilkinson, and Josh Holloway (despite the latter two had nothing more than cameos, really), and with working again with J.J. Abrams who helped revitalize the series with the third film, I still had high hopes.

Then the reviews started pouring in.

WOW. People were LOVING this film. And by all accounts, they were exactly right to. The film is ear-to-ear grinning and wall-to-wall action. Not the pensive De Palma action of the first film, and not John Woo M:I-2 mega-ultra gunplay action, and not uncomfortably realistic J.J. Abrams action; but like a snowball rolling down a hill, once it starts, it just gets bigger and bigger and then you find yourself at the bottom of that hill and you await the bliss of the impact. Bird lays the hyper-dynamic (and dare I say cartoonish) set pieces piled one on top of another like the most delicious action-adventure cake you've tasted in years. The haters can keep hating on Cruise, but he really makes this film pop just as much as Bird does. His breezy wit and afore-mentioned effortless charm flow during some of the film, but he gets down to business in a big way. One complaint I keep seeing of this film is how unrealistic it is. Guess what? IT'S MISSION &#*%^@& IMPOSSIBLE!! If it were MISSION: POSSIBLE, then I could accept that criticism. This is not HILL STREET BLUES; It's MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. It's not supposed to be realistic at all times.

This is by far the best of the M:I series, and I hope that Bird and Cruise team up again soon, because that would be another mission I would absolutely choose to accept.",1332720000,7,2977,4.666666666666667

If that doesn't sound like a great formula for MI:GP, then break out the AED because you're having heart problems.

Brief plot synopsis (potential spoilers):

Ethan Hunt was in the Kremlin on a mission when something huge went awry, IMF is implicated because Hunt is seen running (!) from the scene, tensions in the already strained US/Russia relations rise, Hunt and team - Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane (Paula Patton), Benji (Simon Pegg) - go rogue to clear the organization of wrong-doing and save the world from enemy Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) nefarious plans.  So, par for the course when Hunt chooses to accept his mission.

Director Brad Bird really nails it in this one.  From beginning (awesome prison break scene) to end (amazing final battle), he brings life back into the MI franchise with a balance between frenetic and suave, putting Cruise in a position to succeed and filling the gaps with a great blend of action equal (Renner), foreboding villain (Nyqvist), gorgeous sidekick (Patton), and comic fodder (Pegg).  What's great, however, is the narrow roles defined for each are easily outdone, as each actor brings so much to their individual character.  On top of that, the FX is simply jaw-dropping on a fairly large scale.  Throw in pulse-pounding, nonstop action and this is easily my favorite MI film.

times ( four of those in awesome IMAX ) I still couldn't believe how much he put into this movie. Talk about commitment , but that
has pretty much defined Cruise in his career. Great job by Brad Bird , hard to believe this is his first live action film .
And what action ! Kinda feel sorry for the guy in a way , don't know how he's gonna top this ! Great support cast , Paula Patton
was awesome, someone give this beauty a movie ( franchise ? ) worthy of her talent. Simon Pegg was great comic relief also.

The only problem I had was with Jeremy Renner's character - after giving such strong performances in Hurt Locker and The Town I found
he was underused ( if that's a word ) in this movie- absolutely no slight on Renner just think his part could have been bigger.

Overall definitely best action movie of 2010 . Best since 1988 ( see Die Hard ) and well worth owning. For the ( too short )

4364514,2,B004EPYZUS,"A minority report (no pun intended)-
I understand I will be the only one that feels this way, but honestly, this latest Mission Impossible left me hoping that they don't make a 5th. The Plot had potential but came up short for me. Shot in locations that don't very often have the good fortune be filmed in and for good reason - no one cares about making a pit stop in Mumbai to climb a building or Dubai to visit a Millionaire playboy with 6 cell phones and a hair style that would make Elvis jealous.
The rag-tag team that they put together for this film was the worst of the 4 movies by far. It could not have gotten any more clich if they tried. The Veteran, who swaddles his far less than experienced co-agents' mistakes, the Rookie agent, who bungles nearly every miniscule task and makes up for it with humor, the hot chick with an axe to grind and the slightly out of practice desk agent with a secret to hide. Add a dash of revenge, some slapstick and gadgets, although cool, that defy all reason. Put that together and you've got more like a Saturday morning cartoon than an IMF team. Let's face it; the Rescue Rangers could have pulled this off in a window of 22 min.
The Bad Guys - what can I say? They were practically nonexistent. Aside for a romp through a dust storm and a slip n' fall sequence in an automated parking garage there was NOTHING that made these Baddies special. One hardly spoke a word throughout the whole film; and it wasn't like he was a brooding mute that would rather do his taking with his dukes, which would have been cool, he just didn't say anything. Half way through the film I had to recall that he was one of the players in this movie.
The dedicated and completely inept Russian agents were totally unnecessary. They ran around the world chasing the American only get beat up on an escalator, hardly a triumph for Russian combat training. Then to pop up 5 seconds after ""mission accomplished"" to realize that all is well and that it was all part of the plan. The assassin tried to be cool with her ""payment only in diamonds"" nonsense, but her build up and character expansion was a lot like watching someone get pushed out of a 130 story window; quick, splat, move on. The ""major villain"", such that he was, had no character build up except for a DVD monolog about his penchant for nuclear holocaust. Other than that, he provided the highly trained IMF agent with a surprisingly combative prowess, especially for a slightly overweight politician that did little more than silently swing around a metal case.
I give this movie 2 stars only for the well put together jail break scene in the beginning. It actually felt like a Mission Impossible movie but quickly and silently slipped into a film of mediocrity.",1330214400,9,2750,4.4800796812749

4364558,5,B004EPYZUS,"I can't say where this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible franchise ranks among the other three, having been too long since I've seen them, but I can say that it's one of the best action movies of the year boasting a stunning collection of extravagant action sequences including at least one that will become iconic. It shows that, just a year shy of 50, Tom Cruise is still more than capable of being the ultimate action star, braver and more dedicated than many half his age. Brad Bird, known for acclaimed and beloved films like The Iron Giant and The Incredibles, makes his live-action debut, bringing an animator's sensibility that I think is at least partly responsible for why these action sequences are so memorable and extravagant. Anything is possible in animation and Bird doesn't allow shooting a live-action film to interfere with this credo. He may have a background in animation, but he obviously knows what makes an action movie work as Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol doesn't rely solely on CGI and the latest technology to make its most impressive sequences come alive. There is CGI of course, but the most impressive action sequence here uses it only to erase the cables and wires used to protect its fearless star. Furthermore, Bird opted to shoot 30+ minutes of footage in IMAX rather than 3D, thank goodness, and he has fashioned a film that continues to impress me the more I think about it.

The film opens with two heart-racing action sequences, the second of which involves IMF agent Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) orchestrating a Moscow prison break for Ethan Hunt (Cruise). Once he has escaped, Hunt is immediately put on assignment to infiltrate the Moscow Kremlin archives to assist in identifying a person of interest, code-named ""Cobalt."" Things go wrong on the mission and Russia declares the occurrence as an undeclared act of war, prompting the president to activate Ghost Protocol and effectively disavow the entire IMF. Joined by William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), the IMF secretary's chief analyst, Ethan and his team must stop Cobalt (Michael Nyqvist) from initiating nuclear war with none of the government backing or tools usually afforded to them. Branded as terrorists and with government agencies all over the world after them, they truly find themselves with an impossible mission.

These movies are defined by the greatness of their action sequences, which will lead many to brand Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol a great film as each sequence is followed by another with a higher or equal breadth of vision. These sequences are clever, inventive, and frightfully exciting, assembled by people with a true grasp of how to put together action. The scene destined for future icon-status, already the most talked about part of the film, features Hunt, equipped with gloves that adhere to glass, climbing up the glass windows of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. It's common to see a character in an action film scaling a tall building; less common is when the building is the tallest building in the world, the character is more than 100 stories up, the scene is shot on location without green screen, and that's actually Tom Cruise up there instead of a stunt double. How's your masculinity feel now? This is the best action sequence of any film this year and I have complete faith in making that statement without further vertigo that my palms were actually sweating and I breathed a sigh of relief when it was all over. I saw the film on a standard theater screen and was astonished by this sequence, but I would pay full admission price just to see this one sequence alone in IMAX.

The Burj Khalifa is the main set piece among additional action sequences that seem equally determined to make an impact. More elaborate and well-executed than what you'll find in most action movies, they don't take themselves too seriously and usually balance suspense and humor in equal measure. The scene in the Kremlin is certainly goofy, but undeniably clever. Renner's big sequence, an idea that had to sound too over-the-top on paper, involves a large spinning fan, a magnet, and a steel mesh suit. It works due to Renner's convincing fear and the even-handed filmmaking. After all these fabulous moments, the final action sequence in a space age, multi-level parking garage that was constructed over six-months solely for this scene may be underwhelming in comparison, but would warrant high praise in any other film.

It's written by Josh Appelbaum and Andr Nemec, two first-time screenwriters with backgrounds in television. Writing is often overlooked on a blockbuster action picture, but here it's equally responsible for this latest entry in the Mission: Impossible series working so well beyond the awe-inspiring action moments. It functions almost as a direct sequel to the last film and intersperses moments of strong dramatic conflict, allowing the heroes to be human rather than emotionless machines. The dramatic conflict and the comical character Benji may seem a bit formulaic, but it works by using a formula rather than following a formula. The smart script breaks some conventions with Jane, the ""love interest,"" being an agent who is just as smart and capable as those around her and able to hold her own in a dangerous situation. She is there to look sexy too, but her purpose isn't just to share romantic moments with Tom Cruise. In fact, there is no romance between them which makes her seem like an important supporting character rather than the static ""sexy female agent"" character. I don't know how much of Benji results from being played by Simon Pegg, but he works as the comedic foil because he's not over-the-top or preoccupied with inserting witty dialogue into every sentence.

The greatest weakness is the main villain, who certainly isn't as interesting as the hero. The idea of starting a nuclear war to initiate the next stage of human evolution is a bit of a stretch for any psychotic villain but, more importantly, he seems less interested in accomplishing these bad deeds than the heroes do stopping him. Nyqvist does a fine job in the role and he has the perfect look and demeanor to eventually play a Bond villain, but his character here lacks a real feeling of purpose and depth.

All of the acting is fine, more than adequate for an action film. Patton is convincingly tough, Nyqvist convincingly evil. Pegg isn't too brash or obnoxious as the comedic relief and Cruise is his typical, sensitive but fearless self. It's been said that Renner has been introduced so Cruise can pass the torch when he finally steps away from the franchise and I'll admit that he settles into the role well as he possesses the emotional depth of a real actor and the physical prowess of an action star. I'm not ready to see Cruise step away from this franchise, but Renner could be quite effective in his shoes. He does a particularly good job looking frightened before jumping down a ventilator shaft; I wonder how he would've reacted having to climb the Burj Khalifa.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a film that you can see without risk. If you disagree with any of the positive elements I've mentioned, you're left with exhilarating action sequences that can't be dismissed. It's a blockbuster action film that intends only to entertain and it succeeds so wonderfully at doing so. People have qualms with Mr. Cruise because of some zany television antics a few years ago and his controversial religious preference, but this is all irrelevant when you get down to the movie and his performance. Few actors bring the amount of dedication and desire to entertain that Tom Cruise does with every film he's in. At 49-years-old, Cruise is still a bonafide action star that can convincingly play a character like Ethan Hunt without resorting to self-deprecating jokes about a receding hairline or high cholesterol. This man works hard in his movies, doing things that some much younger actors would pass on. On a recent television appearance, Cruise was asked why he didn't use a stunt double for the Burj Khalifa scene. ""He was afraid of heights,"" Cruise replied.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol shows that this franchise and Cruise's star power are far from burning out. With the brilliant creative decision to bring Brad Bird on board, this is a great action picture, more entertaining and creative than most of the blockbuster garbage that's spewed into theaters and gobbled up like fast food by philistines. In an era when filmmakers seem to think that CGI is all that's necessary to make a blockbuster, it's great to see a solid action film using traditional daredevil tactics while utilizing the latest technology to improve on tradition rather than replace it.

4364559,5,B004EPYZUS,"Action films could also be boring as directors often rely only on CGI and stunts to entertain. MI4 is different, not only does it great action and stunts but a story line as well.

Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) gets away from the Moscow prison by the IMF, Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) for another mission' -  to break in to the Kremlin and steal files related to a person called `Cobalt' (Michael Nyqvist). But things go wrong,as Kremlin gets bombed and IMF is accused of doing it. The US govt initiates a `ghost protocol' (no protection) against them and thus they become rogue agents.

4364562,4,B004EPYZUS,"Mission Impossible may just be one of the most satisfying television show to movie adaptations of all time. There have been four movies in the series and the third installment took the series to a whole new level. The newest installment, ""Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol"" has created a new level on top of that. With complex storylines that intertwine, realistic and jaw dropping action scenes, nicely placed humor and the ability to let the audience play along, MIP 4 may just be the perfect spy movie.

When the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is shutdown after being blamed for a bombing at the Kremlin, four agents are forced to work without help in order to clear their name and stop a world-changing catastrophe. Sounds like a tense storyline doesn't it? Well, it is. Every second counts and the movie makes you feel those seconds counting by at every moment and during every task at hand. Everything is nip and tuck and the movie feels that way due to the tight writing and seamless editing.

Some of the most awe-inspiring stunts I've ever witnessed are in MIP4. They are so well done and so beautifully shot that there is no suspension of belief to be had. In fact, I'm pretty sure that was Tom Cruise swinging back and forth outside the Burj Khalifa tower, which is the tallest building in the world. The reason why is because it was Tom Cruise doing his own stunts. The actions scenes are real and filmed in a way that isn't hokey and impossible to follow. The car chases are intense. The fights are physical and real looking and don't have shaking cameras to disguise the lack of realism. The action scenes aren't over the top like most block buster movies these days try to pass off in order to please the ticket buyers.

""MIP4: Ghost Protocol"" is an exciting and creative movie for anyone who loves espionage type films. The disguises, the technology, the backstabbing, the people in powerful places and the high intensity are all in place.

4364564,5,B004EPYZUS,"I'm old enough to have been a fan of the old Mission: Impossible TV show, when things ALWAYS went according to plan.  Not only did the tactical scheme always go off without a hitch, but the efficiency of the team members never varied, devices worked perfectly, and, heck, Barney the technical whiz never even had a screwdriver slip off the notch.

PERFECT - every time.

But that stopped in the movies.

It angered me in M:I, Movie Number One, when they not only actually had the gall to take a major character from the original series--in fact, the very backbone of it--and ""flip"" him, but they went one step worse: they made the storyline so incomprehensibly jumbled and unclear that what was IMPOSSIBLE about it was trying to comprehending it.

Two was better, but it wasn't until M:I Three that they really got the formula right.  And, coincidentally, it was exactly that movie that brought about the arrival of J.J. Abrams, the creator of ""Lost"" and a host of other great projects.  His touch enlivened the M:I series in a manner similar to his reawakening of the Star Trek franchise: his emphasis has always been the development of intriguing characters alongside a compelling story line, and that ""mission"" has been accomplished here.

""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is a terrific afternoon film: it does a wonderful job at removing you from the everyday tedium of your own life, convincing you that someone else's problems are worse than yours, and fills the two hours with wall-to-wall action.

Now, whether ""M:I-GP"" is believable--that's another discussion point.  But it's like asking an avid football fan whether the Super Bowl is really all it's cracked up to be: it just doesn't matter.

What is important is what's before you on the screen, and it's here ""M:I-GP"" excels.  From the opening rooftop shoot-out to the wham-bam finale, this movie really delivers.  There is scarcely enough time between chases and explosions and ingenious devices and lavish set pieces to let you chomp your popcorn or candy.

I'm not the biggest Cruise fan out there, and frankly quite often have to overlook his presence in a project before I'm interested in it, but even I have to admit he really delivers here.  He has a commanding screen presence, and combines a cunning, thinks-fast-on-his-feet persona with a healthy dose of big ol' Mark Wahlberg-ish arms and a whole bunch of can-do American earnestness.  He's a force to be reckoned with here, and it's hard not to get behind him.

Speaking of behind him, as his backup we have Simon Pegg as the suitably nerdy and usually reliable computer nerd, Paula Patton as the sexy and quite capable fellow agent, and Jeremy Renner as the shaky final member in the quartet who is hiding a compelling secret of his own.

The four make up a suitably efficient team that can be both resourceful yet capable of making, if not mistakes, then, well, miscalculations.  So, while it may be true that the M:I of yesteryear is no longer here, what stands in its place is a much more visceral, in-your-face representation of it.  A clever indication of that occurred very early in the movie when, following the obligatory ""this message will self-destruct in five seconds"" pause, Ethan Hunt waits, and waits, and waits some more, then walks back to the device (a Russian pay phone) and thumps it, wherein it finally sizzles and smokes.

It's an indication of what's to come, for almost everything that CAN go wrong DOES in this flick, and the film is barely moments old when not only an important agent is offed (Josh Holloway, an Abrams' castaway from the old Lost"" series), the Kremlin is demolished, and the U.S. has been blamed for it.  Likewise, once assigned to the case the steel-jawed Cruise and his able crew fight off power outages, betrayals, a sandstorm, the constant breaking down of equipment, and a never-say-die Russian agent who dogs Ethan Hunt every step of the way.

What's important is that ""M:I-GP"" never disappoints, and in fact rewards us like the best of the Bond series with expensive equipment, international scenery, dazzling set pieces, and a series of ""Can you top this?"" stunts that even have Hunt hanging off the ridiculously tall Burj Khalifa building in Dubai--where yes, as usual, Cruise did most of his own stunts.

Much of the credit must also go to the excellent work of Brad Bird, who directed not only ""Iron Giant"" but also the terrific ""The Incredibles"" animated movies, the latter of which is the CGI equivalent of any Bond/M:I film out there.  It was Bird's decision to shoot some of the footage in ""M:I-GP"" with IMAX cameras, and it pays off on the screen--this movie is a real beauty to watch.

See ""M:I-GP"" if you are looking for some high-octane entertainment: it delivers in every sense of the word.",1328227200,,4785,4.819070904645477
4364565,4,B004EPYZUS,"What initially got me excited about this movie wasn't the fact that it's a Mission: Impossible film, though that's certainly a good starting point. Curiosity did. I like that each Mission film hand selects qualifying directors to helm continuing serials in the title series. Brad Bird is a welcome addition. Previously directing animated masterpieces The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles, Bird has shown an exemplary eye for dissecting authentic human character, and by doing so, creating heartfelt drama, comedy, and perhaps most importantly, heightened peril.

Character's an imperative element to film yet often diagnosed as the necessary evil for establishing most action moneymakers, but Bird prevails. Mission not only parades these elements, it does so in a poetic framework that exemplifies and makes you thirst for each character on screen. What I like most about the script is its comedic elements in very strenuous situations. Tom Cruise barely hanging on for life from a Dubai skyscraper and angrily disposing of his broken glove only to find it sponged on a window several stories higher, as though taunting him, brings satisfactory relief to suicidal vertigo.

He exquisitely portrayed strong leadership while he was also ambitious. He set his goal to accomplish the ""mission"" and not to what seemed to be ""right"". One great component of the movie is that the actors had humorous dialogue in serious situations.

  MI4 was appropriately rated at PG-13. I recommend anyone 10+ up to go and watch the film. Though if you decide to take your young ones, they will surely appreciate the awesome gadgets used. For example, wall climbers were used to climb up the largest building in the world. The spies even took a picture of a wall and then  put the image on a screen that deceives the eye, and makes you believe the wall is where it always was, even though there are people right in front of you.

  You might be wondering by now  what the movie is really about. A Russian ruler steals nuclear power codes, it is Tom Cruise and his crew's job to stop him before he blows up the world. The movie displays outstanding visuals of famous buildings and places across the globe. Really, the only con on the movie I am able to think of is that I finished my popcorn before the previews were over.

I enjoyed the movie a lot more this time though.  It was a lot of fun.  Don't hesitate watching it.  It's worth the time and money.",1326153600,3,547,3.918181818181818
4364602,5,B004EPYZUS,"When I've told people that I wanted to see this, every single person gave me this weird look, making me say that I am in no way a fan of Tom Cruise, I like these movies because I like the TV series (except for M:I 2). Though the series is better (at least the first five seasons), this one was the best out of the four and I actually liked Tom Cruise in this one. While being the main star of the film, this one brings the team aspect to the forefront, which was never really shown in the previous ones (except M:I 3). Each member of the team is given something to do. The rest of the cast was great as well as the story. Out of the four, the plot of this film reminded me of the series the most; the way the team takes over the hotel by taking over the computer network, changing the floor numbers, etc. The action scenes were great, especially Tom Cruise scaling the building (is it always necessary for him to be climbing or dangling from something in these movies). And, as my title states, this felt more like a James Bond movie than Quantum of Solace (and to a lesser extent, Casino Royale). While the original Mission: Impossible series never featured as many gadgets as the movies have, I feel the films, more or less, still felt like the series (though making Jim Phelps a traitor in the first film is something I still didn't like). Though despite my dislike for Tom Cruise, I actually hope he's involved with a fifth Mission: Impossible. I also find it quite interesting how this fourth film in a franchise  has recieved very positive reviews when other fourth films usually show that the franchise is tired and boring (Jaws: The Revenge, Superman 4, Batman & Robin and Breaking Dawn).",1326067200,,1696,4.401273885350318
4364603,5,B004EPYZUS,"""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Blamed for the terrorist bombing of the Kremlin, IMF operative Ethan Hunt is disavowed along with the rest of the agency when the President initiates ""Ghost Protocol"". Left without any resources or backup, Ethan must find a way to clear his agency's name and prevent another attack. To complicate matters further, Ethan is forced to embark on this mission with a team of fellow IMF fugitives whose personal motives he does not fully know.

The cast led by Tom Cruise (as Ethan Hunt, who also produced) is excellent. The directing by Brad Bird is excellent. The story & screenplay by Josh Appelbaum & Andre Nemec is excellent.

The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is excellent. The film editing by Paul Hirsch is excellent. The casting by April Webster & Alyssa Weisberg is excellent. The production design by James Bissell is excellent. The art direction by Michael Diner, Helen Jarvis, Christa Munro, Michael Turner, Martin Vackar & Grant Van Der Slagt is excellent. The set decoration by Rosemary Brandenburg, Andronico Del Rosario & Elizabeth Wilcox is excellent. The costume design by Michael Kaplan is excellent. The visual effects & animation by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) is excellent. The make-up effects creation by David LeRoy Anderson is excellent.

This is an excellent action movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. This is the best movie in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise, thus far. This is one of Tom Cruise's best movies in years. This is also one of the best action films, if not, the best action film of last year.",1325980800,11,1720,4.944636678200692

I had heard prior to seeing the movie, that they were wanting to go back to a team-centric story that the original tv series had followed. This film certainly delivered in that area. The team was well-rounded and the writers/directors allowed you to get to know the team a bit better than in the previous films. They also were preparing Jeremy Renner (Brandt) to eventually take over the Mission Impossible for whenever Tom Cruise decides to leave the franchise. While I am partial to Tom Cruise, I have to admit that Jeremy Renner did a good job. He certainly looked as capable as Cruise in the fighting scenes, and I have a feeling that Ethan Hunt will impart some of his confidence and craziness to Brandt before retiring.
All that to say, if you haven't seen this movie yet then go see it. You don't want to miss out on this newest adventure with legendary spy, Ethan Hunt.",1325721600,4,1123,4.592039800995025

In this all in all not unusually dumb action story (Evan Hunt, aka Cruise, saves the world again), Cruise gets to climb up the outside of Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Imagine 130th floor and the wind that comes with the elevation. Magnifico.
Also good: the sand storm comes to Dubai and we have a nice car race in it.
Forget about all the rest.
(Talking about little Cruise: I just reviewed a volume from the popular Jack Reacher series and found it very trashy. Then I learned in google that Cruise is supposed to play Reacher in a film.

4364617,5,B004EPYZUS,"Dormant since the third entry in the series arrived in 2006 - that one helmed by J.J. Abrams garnered good audience and critical response - Mission: Impossible returns and with rookie live-action director Brad Bird of Pixar fame. What materializes is arguably the best of the franchise delivering some tremendous action sequences coupled with a credible story that elevates it beyond just being a series of incredibly impressive set pieces.

When IMF is framed for the bombing of the Kremlin - four agents including Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must go underground to stop a plot to beget nuclear war while also clearing their names. Hunt is joined by the returning Benji (Simon Pegg) and newcomers Jane (Paula Patton) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner).

Bird shows incredible skill at framing fight scenes and providing some beautiful shots of locales. Being set in Russia, Dubai, and India allowed for plenty of opportunity to capture some great looking footage. The scenes with Hunt on the outside of the Burj Khalifa building were so anxiety-ridden that I almost got uncomfortable watching. That might be partially due to knowing that Cruise was actually hanging out there doing his own stunts and that it wasn't CGI - regardless it goes to show just how much impact the film had in delivering an intense experience through its action and sense of suspense which carried through to the other scenes as well.

Ghost Protocol leans heavily on Cruise who delivers an outstanding performance - an example of his undeniably strong screen presence that shines through more here than maybe ever before. The others do well also in their roles - Patton in particular was subdued in a way that typically isn't reserved for the ""sexy"" lead female.

If there is any area that falls somewhat flat it is some of the attempts at humor - which are handled in a subtle enough manner that any misses didn't hurt the film. What the lighter dialogue did do was provide some levity and a chance to breathe in what was practically non-stop adrenaline pumping action from start to finish. There is also a human touch to the story and the relationships between the characters. I particularly liked the ending - which wrapped things up in a very satisfying fashion that went beyond what one would expect out of a typical action movie.

Several scenes were shot with IMAX cameras - for those who have a (real) IMAX theater nearby it's definitely worth paying extra for. The visceral nature of those scenes are amplified greatly.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is one of the best action films in recent years. The combination of spectacular action, great performances, expert direction, and a competent story driving the events has become a rarity and Ghost Protocol delivers in every way.",1325548800,15,2761,4.926881720430107
4364618,4,B004EPYZUS,"I have been a fan of the Mission Impossible movies since the first one and I have enjoyed them all. I must say that I liked the third Mission Impossible much better. Ghost Protocol was simply an action film with some cool stunts and scenes and zero story. There was not a point in the movie which I didn't see coming around the next corner. Most of the best scenes were in the trailer and I kept waiting for a twist that never came.

I did not see this movie in IMAX, although I'm sure it would have made the movie visually more entertaining, though it still would be lacking in story. It was your basic fun action flick. Tom Cruse did well as usual as well as the rest of the cast. Everyone did a great job and made the movie a lot of fun to watch. But again, story was lacking in my opinion. There was a thing with his wife, which never really materialized into a good twist or story. It was just confusing and we really didn't figure out what really happened until the very very end. Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker) did a great job as well as Paula Patton (Dj vu) and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead). Michael Nyqvist (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Swedish version) was a nice surprise role, as I didn't know he was in this.

I must say that the locations and scenes were well thought out and take us out of the usual locations in many movies. That was one of the most interesting aspects of the film; the locations. Another fun aspect of the film was the team's gadgets and gizmos. There are many times in the film where their gadgets don't work as well as planned and greatly add tension and a bit of thrill to the situation.

Over-all it is a very good action flick with a little less of a story than one would have hoped. Yes I love action, however action mixed in with twists and character development is always more fun. In the theater there were times when everyone laughed and other times where everyone cringed as they watched Tom Cruse climb the exterior of at glass building or drive around in a sand storm. It is a fun movie and I do recommend a watch, however don't expect to be blown away by the average nearsighted story or the silly sweet ending. Watch it for the action and suspense and leave your thinking caps at home.",1325548800,,2237,4.258823529411765

(Hey, fundamentalists: You can use this movie to underline the basic unholiness of evolutionists!)

Combined with the solid MI3, this series is now firmly established as a dependable action franchise.  Director Brad Bird and screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec have strung together a series of eye-popping set pieces while still telling an engaging story full of set-backs, reverses, and surprises.  An added dimension of suspense comes from the failure of their magical technology at crucial times, requiring the team to improvise at a moment's notice.

4364620,5,B004EPYZUS,"MOVIE NOTE #19 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL

Well it seems Brad Bird (`The Incredibles', `Ratatouie', `Toy Story 3', ) can not only direct action animated films, but also has a talent for live action. His live action directorial feature debut Is amazing. This movie has everything a good film should have. A great story you can't predict, characters you care about, action that doesn't leave you saying.....'these people are not human'....and the panorama of what a big screen film should have. Definitely a must see for good entertainment.

Headed by the Tom Cruise Productions and J.J., Abrams' Bad Robot Productions this film is exciting, funny and has a really complicated story that you follow until every twist is untwined. For as much flack as he receives, Tom Cruise does a damn good job in this film. Supported by some great team members including Simon Pegg (`Star Trek' 2009, `Paul', `Hot Fuzz') who provides incredible comic relieve with his techno-genius devices and an unsuspecting female who makes her first official IMF covert mission played by Paula Patton(`Deja Vu, `Precious').

Quite by chance the team turns from the usual three person to a four-person team with a not so honest performance by Jeremy Renner (`Hurt Locker', `The Town') as a desk-driven agent who has a deeper secret and more skills than Ethan Hunt (Cruise) was aware of.

It also has some great performance by an international cast of people we don't know- but the rest of the world does - including Swedish film star Michael Nyqvist, Russin born film star Vladimir Mashkov, Finnish film star Samuli Edelmann and Russian film star Ivan Shvedoff. I applaud Tom Cruise and J.J. Abrams for bringing some really great talent to the film - giving the Mission Impossible franchise a REAL international flavor. There's even a cameo (returning as his previous character from the last two films) of Academy Award winner Tom Wilkinson.

Great action sequences, lots of great cinematography and some breathtaking stunts that would be impossible without special effects and great stuntmen. They shoot an entire amazing sequence one of the largest free-standing buildings on the Asian continent. Burj Dubai, which was started in 2004, overtook Taiwan's Taipei 101 tower as the world's tallest building when it reached 512 metres (1,533 feet) in April 2007. It is amazing.

This is a great film with a great story and definitely something to see over the Holidays. I think the best of the FOUR MI films and I certainly hope Tom and J.J. make more MI Films!",1325462400,,2536,5.01187648456057
4364621,4,B004EPYZUS,"""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" is the fourth iteration of the Impossible Mission Force movie franchise, and it might be the best.  Of course, it features the IMF racing to save the world, using the latest in hi-tech spy gadgets and featuring some mind-blowing action sequences and special effects.  But this one works because the casting is about right.

Tom Cruise returns as IMF veteran agent Ethan Hunt, who at the start of the movie must be liberated from a Russian prison by lovely field agent Paula Patton and tech whiz Simon Pegg.  Hunt is needed for a mission inside the Kremlin, which goes badly wrong.  Things get worse when the Secretary really does have to disavow all knowledge, and Hunt goes on the run with the Secretary's twitchy personal intelligence analyst, superby played by Jeremy Renner.  Screen time gets spread around nicely, as each agent gets a chance to contribute to the action.  The team banter provides some humorous breaks, especially the dialogues between Renner and Pegg.  Intriguing side plots add to the suspense.

Operating under instructions known as the Ghost Protocol, Hunt and his ad hoc team have to short-circuit an attempt by a Swedish scientist to start a nuclear war. If the premise is just a little preposterous, the movie more than makes up for it with a breathless series of nail-biting action sequences.  Like any good IMF plot, it's never quite clear how things will work out, and the suspense should keep viewers glued to their seats to the end.  ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" is highly recommended as a good old-fashioned thriller.",1325462400,,1596,4.9849056603773585
4364622,4,B004EPYZUS,"I am strangely discouraged from writing about the movies that I enjoy the most.  Take, for example, Mission Impossible:  Ghost Protocol.  Having witnessed the film in all of its innocent glory over two weeks ago, I almost gave up on the idea of writing a review for it.  Why?  I have no certain idea.  I suppose that, when it comes to the best, I'm hesitant to express an opinion that is anything but glowing.

Well, to stall any doubts, this is a glowing review of a terrific film.  And to think some people had doubts in the mastermind that is director Brad Bird.  Overseer of the Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille, director Bird is almost without equal when it comes to grace and pacing.  He is almost perfect.

Still, this was Bird's first attempt at a live-action film, and there were dangers.  Whelp, Bird took care of those quite easily.  Ghost Protocol shares the same whimsical air that all of Bird's magnificent films exude from start to finish; nothing about this film takes itself too seriously.  Predictably, that works for a film that deals with the ""impossible"".  Who would have thought?

Each set piece is mashed with a carefree humor that only Bird can properly execute, with dedicated actors Cruise and Renner following along with impeccable style and strenuous physical stunts.  Everyone's clearly on board, and it creates an atmosphere that is completely authentic and exciting.

Regarding Cruise:  Say what you will, but he was made for this role.  Handsome, energetic, and finding a perfect parity between humility and outrageous style, Mr. Ethan Hunt is the epitome of hip.  It's even more entertaining to see he and Brandt, Jeremy Renner's character, find equal footing as they pettily argue over matters.  Add the graceful Paula Patton and the always-exceptional Simon Pegg, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a more fitting cast for the best summer blockbuster of the year.

Overall, Ghost Protocol takes everything terrific about director J.J. Abrams' third iteration and initiates overdrive.  Nothing is ever stable and, occasionally, things get tangled into implausibility but, being a director of animation, Bird is so often confronted by the impossible that he had mastered the ability to overcome it.  As of now, there isn't a better family popcorn flick in theaters.",1325376000,,2309,5.0131578947368425
4364623,4,B004EPYZUS,"""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" is probably the best of the four ""MI"" installments so far starring Tom Cruise. Again he plays Ethan Hunt, an IMF agent, who finds himself in big trouble (as always). Don't expect here any logic or coherence. ""MIGP' is a roller coaster ride with lots of gadgets and cars, plus occasional humors. Perhaps too many of them, I think, but still I found myself enjoying the ride.

Without spoiling too much about the film, ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" follows the story of Ethan Hunt and three agents: William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Jane Carter (Paula Patton) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, reprising his role in""M:i:III""). They have to thwart the heinous plans of one Kurt Hendricks, but this time around without any help from the IMF.

After a rather shaky opening the film becomes interesting with set-pieces in Moscow and Dubai. The storyline itself is sometimes contrived, even impossible (by the standards of action movies), but director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"") is a skillful storyteller, who sometimes manages to effectively subvert our expectation when delivering the action scenes.

But what is really amazing is the fact Brad Bird delivers the goods despite the deeply flawed script that often seems clich and stale. Such ideas as the ""brilliant scientist-turned-dangerous terrorist"" (played by Michael Nyqvist, who was much better as the journalist in the original ""Millennium"" trilogy) and a deadly female assassin (beautiful but slightly wooden La Seydoux) would have been something unbearable in the hands of lesser talent.

Yes, Brad Bird knows they are only ""Macguffin"" (or ""Rabbit's Foot"" if you like) - a plot device for a story. Luckily he knows how to use it, keeping the pace fast, not taking the film too seriously. Enjoy it.",1325376000,,1808,5.181506849315069
4364624,2,B004EPYZUS,"MI4 is one of the most badly-executed and implausibly-plotted films I have seen in a  long time. The list of gaffes is enormous and ongoing. Two IMF members infiltrate the Kremlin; when a bomb explodes, one barely escapes, but the other one gets out, without explanation, unscathed. When Tom Cruise disguises himself as a Soviet general, his IMF pal says that he looks ""exactly"" like person he is imitating, when he looks only vaguely like his photo. A character falls out of huge skyscraper in Dubai, yet no police arrive to investigate. A character climbs up the outside of the skyscraper in broad daylight, yet no one in the building sees him, and the film does not bother to establish that the place is empty. The IMF team learns its mission to infiltrate the Kremlin barely four hours beforehand, yet happens to assemble a highly technical array of gear designed for that very purpose.

Tom Cruise tries hard to give the film some sense of peril by having some of his gadgets malfunction. Yet, again, while a simple reason could be constructed (e.g., equipment damaged in an accident or sandstorm) none is given. We are led to believe the ludicrous possibility that the infallible IMF gives its agents untested and second-rate equipment. Speaking of gadgets, the number of one-of-a-kind, highly sophisticated gadgets that the agents leave behind is astounding. Problem one, they leave behind them a nice trail of computerized gizmos. Problem two, the electronics presumably are classified, and would help the bad guys if discovered. And tell me: why does the head bad guy want to start a nuclear war between the US and USSR? 10 points if you can remember without having to check Wikipedia or IMDB.

When the film runs out of gadgets, it relies on glurges to lend itself depth. One agent mopes around, thinking he is responsible for the death of Cruise's wife. Another agent is tormented by the death of a member of her team. C'mon, folks. You are pros in a dangerous game! The after-mission debrief is not only interminable, but dopily misty, formulaic and melodramatic.

I could go on. These are not nitpicky issues. Any halfway sophisticated movie watcher is going to wonder how characters know, say, the layout of Kremlin underground passages without seeing them  bone up on it. MI5 does not just stretch credulity, it snaps it and snips it into tiny bits. The couple of decent plot points - the razzle-dazzle with the bad guys in the Dubai tower, for instance -- are quickly obliterated by an avalanche of improbability and unexplained plot twists. Tell me how an inexperienced man can make a picture perfect jump into a whirling, 10-foot fan.

But there I go again. Skip this lazy and ridiculous film. Even on video. Do not watch!",1325376000,7,2740,4.8315565031982945
4364625,3,B004EPYZUS,"Ghost Protocol is full of unending action, fast cars, and incredible adventure. Scaling a skyscraper? Check. Incredible chase scene in an epic dust storm? Check. Lavish cars? Of course.

Like all good Mission Impossible movies, Ghost Protocol pulls out all the stops when it comes to heart pounding action and fancy gadgets. The trailer sets exactly the right tone for the movie -- it's a fast-moving, action-packed roller coaster ride.

The plot is an improvement over the last two, and the quality level returns the series to its roots. Ethan Hunt is back again (although a bit older), and he's his normal self -- jail breaks, fast cars, and heart-stopping tactics.

Action, cars, cinematics, and excitement are at their peak. At the end of the movie, however, you're left with the sense that this was just a good action film. This isn't the Bourne saga; it doesn't have that depth of plot. This isn't the Hurt Locker; it doesn't have that tug of emotion.

This is a non-stop roller coaster of a movie that starts with a bang, and doesn't let up at all for the next two hours.  The story isn't the best, but the action and humor are top-notch.  The biggest quibble with the entire movie is the unneccessary sand-storm car chase sequence that adds 10 minutes to the movie that add nothing to the plot or overall action.

Lots of fun, and worth seeing on the big screen if you can.",1325203200,,573,4.419047619047619

This one showcases an older yet still agile Tom Cruise returning to the role of intrepid IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and even as he closes in on fifty, he demonstrates the same unparalleled commitment to dangerous, high-flying derring-do he displayed in the first one fifteen years ago. This time, the reins have been handed over to Brad Bird who makes his live-action directorial debut after scoring with a couple of Pixar's megahits,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredibles/dp/B00005JN4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredibles</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ratatouille/dp/B000VBJEEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ratatouille</a>. The results are fortuitous because Bird brings great visual flair to a film that demands gasp-worthy action sequences.

In fact, the action is so propulsive that the convoluted plot takes a decided backseat. Written by Andr Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.

The now-rogue agents make their way to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, where Hunt has to scale the outside of the building to manipulate the building's computer system. A botched transaction with the assassin leads to mayhem and then a final stop in Mumbai where there is the inevitable race against the clock to save the world. The movie is really all about the set pieces - the Russian prison escape, the Kremlin break-in and explosion (an excellent special effect), Hunt's gravity-defying climb in Dubai and an overwhelming sandstorm, and the movable multi-level parking lot in Mumbai which sets that stage for the final showdown. Performance are secondary in this kind of movie, but they are mostly workmanlike. Cruise is inarguably in his element as an action hero, and he appears to perform most of his death-defying stunts.

4364648,5,B004EPYZUS,"This movie is approximately 2  hours of practically non-stop action coupled with some beautiful shots of Prague, Dubai, Russia, Mumbai India and Budapest.  As expected, there are some awesome stunts (like the promo where you saw Cruise climbing around the outside of a 130 story hotel).  The sand storm is neat, too.  As another reviewer said, the car (toward the end of the film) is awesome.  This movie is well worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen and you will most certainly want the DVD when it becomes available.

The movie begins in Budapest where an agent is killed over Russian nuclear launch codes.  Next, we travel to Moscow for a jail break, signaling Ethan's (Cruise) pre-planned escape.  Ethan must impersonate a Russian general and break into the Kremlin, but as he is leaving the Kremlin, parts of it blow up.  The bad guy is a nuclear extremist who is hell-bent on buying the codes and launching a nuclear device. So, the struggle is stopping the bad guys. Because the Kremlin blast appears to be an act of aggression, the IMF officially shuts down their operation.  Ethan's team must go it alone (hence, Ghost Protocol).

A very exciting movie.",1324944000,,1181,4.740196078431373
4364649,4,B004EPYZUS,"UPDATED FOR BLU-RAY:

A couple of things about the Blu-ray edition 1) Paramount has done a stunning transfer with nice depth, clarity and detail. Skin tones look quite nice as do textures. The audio is VERY active with a great losslss 7.1 mix.

Be aware however that the sequences shot in IMAX format are NOT presented in the wider aspect ratio for the film (unlike, say, ""The Dark Knight""). Also this includes a code for a Ultraviolet ""copy"" which means you'll have to stream the film rather than upload it to your portable device. There's also a code for itunes as well if you go that route.

The special features are good for the two disc editions but I am a bit disappointed that we don't get a feature length commentary track from Brad Bird and tom Cruise but we do get Bird's commentary for the deleted scenes and alternate opening sequence for the film. We also get featurettes on the dust storm sequence (a truly amazing sequence in a film filled with them) as well as ""Mission Accepted"" with Cruise, J.J. Abrams and director Bird on set discussing the making of the film.

On the film:
When Tom Cruise lost it a couple of years back it impacted my ability to enjoy the films he was in and for a long while I avoided them. Having said that, I enjoyed ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" and found it to be the most consistently entertaining of the four films produced in the ""MI"" film series. Bringing director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"", ""The Iron Giant"")best known for his CGI films made with Pixar was a wise move--Bird proved that he had the ability to make an exceptional thriller with involving characters even when they were CG and now he had the chance to prove he could do the same with live action thrillers.

SPOILERS:

The convoluted plot boils down to this: Ethan Hunt has been disavowed due to an operation that went awry and he's forced to work with an mysterious analyst named Brandt(Jeremey Renner ""The Hurt Locker"" and forthcoming ""Avengers""), Jane (Paula Patton ""Jumping the Broom"")and the only member of his team that he's worked with before Benji (Simon Pegg ""Paul"", ""Star Trek"") now a field operative. Hunt's team can't rely on anybody within IMF because the organization is being blamed for the destruction of a military facility in the Kremlin. Hunt discovers that Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist of the original ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"")a dangerous terrorist has active launch codes for a Russian nuclear device and plans on using it to start a nuclear war.

END OF SPOILERS:

A well made thriller with some truly astonishing action set pieces including a scene where Hunt must scale the tallest building in the world in Dubai, ""Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol"" truly delivers on its promise and is, quite possibly, the best of the four films that Tom Cruise as starred in and co-produced. The writing by Andr Nemec and Josh Applebaum (both ""Alias"" alumni working with ""Alias"" creator J.J. Abrams as co-producer of the film)focuses on developing the plot not so much the characters in the film (although a cursory attempt is made with the IMF team)but then these type of films aren't about developing character as much as it is to create just enough to help the plot fly.

The action is nonstop in ""M:IGP"" and fans looking for a spectaular display of explosions/action sequences won't be disappointed. The main flaw of the film is the lack of character development and the use of familiar faces (Jeremey Renner, Josh Holloway in a cameo, Tom Wilkinson)to help flesh out characters that aren't given much screen time to develop but, as I mentioned earlier, that's really not the point of ""M:IGP"".",1324944000,54,3638,4.771065182829889
4364650,1,B004EPYZUS,"Today, the ruling ideology could be found in the realm of the popular culture, first and foremost the movies. It is easy to dismiss this movie as an innocent light entertainment, but I think it is not that simple. What we are consuming is ideology of a specific kind, an ideology of caricaturing the other cultures, while asserting a dominance of the Western norms. I think ""Ghost Protocol"" incites fear, loathing, and ridicule vis-a-vis the ""Orient"" in a jokey kind of manner.

""Orient"" is not a geographical term, but a cultural one. It is a gap that separated ""the West"" form ""the Rest"". The hallmarks are: a reflexive cultural contempt and even mild racism, expressed in patronizing superiority vis--vis other cultures. It has become, with few exceptions, a common thing in the Hollywood today.  For me, as a Russian-American, it looks like Russia has been placed firmly by the Hollywood in the realm of cultural ""Orient"". In this particular film, Russia was portrayed as a backward, dangerous, Byzantine country once more. Starting with the music -- they chose a grim, ominous music for the beginning of the ""Moscow"" scene.

A group of likable American spies sent to take down a world-threatening baddie, sort of a ""Consigliery"" to the Russian government. The plot in brief: the crazed Russian wants to incite nuclear war so that the planet may be cleansed and born anew, and he's doing the ""pit two nuclear powers against each other"" gimmick to make it happen. After the spies are implicated in a terrorist attack in Moscow, which destroyed the Kremlin, they went first to Dubai and then to Mumbai to clear their names by catching this guy ""red-handed"".

The music, the military uniforms, and all other intangibles - all this suggest to us a militaristic, aggressive, and anti-Western nature of Russia. The crazed Russian politician - curiously -- has a Germanic name ""Kurt"". Thus, the remorseful scriptwriters Nemec and Appelbaum have fused the pre-supposed ""Prussian militarism"", and perhaps quasi-Nazi ideas with the Russian ""Oriental Despotism"" and the ostensible technological backwardness of Russia.

That the Russians are backward is emphasized by the clich that ostensibly nothing in Russia works (for example, the ""pay-phone"" scene). They also can be easily fooled by Ethan Hunt, could pretend to be a Russian without them noticing it. The ethnic divisions have been exploited once more (why not?) -- between the Russians and Ukrainians, between Serbs and Croats. The spies' helper is Bogdan, which in Russia is considered a Ukrainian name. Tom Cruise was thrown into Moscow prison for, supposedly, shooting six Serbs who ostensibly had been involved in the ""ethnic cleansing"".

In my view, there have been three slurring ""shots"" at the Russians: 1] for putting innocent people in prison (the rule of law is absent), 2] for having the nukes which are not secure enough (backwardness), 3] for not having the brains to come up with the devilish scheme themselves (unsophistication). Thus, we are presented with Swedish-German ""Kurt"" who came up with the crypto-fascist idea to clean the Earth form the ""rabble"" using the Russian nuclear weapon. He pulls the strings in Kremlin, not even a native Russian guy.

As usual with the Hollywood, all ""Russian"" scenes have been filmed in the Czech Republic. The producers didn't even bother to pick the native Russian speakers. Russian wasn't a native language of the ""Russians"" in prison scene and other ""Moscow"" scenes, except a single person - Vladimir Mashkov who played a Russian secret agent. All this looks and sounds really idiotic and incredibly patronizing. The movie is a collection of disconnected action ""packages"", TV series stitched together with white threads (Moscow-Dubai-Mumbai episodes). Appelbaum and Nemec's script are too jokey without being genuinely funny. In my opinion, they have created a dazzling array of techno-tricks that tries to be funny ""ad nauseam"" while making caricatures of the other cultures.",1324944000,12,3987,5.162538699690402
4364651,5,B004EPYZUS,"To me it has always been the theme song. I could watch just about anything to that sound track and think it was great. Fortunately we had a great film that explodes on the big screen. The gadgets were extremely high tech and I seriously doubt many of them really exist. Face scanner in a contact lens?

The opening scene of Cruise in a Serbian high security prison being broken out, was superb. It becomes a mystery that plays constantly in the back of your mind during the film. Who was the man he took with him when escaped? Where is he now? It engages you and puts your mind into the proper framework. Tom Cruise is later written off along with the IMF and must operate rouge to save the US from terrorist named Hendricks who has the Russian launch codes and plans to use them against the US. Cruise's team are the guys that just happened to be with him at the moment...with no masks!  Great Stuff.

This is a good old fashion break out the tub of popcorn and enjoy the feature action-comedy-thriller. I didn't see it in IMAX, but clearly that is the way to go considering how the scenes were shot. After seeing it once, I want to see it again on the really big screen.  And of course every ""impossible"" scene is made more complex, complicated, or twisted. Humorous and heart stopping action all in the same moment. Can you say Oscar?

Good Luck.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1324857600,4,1378,4.3843137254901965
4364652,4,B004EPYZUS,"As I expected with Brad Bird directing, MI:GP is well and carefully constructed. It's fast paced but unrushed. The characters are distinct; their interactions fun and credible. The action is intense, the stakes are high, and the whole thing is leavened with a good amount of humor. And some of the stuff Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt suffers caused me to wince and cringe in sympathetic pain.

I'd quibble in a couple of places: not a fan of the title sequence that basically previews the movie, and Ethan Hunt falls off of things just one too many times prompting my daughter and I both to laugh where that was obviously not the intended response. Still, a respectable action flick and an interesting addition to animation director Brad Bird's resume.",1324857600,,746,4.828125
4364653,5,B004EPYZUS,"Say what you will about Tom Cruise's off-screen life, but onscreen this man is box office gold, consistently producing hit after hit. M:I GP is the latest in the franchise and it's non-stop adrenaline. I saw it on opening night and left happy. On paper, everything about this film looks good. Directed by Brad Bird (Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, all good movies), produced by J. J. Abrams (Star Trek, Super 8, M:I III) and Cruise (you don't need me to list his film creds, do you?), that's one hell of a creative team. I loved M:III and if you thought the action there was intense, the filmmakers turned it up to 12 for Ghost Protocol.

They took the best elements of the entire franchise, trimmed off the boring expository bits, boiled down the rest, and gave us pure M:I brain-melting espionage action. There's really not much espionage and cloak and dagger double-crossy trickery going on to confuse thicker moviegoers. They cut to the chase (quite literally) and stick with action. It's a cold open (skipped credits) with a guy busting through the door on the roof, chased by two bad guys armed with SMGs. (We know he's the good guy because he's handsome.) He pulls some kind of button on his chest, jumps off the roof, and kills his pursuers before landing on his inflate-a-pack. This film has all the movie-going goodness you need: exotic international locales, scientifically impossible gadgets, physics defying acrobatics, car chases (and car crashes), foot chases, fisticuffs, guns, stuff blowing up, and stuff blowing up. Excuse me? Oh, I repeated myself? Here, I'll do it again. Stuff blowing up. Lots of stuff blows up. They blow up the Kremlin. The Kremlin!!

The film is filled with very likable and excellent actors. The funny, but typecasted Simon Pegg (Star Trek, Shaun of the Dead), Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker), and the drop-dead gorgeous Paula Patton round out the cast, with Tom Wilkinson making a cameo (one of my favorite actors). Throw in some Russians, Cold War nuclear tech, and a brilliant but insane (and insanely athletic) middle-aged Swedish guy who wants to destroy the world and you've got a story. If that doesn't sound like popcorn munching good times, I don't know what does.

As with all action movies, expect ridiculous, over-the-top action and leaps of logic. Why did Agent Hunt have to cut a hole in the tallest building in the world (Burj Khalifa, Dubai), climb on the outside of it unharnessed with Spiderman gloves of questionable reliability to reach a server room 5 stories up and 30 feet across? Because if he took the elevator, you wouldn't pay $10+ to see that. The action is consistent, interrupted at no time for more than several minutes for some story-telling. There's a fight, a chase, or some crazy stunt probably every five minutes, it seemed, along with some bits of understated humor (supplied mostly by Pegg's character). You get to see some fantastic location shots of Moscow, the UAE, and Mumbai (India) for the finale. The aerials over the Dubai desert and approach, for example, I'll probably never see in real life, so it's a treat to see on the big screen. The car at the end of the movie is off the chain (a BMW concept car)!

I was thoroughly entertained by this film and enthusiastically recommend it to action fans. Movies aren't cheap in NY ($13.50), but nothing feels quite as bad as wasting not just money, but 2 hours on a bad movie, so I choose what films I watch very carefully. It's made by smart filmmakers who have a solid reputation and delivers a very sleekly choreographed action film without any eye-rolling stupidity. Waiting for the next film in the franchise already!",1324771200,,3661,4.8155802861685215
4364654,4,B004EPYZUS,"MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is a perfect popcorn summer movie, never mind that it's coming out in wintertime. It doesn't try to be more than what it is. It harbors no pretense to high-minded Merchant Ivory ideals. It merely wants to entertain the bejesus out of you with a barrage of fun explosive espionage. All it asks is a suspension of disbelief and, since this is Christmas time, accomodating them folks at Bad Robot isn't so far a stretch. This franchise has always been hugely entertaining if you're into crazy cloak and dagger and action sequences contrived with audacity and flair. The stunt crew wore their big boy pants for this one.

What mission is so crucial that it requires a languishing Ethan Hunt to be sprung from a Russian gulag? This time out the McGuffin centers around Russian nuclear launch codes and the nuclear extremist codenamed ""Cobalt"" who seeks to make use of them. Ethan, still recovering from his wife's death, is saddled with a new crew. It comprises vengeful-minded operative Jane Carter (Paula Patton, drop-dead gorgeous), new field agent and resident tech-head Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, very funny), and seemingly out-of-his-depth IMF (Impossible Missions Force) chief analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner). It turns out this team doesn't play too well with each other. When the caper in Moscow goes disastrously south - and exploded bits of the Kremlin would attest to how rough it all went - the U.S. President initiates Ghost Protocol which mandates the disavowal of the IMF. Short on support and resources, Ethan Hunt has no recourse but to put on a hoodie and regroup with his newly declared rogue operatives.

Brad Bird, who helmed IRON GIANT and THE INCREDIBLES, transitions to live action directing and makes it look easy. Of course, it helps when you have an icon like Tom Cruise headlining the project, but, really, nothing about the production values look cheap. The film makes use of exotic locales as what's left of IMF travels from Budapest to Russia to Dubai to Mumbai. The spy gadgets are cool - the blink-activated eye lens camera, the edifice-scaling suction gloves, the magnetic flotation device, etc. - even if they all almost universally end up betraying their operators. But that's part of the fun. It would be horrid if these spy strategies work seamlessly.

I would've loved to have seen more of Paula Patton in action because she seems to have the physicality to sell ""Jane Carter"" as a buttkicking spy. But her much anticipated showdown with the female assassin is a bust. Meanwhile, Simon Pegg can show up on anything and I'll watch it. He's awesome; he never fails to add comedic color. Jeremy Renner does exhibit several wicked good moves in various confrontations. Word on the street is that whenever Cruise decides to step down, Renner's set to fill in those shoes. It should be fine, providing you take into consideration that Renner doesn't carry a smidge of Cruise's star wattage.

Tom Cruise has mastered the blueprint for playing that relentless, undaunted super-spook. And you have to respect the shape he's in and his nerves of steel because there's no way in the world would I have scaled the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, only, like, the tallest building in the world (there's some silly plot point about having to access the tower's server room on the 130th floor from the exterior). Cruise performs this stunt himself, and somewhere maybe his stunt double is wiping his sweaty brow in relief. These action set pieces are spectacular stuff. And because it's dull when the super spy is too indomitable, I like the running gag which centers on Ethan Hunt's jumping misadventures; all his desperate leaps end up with his just missing the mark. It's nice to see a chink in his armor. But, holy carp, this guy's pain threshold must be unbelievable. Ethan Hunt takes a hellacious beating in this film that I don't think even wearing a fresh stylish leather hoodie can make up for.",1324771200,,3955,4.889716840536512
4364655,5,B004EPYZUS,"""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol""  is a film that carefully blends non-stop action with riveting plot schemes.  Tom Cruise brilliantly portrays a fighter named Ethan Hunt.  Ethan has the adversarial task of battling criminal elements while adhering to discretion.  Paula Patton gives a strong performance as the headstrong and astute assistant Jane Carter.  A desire for vengeance drives Jane to help Ethan.  There was natural rapport between the interactions of Tom Cruise and Paula Patton.  Please understand that I also felt that Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg powerfully portrayed their roles as Ethan's right hand men very well. It is just that something in the intense performances of Tom Cruise and Paula Patton compel me to check them both out in their future movies.

8427347,5,B004EPYZUS,"The best Mission: Impossible film yet!

Brad Bird has absolutely reinvented what a Mission: Impossible movie is capable of with this latest installment into this decades long action franchise. Bird has directed Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol with a cool contemporary eye for gorgeous cinematography like the sandstorm overtaking Dubai to IMF agent Ethan Hunt vanishing into fog like a ghost. We are treated to a visual feast that will surely appease die hard fans of the M:I franchise and new viewers alike. Bird's direction is the very best the series has to offer with creative close-ups and sleek shots in every scene. His quick pacing and easy to enjoy narrative makes Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol the greatest film in the Mission: Impossible franchise to date. Brad Bird has surpassed the skillful directors preceding him in the Mission: Impossible canon including Brian DePalma, John Woo, and J.J. Abrams.

The audience is constantly engaged with new exotic locales from Moscow and Dubai to Mumbai and Seattle. Ghost Protocol is an entertaining tour of the world just like the previous M:I movies have been.

Yet, the stakes are even higher and the action is even more intense. Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world for real, navigates through a sandstorm, and leaps from car to car in a high rise parking complex for a brutal finale. The combat is more visceral and well choreographed than any previous Mission: Impossible movie. Overall, Ghost Protocol gives you exhilarating action and constantly impressive stunts. All audiences will certainly enjoy the spectacle.

Another unique aspect to Ghost Protocol is the excellent writing. It is easily the most well written sequel in the series. The consistent quality of the humor leads to delightful quips and jokes that always land. Dialogue that is actually witty is what the Mission: Impossible movies have sorely missed. Gone are the days of corny one-liners and dated references in this franchise. You will laugh more than you expected on this absolute blast of a blockbuster.

The story is quite engaging and easy to follow. I appreciate Brad Bird's narrative focus being more on developing interesting characters than endlessly rehashing the political spy thriller cliches of the past films. We get a character study of Ethan Hunt and deeper emotional attachment to his team than ever before. We get the spy espionage with all the genre's usual twists and turns, while also developing Ethan Hunt's character into a significantly deeper man rather than the goofy perfect Hunt of old. There is a crazy villain as always, but the focal point remains of Hunt's character developing and leading his IMF squad. It is much more mature than the original trilogy of movies.

Michael Giacchino's music is a completely new arrangement for Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. He tenderly accompanies the emotional moments with delicate care that are so sweet, you will think the score is on a new level. The most neat feature of Giacchino's score this time around is that there are multi-faceted layers to the soundtrack that sonically reference the various cultural areas that we see Ethan Hunt visit. When in The Kremlin, Russian themes match the moment, while in Dubai, similar fitting musical elements complement the scene. It is a score that is simultaneously rousing in suspense for the tense sequences as well as often delving into beautiful passages. I like Giacchino's compositions quite a bit for Ghost Protocol.

Acting-wist, Ghost Protocol ramps up the believable performances with this newest cast of characters. First of all, Tom Cruise is as thoroughly thrilling and entertaining as ever. Cruise continues to prove why he is still a massive box office draw and the biggest action icon alive. His combat is fierce. His delivery of dialogue is biting and earnest, while he always attracts your attention to his every movie. Cruise is cool.

Meanwhile, Simon Pegg is hilarious as Agent Benji, who is rife with lovable comedy relief. Paula Patton plays the awesome Agent Jane whose combat is as killer as Hunt's fights. Jeremy Renner doubled down on the comedy while also additionally providing backup gunfire on occasion. The various Russian actors are excellent and really fun foils and antagonists for Ethan Hunt to test his skills alongside. If you watch until the end, you will also be treated with some sweet cameos for fans of the franchise. Finally, the lovely La Seydoux kills it as the French assassin Sabine Moreau. She is certainly one of the best villains Hunt has had to contend with lately.

In all, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol is the pinnacle of modern day action movies. It remains my favorite film in the entire Mission: Impossible franchise. Brad Bird proves he can direct an action thriller with the best of them. Ghost Protocol revitalizes this series for even the most dejected and jaded action cinema movie goer.",1526169600,,4927,5.09541511771995
