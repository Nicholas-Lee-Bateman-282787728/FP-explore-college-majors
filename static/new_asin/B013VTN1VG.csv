Great performance and nice production.  It looks great in Bluray.",1456617600,4,204,4.611111111111111
8728907,5,B013VTN1VG,"Erato has re-released several favorite opera discs in Blu ray that were not previously available in that format. Having now seen all five, I can opine that all were outstandingly successful. My December 2014 review of the original release described it as ""perfect"", but it should have read ""almost perfect"", the flaw being the failure to release it back then in Blu ray. That is because the differences are quite pronounced.

The quality of the picture is much improved if one views it on an HD flat screen TV. The sharpness, definition and color quality have to bee experienced, and I am one who owns many Blu ray discs. The sound is still 5.1, rather than HD MA, so one might qibble a bit on that aspect of the disc, but not I. One is left with a simply splendid performance of an opera that went unperformed for many years.  In fact the performance history of Maria Stuarda (including the rehearsal brawl between the two original female leads) has been fairly well documented and makes for interesting reading if one enjoys such things (as I do).

Of course, the quality of the performance relies primarily on the efforts of the singers, chorus and orchestra, as well as the imagination of the stage director and production crew. In that context, this disc deserves its five star rating without considering the technical aspects of the disc. But when those qualities are added, one has a memorable operatic experience.

I got my copy from a UK seller, because it was available much earlier than in the US. I also note that the disc is NOT Region 2 as described by Amazon on its product page; rather it is Region 0, playable world wide, BUT only on Blu ray players, not generic DVD machines.

Gentle reader, this is a ""do not miss"" recording; get it!",1446854400,9,1752,4.620578778135048
