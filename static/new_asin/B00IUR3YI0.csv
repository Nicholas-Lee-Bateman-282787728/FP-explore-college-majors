6297374,5,B00IUR3YI0,"'Chain of Command' is my favorite two-parter so I was excited this episode was chosen as the standalone to accompany Season Six.  I know a lot of fans feel like CBS-D is double-dipping and gouging fans, but you have to remember:

The budgets for the full-season sets are fixed.  It's easy to say ""these extra features could have been added to the full season set,"" but in reality that is not true.  I don't really purchase the standalone discs for the episodes, I purchase them for the documentaries and the deleted scenes and whatever commentary is provided.  Producing a standalone disc gives the team at CBS-D that produces the new bonus material an extra, albeit smaller, budget to work with.

If you're a TNG fan who simply cares about the HD restoration - and you really don't care for the documentaries, deleted scenes, and commentary - I would say this release is not for you.  You can still enjoy ""Chain of Command"" in two parts on the Season Six set.  If you like all the added extras this is for you.",1403654400,10,1011,4.54696132596685
6297375,4,B00IUR3YI0,"For the record, I have a pre-release copy of this title (obtained from the studio) that I also reviewed for DVD Talk.

Those following ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""'s release on Blu-ray should be familiar with CBS/Paramount's strategy of stand-alone releases alongside the excellent season collections. ""The Best of Both Worlds"" was the first such stand-alone release, offering a seamless edit of the popular episode and a few exclusive extras. ""Redemption"" followed suit: it wasn't as good of an episode, but the exclusive extras made it worth a look.  ""Unification"" was actually a two-part episode from Season Five (not a season finale/opener), which meant that anyone who bought the full season set would only be getting this for the extras (and the slightly new cut, of course).

""Chain of Command"" (a two-parter from Season Six) is one of TNG's very best episodes, hands down.  In just a matter of minutes, it shakes things up nicely and eventually shows us Picard in a much more vulnerable light.  His scenes with the ruthless Gul Lemec (Daivd Warner, who acted with Partick Stewart in the Royal Shakespeare Company) are second to none, and the Enterprise crew's relationship with acting Captain Jellico (Ronny Cox) are terrific too.  CBS has once again stepped up to the plate with a flawless A/V presentation, which involved assembling the newly-scanned original film footage to replace the material that was previously edited on videotape.  It's outstanding work that will impress new fans and give old ones yet another reason to appreciate this series.

I've come to terms with these TNG stand-alone releases, since the ""exclusive"" extras are created for them and not deliberately held back from the Season Six collection.  Once again, these extras include a full-length audio commentary, a 30-minute retrospective documentary, over 10 minutes' worth of deleted scenes and the original TV promos for both parts.  The participants in the audio commentary and documentary are a mix of cast and crew members, and Ronny Cox is even part of both of them this time around!  He seems humble and gracious for his brief time in TNG and contributes some great stories.

So as a whole, this stand-along release is probably the best of its kind to date.  IMO, ""Chain of Command"" is the strongest of these two-parters (even slightly better than ""Best of Both Worlds""), the A/V quality is flawless and the extras are great too.  Buy Season Six first but don't hesitate to grab this too!",1403222400,11,2485,5.029268292682927
6297376,5,B00IUR3YI0,"Many are unaware that Paramount had already released all the seamlessly edited 2-part Next Generation episodes in a 10 tape VHS PAL box set in the UK. They may have also been available separately but I have yet to see an individual tape show up. Problem is not only it being VHS and the PAL format but I havn't seen one cheap enough to encourage me to buy. Also the date- which is hard to read in the pics, looks like it says 2004. The latest one is on eBay under the title ""Star Trek: The Next Generation TV Movies-Complete Series of 10 VHS-PAL Format"".

But now, were FINALLY getting these here in the U.S. with not only the DVD but Blu-Ray treatment - and individual packaging. So far we've seen a few released like ""Redemption [Blu-ray] (2013)"" ""Unification [Blu-ray] (2013)"", ""The Best of Both Worlds (Blu-ray +UltraViolet) (2014) And now Chain of Command. Hopefully we'll see the the rest released so that we collectors won't have to look for that overpriced VHS PAL box floating around out there.

My 5 star rating is for the anticipated usual quality these have thus far been put out in and for Paramount finally getting off their bootays and releasing them in the U.S.-though certainly from their standpoint, it's just more moolah from the franchise.",1402185600,2,1259,4.666666666666667
6297377,5,B00IUR3YI0,"As usual, the Amazon Community is showing its idiotic side with its users reviewing products that they don't even own or, in this case, particularly understand.  Because of that, I'm forced to write yet another review just to negate the reviews of people complaining about such nonsense as 'double dipping,"" which has zero bearing on the quality of the product.

Since A. Hutch decided to pull his head out of his Dynasty DVDs and 3-ring binders that he mysoginistically reviewed and share his opinion of a Blu-ray title that he hasn't seen, doesn't own and has no intention of owning while lacing his review with clever expressions from the late 80s/early 90s (which in retrospect is kind of appropriate from a nostalgic perspective when doing a review of a TNG product), I thought it only fair that I respond to him personally and then write my own rebuttal review to straighten out any misconceptions surrounding these double-episode TNG Blu-ray releases.

First, I'll address the misconceptions (by basically copying and pasting what I said to Mr. Hutch, and trimming it a bit).

Although Mr. Hutch would argue otherwise, this isn't being released for the audio commentary track (I can't really comment as to whether or not the season six set has the same audio commentaries or not... as, like this title, it's not out yet and that information isn't available) or to take more money out of the pockets of Star Trek fans for no reason. It's being released for two reasons: 1.) Because it's a fan/critical favorite and it's a great teaser for fans sitting on the fence on whether to commit to TNG on BD or not. 2.) It's not the same presentation that's in the season six set.  Like the Best of Both Worlds, Redemption and Unification BD releases before this, the two episodes have been combined seamlessly into one feature-length presentation, which, believe it or not, is actually of some value to some consumers, just as the individual episodes have value for the purists. They haven't done it for all of the two-part episodes and they aren't going to.  They didn't do it for Time's Arrow, they won't do it for Birthright and it's incredibly unlikely that they'll do it for Descent or Gambit.  You know why?  No demand for them. That being said, the previous double-episode releases have all been incredibly successful so that should probably tell you something as far as consumer response to them.

Despite what Mr. Hutch claims, NO ONE has paid ""upwards of $90"" for ANY of the single-season sets of TNG on BD.  Every single season dropped to $59.97 on release day.  Oh, and the single disc double-ep releases have all dropped to $14.99 on release day, as well.  They are simply nice little cheap extras for collectors who want them.  CBS is still including both individual episodes on the season six release so you aren't forced to buy them to complete your collection of Blu-ray episodes.

Now, as for the quality of video/audio...

Although, I haven't seen it yet, I don't really think I have to in order to accurately comment on it.  Considering the well-documented 4K remastering for 1080p BD with all re-composited visual effects (and in some cases, re-done via CG) and the DTS-HD MA remix of the audio track on the prior five seasons (that's about 130 episodes for those keeping score), I think it's probably safe to say that the same attention to quality and detail present on the prior releases will also be present on this release.

Episode(s) review:

For myself, as far as the episodes go, Chain of Command, Part 2 is superior to Chain of Command Part 1.  They are really like totally different episodes having not much to do with each other.  I'm still a little perplexed as to why this was a two-parter and not just a two-part arc,and yes, there is a difference.  Two part-episodes like Best of Both Worlds or Unification are simply two halves of the same story.  Chain of Command has basically two different stories with a unifying arc to it.  Part 1 is about Jellico taking command of the Enterprise for the Cardassian negotiations and Picard training for the secret mission and Part 2 is basically the ""let's torture Picard"" episode. Seriously, if you haven't seen it in a while, do you really remember what happened in Part 2 other than Picard getting tortured?  It took me re-watching it again to remind myself.

Why this is less of a two-parter than it is a two-episode arc is very simply this: In Part One, the ""A"" storyline revolved around Jellico and the Cardassian negotiations and the ""B"" storyline revolved around Picard and his secret assignment (which was a little ludicrous to begin with, but I digress).  In Part 2, the Picard storyline became the ""A"" storyline and the Jellico storyline became the ""B"" storyline.  Like I said, great for an arc, but it doesn't make for seamless feature-film type viewing, which is why this release is a little perplexing to me... other than the fact that it is very popular.  Birthright does the same thing but that won't be released as a stand-alone so it's a moot discussion.

Although I certainly recognize that Part 2 is the better of the two episodes, Part 1 probably would have been better remembered and better received had the story been in an arc instead of a two-parter and thusl, Part 1 has been constantly compared to Part 2.  As brilliant as David Warner was as Picard's torturer, Gul Madred, people tend to forget how brilliant Ronny Cox was in BOTH episodes as the very un-Picard-like Captain Richard Jellico.  He had that character down cold. It's unfortunate that his performance has been so incredibly overshadowed.

So, at the end of the day my rating goes like this (use Metacritic as your reference for my ratings):

Chain of Command, Part 1: 73/100
Chain of Command Part 2: 95/100

Overall: 88/100",1395705600,95,5788,4.766533066132265
6297378,5,B00IUR3YI0,"Chain of Command is one of the great Star Trek episodes of all time. The two-parter is riveting, intense, and exciting. Are there four lights or five? Will Picard get his ship back? I'm glad they are releasing this on Blu-Ray and I hope they do the same thing with other two-part episodes.",1395705600,5,289,4.471698113207547
6297379,5,B00IUR3YI0,"Obviously I can't review this particular product, as it has not been released yet... but I had to bump up the rating  lol

I'm sure the episode will look great in blu ray, and it should be a good preview as to how some of the other Cardassians (Garak, Dukat, Damar, etc.) will look in future blu ray releases (HINT HINT CBS).",1395187200,6,325,4.225806451612903
6297380,2,B00IUR3YI0,"This one was kind of grim, torturey and psychologically intense, and some folks loved it and some folks didn't find it terribly exciting. Well acted and well done (and includes David Warner as yet another Star Trek character). Just not a favorite two-parter, and hopefully they'll keep releasing the two-parters as seamless blu rays. These are super cool and our family has enjoyed all of them so far, just probably skipping this one in particular and waiting eagerly for the next one, hoping lower possible sales of this one don't hold up future releases like this.
Hope this is helpful to fellow TNG fans!",1395100800,7,607,4.846153846153846

6297385,3,B00IUR3YI0,"Not that  great of a story line. Sound and picture needs improvement. The picture seems slightly cloudy. It's just a tad soft. Could be intentional. But who knows. Nice extras, and commentaries...One major gripe is the obvious places where commercials would go. I don't see why the two episodes are not edited better to get rid of these ""breaks"". Also the picture quality is different throughout.. Decent surround. But not totally engulfing...If you have the box set then stick with it.

6297390,5,B00IUR3YI0,"I really like these two-part episodes being condensed down into single-disk movies.  This episode is darker than most TNG stories, because it tries to deal with the subject of torture of prisoners.  The script is a little forced, because of all the people in Starfleet, Jean-Luc Picard has to be selected for this mission, and what should take months had to be compressed into 45 minutes.  But I really like the interplay between Picard and his Cardassian captor.  ""There are FOUR lights!""  The Blu-Ray quality seems good to me.",1406505600,3,528,4.887640449438202

Well, I got THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS for the extras, and that and the low prices on these made me order all the rest a day later!
I love em. And I love the full movie-like experience. And the quality of sound and visual is rich and satisfying. But even more than that, I love the care, joy, and info with which the makers have infused the extras! The docs are great and in old all cast members, which is rare even in some huge movies, and the commentary tracks, which I rarely get excited enough to even try, are so enveloping and informative, they give a deeper level of enjoyment. I can't believe these were made and with such care--so luckily they did so just before the bottom dropped out of the physical media industry.
These extras, if you didn't know, are NOT included on the season blu-rays or the complete box set. The makers were given more budget to do more (thankfully) when the studio decided to make these 2-part episodes available as stand-alone movies with the ep's edited together. .
For the price they've fallen to now, it's really an easy decision to get em. I'm so glad I did!",1503187200,,1321,4.418032786885246
