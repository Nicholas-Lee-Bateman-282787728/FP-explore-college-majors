7905497,2,B000009HNV,"This thinly produced comedy enjoyed a strong position at the box office during a brief run upon its release in Hong Kong, as its vacuous scenario, while not supported by an adequate budget, benefits from the casting of very popular film and entertainment business performers.  Director Cheung Ji-Kok, for his unpersuasive initial effort, divides the story's lightweight script credit with Hoi Dik, while familiar Hong Kong film actors Cherie Chung, Jacky Cheung, Elaine Kam (Jin), Melvin Wong, Lowell Lo, and Sally Kwok lead the cast, largely against type.  Action opens as we view John Chen, played by pop singer Jacky Cheung, along with his lover Mary Hwang (Chung), a couple that have been living together for two years, a perfect arrangement in the opinion of commercial photographer John who, although in love with Mary, does not want the lack of personal freedom in addition to other restrictions that come with marriage.  Their married close friends Zhang Pao Niu (Lo) and Hsaio Pao (Kwok) upset this comfortable situation of John and Mary when they present their infant child for the latter duo to care for after the baby's grandmother, its normal caretaker, must visit the Chinese mainland, and the tot's parents wish to avoid their proper progenitorial duties.  As may be predicted, the presence of Baby Snow White (from seven birthmarks - dwarves - upon the sole of a foot) arouses, at full tilt, maternal instincts in Mary, who then begins a series of unsubtle ploys in an attempt to become pregnant by an unwilling John, who is strongly against any alteration of their non-parental mode.  An ancillary sub-plot becomes meshed with John and Mary's debate, regarding Mary's vivacious older sister Daphne, played by Elaine Kam (Jin), and her philandering architect husband Dick (Melvin Wong).  The sisters decide to desert their mates and to share an apartment, with the two men therefore facing the task of  regaining their affection.  Dick's assignation with a harlot leads him to suspect that he has contracted the AIDS virus and he depends upon John's sympathy to ease his panicky state.  Wong gains the acting honours in the film and there are enjoyable cameos from director / actors Corey Yuen and Wu Ma who are cast as neighbours giving assistance to the two sisters with their process of moving into a new apartment, one of the better scenes in the film thanks to the performing felicities provided by the cinema veterans.  Lo and, to a lesser extent, Cheung, are each chargeable for gratingly turgid hamminess, despite the latter's pop song success, ""Sky Changes, Earth Changes, Love Never Changes"" that is heard to good effect as the picture's theme.  The work has been released upon a Fortune Star DVD that offers excellent visual quality.  Both Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks are provided as are optional English subtitles.",1301443200,,2849,5.051172707889126
