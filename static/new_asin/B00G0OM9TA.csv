6042800,2,B00G0OM9TA,Probably the worst acting I've seen in a horror movie. I'd suggest skip this one.,1447804800,3,81,4.466666666666667

6042810,1,B00G0OM9TA,"The only non-white character is an ignorant, perverted, ex-con.  Everyone treats him like crap.  Racist caricatures are the only thing that could make this flaming garbage heap of a movie any worse, and the writer nailed it.",1461196800,2,224,5.027027027027027
6042811,1,B00G0OM9TA,"If you want to see fake breasts, some blood, and a lot of atrocious acting, I suggest this movie. I made it fifty minutes in (while multitasking) and asked myself ""Why am I still watching this?"" Perhaps there's something redeeming about it toward the end, but it was just so bad that I didn't care anymore. I definitely don't recommend paying to watch this. I watched it for free, and I still feel ripped off.",1460592000,5,409,4.466666666666667

6042817,2,B00G0OM9TA,for some reason I found it interesting just seeing how odd the acting was.....it had a terrible awfulness that kept me watching.........,1454544000,,136,5.2272727272727275
6042818,1,B00G0OM9TA,"This was bad... it was really bad.  If only the writers concentrated more on trying to make it a ""psychological thriller"" then, maybe... perhaps... it could've been better.

Do not recommend this at all!",1451692800,3,203,4.9411764705882355
6042819,3,B00G0OM9TA,"Pretty average, but at least had a high body count. Several folks enter old building and soon one of them gets possessed. Has all the right ingredients: girls who take showers, several slashings and the typical group of dumb characters, but it feels very been there, done that and without much energy.",1451260800,,301,4.8076923076923075
6042820,3,B00G0OM9TA,"I should've taken the advice from ""scarjosh"" on this one but since I didn't............

In the past year I've come to really enjoy horror/scary movies, well except for the true paranormal ones. They still freak me out. That said, I thought this movie would be one that I could actually like. I can only give a (very generous) 3 star rating to this movie. Every single aspect of this movie needs a serious improvement before it will actually be worth watching. Less than halfway through I was thinking about what other movie I want to watch because this one is so bad but then I was suckered back in by a joke which made me laugh and got my hopes up. In hindsight, the joke wasn't even that funny & I still regret wasting my time watching the movie till the end. I wouldn't dare purchase this movie. I only watched because it was free since it is one of the movies included in my Amazon Prime subscription.",1449446400,,906,4.392857142857143
6042821,1,B00G0OM9TA,God awful acting.  Wow can't express how bad this was.  High School plays have better acting,1449100800,2,92,4.6875

8619936,3,B00G0OM9TA,"I will give this 3 stars because it was a good effort. Different actors, more cohesive plot and it would have been better.",1501113600,,122,4.3478260869565215
8619937,2,B00G0OM9TA,"I actually watched this thing because of all the bad reviews.  I just wanted to see what made a movie so bad as to get such scathing reviews.  Figured I'd watch 10 minutes and be done.  But, I ended up watching the whole thing and giving it 2 stars for reasons below.

It is indeed bad.  Even the worst of movies usually have some spark of talent somewhere- some writer, actor, camera operator, or someone shows a bit of flare for artistry that indicates a potential for learning and moving up to at least toilet paper commercials.  But, not this turd.  It pretty much flat lines across the board.  Even the caterer on the movie set should never serve food to anyone again.

At the end of the movie, the producers showed the outtakes of bloopers during the ending credits.  This surprised me because I was really thinking they just did every scene with one take.  But, evidently there's some scraps on a cutting room floor that are worse than the scenes that made it into the movie.  I only watched a few of the outtakes, but they were as boring and flat as the movie.

It's so bad that even the most trivial goofs overshadowed the movie and distracted me from the convoluted and disjointed plot.  It takes place in a small county jail or large state prison (hard to say which one) built in 1906 and abandoned in the 1990's.  Cell phones don't work because, according to the sheriff, the ""walls and copper pipes"" block the signal.  So, there's a single landline phone in the building.  I'll let the copper pipes in an early 1900's building slide, but a working landline in a long abandoned building...really?

When the stereotypical bimbos on the team do the exploitation shower scene required of movies that have nothing else to offer, I'm not shouting, ""Martha, hold all the calls on the landline until I'm done oggling all this silicone!""  Instead, I'm thinking, ""Why is there running water in this old abandoned building?""  I guess it must be the superior cell phone blocking copper water pipes mandated by the 1906 International Building Code.  For that matter, why do the bimbos even take a shower halfway through the first day of a three day investigation?  Maybe they worked up such a sweat hiking around the jail or prison in short skirts.  Or maybe it's to titillate me.  But, I was far from titillated because I was still distracted trying to figure out why the team's two-way radios worked when cell phones didn't.  Maybe the 1906 IBC required selective signal blocking copper pipe.

At the end, the plot is neatly wrapped up when the heroine finds the neatly organized and complete inmate records that incriminate the doctor and sheriff still stored in this long abandoned building.  (Sorry, spoiler alert).  But, it's all hard to say because maybe the doctor and sheriff had nothing to do with the heroine's father being possessed by some 1920's serial killer (sorry, another spoiler alert).  I dunno....I wasn't tracking.  I was busy wondering if the county or state government can get a good deal on bundling broadband and cable with that landline.

One reviewer mentioned that there's some racism in this movie.  Yep.  Quite a few reviews mentioned the horrible acting.  Yep.

There's a hint of a sequel at the end when the overwrought brooding, introspective loner hero is chatting with his spirit guide (a ghost wearing a wife beater and sporting a ""F*K U"" tattoo on his shoulder whose story will unfold presumably in any unfortunate sequel).  Please- for the love of God, the Virgin Mary, and all that is holy- do not make a sequel.  Let the Southern redneck stereotype ghost move from this dimension to the next.  RIP, man.

All that said, I still can't say that I hated this movie.  The film makers did an honest effort and tried their best (""Aw, look it.  They made a movie.  It's beautiful.  I'm going to pin it on the refrigerator right next to little Suzy's water color of a kat."")  Because they tried so hard and it's still so bad, it's just too easy to make fun of.  Vessel is perfect fodder for MST3K.  Maybe Tom Servo can figure out why Hector, the stereotyped Hispanic armed robbing old lady stabbing convict, could find the pack of smokes and lighter in his old jail / prison cell's obvious hiding place and not be found by guards during a shakedown.  2 stars.",1500508800,,4292,4.6462765957446805

you knew this was going to be bad the moment you saw the hokey dopey ""special effects"" in the opening credits.
the music is abysmal as is the entire premise; and I'm not even sure what that was supposed to be.",1487808000,,314,4.526315789473684
