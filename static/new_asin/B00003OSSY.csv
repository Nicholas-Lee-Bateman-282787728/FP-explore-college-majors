1332081,5,B00003OSSY,The planet blew up...who didn't see this coming? Is goku really dead? No way! Why watch a show if the main character's dead? Is Frieza dead? Nope... OOPS! That was suposed to be a surprize! Oh well...HEY! VEGETA! WHERE ARE  YOU GOING!  To find Kakorot? But why...oh yeah...to learn the secret of  becoming a super saiyan. Just wait 2 years and your wish will come true!  This movie was pretty funny...Bulma's mom was trying to get on vegeta's  gooooood side. Sorry...he's already got a kid! Just wait until the Trunks  series comes to video.  The action will start up again with Goku and the  others!,952992000,4,600,4.647619047619048
1332082,5,B00003OSSY,"Dragonball Z is one of the most entertaining anime series ever made.  Funimation's UNCUT videos are a great way to own a piece of the saga. 'Frieza-Nameks End' contains some of the best episodes in season three.  By  the time this tape was produced, Funimation had worked out all the initial  problems they had in the begining of this season.  The background music was  fixed and the voice acting and dialogue have been improved tremendously.  Funimation really pulled it together this time and made a great video.  'Nameks End' contains the last (and best)four episodes of the Frieza Saga.  This video is well worth the price and is a must have for all fans of DBZ  and Anime.  Everyone needs this video!",952992000,3,705,4.69672131147541
1332083,3,B00003OSSY,"This is the final installment of the (incredibly drawn-out) Freeza saga...finally, Planet Namek has exploded, and Son Goku is nowhere to be found. Everyone assumes that he's dead, but in the next episode (where everyone killed during the previous arc, as well as in the battle with Nappa and Vegeta, comes back to life), it's revealed that he can't be brought back because...he's not quite dead! (How's that for a Monty Python cliffhanger!) Turns out Goku's escaped the planet, but isn't quite ready to come home yet. And so, the Earth returns to an uneasy peace, while the Namekians find a new home, and the other leads wonder when they'll see their friend again.
Overall, the dub for these episodes isn't that great...the music isn't nearly as good as the original, and many of the lines are changed. Most importantly, they glossed over the fact that Kuririn's *remains* had to be brought back to Earth for him to be revived there, making it seems as though only his ""spirit"" needed to be there (remember that the ""Other World"" encompasses the dead of all worlds, not just Earth). Porunga also reconstructed his body for free.
Luckily...all of this is rectified in the DVD version, which has the original Japanese episodes intact. So, if you can, get that instead.",952560000,,1266,4.838709677419355
7919210,5,B00003OSSY,Dbz season blu rayshipped on time and in mint condition. Really Satisfied. Good Job. Awesome. Great. Happy. Perfect. Very Happy. very pleased. Love it.,1402617600,,151,5.333333333333333
7919211,5,B00003OSSY,"This DVD is truly remarkable as it puts an end to the amazing Frieza Saga. The first episode shows the final destruction (well, at least until Trunks and stuff, but we'll leave it as that) of Frieza and includes many flash backs of the previous DVD's. The scene where Frieza get's destroyed is pure gold. (I love the manga dialoge. ""You must die by my hands. I will kill you!"" followed by Goku going, ""You fool!"" It's done almost perfectly in the Anime, but some of the dialoge is changed. It's still really great to watch.) The second episode shows Goku trying to get out alive and includes a little filler dual between Gohan and Vegeta.
The last episode surprises everyone (well, sort of, I mean the episode title does sort of give it away) and has everyone from Namek return. The conclusion is one that is truly amazing. I do, however, have a few complaints near the end. Why did Funimation put an episode preview to the Garlic Jr. Saga? It's something completey seperate and ussually at the end of a big saga, they just sort of end it. It's still good, I just found that weird. The DVD itself is good quality and has both the Japaneese Subbed version and the English Dubbed version. It has no bonus material, but that is to be expected. The DVD is deffinetaly worth a buy.",1074816000,,1276,4.457264957264957
7919212,4,B00003OSSY,"These are the best damn episodes I've ever seen in my life. When Frieza is sliced in half by his own disks ..., Goku, the kind-hearted super saiyan, offered some of his energy so that Frieza can survive in space. But he attacked Goku from behind with a blast and Goku had enough and ended the terror right there. But it was not over. Goku still has to manage to get off Namek before it explodes. But it was too late. The planet Namek no longer exists. Did Goku escape or has his life ended along with the planet? It turns out that he did survive, but why hasn't he returned home yet? Find out later on in the series!",1056585600,,616,4.141666666666667
7919213,4,B00003OSSY,"This is the last DVD from the Frieza saga. Frieza is defeated by super saiyan Goku. The saiyan warrior gives Frieza a little energy to escape the exploding planet Namek. Frieza sees flashbacks from the fight and can`t believe his defeat. In a last attempt to defeat Goku he fires an energy blast towards him. The blast backfires!!!
Very cool dvd",1046390400,,345,4.672131147540983
7919214,3,B00003OSSY,"Frieza has now lost it and flashbacks are shown of the fight between Goku and Frieza up until where they are now.  After Goku defeats Frieza, he desperately tries to find a way off Namek but can't and it appears that he blew up with the planet, but when he is wished back, the Dragon says he's still alive!  Yamcha, Tien, Chao-Tsu, and Krillin are wished back and everything wraps up nicely.  The reason I gave this DVD 3 stars is because for some reason the sound quality was really bad.  It might just be THIS particular DVD, but I'm not sure.",1017705600,,545,4.313725490196078
7919215,4,B00003OSSY,The ending is cool. The battle is finally over. They changed the dialogue between Bulma and Vegeta but it's still cool and so funny. It has a good ending with everything sorted except for Goku.,971827200,,193,4.542857142857143
7919216,5,B00003OSSY,"Frieza is almost out of energy Goku sees.  He explains how Frieza is no longer a challenge.  Frieza gets enraged and recalls the prior events leading up to that moment. As Goku flies away, Frieza is still convinced  that he can't be beaten.  In a a berserker state of mind, he fires his  final trump card at Goku.  ""You FOOL!""  Goku screams as he once  again shows that Frieza is no match for himself.  Goku frantically  searches for a way off of the planet, only to find none.  As Namek goes,  King Kai explains Goku was cought in the explosion.  With the  Nameks(Namekians? the show is unclear. We don't call ourselves earths) on  Earth, the dragonballs once again become active, and a few friends are  wished back.  They attempt to bring Goku back to life, but wait! They  can't! Porunga reveals something that they never would have guessed.  Once hearing the news, Vegeta hijacked a spaceship and flew into  outerspace, realizing that nothing awaited him on Earth.  The Nameks  are all set, and the final people are wished back to Earth.  Dende says his  final goodbyes to Gohan, and as the wish is being fulfilled, a tear rolls  down Dende's eyes, and hit the ground...where Dende used to be.",963014400,4,1197,4.6124401913875595
7919217,5,B00003OSSY,"These are my favorite 3 episodes of the series. In ""Mighty Blast of Rage"", Frieza is remembering the past battle with the Z Warriors, and becomes enraged with Goku for beating him. He uses the precious energy Goku gave him to shoot a HUGE blast at the Saiyjin (idiot!), forcing Goku to deliver the finishing blow. In ""Namek's Destruction, Goku's End?"", Goku is unable to get off Namek before the BANG!, and is swallowed up by the explosion. Then, in ""Goku's Alive!"", Bulma, Piccolo, Gohan and Dende use the Namekian Dragonballs to wish Krillin, Chaozu, Tien, and Yamcha back to life. They try to do the same to Goku, but they find out that he isn't dead (can't kill off the main character), and Vegeta leaves Earth to train in outer space and to find Goku. Unlike the past 28 volumes, this one winds up with a comforting sense of closure.",955238400,8,838,4.556291390728477
