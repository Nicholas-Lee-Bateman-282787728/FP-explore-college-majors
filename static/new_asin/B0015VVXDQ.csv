From Phil smoking a J on stage to the the first (my first atleast)  PigPen concert dvd, and to top it all off, clown masks during the only dvd version of Big Railroad Blues.  It simply doesn't get better than this, I must have watched it 20x the first two weeks I had it, I just couldn't turn it off, and it was great to call my brother up and rub it in his face that I had it, since he was the one to originally get me into the dead.",1219622400,,548,3.8230088495575223
