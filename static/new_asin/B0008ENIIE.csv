8055747,3,B0008ENIIE,"CONTENTS of GHOUL SCHOOL 4 Movie Pack:

FILTHY MCNASTY-- Debbie Rochon stars in this brief tale of two boring gals who are turned into sex kittens by a ghost's spell. Director Chris Seaver appears, along with several unusual screen names.

GHOUL SCHOOL-- Bizarre comedy/horror film. A mysterious chemical released into a school's water supply turns any and all who contact it into zombies. Hilarity includes a segment with nostalgia TV show host Joe Franklin and Jackie ""the Joke Man"" Martling.

MULVA: ZOMBIE ASS KICKER!-- Zombies walk the Earth on Halloween night and Mulva and her friends battle them for the Trick or Treat candy they crave. Characters in this hour-length epic include Gag Reflex, the C*ck God and Mr. Bonejack (who's played by director Chris Seaver).

SHOCK CINEMA-- Scream Queen Brinke Stevens interviews almost two dozen fright film directors and producers in this first of four documentaries that probe the indie horror film industry. By far the highlight of this collection.
