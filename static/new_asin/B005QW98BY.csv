4860692,5,B005QW98BY,"Even tho I already live in Alaska, I bought this Blu-ray anyway because I also bought the ""Sunrise Seaside"" one and liked that one, and plus this was only ten dollars. I put it on last night while I was paying bills and cooking up enchiladas. It's a real nice way to relax in the evening! The one with the bears, oh wow, that one was funny! The bears are so goofy and fun to watch. There's bears just lazing around and there's bears playing in the water, oh man its just funny to watch them! One bear even catches a halibut! Yeah, I would buy this if this was the ONLY thing on this disc, because the bears couldn't be cuter.

I would recommend purchasing if you love Alaska or would like to visit someday or have visited and would just like to chill out to some real fantastic scenery. Plus it's only ten bucks! The episode with the bears is my favorite. Well worth ten bucks! Captures Alaska in a nice way!",1328054400,7,908,4.218390804597701

4860697,5,B005QW98BY,"This set contains episodes from the TV show Sunrise Earth, which used to air mornings on Discovery HD Theater (now the Velocity channel), perfect to watch with a cup of coffee. These are not ""picture window"" videos. These episodes are designed to show you a specific place as the sun rises as if you are actually there, no narration, no music. Just the sounds of life as you would hear it if you were standing there. These episodes featuring Alaska are stunning!
I also noticed that a new Sunrise Earth set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunrise-Earth-National-Parks-Blu-ray/dp/B00CS7PHPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunrise Earth: National Parks [Blu-ray</a>] is coming out. I hope Gaia will release other sets, especially Sunrise Earth International episodes shot in Asia. The episodes ""Li River Cormorants"", ""Japanese Garden"", ""Ping An Rice Paddies"", and ""Elephant Trunk Park"" have never been released and they were some of my favorites. Thanks Compass Light, Gaia and Discovery for these great programs!",1375747200,,1050,5.9144736842105265

I have seen more spectacular sunrise colors. I would still recommend it to others",1361923200,,185,4.166666666666667
4860701,4,B005QW98BY,"I was actually expecting this film to show some scenes featuring polar bears, ice glaciers, whales, and the Northern Lights, but it didn't. It mostly focused on the brown bear and volcanic shots, and for that I am not giving it 5 stars. Still worth watching, if you are into this sort of stuff.",1359417600,,294,4.462962962962963
4860702,5,B005QW98BY,"Unlike some of the other Sunrise Earth Blu-ray releases, this one is entirely in 1080p. The scenery and soundscapes aren't as calming as some of the other episodes, but they're still quite nice to have on in the background when you're working real early in the morning or real late at night.",1342051200,4,291,4.615384615384615

8483913,2,B005QW98BY,"The video begins in a pleasant meadow, a few bears stroll into view.  A bear mounts & humps another bear with the grace & majesty of a fat drunk frat boy.  A few minutes later you're treated to an extended spectacle of a manically suckling bear cub, to include a wonderful shot of a saliva & milk encrusted nipple.  In high definition video.

It's all downhill from there.

After lingering upon such pleasantries, the video adopts an almost MTV style quick-cut editing style.  A huge chunk of ice sloughs off a glacier, falls into a lake, a wave just begins slowly swelling towards the camera then !CUT! you're looking at mountain peak.  Even a 1/4 second video dissolve would ease such jarring transitions.

The entire video is comprised of such jarring instantaneous cuts from scene to scene.  Almost equally jarring, at the end of each video chapter, credits roll, where an Atlanta video production company named CineFilm actually takes credit for this video editing atrocity.  (Google streetview CineFilm's lovely facility enjoyed by its talented employees.)

I've never been to Alaska, but apparently the whole state sounds the same.  A dewy meadow, a lake shore, a mountain valley, all sound like a clutch of whirring air conditioners, distant interstate traffic, punctuated by a murder of crows cawing obnoxiously.

The entire audio track sounds like it was recorded by an iPhone from a Texas Motel 6 parking lot.

As the video cuts from meadow to lake shore to mountain valley, the same audio track drones on without interruption, completely destroying any sense of atmosphere.

A settings menu allows you to select from stereo and 5.1 channel audio.  No sound emanates from surround speakers.  Audio sound stage depth is so thin I'd be surprised if there was more than one audio channel.

The video frequently cuts to distant mountain peaks obscured by a mile of atmospheric distortions.  Blu-Ray high definition video is an ideal format for such muddy camera work.  Apparently Homer has no knowledge of lens selection for landscape photography. Or is too lazy to properly frame a landscape shot.  Or both.  But Homer has a telescopic lens, and by gosh he's going to use it.

Homer also has a motorized pan head which is employed with equal artistic, if not mechanical flair.

It's great the cost of audio/video equipment & production has fallen drastically, allowing many creative people to enter the field and achieve fantastic professional results.  The downside of this lower barrier-to-entry is hacktastic guano like this video.

A caption periodically appears to describe the current scene.  When ""Both male and female red-necked grebes help operations on the seaplane base is 63"" begins to make sense to you, it's time to put down the remote and step away from the big screen TV.

Another caption obligatorily and ominously warns that glaciers have been melting since the mid 1990's.  (!!)

So relax & enjoy a brief video respite from urban life as you ponder your privileged contribution to the apocalypse of global cooling, er, warming, er, climate change.",1410480000,10,3074,5.005917159763314
8483914,5,B005QW98BY,"For those who wish to mediate or simply have the natural winter sounds, this blu ray DVD is for you!  It is one of the Sunrise Earth episodes, and has nature sounds, nothing else.  And that's why I love it.  No narrative, just some words on the screen that do not interrupt the ambiance of the sounds of nature.
If you like the natural sounds, you can't go wrong with this disc.",1406592000,,378,4.222222222222222
