8653789,2,B000007PMR,Pretty non exciting video.  Spends the first half showing you a glacier and letting the first guide give a 5 minute sales pitch on his particular lodge. Duck hunts for a few minutes and misses.  If you want to see someone stand on a bank and catch salmon with a spinning rod and reel this might be for you.  No flyfishing here.  I didn't think much of them kicking the fish back into the river. Interesting release proceedure.  The video didn't make me want to go..it made me wish they hadn't gone.,970444800,3,498,4.369565217391305
