The bonus DVD shows them on tour in South America, Mexico, and Central America. The audiences in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil are absolutely fanatical. Tarja Turunen (formerly of Nightwish) gives a brief interview from her new home in Buenos Ares, so she may have had something to do with them getting this tour booked up for them.",1452038400,,404,4.690140845070423
8475391,5,B005J4TLPM,"Awesome show, i do agree that the guitar could've been a little higher in the mix but still... worth having for the few tracks from the ""open air"" show alone!",1428883200,,158,4.3

8475394,5,B005J4TLPM,"Yes, the other reviews of this cd/dvd/blu ray are correct...it could definitely have been mixed a bit better. But none of that even matters, because this performance is so absolutely astonishing that it would sound good recorded through a paper bag. Tony Kakko absolutely kills the vocals for each and every track with a precision that I don't think I've even heard on the studio records. The rest of the band is in fine form, and Elias's solos are perfect. I had hung out with Jani several times over the years and definitely miss him in this band, but Elias is also a force to be reckoning night-ed with :). Get it and enjoy it, it's the best live Sonata performance I have ever seen.",1398124800,,686,4.496
8475395,3,B005J4TLPM,"Im a Hardcore fan of Sonata Arctica, but after watching this DVD makes me watch the previus DVD ""For the Sake of Revenge""

Something I love in Live DVD are the interaction of the band and the public, and they skipped all that material. I watched this Tour live when they came to my country and when Tony spoke to the audience was pure GOLD, is one of the best experiences I had in a concert. But in this DVD you won't find that.

About the songs, I didn't liked the choice. But looking for something positive, I always wanted to hear ""The Misery"" and ""White Pearl, Black Oceans"" LIVE, and here sounds AWESOME",1330992000,3,608,4.324561403508772
