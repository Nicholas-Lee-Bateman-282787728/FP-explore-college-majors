The book has so many layers and levels, no wonder the previous viewer did not get to see Emerence's full history.  I gave it three stars to stay neutral.",1458864000,,251,4.1020408163265305
8534401,3,B0091PBN9M,"Intrigued with the idea that Mirren, after all her high-profile work and awards chose to act in a Hungarian movie instead of making millions for high paid cameos in some blockbuster SF, I almost forgot the director - Istvn Szab who years ago directed one of the best movies I have ever seen, famous ""Mephisto"" where Klaus Maria Brandauer sold his soul to Nazi party in order to prosper. Being Hungarian, Szab knows everything about the fight of ordinary man with a system and I expect something similar this time.

However, Szab glosses over some very obvious opportunities where danger of political involvement might potentially bring disaster - this time he is focused on  difference of how we see our acquaintances,friends and neighbors, in short, what do we actually know about people we see every day. In the centre of story is grumpy old maid (Helen Mirren) who serves as a house help for rich couple living in a comfortable house on the other side of the street - though is clear the couple lives without any financial problems and have much higher position in a society, Mirren's character slowly becomes master of the house and everything depends on her. Mirren is brilliant as she completely dominates everybody around even though she wears rags and aprons most of the time - if you compare her costumed ""queenly"" roles from not so long ago, you are aware her charisma is by far above such trivia, she simply has a great cinematic presence. The big part of the plot is how she - clearly uneducated working class woman who despises politics and religion (and her superstitions border on paganism) jealously  and fiercely guides her privacy and nobody is ever allowed to enter trough her ""door"" - her neighbors and employees can always count on her but no one is allowed in. Even local police is frightened by her.

Fascinating as it was,the movie than moves into maudlin territory - trough series of flashbacks and occasional outburst of temper, we learn about scars from Mirren's past and why she is the way she is.  At this point I couldn't help but to think about similar old lady neighbors from my own life who appeared harmless and slightly eccentric but in their solitude nurtured fear, suspicions and old-age dementia. And as the movie progressed, I couldn't for the life of me understand why would anybody bother with such cranky old turtle who only scares everybody around. Szab suggest that Mirren is intellectually superior to her employers but I was not buying it - her limited life experiences only made her bitter and suspicious about everybody's motives and she strictly refuses anybody's opinion or help. Yes,there were some fundamental questions posed here - old age, right for one's privacy and right to die if the person chose so - but Mirren's character is so close to old age dementia that towards the movie I lost any sympathy for her. If she refuses to open the darn door even to her neighbors who want to help her, well good riddance, she made up her choice. The very last scene is so pathetic that its simply embarrassing.

All the best about director, his cast (everybody is dubbed in english) and of course hats of to Mirren who was adventurous and brave enough to move into non-commercial but artistically satisfying direction. I lover this woman,but not necessary the characters she plays.",1364342400,13,3327,4.797556719022688
