4782359,5,B005LAJ1K4,"After airing its 10 episode run in the fall of 2011 ""Hung"" was unable to hold on to its audience mainly because HBO insisted on broadcasting the series when new first-run network shows aired instead of airing it in the summer. So, sadly season 3 is the final year of one of the greatest cable shows ever produced and its the end of the road for Ray, played superbly by hunk Thomas Jane. In December, 2011 HBO officially announced it had axed ""Hung"".

 The third year continued to grow in both story content and acting as Thomas Jane proved he could be sexy, soft, rough, intelligent and manly...all attributes of the perfect guy. Ray is simply a hot property and he continues making a living being an escort for women only (unfortunately). Things really take off as Lenore, once a friend of Rays, seeks revenge against him and his pimp for stealing a business idea she had by transforming a young, hunky waiter into the next big stud on the block who works with the asset God gave him.

 I won't say if we do finally get to see Ray's huge ""tool"" this season, but it is unfortunate there are not going to be more seasons. Television doesn't get this good.

 There are a slew of bonuses on this two-disc set including deleted scenes,
the featurette ""Hung: Inside the Series"", ""Pimpin' Ain't Easy"", the Wellness centre Walkthrough, Damon and Darby's music video, ""Where Is Henry Ford?"", an Alternate Ending and 4 audio commentaries.

4783813,4,B005LAJ1K4,"My husband and I watched this series and were generally surprised with the ""more to it"" nature of the show.  Though a number of the plot lines were more highly dramatized than real life, the underlying principle of how humans relate through love and sex often was thought provoking. The only disappointment was how the series just stopped in the middle of things. Not sure how anything ""good"" could come out of the reality that the story has the characters engaging in but think there were life lessons that could have played out if it had ended in a more planned way.",1483315200,,568,4.568627450980392

Didn't think they were trying to make some sort of statement on society, the roles of male vs female.  It was just a different take on the pimp-prostitute relationship - and how two beginners could bungle so much.

Anyway, I picked up on the song, ""Where is Henry Ford?"" sung by the twins played by Sianoa Smit-McPhee and Charlie Saxton. I think it was episode 6 of season 3 but I'm not sure. I've been trying to find out more about it like who wrote it, the lyrics, was it written for the show, etc. It caught my interest because I never hear any songs by the younger generation (millennials) that express their feelings about the state of the world and their place in it. This may have been the first and it made me think back to people like Neal Young who expressed the feelings of my own generation. It didn't matter to me that it sounded like a song you might sing with your friends at casual gathering - someone picks up a guitar and starts singing.

There were also a few wacky story lines that just didn't make much sense, just daft and out there. Tanya needs to be executed for her stupidity. If it wasn't for her, I would have gladly watched 10 seasons of this, she drove me crazy just about every time she opened her mouth. I really hope there aren't actual people like her in the world. I can't tell you how angry she made me with her incessant wretching and complaining about everything. The rest of it was fun. Good characters, mostly. Great, interesting, and fresh story.

4788769,2,B005LAJ1K4,"I was really excited for this show, and it has some good elements to it: the strong, well-developed characters are the female characters, and they mostly move the action along throughout the seasons; Ray's hypermasculinity is portrayed as a bad thing instead of being celebrated (although this is simultaneously a negative element of the show, since we don't get the see Ray actually please his clients, going so far as to pressure them into continuing activities they rejected on multiple occasions); and the messages portrayed by Tanya's Wellness Center are empowering, sometimes. Lenore is 100% my favorite character, she's hilarious and powerful, I love her actress. Tanya's actress plays her character perfectly too.

But I think there are too many bad elements weighing down the show to say that I really enjoyed it. When I first read the synopsis of this show, I expected it to be very progressive. I expected the protagonist to be dynamic, and to receive portrayals of his sex scenes with his clients that were  genuinely sexy, sensual, and pleasing to the intended audience. But Ray is just an old, misogynist (and spoiler alert: transmisogynist) grump of a man who occasionally 'learns lessons' through his fuck-ups with women but never experiences any long term changes. He's manipulative, selfish, and entirely unappealing to listen to; I feel bad for all of his clients, having to deal with someone so unjustifiably into himself. All of the men in the show are unreliable, which I assume is an intended theme, but Ray's whole deal got real old real quick. Outside of a disappointing protagonist, the show falls short in its monotonous storyline. Ray gets a client, he and/or Tanya does something extremely inconsiderate, Lenore does something mean and unexpected, Ray gets jealous of Jason, every now and then Tanya creates problems for herself by talking to Charlie and kind of taking his advice...

and then the show ended without any real resolutions.",1455580800,,1967,5.08359133126935

4790177,3,B005LAJ1K4,"TALK ABOUT A GOOD SCRIPT, TALK ABOUT A 'PERFECT' CAST, TALK ABOUT GREAT PERFORMANCES, TALK ABOUT 'A SUPERIOR' POPULAR PROGRAM....THIS SERIES HAD IT ALL--INCLUDING THAT ""ADDICTIVE"" QUALITY, WHICH MEANS PEOPLE WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AND BOND WITH CERTAIN CHARACTERS: (IT'S LIKE AN ""ENERGY FIELD OF SPIRITUAL CONSUMMATION--LOVED IT!)...THERE IS SUCH A ''REAL RAW QUALITY ABOUT IT THAT CAN'T BE MISSED'' BUT TO TOSS ALL THAT OUT BY PUTTING SOME 'PORN' 'SOME PORNOGRAPHIC POP-UPS' IN IT, SOME RAUNCHY DISPICABLE NASTY PORN SCENES...WELL.  EACH TIME I'VE SEEN ONE OF THESE TYPES: ""THE PORN WORLD IS TRYING TO SNEAK INTO THE WORLD OF THE SO-CALLED RIGHTEOUS BELIEVERS IN GOD, JESUS AND THAT ENTIRE SPIRITUAL ""HEALTH REGIMENT"" (THE LARGEST MARKET IN OUR ECONOMY), THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO SAY...I WAS HOOKED FROM THE START: THE HUMOR IS LIGHT-HEARTED AND FRIENDLY and very attractive to bring the characters closer to the viewer as real people...as a real story, BUT THAT RAUNCH SERVED UP AS ORAL MOILINGS BROUGHT NAUSEA TO ME. (AND I'M NO PROOD: YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR ABODE, INCLUDING GO TO THE BATHROOM) BUT I  DON 'T WANT THAT IN MY MOVIES:  COMMON DECENCY BELONGS AND SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED  ON THE SILVER SCREEN AND TV AND IN LITERATURE.  SURE YOU CAN SELL A BOOK THAT IS PORNOGRAPHIC BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO LITERATURE WITHOUT CALLING IT ""PORNOGRAPHIC LITERATURE"".  I remind you of the fact that the children did not know...anything, until they started eaves-dropping on their parents.  (There was no emphasis on the health regiments to prevent diseases.)  BUT LET ME RUSH TO SAY THIS: THERE ARE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE NATURAL AND RAY AND JENNIFER (ex-wife) APPEARS TO BE GROWING THROUGH A STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT: because  Jennifer is trying to decide if she wants ""security"" [being married to a doctor], or, being married to Ray (who loves her??)-- we don't know this, not really--because in real human life he could be trying to get her back just to walk out on her like she walked out on him.  REVENGE!!  It happens--OR-- the two of them would grow-up and go back to the marriage and family to complete it with love and devotion....but can she forget and forgive all those women, all over their bodies--all over HIS body???  It would take a lot of work and a lot of maturity and  a very long time to heal all that... but it can be done.  *He would be stained and soiled to some women and some people.  Ray said over and over how important it was to him that he did a great ""f******) for all those women.  He took pride in his performance.  Is that a guy-thang?  Because most wives don't think that's the greatest part of their man, do they?
  I also noticed how I felt about a male-'ho.  In my day we called them 'service men""--whether society likes it or not a whole lot of sex is done by 'service men' because a committment of marriage is a million miles away from a ''boody call''; so Ray was a service man who got paid in spades.  But the traditional service men got paid oftentimes with a bit of love and devotion for their best life even though the sex was almost honorable BECAUSE he helped a ""lady"" in distress or a ""woman and her kids"" in distress: he fixed something; he lifted something; he built something.  He got sex and even some love and devotion for being there for her.  But to help Ray be a father that is present, the women paying cash for that...well, they are likely not to complain because they got the money to do it and they got the need for that passion.  I don't see that as ""raunch"" and ""pleasure"" but this movie certainly made raunch and pleasure the highlight and purpose.  And that's what's so very wrong with this outlay of human emotions and needs.

I would feel totally different if this was a story about a female 'ho.  WHY?  Because a female gives birth.  A certain amount of sanctity should be observed???  The female body is wired for lust too but gentle lust is highly advised, don't you think!!!  She will be somebody's mother, we hope.

I WILL LIKELY ""EDIT"" THIS REVIEW MORE THAN ONCE.

Jane (Ray) was just adorable.  Yeah, I saw his dimple and his pecks.  He was cute, right size physique. We liked this guy.  We really did.  And we sympathized with him. Women are not easy to satisfy. All the other character-performers were wonderfully suited  I REALLY (wanted to) like this product but I took off two stars for the unnecessary, explicit RAUNCH!---MO",1451174400,,4435,4.615581098339719

4790264,3,B005LAJ1K4,"Excellent elements to this series, enough to keep me watching, but ultimately it comes up flat and not just because the season ended abruptly. I love the idea of a ""regular guy"" who falls into this industry because he feels he has no other choice. I love the idea of an insecure lady trying to find her power as a pimp. Love the mentor pimp and rival pimp ideas. Even love the idea that the perfect couple in highschool have these less than average children. The problem is that the idea never gives you satisfaction.
  The primary lady pimp should have been played for high comedy. You should have been willing to sympathize with her instead of finding her journey uncomfortable and annoying. There should have been some pay off in watching her. It was good for her character to stumble, but with each stumble she should have found her ""pimp power"". For example, I think she should have figured out a way to tell Mike that he was an accidental ho, at first he was disgusted , but later came on board. The fact that she ran away and was too scared to talk to Mike, TWICE, was stupid. Her standing up to her mother should have given us a pay off, but it never did. She could have learned to be like the pimp version of the lady in ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" , but never did.
  They should not have gone so long with the story lines with the kids. There should have been more storylines, but with shorter payoffs. Instead of the ex-wife finding out, one of the kids should have found out and helped their dad. Or maybe they never find out and there are more lessons that he and the ex learn through having children that were different than they were in highschool.
  There is so much more that they could have done. Personally I kept watching because I was hoping that there would be a payoff but there never was.",1449100800,,1807,4.363095238095238

4790409,3,B005LAJ1K4,"I loved Season one and Season two but Season three didn't appeal to me as much as the other two seasons.  I liked all the actors but thought the material they had to work with as a bit thin and at times boring  and slow  and kept hoping for a change of pace or something new that was not pimp or sex related. .

I hate to say it about  a series that is pretty much based on  comedy and sex ..,,But there was just a little too much sex in play in Season three and I think the story line needed to be pumped up a bit and move on to some different scenarios.

Poor Tanya (Jane Adams) ...at some time her character (pimp)  should have evolved a bit more and she should have been allowed to become a bit less ditzy and dowdy.. but Lennie James did play a great Charlie  and Anne Heche held her own. Ray (Thomas Jane) though I like him, I think he needed better material to work with, at times he came off a bit distant and uninvolved.

 I still enjoyed it and watched the entire season but to me,  I don't think it  compares to the first two seasons.  Or maybe just that by Season three, the novelty of a plain jane woman pimp and a hunky hung male prostitute had worn  itself out a bit.",1448323200,,1182,3.9914529914529915

I think if they would have kept with the types of story lines that made the first 2 seasons great the show may not have been cancelled so soon.  It seems like the creativity was just lacking in the last season or maybe they just ran out of directions to go with the characters.  The Lenore story line was overdone and needed to come to a conclusion sooner in the season. She was just downright annoying by the last episode. Sadly the finale left you hanging (no pun intended). They could have at least made one more episode to bring some sort of closure to the show....  Overall it was entertaining and free on Amazon Prime, so I give it 4 stars.

These female actors who are just absolutely going to town with Ray in bed are very entertaining and funny.  They are just letting it all out, and must have been exhausted at the end of these scenes.

One key socially relevant issue they set up beautifully and then completely missed the mark on was a case of workplace sexual harassment; that was an utter failure on the part of the writers.

4795031,5,B005LAJ1K4,"""Hung: Season 3"" crosses new boundaries as male prostitute Ray Drecker (Thomas Jane) finds himself in a number of challenging client situations, yet the humanity of Ray often shines. Rival and younger male prostitute Jason (Stephen Amell), though, shows little respect to Ray and this is the cause of much drama during Season 3. Female pimp Tanya Skagle (Jane Adams) finds herself receiving the good and bad of mentor pimp Charlie's (Lennie James) advice and friendship, and his selfish antics prove a menace for her business interests and self-esteem. Season 3 contains a few notable shocks, and also some positive outcomes for a number of regular and recurring characters. Yet, for the television series to close at this point was a premature end to a show, which had at least one more good season in it.

4795032,3,B005LAJ1K4,"Hung was a very good show for the most part; a much more nuanced and well acted show that it's basic premise suggests. The performances are good, and the show was both touching and funny. It's evident that by season three the producers were trying to keep the show going in the face of low ratings, so the plot started to flail around quite a bit. Worst of all, the story is never wrapped up properly...you wind up having watched 30 episodes with the series ending as though it was coming back next year...which it didn't. Would have rated it 4 stares if it had ended properly, and 5 stars if it had ended well.",1392336000,10,611,4.321739130434783

4795145,5,B005LAJ1K4,"I've loved this show right from the beginning.  It's mature, fun and oh soooo sexy!  Thomas Jane is perfect casting for Ray Drecker; Vulnerable, sincere, even innocent in the hands of the women who dominate his world.  His expressions when giving pleasure to the women who hire him portrays someone who truly believes he has something to offer more then just his huge desirable cock.  After all who doesn't desire a big cock or envy it?  Ray gives his all in each encounter wanting to score the winning touch down.  Ray is a multidimensional character who you'd want to have as a friend and of course as a lover. His survival instincts open him up to discovering the far deeper meanings of life.  I believe sexuality and spirituality are both located at the core of our being which causes so much needless confusion and  conflict in life.  It's as if our society feeds on this dual aspect that Spirituality is ""good"" Sexuality ""Bad""! Particularly for woman and for gay men I might add.  Season 3 finds it's expression in the Wellness Center in healing this riff by bringing these two aspects of our humanness together....after all isn't it God we moan and shout out when ejaculating...oh God I'm coming!!!
Ray shows what he's made of when he goes with his transsexual client, Kyla, to her school reunion.  Kyla's true identity is discovered and a ripple of mockery and scorn pass through the crowd of alumni rejecting Kyla as a freak.  Ray, sitting at a table of ex-jocks, feels embarrassed for being Kyla's date, but then weighs the situation  and makes the decision to stand up, walk through that wide chasm of rejection and take Kyla into his arms for a slow dance cheek to cheek whispering in her ear that everything is going to be alright....this is who Ray is!  This is one of the most powerful moments in all the episodes so far.  Bravo Ray, bravo writers and creators of this series.  Hung has the balls to face societies arrogant prejudices taking a stand for all our human complexities, our pains and sorrows, and the courage it takes to show up in life and dance with the partner of our own choice.
I also have to mention the wonderful moment when Ray whips off his jock-strap and gives us a frontal view that confirms the authenticity of the shows title.  HUNG indeed!.  I would also submit that a large portion of Hung's audience are gay men so how about some bi-sexual challenges for Ray with regular men who happen to be homosexual. Also I want to say that Jason is a great addition to the show. I am looking forward to season 4 when it becomes available for purchase on ""Amazon on Demand""!",1359504000,,2605,4.577586206896552

4795193,4,B005LAJ1K4,"The mark of a successful sitcom (in my opinion) is this: you've established the characters. We know each of them well. Then they become more hilarious when they pretend to be something they are clearly not. In the case of Hung, in order for their hustle to work, Ray and Tanya must do something they weren't great at previously: be professional. The pimp and the ho try to get a bank loan in the first episode to open what they call a ""wellness center for women"". The first class is free and it consists of Tanya pitching a lifestyle in which sex is part of your every day existence. Ray wanders into the frame towards the end of the class for the audience of women to see him after Tanya has already talked her students into feeling more aroused. But of course Lenore won't go away. Arguably the person with the best zingers in the writing, Rebecca Creskoff has the perfect comedic timing on her delivery of Tanya's nickname: ""T-Brain"".

Fans that thought the male prostitute profession plot had limited range are wrong. Lenore finds a much younger man who perfectly compliments what Ray is not. Ray wants to embrace his job much more than previously and sees the new ho as a threat. Ann Arbor fans may appreciate the address of the artsy wellness center as 734 (area code). Ray gets more projects that involve role playing. Ray seems to almost border sex addiction. Tanya seems more desperate than Walter White (Breaking Bad). I think the writing is strong enough to give the characters much more humanity than say Californication. The nudity in Hung seems much less gratuitous.

The extras (you know I gotta have my extras) are OK. I highly recommend the Alternate Ending of Episode 10. The abrupt ending to the franchise is a little easier to take if you check it out. Charles the pimp says that there are only 3 certain things in life: ""Death, taxes and horny sonza bitches.""",1354665600,,1880,4.608955223880597

4795199,4,B005LAJ1K4,"The economy is bad and Ray Drecker (Thomas Jane) has lost his teaching job. What better way to make some money but to put his exceptional ""asset"" to work. With his friend Tanya (Jane Adams) as his pimp, Ray gets to work. The premise seemed to be losing steam by Season 3. Drecker is in his early 40's and starting to look tired and weathered. How much longer can he stay in business. Enter the conniving Lenore (Rebecca Creskoff)and a new young ""escort"" and his odd-ball girlfriend and the conflict continues.
Ray and Tanya want to keep their business honest and simple. Tanya opens a Wellness Center for Women as a cover for Ray's services.
Now the story goes in all directions. We have competing males ""escorts"" and more conniving and back stabbing on all sides. Ray seems to really enjoy his work and is constanting getting emotionally involved with ""clients"". Jealousies arise and they can only lead to disaster.
Although the series is enjoyable, I was wondering what the point was. Aren't there moral implications with what Ray and Tanya are doing? Health considerations? I guess we need to overlook those questions and just follow the story. Amazingly as the season progesses, we see the show centers more around evolving personal relationships.  Ray's ex-wife (Anne Heche) is becoming more human and learning to live her own life without relying on the men in her life. Their twins have a lesser role this season. Tanya gets physically and financially involved with another pimp. Ray learns one client is not who she appears to be. In the end, this season is about the conflict between Lenore and Ray and Tanya. It can't end well as Lenore continues to scheme to be the Pimp Queen of Detroit.
It's hard to imagine so many women are willing to pay $600 on an ongoing basis for Ray's services. Detroit is ecomonically depressed but you can barely tell that by this show.
HBO canceled this series so we end Season 3 with cliff hangers and questions that will never be answered... just as my interest in the show was returning.
