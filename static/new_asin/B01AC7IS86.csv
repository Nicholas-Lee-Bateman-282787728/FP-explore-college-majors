8746997,4,B01AC7IS86,"Not sure who UM Sound is but this looks like an official U2 ""bootleg."" Just got this 2 cd set and am listening to it on a Bose Box. Small print on the back explains, ""This is audience recording, available only in this quality and never released before."" Not sure what that means. I can say that it is not recorded from the mixing board. You can hear some crowd talking/clapping over the general crowd noise. It is like sitting in the middle of the audience with a microphone up on a pole. It's a ""you are there"" type of recording. No editing but an accurate recording of a great show in Berlin, on September 29, 2015.

As you can see above, there is a good mix of songs here, including the rare Two Hearts Beat As One. I do like to hear how the band updates older songs and re-interprets the new ones from Songs of Innocence. (No new songs here from upcoming Songs of Experience album.)

I think U2 are the most important rock band out there today and always enjoy hearing what they are up to. I have at least one cd for each of their tours and I do enjoy this one even though the sound is not as good as an official U2 mix,,,but so far, I can't get one. Surly the band will release a DVD in time for Christmas this year.

I recommend this for all U2 fans. It's a hell of lot cheaper than tickets to a show. (I first saw them on the famous War Tour. Also Joshua Tree, Zooropa and PopMart. Don't know how they keep up the pace but good on them. Coldplay, Kanye and Pearl Jam don't do it for me.)",1457222400,13,1494,4.092150170648464
