8451559,5,B001EYV30W,This is a wonderful classroom tool.  A perfect introduction to the form. A wide range of filmmakers from up and coming to veterans of the genre.,1280275200,,144,4.538461538461538
8451560,2,B001EYV30W,"This documentary was a nice start for those just getting interested in documentary filmmaking, but each topic was so shallow that anyone who has read at least one book ( I recommend Barry Hampe) would feel this was not contributing much. That said it was still nice to watch and the insights by veteran doc producers was enjoyable. Not long enough or deep enough for the price I paid (29.95) but may be a good tool for those teaching intro to documentary film.",1275350400,5,460,4.554216867469879
