I believe Genesis have been the most powerful music composers and performers hosehold of the last 40 years. This documentary is just a glimpse of their carrers.

6602278,4,B00MUWUGV4,"This is a better than average pop-rock documentary. Time is spent reviewing the careers of the two versions of Genesis: the prog-rock band of the 1970s and the pop band that emerged in the 1980s. The original group made some great rock albums and included Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, and Anthony Phillips. I still enjoy most of the band's earlier records, but the last album I bought was Wind & Wuthering from 1977. Between 1972 and 1977 they made some great albums. Genesis became very popular in the 1980s and had a string of multi-platinum albums.  For older listeners like me who liked prog rock, Genesis became just another disposable pop act whose videos appeared regularly on MTV. A lot of their later music now sounds dated. The band should perhaps have changed its name when it switched to making three-minute pop songs.

The documentary included interviews with all the band members, including former lead singer Peter Gabriel, who left in 1975 and guitarist Steve Hackett who left in 1977.  Genesis did not sell a lot of records until 1978 when they had their first platinum record in the US. The documentary was rather schizophrenic, as it tried to accommodate both versions of the band. The remaining members tried to justify the artistic merit of the hits that made them rich. Banks-Rutherford-Collins claim to like their later music. Tony Banks declared that they enjoyed making hit records and it was more difficult than it appeared. Unfortunately, most of their original fans, people like me, have little interest in their later music. The band probably don't care as they more or less retired in the early 1990s.

There still seems to be tension between the band members. It is now obvious that Gabriel was engaged in a power struggle with Tony Banks. Banks appeared to be a control freak and seemed to have a chip on his shoulder. Phil Collins, the former superstar, takes a backseat in this film. One irritation with the film was that the experts asked to talk about the band's place in rock history were too young to remember them in their prog-rock prime. They were also clueless about the British rock scene in the 1970s. Overall, I enjoyed the documentary. The band members are articulate and they are interesting to listen to. I doubt I would have watched had the group started its career in 1978.",1452297600,,2324,4.8025

6602280,1,B00MUWUGV4,"It's pretty much all been said before, all I can do is reiterate.....there are much better bio's out there on this amazing band, this is not one of them. Of course if you loved the band you'll want to see this, just like I did. And you'll be disappointed like most of us. Perhaps the worst part is giving precious time to allowing Tony Banks to go on about how Daryl Struemer ""improved"" on Steve Hacketts guitar piece from Firth of Fifth, while pretty much ignoring Hackett, the man who CREATED it. Did Steve sleep with Tony's wife or something? Why does he seem to discount/dislike Hackett so much? Tony Banks has lightened up quite a bit in recent years, even has been caught smiling....but Jesus, lighten up on Steve a bit! Hackett complimented the keyboard sound, he didn't replace it or threaten it, this was a keyboard driven band...period. Many, like myself, feel that the magic left the band when Hackett left and Collins became an embarrassment of mainstream pop rubbish, but I will forever love what they were. As far as this missed opportunity to do a complete comprehensive bio? This is the rectum of bio's of this once brilliant band.",1447718400,7,1147,4.655172413793103
6602281,2,B00MUWUGV4,The treatment and coverage of Steve Hackett on this release is deplorable and shockingly insulting.

6602286,2,B00MUWUGV4,"It was nice to see the fab five together again, and meet a lot of behind-the-scenes people I only knew by name, but otherwise this is a horribly disappointing documentary.

- No Steve Hackett solo work (why!?)
- No Anthony Phillips solo work (although it's nice that he's there at all)
- No Ray Wilson Genesis (an unbelievable omission!)
- No Wind and Wuthering, one of their most beautiful albums
- Brief and incomplete overviews of everyone else's solo careers (only the hits matter)
- A constant focus on their popularity over their music. I get that they were one of the biggest bands of the 80s, but that's the least interesting thing about them.

Unlike a lot of people, I'm a huge fan of every aspect of Genesis - all their solo work, all their albums, even Ray Wilson. For a documentary that pretends to be a comprehensive overview of the band, there's just way too much missing material, and a bit too much of trying to open old wounds.",1441670400,,945,4.52046783625731

6602289,3,B00MUWUGV4,"I enjoyed the biography plain and simple.  I believe it was well produced but rather too short in my opinion.  I felt there should have been
much more.

The Banks, Gabriel, Rutherford interview material were good.  I along with many other reviewers believe more emphasis should have been given to Steve Hackett.  All of the others mentioned their solo careers and what they did in and between Genesis, but Hackett was not given the same air time here.  If anyone has truly followed Steve Hackett, he is the only artist from the original lineup keeping much of the earlier Genesis material alive.
I cringed at the part where he looked at the others during the interview and said something to the effect ""Sorry Guys, but I felt I could not get my ideas through to the rest of you"".  Banks did agree that it was a tight unit.

Also another great part of the documentary was the area of the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.  I didn't realize how much Banks disliked it.  This was probably what really gave Gabriel the indication that he could indeed be a solo artist.  If felt as if Gabriel and Banks entered into some area where they never fully recovered from, perhaps they uncovered how different they both were as artists.  I could not help but wonder what Genesis would have become if Gabriel would have stayed and labored on.  I think without question less Pop standards would have been present.  Banks wanted to go the Hits route and use mainstream radio at the time.

Another surprise was Phil Collins mentioning that ""Lamb Lies down"" had some of the best material that Genesis ever recorded.

Overall well done.",1438473600,7,1611,4.619718309859155
6602290,1,B00MUWUGV4,"I'll keep this review short and to the point. ""Sum of the Parts"" is an incredibly biased view of the band's history as many other reviewers rightfully pointed out. I watched about half the documentary before just cutting it off in disbelief. This could have been the documentary to end all documentaries, but, sadly, this didn't happen. The most glaring omission is Steve Hackett's contributions to the band and as an individual artist in his own right. There were no mentions of his solo career nor Anthony Phillips' (who was an important member of the band in the early days). Also, there was no mention of the seminal 1976 release from Genesis ""Wind & Wuthering"". What in the world? This happens to be Tony Banks' personal favorite Genesis album and for a documentary that is slanted towards him and Rutherford, this album doesn't get any mention whatsoever? Again, the disbelief continues to take over. I don't care about Genesis' 'pop' years, but their progressive rock period seems to always be constantly downplayed for the more commercial music and I never understood why this was the case.

To sum up, the ""Sum of the Parts,"" it's a complete waste of good film and the band's history has yet again been given poor treatment not just from the director who must be one of most oblivious people to ever direct anything but from some of the members of the band (*cough* Banks *cough*). I suppose there's a part of me that continues to hope for something of depth and value that will forever be a dream as long as Banks or Rutherford have anything to do with it.",1437523200,3,1566,4.673913043478261
6602291,4,B00MUWUGV4,Very good. Interesting and informative. Would have liked more live performances from other band members.,1437436800,,104,6.0

6602293,4,B00MUWUGV4,"When considering this video release, viewers need to realize this documentary was made for mainstream audience viewers, who may or may not have much familiarity with the group. Many of those folks may not even realize Tony Banks or Steve Hackett have had solo careers, and if not for a few high profile numbers, Mike Rutherford (via Mike and the Mechanics) either. This is not to say Hackett got treated fairly, but so much emphasis being placed on Peter's and especially Phil's solo careers given the mainstream audience focus of this documentary should not really be a surprise. And for all the complaining about how Hackett's solo career got slighted, I find it interesting there's not also complaining about how Ant Philips's career after Genesis was equally slighted. I guess since he didn't complain like Hackett about it, no one's noticing...

If you want a documentary that treats each band member more fairly (albeit not their solo careers as much), one should instead check out either: a) the individual album documentaries the band released with each album in the box sets from the late 2000s or else b) the Genesis Songbook documentary. If you want fantastic coverage up through the early 1990s only (although again, the solo coverage is mostly just on Peter and Phil), there's also the older Genesis: A History.

Given what the documentary is and who the intended audience is supposed to be, this is a very nice documentary. If what you want is a general overview of the highs of the group (and no lows--hence the leaving out of the Ray Wilson stuff I'd imagine*)--then this is the documentary for you. If you want more than this, see the others I mention above.

*About Ray Wilson... in 1997 after the Calling All Stations album came out, Genesis was selling 20 tickets for the tour that was to follow it in some cities in the US. It's easy to grumble about incompleteness regarding that line up in 2015, but even Ray has admitted since that maybe the 1997 version wasn't the best idea (on the Calling All Stations reissue documentary). It seems like everyone in that version has since expressed doubts about it, even Mike.",1436313600,2,2137,4.801630434782608
6602294,2,B00MUWUGV4,"Sum of the Parts, the new Genesis documentary, should be retitled ""Some of the Parts"". How this documentary missed some key moments in the band's history is appalling, especially the short coverage of Steve Hackett, one of the most underrated, and one of the most important, guitarists of the classic rock era.

The film starts with the renowned ""classic lineup"" of Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, and Mike Rutherford sitting in a room together for the first time since 1999. This part of the film is great in that the band dynamic is set and the roles pretty much in place: Peter and Tony the leaders, Phil the jokester, Mike the loyal one, and Steve the quiet one. The members joke with each other, reminisce, bring up old conflicts (Peter and Tony still seem at odds over The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway), and generally seem to pick up right where they left off. This was easily the best part of the documentary and honestly a whole documentary could have been made on this era alone and the members of it. However, we move on to Gabriel's departure as well as Hackett's. At this point, the focus turns to the Phil Collins era, where longer prog rock pieces were largely dropped for shorter pop songs. I lost interest at this point since I feel the band, while still capable of making good songs, were a shell of themselves minus two key members and the songs from the 80s heyday sound quite dated compared to their complex 70s catalog. Today, fans clamor for the 70s classic lineup, not the 80s trio, and most the fans from the 80s have moved on.

The documentary then focuses on individual careers. Peter gets good focus, so does Phil and Mike. Tony even does though his solo output is arguably the weakest of the classic lineup. Steve, unfortunately, gets shafted. Never mind the fact he was the first to release a solo album or the fact he is the only member to continue performing Genesis songs currently. The coverage on him is embarrassing. I particularly cringed when they showed the Firth of Fifth famous guitar solo and didn't show him performing it, but longtime touring member Daryl Streumer. I have nothing against him or his role in the band, but neither he nor Rutherford were in the same stratosphere in guitar ability to Hackett. The clip should have been Hackett performing it, it's a slap in the face it's not.

Until a more balanced documentary comes out covering all members equally, I recommend bypassing this one.",1435968000,2,2462,4.668202764976958

I like many have always been hoping for a Genesis reunion with Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett.  However, after watching this documentary, it is probably better off that such a reunion does not happen--it would probably fall apart after a few shows. Tony Banks would most likely insist that Steve Hackett perform behind a curtain.  And for Banks to even suggest that Duke is a better album than the Lamb is a big joke. The documentary is basically a promo for Tony Banks and the pop Genesis  music from 1980s and early '90 which is mostly crap including those stupid videos like ""I Can't Dance"".  Watching 100,000 singing along with Phil on Invisible Touch is not impressive which was obviously the intention. In fact, the Invisible Touch album is the only album I ever purchased which I gave away within a few weeks. Peter and Steve, stay away from any reunions.  The only early Genesis tunes which Tony Banks likes are the ones that he is the lead writer.  As the British say, pure rubbish. For this documentary to delve into the solo careers of Banks and Rutherford which were quite weak and not to mention Steve Hackett is nothing more than Chutzpah.",1434672000,6,1267,4.650224215246637

I mean come on, these guys are the God's of prog!  This brings me to my next point of disdain, the era of genesis that gets the most coverage is the mid eighties Genesis, uuuhg!  I cannot believe how they brushed over an album like Selling England By The Pound and and go into full length commentary on not only Phil's solo career, but there mediocre releases in the mid eighties and early nineties.

6602315,1,B00MUWUGV4,"I hope Genesis gets feedback from Amazon because I got some things to say bout this.  Sum Of The Parts is an accurate title and boy did you disappoint your fans.  This documentary blows!  Been a fan for most of my life, if it said Genesis on it, I bought it.  But this piece of garbage you call critically acclaimed is a bunch of BS!  I never thought in a million years that the band that I loved since I was 5 years old would make me feel like a sucker.  The reissue interviews from the remixes and the book chapter and verse are a more equally biased account on the history of this band.  My copy is going to back up to either Amazon or some other website that I can sell it to someone who's desperate enough to buy it from me.  Sure I'm not going to get all of my money back.  But unless they come out with a better version with more input from Steve, you will NEVER get another dime out of me ever again!

6602316,1,B00MUWUGV4,"Some missing parts!  Even more than Collins' voice it was Hacketts' guitar that helped Genesis stay afloat after the departure of Gabriel.  The fact that a much loved album from that period ""Wind And Wuthering"" was completely left out of this documentary is beyond explanation.  It even charted as well or better than some of the other albums that were featured on this documentary, reaching number 7 in the UK and 26 in the US, so that can't be the reason.  There seemed to be a concerted effort to diminish the contributions of Hackett in other parts of this documentary as well, including a snippet of Stuermer playing Firth Of Fifth on stage and in the studio while Banks talks dismissively of the guitar solo that Hackett made famous!  (listen to Stuermers' rendition on The Way We Walk,vol 2 for comparison)  By far the most disturbing aspect of this film is the glaring omission of any of the solo work of Hackett or Phillips but not the work of Banks and Rutherford!  I do enjoy the music of all the phases in the Genesis history, but this documentary pretends to be what it is not - a comprehensive look at all the parts that made up this unique band over the years.",1423440000,9,1175,4.514150943396227

6602320,2,B00MUWUGV4,"This video is a truncated and commercially obsessed view of the band with the discussion of the albums covered featuring a relentless graphic of each albums chart placement.  If we are to accept music is art and not product this documentary is incomplete.  The absence of coverage of the solo careers of Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett is a glaring omission, as their careers include some of the highest quality musical compositions ever to have come out of the world of Genesis.  The lack of coverage of Brand X, in which Phil Collins was involved, is also a fundamental flaw here for the same reason.  I consider myself a fan of all the periods of the band and tremendous fan of Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, and Anthony Phillips.  But the emphasis should be on the music and not its market appeal.  Genesis wrote great songs during both its cult following and commercial eras.  And the selling point of this being the first documentary featuring Gabriel, Hackett, Collins, Rutherford, and Tony Banks interviewed in the same room is irrelevant, as these segments are so heavily edited.  There is no new information presented in this documentary and I would recommend the interviews accompanying the reissued studio albums, as well as the book Chapter And Verse penned by the band instead and Mike Ruthford's book The Living Years for the complete Genesis story.  I would also recommend checking out the individual albums of Genesis and their respective solo works separately from the R-Kive album, which is a companion piece to this video.",1421452800,22,1544,4.93050193050193
6602321,2,B00MUWUGV4,"Loved the band in their heyday so gave it two stars but this documentary enraged me - to be called ""Sum of the Parts"" and then slight Steve Hackett at every turn (even zooming in to shift him out of the shot) and ignore one of the founder members and massive influence Ant Phillips - that was a joke (and not a funny one).
Steve Hackett has had many dozens of acclaimed and successful solo albums and is also the only one who is keeping the old Genesis music alive, touring with his own band.  Tony Banks (great as he was with Genesis) totally flops with his solo efforts and yet they are showcased here.

Clearly this has opened old wounds within the band and management, and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth if I am honest.  Last year I had the pleasure of going to Steve Hackett's band ""Genesis Revisited II"" and also Peter Gabriel's ""So, Back to Front"".  These two are the reason I loved Genesis and will remain so.

This documentary should be renamed ""Some of the Parts"" as it concentrated on the 3 man Genesis and is probably a vehicle for their management company to try and squeeze more cash from fans.  For completists only, personally I would avoid!",1421366400,46,1161,4.401869158878505

If you've read any of the books on the band, or have been a longtime follower, you'll most likely be disappointed by this documentary release. While it was nice to see (as most longtime fans would argue) the definitive lineup of the band reunite for this release, it's a far cry from getting you excited. Minor things that annoyed me ... (as I remember) no mention of Bill Bruford or Ray Wilson (personally I didn't care for the Calling all Station album, but they could have at least mentioned it), no mention of the Wind & Wuthering album (which is an incredibly strong album IMO), the misspelling of Daryl Stuermer name and last but not least the reediting of videos (i.e. band songs underneath a different song).

The band look horribly uncomfortable together as Gabriel and Hackett tell Banks what a bbossy beat he was, the ccontributors are dreadfully gushing and parts are glossed over completely  ( Wind &Wuthering missed out completely,  no mention of reunion gig for example ). Most of it uunsurprisingly is dedicated to the Collins years and simply stops at 1996. Dreadfully put together and poorly edited.

8674784,5,B00MUWUGV4,"Don't believe the negative reviews. They were done by ppl nitpicking over Hackett's coverage & who also hate the 80's era becuz they are partial to early Genesis & thought everything after that was rubbish.  Well I say rubbish to that snobbish attitude. I like the 70's era too but the 80's & 90's Genesis was just as relevant as the 70's one and was also the reason why they reached the stratospheric success that they did.  Besides, this show (almost the entire first half) did cover the early days & I learned alot about the band I never knew.  Also, everyone who was ever in the band (minus Ray Wilson) was interviewed including their manager & producer - Hugh Padgham.  They even got Gabriel to sit down with Phil, Mike & Tony and Hackett to tell stories about the various albums & their beginnings which was very cool.  Add to that some old film clips, concert footage & comments by music critics and you have a great documentary.

So don't let the naysayers scare you away from this excellent documentary.  It is informative, entertaining & well worth an hour of your time if you're a big fan of this group.",1489104000,3,1114,4.512437810945274

For example, they finally get the classic 5 members in one room and barely spend any time on them. the editing was so piss-poor that rather than Steve playing his own classic solo on ""Firth of Fifth"", they for some reason chose Daryl to play it.  Whoever put this mess together obviously knew nothing about the band, what the fans wanted and what the band members themselves wanted. Little new information was gained and outside of some rare footage, it's just a tragic waste of opportunity. Quite frankly, with the budget and access that the producer(s) had, I could have done it better. And with certainly more care.",1475107200,7,762,4.7293233082706765
