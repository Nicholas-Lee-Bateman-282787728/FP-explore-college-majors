4235386,1,B003ZTNT2Y,"Turned it off after 5 minutes. That's all the time I needed with this turd to know it stinks.  The acting is so bad it hurts, and the constant jazz horns in the background are just plain annoying.",1404345600,,196,4.157894736842105
4235387,4,B003ZTNT2Y,"A great jazz soundtrack supports this somewhat depressing story of a sweet, innocent, stunning young woman wrongfully accused and convicted of her mother's murder. Sentenced to hang for her mother's murder, the young woman finds herself amidst four dynamically different women who eventually become friends and the closest thing to family she has. An antagonistic prison guard, portrayed very well as I found myself wanting to punch her several times over, is the puppet of a warden who's rarely seen and never audibly speaks.
For the most part, this is a very tastefully made film with only a few moments of nudity and sensuality. A 20-Aughties conception of life, legal system, and prison in the 1950's that occasionally feels satirical, but the heart-heavy story sticks the landing. If you're looking for a 1970's Pam Grier-style women in prison film, where the prisoners wear slightly oversized T shirts or tank tops and underwear as the inmate uniform and end up topless multiple times, this isn't one. With the ""love it, like it, okay, dislike, hate"" rating system it lands above ""okay"" and falls slightly short of ""like it."" Like another reviewer said, I hope to see more Starina Johnson films.",1403222400,7,1201,5.040201005025126
4235388,3,B003ZTNT2Y,"Likeable characters make this movie better than ok.  It falls somewhere between the tepid politically correct WIP movies and the sleazier, raunchier counter parts, all while attempting (and failing) to capture the feel of the WIP movies from the '50's.  The dialogue is so so.  The (clothed) lesbian mutual masturbation scene is provocative; but it's the charisma of the actresses that keep this movie from being a complete dud.  I really like the actress (Starina Johnson) who played the protaganist.  Hope to see her in other features in the future.",1353715200,6,551,5.0777777777777775

4235462,3,B003ZTNT2Y,"Stuck! Is the sort of film that Popotopolis makes a plea to try to save. It falls under the prison chick flick category of exploitation, B-movie feature. Jonathan Demme made his bones making such a film long before he garnered Oscar winning status for Silence of the Lambs. The opening credits and score are fantastic and come over with the urbane quality of a fifties crime noir. Impressive stuff and instantly engaging. It follows the fortunes of Daisy  a woman wrongly accused of the murder of her mother, following the testimony of her neighbour (played by Karen Black). Of course Daisy lands right in the slammer and has the usual lesbian inclined bitches as fellow inmates as well as the token hard as nails prison guard who makes her life a misery. It ticks all the right boxes in fulfilling genre expectations. The dialogue is sleazy and clipped and with the all necessary Amazonian requirements of the female characters. Karen Black is a revelation and looks not that much different to her heyday in films such as Five Easy Pieces. The fellow inmates are the usual: 2 tarts, a simpleton and a religious zealot that have firstly an antagonistic relationship with the new girl on the block, but then there is the rise of sexual tensions that inevitably come about from bitch slapping between women inmates. A joy. It also, to its credit sometimes feels like a British classic Yield to the Night starring Diana Dors.",1434672000,3,1422,4.780487804878049

Cliche to the max and impossible to take seriously. Possibly the lowest budget feature length film ever made. There's no indication the girl ever had an attorney, and a mere suggestion that she actually had a trial. I suppose it was all an attempt at some kind of character development. Main character isn't the worst actress ever, but she ends up looking more schizophrenic than developed.
Huge disparity between the volume of the filler music and the dialog. If you really hate yourself and choose to watch this anyway, keep your finger close to the volume button.

One movie takes most of the day, and then we get slammed with this crap after all said and done. Want women behind bars ""stuff"", then this won't be the ticket. Based on the other reviews I thought it might be something different and worth checking. Wrong. First I was surprised by black and white. And then to top it off, the production value is SO low, I realized I could shoot this film myself for about $2,000. Not an exaggeration, I'm a real producer. This looks like some type of student grad project from a film program somewhere. The acting is as bad as one would expect from such a project. How any of the ""good"" reviews saw more than I did is WAY beyond me. I can really get into an artistic piece, despite the budget, but this isn't one of those! It's just CHEAP all the way around. Worst of all, it's the second one in two days! I'm starting to think a lot of these high rankings I find for these vids must be done or seen while the reviewer is drunk, or they are being nice to members of the cast who are their friends.

4235497,1,B003ZTNT2Y,"I did not begin to take this seriously, and I started watching it with that thought in mind. This was definitely a low budget flick, and the plot, dialogue and attempt at 'noir' showed that. My opinion: not terrible, but definitely not worth the watch as it was a painful experience trying to sit through this. The image on the marquee poster (or DVD box or whatever) seems to show more provocative possibilities, but it is a bait-and-switch, and to me certainly was not worth the time to watch. In fact, I fast-forwarded it several times, watching what would appear to be interesting scenes which instead proved to be just as plodding and ridiculous.",1404777600,18,651,4.719298245614035

8410956,5,B003ZTNT2Y,"""Stuck!"" is not a movie for everyone,m and I can understand the low ratings of some viewers. However, it has a sensibility unlike any film I've ever seen. Is it ""campy?"" Yes, but. Is it parody of a style long to of fashion? Yes, but Is it serious? Yes, but again, with many disclaimers. The black and white filming is exceptionally vivid. The actresses are each wondrous, and for me create unforgettable characters. The darker aspects that surface later seem jarring (and may be), but serve to balance the themes. And--again for me--the ending is quite thought-provokoing.",1484006400,,572,4.907216494845361
