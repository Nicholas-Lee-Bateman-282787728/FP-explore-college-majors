8509501,4,B0073WQBC4,"I was surprised to find this DVD, as I know that, as of this writing, there have been no studio-sanctioned official releases of the Our Gang silent shorts (not including the 3 shorts included as a bonus feature in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Rascals-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B001CDFY5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Rascals: The Complete Collection</a>).  And I suspected based on the amateurish cover design and lack of detailed information that this would be a DVD-R.  And it is, although the product information does not state this.  As is usually the case with such products, there are no extras and a bare-bones menu.  The titles of the shorts are not even listed on the case.

OK, so once you get past that. . .what exactly are you getting here?  Well, I'm happy to report that the quality of the films is actually quite good, for the most part.  And the shorts themselves are a revelation, especially for anyone whose knowlege of the ""Rascals"" is mostly limited to the adventures of Spanky, Alfalfa and Buckwheat.  In addition to being funny, even after some 90 years, what really struck me is how innovative some of them are.  Who else, except maybe Buster Keaton, was using multiple-exposures and slow-motion effects in 1920's short subjects?  ""Shootin' Injuns"" uses both of these to great effect, as well as sound effects, for a great comic ""spook house"" romp.  Fans of later sound shorts might note that the ideas for many of the popular 30's Little Rascals comedies were first developed in these early films (""Buried Treasure,"" for example is clearly a precursor to 1934's ""Mama Little Pirate."")

The sound quality is surprisingly good, although the choice of music might could have used a little more scrutiny.  It's odd to hear Dixieland jazz playing over certain sections.  But they're silent films, you can always turn down the volume if it bothers you.

The rarity of the material, plus the fact that they happen to be really good films, makes this worth owning for Our Gang fans. . .at least until someone comes up with official, restored versions.",1363824000,,2134,5.217008797653959
8509502,4,B0073WQBC4,"I took a chance and bought this disc because it contained one silent short I did not have -- ""Sunday Calm."" I wasn't disappointed. Here's some info for those of you who might want to know exactly WHAT is on this disc:

First off -- this is a DVD-R disc, and it does not state that in the description.  The shorts are not restored in any way, but there is no claim that they are. The case is bare bones -- no information about the shorts, just the titles. The disc contains a title menu. Audio is, surprisingly, 5.1-channel mono, with music soundtracks on each short. Now for the shorts:

""No Noise"" -- Running time 24:35. Has the original Pathe title and inter-title cards. The version TCM ran in January 2011 lasted just short of 15 minutes and was missing most of the inter-titles. While the TCM version was superior in picture quality, the one on this disc is acceptable, and it's nice to see a more complete version.

""The Sun Down Limited"" -- Running Time 19:58. This appears to be the same Exclusive Movie Studios home movie print available on many silent compilations (has the opening title card), although other prints I have on DVD clock in at at just over 25 minutes. I didn't do a side-by-side comparison to see if anything was cut in this print. Picture quality is pretty good.

""Buried Treasure"" -- Running time 19:14 -- has the original Pathe title cards and inter-title cards. Another version I have is from a TV print that runs around 15 minutes and has no inter-titles and is missing a few scenes that are included in this one. The TCM short broadcast in January 2011 ran about 13:45 and was missing the same scenes and inter-titles. This print, while not as good as the picture quality of the TCM version -- it's a bit blurry in spots -- is much more complete and makes much more ""sense"" with all the inter-titles in it and missing scenes. There are early scenes included with Johnny Downs reading ""Treasure Island"" on his father's yacht, and more scenes at the end where the gang encounters the movie crew on the island.

""Shootin' Injuns"" -- Running time 21:25 -- stars with a generic title card of ""The Old Spook House"" then changes to the original Pathe title card. The inter-titles have all been re-worked. This looks identical to the verson TCM ran in January 2011 that had about the same running time, although the TCM version had better contrast. Picture quality is good throughout.

""Sunday Calm"" -- Running time 25:17 -- has the original Pathe title cards. This short appears to be put together from prints from at least two sources. The first few inter-titles are generic screen shots, followed by mostly original Pathe inter-titles and then one or two generic ones at the end. Film quality varies, but it is overall acceptable and easy to watch.

Overall, I was very happy with this purchase. There is also a Volume 2 available on Amazon that makes me wonder if it would be worth a look, since this one contained a few surprises.",1362009600,24,2959,4.5803402646502835
8509503,5,B0073WQBC4,"If you only know ""The Little Rascals"" from television with Alfalfa, Spanky,Porky, Darla and Buckwheat, then you don't really know them. In fact, they began 90 years ago in 1922 in the silent era produced by Hal Roach. What is gathered here in this wonderful collection are five silent shorts from ""Our Gang"" the true name of this wonderful troupe. We get to see how inventive these kids were as they all did things that kids do, playing with each other and building their own vehicles, fire trucks, trains and taxi cabs all animal powered.
Hal Roach and director Robert McGowan bring up the original gang line up; Jackie Condon, Joe Cobb, Mickey Daniels, Ernie Morrison, Mark Kornman, Allen Hoskins, Jay R. Smith, Johnny Downs and Jackie Davis. The shorts are hilarious and of course the kids are adorable stealing our hearts as they did with audiences 90 years ago. Jackie Condon was the only member to appear in all 66 silent Pathe shorts and continued with it when MGM took over until the end of the silent era in 1928 and then sound came in in 1929. This collection is a real treasure trove of Our Gang Gold as the title suggests. And now, these classic films have been preserved for everyone to enjoy. For adult film fans like your truly and your children today will love the gang and their antics.",1350000000,4,1303,4.5965665236051505
8509504,5,B0073WQBC4,"In the beginning---1922---producer Hal Roach had the germ of an idea; create a series based on the (mis)adventures of kids--REAL kids--in a comedy format. Thus, ""Our Gang"" was born in the silent movie age. The original cast: Ernie ""Sunshine Sammy"" Morrison (the first black child actor to be under contract); freckle-faced all-American boy Mickey Daniels; Joe Cobb (the original ""fat kid""); original ""darling"" Mary Kornmann (long before Darla Hood); cute but rambunctious Jackie Condon (who looked as if his hair was combed with an egg beater); and little Farina (who would remain with the series for a decade). I'm assuming that many of these silent treasures are either lost forever or in the hands of private collectors. So here's five of these early films:
""NO NOISE""--Mickey winds up in the hospital with appendicitis. The gang offers their support, but get quarantined instead. They lead the staff on a wild merry chase to round them up. Highlights are Farina moving in slow motion after being chloroformed; Ernie panicking when a skeleton becomes attached to him (a somewhat tiresome gag); and the gang becoming electrified by a device.
""SUNDOWN LTD.""---The kids' fun with trains inspires them to create their own locomotive out of junked parts in the railyard. Highlights have Farina ducking safely under the passing train while his foot is stuck (it was reprised in the early talkie ""Railroadin'""); and some gags involving the ""mechanics"" of their makeshift train.
""BURIED TREASURE""---Enthralled with stories of buried treasure, the kids head off to a remote island (via one of their floating contraptions), in which they run afoul of ""savages"" (it's really actors filming on location) and are scared away. This one's really brimming with great sight gags, including the kids' floating meal interrupted with sea sickness (the reactions these kids give are quite funny).
""SHOOTIN' INJUNS"" (aka, The Old Spook House)---Interestingly, the gang's fascination with ""cowboys & indians"" soon gives way to a gag-filled story with them trapped inside what is an electrically-rigged ""haunted house"". In spite of the story switch, there's some ingenious effects as trap walls move, pictures come to life, skeletons ""multiply"", and staircases turn into slides.
""SUNDAY CALM""---Which is anything but, when the gang is involved! Everything that can go wrong during a picnic does go wrong. Bears, pigs, swimming holes, rainbursts, and crippled wagons put families through the wringer.
Although the series would really hit its zenith with the addition of sound later, these silents are quite enjoyable. As usual, the gang's ragtag ingenuity in creating makeshift trains, boats, and even camouflaged headquarters show the Roach Studios' comic brilliance & imagination. But like their sound counterparts, these kids are all endearing, talented youngsters.
Sorry, no bonus features; the DVD packaging is pretty no-frills stuff. But the content is well worth the look!",1347408000,12,2957,5.375
8509505,5,B0073WQBC4,"Because these shorts are from the silent age of Our Gang, they are less known than the talkies, but they are just as funny. Some of the characters did appear in some of the talkies, especially Farina. My favorite one in this collection is Shootin Injuns or The Old Spook House. The Old Spook House is a more approriate title as it has the gang trapped it what they think is a haunted house. Pure gold!",1328227200,,401,4.2894736842105265
