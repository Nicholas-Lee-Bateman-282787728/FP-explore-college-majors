8289850,5,B001CUB5E2,"My students are reading Gilman's ""The Yellow Wallpaper."" Many of them never heard the story of Andrea Yates. They really are quite riled up when they learn of it, and this is a great companion piece for the story.",1395360000,,213,4.487179487179487
8289851,5,B001CUB5E2,"""The Andrea Yates Story"" is very well done by Bill Curtis.  However, its horrible story of how postpartum psychosis ended the lives of five beautiful children is extremely difficult to watch.  (Andrea claimed she was convinced Satan was within her, and drowning the children would send them to Heaven instead of becoming condemned to Hell because of her.)  The value in watching this video is that it helps others to recognize the dangers and hopefully prevent repeats.

Andrea had become extremely withdrawn after the birth of her fourth child, attempted suicide twice, and was hospitalized for three weeks.  The family was isolated from most neighbors - even more than most because of home schooling.  Andrea would sometimes stop taking her medications - without telling the doctor.

Meanwhile, voices within her told Andrea that she was a failure as a mother; doctors pointed out that having another child would like bring a relapse.  However, ""trusting God,"" and believing ""each child is a blessing"" her husband paid Andrea's doctors' no mind.

A close friend warned Andrea's husband that Andrea was acting strange towards the children after the birth of their fifth child, and she degenerated quickly even further after the death of her father.  Hospitalized another 12 days; new doctor didn't contact Andrea's former physician, and she was released again in only ten days.  Three weeks later her medications were reduced, allowing Andrea to become somewhat more active, but with less interaction with her children.

Andrea's mother-in-law began coming over each day to help out - an hour after Andrea's husband left for work.  That was all it took for the tragedy to occur.",1224460800,2,1679,5.1286764705882355
