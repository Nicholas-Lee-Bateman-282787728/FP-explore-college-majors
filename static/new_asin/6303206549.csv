7840726,1,6303206549,"Ok first off this is a waste of money just for a single episode.  Second, This was one of the worst episodes of Power Rangers of all time. The only episode I can think of that was worse then this was Don't Blow That Dough which was an episode of Power Rangers Jungle Fury. The story for this episode is Lord Zedd decides to attack the North Pole and kidnap Santa. The rangers of course go up there and put a stop to his plans. Odd thing is, they didn't morph at all in this episode.  If your thinking of buying this, I reccomend you spend your money on something better then this.",1298937600,,580,4.123893805309734

7840728,5,6303206549,"This video shows an episode from the second season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  Lord Zedd, the evil monster that the rangers are fighting is able to create monsters from things on Earth.  Lord Zedd can transform anything into a monster, from inner tubes to trophies.  In this episode, Lord Zedd decides to make the gorilla costume of the Black Ranger into Primator, a gorilla-like monster who can disguise himself to look like anybody.(I'm assuming the disguising power comes from the fact that Primator was made from a disguise)  Since Primator can make himself look like anybody, how'll the rangers be able to find out who's their enemy and who's their friend?  You'll just have to watch the video and find out!",975628800,9,718,4.852459016393443
