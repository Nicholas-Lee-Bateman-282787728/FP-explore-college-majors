8228722,3,B000XLQH9O,"An informative compilation of RR scenes here and there around the globe, if you generally like RR scenery.  The films and videos were not HD quality.  The 3rd disc was a compilation of videos of model RR setups.",1394668800,,211,4.526315789473684
8228723,4,B000XLQH9O,"If you were a ""Tracks Ahead"" fan, then you'll love these DVD's.  I gave it only 4 stars because it is not as sharp as it should be for a blu-ray.",1360368000,3,145,3.6774193548387095
8228724,2,B000XLQH9O,"I bought this product thinking it would be all about scenic journeys by some well known railroads across the world. However me and my family members were disgusted to find that most of these videos are either interviews by some travelers, the pantry staff in the train and so on. A lot of commentary. 4  DVDs out of 5 are all about people talking about their experiences....and very little scenic videos..very boring indeed.
This is not for people who want to see greats trains passing through some beautiful scenic places.

The only good part is the 5th DVD which has covered Model railroad projects across the world. Only this one DVD out of 5 is interesting and informative for railroad modelers.

Overall i would rate this product as FAIR.

TV series, Tracks Ahead. So if you saw Tracks Ahead, you  might be seeing duplicate series",1253145600,7,124,4.391304347826087
