8165369,2,B000LZ56IK,"This movie is part of the Water's Journey series.  The first movie in this series is good, although with poorly written cheesy dialog. The subsequent movies in this series are soooooo repetitive. Just buy the first one: Water's Journey - Hidden Rivers of Florida, and skip the rest of the series.",1390867200,,296,4.803921568627451
