They both discover that the fate of the one that carries the guardian spirit is a sad one. Chagum also learns that his older brother has died, and becomes grief stricken. He wants to return home, but cannot if he wishes to live on. After learning all of this, Balsa and the others decide to go to a nearby village to learn if there are any legends about the guardian spirit.

This is another great volume of Moribito. The story gets way more complicated and emotional. The characters are gaining even more depth. As this series progresses, it becomes even more entertaining. I had no idea that it was going to be this good. I love the animation, voice acting, and soundtrack. They all fit the story very well. I think that this series has something that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend it.",1357862400,,914,4.607361963190184
