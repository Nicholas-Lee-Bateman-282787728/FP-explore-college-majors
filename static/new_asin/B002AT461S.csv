8360262,3,B002AT461S,"I have over 150 classical DVD/BRs that I watch on a 106"" screen and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the front speakers are about 9' 6"" apart and the surround speakers are on my sides. The room has sound treatments so I hear what's on the disc, not distorting reflections from the walls. My reviews concentrate on the surround audio, as you can pretty much judge the video and stereo for yourself on youtube and similar sites.

Picture is fine, start menu allows you to chose sound track and subtitle.
Sound is DTS-HD MA 7.1. Sound stage for the orchestra is very wide, surround to surround, but not as detailed as some others. You feel almost as being in the conductor's position. I happen to like that, although it is a bit beyond realistic.
Voices move with the actors, but stay between the front corner speakers. It is a stage microphone only recording and you can see 4 stage mics. The singers are often 8 feet away from the front stage and the voices will sound different than with a body microphone 10 inches away from the mouth. That might be one of the reasons why some reviewers are not too fond of the principal's voices.
Within it's recording technique, there is not much to fault, may be 6 microphones would have spread the voices out a little better. But they are clear, don't distort and are in good balance with the orchestra.
I have the Tosca recording with Cedolins, which is with body-mics and she has a fine voice there. I do not think she was in bad voice in the first act and her high notes were certainly solid. Being far away from a microphone just doesn't do favors to singers.
Is it an outstanding cast? No, but it is the only blu-ray.
My next point is nitpicking, but the recording of the applause is pitiful. When you are in a life performance, you have 4 people sitting within 2-3 feet of you and when they applaud you are in the middle of it. Here it sounds as if the next guy who applauds is 15 feet away from you. You want the applause from the sides and rear to give you the impression of sitting in row 1 and you certainly want it louder than this.

Comparing it to the Marta Domingo production from 1999 with Ainhoa Arteta as Magda leaves me a bit conflicted. First of, it's a DVD only and the format is 4:3. If you don't mind the bars on the side and a bit less clarity in the picture, then it is the better production as others have described.
The sound is DTS 5.1. Sound stage is not as wide, but it extents 2 feet or so beyond the front speakers. It is also a stage microphone only recording but it is also well done within it's recording technique and the voices move nicely across the stage. Orchestra and voices are in good balance. Applause is from the front. Overall, you feel like sitting in row 10 due to the narrower sound stage rather than in row 1.
As far as the principal voices are concerned, I favor the Domingo production, too. I can't imagine a better Magda and the other principals also have nicer sounding voices for my ears.
So take your pick: Sit in row 1 of a so-so production or in row 10 of an outstanding production with black bars on the side.",1374883200,,3118,4.328205128205128
