7820170,5,6302036283,Ultravox: The Collection~ Ultravox is a collection of music videos that I can not praise enough. Ultravox was and is one of the best bands ever and too think that I have just listened to them the last 2 years. Midge Ure is a genius and his vocal skills are some of the best in the business. It is such a shame that I was to young to have seen this amazing and astounding band live. But now I have the great chance to see this amazing rock bands videos and to see what I was missing for some many years. Highly recommended without a doubt.,1153526400,,538,4.084905660377358
