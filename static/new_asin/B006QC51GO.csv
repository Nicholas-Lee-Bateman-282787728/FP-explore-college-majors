I cant even put into words how happy we have been with these WCS videos from the Trautman's.  Each one is packed with moves and style tips and they are all really easy to follow.  Plus I can't help but mention the music on these DVDs, it is AWESOME music to dance the west coast to.  Nice job Shawn & thank for helping us become great west coast swing dancers.",1398643200,,446,4.091954022988506
8502967,5,B006QC51GO,"I haven't seen the first two videos in this WCS Moves and Patterns series but I can say that I found this one very helpful and enjoyable. I've been doing WCS for a few years and have learned lots of patterns but I still have much room for improvement. This video will take you beyond the basic sugar pushes, side passes and whips, so if you haven't mastered the basics this will be too advanced for you. I would rate this video squarely between beginner and intermediate. There is a nice variation on the sugar push that I had never seen. The ladies I dance with seem to like it. There are a variety of side to side switches which look very nice. I had seen them before but now I understand them much better. There is also a simple timing change which raises the coolness factor a bit. The Review section is very useful and there are a couple of nice bonus moves at the end. If you are an upper level novice like me you will be pleased with this video. Shawn is good about answering questions if you have them.",1325462400,2,1010,4.238341968911917
