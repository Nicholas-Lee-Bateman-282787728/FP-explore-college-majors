5615698,5,B00BG1JPNA,"I was one of the lucky ones to see this film at the Freak Show Film Festival in Orlando, Florida. loved it. Got to meet the Director and Cast who all did a great job on this film which rightfully won Best Florida Feature!! Cant wait for Erica's next feature Mister White!!",1362096000,2,272,4.25
5615699,5,B00BG1JPNA,"Loverboy- this film won awards for a reason. Without spoiling the film- I will have to say the reasons are the following-
1. this film is  REAL !!! It is something that can and does happen- and shows us a reality that IS out there.
2. this film also shows the reason why we need to empower ourselves- to know we can make right judgements- and take care of ourselves . It brings a warning to be careful- some people are NOT what the portray themselves to be!
3. the cast- they rocked- I cant remember everyone's name  who was in the film ,but I will say that Amber Watson did a helluva job in her role. She really put all her heart in to this film and (to me at least)- makes you relate and think of people we know who have been in this situation. I couldn't help but feel for her.
4. Erica Summers- the director- she did a smash up job presenting a very real issue to entertain yet teach us to be careful. A wonderful cautionary tale- that is still entertaining and I would say also not heavy horror- but horror- and a film that can empower- and wanr us all the while it gives us something to just watch!
I know some of this may sound redundant but it is only becasue that is how this film hit me.
Even if you only watch once- it is worth that one watch- as for me- it stuck with me- it stays in my brain- and I have only seen it 2 times- thats becasue as I said above it sticks with you ,becasue it is real issues-
maybe this review will get you to watch it- I hope so- you may differ in your opinion- and thats all peachy king- but just learn what the point of this film is- and applaud at least for Amber rocking the role- and Erica for her vision and tremendous effort in this film!",1362096000,2,1686,4.029850746268656
5615700,5,B00BG1JPNA,"The combination of elements kept my interest throughout the entire movie that ended with that infamous ""twist"" that Erica Summers is so adept with.  Looking forward to seeing her next movie!  GREAT JOB ERICA!  Keep it up :)",1362096000,4,223,4.815789473684211
5615701,2,B00BG1JPNA,Pretty bad movie. I almost turned it off after a few minutes but I found some aspects of it entertaining so I gave it a chance. The soundtrack is great! The acting and story though? Not so much.,1451433600,,194,4.131578947368421
5615702,1,B00BG1JPNA,I didn't even get halfway. It was pretty bad.,1447113600,,45,4.111111111111111

5615706,1,B00BG1JPNA,"Didn't even watch this movie. I watched the first 15 minutes and thought it was stupid, so I tired it off. Doesn't even get 1 star.",1443225600,,131,4.076923076923077
5615707,2,B00BG1JPNA,"I didn't like this movie very much, and I'm a big movie buff",1443139200,,60,3.6923076923076925
5615708,3,B00BG1JPNA,"Brandon, the character and the actor, was definitely intriguing, but the story and acting seemed a little disjointed to me.  I do agree that it is possible to be duped by people, so there is a message to be taken away from this movie.  The actors were amateur, but they have to start somewhere, right?  There are movies that stay with you and that you don't mind watching more than once (maybe several times) - this isn't one of them.",1443139200,2,434,4.4
5615709,1,B00BG1JPNA,There was something compelling about the two lead characters. Decent acting for two obvious amateurs. But overall the movie was terrible. Writing was not terrible but overall this will be time spent that you wish you had back.,1442188800,2,226,4.973684210526316
