8201539,1,B000RNLHIO,"Most certainly a bootleg!

Unfortunately, I placed my order for this one day before Randall Miyashiro posted his warning review.

And I can confirm it is a bootleg.

Since I don't think I should score it for ""how much value do you get for your money"", while we're waiting for Amazon to use [THAT WOULD BE TELLING] to destroy this item from orbit, here's the reasons you should buy the real version and not this one:

Bit budget (how much space was dedicated to each episode) is clearly inferior to a genuine release.  The visual quality is a bit better than an off the air fansub, but not hardly enough for a DVD.

The only chapter stops are at the beginning of each episode.

If you are a ""Death Before Dubbing!"" Japanese soundtrack and english subtitles type, be warned that the font they used is small, white, has little or no drop shadow, and is quite hard to read.  If you don't know the script by heart, you'll find it very frustrating, I'm sure.

We're also dealing with pirates here: just how good are the physical DVDs, how much quality control was used in their production?  One of my disks had a small circular ring shaped spot, easily removed with distilled water, but I can't see how that disc would have passed a normal QC process.  Since that one was a DVD5, maybe they skipped QC for all single layer discs :-(.

Ah!  On my cheaper DVD player, when the exciting action begins in the final episode, the player has a problem with it.  ***NO*** other DVD has ever had problems playing on this player.  I suspect it has a high number of read errors in that section, although it did play properly in my more expensive Pioneer DVD recorder.

Recommendation: pay the extra bucks (not *that* many) for legit used copies, or maybe Bandai will come out with a collection someday.  Anyway you look at it, this most excellent and every bit as good as a Tomino directed series deserves a lot better.",1189814400,6,1902,4.482558139534884
8201540,1,B000RNLHIO,"The official Bandai release has this series on 10 discs, not 6.  The official release is also region code 1.  This is not the official US or Japanese release and most likely is a bootleg.",1189641600,2,187,4.314285714285714
8201541,5,B000RNLHIO,Gundum seed is pretty good. Im an anima fan and Ive seen a couple episodes and they were pretty good. In this set it contains the entire gundum seed series. The plot is great and the large robot machines are cool. It has good artwork. If you are a fan of gundum then this is a must buy.,1185235200,3,286,3.9482758620689653
