She (Antara Mali) is a self-taught dancer who doesn't want to compromise her art yet become a choreographer. He asks her to help him with his dance. We then follow each of them on their path into the industry.
This movie was very low key and arty in its cinematography and even its dance. The dance isn't really Indian. It's more expressive modern dance but not the jazz-hiphop blend Bollywood usually does. Abhishek does a lot of moody reflecting into middle distance and she barely smiles and breaks int creative dance steps. Abhishek who is known as a self-confessed dance struggler, does well with what he has to do here and she expresses her dance well too. There are lots of long silences and yogic dance poses.
We found the movie disengaging but this was probably as it wasn't our style for many reasons even though it was very well executed and a real attempt at something different and creative. We prefer the more commercialized jazz type dance, and more emotional connection between leads- and a pace that moves a bit swifter. We do like Hollywood dance movies of other genres but not this slower modern style.
So how you like this movie may depend on whether you are more like us or whether you like the more arty creative stuff and expressive modern dance - as it is done well here. It has been described as surreal and more realistic and a more subtle and intense love story (which we didn't see it as as we were feeling more disconnected. It is put down by those who don't like the usual Bollywood style (which we do).
Elsewhere on the Net it tends to score about average or a little above. For us we salute their creative attempt and craftsmanship but it won't be a keeper.",1243641600,,1842,4.501492537313433
8128852,5,B000G3ITM2,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I chose it because I like Abishek Bachan's work.  I decided to take a risk on one of his earlier movies.  I was not disappointed.  The movie is very modern and not very Bollywood.  With the exception of the songs, it is almost Hollywood.
  The movie opens with the title song, ""Naach"" which I think means dance.  The song sounds like something that would be played in a club.  All of the songs in the movie sound like club music. The young woman is dancing, except it's not traditional Indian dance, it's modern dance.  I'm not a fan of modern dance but I found this to be an intriguing difference from the norm.  In this movie Abishek plays a young man who aspires to be an actor.  He meets a young woman who dances modern dance.  She wants to dance in film but she wants to do it her way, not the way it is usually done, which she finds cheesy.  She is very intense and precise about her art.  Abishek's character wants to be rich and famous, whether the movie is quality or not.  He asks her to teach him to dance so he can keep a part he has gotten.  She agrees.  They become close and enter a relationship.  There are even some intimate scenes, though nothing graphic of course.  He succeeds first.  There is an argument that separates them.  It is interesting to see how they each handle that.
  The reason I said that this movie is almost Hollywood is because there is not a saree in sight throughout the entire movie.  It is set in a large city and it is entirely focused on both of them pursuing their careers.  The songs are high quality and are shot like music videos.  They are very elaborate and glamorous.  The acting was a pleasant surprise.  These two were entirely on their own, no family members and no friends.  There was not one instance of overacting.  I just really liked this movie.",1191628800,2,1835,4.340236686390533
