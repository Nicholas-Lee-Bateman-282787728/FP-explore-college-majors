8579261,5,6304474660,"This is truly an inspiring documentary that takes you from one situation to a next in a pastiche of history and adventure.  It's a chronology and brief overview of the achievements that were witnessed, documented and in some way included the National Geographic Society.

It's format is part documentary, part commercial, part news broadcast.  It's energized with the various explorations the adventurers and explorers that the National Geographic society had the privilege to employ and/or follow.  The music, the visuals, the entire dynamic of the piece makes you want to say ""yes, I want that life, I want to go there and be there with those men"".  Only one other documentary has ever inspired me as such, and that was ""For All Mankind"", a documentary regarding the Apollo astronaut's trip to the moon.

Regrettably at this time this film is only available on VHS, perhaps largely because this is one of the few NG films that's not owned by National Geographic itself.  Even so, if you get a chance to view this incredible film, then do so.  You won't regret it.

Truly inspiring, even if it is just a tableau of footage with music and E.G. Marshall's narration.  It's still a fine film.",1313452800,,1190,4.817733990147783
