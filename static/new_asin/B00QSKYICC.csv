8692643,3,B00QSKYICC,I didn't care for this story as much as the past books.  I will still buy the next book to come out.,1456358400,,100,3.5454545454545454
8692644,5,B00QSKYICC,I gave this to my boss for Christmas.  She's from ND.  She hasn't seen it yet but I am absolutely positive that she'll love it.  As for the hat - I have no idea what she did with it.  If she's not going to use it I want it back - it's sweet.,1452038400,,241,3.490566037735849
8692645,4,B00QSKYICC,"Great Series! It's a great series that reflects the drama, acting and plot twists of the movie. Highly recommended! It's a 5 star series, but pulling a star because of Amazon's insane pricing. $88 for this Blu-Ray is totally insane. It's available for under $30 in most places online and in store.",1450569600,,297,4.730769230769231
8692646,5,B00QSKYICC,"Great show, raw deal @ $87.50. Because it's Blu-Ray and comes with a Beanie? Maybe it cures cancer? Can't believe I received an email alert for this alleged ""deal"". This is something like $34.99 directly from Best Buy. Man Amazon has gone off the deep end.",1449792000,,256,4.586956521739131
8692647,5,B00QSKYICC,"Fantastic show, especially if you are a fan of the movie Fargo.  It has an intense story line and tons of wit.  On the same caliber with Breaking Bad.",1445904000,,150,4.137931034482759

8692649,5,B00QSKYICC,Great!!! I only payed $20 for the single blu Ray and got this one with the beanie! Thanks Amazon!,1425427200,,97,4.157894736842105
8692650,5,B00QSKYICC,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but my son got it for Christmas. When I put on the beanie - it was life-changing! I felt like I could do whatever I liked!!
And the TV series is top-notch!",1419465600,5,187,3.8205128205128207
