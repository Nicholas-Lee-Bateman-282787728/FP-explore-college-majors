8702047,4,B00TJFXGK8,"Steamy film noir with exciting plot twists, quality production, great acting, stylish storytelling, and a cool soundtrack. Inspired by the men's magazine of the same name - the series ran for two seasons (2011-2012) and a total of 26 episodes. In my opinion the first season had more well written episodes.

If you're a fan of shows like Tales from the Darkside, Tales from the Crypt, the Hitchhiker, Twilight Zone, and Outer Limits you might enjoy this series.

This DVD collection of the entire series has lots of extras, including audio commentary for EVERY episode, deleted scenes, alternate cuts, and lots more.",1526860800,,616,5.029411764705882
