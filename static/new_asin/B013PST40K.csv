Wish there was a trailer to watch before I bought it. Oh well.",1443916800,7,184,3.4878048780487805

8728450,1,B013PST40K,"Video was purchased through another source, so not sure if this will be added to the review. If I could give it less than one star, I would. This is definitely a work for those into artsy pieces. It is dark, depressing with cinematography that is jarring to both the eyes and the mind. The title of the video gave me no clue to the bloody gore of some shorts and the total nihilism exhibited. One must have a very twisted psyche to produce and/or enjoy such scenes. The titles of the shorts are not in any sense indicative of their contents. Many times LGBT are told they are dishonoring their bodies by the partners they are drawn to love. I find no love in these pieces.",1489276800,,672,4.299212598425197

8728458,4,B013PST40K,"Juanma Carrillo is a writer and director who has made a number of short films, normally with a gay element to them. Here we have a collection of eight that show the breadth and depth of his ouvre.

We have `Scaffolding' a sort of love story, with great music all from the Elefant record label and featuring `The School'. One about two men who meet just for sex, some arthouse dance and a disco scene. All of these are filmed beautifully.

We also have a satire on World War 2 called `1941' - this is stylistically very stunning. Two things seem to run through these films, one is minimal dialogue and the other is men with beards - which is a strange combination. The films range from stunning to charming - some are designed to shock, but I must have a tough skin as there was nothing here I thought pushed that particular envelope.

I did find some of them a bit meandering though and I know that makes me a Philistine, but watching a man walk around with a lantern for ages is not really a show stopper. That said some of the slow motion scenes at the night club were so visually arresting that you could watch again immediately. There is a lot of sex going on here which may float your boat, and it is fair to say most of these will make you think. Either way a very interesting selection that I feel generous in giving 4 stars to, but there is a lot here to see merit in - in Spanish with sub titles on the few occasions anyone actually speaks.",1447200000,7,1449,4.242753623188406
