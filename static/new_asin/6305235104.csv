 The current Leap Frog ""Letter Factory"" is a good tool to have too.  The only complaint I have with it is it's lack of repetition. It does all the letters A to Z without any review.  The Letter Fun tape, although shorter, does break it up a little with reviews.  My daughter was able to remember some of the letter sounds after only watching the tape once.  That's impressive!",1179273600,,650,4.286885245901639
7886165,3,6305235104,"The content and format of this video are excellent for introducing the alphabet and phonics to very young children.  It's short, to the point, and our 16 month old was captivated.  She already knows most of the sounds the letters make and was chiming in with the children on the video.
My only complaint is a big one!  All of the children in the video have extremely pronounced southern accents!  I've got nothing against the south.  In fact, I was born and raised there.  However, I think a teaching aid of this sort should feature children with a more generic dialect!",997660800,,570,4.594059405940594
