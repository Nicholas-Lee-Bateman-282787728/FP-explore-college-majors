8762364,4,B01G62TVFU,"Randy Wayne was excellent in his role, and moved the storyline along with wit and subtly. The storyline is interesting, and it was great to have a mostly family friendly historical movie to watch.",1520985600,2,196,4.794117647058823
8762365,2,B01G62TVFU,"With the exception of a select few cast members, the acting was so bad, as to warrant awards for the truly worst among them---academy awards are given to the top actors in major films and by extension if awards were given for the most egregious performances in this film many of it's actors would be in competition to receive theirs---I'm giving it two stars only for the apparent validity of it being a true occurrence---but the way these facts were displayed really deserved a no stars.",1504656000,,488,4.686046511627907

8762368,3,B01G62TVFU,"Anybody that has fired black powder weapons knows that captured soldiers that have been in battle during the civil war are going to be dirty. black powder cartridges ripped open with your teeth leaves black residue around the mouth and reloading leaves your hands black from the charcoal and salt peter in the gun powder. Men on both sides lived day and night in their one uniform. Marching down dusty roads, sleeping on the ground and cooking over campfires in the same clothes they are not going to look perfectly new and clean and the men will not be perfectly groomed after living in a prison camp. Even after traveling to the camp and days on the run the clothes are clean and new. Although the uniforms were correct, being so clean destroyed any believe-ability for me. The acting was okay for a low budget Indie film. Locations were authentic, camera work and sound good. It's far from being a great movie, but as an Independent low budget film with no known actors in the cast its better than a lot of Indie films I've seen. It's based on a true story, however I'd much rather saw how the main hero won the medal of honor later in the war.  It would have been fun to work on the film I'm sure.",1483920000,7,1201,4.40990990990991
8762369,1,B01G62TVFU,Basic story line had a lot of potential. I got lost in the long drawn out drama and bad acting. From a historical point of view this is not worth watching.,1482710400,,155,4.032258064516129
