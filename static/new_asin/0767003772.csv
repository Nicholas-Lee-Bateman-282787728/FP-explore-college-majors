7799630,5,0767003772,This series on the resorts of the world is excellent!  The stories of the innovative people behind the resort concepts and the construction are great.  The scenery and the resort interiors are beautiful and amazing. I hope that A&E Entertainment will seriously consider transferring the tapes to DVD so more people can enjoy them in a longer-lasting format. I have VHS tapes but would love to buy DVD's since the tapes are old.,1470528000,,427,4.835616438356165
