7846787,4,6303434061,"This is an outstanding video for both learning and watching.  As the previous review states, it teaches how to do an arabesque correctly, while also giving the viewer wonderful ballet moves performed by three women and one man to watch.  Ms. Schorer has an excellent teaching technique and is able to communicate effictively.  The only aspect of this video which I did not like was the part where one of the dancers continually adds her opinion as to how the other students do the move. I find this dancer to be a little pretentious, but that's just my opinion.",1036195200,2,561,4.646464646464646
7846788,5,6303434061,"This video is not a just a demonstration of the ""Balanchine Arabesque.""  It not only gives you the correct positions of each arabesque, but the theory, and thought process behind each of the four.  Ms. Schorer is a fine teacher, being able to demonstrate perfection with  students, and in return gives you ""heads-up"" on what to avoid  when practicing one of the oldest, and most important positions of  classical ballet.  This tape is a classic for the ballet perfectionist one  must become.",947635200,13,491,4.914634146341464
