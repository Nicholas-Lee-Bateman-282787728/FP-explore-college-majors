4641339,1,B005ARYD0G,"The runaway roadtrip episode was horrible. That ""rode song"" was just so awful that I felt like punching myself when I was listening to it. That episode is by far one of the worst episodes in the whole series. Hide and Then what Happens was not as bad, but it was no good at all. Shellback Shenanigans was OK, but it was certainly not great like the old episodes. Spongebob used to be one of my favorite shows but now it is probably one of the worst kids shows that is still running.",1324944000,3,482,4.193548387096774

8463555,2,B005ARYD0G,"The first two episodes on this DVD are obnoxious! My kids don't mind it mostly because it's new to them, but as an adult, it is just horrible! I think the worst thing to happen to Spongebob is when Stephen Hillenburg sold his rights to the cartoon. I was pretty disappointed with this DVD. I agree wholy with the first reviewer's opinion: the ""Road Song"" is the most annoying song in Spongebob's history - and there are some annoying ones. I would skip this DVD altogether and just download any episodes you might like instead.",1327104000,2,527,4.557894736842106
