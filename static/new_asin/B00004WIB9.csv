1364853,3,B00004WIB9,"I have watched this film twice now and I still don't understand it any better. At times it is quite funny other times extremely unsettling and hard to watch. What do you expect from star Robert De Niro and director Brian De Palma? Pretty much all of their films fall into that category: darkly humorous one moment deeply disturbing the next. This film is a sequel to the two's  earlier collaboration Greetings which I never saw. Maybe that film can shed some light on this one. De Niro stars as John Rubin. When we first meet him he is buying an extremely run down apartment with the intentions of filming his neighbors in the housing project across from him. He plans to turn his findings into ""erotic art"". He tries to sell the idea to a porn king who initially isn't having it but  fronts him the cash anyway. Automatically you have the makings of a De Palma homage to Rear Window. The people across the way include a revolutionary (the brilliant Gerrit Graham) and a lonely woman (Jennifer Salt) who Rubin starts to romance. Even that is not what it seems since we learn that Rubin doesn't actually love her he is just using her to star in one of his erotic art movies. What makes this film challenging is the second story, second film really, that De Palma tells which is entitled Be Black Baby. The Graham character is putting on a play that is aimed at white people to help them understand what it is really like to be black in America. He and a handful of African Americans ambush white people on the streets and get in their faces challenging them. The first scene starts off a bit uncomfortable but also  dangerously funny. Where it goes from there just gets  extremely uncomfortable and violent. I won't give it away because it must be viewed without knowing what is happening to get the full impact. It is very unsettling and feels extremely real and it lasts for a good long time. You want to fast forward or turn it off but yet you don't because you are fascinated and that right there is the power of De Palma. This film is full of his camera mastery but like in his other films Body Double or Dressed to Kill it becomes too much to handle and you want it to end but you are so eager to see what he will do next. De Niro is absolutely riveting in this film, only his third. You get the feeling that much of this film was improvised and he does so thrillingly. He is very funny at times but then he transitions where you don't know what he is capable of doing next. It is a great film to see how even this early in their careers, about the third or fourth film for both of them, they were already the masters they would become. Certainly not a straight up comedy like it is advertised it is  still a great underground film.",1233273600,,2737,4.337890625
1364854,1,B00004WIB9,"Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)

For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her  into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!

Stupidity not worthy of further commentary.",1138752000,5,620,5.18
1364855,3,B00004WIB9,"The second bizarre hippy satire from a young Brian DePalma (the first being Greetings), and featuring a remarkably spontaneous Robert DeNiro as a young Viet Nam vet new in the city and looking for work. The film (while noticeably dated), is practically an act of radicalism in itself as DeNiro boyishly tries to seduce his neighbors while simultaneously filming the act from his apartment to turn it into a work of explosive pornography. DePalma is clever here; he manages to transform the neighboring windows into fixed frames reminiscent of Hitchcock's Rear Window. Once a failure, DeNiro performs as a reactionary police officer in an all African American theater troupe's educational TV program, in which blacks offer liberal whites the opportunity to experience African Americanism as they beat and rape them in white-face; this sequence is particularly strange and not all together funny until DeNiro arrives as the cop. And finally, he transforms himself once again into a guerilla revolutionary, bombing Laundromats and disguising himself as a bourgeois salesman. This final section is probably the most enjoyable and improvised, though it contains none of the creativity of the first section. The film is interesting if for nothing else, because one gets to witness DePalma and DeNiro stylistically severed from their current work. However, the film seems to try to satirize everything in our society, when in fact it comes across as though it has satirized nothing.",1133568000,3,1475,5.280851063829787
1364856,4,B00004WIB9,"In essence this film is a sequel to DePalma's earlier film, ""Greetings"" with Robert DeNiro's character returning from that film.  The humor here is more macabre and at times it seems to be provocative for the sake of being provocative.  There are also moments of outright brilliance.  One is a sequence where a group of black radicals conduct a play where the audience, a group of white liberals, experience the feeling of being black in America.  DePalma utilizes some interesting editing and cinematography techniques, alternating film stock and lighting, going from color to black and white.  I would have to say that this is an interesting curio from a time in our country where there was great social upheaval.",1102636800,,715,4.974789915966387
1364857,5,B00004WIB9,"I've been looking for this movie forever , I saw it like 5 or 6 years ago on tv and I got completely hooked on it,It was really impresive, it may seem kind of arty nowadays but it has segments witch you'll see later in taxi driver, there is also a very unpleaseant scene which involves some kind of street theatre ..., I definetely recommend this movie to Brian de Palma aficionados and lovers of strong performances.",1095552000,4,417,4.428571428571429
1364858,5,B00004WIB9,"The most overlooked movie of the 1970's. Probably one of DePalma's best efforts. Also, a great example of DeNiro's early acting range. Funny, terrifying, brilliant. A great dissection of race issues, voyeurism, war, random violence, the family, and gender relations as well as a terrific homage to Hitchcock's Rear Window...",991353600,4,324,5.5
1364859,3,B00004WIB9,"Robert De Niro has played many odd ball characters in his day and perhaps none more so than Jon Rubin, in Brian De Palma's Hi,Mom!  The movie begins with De Niro renting a run down apartment in the city where he can begin his new career.  This career, he has decided, will be in the adult film industy.  He tries to convinces a smut producer to give him a budget to film his neighbors in the buiding across from him.  Eventually, he agrees so using a telephotolens De Niro begins recording their every move.  Unfortunatly his targets(who have no idea they are being watched) are not very interesting.  So De Niro begins to date a girl in the building he has noticed is lonely in an attempt to spice up his video.  However, this does not pan out and De Niro's porn career is over.  He turns his camera in for a television.  This leads him to take a role in a play called Be Black Baby playing a police officer.  It is being put on by some black radicals to illustrate to white people what it would be like to be black in contemperary America.  The play is shocking and probably the most interesting part of the film.  After the play is over De Niro returns to the girl from the building across from him and the movie ends in a melodramatic and bizarre fasion. This movie is definatly worth watching.  This film put Brian De Palma on the map, and De Niro shows flashes of the brilliance that in years to come would create so many classic characters.",972950400,13,1447,4.314814814814815

7925362,5,B00004WIB9,"Hi, Mom! is a black comedy film wherein Robert De Niro reprises his role of Jon Rubin in one of his earlier films,Greetings. Meanwhile,Brian De Palma is at helm in one of his first films.

Jon Rubin is a Vietnam War veteran who aspires to become a high class pornographer. He sets up his apartment across from the office of Joe Banner to impress the erotic filmmaker with his talent. Jon finds his efforts to film the amorous adventures hampered by a sequence of bad luck, and eventually takes a job as a actor portraying a policeman. Banner takes Jon under his wing to give the young photographer the benefit of his experience. They contend with production delays when urban guerillas and black militants launch their protest.

By today's standards,one would still appreciate this movie especially during the early years of porn. Also,we get to see institutions in the industry in De Niro and De Palma. Overall,it would still appreciated by viewers today due to the ""Peeping Tom"" theme in the film.",1423872000,,999,4.8023255813953485
7925363,1,B00004WIB9,"This film is from the era of my youth and I am a film buff, but I only recently even heard of it.  I appreciate films that test the limits and break new ground, but I find the high positive ratings for this film hard to believe - Is there some cult of people so enlightened that they can see value in garbage like this?  I didn't find it as irritating as some films I've made myself sit through, but it was right up there.  Everything about it was disappointing.  I get that it was supposed to be satire, but it was something else to me - bad parody, maybe.  I guess De Niro was trying to act as if he could not act - If so, he succeeded.  I think I can see what the film was trying to do, but it could certainly have done a much better job of trying to do it.  If ""getting it"", as some reviewers seem to have done, is necessary to appreciating it, I didn't get it.  It's hard to assess what it cost to make, but a film student today could make a better version of it for next to nothing.",1403136000,,988,3.905

7925365,5,B00004WIB9,"OK, so you know, there was a time that Brian De Palma made films that didn't resemble Hitchcock fare. Story-wise and style-wise. He was more of an avant-garde/guerrilla style filmmaker that made very daring, audacious films with very powerful statements (well, like his films still do to this day, but with more of that 'Hitchcock' flare). No, this leans more toward the Antonioni/Lelouch/Godard style of filmmaking. The 1960's were a great era for films! Especially the up-and-coming De Palma.

And, so people will know, it was De Palma that discovered Robert De Niro, NOT Martin Scorcese! De Palma cast a very young, unknown De Niro in three of his first films, ""The Wedding Party"", ""Greetings"", and this one (which is a sequel to ""Greetings"" in a way). Yeah, it was De Palma that discovered De Niro! This is a real gem too! Definitely a winner! Especially for fans of both talents involved. And especially for fans of independent films.

This also features Jennifer Salt (also in De Palma's ""The Wedding Party"", ""Greetings"", and ""Sisters""), Charles Durning (also in De Palma's ""Sisters"" and ""The Fury""), Rutanya Alda (also in De Palma's ""The Fury""), and Gerritt Graham (also in De Palma's ""Greetings"", ""Phantom of the Paradise"", and ""Home Movies"").

This is a very powerful, hard-hitting revolutionary film that deals with some very tough issues of the day that are still relevant today. Things like war, racism, obsession, paranoia, and equality among the Human race...And, yes, voyeurism! De Palma deals with voyeurism in the best possible sense than any other film director in the business. First, he makes us want to watch, then makes us almost afraid to turn away, but also afraid to keep watching, then he makes us feel disgusted for even wanting to watch. Yes, he so effectively exposes the deep sick desire that we as a people share in common: We love to be witnesses to any kind of event; spectators to the entertainment.

Whether it's television, film, and/or live events, we just can't help but watch. And, if asked to participate, well, that is just a crime! And, that, my friends, is the crime that De Palma commits so many times with his brilliant films! That is why he so effectively splits his audiences down the middle: He asks for participation from his audience...Don't just sit there like a nimbacile, actually try to 'solve' something, try to find the solution to the problem, try to, well, quit just letting your life pass you by as you just sit there as a witness to your own drama. Participate in Life!

For anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of seeing this film, be prepared to be shocked out of your seats by some very hard-hitting subjects, mainly that of racism in this country. The ""Be Black, Baby"" sequence is possibly one of the most daring, straight-forward approaches to dealing with this subject ever committed to film. Disturbing, hilarious, jolting, and very dramatic, this film turns itself inside out, exposing and exploring the art of filmmaking in and of itself. And, gives a whole new meaning to 'guerilla terrorism'!

Oh, this also pokes fun at the whole porn industry, something that Brian would continue to do many years later with his classic psychological erotic thriller ""Body Double"".

This film is fantastic would make a good double bill with ""Taxi Driver"", because in many ways it feels like a comic trial run for that movie. More so even than most of his later work, this movie and its predecessor ""Greetings"" put De Palma firmly among the influential first generation of film-school filmmakers like Scorsese and Coppola.

As for Scorcese and Coppolla, well, they and De Palma (and Spielberg & Lucas)) all started around the same time and are referred to as The Brat Pack. Never seen ""Taxi Driver' (I know, shame on me!), but I could believe that Marty 'borrowed' from this for his film (like he borrowed De Niro and took credit for discovering him when we all know it was Brian who discovered him).

To me, De Palma IS the most influential of The Brat Pack, for he is, was, and always will be the most prominent and most daring, and the one to never sell out to Hollywood standard bulls**t. Look at his catalog: When he does do a 'studio' film, it is still a `Brian De Palma film'. His touches are flourishing through every film he has ever made, whether he wrote them or not.

The obvious rough edges in ""Hi Mom!"" may be due to budgetary or creative constraints in a few cases, but I think they are more often intentional. It's as if in trying to catch lightning in a bottle with an almost ""guerrilla"" style of filming and acting, they had to concede that a strange edit here or a too-shaky camera there were unavoidable. I believe all the editing and 'shaky-film-look' was on purpose to create what is known as a ""guerilla"" style.

In the meantime, don't rent from slumlords, don't take a 'job' from someone you meet in a porn theater, don't fight in a senseless war, and, for God sakes, don't hate your neighbor just because their skin is a different color than yours! Then, maybe you can get on TV and say...""Hi, Mom!""....
Thank you! ;-)",1306972800,2,5096,4.7468926553672315
7925366,3,B00004WIB9,"Director Brian De Palma and contemporary Martin Scorsese appeared together on a 1978 TV interview (just around the time THE LAST WALTZ was in theatres) and they started talking about Robert De Niro. De Palma went on to say he was using De Niro before Scorsese succussfully tapped into the upcoming actor's talents with MEAN STREETS and TAXI DRIVER. In the late 1960's Brian De Palma made two small independent movies, GREETINGS and HI MOM! using the then unknown Robert D.
  De Niro's audition for De Palma was discussed amusingly. De Niro entered being very shy and introverted, but when he went into his role he came out loud, strong and robust. De Palma in his own words said he was like
Lee J. Cobb.

  PBS should uncover this 30 year plus old interview and make it available on DVD as a special feature, interview compilation, or anything to celebrate the MEN WHO MAKE MOVIES - Scorsese, De Palma and De Niro who have done so
much reshaping the movies of the 1970's through today (give or take a couple of years.) But it all started with
a movie minus a budget titled HI MOM!",1297468800,,1080,4.517948717948718
7925367,5,B00004WIB9,"Hi Mom! showcases the awesome talent of Robert De Niro when he was rather young in this film directed by Brian De Palma. In a way that I can't quite verbalize, the film somehow gains its strength from the very fact that there is a side dish of surrealism mixed in with the main plot; and that creativity is something I greatly admire. The acting is wonderful and they couldn't have cast the actors any better; everyone's acting is great. The cinematography works well and the choreography shines in crowd scenes as well as through the rest of the film. The action moves along at a very good pace and I was never once bored; this film became more and more interesting, pulling me in further and further as the film progressed.

When the film starts, we quickly meet young aspiring ""peep art"" film maker John Rubin (Robert De Niro). John moves into a very shabby apartment across from a New York City high-rise building to surreptitiously film the romantic escapades and other goings on of the people living across the lot using a zoom lens from his boss/partner, Joe Banner (Allen Garfield). Soon John is able to film practically everyone across the lot using his camera and new lens; and wow, how he gets footage! John also notices that a pretty young woman, Judy Bishop (Jennifer Salt), is quite single and available; and after an elaborate ruse he worms his way into her life.

Meanwhile, things don't go exactly as planned with John's film project--while he was trying to film him and Judy alone together with just the camera back in his apartment, the camera tilts too low and films someone else who Joe Banner isn't interested in, to say the least. Banner gets rid of John and John must do something else to make a few bucks. John joins an extremist acting troupe as he continues his romance with Judy; and that's when you should look for the extended and remarkably powerful scene of their ""show"" entitled Be Black, Baby. Talk about intense! De Niro is scarcely in this very long extended scene but he does his part well and the other actors give a performance you won't easily forget. Some people say that this is the point where the film goes too far away from the opening plot but I think it works well. It's surrealistic and strong.

Of course, from here the plot can go anywhere; and it certainly takes a few twists and turns that leave me thinking about this film. It tackles not just racial issues but also the war in Vietnam with other themes winding their way in and out of the movie; and it's all very impressive. In addition, look for Charles Durning to do a great cameo as a building superintendent; and Gerrit Graham does a wonderful job of playing Gerrit Wood, a film student who is also connected to the radical theater troupe.

The DVD comes with few extras; on one side you get the movie in widescreen format and the other side has it in fullscreen format. There's the theatrical trailer but that's about it; I would have loved some commentary but unfortunately it's not there.

Hi Mom! is a must-have for any fan of Robert De Niro or the other actors in this film. If you like artistic films with social commentary that actually means something and stimulates your brain, add this film to your collection.",1260489600,,3229,4.579584775086505

7925369,2,B00004WIB9,"I saw ""Hi, Mom!"" listed in a book entitled ""The New York Times Guide to the Best 1000 Movies ever Made"".  I have made it a point to watch those films whenever possible which is why I rented ""Hi, Mom!"" last night.  What a waste of time that was.  Robert de Niro is the ""star"" of this film and his preformance is a mixed bag.  I would rate it on par with his acting in ""Rocky and Bulwinkle"".

The movie starts out awkwardly as it seems to be an R-rated movie about the porn industry.  It veers away from that into something entirely different as it seems to want to shock the audience into empathy.  It stumbles to the end attempting to expand its' simplistic portrayal of American stereotypes.  Maybe this movie is supposed to be ""black humor""; that genre that shames you into thinking a lousy movie is actually a work of art (when the truth is that your first impression was the correct assessment).  In my opinion, the only impressive bit of acting in this movie was that of the porn distributor.

This film DID remind me of a 70's film called ""Kentucky Fried Movie"".  That movie veered off in different directions as well but it had the advantage of actually being funny.  I'm actually rather embarassed to admit that I watched ""Hi, Mom!"".  Lets just put this review in the category of a public service.
