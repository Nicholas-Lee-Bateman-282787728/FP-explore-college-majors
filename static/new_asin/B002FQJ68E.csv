$15.99 is pretty darn costly for such a short video.

Gothicfest is basically (1) full length SLICK IDIOT performance and (1) full length HANZEL UND GRETYL performance... with a few brief interviews and behind-the-scenes footage.

Since my name is plastered all over this release, I feel that I have the right to let my feelings known.

I believe the majority of this footage has been on YouTube (for free) since 2006.  So please do not blame me if you feel ""ripped-off"".",1249603200,2,573,4.69

It was a great festival and the bands all put on a great performance.  Like I said, I'm rather excited to see how this turns out.

Funny that they put Ray Wise and Gwen Bartolini as the stars, as they're both in the same band as I was, yet oddly they're suddenly the stars.  Too funny.

Anyways, check it out, give it some stars, and enjoy.",1249516800,,582,4.314814814814815
