Although the settings were simple, the filming was good.  In respect for the reviewer who did not like this movie, yes, there were a few wooden scenes and yes, some of the sub-plots were underdeveloped. Also, I must admit that unlike Hollywood movies, this film has no visual eye-candy and no big name actors.  However, most of the acting was good and the sub-plots succeeded in placing the main story within the many issues of that era.  On the other hand, given the movie's limited budget, the director might have done better by keeping the focus on girls within the orphanage and the struggle to keep the orphanage open.",1382140800,,836,4.751724137931035
8581107,1,B00CETXJR6,"That disposal was totally misguided.
What could have been a decent effort fell apart in the opening minutes.  Shallow characterizations caused and the wooden acting, spiced by tentative direction and bare bones production values took a weak story and made it a punishment to watch.
The era and subject matter could have been a masterpiece of bathos. Instead it felt like  the study notes in how not to make a film.
A disaster and painful to watch.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",1378857600,,469,4.777777777777778
