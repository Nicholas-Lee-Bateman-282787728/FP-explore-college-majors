2293240,5,B0009IW8LC,"This is an excellent movie for children, probably between the ages of 6 and 12.  It's a fun romp through Paris and kids and parents alike will be very entertained throughout the entire movie!  I strongly encourage everyone to buy this dvd for their kids!",1131926400,2,254,4.622222222222222
2293241,4,B0009IW8LC,"Lots of fun!  There aren't many movies out there for the whole family--this is one of the few.  It's a great romp through the streets (and metro) of Paris with leads you'll be rooting for and bad guys who are more mysterious than evil.  Jon Cryer is great as the third grade teacher who asks, ""What did you do this summer?""",1126828800,2,323,4.262295081967213
2293242,5,B0009IW8LC,I am ordering this because Olympic Champion Tara Lipinski has a major role in this Indy Film. Metro Chase and have waited 5 Years for it to be released. I can't wait to see it she said the cast and crew were Great to work with on this Project.,1115251200,4,243,3.979591836734694
8061428,5,B0009IW8LC,"This is a great film for kids. It's fun and engaging for them and at the same time, they are learning so much about Paris, Parisians and the French language.  Spot on authenticity. Don't be surprised if, after watching this film, your kids want to go to Paris.",1372291200,,260,4.416666666666667
8061429,5,B0009IW8LC,"Thanks for the very good DVD.  The first time I bought one on-line it turned ot to be the wrong type to play on my DVD player.  This is a DVD
that I really wanted and it is just as good as I had hoped for.
Thanks for the great service and correct quality type product.",1243296000,,268,3.767857142857143
8061430,5,B0009IW8LC,"This is a fun movie to watch with kids. It is about an American boy who is lost in Paris, witnesses a crime and ends up being chased by the bad guys. I got quite a kick out of listening to my nephews discuss how they would have handled the situation. You get a first hand look at the city of Paris and kids can really get a feel for what is like to be there. There are some subtitles, so young children who cannot read may not understand one scene, but they should get the gist of it. It's a very entertaining movie.",1136851200,3,516,3.9711538461538463
8061431,5,B0009IW8LC,"If you love Paris in the springtime, as I do, and can't afford a vacation there this year, just pop in this enchanting DVD and let it take you there. Incredibly authentic accents, serene music, beautiful scenery!!! Every sight you can imagine. No kidding-Eiffel Tower, the streets of Montmartre and the Buttes de Montmartre, the Metro (trains and stations), the Marais (watch for St. Paul's), the Gare du Nord, and much more. Oh, and enjoy a sweet little movie at the same time. Almost as good as being there.",1136419200,2,509,4.730337078651686
8061432,5,B0009IW8LC,"This is a surprisingly good little movie. The plot is not too much of a stretch and there are a variety of interesting characters. The acting is decent. All in all, it's pretty well done for a television movie. If you have ever been to Paris, this film will show you sights you have seen and then some. It's a good film for kids and adults alike.",1136160000,3,346,4.17910447761194
8061433,5,B0009IW8LC,"This was a cute family movie. It stars Tara Lipinski, Lindsay Felton, Jon Cryer and a young newcomer named Christopher Plumley. There is also a French actor named Olivier Galfione and a couple of funny teen-age boys named John Hooper and Jason Padgett. The movie is about the boy's homework assignment to tell the class about what he did on his summer vacation and his retelling of his adventure in Paris. He gets lost and becomes involved with some small-time crooks, eventually helping the police catch them. For a children's television movie, I must says they had some pretty spectacular locations. The story and performances are decent. The soundtrack is excellent. It is worth watching for sure.",1134691200,3,700,4.9914529914529915
8061434,5,B0009IW8LC,"A children's movie about a boy and his sister on vacation in Paris and their adventures there. It's a very warm little tale with a variety of characters-lots of quirky French folk. It has its exciting moments, too. Shows more of Paris than I have EVER seen in a movie. Great acting by newcomer Christopher Plumley. Nice to see lovely Lindsay Felton back. Skater Tara Lipinski is amusing in a sizeable role. Jon Cryer is funny as always. Jason Padgett are the John Hooper are the funny and handsome boyfriends of two girls. Such an entertaining movie for families to watch together!!!",1133395200,3,583,4.7254901960784315
8061435,5,B0009IW8LC,"My kids watched ""The Metro Chase"" and absolutely loved it. They are watching it again as I write this, and for once, it does not seem like a waste of time to me. By the way, the soundtrack is great!",1133222400,2,198,3.975
8061436,5,B0009IW8LC,"An outstanding performance from Christopher Plumley who steals the show! A really nice kid's film that is best suited for the third grade and up. My younger kids like it, but don't quite get it. Why don't they put out more movies of this calibre for our children?",1133136000,2,263,4.5
