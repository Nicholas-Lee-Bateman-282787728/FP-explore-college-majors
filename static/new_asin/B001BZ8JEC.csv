8285322,4,B001BZ8JEC,This was a gift for my mother. I had bought her one before which wouldn't even play. This one plays but does have the Japanese writing on the bottom of the picture the whole way through the movie.,1516233600,,196,4.184210526315789
8285323,3,B001BZ8JEC,"This war film has a no plot and some action but focuses rather on the daily lives of the soldiers of WWII. Its a realistic look at what a G.I. endures each day during the war. Lots of time in the rain and mud. This film has some historical interest in that it was filmed right at the end of the war, and it features some of Ernie Pyles original writing when he was embedded with the troops, but it is dated, slow-moving and of only average interest.",1484092800,,449,4.113636363636363
