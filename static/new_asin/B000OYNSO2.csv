8187737,5,B000OYNSO2,"Hello, I am the producer of this video. I do agree with Ron that there is no narration in this DVD. That was done on purpose. This DVD is done in the style of the recent on the state of New Jersey flyover. There is continual music in the video which we selected after much  deliberation. Ron says that the DVD is poor quality.
I would like to say that we did use archival video from the very early 1990s. Video formats and technology has improved greatly since then. We used this older video
to show the changes that have occurred in Atlantic City in approximately 20 years. We certainly do have video that was shot in the last two years. So this is an explanation for what I think Ron must mean. Yes there is no narration in this DVD but that's the way it was designed and I make no apologies for that.
This video is available as video on demand for  somewhat less money. Just go to Amazon's video on demand header and type in the title in fact, just copy paste
the following Welcome To Atlantic City thanks for being fair",1245024000,2,1023,4.241025641025641
