8725258,5,B0124F2J5W,"It's no secret Hulk Hogan's tenure in TNA was met with mixed reviews. The dvd is not worth 20 bucks. 10 at the most. I say buy it if you are a Hulk Hogan fan or True Blue TNA Fan. I liked Hogan when he brought in stars like Jeff Hardy and RVD into TNA in 2010. Jeff Hardy next to John Cena one of the most popular wrestlers of current generation. RVD ended up having a disappointing run with his run with the title all too brief and ending up getting lost in the shuffle.

  The bottom line was TNA needed to focus on their younger stars. Hulk Hogan made wrestling. Jeff Jarrett was never a draw but he was smarter to know to build his company around young stars. Hulk Hogan may have caused TNA a setback here it is 3 years later and TNA is still in business.

  Immortal was a dumb idea. Trying to recreate the NWO and 4 Horseman(Fortune) were terrible ideas. Wrestling fans needed something new in 2010 it's not 1997 anymore.  To be positive I thought The Bully Ray was great. I always thought Bubba could be a world champion and he found his character.

  In Hogan's Era we had Bobby Roode home grown TNA Talent become a World Champion and have a great run.  Mr. Anderson I didn't think needed to be in TNA they could have used someone else in the home grown TNA talent roster to take that place. I think Sting stepped in as World Champion and helped carry TNA when Jeff Hardy dropped the ball and let his demons get the best of him.

  I liked Hogan's run in TNA overall. It is great to see Hulk on wrestling. My favorite match was Hulk vs Sting at Bound For Glory they finally got it right 14 years later. WCW Starrcade 1997 Sting was supposed to beat Hulk but we all know how that turned out. A lot of the same stuff can be found on the dvd 'TNA Immortal' that is the better dvd.

  I found this dvd to be too short but it got all the Major Hulk Moments in TNA and his interactions with his fans. I give it 5 stars because I am a Hulk Hogan fan and I think when Hulk came to TNA in 2010 at that stage of his career did the best he could to make TNA better. But like I say TNA is still in business and has recreated itself. The Hogan Era in TNA will always be a fun one to revisit. Excuse while I eat my vitamins, do my training and say my prayers!",1474243200,,2253,4.015695067264574

8725261,2,B0124F2J5W,"There's so much to be said about the name Hulk Hogan & professional wrestling/sports entertainment but when it comes to his time in TNA, that is definitely a controversial subject for various reasons (another subject for another time) but TNA put together a set featuring various highlights from his time in the company.

Matches Include:
No Disqualification Match w/Abyss vs. A.J. Styles & Ric Flair - This was originally planned to be the first match of the night but after a few minutes, Sting appeared only to attack Hogan & Abyss with Flair & Styles joining in leaving Hogan a bloody mess causing Hogan to have the match rescheduled for later in the night under ""no disqualification"" rules. Hogan's head is bandaged from the assault by Sting earlier & starts out with Flair brawling on the floor leading to Flair being opened up. Flair tried chopping & punching Hogan to no avail with Hogan returning everything Flair gave him & went as far as to whip Flair with his weight belt in the ring. Flair had to resort to dirty tactics to gain some offense tagging in A.J. Styles who reopened the cut from earlier & beat on Hogan in front of his daughter Brooke building up to the hot tag to Abyss. This was a fun back & forth match that was entertaining with the aftermath being full of complete chaos with appearances from Desmond Wolfe, D'Angelo Dinero, and the return of Jeff Hardy.
""Impact"" Mar. '10
[Immortal Forever; TNA's Greatest Moments]

vs. Sting - This match was for control of TNA as Hogan came out in his street clothes as he made it clear that he wasn't going to wrestle but instead fight Sting while Sting came out in his gear wearing a red & yellow ""Hulkamania"" shirt. Dixie Carter was sitting in the front row while Hogan revealed that Ric Flair was going to be in his corner with the special twist being that the referee was ""Jackson James"" who was revealed earlier in the night to be Eric Bischoff's son Garrett. Hogan kept overpowering Sting early while Flair got his shots in the floor whenever possible including both men hitting low blows on Sting. Hogan used a weapon given to him by Flair to bust Sting open before Sting was able to fight off both men & use the weapon to make Hogan bleed before delivering Stinger Splashes to Hogan's bad back followed by the Scorpion Deathlock. The aftermath here was the real story as we saw Immortal come out, the battle of the Bischoff's, and the REAL Hulk Hogan return. The match was what you would expect knowing Hogan's condition but what happened with Hogan afterwords was suppose to come off as ""he saw the light"" (think Darth Vader saving Luke Skywalker in Return Of The Jedi) but just the way it happened came off very flat.
Bound For Glory '11
[Best Of Sting]

w/Sting & James Storm vs. Kurt Angle, Bobby Roode, Bully Ray - This was a ""never before seen"" match from the ""Maximum Impact"" tour of Europe as Hogan was in his street clothes for this match in what was a pretty basic tag match with Angle & Roode & Bully using their numbers to single out one opponent at a time with double & triple teaming while constantly causing distractions for the referee to turn his back to the action allowing them to take advantage both on the floor & on the outside building to the hot tag to Hogan in the final minute of the match.
Maximum Impact Tour '12

Other material include his press conference from Madison Square Garden, debut on Impact, final moments of Team Hogan vs. Team Flair at Lockdown, appearance at Wembley Arena in London, the formation of ""Immortal"", a brawl with Bully Ray along with Aces & Eights, an interview of Hogan, and the Before The Bell special on his Bound For Glory match with Sting.

As I said earlier, a lot can be said about Hogan's time in TNA but lets be honest here in that he was mostly used to talk more than anything else as his physical ability was extremely limited & with TNA is mostly ignoring their previous DVD collections with these new sets as most of these highlights were seen on the previous ""Immortal"" DVD set while everything else here isn't worth going out of your way to see. Backstage politics & internet ""dirt sheet"" news aside only to strictly looking at the product produced here that it's obvious to me that TNA decided to put this set out trying to capitalize on the recent fame Hogan has gained for himself recently in WWE (similar to their Sting set a few months ago) but with no matches & segments here that have stood the test of time or worth going out of your way to get, this is a set that I can only recommend for die hard Hulk Hogan fans but not recommend to anyone else.",1438992000,2,4601,4.492234169653525
