4471136,4,B004UVYR1I,"This was a really nice tittle for yugioh, but it was only an hour long the duel with paradox is only 4 rounds long but it was still pretty good. The marketing sucked, it was only shown 1 time each day for 2 weekends, the only way you could of found out about it was on yugioh-card.com as one of the tiny ads below the yugioh online thing. But as its self it should have been a tv special little turttles forever or something like that. But compaired to the yugioh pyiramid of light movie this sucks. this didn't have the conflic of yugi v. kaiba and later with anibus enstead it involed the crimson dragon from 5ds taking yusei and jaden back to the time we asume takes place in the fairly small space between grand championship and dawn of the duel. Paradox comes to destroy Maximillion in order to make sure duel monsters dies because it destoryed the future beyond 5ds or some thing like that which make really no sence because by that time deul monster likely would have not been effected all to much. The best part is thatparadox is the first one in the sereis to make fun of yugi's speaches on friendship. A really close second is that the credits played all 4 of the yugioh themes( yugioh, gx, 5ds and, battle city in that order) with a really nice desplay of vairous cards and combos used in the ""movie."" But overall buy it but don't buy it for more than maybe $20",1307577600,6,1372,4.301158301158301

4471148,2,B004UVYR1I,"As a fan of the original Yu-Gi-Oh anime, I have to say this is pretty lame.  The main duel in the movie is just not interesting.  As far as the villain goes, Paradox is just boring.  I mean he has a time travelling motorcycle?  That's kinda strange even by anime standards.

So really if you liked the original anime, you may want to skip this one.",1495584000,,348,4.212121212121212

I also watched the english dub and it was also great due to the fact that it had everyone's original voice actors but mainly hearing Yugi's voice, oh nostalgia. Also kudos for 4Kids or 4K Media for not cutting out or editing anything, actually, I was expecting to see the full card text in this movie just like Pyramid of Light did but no, just the usual English dub edit for the cards you see in the anime.",1459468800,,540,4.252427184466019

Overall, this movie was pretty good - I'd say it had more of a basis on Yusei in the 5Ds series than anything but still fun to see all the characters come together. A majority of the movie was them all battling the bad guy - no real back story about the characters or even really them talking and finding out about each other. Once again, it was just fun to see all the characters come together but if you hope to for them to have fun and learn about each other or even you learn more about the characters - this is not the movie for that. Overall really can't complain, just wish there was more of a story line to it than anything.",1412121600,,715,4.042253521126761

4471347,4,B004UVYR1I,"My son has grown up watching all the various anime, and he also checked all the original (Yugi) manga out of the library one summer.  Since the TV is in my office, I've kind of absorbed a lot of it as he went along, to the point where the two of us now have our own duel decks and so on.  When we saw this DVD on Amazon we decided to buy it.  I've always liked Yusei best of all the protagonists, because he seems to have a more focused and grownup approach to life, whereas Jaden is always wisecracking and not really taking life too seriously.  Well, they were certainly true to character; Yusei was all mopey and depressed about possibly losing the joint duel, and Jaden jollied him right out of it.  So in that respect I really enjoyed Jaden being in this movie.  Of course in a duel movie the resolution is pretty much a foregone conclusion, although the ending did leave us wondering just what happened to Paradox.

Also, the fact that Yugi had once dueled two brothers named Para and Dox had confused us prior to the movie start.  We thought this bad guy was something to do with them.

And lastly, Yuma is not in this movie, and we didn't know why; my son theorized that Paradox was Yuma gone bad, but apparently not.  We don't know much about Paradox or his time era, just that it was a wasteland and that Duel Monsters made it that way.  So, I knock off a star for incomplete storytelling, and because they could have used a different name for the bad guy to avoid confusion with the old Para-Dox brothers.",1405728000,,1516,4.302816901408451

Good film but not great. If you were a fan of any of the three animated series you will most likely like this. However if its anything like the animated series (at least state side) i'm slightly worried a few things may get edited out of it. If so i am curious as to what would be edited out. The story kind of feels like it should have been a half and hour, that got stretched into an hour. But then again seeing at least two people i know from the series (havn't watched the new series) end up in Full HD is really nice. The picture is crisp, audio is good, I would buy this if i didn't already have the UK version.",1404691200,,793,3.9316770186335406

This  is  the  darkest  a  Yu-Gi-Oh  will  ever  get  no  where  near as  dark  as  the  manga  but  still  pretty  ballsy  as  far  as  a  Yu-Gi-Oh movie  goes  i  am  a  hugh  fan  of  the  franchise  the  manga  is  great,  the  4kids  adaptation  isn't  that  bad  it  had  dark  edge  to  it  and  was  a lot  of  fun  i  am  so  glad  cinedigm  is
releasing  the  first  5  seasons  of  the  original  series. Hoping  that  they  release  the  complete Yu-Gi-Oh GX set  as  well  as  5Ds.

Update review for  the Blu-Ray

I pre-ordered  the  Blu-Ray of Bonds  beyond  and i  am  extremely  impressed  with  the  Quality  of  the  Blu-Ray
itself  first  the  video  quality  imo the  gets  a 4 1/2out of 5  this  was  a  gorgeous looking  anime  kudos  to cinedigm there  is  a  bit  of  softness  during  the  halfway  mark  of  the  film  but  that's  about  it.

Now  the  Audio...  HOLY #%*@! the  audio  was  friggin amazing! 5/5  simply  stunning  this  soundtrack  will  definitely  wake  the  neighbors  it is  a  very  aggressive and  immersive  5.1 DTS-HD-MA mix  and  it  was  just  awesome  to  here  all  of  the  those  trademark Yu-Gi-Oh  sounds  in  theater  quality  sound.",1404518400,,1436,4.25
4471353,5,B004UVYR1I,"I saw this movie, Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time 3D, at the movie theater. I felt like a little kid again, seeing one of my favorite childhood shows on the big screen, especially seeing the cast of 5D's in it. I'm thrilled this is finally going to be released on DVD! I have the original Japanese version, but I like seeing the English version as well. Can't wait to add it to my collection!",1402617600,,388,4.328767123287672
4471354,4,B004UVYR1I,One time I seen this film in theater back in 2011 and it feels like three years had passed; I used to watch it on YouTube couple of times and now it is coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray on 7/15/14. All kids would love to see it again.,1402099200,,226,3.8297872340425534
4471355,3,B004UVYR1I,"Back in 2011 this was released in UK so I bought that one and I have to say that I wasn't very pleased, don't get me wrong, Yu-Gi-Oh! on Blu-ray? Yes please, but the picture quality is an upscale of 540p to 1080p resolution, so yeah it's not very good for a high definition release.

On the UK release they included a free card (""Super Rare Trading Card"") and the Blu-ray offered a 3D version of the film too, although I never used either of these things, and heck, the card still remains factory sealed. 3DTVs just have never interested me at all.

.:Technical information:.

1) Languages: Japanese (LPCM 2.0) , English (LPCM 5.1)
2) Aspect Ratio: 16:9 (Widescreen)
3) Subtitles: English
4) Film's Length: 60mins (English Edt.)
5) Rating: PG
6) Bonus' Features Runtime: 61mins (Japanese edt.)

Aside from the picture quality being less than satisfying for a Blu-ray release this is a pretty decently cool Blu-ray to own of Yu-Gi-Oh!.

P.S.: On the comments section of my review I included links of the photos of the UK Blu-ray release.",1400025600,,1036,4.701657458563536
4471356,5,B004UVYR1I,"I'm glad this is coming out and that they brought out the first yugioh series again, but will they do the same for the Gx series as well and not just the first season but also the 2nd, 3rd, and also make the forth in English audio as well? And will they make the 5ds series to as well and have both seasons including episodes that didn't appear in the second season?",1397088000,,366,4.097222222222222

4471358,4,B004UVYR1I,"Yes! This movie is FINALLY coming out here in the US. It was originally slated to come out in 2011-2012, somewhere around that time, but it was only released in the UK, for some reason, before 4Kids lost the rights to the series & the movie didn't come out here in the US for some reason. I did like the movie more than Pyramid of Light, as I saw it after someone uploaded the English dub on YouTube. The only thing I'm confused about, is why isn't it coming out in a Blu-Ray 3D combo pack as well? Or is it? It did in the UK, but not in this country for some reason. Also, is the Japanese audio track going to be on here too? Is it also the extended uncut version 4Kids dubbed too?
4Kids dubbed it uncut, as it was a movie & they didn't have to contend with American censoring standards, so is it going to have the Japanese audio version & is it going to be uncut as well? I've read that it's going to, but I'm not too sure.
I'm confused as to whether they are going to release it like that, or not. I'm not doubting that it's most likely gonna be uncut, but is it also gonna have the Japanese audio with English, accurate, subtitles for that version?
Also, are they SERIOUSLY going to release this movie before GX & 5Ds? I don't mind it. It just seems a bit weird.
Also, Cinedigm originally distributed this movie for 4Kids, when they owned the license, so how come they haven't released it by now already?
God, this is worse than analyzing plot holes in the series.
Can anyone answer me these questions? I'd really like to talk about this stuff.",1396137600,4,1548,4.215488215488215

The U.K. gets a 3D Blu Ray release. It's even listed at Amazon.comUK for preorder. Does the U.S. get it? I have a 3Dtv and really want this movie on 3D Blu Ray. I don't think I can order the U.K. version because it's listed as PAL Region B...which usually means it won't play in a U.S. player. I can't find any listings anywhere in the U.S. for preordering a 3D Blu Ray of this movie. I hope the U.S. doesn't get blown off without a 3D Blu Ray of Bonds Beyond Time! Why would they release a 3D Blu Ray in the U.K. but not the U.S.?",1310256000,3,623,4.191666666666666

8442344,5,B004UVYR1I,I am a 5Ds fan but really did like this movie and it was nice of them to combine all three characters into this movie.  I purchased it on a hunch because I like Yuseif and I am glad I did.  I will have to agree with one of the reviewers it was more so about the 5Ds than the other two but I thought they did a good job at connecting everything together.  So if you are a 5Ds fan like me you will love this movie I hope.,1526947200,,419,3.6333333333333333
