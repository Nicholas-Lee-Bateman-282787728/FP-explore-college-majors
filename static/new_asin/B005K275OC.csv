This DVD is not misleading, deceptive, or inaccurate because it is the DVD version of the film it claims to be, and it is a complete reproduction of the same film--a 1949 Scottish film titled _Floodtide_, based on a George Blake novel, which tells the story of a precocious lad named David Shields who successfully works his way up from an entry-level position as a riveter to a leading ship designer and to an engagement with the boss' daughter at a major Glasgow shipbuilding company.  The film celebrates shipbuilding and Glasgow working class culture, at the peak of shipbuilding's dominance over Glasgow's industrial economy, although in a highly consensualist manner, such that no class division or conflict appears (let alone any sign of significant sectarian division or conflict) and so that everyone seems content to contribute from where he is at, and according to whatever his station might be, to the greater good of the company as a whole.  David Shields is a classic Scottish 'lad 'o the pairts'--in American terms, a Horatio Alger-style rags to riches epitome of the ready opportunity for upward mobility available to anyone and everyone willing to work hard, and who has the drive and talent legitimately to earn such advancement.  In a climactic moment, David saves the ship he designed from the flood tide and overcomes a temporary falling out with his bride to be at virtually the same time.  This is a romantic drama directed by Frederick Wilson starring Gordon Jackson, Rona Anderson, John Laurie, Jack Lambert, James Logan, and Janet Brown.  It is noteworthy for offering a fictional feature-length cinematic representation of modern urban working class Scottish life, at play as well as at work, in contrast with the traditions of Tartanry and Kailyardism which focus on romantically pre-modern images of imaginary rural Scotlands based in the Highands and the Islands.  And this film is also noteworthy for casting a significant number of leading Scottish actors of the time speaking in accents authentic to the Glasgow of the time, while also depicting recognizable Glasgow and Clydeside locations of the time, even as much of the story is filmed in the studio.",1362700800,,2336,5.036269430051814
