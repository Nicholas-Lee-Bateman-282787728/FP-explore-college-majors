I guess I do not understand why people are feeling misled.....or angry.  So worth watching.",1380499200,2,194,4.647058823529412
8154106,1,B000K2VIZO,Thank goodness I read the previous reviews before I wasted my time and money on this video. I too am a believer but I also want to learn pottery. They saved me a big hassel. Thanks.,1265760000,3,181,4.055555555555555
8154107,1,B000K2VIZO,"To look at the picture on the DVD you would think this was an instructional DVD.  Not so.  It is a preacher telling us how God made us from clay and I believe that He did just that.  I go to Church and I am a religious person and I appreciate the message.  However, I think to make people think this is an instructional video was and is wrong.  It should state that it is a sermon. I have no problem with the sermon and I will watch it eventually but right now I am interested in learning different pottery techniques. From now on I will read everything I can about what I am purchasing.",1203465600,12,587,4.069565217391304
8154108,1,B000K2VIZO,This is the biggest mistake I ever purchased in Amazon.  This is not an instructinal video that teaches about pottery.  It's about a pastor using  pottery making process to preach how God transforms and remakes people.  There is nothing about how to thown pottery.  The pastor is a good potter.  But I didn't buy the DVD to hear him preach or see his pottery works.,1171929600,27,365,4.538461538461538
