7986221,5,B00008OTSK,A parent might not know where to start with a conversation like this but it has to be done! Teach your kids to fight back before its too late. Scary world out there- better to get hurt fighting someone off then to be missing forever.,1368057600,,233,4.2
7986222,5,B00008OTSK,"Just had a chance to watch the video with my kids last night.  Very easily one of the best Martial arts Self-defense video's I've seen. And easily the BEST Kids oriented Self-defense instructional video.  With over 7 years experience in martial arts, I highly recommend this video for any parent who wants to teach their child about protecting themselves. Both instructors seem very knowledgable, the topics covered are very pertanent: chokes, grabs, escapes.  Something even my 5 year old was able to do.  [...]",1215043200,,512,5.059523809523809
7986223,5,B00008OTSK,"I wasn't sure what Kids fighting chance was about. Was it self defense? I had just heard that it was what our kids were missing in their safety. Would it scare them? I cannot believe no one has thought to do this before. Teaching our kids how to be PRO active, how to avoid these creeps to begin with, how to get away, rescue themselves if they are grabbed. How to avoid being put into a vehicle and even many ways to actually disable a vehicle and escape!
My kids love it and I love it. Its not a major hollywood production but it really works. If you have kids actually any age, believe me it is what we have all been missing in teaching and protecting our children. Bravo!",1058227200,6,675,4.2
