7878074,5,6304843399,"I do not own this particular DVD.  Judging from other reviewers, its unfortunate that the poor transfer and DVD quality did not do the movie the justice it deserves.  This is an excellent movie, not just because of the action.  The love story was hauntingly beautiful and the fate of the Vietnamese boat people were heart breaking and real.  I know at least 2 friends from Vietnam that their real life stories were just as touching and movie worthy.  If you happen to find a better version next time you go to China town, do give it a second try.  Keep in mind though that the movie was shot in the 80s so even the best transfer would not be of HD quality.  My copy is more than watchable and I loved the movie.",1431648000,,711,4.2611940298507465

7878076,1,6304843399,"This transfer is absolutely horrid.  I have probably hundreds of 'budget' dvds and this is absolutely the worst transfer that I have seen to date.

To further amplify the first reviewer's comments, the subtitles are not only hard to read but generally IMPOSSIBLE to read.  The bottom line of the subtitles is nearly always unreadable.

Stay away from this and look for a Hong Kong version instead.  Beverly Wilshire transfers are always among the worst of the budget dvd's.",1090800000,7,473,4.936708860759493
7878077,1,6304843399,"One of the worst DVD transfers we have seen to date.  Subtitles were imprinted on the original film, and frames jump all over the screen, making them impossible to read.  Not to mention overall bad quality of video and audio.  Otherwise, could be a something for Chow Yun Fat fans.",1008806400,10,281,4.58
7878078,4,6304843399,"""God of Killers"" is yet another in a long line of retitled Hong Kong films designed to get the unsuspecting public to either rent or buy a title that they may have previously seen.  This 1981 film was Chow's first major starring role and he's excellent here.  But why change the name of the film from the original ""The Story of Woo Viet?""  There's really no need to do so.  ""The Story of Woo Viet"" is a serious drama/character study and features fine acting from Chow who had worked for years in Hong Kong television and was trying to make the move to feature films.  In Fact, ""The Story of Woo Viet"" did well at the box office, but for the next several years, Chow's films did not do so well and it wasn't until 1985 that he finally broke through and he hasn't looked back since.  By the way, those looking for a John Woo style action film will be sadly disappointed; this is very definitely a character study, with an unhappy ending, that showcases Chow's acting talent.
In all honesty, I cannot rate the VHS versions being offered by Amazon, as the copy that I have of this film was presented on DVD (that I picked up for five bucks at a Pathmark grocery store!).  However, based on internet research that I have done on this film, I recommend that potential buyers stay away from the Arena Video version.  While there's very little in the way of the usual crappy English dubbing (there are a few scenes spoken in English), the Arena version has the English subtitles cut-off at the bottom of the screen for large chunks of the film as does my budget DVD from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks (who are based in New York!).
Bottom line:  As this was Chow Yun-Fat's first major film role in a superior Hong Kong film, viewers ought to give it a look.  Just be careful with the version that you are buying.  Buyer beware!",990057600,4,1815,4.42042042042042
