774317,5,630406182X,"Wow.  Drunken boxing is an ancient chinese martial art form where the artist fights in a drunken manner.  In this movie, the actors are sober, but boy can they fight. Anyone who watches Jackie Chan movies knows the stunts and death defying stunts, and the amazing... stunts.  This movie was made in the 1980s and has to be the of Chan's movies.  All the stunts are real and in your face, just like all of Chan's movie but this film like most re-released films was originally made in Chinese.  Chan is very comical in chinese (among other things, he sings quite well also, in fact he sings in the end credits).  The comedy comes through just as well in english.  The stunts in this movie are faster than the stock market on a hot day.  Definately a great movie.",970790400,2,760,4.41726618705036

He is not in it, and I'm sure he has not allowed this movie to be released, especially using his name because HE IS NOT IN IT! There are a few short clips of Drunken Master spliced into it, but nothing else! I am getting my money back ASAP.

774319,5,630406182X,"If you like Martial Arts movies you have to get these two movies, in my opinion part one is only topped by part two when it comes to the fighting  scenes, but the story is actually better on part one.

774433,2,630406182X,There seemed to be no special features as advertised.  Just the movie and a couple of different language options. It was also not the same English dub i was used to. A couple of times the lines were different and it seemed less funny and enjoyable. Kinda was disappointed because i thought a blue ray would have been the best buy for this movie.  But none the less jackie Chan is still a legend and looks epic.,1497139200,,410,4.311688311688312
774434,3,630406182X,"The three stars are not a commentary on the film (which is excellent) but rather the Blu-ray disc itself. For your audio options you have the English dub or... the English dub with the occasional Cantonese track coming in and out. For whatever reason, you can't listen to this film in its original language in its entirety. Unacceptable. The captions are also dubtitles, so you can't even have the benefit of experiencing the original language in *any* context. I can't speak to how loyal the English dub is to the original script, but the voice work is entertaining enough that I can enjoy the film without much in the way of cringing.

For some reason, the release sold here is Region 2. I was concerned that it wouldn't play, but the movie works fine on a Region 1 Blu-Ray player. The special features, however, do *not*. Any attempt to access them just brings you to a black screen.

Overall, this Blu-ray release is massively disappointing. Buy this only if you're content to watch the movie dubbed and without special features.",1494806400,7,1033,4.733333333333333

774438,2,630406182X,"I would rate the movie as 4 stars, only point off would be the video quality. Alas, this is a dubbed version, which I dislike, and the dub quality is terrible, which I hate. I went and found the pirated subbed version on thepiratebay, and it was worth every penny. 2/5",1491868800,,268,4.2745098039215685
774439,4,630406182X,"Many of Chans earlier films have nearly identical stories. Drunken Master, Fearless Hyena, Young Master and (if I remember correctly) Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin are all extremely similar dealing with a foolish young master who is trained by an actual master of kung fu and the training is rigorous, likeridiculously rigorous, even like pouring scalding water over you while you have to stay perfectly formed in a chair stance rigorous; some would call it torture. And when the actual master ends up being severely beaten and/or killed it is up to the youthful young master to defeat/ exact vengeance upon the villain. How does Jackie Chans original Drunken Master differentiate itself from the pact of his other similar features? By playing up the master-student dynamic to more comical effect and of course by having Chan learn the drunken master fighting form. The remade/ revised version known in the States as The Legend of the Drunken Master is far superior to the original and is just a ton of fun. The original here can be recommended on its own merits but I would steer the prospective viewer to Fearless Hyena first. Be careful though not to watch too many of these too close to each other as they will blend like a kaleidoscope in your minds eye. 3.75 stars for a poor ending and for not wearing so well with age; not quite classic.",1489708800,,1347,4.736170212765957

774522,1,630406182X,"This release of the movie is terrible.  The language switches between Cantonese and English while watching.  Even worse, frames were removed at key points so you cannot see the Kung Fu.

774808,1,630406182X,"I am so upset. I purposely bought this version so I did NOT have to have the English Dubbed version only. Like one of the other reviewers stated if you choose Cantonese language with English Subs, it will change back and forth between English Dubbed and Cantonese at random. I personally can't stand Chinese movies dubbed even though that's how I grew up with them. If you are looking for the Dubbed version this is the copy for you otherwise buyer beware.
Amazon did give me a refund because it was fulfilled by them through another seller, but I don't want the money I wanted the correct film. It's also telling that they told me NOT to return the DVD!! they are just giving a refund. Anyone want a free movie!!??
Buyer Beware!
WOW, I just looked at Wikipedia and this Columbia released version is KNOWN to have the audio skip back and forth. This is DEFINITELY something Amazon should let people know up front. No wonder they didn't want the DVD back!!",1426118400,2,955,4.526011560693641

774811,5,630406182X,"Probably the first kung-fu movie I have watched as a child, I might have been 8 or 9 years old.  This is actually, a kung-fun comedy, which makes it even more note-worthy.  One of the better films of Jackie Chan from his earlier years but if you ask me all of his best films come from the 70's and 80's. Drunken Master (1978) was a break-through film for Jackie Chan that kicked-off his career as a star in Hong Kong action flicks. The film is about a disobedient youngster (Jackie) who likes to goof around with his friends, but when one day his bad behavior spirals out of control, his father decides to send for a well-known kung-fu master who is notorious for his wine drinking and tough discipline.  Soon after, Jackie's character learns kung-fu fighting while under the influence :)

774854,3,630406182X,"Goofy Jackie Chan movie, made in 1978, five years after he appeared as an extra in Bruce Lee's Enter The Dragon, and two years after his first starring role in a film (and the one he adopted his Chinese stage name Cheung Long for) New Fist Of Fury, came this little masterpiece, the first Drunken Master. It's a goofy kung fu rumble from beginning to end, with about half of the approximately 90 minutes of running time devoted to one-on-one kung fu fighting; the rest of it is hijinks, training, and a bit of lesson-learning by Chan. Nice lady kung fu at the beginning, and there's a great scene of Chan eating a huge meal all by himself a la Cool Hand Luke and his eggs. Great fun, but definitely a far cry from the later Jackie Chan goofiness. Jackie is bare-chested for much of the film, and we get several shots of his upper body.",1420070400,,835,4.358974358974359

774857,5,630406182X,"This is absolutely the epitome of martial arts films. Jackie Chans Drunken Master has it all folks; its got enchanting romance, sizzling action, and a whole boatload of humor. Known as the film that shot a young Chan into stardom, Drunken Master continues to stun its viewers to this day. We begin with a young Wong Fei-Hung, played by Jackie Chan, getting into all sorts of troubles. Once word of his mischief reaches his fathers ears, Fei-Hung is forced to train harder in martial arts as we are introduced to his new harsh mentor, Beggar So, played by Yuen Siu-Tien. Over the course of the film, Chan and Yuen train hard in the arts of drunken boxing, spilling blood, sweat and wine. Lots and lots of wine.

  The choreography of the fight scenes are beautiful. They bring tears to my eyes. With each punch thrown, I shed another drop. With each kick kicked, I swallow my pride and let my emotions run wild. I stand and I scream, Jackie!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot bring myself to sit down anymore. I must stand and I must cheer. This is how beautiful the choreography is. The best scene is the final fight scene where Jackie faces off against Hwang Jang Lee, who plays Thunderleg, a Korean Taekwondo master whose kicks are so fast you cannot even fathom the speed at which they are traveling. They most likely exceed 50 m/s.

  Every time Jackie takes a swig from his wine gourd, I cannot help but cheer. Every drunken step he takes, every drunken remark he makes, it is golden. I think, What a man. What a man! I encourage his alcoholism. I encourage his addiction. Every time Jackie gets drunk, I squeal. But I do not squeal like a pig in reality. Every time I see someone take another shot when they are already drunk, I cry. I cry for hope. I cry for a better future for these addicts. Alcoholism is a serious problem and if someone you love or know suffers from this problem, you should call the alcohol hotline at 866-925-4030, or visit their website at www.alcoholhotline.com.

  The music is amazing. Drunken Master is set in China, so the music is very Chinese. I love the music because it is very kung-fu. I have never heard such kung-fu music before in my life. In fact, the music shines best when Chan and Yuen are having a training montage. This is a post-Rocky montage, so you know it has to be up to the Rocky standards. What is even more amazing is that the beats match up with the choreography. The kicks are paired with drums; the hand strikes are pair up with the squeaky eeeeeee sound of the instrument I do not know the name of.

  Overall, I would call Drunken Master one of my top 5 movies. I mean, its got it all: the romance, the drunkenness, the fighting, the music, the alcohol, the punches, the heroism, the moral. I can safely say that Drunken Master is, without a doubt, a solid gold film.",1417478400,,2815,4.46588693957115

While this isn't another Shaw production, it is directed by master martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Ping even cast his father in this film for the role of the drunken master.

It's interesting to see a much younger Jackie Chan (only about 23 years old), you can tell he is very dedicated to his craft which is why his skills only improved over time. Expect this one to play out as you think it would, the action isn't on the level of Legend of the Drunken Master but if you like kung fu you should not be disappointed.",1399334400,3,680,4.396825396825397

This is Jackie Chan debut movie.
I like this dvd version because it has the old version from Golden Harvest which is hard to find - digitally remasted format  , it has  the famous line - so you fancy you know some kung fu, the other part where they say "" that's called Hungry dog eat S h i t - cracks me up.  The picture quality for the Columbia Tristar version which is a little bit crispier copy but most people won't  be able to tell. Columbia did a horrible dubbing job, why waste of time and money restoring it ?  Their dubbing is a lot better to understand but there are parts to the movie that the english dubbing job is done badly - should of just left it alone instead of repairing it. The old Golden Harvest version is not the best but a whole lot better than the Columbia Tristar.

Other than that - reviewers with 5 stars are right.  Only one minor complaint is up to date they don't have it Anamorphic Widescreen 16x9 format so that you can view it can be a little bit bigger where the black bars on top & bottom has only 1 inch or 1/2 inch left - that way you can still view everything instead of Full screen.

So Hei is an aged little drunkard but he is notortious across the land for his formidable kung fu-""the secrets of the eight drunken gods.""  initially freddy finds So Hei's gruelling methods and drills too much and runs away. he meets Thunderleg, a local assassin who is renowned for his incredible kicking style of kung fu. bullied and utterly humiliated by him, freddy runs back to So Hei, angered and invigorated to learn his ""secret style"", drunken kung fu. after a bad deal over local real estate, Thunderleg is employed to kill freddy's father. freddy finds them just in time and promises to make amends with his father and protect him from the evil Thunderleg as So Hei watches from a distance, confident freddy will not need his help.

In 1978 a film came out that in my opinion revolutionized the industry and made one man a superstar, that film was ""Jui Kuen aka Drunken Master"" and that man was Jackie Chan. At the time movies were just not done like this especially in the Kung-Fu area until Chan stepped the game up, the original Kung Fu Hustle you could say. I have loved this film since the first time I was privileged to see it and truly believe it is one of the all time greats in film history, not just in its own genre. I can honestly say that I have never met any one who did not like this movie, any one who had seen it that is.

Wong Fei-Hung [Chan] is a very gifted and talented young man but his inability to take his craft seriously won't let him achieve his full potential. He acts out and does not listen to any one including his teacher at his father's school; in fact he likes to show the teacher up. He is also fond of showing up any and every one that he pleases and can but an unfortunate event involving a woman and her daughter land him in hot water with his father. After countless times of trying to make him learn a little something his father decides to bring in outside help in the form of Su Hua Chi [Siu Tien Yuen], a master of the 8 Drunken Gods fighting styles. Of course Wong is not keen on the idea and runs off in order to escape his responsibilities. That all changes after a brawl at a restaurant were the master saves him, and then begins to train him. The training is not going all that well and Wong runs off again only to run into a hit man named Thunderleg [Jang Lee Hwang] who destroys him and makes him realize how little he knows. Add in the fact that this man is out to kill his father Wong must now take his training seriously in order to not only save his father but find himself as well.

This film has got to be one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen in my life as it is full of excellent fight sequences and full of great humor. This was the first of its kind mixing the martial arts with slapstick humor and this happened because Jackie wanted to have a separate identity from Bruce Lee. What a grand idea it was because the result was this master piece that also added a new twist on an old character. Wong was one of the most popular characters in the genre's history and was a very serious character, until Chan came with this. The fight sequences are also another up side to this wonder film has with most Jackie flicks the film shines when he is on screen doing his thing. The actual fighting is amazing and the comedy gags mixed in with his facial expressions only add to the good time.

Directed by Woo-ping Yuen who was also a writer along side producer See-Yuen Ng and Hsiao Lung this is by far a classic and is well worth any price that is asked in my opinion. This DVD comes with a wonderful commentary that is full of info and is very interesting, and some trailers.

Writer: Hsiao Lung
 This picture directed by the famed fighting choreographer  Yuen Woo Ping is one of the best kung fu comedy today. It includes Jackie Chan and one of my personal hero's in the old school martial arts Simon Yuen Siu Tin. He Is the original master in these movies for example Blind fist of Bruce. One of my favorite movies by the Bruce lee clones. This is one of Yuen first directing jobs before he  was commissioned bye American fat heads to try to liven up there garbage with his flawless fight choreography skills.

This Jackie' take on the Canton born Chinese hero Wong Fei Hong. Movies before this about legendary Wong Fei Hong who was a master in the  Hung Gar Boxing were very traditional in terms of keeping the already legendary persona of  traditional film. Cantonese entertainment depicted him sense the turn of the century. Jet Li did wonder rendition of Wong in film produce by Tsui Hark called Ounce Upon a time in China. After seeing the success of this film Jackie decided to make Drunken Master 2 to show he was the best at there depiction of Wong. This is the original and you can almost feel it. However there is only and difference he plays it for laughs. This is probable the first films which depicted Wong Fei Hong like a misfit who doesn't fit in. Beware this version is cut however as stated in the commentary this is a version brought straight from Hong Kong? (Or it could be that the tryed to Americanize it)Bastards. So to see the films in its whole entirety you will have to go else were. To next reason why you should by this is the commentary, which by itself stands alone. There's Ric Meyers, the author Great Martial Arts Movies from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, and Jeff Yang the co-author of I am Jackie Chan My Life in Action.

Unfortunately, they also include unwatchably agonizing humor and snail-paced fight scenes... even the final one.  Hwang Jang Lee is pretty good as the main villain, and the last fight is the best of the movie, but is still very ssssllllow[...]

Some of my criticisms may be unwarrantable.  I've seen a lot of old kung fu movies that swiped a lot of things from this one.  Simon Yuen's portrayal of the crabby old master has been re-used ad nauseam, often by him.  This is certainly a stepping-stone in the evolution of kung fu cinema, and for that alone it's worth a viewing.  Otherwise I would avoid it. Jackie himself used this formula, sans alcohol, for most of his films that followed this, like ""Fearless Hyena"", which for some reason, I liked a lot more.

The picture has been remastered and is very good.  The dubbing feature is poor and will switch to Cantonese every once in a while, but it really makes no difference.  If you want really cool drunken kung fu, check out the 1994 sequel.

775335,3,630406182X,"I've watched this movie dozens of times. It's Jackie Chan's best and one of the best kung fu films ever. However, I used to watch this on vhs, so when this remastered dvd came out I got really excited to see it and add it to my collection but was dissapointed not long after it started.

You see, on the vhs version, the english dubbed voices and dialog are different. I am so used to that version that it's actually quite difficult to enjoy this movie the same on dvd. The same thing happened from the original Iron Monkey vhs to the Quentin Tarantino presents version. It really throws me off. It may not sound like a big deal but what if someone suddenly re-released Star Wars with different voices and some changed dialog. No, this is not Star Wars but you get the idea. This one even has profanity that was completely absent in the older version. Most people probably won't notice it or realize it as this'll be the first version they've seen but I write this for me and for those who had the same reaction I did. I'm gonna try to hunt down an older dvd with original dubbing cause it's just so different. Other than that, the transfer is good and you'll see some of the best kung fu you'll see anywhere. Its a 5 star film for sure.

The sign of truly quality kung fu is how long the camera stays on the action without switching angles. In these switches, the actors usually stop, then restart a new series of moves, only memorizing a few moves at a time. In almost all of Jackie Chan's older movies, you'll see the camera stay on for a long, stringed together series of movements and you'll only then really appreciate the talent it takes to put those in succession over a long length of time. It'll change the way you look at action and fighting sequences in movies. You'll see some cheap films where the actors throw 2 or 3 punches then stop, 2 or 3 more moves, then stop and repeat. But Jackie puches, kicks, jumps, rolls, ducks, and repeats and repeats in one camera shot!!! He's truly amazing and is the greatest movie martial artist I've ever seen. For you football fans out there, he's the Barry Sanders of kung fu. Nobody moves like Jackie. Many people are quick to point out Bruce Lee as the greatest martial artist ever and in the real world, maybe he was, but when it comes to kung fu movies, he's not even close to Jackie Chan.

775492,4,630406182X,"There's any number of reason to like international film star Jackie Chan...his superior athletic ability, infectious sense of humor, personable charm, but I think the one element that endears him to me is his willingness to put himself in the position of serious physical harm in order to entertain the audience.  Sure there are attempts to minimize the risks to some degree (meticulous planning and repetitive practicing), and given Chan's incredible physical prowess he's less likely to suffer harm than say I would trying to do half the things he does, but despite these factors, there is still the notion that with many of his stunts, particularly in his later films, he's always about a hair away from killing himself.  Anyway, directed by Woo-ping Yuen, who would later choreograph action scenes for the Matix and Kill Bill films, Drunken Master (1978) aka Jui kuen stars Jackie Chan (listed in the credits as Jacky) and Siu Tien Yuen (the director's father).

The film begins as an assassin named Thunderleg, Master of the Devil's Kick, searching out his most recent target in that of The Champion of the Four Door Fist (not all, but a lot of the characters have titles like this).  He finds him, a battle ensues, and one is left standing.  We then cut to a scene featuring students practicing martial arts in a school.  It's here we meet one of the pupils named Wong Fei-Hung (Chan), whose father actually runs the school.  Wong appears fairly adept (after showing up one of the teachers), but lacks the discipline and humility to achieve beyond his current skills, which becomes obvious to his father after a series of incidents involving a local bully, among others.  This leads Wong's father to request another to assume training of Wong in that of an older man who's rumored to be incredibly difficult and completely sadistic.  Wong decides to run away, but ends up meeting his new teacher (Siu Tien Yuen), a master of the 8 Drunken Gods fighting styles, after an altercation at a restaurant.  Wong begins his training with his new master, but soon runs off, as it's too difficult.  This sets up a chance meeting between Thunderleg and Wong were Wong gets the thrashing of a lifetime and ends up returning to the Drunken Master, realizing his own skills are pitiful.  This leads into a lengthy set of training sequences eventually leading to the Master teaching Wong the secret fighting tactics of the 8 Drunken Gods.  As Wong's training is completed, we find out a contract has been taken out on his father, one to be fulfilled by Thunderleg, so now Wong must put his training to the test in the fight of his life (or death).

I think I should mention, as a number of reviewers have brought it up, something about the partial English dubbing within the film.  The copy I received a little while ago has a little sticker on the back of the DVD case stating something in the way of `English substituted in some areas where original dialog track lost'.  The effect is that when you're watching the film with the original Cantonese audio track, using English subtitles, there are scenes where the characters switch from Cantonese to really goofy sounding voices speaking English.  This happens about three or four times, and it is a little annoying as it tended to draw me out of the film.  I would have preferred that, if some of the original audio were lost, a re-recording in the same language as the original dialog...but whatever...now on to the film.  The movie is crammed with excellent wall-to-wall fight scenes.  There are momentary lapses devoted to working on the plot, but these quickly pass resulting in more fight sequences.  I think my favorite sequence, besides the lengthy one at the end, featured Siu Tien Yuen in the restaurant, smacking assailants with a dishrag.  Not only was it really funny, but almost hypnotic as he twirled that towel around before rat tailing someone in the face (in case you're not familiar, `rat tailing' means taking a wet towel, twisting it up, and snapping it at poor individual).  Can anyone tell me what was up with that teacher Chan's character beats up on near the beginning?  The guy had this mole on his face, one that had this set of really long hairs emanating from it, and the guy could often be seen playing with the hair, twirling it with his fingers...it was pretty disgusting.  And what was the deal with that waiter from the restaurant?  Was that the biggest set of buckteeth you've ever seen?  I suppose these were some of what made up the comedic element of this film, but they weren't all that funny.  What was funny was the scene where Chan's character is trying to learn the drunken fighting style of the lone woman god, doing so in a mocking fashion as he thought it was too effeminate.  Another concept I found really funny was the whole notion of fighting styles based of being intoxicated, and the fact Wong's teacher was drunk throughout most of the film.  The choreography in the fighting scenes is really spectacular as Chan not only displays that psuedo comic fighting style he's famous for, but also a lot of serious chop socky.  Don't expect to see Chan doing any large scale, over the top stunts like leaping off building, as seen in his later films, but do expect lots of close up, smacky smacky action (he also takes the beating like no one I've ever seen).

The picture on this DVD is very good (some cropping), presented in 2.35:1 widescreen, enhanced for 16 X 9 TVs.  The monaural audio is decent, but certainly nothing to brag about.  Special features include a commentary track including Hong Kong film expert Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang, a co-author of Chan's autobiography.  Also included are trailers for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) and Time and Tide (2000).

This veeery broad kung fu comedy has a goofy, relaxed atmosphere to it that makes it enjoyable to watch.

The melodramatic (if almost non-existant) conflict between Chan and bad guy Hwang Jang Lee only adds to the fun. Plus, Simon Yuen as the old master was never better.

775496,5,630406182X,"The young Jackie Chan was indeed something to behold. Full of fresh ideas and vigour, his hard work and sacrifice never failed to rub off on the viewer. And although he still has enough star power to pack a cinema anywhere in the world, few of his films since the mid-eighties have engaged audiences as much as the ones that rocketed him to stardom. The Drunken Master is one of those films.

Directed by HK film legend Yuen Woo Ping (The Matrix, Kill Bill and so on...), The Drunken Master is Packed with the kind of balls-to-the-wall, take no prisoners action that could bring the dead back to life. In fact the action is so good, it completely supersedes the films typical, cookie-cutter plot. Don't get me wrong, the plot exists. It's there, and it's valid enough, (Jackie plays a mischevious kid/Kung fu master who gets his ass kicked in a fight and so goes on to learn a new secret technique from a wheezy old man) but the whole thing stuffed so tightly with Jackie's unique brand of action/physical comedy, you won't notice it. The fight scenes in this film are superb, carried out with the hectic energy of a kid with something big to prove. Jackie pulls off moves that defy the laws of gravity one after the other, and all the while looking like he's put away half a keg of Australian beer.

I could go on all day, but I won't. You'll have to see it, Not just to love it, but to beleive it. For genre freaks like me it was great for the fighting, for everyone else, watch it just to see what action should be. Minus the budget, minus the egos and minus the CGI, the films star and the film itself are full to the brim with raw talent and innovation.

I'm told in their native country, these simple storylines were churned out almost weekly and all pretty much follow the same formula. Similar to Saturday morning cowboy movies from days gone by, for Western audiences. The fact that Jackie has appeared in over 90 pictures, probably supports that fact. Here Jackie becomes student to a wisened old beggar who happens to be an expert exponent of ""Drunken Boxing"" and dutifully teaches Mr Chan, after he is helped by him. Jackie's love of Buster Keaton action slapstick, combined with the almost superhuman acrobat skills he acquired with the Peking Opera from a young age, blend masterfully, and the movie has plenty of humour as well as action. The fight scenes and stunts, are superbly executed (as usual)and the arduos training regime Jackie must endure, is both comical and revealing. Like so many Kung Fu style pictures of the era, this film sufferes terribly from bad dubbing, and is actually better watched in it's original form with subtitles. At 10 mins short of 2 hours is not that lean, but bounces along from scene to scene without making you worry too much. 16 years before the more widely known Legend of Drunken Master in 1994, this is still a great comic/action martial arts flick, and although it may not be as polished as his more recent work, the raw energy and exuberence of a more youthful Mr Chan, make this a must for fans and collectors alike.

775540,3,630406182X,"DRUNKEN MASTER is one of Jackie Chan's all time greats (the film itself is a 5 star film, only this DVD gets a 3 star rating).  He plays a naughty little rascal named Huang Fei Hung (yes, the same character Kwan Tak Hing made famous in a series of nearly 100 films and later by Jet Li in the ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA series of films) who's sent by his father to the famous Sam the Seed (the old Drunken Master himself, Simon Yuen) to learn discipline.  Huang Fei Hung can't take the torturous training and runs away, but after getting beat up and humiliated by a wicked kicking Master (he burns the kid's pants, badmouths his father's kung fu, and makes him crawl between his legs like a dog) he quickly repents and begs Sam the Seed to take him back.  The film is a delightful mixture of kung fu, comedy, and drama with enough dazzling displays of martial arts and acrobatics to keep viewing fresh time after time.
My gripe with this DVD is that the English language track is NOT the wonderfully fun one released previously on VHS featuring those loveably familiar English dubbed kung fu movie voices of the 1970s-80s.  Some people hate those English dub jobs and will always prefer the original Chinese language tracks (which fortunately ARE on the DVD with choice of subtitles), but there are those of us who also enjoy watching the old English dubbed versions for their sheer camp value and cartoon-like energy.  Those same voices (found on almost all exported kung fu films of that time period) have become like family members (the ones you want to have visit!).  The voice actors then may have switched roles from picture to picture, not ALWAYS voicing the same onscreen actors as you saw and heard them do before, and they may not have been of Royal Shakespeare Company standard, but they always brought with them a smile of recognition and often livened up otherwise dull proceedings.
Some simply don't like English dubs.  ""The words don't match their mouths and it's always the same voices!""  Well, guess what?  That's the case even in the original language.  The Chinese tracks are almost always dubbed in afterwards by actors other than the ones onscreen.  Sure they may come a little closer to matching the lips since the actors words are closer to the words dubbed in later, and some of the voice artists may be familiar with and try to sound similar to the real actor, but it's still nowhere near to perfect lip-synching.  Even when the audio is recorded live in synch-sound, the English subtitles still differ from the actual words spoken due to the complex nature of translation (and by golly, what do you do if you're eating, and don't catch all the words during the dialogue driven portions of the film while you're looking at your plate?).
For myself, I will admit that there IS something about original language tracks and subtitles that DOES work better for the more serious pictures as they lend a kind of authenticity and intelligence to the viewing experience (after all we are forced to READ during them which IS a scolarly endeavor, isn't it?), but for the comedy laden kung fu flicks of the 70s and 80s it's nice sometimes to just sit back and relax to the goofy sounds of the old English dubs.  The voice-over actors of HK films of the 90s and today just don't cut the mustard.  Most sound like second rate actors trying to sound like first rate actors, the result being a bore.  The old dubbers may have been third rate actors, but at least they were having fun and the voices they chose matched the pictures.  There's nothing more enjoyable, or appropriatly matching in sound and sight, than the old voices used for the weasel characters of Dean Shek or the interpreter found in FISTS OF FURY (aka THE CHINESE CONNECTION).  Back then the villains sounded like creeps, the good guys sounded like heroes, the rascals sounded like wiseguys, and the big guys sounded like Bullwinkle!
After all of that then, this DVD release of DRUNKEN MASTER does NOT feature the original English dub and its loveable voices of the 70s.  It has a newer, unimproved English track, and quite a bit of the dialogue is different as well.  The English dub here is simply NO FUN.  Maybe whoever redid the track wanted it to sound less cartoon-like and more natural, but you can't voice a comedy using serious voices that don't match the comedic energy of the performers onscreen!  The old crew had that energy (and even the times that they lacked it was fun, too, because when they lacked it back then, boy, they REALLY lacked it!).  The remastered DVDs of SNAKE AND CRANE ARTS OF SHAOLIN, FEARLESS HYENA, and DRAGON FIST all contain those wonderfully voiced original English dubs (as well as the original Cantonese or Mandarin track depending on the film).  Why was DRUNKEN MASTER, one of the GREATEST kung fu movies ever, not treated the same?  Were they trying to give it a new respect after the success of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON?  They should have realized that DRUNKEN MASTER already HAS respect here, and in part because of the wonderful sense of fun found in the original English dub.  I wish those old actors would get more credit for bringing such wonderfully guilty pleasure to so many fans.

Oh, and for those wanting to know more about the film itself, it contains Simon Yuen's defining performance as the charismatic old Drunken Master, Yuen Wo Ping's masterful direction using action and comedy to propel the story along, one of Hwang Jang Lee's most villainous performances and some of the greatest kicking abilities ever displayed onscreen, and a young Jackie Chan's complete devotion to character, pushing his body and comedic talents to the limits.

775545,4,630406182X,"Quite possibly the most important Kung-Fu comedy of all time, Drunken Master sealed Jackie Chan's super-stardom in history forever. In the film, it's quite obvious that he had much more freedom and control over the creative aspects, mainly in the character he played (a very different version of the much revered Chinese hero Wong Fei-Hung) and the Kung-Fu choreography itself. With him and director Yuen Woo Ping being very young at the time, they really let the creative juices flow.
The DVD itself is quite impressive. The picture is incredibly clear and sharp, by far the greatest version of the film available in North America. Columbia Tri-Star must've recognized the overall value of the film, and thus decided to leave it uncut. The extras are pretty decent as well, although they're no where near as good as those available in the European HK Legends series DVDs.
Now onto an aspect that many people have found rather bothersome. The DVD comes with both Cantonese and English soundtracks, with a list of subtitles as far as the eye can see. The English dubbing is actually rather charming, with the camp level just good enough to appreciate. Fei-Hung and Sam Seed are both memorable characters in the film, and thank God that the dubbing didn't ruin the atmosphere. The Cantonese track on the other hand, is quite poor. The music and voices have a scratchy quality to them. But the worse part is that the track is incomplete.

Most probably due to the poor conservation of HK films, Columbia Tri-Star has tried their best to gives us a complete experience.

Drunken Master is a million times better than all of those films put together.

I'm not going to explain the plot and such. This was a great film with great action scenes and a lot of funny moments. The audio commentary is also a nice touch. BUT, why two stars you ask? Here's the problem:
The Chinese track switches from Chinese to English across different chapters. I thought it was my player but then I tried other players and the same problem arose. Then after reading the following reviews on Amazon, this was the manufacturer's fault! I can't believe it! I've had the VCD for years and I loved the film.

They didn't even do anything to enhance it, so it looks just like the cheesy 70's flick it is. The fight scenes are cool at times, but they are very long, as is the whole movie. It's not exactly the most exciting martial arts movie I have ever seen either.
A very young Jackie Chan plays a karate student with lots of talent, but also a lot of laziness and a tendency to misbehave. His angry instructors sentence him to training with and old man who has earned a reputation for being cruel and injuring his students. Jackie Chan tries to escape, but to no avail. After much ineffectual hassling with this old man, Jackie agrees to let him teach him the art of Drunken Boxing. It is a culmination of styles taken from eight different gods, which can only be done when - you guessed it - drunk. Jackie, however, refuses to learn the style of the eighth god because she is a woman, which later turns out to be a bad move. (He does, however, make a good ladylike impression of her :) that was one of the funny parts) He gets in a lot of fights along the way and in the end winds up fighting for his father's honor.

The men are very interesting and offer a lot of information on the specifics of ""Drunken Master"", Jackie Chan, and Hong Kong action films as well. This commentary and the one on ""Once Upon A Time In China"" are two of the most interesting I've heard when it comes to learning the history of H.K. films. As a novice on Hong Kong action cinema, I appreciate that we not only get to see these essential films but to hear the back story as to their making. I do wish that all of the great titles that came out from American companies showed the proper care when it came to preserving their original running times without edits or dubbed tracks (Disney, I'm talking to you) but hopefully in time we can get the respect Hong Kong films deserve and get if nothing else, decent DVD editions of films like those of Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and the countless other H.K. figures that we admire.",1019779200,2,1781,4.432926829268292

But seriously, 5 minutes of English dialogue doesnt ruin the whole movie.

In fact, the first 25 minutes of the movie are back-to-back fight scenes.  But the action doesn't let up, and following scenes only get better.
Young Jackie Chan's abilities are simply amazing.  His acrobatic and martial arts skills are incredible.  Many sequences of moves and flips are done in one take and all without wires.

Concerning the film itself, this is among the best kung-fu films I have seen. Unlike many more current kung-fu flicks, the plot is simple and there are no unnecessary ""save the world"" twists.

Yes, so apparently the Cantonese track was damaged in Columbia's prints.  It wasn't on the VHS rental I happened to find in a small shop in Chicago two years ago.  Why couldn't Columbia purchase the rights to cannibalize at least some of the sound from a VHS version?  (Not sure if any of the original footage left off VHS versions was damaged).

The fighting is not violent and is blended with plenty of fun and creativity. The part that the beggar plays with Jackie Chan in the wood is one of my favourite scene of the movie. It is amazing that the beggar can play with Jackie's body in so many ways you can hardly fancy.
It is one of Yuan Wooping's early works. The fighting has changed so much over the years (Drunken Master II (Jackie Chan's 1994 work) is a modern Kung Fu movie, watch that for to see the difference). But there is no wire work, no special effects. The actors actually did everything you see. If you can think of how much effort it takes to design and practise so many fighting scenes before they are ready to be shot, yet every scene is still so full of imagination, you will truly appreciate this movie as a classic.",1005436800,,1202,4.299559471365638

While the fight scenes are spectacular and well staged (an average of a fight every 5-10 minutes), the big disappointment in the is the quality of the transfer to DVD.  The picture is blurry at times.  Another disappointment is the sound. It is dubbed with very poor quality.  Ironically it was very similar to the Kung Fu movies they used to show on television years ago, the very ones that made me a big fan of the genre.  It was a trip down memory lane.

He plays Wong Fei-hong, the son of a chinese herbalist who has a propensity for the bottle. Chan pulls out the Drunken Boxing with the sort of physically comedic prowess that's earned him the respect of critics worldwide and is usually compared to classic actors like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Dubbed in English, the dialogue comes off pretty well and the jokes are solid throughout (especially from his mother, played with outrageous energy by Anita Mui). The final fight scene is breathtaking and the outtakes during the credits remind you that Chan does this all himself. If you ever enjoyed an action flick, don't miss this one.",976492800,4,740,4.928

First the big tough guy who you never see in the movie. THan theres the steel mill workers than the best for last those 2 badasses... The end fight scene is 20 mins! And not even a second was bad. I especially liked the guy with the glasses and the freakin wicked and fast legs. Maybe sped up? but oh well. THat is Jackie CHan's real life bodyguard if you didn't know. He was in Who Am I(the guy who said he was from korea) and Gorgeous look for him, I don't nkow about any other movies. WEll this movie was overral not boring, stupid, or lame in anyways.
