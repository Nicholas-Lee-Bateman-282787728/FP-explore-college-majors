8245175,1,B0012DT2U8,"Incomplete DVD.  No travel in the Ticino, the Italian=speaking canton; nothing about Graubunden.  Nothing about the religions of the canton.  No photos of church or cathedral interiors.  Superficial DVD.  It should be removed from Amazon's catalog.",1361836800,,248,5.777777777777778
