2679471,5,B000JUBF3W,"This is a beautiful film. Unfortunately it is marred somewhat by the narrator's glaring misprounuciation of key place names like ""Angkor"" which he persists in calling ""angor"" despite the fact that some of the experts featured pronounce it correctly. He also calls the temple Banteay Srei something like ""Banteay Serei, which has a completely different meaning in Khmer. In addition, he makes a glaring error in his pronounciation of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta town My Tho, as most foreigners do. It would have been quite simple to check and correct these errors prior to release of the film and one has to wonder why such an apparently professional producer did not bother to do this. I still recommend the film highly, in part because there are no real alternative choices for those interested in Cambodia and the Mekong Delta.",1176336000,8,829,4.971223021582734
2679472,5,B000JUBF3W,"The title of this seems to be a blend of John Swaine's River of Time and The Churning of the Ocean of Milk, a Hindu myth depicted in bas-relief in a gallery of Angkor Wat. This is a very interesting travelogue, with the Mekong as its focus, strating the journey in Vietnamese delta and progressing to Cambodia. There are interviews with ruin restorers in the Angkor Thom complex as well as shots of the rare Mekong dolphin around Kratie. There are constant references to Copplola's Apocalypse Now but this does not detract from the narrative. An excellent DVD.",1174780800,9,560,4.724489795918367
2679473,5,B000JUBF3W,The cinematography in this video is exceptional. The history and richness of this area is very powerful. I highly recommend this video for anyone going to visit Cambodia and Vietnam or has interest in the history of this area. Excellent!!,1163116800,10,238,4.975
8153211,5,B000JUBF3W,Fantastic river voyage from Vietnam to Cambodia.  We're preparing for the same trip this fall.  The DVD prepares us for the trip up the river and our tour of Angkor Wat !  Couldn't be happier.,1439769600,,192,4.428571428571429

8153215,4,B000JUBF3W,"A good way to see the Mekong River, however it did not have closed caption, so could not give it a better rating.",1385596800,,113,3.9565217391304346
8153216,4,B000JUBF3W,"I bought this for my daughter, who, despite being only 20 years old, made a trip to Cambodia and Vietnam by herself several years ago.  You will probably find the $19.95 cost to be worth this beautifully filmed travelogue.  The trip starts in My Tho, a Vietnamese city just inland from the mouth of the Mekong Delta, but I didn't get my bearings because I never saw the city.  From there the trip moves rapidly towards Vietnam and into Cambodia, rarely pausing, until you approach the border with Cambodia.  During this leg of the trip at times I felt cast adrift, not knowing where along the river I was.  Once into the Cambodia the Mekong seems to become murky and a pall seems to hang in the air.  I felt as if this was a trick being played by the filmmaker in order to make a point of the differences one will experience when crossing the border.  At times I wished to be able to just watch the scenery and not be intruded on by constant narration.  (One narrator was an attractive Swiss woman named Simone Kauffman, who, interestingly, seemed to speak English with an Asian accent.)  I was left wanting more time on the water and less time in the temples of Angkor, where the film lingers overlong.  However, the film is about a trip to Angkor; I just wanted to spend more time on the journey.",1203724800,2,1298,4.415966386554622
8153217,5,B000JUBF3W,"This is as close as most of us will ever get to the Mekong River and the magnificant ancient ruins in the heart of Cambodia, Angkor Wat.  The journey is beautiful and poignant, referring to the sad war history of the area and the friendliness of the very rural people there today, who are described as just glad not to be afraid anymore.  I was surprised how huge the river is.  There are photos of the 600-lb catfish who live in it, and the filmmakers were very fortunate to have captured some footage of the fresh-water dolphins, which are almost extinct.

Angkor Wat is one of the great wonders of the world, a very large and complex ruin, with beautiful carvings in the stone of the buildings.  The video shows them well.  I would not have minded more concentration on, and closeups of, the carvings and more about their meaning.",1198195200,,833,4.52
8153218,2,B000JUBF3W,"The DVD skips... for starters.
An initial nice, narrative journey turns into a showcase for two effete snobs who 'lord over' what should be a pleasant excursion.  Also, the DVD does not begin in Saigon, but distal from there.  I have been to Saigon...and the Mekong.  This is a major disappointment.
Seek something better.",1189382400,3,322,4.925925925925926
