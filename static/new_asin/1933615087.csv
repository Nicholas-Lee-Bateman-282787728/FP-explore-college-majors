7801804,5,1933615087,"Folks doing what they know how to do - it doesn't get any better than this.  I like that nothing is absurd or trendy.... no stirring TRUFFLE OIL into everything or insisting that EVERY GREEN VEGETABLE IS KALE.  I've pretty much got all the DVDs now, and it is just good to wile away a rainy day making stock and letting them roll!",1366156800,,330,4.222222222222222
7801805,5,1933615087,"The shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing, but that is just a personal preference.

[Note: There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.  Also, there seem to be parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did.]

I have copies of all seasons and I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,5,1055,4.5
7801806,5,1933615087,I borrowed this from the library and liked it so much I bought it. The recipes turn out perfect and the reviews are very helpful. This season covers a lot of classics and comfort food and basic techniques that even a 'well seasoned' cook will learn from. I highly recommend Season 6.,1229817600,3,283,4.461538461538462
7801807,1,1933615087,I purchased the 2006 ATK tapes and was automatically enrolled in the ATK book club with no way to opt out their progam.  I started receiving unordered and unwanted ATK books in the mail and billed for same. Involuntarily enrolling customers in their ATK book club seems like a rather shady practice for a supposedly reputable testing lab.,1209254400,8,338,4.827586206896552
7801808,4,1933615087,I'm not sure I agree with some of ATK's recipes and I have different opinions on the product reviews but I really enjoy watching this show.  The current season of dvds are offered with a purchase of the cookbook through Cook's Illustrated directly.  Although I have watched grainy episodes on tv.  I am tempted to get this because of their simple paella recipe that I plan on finishing in a ten cup rice cooker.,1173139200,6,411,4.527027027027027
