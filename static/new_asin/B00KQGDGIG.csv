6440396,5,B00KQGDGIG,A continuation of the development of a private-eye team with desires for a life for fulfilling personal desires.,1411862400,2,112,5.277777777777778
6440397,3,B00KQGDGIG,I loved seeing all of New Orleans in this movie.  This movie is pretty cheesy but its what I expected.,1410652800,3,102,4.1
6440398,1,B00KQGDGIG,"I am not sure who this CAT is who gave this 3 stars, but this movie absolutely sucked! After seeing the first film, I was so looking forward to a second. When I noticed some of the key characters were not involved, I should have run! People, do not waste your money or time!  One of the worst choices I have ever made looking for a movie to watch!  Stay clear!",1409702400,3,360,4.056338028169014
6440399,3,B00KQGDGIG,"This film starts out similar to the first film. Strippers entertain at an Army Research Base and download some classified material. Our main characters are inadequately introduced and assumes you have seen the first film...which BTW I loved. The action moves to N' Orleans and attempts to capture much of the local flavor through a cooking contest and subscripts.

The subscripts was an idea stolen from ""Airplane!"" The original film had great characters who helped carry the film. D.L. Hughley and Janet McTeer added a comic element in the original.. Paz Vega in the first film totally smokes Winter Ave Zoli with her sensuality.

The second feature was a let down and could have been a lot better. This was an inferior script. 2 1/2 stars

6440400,5,B00KQGDGIG,"Better then the ""First"" one! It shouldn't be called Number 2 because it's actually same movie story line like the original but more edgy! Excellent entertainment!",1428796800,3,162,5.269230769230769
6440401,5,B00KQGDGIG,not as good as the first but still decent,1427500800,,41,3.6666666666666665
6440402,4,B00KQGDGIG,"Not really a sequel to the original ""Cat Run"", but it was interesting enough to keep my attention. I liked it, but not nearly as much as the original. The movie opens with full frontal nudity, but this does not continue in the rest of the movie. Not for children, for sure, but OK for adults.",1425859200,6,292,4.232142857142857

6440404,2,B00KQGDGIG,"Not as good or funny as the first movie.  if the first one was somewhat interesting, this one will be horrible.",1419206400,2,111,4.285714285714286
6440405,5,B00KQGDGIG,Even better than the first!,1415750400,,27,4.6
6440406,4,B00KQGDGIG,"Terrible movie.  Well worth watching if you enjoyed (or even tolerated) the first movie.

Not quite as much torture porn.  They couldn't afford a steadycam and the camera guy had palsy.  Lots of nudity to open it up.  Lots of humor and jokes.  A little more surreal too.",1415145600,,270,4.520833333333333
6440407,2,B00KQGDGIG,"Bias Alert! I really don't like action comedies so that is one strike against this film already. Secondly, I do have the original Cat Run but I made the mistake of thinking the action in this Cat Run 2 would equal the first. I do not find this film funny in the least. The storyline is terrible and has little relationship to the original except that the stars are still calling themselves private detectives. I will not be getting Cat Run 3 if they make one.",1414454400,,459,4.348837209302325
