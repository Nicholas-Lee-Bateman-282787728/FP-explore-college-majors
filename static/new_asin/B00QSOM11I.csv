6878652,5,B00QSOM11I,"actually much better than i expected...my dad grew up in oakland and worked in the valley when he was in college, as did i in 1973...we started going as a family when i was 3 yrs old and my love has only grown since then... i hung out a little in camp 4 in 1973 and knew a few of the guys, although none who became famous...i have been there many times since and consider it almost a 2nd home...i was expected to be underwhelmed by the climber-bro storyline and didn't expect the scenery to be appropriately represented...but i was wrong...the photography was fabulous and the storyline was indeed interesting to me...i have watched it twice already.",1466985600,,650,4.564102564102564

8692689,5,B00QSOM11I,"Recommended by a friend that hikes a lot around the US, and I am just a casual walker , I watched it on Netflix, and was so fascinated with it that I purchased it here on Amazon, how there are people out there that go through and challenge themselves in these cliff and mountain climbing trips is mind boggling, it is definitely not for everyone or faint at heart, but most interesting to see how these people accomplish these tasks , especially through this timeline documentary from the 50's to modern days, I enjoyed the 70's part of it most , having being a former hippy during my day , could not believe the drinking and drugs being done and still doing these dangerous climbs.",1500163200,,682,4.464
