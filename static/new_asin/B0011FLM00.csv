3064557,4,B0011FLM00,"I have to believe that ""Hatchet"" is a parody. No one in their right mind could have believed that a film so ridiculous could ever be taken seriously; everything about it is consistently hokey, from the acting to the plot to the dialogue to the sense of humor to the abundant horror movie clichs. It had to be intentional for this movie to be so bad. Because I believe this to be true, I'll take a risk--a really big risk--and give it four stars. I say this because it's either one of the worst slasher films ever made, or it's a clever satire that knew how to point at itself and laugh. I'd like to think that it falls under the latter category. Given the content, I find it impossible to believe that the filmmakers actually wanted to make a reputable movie. Consider cameo appearances by Tony ""Candyman"" Todd and Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund, and keep in mind that the killer is played by Kane ""Jason Voorhees"" Hodder. Has my point been made clear?

Make no mistake--a definite case can be made for how genuinely bad ""Hatchet"" is. In no way is it believable, intelligent, or even remotely original. The thing is, I think that was the idea all along: it exists on the same mindless level that made early teen slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" so popular. It's all about idiotic people wandering into idiotic situations and dying in idiotic ways. We get gory makeup effects that are anything but special. We get the usual gathering of mismatched, annoying characters. We get the sex-crazed side characters. We get naked breasts. And yes, we get the hideously deformed monster wielding various weapons, including a hatchet. No thought is required for this film, and in that sense, it works.

In what's clearly paying homage to the horror films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, ""Hatchet"" tells the story of a tour gone wrong in the remote swamps of New Orleans. Hoping to escape the furor of Mardi Gras and reminders of his ex-girlfriend, college student Ben (Joel David Moore) decides to go on a Haunted Swamp tour. Joining him is his friend, Marcus (Deon Richmond), a.k.a., the sex-crazed side character. Along the way, they meet a perverted cameraman (Joel Murray), a ridiculously wholesome older couple (Richard Riehle and Patrika Darbo), and a pair of quarreling bimbos (Joleigh Fioreavanti and Mercedes McNab) who regularly expose their chests for the cameraman. One of them is blonde; I make note of that because, as the stereotype suggests, she's an absolute moron.

Leading the tour is a phony voodoo shop owner (Parry Shen), a man who, as Marcus aptly remarks, ""is like Uncle Remus meets Bruce Lee."" He clearly has no idea what he's doing; not only does he board everyone on a ramshackle motorboat with a rusty engine, he also has to rely on index cards for vital bits of information. What kind of information, you ask? How about the legend of Victor Crowley? Crowley, who was born deformed, lived with his father in the middle of the swamp, avoiding the world as much as he could. On a Halloween night many years ago, a group of teenagers tried to scare Crowley outside by throwing firecrackers at his house. They only succeeded in burning it. Mr. Crowley tried but failed to save his son, and he later died of heartbreak. It was soon established that the swamp was haunted, and it's remained so ever since; they say that, if you listen carefully, you can still hear the ghost of Crowley calling for his father....

And that's pretty much when the bodies start piling up. Has the ghost of Victor Crowley come back for revenge? Did he even die in the fire? Do these questions matter? Anyone familiar with the conventions of slasher films will know exactly what to expect from ""Hatchet,"" which can be viewed in one of two ways: this movie is either a rehash of a rehash of a rehash, or it's trying to poke fun at the genre it stems from. I prefer the second viewpoint because I just know this film is supposed to be an inside joke. This is especially true of Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), a character of mixed horror movie personality types--she's the Bold Heroine, the Girl with a Secret, and the Distant But Reachable Love Interest all rolled into one. She joined the tour only to find her father and brother, who went missing when alligator hunting in the swamp. When Crowley begins killing, her knowledge of the legend makes her the leader of the remaining group. And as you might have guessed, Ben finds her attractive.

If this were any other movie, namely a serious movie, it would no doubt be one of the worst of recent memory. As a parody, it at least informs the audience of what it wants to accomplish, and it does so fairly early on. It would be easy--too easy--to condemn ""Hatchet"" for being predictable, derivative, disgusting, and of poor quality. But a film this unabashedly tasteless should be given some credit. This movie is not frightening by any means, and the filmmakers must have known that all along. It's bad because I think it chooses to be, and that allows us to have a good time watching it. If a film of depth and complexity is what you're looking for ... but no, you're not. If you were, I seriously doubt you would have bothered to read this review.",1191542400,13,5191,4.631921824104235
3064558,5,B0011FLM00,"This is a cult classic.

3064585,1,B0011FLM00,"This Movie is So Fake, I'm a big fan of Horror Movies but this Doesn't cut it! So many Problems",1506470400,,95,3.8
3064586,5,B0011FLM00,"I will admit that before I saw this movie for the very first time, I regret that I only knew the existence of this movie because I saw it on the shelves of every video store that I went to back when this movie wasn't that old.  I also watched this entirely blindly as I had never seen a single preview nor had I read anything about this movie prior to having seen it.  In so many ways this movie blew me away from start to finish.

The story/plot for the uninitiated:  The movie focuses on a group of college buddies going to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras.  Of them is our main character Ben(Joel David Moore, Avatar, Spiral) and his best friend Marcus(Deon Richmond, Not Another Teen Movie, Kenny aka BUD from tv's The Cosby Show).  Ben went with his friends to New Orleans so that he could have some fun while getting over his recent break up with his girlfriend of 8 years.  Once Ben finds that he just can't seem to get over his break up and thus can't seem to enjoy Mardi Gras, Ben tells Marcus that he had been told of a late night swamp tour by some friends.  Marcus hesitant at first to join Ben eventually agrees to and after some walking they first try to get a night swamp tour from Rev. Zombie(the Final Destination series, the Candyman trilogy).  Unfortunately due to an accident and a lawsuit, Rev. Zombie could no longer do night tours.  Rev. Zombie then tells Ben and Marcus about them another place to go.  As soon as they get there they soon meet the owner and tour guide Shawn.  After ignoring any warnings from crazy fisherman Jack Cracker, the group soldiers on down the swamp.  Once the boat breaks on a rock, they all find that they have much bigger problems than alligators and swamp gases as people from the tour group start disappearing mysteriously.

In this movie you meet some colorful characters that ride the boat swamp tour along with Ben and Marcus:
-First there's Shawn the highly charismatic Asian tour guide with a Cajun accent and alot of wit.
-Doug Shapiro a freelance porn director.
-Misty and Jenna 2 gorgeous and very sexy porn stars that work for Mr. Shapiro.
-Jim and Shannon a good two shoes elderly married couple from Minnesota.
- Finally:Marybeth a beautiful yet decidedly less-than-social, highly mysterious, and terribly crabby young woman.

The cinematography in this movie is beautiful and well shot.  While the night shots are a little bit hard to make out, overall there are plenty of well lit night shots to be enjoyed.

The kill scenes are beautifully executed heralding back to anything awesome that Savini or Baker would have created.  By that I mean that the old school gore is very impressive and still manages to look amazingly realistic.  Also that the limitless ways that people are killed is just astounding.

The chase scenes are both scary and highly riveting keeping you guessing as to who will make it and who will be butchered.

The music proved catchy and playful at times and seriously dark and wicked other times.

The nudity was plenty(partly thanks to the Mardi Gras scenes) and showcased some gorgeous bodies as all get out.

Victor Crowley is freakishly ugly, freaky, menacing, violent and murderous without any reservations or conscience, and just like so many slasher serial killers before him proves close to impossible to stop and to kill.  That is most everything that we have all come to expect from a slasher icon.

The humor is silly camp is also very welcome and enjoyable.  Deon ""Kenny"" Richmond(Marcus) and Parry Shen(Shawn) both bring the hilarity and silliness full circle. Mercedes McNab(Misty) proves gorgeous, smokin' hot, and yes funny with her ditzy one-liners and neurotic reactions to things.  Also there is an occasional bit of hilarious banter between Joel David Moore(Ben) and Deon Richmond.  Other than that Robert Englund and Joshua Leonard both have hysterically funny cameos.

All in all, if you love a good slasher, like I do, don't mind rough and graphic scenes of gore, love well crafted and realistic practical gore, love good jokes to take the edge off and lighten things up some, enjoy campy yet fun stereotypes, enjoy great female nudity, want to see a somewhat different kind of killer, love great shots of New Orleans and swampy lands, and above want some shocking scares, then this movie totally has you in mind.  A must see!!!  10 stars out of 10!!!",1506297600,,4368,4.707894736842105

I had a smile almost all the way through and lol'ed a few times. It's definitely hitting more of the comedy side of the house rather than any real horror scare tactics. The acting was very good, surprisingly. The chemistry between the entire cast REALLY just worked. The black guy and white guy stereotype wasn't really there (good thing). If anything the black guy really stole a lot of the scenes...he needs more roles! Him and the brunette were great together.
Anyway, a really fun movie, great dialogue and cast ( an Asian Cajun tour guide..love it!)",1504224000,,703,4.818181818181818

3064641,3,B0011FLM00,"When you get a movie called ""Hatchet"" I am pretty sure you know what you are in for, if not, you made a boo-boo. Standard but a little more fun type of movie to see how many people we can kill in 84 minutes. Once you see the characters (stock types all) you can figure out who goes when. Not really any likable characters at all but still has fun, seems likes the budget was the same as my last supermarket trip. Don't get me wrong I stayed through the whole thing and was somewhat entertained. But as always the same survivors always happen. So lost points for that typical crap.

3064643,5,B0011FLM00,Great movie. A lot of gory action. It's an awesome slasher film.,1458691200,,64,4.416666666666667
3064644,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet makes no apologies about what it is. Ever self-aware, the movie is advertised as ""Old-school American horror"" and that's more or less what you get. Hatchet is obviously  going for a retro '80s slasher film feel, complete with your quintessential disfigured villain, gore and bad acting. A lot of it has been done: its swamp setting, the deformed villain, but it's fine, Hatchet embraces it all. Besides, what else could you have possibly expected?

You know you're in for some legit old-school horror when your cast features Kane Hodder as the main villain and an appearance by Robert Englund no less. I loved the first sequence starring the ever reliable Englund, it gives the story a strong setting and it's great to see him on our screens again.

One of the best sequences of Hatchet is without a doubt the retelling of Victor Crowley's backstory. I know, it's not very original, but it's effective and gives off a classic vibe. It has the makings of one of the great horror icons and would make Jason Vorhees proud.

In a nutshell, Victor Crowley was born grossly deformed as a child. This leads to his dad to keep him under lock and key shielding him away from other children. In a Halloween prank gone wrong, Crowley is accidentally killed and now he haunts the swamps where he died. Crowley's story is interesting, and although somewhat reminiscent of other horror films and borrows from Friday the 13's, it stand strong enough on it's own.

The story? Ahh! of course, a few individuals think it's a good idea to go on a haunted tour where legends of Crowley are whispered... And you can probably figure out the rest of the story.

The character of Victor Crowley is a good old classic, pissed-off villain. Kane Hodder has proven himself time after time and in Hatchet he shines once more, playing to perfection the part of the mammoth and nightmare of a man that is Crowley.

I can't say the same of the other characters and their largely forgettable stories. Hatchet abides largely by horror stereotypes: the sweet old couple, the crook, the two dumb wannabe porn-actress, the strong female, the scared/funny black guy.

The kills are solid and would've been right at home in a '80s Slasher flick, which is what they intended and were going for. The death scenes are not overly clich'd and some  are very creative -at least in comparison to modern horror- others are rather to the point and very effective.

I won't spoil it but I thought Hatchet ended a little abruptly. The ending was little lacking and unsatisfying, it certainly could have ended on a higher note. Otherwise, if you're looking for a fun retro '80s slash-fest and some old-school horror you could do worse.

I remember a lot of hype around this film upon it's release. It doesn't quite live up to the hype as Hatchet fails to be all it tries to be, but it keeps you entertained and managed two sequels. The character of Victor Crowley, his story and the gore are top notch, it's the rest that's not quite up to par. Not a terrible movie, in many ways it's decent horror. Just don't expect too much. 3 & 1/2 stars.",1457049600,,3099,4.6471663619744055

The lighting  was unimaginative illuminating almost the entire set in what is supposed to be a densely wooded swamp.  They show the killer fully lighted, full body the very first time he appears.  This is a sloppy homage, but I could've been okay with it if the film had any kind of ending.  I mean show bodies dropping and a boat rowing away...anything really.

3064771,4,B0011FLM00,"Ok let me start by saying that when i first saw this movie i didn't think it was that great,but then my buddy hooked me up with Hatchet 2 and the story seemed to get really interesting & deeper than what we get told in the first movie. So that being said i re-watched the first Hatchet,and i was impressed.
Okay so the story is this,some people in NOLA were looking to kill some time,and seeings how Mardi Gras wasn't doing the trick for the head guy in the movie(i forget his damn name,but you get introduced to him in the beginning with his friends on Bourbon St.)
So they go tooling around and they get deep into the NOLA streets,then come across Reverend Zombie's house of horror(played by Tony Todd) and he tells em about a swamp tour. So they go to find the tour boat,with as random cast of expendable characters. The acting is a little shapeless when it comes to some of the acting by characters like the 2 strippers & that old guys wife(i really dig the work that the old guy does,i just forgot his name too)
They take a tourboat down to Victor Crowley's swamp......
Your asking ""who's Victor Crowley? Well he was that sub-human creature kid that lived in the swamp with his dad(played by none other than Kane Hodder & Kane Hodder plays the all grown up ghost monster that is Victor Crowley)in the beginning you meet Rob Englund & his son. Well they are hunting for alligators in the swamp because nobody is supposed to be in that swamp cuz they all know better. In town the legend of Voctor Crowley is that he lives in those swamps,so nobody goes there. Well Englund & son go down to get gators from an unscathed part of the swamp(mistake)and then the intro credits roll. Then you meet the guys who decided to take a trip down and get on the tour boat. Now lets get right into it,the toiur is a scam set up by Reverend Zombie(Tony Todd) to make cash. The tour boat slams into a bog and then they have to abandon ship and walk through the swamp to get to a road. Along the way they meet a fisherman saying go back go back,Victor Crowley. The tour guide cracks me up,he plays the same part in the 2nd movie. But he plays the tour guide's twin brother Justin(that kid is funny)So they all get killed pretty much,in a fast set em up & knock em down fashion. Once they know the killer is there he takes them all out simultaneously. The kills are pretty good in here(the kills are 10x more brutal in #2) but the head twist is sick,i dig when the old man and his wife get taken out. I think they are the best ones in the movie,but don't worry old man Cracker' gets it in the second movie. Along the movie there is a sublining that creates more depth in the second movie. So now you know the movie is a trilogy which is pretty cool because the story gets deeper and more eerie as they progress. There is a girl on the boat Marybeth who is searching for her father and brother who got taken out in the beginning of the movie,but at the end you'll see what i mean on how it just ends...
But the second movie picks up literally on that same frame that it ended on,and the story progresses into trilogy magic. This is their first attemp on the movie,solid introduction  and solid story,great gore and violence. 4/5*stars for me. Parts 2 & 3 of Hatchet are both 5 Star movies. I recommend them all to you.

3064772,1,B0011FLM00,"I feel like I've had ten bucks stolen from me. The build up for this movie was and is big. I didn't even finish it. It's an insult to all slasher fans. This movie is a huge was of time and money. Don't rent it, buy it or waste your time watching a even a free version of it.",1399248000,,274,3.6610169491525424
3064773,1,B0011FLM00,"You know that urban legend about the person who goes to a party and wakes up the next morning in a tub of ice with a kidney missing? Or the even cruder one about the college kid who wakes up every morning feeling...sore...and eventually discovers chloroform and Vaseline under his roommate's bed?

Multiply those feelings about ten times and that's what I experienced after watching HATCHET. This movie bills itself as ""classic American horror."" Well, I think the movie was made in America, so that part of the claim is probably true. Classic? In a sense, yes: Adam Green has created a classic -- a classic piece of s***. Horror? Absolutely. I was absolutely horrified that I squandered two hours of precious life watching this shovelful of flaming Bantha-poodoo. This movie SUCKS. It's TERRIBLE. In fact I'd rather watch two hours of gritty 8mm film featuring flies crawling over a dung-heap than see this again. And they made sequels!

HATCHET opens with a father-son team of bayou bumpkins foolishly deciding to go into a supposedly haunted stretch of swamp to go fishing. Haunted by whom, you ask? Why, Victor Crowley, of course; the resident deformed, undead maniac whose favorite weapon is not a hatchet at all but a belt-sander (evidently the Louisiana power company provides free service to run down shacks in the middle of the swamp, allowing Mr. Crowley to recharge his deadly home-improvement implements during his leisure hours). After the inevitable slaughter which follows, the movie shifts to a trio of college students in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. They decide to take a ""haunted boat tour"" occupied by the usual cast of horror-movie fodder, which, thanks to a badly-timed rainstorm, ends up stranding the boat in Mr. Crowley's neighborhood. I could keep going, but since you already know what's going to happen from then to the credits, why bother?

Adam Green deserves a certain unwelcome credit for this movie. He manages to assemble a group of horror vets which includes Robert Englund, Richard Riehle, Tony Todd, Mercedes McNabb and, of course, Kane Hodder...and make a film which does not contain a single frightening moment. There's gore, of course -- buckets of blood and eyeballs and torn-off jaws -- and numerous shots of McNabb's boobs, and the requisite flashbacks to the origin story of Crowely, and even a chase-scene through graveyard; but none of it works or even comes close to working, because Green evidently didn't know that he was making a horror film. In fact, he seems to have thought he was shooting an MTV-style rip-off of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER with a lot more gore and a lot s***tier writing (and Mercedes McNabb for street cred). But by constantly striving for cheap locker-room/Spring break type comedy, he annihilates all horror elements and turns the flick into a comedy gone soggy with Red Dye No. 5.

To make matters worse -- yes, it gets worse -- by attempting to resurrect the slasher movies of the 80s (or rip them off), Green has instead s*** upon their memory, making an unintentional satire of all the things that made ""don't go in the woods"" flicks scary in the first place. Whatever agenda this movie had, it failed miserably. It's as much a pastiche of F-13 type movies as SCREAM was, without any of the cleverness; it's as much a horror-comedy as BUFFY (the series) was, without any of the subtlety, character development or balance between horror and comedy. Part of me wonders whether the whole thing wasn't a colossal in-joke at the expense of all horror movies shot between 1979 and about 1993...and yet even as an in-joke it fails on a historic level.

HATCHET has exactly one virtue. It exists as a sort of unintentional blueprint of how NOT to make a horror film, a horror-omedy, or really, any type of movie at all. They ought to burn every copy of it save one, which should be shown once a year at film schools worldwide as a cautionary tale on the power of a terrible idea. The Crypt Keeper could drag his bony butt out of retirement and give a lecture beforehand, telling the hapless students that it was no use running, the doors of the theater have been locked!

The main reason for it is that, this movie basically follows the same premise as a couple of the Friday the 13th movies and I didn't like most of those. There are differences in structure and plot but a lot of the movie is the same.

The main thing that was good was the cast chemistry, they all acted, I felt, realisticlly (yet seterotyped) and when it came to it they were far more willing to take action then most slasher film casts. Also I like how this killer didn't seem to have a prefered style of killing, it used multiple weapons and appeared to be a combination of Jason and Michael (Jasons deforms and Michaels intellagence). Also the pace didn't feel slow.

3064781,3,B0011FLM00,"If nothing else, Hatchet is good for a healthy dose of laughter- and not because it's a terrible movie. On the contrary, what Hatchet lacks in the scare department it makes up for with comedy, and the end result is a not-half-bad film. The story is hokey, sometimes deliberately so, and the actors dramatize quite a bit, but most of the glaring ""flaws"" in Hatchet are intentional. The incredibly exaggerated gore is proof enough of this.

Some other pertinent information for potential viewers/purchasers:

1. The monster is not original and actually reminded me of the goon from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funhouse/dp/B00023P4SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funhouse</a>.
2. Don't bother watching Hatchet if you hate when main characters act really, really stupid, especially after danger strikes.
3. There's no sex, but there are plenty of boobs! (The film opens with a streetside view of Mardi Gras)
4. GORE. Exaggerated and ridiculous gore.

Writer/director Adam Green successfully brings us a spoofy horror that pays homage to the Gods of 80s slasher movies.  While only cusping the outright horror comedy (e.g., Shaun of the Dead) or the more twisted slapstick approach (a la Evil Dead 2 or Dead-Alive), the humor is frequent and undeniable and the epic hatchetry (yup, just made that word up--please feel free to spread it like wildfire!) deserves a blood-soaked grin of approval.  This reminds me more of the farcical approaches of Piranha 3D, The Hazing and Tucker and Dale vs Evil.

A group of mostly twenty-somethings take a trip to a much cleaner and far more sober-looking New Orleans than I've ever seen.  They decide to go on a haunted swamp tour (led by a horrendously accented Parry Shen; The Hazing/Dead Scared) and find themselves stranded in the wilderness.

Ben (Joel David Moore)is the more sincere character whom we expect to survive this movie.  He's interested in fellow tour-goer Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), who us suspiciously quiet and reclusive as if she's on the tour with very different, more serious motives than simply having a fun night.  She reveals that this swamp belongs to the horribly disfigured Victor Crowley and basically tells the other tour-goers Crowley's ""origin story.""  He looks like The Goonies' Sloth and teenage Jason Voorhees had a lovechild--pretty much like one of the Wrong Turn hillbillies--and he loves to kill.

Bringing us laughs and T n A, Doug (Joel Murray) is working on a low budget Girls Gone Wild: Girls of Mardi Gras video with two airheaded rivals Misty (Mercedes McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioravanti).  They're always reminding us they don't like each other by criticizing their on-camera performances.  ""Your woo is so not in the moment.""  ""Yeah, well your nipples are dumb!""

Once they find themselves in Victor Crowley's territory there's head-twisting, impalement, lower jaw-tearing, creative use of a grinder as dental equipment, loads of dismemberment, a bloody ""death sneeze"" to the face, diagonal torso cleaving (points for difficulty!), a gross case of mouth-to-mouth drooling and someone even gets hit in the head with a severed head; and the overall gore-slathered action comes at a very healthy pace.  Piles of rubber guts, limbs and organs being forcibly sundered and yanked from their bodies, and buckets of blood being flung in front of the camera all contribute to the fun of this movie.  Cameos by Robert Englund and Tony Todd round out the satisfaction for horror fans.  The sets and acting all seem a little fake, but not ""bad"" fake.  It all fits nicely with this more jesting approach to horror.

The killer (Kane Hodder) literally pops up out of nowhere between our victims mid-conversation like an over-sized hillbilly mutant ninja.  It's stupid as sin, but I laughed...after all, it was hilarious.  Clearly, this is a nod to 80s killers' legendary ability to vanish and then teleport the moment their victims' take their eyes off of them for even a second.

So I just finished watching Hatchet #1 to see if it was anything like II and it does share in its OTT (over the top) clich'e riddled with sexual, racial, ethnic, regional derogatory remarks and so on. The use of cheep special effects and lame kill scenes. Hatchet II did not seem to be quite as blatant, but not by much.
The concept of the story is ok, but the execution I can't begin to explain except to say they try everything in the book and then some. We have the standard horror story where the older people get killed first, then the perv, and then one of the cat fighting girls and the the dumb blonde or vise versa and last but not least we are left with the budding romance of the unrealistic couple to do battle.
The kill scenes are way over done and unrealistic and I think that they did this intentionally for laughs? Some of the humor was ok, but not good enough to make up for the rest of this movies problems.
The acting and dialogue is written'played to be corny and lame with clich'e driven innuendo that gets old fast. The actors do do a good job with what they have to work with and as they were directed.
If you are looking for a better budgeted horror flick with decent acting, but with bad OTT gore and a clich'e filled story that leaves nothing to your imagination or is the least bit scary then this might be what your looking for. 2.3 stars

This is a movie that relies on the shock factor and gruesome B movie special effects. It is so campy, it's funny. It is difficult to take this movie as a serious scary movie.

Although I rate it as a B movie, I would consider it a B+. During its time period, it was probably pretty awesome. However, today, I think it is probably seen in a much different perspective.

That being said, I did not like it very much. It did not keep my attention nor did I find the ""in your face"" blood and guts thrilling nor scary. 20 years ago, I may have rated this movie 4-5 stars.

As for the movie it's a cheesy horror flick that meant to be a cheesy horror flick. It has the action of a gory R rater film but the comedy and script of a PG13 movie. Some of the drawbacks to the movie are that it spends maybe the first 40-50 minutes creating the story and developing the characters and then the last 20-25 minutes is the killing spree. This is NOT a movie to be taken seriously So don't expect it to be serious.

The story of this film takes place in the swamps of Louisiana. Where a crazy deformed killer lurks looking to enact revenge on anyone he crosses. As a kid he was accidentally killed by his father who tried to save him from a group of boys that wanted to scare him. Now he has come back from the dead as a full grown man with a taste for vengeance Friday the 13th style. While carrying about his daily life of looking for people to kill he comes across a Swampland tour boat that gets stuck and that's where the movie starts (at least his part). The movie from there takes on a weird sort of Comedy/brutal horror movie type of theme. It's hard to describe because he comedic scenes are so corny the kill scenes are so over the top. It's not like Troma, or like Scream it's like Nickelodeon meets HBO late night cinema. If that sounded weird to you than you can guess how this movie was to watch. It will appeal to a certain kind of movie watcher. Who that is I don't really know. It's an amusing slash horror flick. Kane Hodder plays the crazed killer so that in my book makes the film worth watching.",1371945600,2,1745,4.253012048192771

Well, after some time I found myself wanting to check out the film again and the second time around I loved it. Going into this knowing what to expect gave me a new found appreciation for Hatchet, so much so that I consider it one of my favorite modern day slashers.
The characters here are great and offer plenty of laughs but their comedic tone dies down when Victor Crowley appears which gives you this rollercoster type of effect. It gets better every time I watch it.",1355011200,,792,4.387755102040816

Movies are for entertainment right? So I'm not sure who would be rating this movie low. It stars Kane Hodder and has the ""UNRATED"" logo sported right on the box! So if you're renting this expecting some mind-bending, intellectual horror film with a complex plot and great character development. Then rent ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Otherwise, if your looking for a fun horror that you and your friends can laugh and drink some beers to, go for it!

It has all the classic horror movie attributes; boobs, blood and the bad guy!

So honestly, not sure who would rent this expecting a Shakespearian epic, but for someone who feels like putting on a movie that can provide some laughs, a few jumps and possibly some good quotes.

3064820,5,B0011FLM00,"HATCHET

There has been many a debate about this film right here, some from both sides get very passionate about their feelings on this film. There are those who thought it was way over rated and then there are the ""Hatchet Army"" members who are all about it. I personally would fall between the two at various times when watching this since its release. At first I was not about this flick really because I went in expecting a serious horror flick. When I did that thanks to some friends I was rather let down. But once I actually went back and watched the behind the scenes and watched with the commentary I gained a new found respect for this flick.

See I was misinformed about this film and its intentions, this film is meant to be straight fun and nothing more. It is meant as a throw back to classic 80's slasher flicks and was supposed to be humorous and crazy. Go in with the brain off and I guarantee that this will be entertaining, and that is all, just a fun time. The commentary for this flick is excellent as well, one of the best I have listened to in a long time. And the behind the scenes stuff is great, what they did to get this flick made was great. I really respect these guys for getting this done; maybe I am a member of the ""Hatchet Army"".

The film follows a group of people in New Orleans and a girl named Marybeth who is looking for her brother and father. Her brother and father went missing in the swamp one night when they were hunting alligators. This group goes on a haunted boat ride in the swamp looking to see something spooky. The thing is most of them don't know about the ghost/killer that lurks in the woods known as ""Victor Crowley, or Hatchet Face"". And from those who have heard of him it seems only one knows the truth. So as they go deeper into the swamp their nightmares become more and more real.

That has all the makings of a great slasher flick right? Well for me the first time it was no but now I would say a very much yes. The things I found annoying the first time I now find hilarious. Some performances I thought were annoying the first time I now love, funny how ones mind state can affect your viewing experience. Any way I thought this film was really funny, especially Deon Richmond and Perry Shen. There is one moment from Shen that I and my brother rewound over and over again. That scene had us rolling on the floor, it was great.

Of course it is cool to see Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, and Tony Todd all on the same film again. Two are quick cameos but Hodder is the star killer here as poor Victor. The kills as one would expect are cool and the effects are good. It also does not hurt having those topless girls for most of the flick. I think the setting of the film may be my favorite thing about the film. It is at least one of the top reasons why I like the film. I would not like to be lost out in those swamps let alone with a killer ghost thing after me that is huge. Seriously Victor is a big boy and undead killer or not he looks like he could rip your head off.

Writer/producer/director Adam Green who also made the film ""Frozen"" that I reviewed really brought his a game here. Why wouldn't he either since this is a character he has had in his head since he was a kid. After going back and not watching the flick in a way it was not meant to be viewed I have to say he did a good job. The movie was really good and the behind the scenes stuff is really good as well. Add in the excellent commentary and you have a 5 star DVD/Blu-Ray.",1319241600,,3511,4.155882352941177
3064821,3,B0011FLM00,"If you enjoy seeing dumb mostly unlikeable characters being hacked up and ripped to shreds, the odds are you will appreciate Hatchet (2006).  Horror legend Kane Hodder (Friday the 13th series), plays Victor Crowley, a huge grotesque hulk, who lives in the swamps of Louisiana, and eviscerates anyone who has the misfortune of crossing his path.  The savage kills are the best thing about the film.  A number of them feature dismemberment, and are quite over the top.

It's Mardi Gras time, but looking to do something different, Ben (Joel David Moore) and his buddy Marcus (Deon Richmond) decide to join a group taking a haunted swap tour.  After a bus ride into the swamp, they board a small boat, and head out on the river for a night of thrills.  The tour abruptly ends when Shawn (Perry Shen), the inexperienced guide, gets the boat stuck on some rocks.  After an encounter with an alligator, the agitated bunch reaches the shore.

Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), one of the passengers, who pulled out a gun to scare off the alligator, reveals that she is looking for her missing father and brother.  Marybeth also informs the group about Victor Crowley, a huge freakish man who was accidentally killed some time back, when his father drove an axe into his skull.  Legend has it that Crowley still prowls the swamps, slaying whoever he meets.  Why all this matters is because Crowley's house is just up the hill from where the group has landed.  On cue, Crowley suddenly appears, and armed with an axe, murders two people, literally ripping their bodies apart.

Thus begins a slaughter in the swamp, as the brainless and extremely talkative group, tries to stay alive in what plays out like a really bad episode of Scooby Doo, except with some extremely gory kills.  Ben (who kind of looks like Shaggy) leads the group, who scamper around in the woods, only to end up travelling in a circle.  They then decide to try and trap the monster.  Like the Scooby Doo gang, things don't quite go as planned, but somehow they do manage to achieve their goal of setting Crowley on fire.  They flee into a cemetery, but not surprisingly, Crowley is already there, and makes another limb snapping kill.  The movie's extremely abrupt cliffhanger ending is disturbing, however the story would be continued almost exactly where it ended, in the sequel Hatchet II (2010), although with a different actress in the lead role. (So much for continuity!)

As Victory Crowley, Kane Hodder is scary as hell, although some of his jerky movements do look very ridiculous.  It seems that even if the victims acted intelligently, nothing could save them, as Crowley is practically invincible.  Even after being critically injured several times, he pops up later at places where he has no logical business being.  Despite the shocking gore and some occasional nudity, the film's attempts at humor, and limp dialog, make it a hard pill to swallow at times.  The characters are mostly annoying, obnoxious, dumb, and often cowardly.  Neither competent nor likeable, when this bunch is savagely ripped to shreds, it's hard to feel sorry for them.  Written and directed by Adam Green (Frozen), Hatchet is far from subtle, but it has its moments, particularly if you are in the mood for a chickens in the pen type massacre.  The unrated director's cut contains additional scenes, and also includes a commentary that is not included on the R rated version.",1310860800,2,3420,4.843373493975903

3064826,1,B0011FLM00,"A slasher film set in the creepiness of a Lousiness Bayou starring the unparalleled Kane Hodder as the killer?

How on earth did they screw that up?

The Marilyn Manson song starting the film off was an early warning sign, that kind of faux-edgy brainless garbage is incredibly indicative of the film's content.

The poltergeist explanation of Victor Crowley is used to annihilate any sense of atmosphere the film could have. There is no slow stalking with suspenseful music. Nearly every single kill is done in the same way. Characters are talking, Crowley literally teleports into there midst, roars stupidly, kills one of them and disappears for another few minutes. Kane Hodder is capable of the most menacing walk and body language of any actor in Hollywood and this film utterly FAILS to make use of it at all.

Yes slasher villains are basically indestructible, but Crowley's status as a ghost with a physical form makes him literally invincible. There is no conceivable way they can win. Not that they would anyway, but come on.

What was the point of this? It sure wasn't old-school American Horror. It was the one of the worst excesses of modern horror pretending to be a slasher film, like a child wearing his father's suit",1303171200,4,1234,4.829383886255924

3064828,3,B0011FLM00,"HATCHET is the best Slasher film to come out in the last thirty years -- at least according to creator Adam Green. There is no mistaking his love and enthusiasm for the genre, but HATCHET fails to live up to its own hype. Deep within the swamps of the Louisiana bayou, a tour boat filled with passengers crashes near the home of the legendary Victor Crowley, a deformed boy that was killed years ago but who continues to haunt the swamplands. Unfortunately for this group of teens, Victor Crowley lives, and he has an ax to grind with anyone who crosses into his domain!

Green clearly understands the classic conventions of the Slasher film, and better yet, he understands what most Slasher fans want: a ton of gore and even more gratuitous nudity. The problem is that HATCHET only delivers on these two superficial levels, and fails to bring a unique story, interesting characters, or even a steady pace. It starts strong enough with two incredibly violent deaths, but the plot plods on with only mild hints at humor and no kills. Finally, when the teens approach Crowley's house in the woods, things pick up dramatically (at least in the gore department). One character is hacked in half before his wife has her head ripped apart from her jaw in a gush of blood! From there, limbs fly, faces are sanded off, and heads are crushed before Crowley can finally be stopped... Or so it seems...

If the gruesome displays had only been spread out more evenly throughout the film, HATCHET may have at least been a more entertaining watch, but it takes far too long to get into the action with too little payoff. Minor things like the horribly artificial lighting also distract from the events on screen, although Joel Moore and Deon Richmond do their best to keep the audience involved. Kane Hodder also returns with another menacing villain as Victor Crowley, but what Green fails to realize is that there is just no marketability in a big misshapen monster. Without a hockey mask or a red and green sweater to sell come Halloween, Crowley just becomes another faceless killer trailing behind Cropsey and Madman Marz.

Considering this was only his first film, most Horror fans will be willing to forgive many of the film's weaknesses based on Green's inexperience, but HATCHET is a guilty pleasure at best.

It has a horror icon. (Granted it is no Freddy, Jason, or Michael.) It's everything a horror movie should be. It takes itself seriously when it needs to, and is down right hillarious when it needs to be. Adam Green is my freaking hero with this film.

3064837,3,B0011FLM00,"Aside from a bit of comic relief, Hatchet is a great return to old school horror.  In fact, if this had come advertised as the next sequel to Friday the 13th, I would have bought off on its authenticity.  Simply put, take this for what it is: mindless, traditional horror.

The premise is simple and all the low-grade horror rules are followed (e.g. cheesy comedy, full frontal nudity, stupid victim decisions).  A bunch of random characters go where they shouldn't - this time on a swamp cruise near New Orleans - slightly outside of cellphone coverage, and they just wander upon the local horror story of Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder - Jason, Friday the 13th), a disfigured mutant madman who was born into reclusion and has a nasty hatchet wound to the face.  Victor seems to miss his daddy quite a bit, and everyone who wonders upon his decrepit cabin in the remote swamp lands of Louisiana scares him enough that he has to break out his hatchet, shovel, or pitchfork to kill the interloper.

Gore galore, enough blood to start a wave pool, and extra prosthetic limbs for when bimbo tourists get theirs ripped off.  To warn at least one of the people on the cruise, ""Heads up!""  You won't find much new age CGI garbage here.  If anything, the kill scenes are the truest homage to traditional horror.  The production values and music are satisfactory, but

Don't go into this expecting Citizen Kane, and you won't be too upset.  It's kind of like taking a drink of soda when you expect water.  There are no additives here; it's simply water.  Enjoy the water...with just a little red food coloring.

He even managed to get some big time horror names, Kane Hodder ( whom if anyone knows me at all---im a HUGE fan) and Robert Englund.
The plot line is generic, a swamp tour in louisiana run by a asian guy that has no clue about the lore of the locals, or piloting a boat, for that matter. Once that boat runs aground, the usual mayhem accurs. Kane Hodder plays the villian, Victor Crowley, really terrifying and scary. It really is a ""must-see"" for any horror fan. If you watch the extras ( which I highly recommend) you find out a little tidbit about Kane Hodder, that when he plays a monster, he doesnt let the rest of the cast see him wandering about in make-up, the first time we see him in full-makeup is the first time the ""stars"" see him, also. It really is funny because half of them look like they peed their pants.",1269475200,2,1177,4.306306306306307
3064839,4,B0011FLM00,"Victor Crowley was born deformed and forced into seclusion with his father in a cabin in a New Orleans swamp. Ridiculed and tortured by the local children, he is thought to have burned alive until he returns years later and wreaks havoc on a boat tour full of tourists, entrepreneurs, air-heads and frat-boys. Crowley obviously has anger issues and a hatchet to grind, so to speak.

For writer/director Adam Green, ""Hatchet"" is a labor of love. The man grew up on 80's slashers such as ""Friday the 13th"" and it shows. Aside from casting the most notorious Jason Voorhees of them all - Kane Hodder - in the title role, the film is also host to other horror icons such as Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series) and Tony Todd (""Candyman"" himself). If the trio of horror royalty doesn't seal the deal, then surely the make-up effects by John Carl Buechler (whose credits are too long to list) certainly do. Buechler's work here runs the gamut from sickening to hilariously over-the-top (all about that belt sander!) and call back to a time when horror movies were pure escapism. No doubt, this is a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously (in sharp contrast to films like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"") but at the same time, is a quality slasher flick that doesn't skimp on the thrills.

From front to finish, all 84 minutes of ""Hatchet"" are pure slasher goodness. Rather than being just a stale homage to the franchise films that dominated his childhood, Green has actually created an icon all his own that pays loving tribute rather than references. While Victor Crowley may never reach the heights of Freddy, Jason or Michael, he's certainly the stuff fan-favorites are made of, appropriate for the cult classic that this film is destined to become. You just can't go wrong with a horror movie made by a fan with a talented cast and outrageous effects. It's the perfect movie to chill with on a Friday night and certainly one of the finest modern slashers to come along in a long time.

3064843,4,B0011FLM00,"If you grew up in the 80s and you've become disenchanted with the direction of current horror movies, then Hatchet is certainly for you. Hatchet harkens back to an era when horror movies were supposed to be fast paced, fun and most of all, entertaining. Like I said, if you grew up worshiping horror from the 80s, you will undoubtedly enjoy Hatchet. If you like your horror movies with a little more sophistication or a plot that is ripe with twists and turns...then you might want to avert your eyes.

Here is the backdrop for Hatchet. A group of friends head down to Mardi Gras to cheer up their pal, Ben (Joel Moore), who recently got dumped. Unfortunately, Ben is far too melancholy to enjoy the drunken debauchery and ample cleavage that New Orleans has to offer. So to take his mind off things he decides to track down a haunted swamp tour. His friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) begrudgingly tags along. Eventually, Ben, Marcus and a few others end up on a boat ride down the swampy Bayou led by a dim-witted Asian tour guide (Perry Shen). Alas, the swamps are haunted by a deformed madman named Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder), and he doesn't like trespassers.

What unfolds in the swamp is an amazing spectacle of grotesque gore and over the top violence. There are some incredibly unique death scenes in Hatchet and they won't disappoint your inner gorehound. One by one the members of the tour get picked off, but unlike most slasher films you almost feel bad for them. The actors do a great job of making these idiotic characters likable. You will be rooting for them to escape despite the odds stacked heavily in Crowley's favor. It all happens at a breakneck pace and you never have time to exhale as the movie kicks into high gear for the finale. Some won't like the ending, but I was more than satisfied with it.

Hatchet is a true homage to 80s filmmaking. It features genuinely funny banter between characters, tons of gratuitous nudity and over the top bloodshed. You will laugh, you will jump out of your seat and you will certainly wince away during Hatchet's finer moments. Be on the lookout for cameos from Robert Englund and particularly Tony Todd, who has a hilarious little role. While this film might have been considered ""by the numbers"" back in 1988 it feels fresh and new in 2008. Watch Hatchet with a big group of people, crack open some beers and enjoy the carnage.

3064844,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is a movie claiming to be an Old School American horror which may boast a bit too much. Not really sure what defines an American horror in the first place, you can only assume it's a throw back to the days where the slasher flick ruled. Judging by the blood soaked hatchet on the cover it was a safe assumption. If you're going into this film unsure if you will like it then you only have to ask yourself one question. Do you like non-stop gruesome gore? If you said yes then you are going to love this one.

We start with a group of very unlikeable characters as they cruise through a Louisiana swamp as part of a haunted boat tour run by some annoying Asian kid. Once the boat has an accident and begins to sink the crew must abandon ship to walk through the lush creepy forest in hopes of finding their way back to town. Only problem is the very woods they wander is said to be plagued by deformed maniac Victor Crowley. As they walk through the swamp freaks turf they see it's not just folklore once they start getting picked off one by one in extreme gore fashion.

Hatchet was hard to form an opinion on since we weren't really sure what to expect. Typically we hope for more of a chilling/edge of your seat thriller as opposed to a complete gore-fest. However the film was pretty entertaining. Especially for the fact that you can't stomach most of the cast and hope for them to get chopped up. Once you realize it's more of a horror-comedy that pays tribute to the Friday the 13th era you should have a good time with it. In no way is Hatched anything special but it will be loved by the gore enthusiast. When pondering if a young Sid would have enjoyed this the result is inconclusive.",1245369600,,1702,4.315625

3064846,2,B0011FLM00,"I want to start by saying that I grew up in the 80's, I know that makes me OLD, anyway, I have seen just about every hack n' slash movie from that era and some I love and some are awful.  I'll try to make this simple by outlining the pro's and con's but first the plot summary.

PLOT: A group of people go into the Louisiana swamps (that are closed) and encounter a killer.

A couple of *SPOILERS* below:
Pro's
1. The gore is definitely good in this flick, not a lot of CGI but more of the old school style with prosthetic appliances etc... That's an A in my book, because the effects look more realistic.

2. Great opening action and set up.  The pace is fast and really gets you into the movie.

3. The atmosphere is creepy and the sound effects are good.

4. The DVD quality was terrific, clear picture and sound.

Con's
1. The characters are awful because of really bad writing.  I know your supposed to have bad actors in horror but really the dialogue needs to be believable at least.  The ""comedic"" moments are so poorly done.

2. The pacing stinks, after that great opening sequence the brakes are put on and the whole thing starts to crawl.  Ok, I know that's normal in a slasher flick but this one takes too long to get going again and with that inane dialogue it's really hard to care about anything happening.

3. The killer looks like Jason because it's essentially the same mask!  Come on, I know Kane Hodder played the part in John Beuchler's (special effects creator on this film) Friday the 13th Part 7 but come up with something more than Jason's mask.  I mean really, that's just lame.

4. Predictable to the extreme, although the black character isn't the first to die in this one, but that's about it as far as any surprises.

I would not say that this movie was awful but it didn't hold my interest, however, the gore scenes were good.  If you just want gore this one will do the trick but otherwise it's not the most enjoyable ""throwback"" movie that is out there.  My personal favorites would be Splinter or Dark Ride.  While Dark Ride isn't terrific, it was one of the first to restart this genre of bringing splatter back to the theaters.",1241049600,3,2163,4.36
3064847,2,B0011FLM00,"I see folks saying that ""Hatchet"" is an ""homage"" and or ""spoof"" of 1980's slasher flicks, and don't quite understand why? To me the ""homage/spoof"" to 80's slashers was already perfected with ""Scream"". ""Hatchet"" does play out like a horror/comedy, but captures none of the feel of it's 1980's predecessors.

What I liked about the movie - It was great seeing some of horror's leading men sharing screen time, Kane Hodder (Jason), Robert Englund (Freddy) and Tony Todd (Candyman) all make appearances in the film. (Hodder pulls double duty playing both parts of the Crowley clan, so we get an extended non-makeup cameo). Of course this has been done before in flicks like ""Wishmaster"" and ""Behind the Mask"". I liked too that the special effects were old school latex and rubber as opposed to CGI. The best part of the film for me though was the character Marcus played by Deon Richmond whose one-liners lightened up an otherwise dreary and lifeless script. Richmond was the ONLY element of comedy that worked in the entire film, the rest was fairly lifeless and flat.

What I didn't like about the film - I guess the idea of ""spoofing"" the slasher genre was to take everything over-the-top. The characters were all over-the-top stereotypes, with the trashy girls flashing boobs so often it actually became boring. The nerdy guy was too nerdy, the hillbilly swamp people were over-the-top rednecks, and even the blood was way over the top. I like gore as much as the next guy, but I like it to flow with some realism. The splatter found in ""Hatchet"" was just a notch below what was seen in ""Kill Bill"", fountains would spray everywhere when someone was chopped, and it just looked ridiculous. What really grated on my nerves, and where any 1980's comparison is lost, is when it came to the killer Victor Crowley. Is he a ghost? Is he a monster? Does anyone really know? Does anyone care? While Victor's backstory is perfect for a slasher villain, the actual ""creature"" is kind of lame. Looking like a cross between ""Pumpkinhead"" and Jason Voorhees from ""Jason Takes Manhattan"", Crowley isn't very scary. Plus he runs and screams...which is never good for a slasher villain. The film would have been much better had Victor simply ""stalked"" his victims, instead we see him running around like crazy, waving his arms and screaming??!

If you want a genuine spoof of 80's slashers, pick up either ""Scream"" or ""Behind the Mask"" both are fantastic, and spoof the genre without falling to the level of stupidity found in ""Hatchet"".",1239926400,,2521,4.817551963048499

The first half is more comedy (but comedy that is actually funny!) than horror as we are introduced to the characters who are most very likeable and funny, the blonde bimbo being particularly funny, as she is purposely exaggerated as a parody of the usual blonde, buxom heroine in slasher movies.

The comedy ends and the horror begins about halfway through as the characters, having all met on a boat to go on a horror trip as a break from the parties of Mardi Gras, get stranded in the woods with a hatchet weilding, deformed maniac. There is a good reason behind why the killer kills and the death scenes are all very gory, plus I liked the twist in the end.

A deformed maniac who looks like the Elephant man on steroids uses his hatchet to kill the tourists who stumble upon his cabin after their boat is stranded.

  What if the USS Minnow of ""Gilligan's Island"" had shipwrecked on an island inhabited by Jason Voorhees?  What you would have is ""Hatchet.""  The characters are silly and hilarious.  I laughed more than I screamed.  The two bimbos who are tricked by a slimy director into filming ""Bayou Beaver"" are incredibly stupid.  The blonde one who has never heard of NYU keeps insisting that the police and the cops are different entities.

  The acting is good; the dialogue is hilarious.  The cast consists of cameos from actors who portrayed famous serial killers such as Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) and Tony Todd (Candyman).  The huge Kane Hodder (who dressed up as Jason in later entries of the ""Friday the 13th"" films) is Victor Crowley.  Joel David Moore (""Sprial"") stars as Ben who convinces his best friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) to take the haunted boat tour; Ben befriends Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) who is searching for her missing father and brother, victims of Victor Crowley.

  High body count fiends, like myself, and gorehounds will enjoy ""Hatchet.""  Many of the death scenes are incredibly violent and gory.  Victor Crowley loves to rip limbs and organs out of tourists who trespass on his property.  He behaves more like a raging animal than a human.  There is a great deal of suspense as potential victims try to hide and/or outrun Victor.  The legend of how he became a monster is very interesting and reminded me much of ""The Burning.""  Pranksters set fire to his house on Halloween night when he was a child.  He was supposedly killed when his father tried to break the door down with an axe.  However, like Jason, he managed to survive in order to seek revenge.

  ""Hatchet"" is highly recommended for fans of slasher flicks from the eighties that involved killers in the woods such as ""Final Terror,"" ""Friday the 13th, ""The Burning,"" and ""Madman.""  It has a wonderfully downbeat, open ending that was often found in horror films of the seventies and eighties.  I recommend watching it late at night with some friends during a beer and pizza party.",1235692800,,2538,4.814385150812065
3064852,4,B0011FLM00,"I'd heard about Hatchet on the internet sometime back but paid it no mind as I thought it was another cheap attempt at old school horror when most movies I'd seen to make that kind of claim was just a waste of my time. I can't tell you how many movies I've seen make the claim that it was the best film of 'this or that' genre of all-time only to be a real waste of celluloid(so you can understand why I was skeptical) Yet, when I seen the trailer for the movie on the ""His Name Was Jason"" DVD, I decided that- if I came across the film- I'd get it and view it. Wouldn't you know it, folks, I find it the very next day. So, I buy it and viewed it & can honestly say that it lives up to its' hype f giving us some old school american horror. It's hard to believe that this story came from the mind of an 8 year old boy.

The story goes a little something like this...A group of tourists go on a Haunted Swamp Tour only to find the legend of Victor Crowley to be true when people start dying left and right. Who is Victor Crowley, you might ask? A deformed Louisiana swamp dweller who lays waste to all those who come on his turf. Directed by Adam Green, the movie stars Joel Moore, Tamara Feldman, Deon Richmond, Mercedes McNab, Parry Shen, Joleigh Fioreavanti, Joel Murray, with cameos by Joshua Leonard(Blair Witch Project), Tony Todd(Candyman), Kane Hodder(Friday the 13th 7-8-9-10) & Robert Englund(A Nightmare on Elm Street series). Special Features include: Audio Commentary, The Making of Hatchet, Meeting Victor Crowley, Guts and Gore, Anatomy of a Kill, A Twisted Tale, Gag reel & trailer. Trailers for ""Spiral"", ""Beyond the Mask:the Rise of Leslie Vernon"", ""Karas: Revelation"", and Anchor Bay's horror line are also included. The film, itself, won lots of awards in 2006 as being one of the best films of the year.

I'm inclined to agree, it is a great movie with the right amount of terror and mayhem & humor as well. Yes, I said humor. It doesn't weigh down the movie, mind you. It only makes it better. Overall, it was a fun slasher movie to watch that earns its' place amongst all the greats out there. Everyone is entitled to their opinion concerning this movie...that's why I suggest you get this movie and make up your own mind about it.",1233964800,,2253,4.400479616306955

NOT!

I had even signed on with the Hatchet - brigade - or whatever it was called before the film came out...

I would go so far as to demand that these Filmmakers ask those Legends of Slasher films for an apology for using their (films) memory as a marketing ploy - because if you didn't grow up on 80s Horror and you think Hatchet is it, you're sadly mistaken. It was never about the funny, and that's all this film tries to be: about the funny.

For those of you looking for a cool Evil Dead 2-esque take on the slasher genre, you will be extremely disappointed with this hack job of a film.  Hatchet goes something like this:  After a painfully long and dull setup, teens get trapped in the bayou and stalked by an invincible burn victim.  One gets killed, and they run to another part of the bayou and bicker.  Then the maniac shows up again, kills one of them, and they run another 100 yards (somehow shaking the guy off their trail).  Repeat.  It all gets so repetitive that I soon wished the killer would be a little more efficient in doing his work.  In my opinion, Hatchet replaces Slumber Party Massacre 3 as being the worst slasher movie ever made.  I am quite sure that watching it actually destroyed brain cells.

For an awesome slasher movie that's got campy laughs, I encourage you to revisit some of the 80's yarns like SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT (""Punish!"") or FRIDAY THE 13th PART 6 ""Jason Lives"" (Jason get reanimated by a bolt of lightning).",1227830400,5,1180,4.549763033175355

3064864,3,B0011FLM00,"""Hatchet"" is definitely one of the most talked-about horror movies of the past year or so, but not necessarily talked-about in a good way; this movie has recently become notorious for getting many mixed reactions. I myself even feel mixed about this movie. So the big question with ""Hatchet"" is this: WHY does this movie get so many mixed reactions?
The biggest reason in my opinion is this: ""Hatchet"", as funny and gory as it is, suffers from being UNEVEN.
I personally liked the movies because the first half was basically a comedy, and rather entertaining at that. The movie also has excellent gore, though the first three kills are a little hard for my eyes to watch. Anyway, I also think the characters of this movie are very true to life. I can really see myself and a friend of mine acting like Ben and Marcus, at least a little bit.
So the humor, gore and characters are all strong points of ""Hatchet"", so why do people dislike it? I, like many other people, feel like this:
Well, let me ask you this: Why did all the Friday the 13th and Halloween movies keep you entertained? They were consistent with the action, murders and plot! There would be a slower scene of people talking, then somebody goes off and gets killed. The pace picks up a bit, and the tension rises.
With ""Hatchet"", everything occurs slowly, and basically saves most of the horror for the end. Don't get me wrong, that can definintely work in movies, just look at the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". They basically saved the scariest stuff for the last half-hour.
But with ""Hatchet"", it's easy to get bored, frustrated or agitated at the movie because it's very inconsistent, and the characters are often getting angry or acting dumb...all right, never mind that last part, lots of characters make bad choices in slasher films, heh-heh.
So what's the final verdict on ""Hatchet""?:
If you want a funny slasher-horror with lots of gore, RENT IT.
If you want a short, easily digestable movie and have nothing better to do with your time, RENT IT.
If you want a genius OR serious OR consistent horror movie, SKIP IT.
If you want an original movie that breaks new ground, or it at least rather imaginative, SKIP IT.

So ""Hatchet"" was good for a one-time view and I might search it again online and rewatch it sometime in the future. I can tell that they had lots of great ideas for this movie but unfortunately, all the good stuff as in funny scenes, gore shots and character development, was mixed with boring stuff, frustrating stuff, or just generally uninteresting scenes. Watch it if you like, but don't expect Victor Crowley to take Jason Voorhees's spotlight in the Slasher Hall of Fame! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1224806400,,2702,4.664570230607967

The tour doesn't happen quite as planned and hijinx ensue.

My major gripe with the film is the antagonist and its back story. I thought it was just something stupid and thrown together.

3064867,2,B0011FLM00,"No other film has received such mixed reviews more than ""HATCHET"" among my amazon friends. Most of them, hated this film, while lately, it has began to achieve a minor cult following. ""Hatchet"" is the type of film that definitely depends on what you are looking for in a movie experience. I think a film requires somewhat of an acquired taste, but one thing, I have to say it is a homage to the 80's ""slasher"" flicks and NOT to be taken seriously.

Mardi Gras, New Orleans: two friends, Marcus (Deon Richmond) and Ben (Joel David Moore) are gallivanting around the town, drinking and scoping out the sights (I mean half naked women). Ben becomes insistent on taking a haunted swamp tour. They come across a pretty but moody young local woman named Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) who is actually looking for her father and her brother who had disappeared in this same swamp some nights ago. When the boat hit's a boulder and sinks, the group is forced to walk back to the city. Little do they know that a monstrous killer called Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) is hot on their trail and they must fight their way to survive.

Adam Green's low-budget is an attempt to return to the days of Jason, Madman, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger because it is well-known that iconic killers can make such a low-budget film shine. There are two ways to approach this film. Take it as a humorous venture into the world of slasher flicks, much like you should see ""Eight Legged Freaks"" and ignore whatever faults it has. Another way, is to envision the film as something where there is no ambition in its casting, it follows the same formulaic elements and criticize its measly budget. But the question has to be, did the film present a new successful figure in the books of ""slashing"" villains?

Well, Victor Crowley is a blend of Jason Voorheese and Freddy Krueger, mixed in with Leatherface and Madman. The film would owe a lot of royalties to other iconic slasher films. Crowley just won't die, no matter how many times you stab him, shoot him or burn him. Crowley just keeps on going and revels on the murder that he has been doing. I would like to see him take on Jason. ""Victor vs. Jason"" anyone? (oh no, did I just pitch an idea?)

The film doesn't bring anything new to the horror genre and has a very ""exaggerated"" execution and it does it intentionally. Director/writer Adam Green knew that he had to make fun of his own creation. The characters are a vacationing couple, two friends looking for a good time, a couple of air headed bimbos, a pervert and a young woman on a mission led by an Asian man. The characters themselves seemed very unlikable, and Green meant it to be this way. The script is too hollow and the dialogue can get laughable if you don't see that it was meant to be this way. ""Janey's got a gun"", a statue masturbating, and the quippy attempts at humor by Deon Richmond and Perry Chen can either be annoying or amusing. The proceedings do seem pointless a lot of times.

Now, the film does have some inventive ""kill"" sequences. The blood and gore are done ""old-school"" way; no CGI or special effects--the film utilizes the use of prosthetics and a lot of gooey red ink. Japanese splatter horror elements are sometimes used on some scenes to again make fun of itself. Turning one's head 180 degrees or ripping the arms out of their sockets may not be original but it is fun to watch. Yes, if you are looking for an abundance of blood and gore, then this film will satisfy--just don't think it will be horrifying, it will for the most part, feel a little comedic.

""Hatchet"" is a actually more a cheesy attempt on comedy than a horror film. I do accept the fact that the film is making fun of itself, but the characters are just plain bad that they're bad. I do try to see it as a homage and all, but I just can't say for sure just what the filmmakers wanted to do. It's not really funny, but funny in a way that it is silly. It isn't scary, the gore effects while well-done doesn`t feel unnerving. To its credit, I did laugh out loud at some scenes and the film does have a good amount of nudity. Kane Hodder is both amusing and imposing as the killer. I do think Adam Green probably loved his slasher flicks so much that he wanted to relive them. I'm not exactly sure what Green expected from his viewers.

Does it feel like I'm confused? I am. Maybe that is what Adam Green wanted, a audience full of mixed reactions, as a result of his mixed direction. I'll take ""JASON X"" over this.

3064868,4,B0011FLM00,"Happy Halloween everyone!!  If you haven't heard by now, ""Hatchet"" is Adam Green's homage to the 1980s Slasher genre; but not just your everyday, psychopath on the loose Slasher.  This pays homage to the Slasher Immortals:  Jason, Michael, Candy Man, Freddy... ...you know; the guys who never die.  As a rule, I hate these characters.  They become predictable and tiresome because no matter what you do to them, they'll come back for more.  I make one exception for these guys; their first films.  Since ""Hatchet"" is a ""first"" film, I'll cut it some slack.  Despite my less than enthusiastic tone, I really enjoyed this film.  Let's take a deeper look at it...

-THE TONE OF THIS FILM; IT'S USUALLY RED.
If you take Adam Green at his word (why not?), this is suppose to be a serious horror film with funny characters; not a horror comedy.  However he chose to rationalize it, it's a horror movie that you can laugh at.  I happen to love horror comedies, so he can shove his disclaimer up his ""yoo-hoo"".  Whatever his intensions, there was little about this film you could take too seriously other than the fact people were dying.  Don't get me wrong, the terror is real but never are your emotions challenged.  I snickered and chortled throughout most of it.  That's a good thing in my book.

-LIKE MY RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS, MY EMOTIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE BLEEDING!!
It's a good thing I didn't invest a lot of emotion into these characters.  Not that they aren't well developed or acted, because they are.  It's because even at their most likable, they are annoying people.  The lead character is played by Joel David Moore (why does everyone have 3 names these days?).  This guy is a wimpy version of David Schwimmer (is that possible?); so whiny and annoying.  He is accompanied by one of his wise cracking buds, played by Deon Richmond; the smartest person in the film but the one nobody listens too.  The heroine is played by Tamara Feldman.  In case you're wondering, she's the only young lady who does not display her assets in this film.  She might be the only one I cared about in the end.  The rest of the cast are clichs including a pervert doctor pretending to be a movie producer and his pair of duped and desperate actresses, a retired couple who could be Sarah Palin's parents, and the con-man tour guide whom we can blame for everything.  So, as the inevitable body count mounts, I had more sense of anticipation than dread.

-GORDITY; TWO GREAT TASTES THAT TASTE GREAT TOGETHER!
For those of you just skimming:  Gore + Nudity = Gordity.  ""Hatchet"" has ample and requisite amounts of both.  The nudity is what I'd call ""requisite"" because it's done in the guise of Mardi gras in New Orleans mixed with a faux ""Girls Gone Wild"" video shoot.  It is purposefully gratuitous and comedic but limited to flipping up of the tops.  I didn't complain.  The Gore was ""ample"", OFF THE CHARTS and too ludicrous to take seriously; way over the top!  This is a rare case where ""Unrated"" actually has valid meaning.  It's almost as if this films sole purpose was to revel in the creative kill.  When gas powered belt sanders (WTF?) are involved, then there are no limits in sight.  I'm not a gore hound, but this was done in such an over the top and entertaining way that I enjoyed it immensely.

-LET ME RESHOOT THE ENDING. (I won't tell you the ending but Spoilers ensue)
As this story starts out, we are introduced to characters in various states of cheer participating in Mardi gras.  Our lovelorn lead wants to forget about women by taking a haunted swamp tour.  The events prior to and during this portion are actually entertaining lead-ins to the carnage that follows.  Along the way we get to see Robert Englund, Tony Todd (in a very funny little role), and a puking chick.  The high jinx portion of the film ends with a goofy musical interlude during a ride on the short-bus; I'm not kidding.  As our cast gets lost in the swamp and the carnage ensues, I start to suspect a clever ending coming on.  I'm thinking; ""If this ends like I think it will, then this film is brilliant!""  Well, I outsmarted myself (or the Director).  I don't usually think my ideas are great, but this one was a natural.  You see, like Freddy and Jason and Michael, Victor (the mutated killer played by ""Jason"" Kane Hodder) is indestructible on a mortality level; you can't kill the dude.  This is the very reason I don't enjoy these films.  I thought it would have been really cool if some how, there were 15 of these dudes running around the haunted swamp.  That would have been a stunner!  But no; it's just one guy who can't be killed.  When I realized this, the cleverness of the film withered just a little.  I've seen enough bogy-men films.  I was hoping for a killer who wasn't superhuman.  For me, this was a case of taking homage a step too far.  The ending was a big THUD to me.

-THE END?
I'd have to recommend this to slasher fans and gore fans in general.  If you don't like horror comedies, then Adam Green made this for you, even though I got a lot of laughs and gruesome giggles out of it.  There is little mystery to this film since we are introduced to the killer very early and nothing is hidden.  I could forgive this film for rehashing the bogyman theme (which I'm tired of) because it was so witty and entertaining.  The annoying characters were well played and the production values were top notch.  I wish the story had taken a more creative turn without abandoning its homage theme, but the story as a whole was good enough.  The DVD is loaded with good ""making of"" material and commentary.  If they make a sequel with 15 Victors running around the swamps of Louisiana yelling ""DAAADDDYYY!!!"" then it was my idea.  Happy Halloween!!

3064869,2,B0011FLM00,"I heard a lot of positive things about this film. Some people even called it the ""best horror film of the year"" and commented that it was bringing 80's style horror back to the present day.

I didn't see that at all.

Hatchet is, at best, a gore flick.

If you are a fan of blood and guts, check this out. I honestly can appreciate a little bit of gore if it is done with a little bit of realism and doesn't delve far into the over-the-top, pointless realm. Hatchet dives right in. Let's face it, this movie had so much gore, I think we should just call it Al Gore.

The first scene involves a man being thrown into a tree, his arm torn off, his intestines pulled out and then his body ripped in half-all the while the poor guy screaming, ""IT HURTS!!!"" i just found it tacky and disgusting.

There are other scenes where a person's face face is pulled in half by the mouth and you see a wiggling tongue...a guy is literally hacked at for 30 seconds of cringe inducing disgust...another character has there face sanded off with a sand blaster and is left crawling around for a bit while the killer hacks at another victim. The kills are just really gross. I love horror, but I found the blood and guts just WAY too gross for my taste. And I can appreciate gore.

The gore is definetly worth it for those of you who enjoy that...but, for me, it killed the movie.

The plot was confusing. I didn't understand the whole ""mutated boy is burned alive in his shack but is still alive hacking people up in the swamp"" scenario. I mean, it's been done before with Jason...I get that...but this movie felt less condusive than the Friday series. The origin of the killer here is left more up in the air.

Also, I agree with a couple reviewers that the killer is shown FAR too much. He looks like a redneck Quasi-modo and despite his akward and icky appearance, his features and body makeup looked way too fake for me. He looked like a guy running around in a costume to me trying to be scary.

The acting was horrendous and definetly completely D-list. I did recognize the older lady from an episode of Roseanne and the blonde girl from the show Angel, but that was about it.

Anyways, it's not ""smart"" horror or anything new...but it should please the gore-hounds.

3064879,4,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet came with a lot of hype even before the movie started to shoot there was a lot of hype behind the film and expectations were quite high. There was a great marketing campaign and a lot of slasher fans had some high expectations. The hype of a film is a good thing and bad thing. The good it gets the word out on the film and helps gain it attention, but the bad is again the expectations people will now have will be very high.

Hatchet is very much in the style of an 80s slasher flick, but has enough going for it that it doesn't feel dated. I've seen a few movies inspired by 80s horror flicks and the filmmaker does such a great job at capturing that style that the movie even if just released feels dated so sometimes capturing that feel can also have it's downsides. Adam Green captures the basic concept of the early 80s slasher flick perfectly, but as much in common with the early 80s it also a lot of the mid to late 80s campy, but intentional feel.

Let's get one thing straight; don't go into Hatchet expecting a straight up slasher flick. If anything it's much more of a parody without beating you over the head with it, and I'm sure that is something a lot viewers weren't expecting. Most were probably expecting a more straight forward approach. The early marketing campaign did make it seem it would a more serious approach, which at times it is, but other times it isn't; in my opinion this is what makes Hatchet such a great ride.

I'm kind of surprised that so many people had such high expectations for Hatchet. I do enjoy slasher flicks from time to time where as when I was a kid I lived for them. But seriously most slasher flicks aren't very good. Yes they are a lot of fun to watch, but if you were to see a list of the greatest horror movies of all time only a handful of them would be slashers. The slasher film is just a fun movie that we like maybe a little more than we should.

Hatchet though is clearly one of the better slasher flicks and it's not just an excellent slasher movie, but an excellent movie in general. I guess I understand some of the complaints due to the expectations, but when you ask people what exactly they expected in most cases they can't answer they just say I thought it would be different. If you are a fan of 80s slasher flicks you should love Hatchet. Its gone hot women, nudity, great kill scenes and a lot of gore; isn't that what the slasher film is about?

The slasher flick started to die out a bit in the late 80s and by the 90s they were all, but gone until Scream revived it for a while, but in the years since Scream slasher flicks sort of went away again. Mainstream wise they're pretty much dead, but the DTV scene has a lot of slashers, but the problem is the filmmakers know there's an audience and there's no care, just trying to make a quick buck. Adam Green on the other hand clearly made this movie with the right intentions. Where all these filmmakers fail Adam Green succeeds.

The one thing that surprised me was at how well written Hatchet was; like I stated earlier most slasher flicks really weren't good per se, but enjoyable. The screenplay by Adam Green was actually really good, which was something I really didn't expect. The script was smart and creative and his characters were really great. Most of these movies have weak characters that basically are just there to pad out the body count, but Green makes the best of them all. Each character adds to the movie and honestly I didn't want any of them to die since they were so entertaining.

The slasher flick has been done a million times and really since the end of the 80s they haven't been the same. Every so often we get that one slasher flick that's enjoyable, but not nearly as enjoyable as those of the 80s, but Hatchet is the best slasher flick since the 80s and simply one of the best slashers period. There's something sort of funny about slasher flicks; the characters are often stupid and the kill scenes are so absurd it's hard to take serious and by the late 80s filmmakers started playing up to that. That's what Adam Green does and that really is why Hatchet works so well. The comedy aspect might turn some people off, but it had to be that way. As much fun as the early 80s slasher movies were they were also silly and the mid to late 80s filmmakers embraced that as does Adam Green. I don't think a straight forward approach would work as well. Hatchet is campy at times and the kills are over the top, but that was the whole point. Everything you see was intentional.

When it comes to horror filmmakers most people cite Rob Zombie, Eli Roth or Alexandre Aja as the best out there right now and while I do enjoy their work my money is on Adam Green as long as he continues to work in the horror genre. As director Adam Green does a great job here; He's able to create plenty of laughs, but also provide some really great suspenseful moments as well. By watching the DVD features it's quite clear Adam was living out his dream with this movie and that energy he had on set shines in the product. Like I stated these types of movies are a bit absurd at times and Adam Green plays up to these things and makes such an enjoyable movie.

I think there are many great horror flicks out there right now, but the problem is they seem to lack the fun factor they once had and Adam Green brings that back. From beginning to end Hatchet is just a fun movie. Again you'll laugh and even maybe feel the suspense and sometimes you'll get both at the same time. Adam plays up to the clichs and silly moments these movies have and delivers a great and enjoyable movie.

Victor Crowley played by Kane Hodder is a villain the past. You just don't see characters like this anymore in horror and I wasn't sure how well he would work in this era, but Adam Green and Hodder create a great new Iconic villain. Crowley is something out of the 80s and actually reminds me a bit of Madman Marz of the movie Madman, only Crowley is the better of the two and Hatchet is by far the better movie. Don't expect another Jason Voorhees, which many were expecting since Kane played the part, but Crowley is very 80s, but with a solid modern update.

The strongest aspect of Hatchet was the cast; all the actors were clearly having fun and it really shows. Again the characters are very well written and the scenes with Misty played by Mercedes McNab and Jenna played by Joleigh Fioreavanti are probably the most entertaining of the movie. These 2 girls work so well together. Misty is the typical dumb blonde and the actress very much plays up to that. Deon Richmond and Parry Shen though steal the show. These 2 guys were hysterical together and on their own. Joel David Moore is excellent as the hero Ben; he's a normal guy and really easy to relate to and Tamara Feldman as MaryBeth makes for an excellent heroine. Again all the characters are excellent and every one of them adds to the movie rather than being just there to die.

The kill scenes in Hatchet are great and the gore is plenty and the best part is it wasn't all CGI, which has been a problem in this genre the last few years. The F/X were done by John Carl Buechler who appears as Jack Cracker and is best known to horror fans as the director of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood. There are also cameos by the Iconic Robert Englund and Tony Todd

I get why so many people found Hatchet a letdown and had I not known it was more of a parody I probably would have disappointed with it as well. And I also get due to the hype expectations are probably very high and seeing as Hatchet got over so well at film festivals like Tribeca again expectations were high. But I urge anyone reading this that expected a straight up slasher flick or expected more out of it to give Hatchet another chance. As much as I enjoyed Hatchet I think it actually gets better on multiple viewings. Hatchet is essential viewing for any slasher fan; Adam Green wanted to make something that was just simply fun and entertaining and he very much delivers on that.",1217030400,2,8044,4.333333333333333

""Hatchet"" is so well written and so well directed I would give it an Oscar. Adam Green's 80s style slasher movie is the most refreshing thing I've seen in quite some time as it goes back to basics and does so very successfully. This is not a remake, it's not a sequel and it's not based on a Japanese film. It's Friday the 13th on acid and above all it's bloody brilliant!""(*SD) I had heard Hatchet was funny, Is it a horror film trying to be funny? In that case is the horror element the point of the joke and will it devalue the shocks and terror? Or is it a comedy trying to be scary? And in that case is it perfectly gory and nasty yet totally unfunny? Well it's neither, because  it's scary, it's gory and it's hilarious. It never tries to be a spoof of slasher movies. It's a pure tribute to what the slasher movie was and still should be, yet has the comedic elements throughout to indicate that yes that's a maniac severing limbs all across the woods but hey S*** happens!",1216944000,2,1042,4.236180904522613
3064881,2,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet- Unrated
Do you love comedy and horror? I do. Do you love them together? Me neither. They are two things that I don't think will ever work together. This movie is horrible and I hope you read this review carefully before even thinking about purchasing this movie. The back of the DVD case advertises its wonderful gore and nudity. Honestly, that is all this movie has that can be even considered good. That's right, the nudity is better than most of the movie itself. That's when you know a movie is bad.

The story is that a group of friends travel to New Orleans for Marti Gras. One of them has just broken up with his girlfriend and all the nudity is just making him depressed. He convinces one of his friends to come with him on a scary boat ride. Along on the ride are: Porn Stars, a fake director, an Asian tour guide, an older couple, and a mysterious girl. Eventually the horrible tour guide crashes into a rock. They escape the sinking boat only to find themselves in front of Victor Crowley's house. Victor Crowley was deformed as a child. Some kids were picking on him and went to the extreme and started a fire in his house. Victor's father came home to try to save him but instead he killed him by an accidental hatchet shot to the face. Naturally from there Victor controls the woods around the swamp and kills people. The group of people try to survive the monster, but are slowly picked off one by one.

If anything, the story sounds like any other cheap slasher movie. This is added in with some moronic teenage humor and you have the makings of a horrible film. I will say that I thought Victor and his origins were nicely done. Other then that the rest of the story is downright bad.

One thing that is a big plus for this movie is the gore factor. It's off the charts. The type of killing is unrealistic, but is very well done. You will see arms being ripped off, bodies ripped in half, and heads ripped apart by the jaws. Truly this is the best part of the movie. I would actually suggest just skipping to these parts if you own this movie.

This movie also advertises ""eye-popping nudity"" on the back of the case. There are a lot of women flashing people in the beginning, but not much after that. If for some reason you need more nudity in your films, you won't find it on this DVD.

Extras are your standard commentary track and making of stuff. The making of stuff is pretty cool because it shows you how they did a lot of the gore and stuff. They even show how they decided to do the gore with the use of action figures. You also get outtakes, but how many times are you going to watch that.

Skip this movie unless you are an absolute die hard for cheap slasher films. The acting in this movie is downright pitiful. Most of the actors are side characters from other, better films. If you want a good movie you should just keep of looking.",1215907200,2,2873,4.320964749536178

They get killed by something and then Marilyn Manson starts the movie with his song, This Is The New Sh*&. It best describes horror movies of today-everything has been done before. Then Tony Todd shows up looking like a lead in gay version of Phantom of The Opera. Wow, two good horror actors wasted in one film with pointless cameos. The film is slow even though the characters are cliched, I still enjoyed the two fighting ladies who are doing a porno and the black guy was funny. The killings are enjoyable but when I read the headline ""Old School American Horror"", they should have used a make up artist like Tom Savani to do the gore instead of a computer. I like the horror films of 70's and 80's because they didn't use computers and it looked better and more realistic. I still like horror movies with computer graphics but not when it comes to most slasher movies. Kane Hodder did a good job as the killer but nothing could save this movie. The ending sucked and I can already smell a sequel.

The current trend seems to stuck on translating Japanese horror for American audiences.  While this worked at first, it has grown stale.  Hatchet is a return to a more ""classic"" slasher film, something that outside the 70's and early 80's isn't done well or often anymore.

The acting isn't necessarily the best outside Kane Hodder.  The story is just enough to set the stage.  There is blood and plenty of it, as well as a few novel deaths.  The mix of dark comedy and horror works in my opinion.  The extra features are a nice treat, especially watching Kane Hodder scare the cast.

Well, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, even for a slasher film. I didn't expect it to be as quirky. I wanted it to be darker. I didn't mind the poor story and acting. You expect those with any slasher film.

One thing I loved was the effects. No CGI involved. This was a true classic slasher if for no other reason. One scene in particular I'm certain any slasher fanatic will love (and they even have a special feature that's shown how it's down, without CGI).

If you're not a fan of classic horror, this movie isn't for you. If you're into torture/victim horror, this isn't for you. If you wonder what would happen if they made a classic horror movie today, then Hatchet is the one to see.

I'll admit that I wasn't blown away by the plotline, or acting; very predictable stuff here. The effects were great, though Crowley's make-up job was a little campy. I think it had to be in order for this to work though. No CG-infected gore either. Hatchet chose to go to the roots of what make a classic a classic: a scary ""monster,"" a wooded area, brief nudity, predicable plot, stereotypical characters, an opening for a sequel. They did a good job, here. Was nothing spectacular, nothing groundbreaking, but it's a movie.

Though I love the classics, they're classic for a reason. They gave us the foundation for stuff that comes out today. I'm more of a fan of movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00005JLTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>, even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chainsaw/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chainsaw</a>&nbsp;remake.

Hatchet didn't do that. You knew who was going to die and who would survive. The backstory could have been left out, as it was predicable to the plot.

Despite what I didn't like about it, the movie wasn't terrible. Good to see Kane Hodder out of make-up. Good to see Robert England too, wrinkles and all. The special features were pretty good, giving us insight as to how the movie was made and why. As the film ended, I kept saying to myself: ""Please don't make a sequel to this one. It just isn't necessary."" But I'm afraid I'll be let down. Maybe not, though.

3064914,2,B0011FLM00,"This low-budget indie film is generally a hatchet job. Its only redeeming virtue is the few glimpses it offers of daytime New Orleans Bourbon Street festivities.

Well, there's also the ""Behind-the-Scenes"" look at the making of the movie included in the DVD bonus features. This is almost more entertaining than the movie itself. The filmmakers' obvious enthusiasm for their project is infectious. And they do offer one potentially valuable tip for the makers of future horror flicks. They tell how they didn't let any of the to-be-terrorized-actors see the psychopathic menace who would be threatening them on screen - until the creature actually burst upon them in the makeshift swamps with the cameras rolling. The individual playing the ""hatchet man"" kept a low profile among his fellow actors, and like a bride on her wedding day, certainly never let any of the others see him in his costume beforehand.

This would be an interesting, effective technique, in cases where the hatchet-wielding menace isn't so ludicrous.

One warning about this film's maniac: His presence might be offensive to some people. He is given a back-story involving early abuse, deformity, and retardation. I'm surprised that advocates for various challenged groups don't protest that easy equation between retardation and mania. I thought such stereotypes had been put to rest a long time ago. In the same vein, I'm surprised that West Virginia citizens never protested the ""Backwoods"" movie franchise dealing with savage inbred clans of subhuman mountain dwellers.

First off, the dialogue is horrendous and the actors delivering it are horrible.  There are no likeable characters.  There is nothing to care about in the entire film's running time.  Second, what the heck was up with the sets?  Ninety-five percent of the film is set outdoors and never for a moment do you believe that they are outside.  Everything looks like a set.  It looks exactly like the actors are in a swimming pool surrounded by plastic plants.  Pathetic.  Third,  the killer AKA Victor Crowley just wasn't that interesting.  I found his makeup to be pretty crappy looking.

The basic plot is that a group of strangers find themselves taking a ""haunted"" swamp tour in the murky wilderness of New Orleans. The group also includes a ""girls gone wild"" character who is using his video camera to film two girls being playfully naughty on the trip - excellent humour here.

The find themselves stranded on the murky swamps and have to save themselves from the reincarnation of a deformed man who was accidentally killed by his father many years in the past.

The film has some excellent frights, including parts that actually made me jump in my seat, which is rare for me in a horror movie. The gore is intense at times with blood splattering across the screen and splashing against trees of the bayou. The camera work on the action sequences is really well done - you'll find out in the documentary that they used a steadycam for the majority of the shooting - very impressive.

Will the group be able to save themselves from the mutant???

The disc also includes a pretty funny gag reel, and an excellent (and lengthy) featurette of the making of the movie which is well worth viewing to learn about the director/producers, and see some interviews with the cast.

The  film then took a bad turn.  It tried to be funny.  But it wasn't.  I didn't laugh.  `Shawn of the Dead' was a spoof, a good one, that made me laugh.  Hatchet needed to make up its mind to be a spoof or a serious slasher flick.  Either go for the joke-jugular, or be scary.

Unlike the 'Scream' movies, no victim was done away in any `spoofy' ways.  If they had, it would have certified Hatchet's 'spoofiness', and at the same time been a truly imaginative homage to both slasher pics and the 'Scream' spoofs.

The special effects were lame, too.  Red syrup pumping out of beheaded torsos, and rubbery mannikins being ripped to bloody shreds.  'Evil Dead' looked like 'Avatar' compared to this.

The monster/slayer was trite and predictable---not alive, not dead, but not a ghost either.  Copying Jason and Michael Meyers, he took a lickin' and kept on tickin', stunned when shot or burned or pitchforked, then reviving in time to grab the girl's ankle.

Worst of all he didn't have that trademark gimmick (e.g., coveralls, hockey mask or long, razor-sharp finger knives) that the big-time slashers have.  He was just ugly and doofus-looking and wore a plaid flannel shirt. Yawn.

The ending was awful, like they just ran out of film.

What disappointed me most was the hatchet used by the slayer was a double-headed woodsman's axehead on too-small a handle.  They didn't even use a proper hatchet.",1204588800,9,1946,4.614035087719298

I wanted to like Hatchet, I felt I could like Hatchet, except for one thing. It's a comedy and it doesn't try to hide it. Old school horror was not trying to be funny on purpose. If this movie had just taken itself with a grain of seriousness I might have enjoyed it, but I laughed for half the movie.

3064933,2,B0011FLM00,"Hallelujah, it's raining Men!

Oh, and women too. Literally.

Pity poor, monstrous, ruined, bloodthirsty Victor Crowley (the great Kane Hodder, channeling Eric Stoltz from ""Mask""): born into this cruel and grasping age looking for all the world like a pig with Down's Syndrome stuck by a mad scientist into a combination blender/teleporter with the little unwanted mutant baby from ""Eraserhead"".

Born into this! Yes, Born into this!, as Bukowski once said. And then smacked in the face with a hatchet because he had a really bad case of ADHD (they parented differently back then, spare the rod and all).

Supposedly he's dead, but the Cajun fishermen tell tales of hearing him cry out for this father from the ruins of their little abandoned cabin up in the cypress swamps on a moonless night.

""Hatchet"" bills itself as ""old school American horror"", and its eye-catching publicity posters (and DVD art) promised as much: the starkness of the hatchet front and center, its stony, unyielding surface smeared with sticky red blood, a primal sigil of destruction, all sharp, hard, brutal lethality contrasted against a backdrop of inky night.

That might suggest simplicity, starkness, perhaps raw terror, to you. It might suggest raw, primal grue. Perhaps a stripped down screenplay, a kind of rippling, insurgent savagery and, Hell, mebbe even a scare or two. You might be forgiven for thinking this was something new, something revolutionary; I did.

We would be wrong.

""Hatchet"" is to Scary what a palace eunuch is to Macho. It is a deeply, deeply stupid movie, that manages to 1) take the relatively simple horror movie chore---deliver the boneheaded cardboard characters to the swampy anvil of death---and transform it into an hour of painfully contrived, brain-blasting tedium; 2) squander the talents of horror vets Robert Englund and Tony Todd in scenes both tedious and cringingly unfunny. The first hour of ""Hatchet"" is the cinematic equivalent of injecting yourself into ""Flowers for Algernon"": you can just feel yourself getting stupider.

But once the psycho fodder hits the swampy turf---& the resident Psycho (played to beefy, uh, perfection bybeefy psycho vet Kane Hodder) shows up to, er, bury the Hatchet---things get redder, and goopier, and gorier.

You're missing nothing if you just FF to the goods: the sheer, unapologetic brutality of the flick (chick! hiya! chick, meet drill sander!), and the generous helpings of the goopy red stuff, at which it's pretty much by the numbers & on the bounce: psycho fodder shriekds, runs and hides. Mutant freak finds, slices, and dices. Rinse, repeat.

Bottom line: all the marks I take away for the sheer blain-blasting stupidity of this thing, I must restore for sheer enthusiasm. Sheer, wild-eyed, gore & brain splattered exuberance counts for a lot in jihad, porn, and horror movies, and Adam Green delivers it in spades once his monster shows up with his own rendition of the Big Easy.

If nothing else, it's worth checking out just to see what amounts to a fully ambulatory, totally ripped Elephant Man in overalls come bounding down a bridle path, hatchet in hand rendered teeny by the Beast's gigantism, and give a little Tomahawk Chop right to the ol' shoulder-blade of some shrieking geezer. And what a Chop!

Anyway for all the goop and gore, this film also has a great message. Three of them, in fact:

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #1: if it's raining in New Olreans and all the levee done broke and we got no place to go, brotha, they's worse places to be (like in da Hootchee swamp with a hatchet wielding maniac out).

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #2: There are worse things in Louisiana than Katrina, FEMA, and gators.

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #3: When you were a kid did ya get hit with the Ugly Stick? Get even---get a sharper one and hit back!

Even worse, are two hysterical, screaming, crying actresses who are supposed to be along for the ride because they're being filmed as part of a porno movie.

They race into the darkness where the killer dwells, the black guy runs up a tree for safety and I think we're supposed to laugh. The killer is a real downer.

One word BEN aka Joel Moore. your ""leading man"" role is supposed to be likable, your supposed to root for him, hope he survives the chaos. I kept waiting for him to get killed next so I could actually enjoy watching the rest of the movie. It ruined the whole movie for me. He goes agsinst everything your lead character is supposed to be.

3064944,3,B0011FLM00,"Let's see. The first thing in ""Hatchet"" is Robert Englund playing ""Paw"" to his son in a swamp, delivering homophobic dialog and being a pipe smoking slack jawed mouth breathing redneck. Son needs to pee, really really bad. Daddy calls him gay slur. Both get killed. Cue Marilyn Manson song. Things don't get much better afterwards.

Giving this three stars is generous. After the pathetic set-up, the homage to 80's slasher films kicks in. The usual crew of characters (nerdy lovelorn guy, token wisecracking African American, a pair of slutty chicks and a few other assorted pieces of meat) get lost in a swamp where it was illegal to be in the first place. Hot chick Mary Beth (Tamara Feldman) is revealed to be on the tour boat because she is looking for ""Paw"" and her brother - and it seems the redneck idiot gene bypassed her in the uterus. It is Mary Beth who explains the curse of Victor Crowley (another 80's horror vet, Kane Hodder), who then starts picking off the tourists in grizzly manners.

However, for viewers immunized to CGI-torture gross-outs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turistas/dp/B000N3AW6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turistas</a>, the gallons of ketchup, grape jelly and chocolate syrup air-pressure sprayed throughout ""Hatchet"" will seem lame. It is where I actually gave ""Hatchet"" the benefit of the doubt, because they made a serious effort to do old-school scary by spending most of their minuscule budget on latex body doubles to hack and fake blood in copious amounts instead of relying on animated computer effects to dub it in later. The bodies are used exploitively, especially the Mardis Gras bead slinging scenes at the beginning. Bad comic lines are thrown about (mainly by Dean Richmond as Marcus, who gets all the 'token' Chris Tucker/Chris Rock type jokes). It makes ""Hatchet"" a movie made by horror-movie geeks that tries valiantly to match the 70's and 80's movies they must have lapped up as film-school nerds, even if they regurgitated a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;script with no form other than function and some foul stereotypes for characters.

After all, even a monster has to have a reason to go slicing up pretty girls with power tools. Victor Crowley just is a kid who misses his daddy and then kills anyone who gets on his turf. You never really find out why he kills; he's just one angry dude in a roided out Elephant Man costume. The film scoots along predictably, and the two kids you pretty much guess will survive do so. The twist is nice but obvious at the end, and of course there is talk on the extras and commentaries about ""Hatchet 2."" Maybe these guys will get a budget slightly greater than borrowing their friends' credit cards. Or maybe someone like Rob Zombie (whose&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Rejects/dp/B000AXWHSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Rejects</a>&nbsp;shows the kiddies how to do homage the right way) will take Director Adam Green under their wing and give him some pointers on character development.

3064945,4,B0011FLM00,"I found this movie to be totally enjoyable, on a number of levels. I don't know if it classifies as a horror/comedy- it's a slasher flick with humor in it. And the humor in it is hilarious. Adam Green, the writer/ director, and all of the cast did an excellent job at getting both laughs and screams. And the characters were individuals who were portrayed sympathetically, unlike the cookie-cutter characters typical of teen slasher flicks. The killings were extremely inventive, and the gore effects were wonderful. The monster, Victor Crowley, is a cool movie monster who I have a feeling we will be seeing more of. The photography and visual effects were beautiful.

The plot is pretty simple: a group of 8 (not all teens) are in New Orleans and decide to go on a ""haunted swamp boat tour"". The boat sinks, and the group finds themselves stranded in the swamp with a hatchet-wielding maniac. Predictably, they get knocked off one by one, although nothing else is that predictable. Horror fans will be thrilled to see Robert Englund, Tony Todd, and Kane Hodder in the movie. The funniest dialogue may come from the two ""bimbos"", who are supposedly making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" style video with an older, sleazy photographer.

If the purpose that you are trying to accomplish is different, you can't really compare it to movies like ""Halloween"", ""The Descent"", or ""Saw"".

The movie does not, as others have noted, have a good balance between the comedy and the horror. I think in most any horror movie you need a little comic relief to break the tension so you can take a breath. This flick attempts too much comedy interspersed with the horror. 5 minutes of scrapped humor in the script would have made a world of difference.

Overall though it was a fairly tolerable movie and I would have gladly pulled cables on the set for free just to watch the process unfold. The ripped head shot was excellent and my definite favorite of the kills.

It definitely delivers on the gore and the sudden scares. It delivers a little bit of sleaze with all the boob shots in New Orleans and also between our two naive female characters shooting for Hollywood.

If you are looking for a marvelous revamping of the genre then this might disappoint you. If you are in the 35 and over crowd looking for the type of movie that you grew up with,lots of physical horror effects and no CGI, with then this is a excellent revisit of the era albeit a little cheesey.

The back blurb says it is a comedy/horror. It is not. This is supposed to be serious. I saw no comedy in it at all.

3064952,3,B0011FLM00,"This film clearly had great potential, but failed to live up to the hype.  I rented HATCHET solely due to its highly aggressive marketing campaign, in which numerous reviewers gushed about how HATCHET was the best film they'd seen in years.  Okay, I guess that means it won't suck, right?  After watching it, though, I felt betrayed, resentful, and wanted my $4 back.

After 24 hours had passed, I deigned to view the special features . . . which, surprisingly, were better than the film itself, and allowed me to feel sympathy and compassion for the cast and crew, who really came across as likeable, talented, and professional.  There's no way I can bring myself to berate such nice people even after viewing this sub-par film; so, after some reflection, my review is as follows:

HATCHET started out strong -- first, the brutal murders of the idiot fishermen; followed by a number of outstanding shots in the recreation of ""Mardi Gras"" filmed on location on Bourbon Street.  Unfortunately, the film rapidly goes downhill from there.  The screenplay was quite possibly the worst that I'd ever been subjected to, with plot holes, continuity errors, technical errors, credibility errors, ineptitude, and general suckitude -- the story made no sense whatsoever, and compelled fellow audience members to shout abusive comments and fling various food products at the screen . . . making this a TOP CHOICE for selection by the likes of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  This screenplay DESERVES heaps of abusive criticism -- so long as said criticism is done in a humorous manner and contributes to further ""enjoyment"" of the film.  Awful, awful writing.

That being said, the casting was brilliant, and the acting was quite good.  Huge kudos to Kane Hodder for utilizing PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE techniques against the unfortunate cast to terrorize them FOR REAL so that their on-screen ""fear"" was not an act.  He is an innovator as well as a creative genius, and you really must see the special features on this disc to appreciate this fact.

The ""monster"" costume Hodder wore was well made, allowing us to actually see the monster numerous times throughout the film.  The f/x were very good, with the exception of the actual blood itself.  The blood being sprayed around seemed far too thin, light, and watery . . . they really should've experimented with a variety of formulas as well as dispersion methods.  While a few scenes were dead-on, others looked incredibly cheesey and fake.

I do acknowledge that this was apparently a ""homage"" as well as a ""spoof"" of classic 80's slasher flicks . . . but I did not realize this upon renting it.  ""Old School American Horror"" is not the phrase I would've chosen to market what is clearly a spoof film, and I rightfully feel misled by that prominent tagline.

I always watch the credits at the end, and wish that some credit would've been given to at least a dozen of the more prominent ""Mardi Gras"" revelers, who did more than the average ""extra"" and in a few cases were given their own exclusive shot.  It is a shame that these fine folks (many of whom were crew members or even producers) were uncredited, while the 3 kids with no lines standing around for 5 seconds with Halloween masks got their names in the credits.

Is Victor Crowley a zombie?  How did he transform from malnourished fearful retard with a head injury to lumbering psychopathic powerlifter?  Was it really Victor Crowley, or some sort of mutant space alien?  And how can he still sprint, swing an axe, throw people around, and hold his breath while swimming underwater after having been shot in the chest with a .45 ACP slug, stabbed, chopped, burned, and impaled?  Did victor Crowley have a secret stash of Quik Clot and methamphetamine?  This was an INCREDIBLY STUPID MOVIE . . . but it did have its good points.

My advice would be to watch the special features FIRST, then view the film with the commentary track running.  If you just start watching the movie cold, expecting the ""Old School Slasher Film"" it was relentlessly hyped as being, you are guaranteed to be disappointed.  This was a fairly good spoof of said slasher films, though.",1200787200,,4157,4.805907172995781

But on the other hand, the plot makes this movie highly forgettable. It will not stand beside the classics it was trying to pay homage to.

Sounds serious, but the campiness of the setting and the actors provide an almost light-hearted mood until our villain makes one of his many nasty appearances. There are a number of good jump scares, remarkably well done gore scenes, and some gunuinely funny moments with a cast that would largely be found in the extras of any other flick. I especially liked the chemistry of the two primary characters, Ben and Marcus, who maintain enough witty dialogue to keep any slow moments more than tolerable.
There is absolutely no reason to take this movie seriously, and to critique it in such a way would take all the fun out of it. It's a homage to many a slasher flick, and manages to mimic much of what we find good and atrocious about the genre. It doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should we. It moves at a quick pace, with nary a dull moment, and includes cameos by Robert Englund and Tony Todd, appropriate enough considering their over the top dialogue fits deliciously with the theme of the movie.",1200787200,2,1178,4.641148325358851

The story is simple enough, a group of tourists on a New Orleans Haunted Swamp tour end up lost in the woods with hatchet wielding maniac. What sets ""Hatchet"" apart from others in the genre is it's sense of humor. This probably the first slasher comedy. It's not a spoof however, there are some moments where you'll find yourself jumping and the gore level is high. Overall I liked the movie, it's bloody, it's gory, the plot has been used a hundred times, but it's fun.
 The disc also has several documentaries about the film with the filmmakers. Among them is the story of how 80's hair band Twisted Sister lead singer Dee Snider plays into the whole making of the movie.

the killer is one Victor Crowley. born with various deformities all over his body, he grew up secluded in his home with his father. that is, until the day some local kids accidentally start a fire in the house. Victor's father accidentally killed him with a hatchet while trying to get through the door to save him. now he wanders those same woods and swamps looking to dish out some pain in return for his own.

starts off with a relatively traditional horror intro (you know what im talking about)

cut to a couple days later. the main character(""villain"" from Grandma's Boy! also in Accepted) of this movie is highly unhappy at Mardi Gras and looks into a haunted swamp tour for some alternative entertainment. most of the characters are fairly cliched. you got the paris hiltonish girls (eh), the hero, the token back dude, the sensitive guy, the completely helpless old couple, and the sleaze. traditionally, it doesnt take too long for the chaos to begin.

a fairly over-used formula at this point, but just like ""The Tripper"", ""Hatchet"" manages to be supremely entertaining with an extremely interesting kill or two thrown in for good measure. plenty of blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan, but probably not grisly enough for the most jaded of gore hounds. kills with nothing but bare hands, kills with the ominous hatchet, and a power tool may even just get thrown in there. the action does not disappoint. while i didn't find it genuinely scarey at any moment (they hardly ever are), you feel a little tension at times, it has very satisfying death sequences(victor can be so creative!) and some surprisingly good humor, its an extremely entertaining horror movie. recommended to fans of the genre, especially slasher fans. most others won't get it.",1200614400,23,2136,4.843835616438356

You are supposed to want the main characters (good guys) to win in horror movies.  You are supposed to want them to win, or at least live, because they have been portrayed as someone you can relate to or would like in real life; you are supposed to feel empathy.

The first couple of minutes and the last were too formula for me but the rest shined.  As I watched entrails flash onscreen in the beginning, I thought here's just another cheesy slasher film.  But then it did something wonderful, it became original.

Yeah, it has five college buddies in Mardi Gras with girls flashing their boobs for beads but it gets better quick.  One of them (suffering from a broken heart) decides to go on this spooky swamp tour and his best bud decides to go along with him.  Their first attempt at booking a swamp tour is hilarious.  The Voodoo Shop owner tells them he no longer does night tours because of the ""Accident"".  The two guys as well as the viewer expect one thing but get another.  This sets the tone for the movie, it does not always go as expected, and I loved it.  They finally find a night swamp tour and set out for the adventure along with an older couple who are the typical tourists, some guy filming two girls that flash their breasts on cue (think ""girls gone wild""), and a loner chick.  Most actors are recognizable from tv show stints.

The tour guide is inept and the boat soon gets in trouble.  Here we learn about the local legend, Victor Crowley, who was a deformed child taken care of by his father in a shack by the swamp.  The movie provides a good solid boogieman for the audience.  The legend is that if you go near the house at night, Victor comes back to life and gets you.  Let the gorefest start as the group gets stuck in the swampland.  Be prepared for a lot of gore but not as disturbing as say, Hostel or Saw.

Also, the writing and acting is stellar as long as you get it (HINT:  it's a spoof folks).  Halfway through the body count, they decide to fight back instead of being picked off one by one.  I don't want to give specifics and ruin the deviations from the genre, but it makes for good viewing.  Then the ending comes and its back to formula I'm afraid.  I subtracted one star for the very beginning and end but everything else was spectacular for this type of movie.  I don't get the unrated tag though, this film is no different from other ""R"" rated horror movies out there.  Perhaps this was a marketing tactic?",1200441600,5,2286,4.347517730496454

Add in excessive gore with poor special effects, and sprinkle in enough excuses for frequent full frontal female nudity.  Voila, you've got the clich&eacute; 80s horror movie.  A lot of those movies were bad enough to make you laugh.  Hatchet is different because the director wanted us to laugh at how bad it is.

Those who can appreciate spoof movies or bad movies that are unintentionally funny will find a lot to enjoy here.  If you also like gore, even better.  Still, if you're looking for a movie that is either a horror classic or a movie masterpiece, you will find yourself scratching your head and missing the point.  Watch this alone and the critical lens of intelligence may cloud your view.  But watch this with a group and before long you are bound to be laughing hysterically between disgusted ""ooohs.""

Acting and Direction

The acting is at times good and sometimes really bad, yet it is all done intentionally to throw you off and remind you what a spoof this is.  The direction is even more off-putting, with uncomfortable close-ups and some moments that leave you thinking, ""why didn't they get another take?""  Still after a while you realize that too was done on purpose.  Anybody who was a fan of Ed Wood will understand this.

The Story

For this movie, the director creates the legend of Victor Crowley, a New Orleans youth who returns from the dead seeking blood and revenge. Some dumb tourists decide to take a swamp tour at a really bad time, and you can probably guess what happens next.

The simple silly story is meant to be a throwback to 80s horror, but they throw in lots of horny tweens, a forced love-interest story, and plenty of nudity to round out the clich&eacute;s.  The sprinkled-in one-liners are usually funny enough to give you a chuckle once you catch on.

DVD Extras

The special features make this DVD, and might have a longer running time than the actual movie if watched back to back. There are 5 special features. The ""Making Of"" feature is probably the best.  It goes way beyond the usual filler that comes with DVDs.  It actually includes useful information that aspiring spoof film makers could learn from and use.  You know, the stuff DVD extras are supposed to include.

""Meeting Victor Crowley"" is about the actor who plays Crowley, Kane Hodder.  He is one of the three actors with parts in the film who has a history as a horror icon.

The very sloppy special effects are explored in the ""Guts & Gore"" feature.  Similarly, ""Anatomy of a Kill"" explores shooting one of the movie's kill sequences. Finally, ""A Twisted Tale"" is completely out of left field.  It explores the director's obsession with Twisted Sister. Beyond that there are the DVD extra standards, such as a Gag Reel and director's commentary.

Conclusion

Overall, this is a fun and entertaining movie. This one is best watched with a group of like minded people who can suspend the use of their brains and just enjoy.  Aspiring film-makers and fans of Ed Wood will find owning the DVD worthwhile for the extras.

And you have to admit, ""Hatchet"" never pretends to be anything it's not -- a horror movie in the classic slasher vein, with lots of blood and dismemberment. Adam Green doesn't do anything we haven't seen before, but he does it with such gleeful enjoyment. And gloriously satirical dialogue (""Your nipples are dumb!"").

A bunch of guys are at Mardi Gras, enjoying the beer, beads and breasts. Ben (Joel Moore) is depressed about a recent breakup, so he decides to drag his pal Marcus (Deon Richmond) on a haunted boat trip. Since the main guides no longer do night tours, Ben and Marcus end up on a tiny boat with two dumb tourists, two softcore porn actresses, their ""producer,"" and a mystery girl with a gun.

But then the newbie guide accidentally runs them into a rock, and they run afoul of gaters. And then Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) reveals the horrifying truth -- she's there to find her brother and father, who vanished in this same swamp. Supposedly it's haunted by the ghost of Victor Crowley, a horribly deformed boy who was accidentally killed by his father during a fire.

Of course, nobody buys this until a grotesque creature comes jumping out of the old Crowley house and hacks up the tourists with a hatchet. Terrified, the people go running through the woods, with Victor hot in pursuit -- and their only hope of escape is to get back to New Orleans. But how can they escape someone who cannot be killed?

Again, this has all been done before -- think ""Halloween"" meets ""Friday the 13th,"" with dashes of other horror classics thrown in there. But you know, that's good -- Green is just trying to make a funny, gory, entertaining horror movie without pretensions. And no, the black guy and the slut are not the first ones to die (just for your info).

The first half of the movie is basically buildup and murky bayou atmosphere. Then Victor starts dismembering people, and from then on it's all about people running around shrieking, and getting killed off one by one. That would be a bit boring after awhile, but Green keeps it interesting by throwing in a few twists -- and the last scene will make you hide under your bed.

Along the way, we have ripped-off heads, chainsaw murders, buckets of gore, and lots of gruesome deaths shown in bloody detail. But to keep things from ever getting too serious, there's some bleak comedy (including Marcus' gradual fall from a tree). Most of it comes from the feuding porn girls (""Are you sure the number is 911?""), but there are some priceless lines from other characters (""He fell into the water... hit his head... and... SUED ME FOR NEGLIGENCE! That C***SUCKER!"").

All the actors do nice solid jobs in their roles -- Moore is a likable nice guy who inexplicably keeps his head in a crisis, and Richmond is fun as the guy who REALLY didn't want to go on this. Feldman really rules the story as the feisty, grim love interest, but all the actors are good -- and Mercedes McNab and Joleigh Fioreavanti are a riot.

As for the bad guy? Well, Kane Hodder (aka Jason Vorhees) makes a wonderfully grotesque slasher villain, looking like an orc with a hunchback. Given his backstory, you'd feel sorry for the guy if he weren't trying to carve everyone into lunch meat. And note to horror geeks -- keep an eye out for Tony Todd/Candyman, playing a very POed ""Reverend Zombie.""

""Hatchet"" is all unpretentious gore and dismemberment -- and hilarious love note to classic slasher horror. Funny, crazy, and not terribly complex.",1200441600,12,3624,4.675039246467818

Naked women abound, profanity is the status quo, and the dumb blonde heroine is the funniest character in the ensemble cast. Overall, the movie is so so. But if you like camp, go ahead and watch it. Don't go into it hoping for an amazing movie, because it isn't. The best part of this movie is seeing actors like Rudy's friend from the Cosby Show, the guy who played the Candyman, and--of course--Freddy Krueger all joined in this C-list thriller.

 The film splices together an original story, some good performances, and an all-star production group that makes this film pop from the start. Robert Englund is there mainly as star bait, since he is gone inside of a few minutes, but it is the disappearance of his character that drives one side of the film story. In true Robert Englund form, he has one of the most extravagant deaths. From there, the story is mostly Comedy, Characters, and ( alternating almost) some incredibly creative deaths FX/Gags in recent Cinema. Supposedly the Director did not want any CGI in the Deaths, but he admits in the commentary to using CGI
for rain, so how do we know ?
 Anyways, Kane Hodder plays an awesomely brutal Character that the Director allegedly dreamed up at Age 8. As one would expect with a ""low Budget"" film, Kane plays the Father of Victor, as well as the Grown Victor( Kane Hodder is an established Actor having some Great roles in WISHMASTER, and at least one of the later Jason Films). It is never stated if Victor is a Supernatural being or what, since the story says Victor was Killed at a young Age. Anyways, Splice in a little Tony
Todd Flamboyance, some Sensual elements( Hardly Eye-popping nudity), and this film is a solid proof that an unrated film is the Defacto gold Standard in any film genre.

The Extras include a breakdown of a FX  Shot where a womans
head is  ""affected"" ( if you know DEMON KNIGHT, 1995 film, you already have a Good Idea of the FX, but maybe not how it was done; the similarities are surprising); anyway, no detraction from the Gag here, since the effect of the FX is different, especially the way Kane performs it.
 I would not be surprised if a sequel is spawned, since Kane Hodder and the Production group make this Horror work well; Now, for my money, I'd like to see a Big Supernatural element arise.",1200441600,3,2388,4.465596330275229
3064965,4,B0011FLM00,"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip that started from this bayou port aboard this tiny ship. The guide was a mighty stupid man; the hero was sullen and depressed. Nine passengers set sail that night for a haunted bayou tour, for spirit and ghouls.

The weather started to rain, the tiny ship was stuck. If not for the courage of the hard to get chick the tourist would be sunk, the tourist would be gator food.

The passengers set ground on the shore of this deserted haunted house with the dude from Dodgeball, The Token Black Guy too, an old dude and his wife, the wannabe movie star the pornographer and the chick from Angel, here in the movie Hatchet.

Hatchet bills itself as ""not a remake, it's not a sequel, and it's not based on a Japanese one. Old school American horror."" The problem with old school American horror is that it was basically destroyed by the Scream franchise that let everyone in on the rules of the genre. But Hatchet doesn't care if you know the rules, if fact you can pretty much guess the death order once the ship sets sail. It is more about the character that have no problem to crack one-liners even as some deformed dude bears down on them and killing them is some outrageous ways which are more Mortal Combat than Saw.

The movie has a horror pedigree having Freddy Krueger, Candyman, and Jason Voorhees (at least the dude who played him four of the eleven (?) times) all making appearances in the movie. The movie is far from perfect, you can't help but think of Mask when you first see the killer and the ending is frustrating in a The Sopranos, did my power just go out, kind of way. But Hatchet is one of the more enjoyable horror movies of the past decade.",1200441600,2,1729,4.3602484472049685
3064966,4,B0011FLM00,"""Old fashioned"" may be a relative term regarding horror movies, of whom I count myself a fan. But it gets harder and harder to find something I can really watch; unlike a lotta newbies to the genre, I really don't want to find the most bloody and realistic depiction of chainsaw massacres.

I like horror movies that surprise, that are clever, that are pure escapism. The worst and most horrific blood and gore isn't my idea of a horror movie. That's just stupid, or maybe I should say adolescent (which is why it's adolescent boys who constantly yammer for more and more.)

Hatchet is made for folks like me: people who remember when going to a horror movie was FUN, and not just an exercise in blood and gore.

Don't get me wrong, though. There's plenty of blood and gore in Hatchet, but it's the fake kind, and yeah, that's on purpose. The liner notes (so to speak) say this movie was created as a paen to 80s-type horror movies, and that is definitely true.

But Adam Green, the writer and director, wanted to make a movie that would be an updated version of 80s-style slashfests. He succeeded admirably.

The movie is just fun. One of the rules of these type of movies is that anyone who has sex is gonna GET it. And yeah, they do. There are two slutty chicks, one a Valley girl, and the other a faux NYU acting school graduate with pretensions of ""art"" who are making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" soft porn movie with a sleazy director. There is the boring older couple, constantly invoking the name of Jayzus; the requisite black guy with great expressions; a Chinese or Korean or Filipino guy (our token Asian) who also pretends to be a Cajun tour guide; and the hero, the resident geek.

The heroine is a plucky southern chick, combing the swamp for her white trash daddy and brother (parts filled respectively with 80s horror icon Robert Englund, otherwise known as Freddie from Nightmare on Elm Street and Joshua Leonard, the guy whose teeth turned up in a bag of rags and twigs in 'Blair Witch Project.')

Hatchet is cliche-ridden, and freaking funny and fun as hell. The extras with this DVD are fun, too (which is amazing, since it's so rare to get DVD extras that actually are as good as the movie!)

Of course the boy has grown into the killer and proceeds to attack them.  The only thing different between this and Friday the 13th is that the killer doesn't wait until they're alone to attack.

hatchet isn't a horrible movie, and if you've never seen ""Friday the 13th"" you might enjoy it.  But for everyone else it will just seem like a cheap rip-off that doesn't add anything to the original story.",1200441600,3,1030,5.300613496932515
3064968,2,B0011FLM00,"In short, Hatchet is your typical amateur slasher flick, with a superhuman, ugly bad guy chasing and killing annoying teenagers (for no good reason). By the way, ""annoying teenagers"" might be the understatement of the year when it comes to this film. Adam green (writer and director) was trying to go back to the old style horror flicks of the 1980's, but this movie seems so typical of our contemporary horror films (with hot chicks and ridiculous violence/gore).

Hatchet is real amateur (straight to video) stuff. For example, the movie opens up showing a mardi-gras parade, but there is no parade and only about 50 extras. However, a couple good actors such as Tony Todd (from the Night of the living dead, REMAKE) appear briefly in the film.

The most enjoyable part of this DVD is the extras. I enjoyed Adam Greens story about meeting Dee Snyder. I also enjoyed his commentary with the other actors. You can tell he is a nice guy with a lot of passion for making movies.

Unbeknownst to the others, however, is that one attractive, young passenger is taking the tour with an ulterior motive. She is on a mission to discover what has happened to her missing father and brother, both of whom disappeared while alligator hunting two nights before. All she has to go on though, is the local legend of Victor Crowley, a malformed creature seeking revenge on humanity for the cruelty that led to his accidental death as a child and that of his heartbroken father.

""Hatchet"" is a pretty cut and dry slasher tale that has received some overly gracious hype. A group of boat tour passengers and their guide get lost in the outdoors and are viciously murdered one by one. It's an enjoyable ride for the most part. The cast list is pretty impressive, even if the bigger names are just cameos. Those people you may not know by name have a pretty strong resume to back them up and do a great job onscreen. The New Orleans/Louisiana swamp locales are a neat, new setting, and yes, there are some boobs here and there too. I wouldn't exactly call it nudity for nudity's sake. Considering the Mari Gras setting, that's just part of it. Getting to see that much more of Mercedes McNabb of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" fame is a bonus. However, if you're thinking of picking this up just for things like that, there's not that much of it and it's just some ""Girls Gone Wild"" spoof style flashing, nothing more. The real stars of this film though, were the gory and creative death scenes. Now, while I'm a big horror fan, I'm not much of a gorehound, and though some may feel these scenes weren't real looking enough, they were real enough to make me squeamish. If the thought of heads being twisted off or a girl being defaced with a belt sander appeals to you, you'll dig this. And props to the filmmakers for not using any CGI in this picture!

So, why do I feel this movie isn't quite as dazzling as some of the hype might lead you to believe? Well, for one, like so many recent horror films of this nature, the ending doesn't really feel like an ending. I realize they are coming out with a sequel, but jeez, these sudden stops in horror films these days just aren't satisfying. On top of that, I never really heard any explanation as to why Victor Crowley was back from the dead. I guess this is a tribute to the lack of explanation we got for Jason's immortality in the Friday the 13th series, but I didn't like it then either. Also, there really wasn't anything special about this story to set it apart from other slasher films and make it really stand out. It might be slightly better than others thanks to the humorous lead-in and the cast, and the creative new deaths, but there wasn't anything strikingly special in the very basic plot or anything like that. On a lesser complaint, the comedy, which is skillfully kept separate from the horror/violence, is rather hit and miss. I would also have to say that the bickering between McNabb's and Joleigh Fioreavanti's ditzy actress characters, which was supposed to be comic relief, came off as too annoying for my tastes.

The Unrated Director's Cut DVD of ""Hatchet"" looks great and is loaded with extras, making it a very worthwhile purchase if you are a fan or just curious and free with your spending. As I said, it's an enjoyable film for the most part and deserving of one viewing at least. I don't think most horror fans or gorehounds would regret a blind-buy. The extras include a great audio commentary with the director Adam Green, Cinematographer Will Barratt, and the three lead stars (Joel David Moore, Tamara Feldman, and Deon Richmond), an excellent making of featurette, an in-depth look at one of the most interesting death scenes, two other behind-the-scenes featurettes (all the featurette stuff includes great interview and behind-the-scenes footage), a gag reel, trailer, and touching story of how Twisted Sister made this movie happen.",1200182400,,4475,4.633501259445844
3064972,2,B0011FLM00,"I'm a fan of slasher horror films. I've loved them since I was a kid, and I carry that love into adulthood. This is a genre with few true gems but a great deal of fun, popcorn fare.

First of all, let me offer some props to the director for avoiding the more modern torture horror and trying to get back to some more traditional (dare I use that word in relation to this type of movie???) horror themes. You have just about everything here: An awesome soundtrack, gratuitous nudity that adds nothing to the story, a misunderstood mutant seeking some sort of vengeance or turf protection, a group of wise-cracking, oblivious fun seekers destined for demise, the crazy old hermit coot (played excellently by John Carl Buechler) who tries to warn the know-it-all youngsters (and, in this case, some middle-aged tourists as well), the cautious local who knows the truth, blood and gore and over-the-top violence, and a bumbling but sweet hero. If the movie also had gratuitous teenage sex scenes played alongside the gore and horror, it would be following the recipe for a slasher film.

However, I kept wanting a bit more from this story. It's one thing to pay homage to the greats, but an entirely different thing to take it further and create something unique. That doesn't happen here. Green names his anti-hero mutant after the infamous Aleister Crowley, which might be more befitting of an actual monster rather than the sympathetic character he seemed to want to create. Not one of the characters seems to be really surprised or scared that they are in the middle of a blood fest; Marcus is perhaps the only character who understands that the entire situation is crazy, but he is played with bug-eyed terror for pure comic effect. I cringed in embarrassment for Mercedes McNab; I imagine she owed someone a favor or hasn't had much luck getting more decent character actress roles (as die-hard Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans, both my husband and I were dumbfounded to see Harmony jiggling her goodies for a few cheap scenes).

Green says in the 40-minute ""Making of..."" feature that an 8-year-old thought of this story. That is endearing, but I would hope that the story could be a little more honed 20+ years down the line.

Surprisingly where this DVD shines is in the extra features. I typically either don't watch the extras or skim through them once. However, the commentary with Adam Green, Will Barrett, and a few members of the cast as well as the ""Making of"" feature and ""A Twisted Tale"" really show that Green has a true passion for this genre. Getting this film from the page to the screen truly was a labor of love. The extra features changed my ho-hum attitude toward the film to something with much more interest and appreciation.

Oh, and about those special features? You might want to skip the short Gag Reel. ""Gag"" here is not a euphamism for funny or for blooper. Gag means gag.

Another thing that came out of the Commentary is that there were many scenes that were cut for the theatrical release of Hatchet. I'm astounded because, first of all, there is nothing in there that is any less horrifying than in Saw or Hostel, etc. Secondly, without the gorier scenes, I can't imagine that this movie makes much sense. It would just be a bunch of young people running through a swamp being chased by a crazy mutant.

Highlight of the film: The music playing while the group heads out for the doomed swamp tour is some of the most inspired and funniest music I've heard in a horror film in a long while. In fact, I really liked the music throughout the film, and Marilyn Manson is featured in the credits with a song that's perfect for the slasher genre. Another highlight? I had some true laugh-out-loud moments while watching this. And one more highlight for good measure: The special effects for this low budget flick are actually pretty good. I think Green did a great job of finding people who are good at what they do and respecting them enough to let them do it.

So, if you and some friends are looking for a slasher rental, this isn't such a bad DVD to pick up. But don't watch it expecting true horror or even a throwback to the early Nightmare, Friday the 13th, or Halloween days. As a comedy this is a decent little rental. As horror? It leaves its audience wanting something meatier.",1200182400,6,4313,4.628758169934641
3064973,5,B0011FLM00,"""Hatchet"" is everything that horror used to be in the 80's.
So naturally it reminded me of being a kid again.
And as a result...I loved it.

Remember when horror was fun??
When curvey chics unabashedly flashed the camera like every other scene.
Remember loving the bad guy??
When each death scene was something you looked foward to.
When each death scene was a gorey vision to behold
Well this flick has got it all,
Bad jokes, Lovable/Hatable characters, Fake [...], & Vicious death scenes,
I mean really freakin' vicious death scenes.
(I love when that guy gets cut from shoulder to waist)
(And who could forget the instant classic; belt sander to the face)

What's even better is that this flick never once takes itself seriously.
It knows who its influences are. (He!! they're in the movie)
It knows the tongue in cheek joke they've all become.
And it runs with that joke.
What's wrong with having a good time every so often??
I don't want my every slasher flick to be serious.
(But when they are, I want them to be ""Murder Set Pieces: DC"" serious)
I wanna laugh and cheer sometimes.
I want my main-character to be the villian,
And I wanna watch with glee as the buffons get slaughtered.
One by clueless one.
But hey, that's just me.

If you really like this flick, try ""Wrong Turn 2"" (if you haven't already)

3064977,2,B0011FLM00,"I LOVE cheesy bad horror movies, but HATE horror movies trying to be bad.  This ends up being just plain bad, in a bad way.

I am being generous with two stars and this is due to the behind the scenes feature included. This segment was head over heels (literally) better than the movie itself.  There was a passion in the filmmakers, and a clear camaraderie with the cast, but it just never hits the intended mark.

The only notable cast are the veteran character actors Richard Riehle and Patrika Darbo, but they should leave this off their resume.  And Joel Moore is treated to his first lead role.

First of all, it's easier to think of the cast as a mix of Gilligan's Island and Lost... seriously.  You have Gilligan (mixed with a little Shaggy from Scooby Doo) and Skipper (token black guy) partying in New Orleans, but Gilligan just broke up with his girlfriend, and would prefer to leave the T&A (not much to speak of) and go on a three hour swamp tour.  Of course!

We meet the flip-side of Jin Kwon (who is the token Asian with a really bad dialect) and he will be our tour guide.  Then the Professor (porn producer), Ginger (porn actress), MaryAnn (porn actress), Mr. and Mrs. Howell, and then which might as well be Kate Austen.

The Director pulled strings to get cameos by the actors that played real Freddie, Candyman, Jason and a Blair Witch victim.  Don't blink.

Of course the tour guide crashes the boat, and they are stuck on the swampland.  Jason in an Elephant Man suit attacks everyone.  No suspense.  No scariness.  No plot.  Plenty of poor gore.

3064982,2,B0011FLM00,"This ""homage"" to the eighties ""slasher"" flick tries hard but falls a little flat for several reasons. Firstly this is 2007, not 1980 and what would have been huge back then (this film has no shortage of both gore and inventive murder scenes) is just not that exciting. Secondly, a cast of veritable ""nobodies"" which would have not mattered back then, (and arguably was essential) doesn't bring any extra style to the picture, which is predictable and almost laughable in places. Thirdly, today's moviegoer could be considered spoiled with high def special effects, celebrity cameos getting killed in a grisly fashion, and generally more polished feel to even low budget horror flicks, but when the bar is set at that level, you must be at least in the same area.
It seems that today's generation of fans of this type of movie (think the Saw franchise for example) want a little more intellectual stimulation than just in your face gore.
This isn't complete bilge (as the two stars denote) and has some extremely nasty on screen moments, or few jumps and (as I assume) was intended leads the viewer down a familiar path with the victims, and delivers accordingly.
However, even if the genre remains loosely the same today as 25 odd years ago, at least there are usually a few more twists and turns in a modern horror, or some genuine suspense through creative scripting, and good casting. Hatchet unfortunately lacks both.",1199923200,3,1421,4.851851851851852

3064985,3,B0011FLM00,"There's nothing in ""Hatchet"" that you haven't seen before.  Instead of spam in a cabin, the meat in this movie is spam on a boat and then in a swamp.  At least we get a better idea of the characters in this movie before they get killed than in much of the genre.

However, director Adam Green does two things that really set ""Hatchet"" apart, and that more new filmmakers should do.  First, Green hired experienced actors who know what they're doing, and gets out of their way.  You won't recognize any of the names on the DVD box, but you'll recognize most of the actors as ""hey, it's that guy!"" once you start watching.  A simple search on IMDB shows that most of the actors have worked a lot prior to this movie.  Their professionalism shows, and really goes a long way toward making this a decent movie.  Second, Green didn't go over the magic 90 minute mark.  In most genres, for most stories, once the movie breaks 90 minutes it becomes a tedious mess.  ""Hatchet"" weighs in at an economical 84 minutes, as I recall - not long enough to wear out its welcome or get bogged down in useless subplots.

On the downside, the monster is more sympathetic than monster-y.  Green talks about how he wanted to create a monster you'd root for.  But I didn't really root for him in the sense of wanting him to rack up a body count; the victims didn't do anything to deserve to die.  As my wife said, you root for him as a person, but the monster ultimately just makes you kind of sad.

Copious extras will appeal to anyone who's interested in how low-budget movies get made by starting directors.  ""Hatchet"" is worth at least a rent by horror and low-budget movie fans.",1199664000,,1661,4.39672131147541

Hatchet is certain to satiate the appetite.  The only purpose of this movie is to display the slicing and dicing of a gaggle of characters with an array of devices and it admirably succeeds in meeting the objective, however my attention span is not that short.

I prefer psychological horror and my leisure time is both limited and precious so this subset of the horror genre falls on the periphery of my interests yet for those who gravitate in that direction, it is not difficult to see how it could service as 90 minutes of fun.

What you have is a specious reason for a bunch of people to travel to a locale where they might serve as sacrificial lambs to the movie's malevolent force, the hideously deformed but tragically sympathetic Victor Crowley. In consideration of the hackneyed dialogue and distractingly over the top performances, I wanted all of the characters bludgeoned and the sooner the better. While it was clear certain scenes and exchanges were intended as humorous interludes, in the main I found them lacking. If it was intended as a parody of the most noticeable offerings of the category like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Friday the Thirteenth, I think it may have been an over-ambitious effort.

It's not even ""Saturday the 14th.""

Second: the makers would also have you believe that this is an homage to the grand old horror franchises. It's not that either. Though it does feature some of the actors (mostly in cameos).

This is a low-to-mid-budget, poorly scripted, mostly poorly acted gore film with pretensions. How Patrika Darbo & Mercedes McNab got talked into this, I will never know. Maybe their house needed a new waterheater or something.

It most closely resembles the films made by slasher fans turned film students. The effects are all fine for what they are: ""gee-golly look what we can do!"" They don't look realistic, just (in places) spectacular. There is one good startle moment and a couple good jokes.

The movie doesn't necessarily rise above any of the cliches or tries to be ""Scream"", but it embraces them and just tries to have old fashioned fun. The story?. A bunch of people in New Orleans go on a haunted boat tour in the swamp. This particular swamp is home to Victor Crowley(Kane Hodder, from Friday The 13th fame), a deformed being who gets anyone who comes near his old home. Simple enough. Our unlucky passengers get stranded in the swamp and learn that the Victor Crowley legend is no story...he's real and he's out to get them. Like I said earlier, real basic, but then it's supposed to be. Victor's intended victims are a hodepodge of characters we have seen make up a killer's death list in countless other horror films. Even tho none of these characters are new, each one has their own personality, individuality, and most of the actors are pretty good in their parts. The characters are cliched, for sure, but you just may find yourself liking most of them, and actually wanting them to make it out alive. When was the last time a slasher movie did that?. The most familiar of the bunch is probably Mercedes McNab, best known for her role as Harmony on both ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"". She is basically doing a variation of that dim bulb character here, but she does dumb blonde well. As for Victor Crowley himself, he is a big, nasty looking monster, and he basically just does what he does. Not much else going on there. And since this is a loving tribute to a certain time and type of horror movie, it is not surprising to see some familiar faces here. Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, appears in the opening minutes, and Tony""Candyman"" Todd has a funny little cameo in town. The movie is also pretty funny, and most of the humor is spot on and funny. But what about the gore?. The gore and mayhem is out of this world. If that's what you love, then you won't be disappointed. It's over the top, and in your face. The special effects, gore, and death scenes/make-up are really well done. The movie is not short on the red stuff. In the end, Hatchet is not the second coming of horror like so many other places have said, nor is Victor Crowley the next heavyweight icon of horror, but the movie IS a well made hack-a-thon that's fun and entertaining. The gore and blood factor is high, the death scenes are something else, the humor is welcomed, and you have characters that you just might not want to see just be fodder for Mr. Crowley.

Yep, that's here too!), really slick production values(considering the budget), and an overall vibe of not taking itself too seriously throughout(plus for the fella's... boobies galore!).  Definitely more than a little over hyped(it's not THAT fantastic or memorable but...), the movie should still provide some fun entertainment for most Horror fans(especially Slasher buffs) new and old alike.",1199059200,3,1421,5.481651376146789
3065004,5,B0011FLM00,"For my holiday session, my therapist decided we should sit down in his office and watch the DVD movie Hatchet together.  85 minutes later and I felt like all of my stress and personal demons were no more.  In this movie I was able to displace all of my woes onto poor Victor Crowley, the deformed child who was teased, burned, and accidentally chopped in the head with his daddy's hatchet.

Clearly Victor Crowley is a metaphor for all of us who at one time or another have been mocked and ridiculed and had our swamp cabin invaded by outsiders.  Sure society and the Bible tells us that we should merely turn the other cheek but with Victor as a role model it's clear that sometimes it may be just to simply grab an intruder and twist their head around 360 degrees...so in a sense they turn the other cheek (ha).  I shed several tears for Victor Crowley who clearly just needed a hug but instead got people urinating on his property, stealing his tools, and vandalizing his neighboring graveyard.

When the movie was finished my therapist asked me what I had learned from Hatchet.  I told him, ""Sometimes you've just got to let the axe do the talking for you.""  He said I was cured.

Thank you Victor Crowley.  Thank you very much.",1198972800,3,1232,4.459821428571429

3065008,4,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is one of those films that comes along and either makes an impact or leaves people high and dry. Amongst its film festival circuit, it was well received. It got a very short, very limited theatrical run. Finally, 2 years after its birth, Hatchet hit DVD, and the story of Victor Crowley is here for everyone.

 Hatchet is the small story about Victor Crowley, a disfigured young man who was supposedly accidentally killed by his dad as a child, and returns to his shed and woods whenever anyone has the audacity to pass through his woods. A group of tourists happen upon his woods, and Crowley takes care of them.

 This seems like a simple plot that didn't need much brains to come up with it, right? Well, right, but that's what makes this movie such a little gem to me. It has been called a throwback to the eighties, and that it was. The horros of the eighties never had much of a storyline. They just gave its killer a small motive, threw in a bunch of teens, gore, and nudity, and off went the movie. This is how Hatchet was done. What makes it set from the rest is that it was obvious that the director, cast, and crew behind this film are fans of the genre. They attempted to give the hardcore horror fan viewer everything they could want, and succeeded.

 There are truly insane kills. Two of our ladies constantly give boob shots. Our characters are one-dimensional, stereo-types ... but the kind that we begin to sort of like based on the personalities given. We are set in the labyrinth woods of New Orleans where it's dark and wet and nasty. And we are given one of the better recent horror maniacs to date. That is Victor Crowley who is portrayed by none other than Jason 7-X himself, Kane Hodder.

 I originally wanted to see this film for Mercedes McNab. I must confess that I am a fan of hers thanks to her character of Harmony on Buffy & Angel. Then the horror movie sites that I visit constantly began to praise and adore this film. More reviews kept popping up on the net so whenever I was able, I was going to check this film out. Living on the SC/NC stateline, a theater never played Hatchet during its small run. I had to wait until the DVD came out to see it. I was there the first day it was out, and purchased it, and watched it that night. I loved it. I loved Mercedes McNab. And I loved Hatchet.

 It wasn't until I watched the special features on the disc that I grew a major appreciation for Hatchet. There are 5 featurettes.

 The first is a Making Of. This isn't some silly little 10 minutes ""making of"" that we see on a lot of DVDs these days. This is almost an hour's worth of start to finish production diaries along with cast & crew interviews and neat little background stories on the film.

 ""Meeting Victor Crowley"" is an introduction to Kane Hodder and the maniac he portrays in Hatchet. My favorite part of the bonuses is in here as Kane - dressed as Victor - plays a practical joke on an unsuspecting Mercedes McNab.

 ""Guts & Gore"" is just a small little diddy on the plethora of guts and gore effects that went on. I am proud to say that the people behind Hatcher are very proud to say that they did not use one ounce of CG on the effects they created. And the effects look awesome.

 ""Anatomy of a Kill"" details one of the film's most ridicolous kills from concept to film. A neat addition is viewing the scene from three different point of views: before cut, after cut, with actual actor, and with prop.

 ""A Twisted Tale"" is about director, Adam Green's, love for Twisted Sister.

 There's also a Gag Reel that isn't much, and the audio commentary which I have yet to get to but should be completely worth it.

 Hatchet is truly a dedication to the genre thanks to Adam Green and his creation of the Victor Crowley story. Many times during the featurettes he gives little insight on what a sequel would be like, and I hope that he gets to make that sequel. Hollywood needs more like Adam Green.",1198800000,3,3949,4.356070941336971

Bad casting... Bad Dialoge... and even bad storyline.  Nothing happenes in this film for the first hour or so.  Then we get to see the deformed monster and then we get a hand full of boring dialoge and then another kill scene by the deformed monster.  I gave it one star just because the monster is the only cool part about the movie.  Its to bad everything else was boring.

Soon the boat runs aground and the tourists soon run afoul of a grotesque looking maniac who picks them off one at at time sometimes two at a time. The maniac is Victor Crowley a deformed youth who is accidentally ""killed"" by his father with a hatchet blow to the face. Hence the title of the movie since the maniacs method of killing his victims is to literally tear them apart including one victims' face torn apart.

This film has no high aspirations other than to show trapped victims being slaughtered in increasingly gross ways and in this respect the movie is a complete success.  Well done for this type of movie but be warned the blood and guts, the dismembered limbs, and the heads go flying about in wild abandon.

3065033,4,B0011FLM00,"Well, at least I feel a hundred times better about picking
this one up than I do about Halloween '07!

This was fun. Simple, brainless fun. There is nothing
ground-breaking here, a horror story you've seen over and
over again, but it sticks out much more. Very interesting
kills that I haven't quite seen before. The ""no CGI"" rule
here is a pleasant surprise, especially to a fan like me
who lived when there was no CGI available in the first
place.

I'll admit this movie isn't perfect, it has flaws. Victor
Crowley's look is odd. I kept wondered if the makers
of the 1980 movie ""The Elephant Man"" would eventually
sue, his look is that close. And even though the mix
of humor and horror was very well distributed, it did tend
to lead itself dangerously close to ""Scream/Scary Movie""
territory, a place that I don't want to visit during a film
with gore effects to be taken seriously, but luckily like I said,
it was at a good level. Also, the lead was played by
Joel David Moore, a six-foot plus looking geek that I first
saw as the Matrix-obsessed game programmer in the comedy
""Grandma's Boy"", and that was hard for me to shake at times,
this kid truly reeks of second-banana geek, not horror film
leading man. And what about ""The Sorpranos"" like ending?
Good...bad? I'm still not sure....

Anyway, I got the exclusive 2-Disc edition. All it really
has is the unrated disc and the R-rated one in one keepcase with a leaf, so if you bought either version of the movie, your disc is in it. And what's the difference between the cuts? 31 seconds. Seriously...but that half minute does make a heck of a difference.

To an old-school fan of Friday The 13th, Halloween, and countless other slasher films of the 80's, this brought back great memories and earns to be beside them in my collection.

When I think of Old School American Horror three movies instantly come to mind -- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Dawn of the Dead (1978), and Halloween (1978). This movie did not have the feel of any of these films. Those 3 films are all either very creepy or very disturbing and at times both.

Now I don't know if I should really compare Hatchet to these three films, but when you advertise your film as Old School American Horror, these are the comparisons that are going to get made. The main difference in Hatchet over these films is that I never really felt the menace from the Victor Crowley character that I felt from the characters in those films. Mike Meyers and Leatherface are scary and disturbed characters that are very unsettling to watch on film as are the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. Victor Crowly, though, did not ever feel menacing to me.",1193443200,8,1016,4.516304347826087

I was hoping this was going to be at least a CRAVEN'S HILLS

The first scene of Robert(ROBBIE! You Rule)Englund and a friend
in the Bayou was GREAT! Now we get the EERIE titles to HAUNTING
music you ask...No! Manson music???  O.K. I'm still hanging in there
we now are in N.O. Louisiana and the main star does not want to
spend his time watching girls GO WILD! He wants to take this HORROR
tour on a boat fair enough except that the guy with the black hat
giving the tour was so irritating that I wanted to take a HATCHET

with the personality of a dried up ......!  The tourist finally
come up to the Crowley house where all the sudden OUT COMES VICTOR??
It was like WHAT WAS THAT!  Here I am! No suspense No nothing!
So Victor hacks up a man in half(very cool I might add,though very
fake as well)and rips the mouth open of the Hacked-mans wife(very
C.G.I. I might add) The rest of the group leave in sec. and understandably so. However when they have calmed down is when this movie
really COMES DOWN for we get a lot of stupid humor for the next 45 min

at HORROR and REALLY bad at comedy.  I do not mind comedy in HORROR
if you watch real hard you will see that all the HORROR films you love
will have it in there and was that purposely put it there can be great
like RE-ANIMATOR-CEMETARY MAN-DEAD ALIVE-EVIL DEAD and RETURN of the

3299054,4,B0011FLM00,"I have to believe that ""Hatchet"" is a parody. No one in their right mind could have believed that a film so ridiculous could ever be taken seriously; everything about it is consistently hokey, from the acting to the plot to the dialogue to the sense of humor to the abundant horror movie clichs. It had to be intentional for this movie to be so bad. Because I believe this to be true, I'll take a risk--a really big risk--and give it four stars. I say this because it's either one of the worst slasher films ever made, or it's a clever satire that knew how to point at itself and laugh. I'd like to think that it falls under the latter category. Given the content, I find it impossible to believe that the filmmakers actually wanted to make a reputable movie. Consider cameo appearances by Tony ""Candyman"" Todd and Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund, and keep in mind that the killer is played by Kane ""Jason Voorhees"" Hodder. Has my point been made clear?

Make no mistake--a definite case can be made for how genuinely bad ""Hatchet"" is. In no way is it believable, intelligent, or even remotely original. The thing is, I think that was the idea all along: it exists on the same mindless level that made early teen slasher films like ""Friday the 13th"" so popular. It's all about idiotic people wandering into idiotic situations and dying in idiotic ways. We get gory makeup effects that are anything but special. We get the usual gathering of mismatched, annoying characters. We get the sex-crazed side characters. We get naked breasts. And yes, we get the hideously deformed monster wielding various weapons, including a hatchet. No thought is required for this film, and in that sense, it works.

In what's clearly paying homage to the horror films of the late 1970s and early 1980s, ""Hatchet"" tells the story of a tour gone wrong in the remote swamps of New Orleans. Hoping to escape the furor of Mardi Gras and reminders of his ex-girlfriend, college student Ben (Joel David Moore) decides to go on a Haunted Swamp tour. Joining him is his friend, Marcus (Deon Richmond), a.k.a., the sex-crazed side character. Along the way, they meet a perverted cameraman (Joel Murray), a ridiculously wholesome older couple (Richard Riehle and Patrika Darbo), and a pair of quarreling bimbos (Joleigh Fioreavanti and Mercedes McNab) who regularly expose their chests for the cameraman. One of them is blonde; I make note of that because, as the stereotype suggests, she's an absolute moron.

Leading the tour is a phony voodoo shop owner (Parry Shen), a man who, as Marcus aptly remarks, ""is like Uncle Remus meets Bruce Lee."" He clearly has no idea what he's doing; not only does he board everyone on a ramshackle motorboat with a rusty engine, he also has to rely on index cards for vital bits of information. What kind of information, you ask? How about the legend of Victor Crowley? Crowley, who was born deformed, lived with his father in the middle of the swamp, avoiding the world as much as he could. On a Halloween night many years ago, a group of teenagers tried to scare Crowley outside by throwing firecrackers at his house. They only succeeded in burning it. Mr. Crowley tried but failed to save his son, and he later died of heartbreak. It was soon established that the swamp was haunted, and it's remained so ever since; they say that, if you listen carefully, you can still hear the ghost of Crowley calling for his father....

And that's pretty much when the bodies start piling up. Has the ghost of Victor Crowley come back for revenge? Did he even die in the fire? Do these questions matter? Anyone familiar with the conventions of slasher films will know exactly what to expect from ""Hatchet,"" which can be viewed in one of two ways: this movie is either a rehash of a rehash of a rehash, or it's trying to poke fun at the genre it stems from. I prefer the second viewpoint because I just know this film is supposed to be an inside joke. This is especially true of Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), a character of mixed horror movie personality types--she's the Bold Heroine, the Girl with a Secret, and the Distant But Reachable Love Interest all rolled into one. She joined the tour only to find her father and brother, who went missing when alligator hunting in the swamp. When Crowley begins killing, her knowledge of the legend makes her the leader of the remaining group. And as you might have guessed, Ben finds her attractive.

If this were any other movie, namely a serious movie, it would no doubt be one of the worst of recent memory. As a parody, it at least informs the audience of what it wants to accomplish, and it does so fairly early on. It would be easy--too easy--to condemn ""Hatchet"" for being predictable, derivative, disgusting, and of poor quality. But a film this unabashedly tasteless should be given some credit. This movie is not frightening by any means, and the filmmakers must have known that all along. It's bad because I think it chooses to be, and that allows us to have a good time watching it. If a film of depth and complexity is what you're looking for ... but no, you're not. If you were, I seriously doubt you would have bothered to read this review.",1191542400,13,5191,4.631921824104235

I also watched this entirely blindly as I had never seen a single preview nor had I read anything about this movie prior to having seen it.  In so many ways this movie blew me away from start to finish.

The story/plot for the uninitiated:  The movie focuses on a group of college buddies going to New Orleans to celebrate Mardi Gras.  Of them is our main character Ben(Joel David Moore, Avatar, Spiral) and his best friend Marcus(Deon Richmond, Not Another Teen Movie, Kenny aka BUD from tv's The Cosby Show).  Ben went with his friends to New Orleans so that he could have some fun while getting over his recent break up with his girlfriend of 8 years.  Once Ben finds that he just can't seem to get over his break up and thus can't seem to enjoy Mardi Gras, Ben tells Marcus that he had been told of a late night swamp tour by some friends.  Marcus hesitant at first to join Ben eventually agrees to and after some walking they first try to get a night swamp tour from Rev. Zombie(the Final Destination series, the Candyman trilogy).  Unfortunately due to an accident and a lawsuit, Rev. Zombie could no longer do night tours.  Rev. Zombie then tells Ben and Marcus about them another place to go.  As soon as they get there they soon meet the owner and tour guide Shawn.  After ignoring any warnings from crazy fisherman Jack Cracker, the group soldiers on down the swamp.  Once the boat breaks on a rock, they all find that they have much bigger problems than alligators and swamp gases as people from the tour group start disappearing mysteriously.

In this movie you meet some colorful characters that ride the boat swamp tour along with Ben and Marcus:
-First there's Shawn the highly charismatic Asian tour guide with a Cajun accent and alot of wit.
-Doug Shapiro a freelance porn director.
-Misty and Jenna 2 gorgeous and very sexy porn stars that work for Mr. Shapiro.
-Jim and Shannon a good two shoes elderly married couple from Minnesota.
- Finally:Marybeth a beautiful yet decidedly less-than-social, highly mysterious, and terribly crabby young woman.

The cinematography in this movie is beautiful and well shot.  While the night shots are a little bit hard to make out, overall there are plenty of well lit night shots to be enjoyed.

The kill scenes are beautifully executed heralding back to anything awesome that Savini or Baker would have created.  By that I mean that the old school gore is very impressive and still manages to look amazingly realistic.  Also that the limitless ways that people are killed is just astounding.

The chase scenes are both scary and highly riveting keeping you guessing as to who will make it and who will be butchered.

The music proved catchy and playful at times and seriously dark and wicked other times.

The nudity was plenty(partly thanks to the Mardi Gras scenes) and showcased some gorgeous bodies as all get out.

Victor Crowley is freakishly ugly, freaky, menacing, violent and murderous without any reservations or conscience, and just like so many slasher serial killers before him proves close to impossible to stop and to kill.  That is most everything that we have all come to expect from a slasher icon.

The humor is silly camp is also very welcome and enjoyable.  Deon ""Kenny"" Richmond(Marcus) and Parry Shen(Shawn) both bring the hilarity and silliness full circle. Mercedes McNab(Misty) proves gorgeous, smokin' hot, and yes funny with her ditzy one-liners and neurotic reactions to things.  Also there is an occasional bit of hilarious banter between Joel David Moore(Ben) and Deon Richmond.  Other than that Robert Englund and Joshua Leonard both have hysterically funny cameos.

All in all, if you love a good slasher, like I do, don't mind rough and graphic scenes of gore, love well crafted and realistic practical gore, love good jokes to take the edge off and lighten things up some, enjoy campy yet fun stereotypes, enjoy great female nudity, want to see a somewhat different kind of killer, love great shots of New Orleans and swampy lands, and above want some shocking scares, then this movie totally has you in mind.  A must see!!!  10 stars out of 10!!!",1506297600,,4368,4.707894736842105

I had a smile almost all the way through and lol'ed a few times. It's definitely hitting more of the comedy side of the house rather than any real horror scare tactics. The acting was very good, surprisingly. The chemistry between the entire cast REALLY just worked. The black guy and white guy stereotype wasn't really there (good thing). If anything the black guy really stole a lot of the scenes...he needs more roles! Him and the brunette were great together.
Anyway, a really fun movie, great dialogue and cast ( an Asian Cajun tour guide..love it!)",1504224000,,703,4.818181818181818

3299138,3,B0011FLM00,"When you get a movie called ""Hatchet"" I am pretty sure you know what you are in for, if not, you made a boo-boo. Standard but a little more fun type of movie to see how many people we can kill in 84 minutes. Once you see the characters (stock types all) you can figure out who goes when. Not really any likable characters at all but still has fun, seems likes the budget was the same as my last supermarket trip. Don't get me wrong I stayed through the whole thing and was somewhat entertained. But as always the same survivors always happen. So lost points for that typical crap. And please someone have the ladies actually shed a tear when they cry.....what is that dry crying?",1462752000,,679,4.3125

3299140,5,B0011FLM00,Great movie. A lot of gory action. It's an awesome slasher film.,1458691200,,64,4.416666666666667
3299141,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet makes no apologies about what it is. Ever self-aware, the movie is advertised as ""Old-school American horror"" and that's more or less what you get. Hatchet is obviously  going for a retro '80s slasher film feel, complete with your quintessential disfigured villain, gore and bad acting. A lot of it has been done: its swamp setting, the deformed villain, but it's fine, Hatchet embraces it all. Besides, what else could you have possibly expected?

You know you're in for some legit old-school horror when your cast features Kane Hodder as the main villain and an appearance by Robert Englund no less. I loved the first sequence starring the ever reliable Englund, it gives the story a strong setting and it's great to see him on our screens again.

One of the best sequences of Hatchet is without a doubt the retelling of Victor Crowley's backstory. I know, it's not very original, but it's effective and gives off a classic vibe. It has the makings of one of the great horror icons and would make Jason Vorhees proud.

In a nutshell, Victor Crowley was born grossly deformed as a child. This leads to his dad to keep him under lock and key shielding him away from other children. In a Halloween prank gone wrong, Crowley is accidentally killed and now he haunts the swamps where he died. Crowley's story is interesting, and although somewhat reminiscent of other horror films and borrows from Friday the 13's, it stand strong enough on it's own.

The story? Ahh! of course, a few individuals think it's a good idea to go on a haunted tour where legends of Crowley are whispered... And you can probably figure out the rest of the story.

The character of Victor Crowley is a good old classic, pissed-off villain. Kane Hodder has proven himself time after time and in Hatchet he shines once more, playing to perfection the part of the mammoth and nightmare of a man that is Crowley.

I can't say the same of the other characters and their largely forgettable stories. Hatchet abides largely by horror stereotypes: the sweet old couple, the crook, the two dumb wannabe porn-actress, the strong female, the scared/funny black guy.

The kills are solid and would've been right at home in a '80s Slasher flick, which is what they intended and were going for. The death scenes are not overly clich'd and some  are very creative -at least in comparison to modern horror- others are rather to the point and very effective.

I won't spoil it but I thought Hatchet ended a little abruptly. The ending was little lacking and unsatisfying, it certainly could have ended on a higher note. Otherwise, if you're looking for a fun retro '80s slash-fest and some old-school horror you could do worse.

I remember a lot of hype around this film upon it's release. It doesn't quite live up to the hype as Hatchet fails to be all it tries to be, but it keeps you entertained and managed two sequels. The character of Victor Crowley, his story and the gore are top notch, it's the rest that's not quite up to par. Not a terrible movie, in many ways it's decent horror. Just don't expect too much. 3 & 1/2 stars.",1457049600,,3099,4.6471663619744055
3299142,4,B0011FLM00,"One of my friends recommended this movie, and I am so glad she did. If you love some of the classic slasher movies you will most likely enjoy this gore fest.

The lighting  was unimaginative illuminating almost the entire set in what is supposed to be a densely wooded swamp.  They show the killer fully lighted, full body the very first time he appears.  This is a sloppy homage, but I could've been okay with it if the film had any kind of ending.  I mean show bodies dropping and a boat rowing away...anything really.  As much as I like seeing Robert Englund, Tony Todd and Kane Hodder, I have a feeling if they sacrificed having one they could've afforded an ending",1413331200,,796,4.524475524475524

3299268,4,B0011FLM00,"Ok let me start by saying that when i first saw this movie i didn't think it was that great,but then my buddy hooked me up with Hatchet 2 and the story seemed to get really interesting & deeper than what we get told in the first movie. So that being said i re-watched the first Hatchet,and i was impressed.
Okay so the story is this,some people in NOLA were looking to kill some time,and seeings how Mardi Gras wasn't doing the trick for the head guy in the movie(i forget his damn name,but you get introduced to him in the beginning with his friends on Bourbon St.)
So they go tooling around and they get deep into the NOLA streets,then come across Reverend Zombie's house of horror(played by Tony Todd) and he tells em about a swamp tour. So they go to find the tour boat,with as random cast of expendable characters. The acting is a little shapeless when it comes to some of the acting by characters like the 2 strippers & that old guys wife(i really dig the work that the old guy does,i just forgot his name too)
They take a tourboat down to Victor Crowley's swamp......
Your asking ""who's Victor Crowley? Well he was that sub-human creature kid that lived in the swamp with his dad(played by none other than Kane Hodder & Kane Hodder plays the all grown up ghost monster that is Victor Crowley)in the beginning you meet Rob Englund & his son. Well they are hunting for alligators in the swamp because nobody is supposed to be in that swamp cuz they all know better. In town the legend of Voctor Crowley is that he lives in those swamps,so nobody goes there. Well Englund & son go down to get gators from an unscathed part of the swamp(mistake)and then the intro credits roll. Then you meet the guys who decided to take a trip down and get on the tour boat. Now lets get right into it,the toiur is a scam set up by Reverend Zombie(Tony Todd) to make cash. The tour boat slams into a bog and then they have to abandon ship and walk through the swamp to get to a road. Along the way they meet a fisherman saying go back go back,Victor Crowley. The tour guide cracks me up,he plays the same part in the 2nd movie. But he plays the tour guide's twin brother Justin(that kid is funny)So they all get killed pretty much,in a fast set em up & knock em down fashion. Once they know the killer is there he takes them all out simultaneously. The kills are pretty good in here(the kills are 10x more brutal in #2) but the head twist is sick,i dig when the old man and his wife get taken out. I think they are the best ones in the movie,but don't worry old man Cracker' gets it in the second movie. Along the movie there is a sublining that creates more depth in the second movie. So now you know the movie is a trilogy which is pretty cool because the story gets deeper and more eerie as they progress. There is a girl on the boat Marybeth who is searching for her father and brother who got taken out in the beginning of the movie,but at the end you'll see what i mean on how it just ends...
But the second movie picks up literally on that same frame that it ended on,and the story progresses into trilogy magic. This is their first attemp on the movie,solid introduction  and solid story,great gore and violence. 4/5*stars for me. Parts 2 & 3 of Hatchet are both 5 Star movies. I recommend them all to you.

This movie is a huge was of time and money. Don't rent it, buy it or waste your time watching a even a free version of it.",1399248000,,274,3.6610169491525424
3299270,1,B0011FLM00,"You know that urban legend about the person who goes to a party and wakes up the next morning in a tub of ice with a kidney missing? Or the even cruder one about the college kid who wakes up every morning feeling...sore...and eventually discovers chloroform and Vaseline under his roommate's bed?

Multiply those feelings about ten times and that's what I experienced after watching HATCHET. This movie bills itself as ""classic American horror."" Well, I think the movie was made in America, so that part of the claim is probably true. Classic? In a sense, yes: Adam Green has created a classic -- a classic piece of s***. Horror? Absolutely. I was absolutely horrified that I squandered two hours of precious life watching this shovelful of flaming Bantha-poodoo. This movie SUCKS. It's TERRIBLE. In fact I'd rather watch two hours of gritty 8mm film featuring flies crawling over a dung-heap than see this again. And they made sequels!

HATCHET opens with a father-son team of bayou bumpkins foolishly deciding to go into a supposedly haunted stretch of swamp to go fishing. Haunted by whom, you ask? Why, Victor Crowley, of course; the resident deformed, undead maniac whose favorite weapon is not a hatchet at all but a belt-sander (evidently the Louisiana power company provides free service to run down shacks in the middle of the swamp, allowing Mr. Crowley to recharge his deadly home-improvement implements during his leisure hours). After the inevitable slaughter which follows, the movie shifts to a trio of college students in New Orleans for Mardi Gras. They decide to take a ""haunted boat tour"" occupied by the usual cast of horror-movie fodder, which, thanks to a badly-timed rainstorm, ends up stranding the boat in Mr. Crowley's neighborhood. I could keep going, but since you already know what's going to happen from then to the credits, why bother?

Adam Green deserves a certain unwelcome credit for this movie. He manages to assemble a group of horror vets which includes Robert Englund, Richard Riehle, Tony Todd, Mercedes McNabb and, of course, Kane Hodder...and make a film which does not contain a single frightening moment. There's gore, of course -- buckets of blood and eyeballs and torn-off jaws -- and numerous shots of McNabb's boobs, and the requisite flashbacks to the origin story of Crowely, and even a chase-scene through graveyard; but none of it works or even comes close to working, because Green evidently didn't know that he was making a horror film. In fact, he seems to have thought he was shooting an MTV-style rip-off of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER with a lot more gore and a lot s***tier writing (and Mercedes McNabb for street cred). But by constantly striving for cheap locker-room/Spring break type comedy, he annihilates all horror elements and turns the flick into a comedy gone soggy with Red Dye No. 5.

To make matters worse -- yes, it gets worse -- by attempting to resurrect the slasher movies of the 80s (or rip them off), Green has instead s*** upon their memory, making an unintentional satire of all the things that made ""don't go in the woods"" flicks scary in the first place. Whatever agenda this movie had, it failed miserably. It's as much a pastiche of F-13 type movies as SCREAM was, without any of the cleverness; it's as much a horror-comedy as BUFFY (the series) was, without any of the subtlety, character development or balance between horror and comedy. Part of me wonders whether the whole thing wasn't a colossal in-joke at the expense of all horror movies shot between 1979 and about 1993...and yet even as an in-joke it fails on a historic level.

HATCHET has exactly one virtue. It exists as a sort of unintentional blueprint of how NOT to make a horror film, a horror-omedy, or really, any type of movie at all. They ought to burn every copy of it save one, which should be shown once a year at film schools worldwide as a cautionary tale on the power of a terrible idea. The Crypt Keeper could drag his bony butt out of retirement and give a lecture beforehand, telling the hapless students that it was no use running, the doors of the theater have been locked!

There are differences in structure and plot but a lot of the movie is the same.

The main thing that was good was the cast chemistry, they all acted, I felt, realisticlly (yet seterotyped) and when it came to it they were far more willing to take action then most slasher film casts. Also I like how this killer didn't seem to have a prefered style of killing, it used multiple weapons and appeared to be a combination of Jason and Michael (Jasons deforms and Michaels intellagence). Also the pace didn't feel slow.

On the contrary, what Hatchet lacks in the scare department it makes up for with comedy, and the end result is a not-half-bad film. The story is hokey, sometimes deliberately so, and the actors dramatize quite a bit, but most of the glaring ""flaws"" in Hatchet are intentional. The incredibly exaggerated gore is proof enough of this.

Some other pertinent information for potential viewers/purchasers:

1. The monster is not original and actually reminded me of the goon from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funhouse/dp/B00023P4SS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funhouse</a>.
2. Don't bother watching Hatchet if you hate when main characters act really, really stupid, especially after danger strikes.
3. There's no sex, but there are plenty of boobs! (The film opens with a streetside view of Mardi Gras)
4. GORE. Exaggerated and ridiculous gore.

Writer/director Adam Green successfully brings us a spoofy horror that pays homage to the Gods of 80s slasher movies.  While only cusping the outright horror comedy (e.g., Shaun of the Dead) or the more twisted slapstick approach (a la Evil Dead 2 or Dead-Alive), the humor is frequent and undeniable and the epic hatchetry (yup, just made that word up--please feel free to spread it like wildfire!) deserves a blood-soaked grin of approval.  This reminds me more of the farcical approaches of Piranha 3D, The Hazing and Tucker and Dale vs Evil.

A group of mostly twenty-somethings take a trip to a much cleaner and far more sober-looking New Orleans than I've ever seen.  They decide to go on a haunted swamp tour (led by a horrendously accented Parry Shen; The Hazing/Dead Scared) and find themselves stranded in the wilderness.

Ben (Joel David Moore)is the more sincere character whom we expect to survive this movie.  He's interested in fellow tour-goer Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), who us suspiciously quiet and reclusive as if she's on the tour with very different, more serious motives than simply having a fun night.  She reveals that this swamp belongs to the horribly disfigured Victor Crowley and basically tells the other tour-goers Crowley's ""origin story.""  He looks like The Goonies' Sloth and teenage Jason Voorhees had a lovechild--pretty much like one of the Wrong Turn hillbillies--and he loves to kill.

Bringing us laughs and T n A, Doug (Joel Murray) is working on a low budget Girls Gone Wild: Girls of Mardi Gras video with two airheaded rivals Misty (Mercedes McNab) and Jenna (Joleigh Fioravanti).  They're always reminding us they don't like each other by criticizing their on-camera performances.  ""Your woo is so not in the moment.""  ""Yeah, well your nipples are dumb!""

Once they find themselves in Victor Crowley's territory there's head-twisting, impalement, lower jaw-tearing, creative use of a grinder as dental equipment, loads of dismemberment, a bloody ""death sneeze"" to the face, diagonal torso cleaving (points for difficulty!), a gross case of mouth-to-mouth drooling and someone even gets hit in the head with a severed head; and the overall gore-slathered action comes at a very healthy pace.  Piles of rubber guts, limbs and organs being forcibly sundered and yanked from their bodies, and buckets of blood being flung in front of the camera all contribute to the fun of this movie.  Cameos by Robert Englund and Tony Todd round out the satisfaction for horror fans.  The sets and acting all seem a little fake, but not ""bad"" fake.  It all fits nicely with this more jesting approach to horror.

The killer (Kane Hodder) literally pops up out of nowhere between our victims mid-conversation like an over-sized hillbilly mutant ninja.  It's stupid as sin, but I laughed...after all, it was hilarious.  Clearly, this is a nod to 80s killers' legendary ability to vanish and then teleport the moment their victims' take their eyes off of them for even a second.

The use of cheep special effects and lame kill scenes. Hatchet II did not seem to be quite as blatant, but not by much.
The concept of the story is ok, but the execution I can't begin to explain except to say they try everything in the book and then some. We have the standard horror story where the older people get killed first, then the perv, and then one of the cat fighting girls and the the dumb blonde or vise versa and last but not least we are left with the budding romance of the unrealistic couple to do battle.
The kill scenes are way over done and unrealistic and I think that they did this intentionally for laughs? Some of the humor was ok, but not good enough to make up for the rest of this movies problems.
The acting and dialogue is written'played to be corny and lame with clich'e driven innuendo that gets old fast. The actors do do a good job with what they have to work with and as they were directed.

As for the movie it's a cheesy horror flick that meant to be a cheesy horror flick. It has the action of a gory R rater film but the comedy and script of a PG13 movie. Some of the drawbacks to the movie are that it spends maybe the first 40-50 minutes creating the story and developing the characters and then the last 20-25 minutes is the killing spree. This is NOT a movie to be taken seriously So don't expect it to be serious.

The story of this film takes place in the swamps of Louisiana. Where a crazy deformed killer lurks looking to enact revenge on anyone he crosses. As a kid he was accidentally killed by his father who tried to save him from a group of boys that wanted to scare him. Now he has come back from the dead as a full grown man with a taste for vengeance Friday the 13th style. While carrying about his daily life of looking for people to kill he comes across a Swampland tour boat that gets stuck and that's where the movie starts (at least his part). The movie from there takes on a weird sort of Comedy/brutal horror movie type of theme. It's hard to describe because he comedic scenes are so corny the kill scenes are so over the top. It's not like Troma, or like Scream it's like Nickelodeon meets HBO late night cinema. If that sounded weird to you than you can guess how this movie was to watch. It will appeal to a certain kind of movie watcher. Who that is I don't really know. It's an amusing slash horror flick.

Well, after some time I found myself wanting to check out the film again and the second time around I loved it. Going into this knowing what to expect gave me a new found appreciation for Hatchet, so much so that I consider it one of my favorite modern day slashers.
The characters here are great and offer plenty of laughs but their comedic tone dies down when Victor Crowley appears which gives you this rollercoster type of effect. It gets better every time I watch it.",1355011200,,792,4.387755102040816

So if you're renting this expecting some mind-bending, intellectual horror film with a complex plot and great character development. Then rent ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Otherwise, if your looking for a fun horror that you and your friends can laugh and drink some beers to, go for it!

It has all the classic horror movie attributes; boobs, blood and the bad guy!

So honestly, not sure who would rent this expecting a Shakespearian epic, but for someone who feels like putting on a movie that can provide some laughs, a few jumps and possibly some good quotes.

3299317,5,B0011FLM00,"HATCHET

There has been many a debate about this film right here, some from both sides get very passionate about their feelings on this film. There are those who thought it was way over rated and then there are the ""Hatchet Army"" members who are all about it. I personally would fall between the two at various times when watching this since its release. At first I was not about this flick really because I went in expecting a serious horror flick. When I did that thanks to some friends I was rather let down. But once I actually went back and watched the behind the scenes and watched with the commentary I gained a new found respect for this flick.

See I was misinformed about this film and its intentions, this film is meant to be straight fun and nothing more. It is meant as a throw back to classic 80's slasher flicks and was supposed to be humorous and crazy. Go in with the brain off and I guarantee that this will be entertaining, and that is all, just a fun time. The commentary for this flick is excellent as well, one of the best I have listened to in a long time. And the behind the scenes stuff is great, what they did to get this flick made was great. I really respect these guys for getting this done; maybe I am a member of the ""Hatchet Army"".

The film follows a group of people in New Orleans and a girl named Marybeth who is looking for her brother and father. Her brother and father went missing in the swamp one night when they were hunting alligators. This group goes on a haunted boat ride in the swamp looking to see something spooky. The thing is most of them don't know about the ghost/killer that lurks in the woods known as ""Victor Crowley, or Hatchet Face"". And from those who have heard of him it seems only one knows the truth. So as they go deeper into the swamp their nightmares become more and more real.

That has all the makings of a great slasher flick right? Well for me the first time it was no but now I would say a very much yes. The things I found annoying the first time I now find hilarious. Some performances I thought were annoying the first time I now love, funny how ones mind state can affect your viewing experience. Any way I thought this film was really funny, especially Deon Richmond and Perry Shen. There is one moment from Shen that I and my brother rewound over and over again. That scene had us rolling on the floor, it was great.

Of course it is cool to see Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, and Tony Todd all on the same film again. Two are quick cameos but Hodder is the star killer here as poor Victor. The kills as one would expect are cool and the effects are good. It also does not hurt having those topless girls for most of the flick. I think the setting of the film may be my favorite thing about the film. It is at least one of the top reasons why I like the film. I would not like to be lost out in those swamps let alone with a killer ghost thing after me that is huge. Seriously Victor is a big boy and undead killer or not he looks like he could rip your head off.

Writer/producer/director Adam Green who also made the film ""Frozen"" that I reviewed really brought his a game here. Why wouldn't he either since this is a character he has had in his head since he was a kid. After going back and not watching the flick in a way it was not meant to be viewed I have to say he did a good job. The movie was really good and the behind the scenes stuff is really good as well. Add in the excellent commentary and you have a 5 star DVD/Blu-Ray.",1319241600,,3511,4.155882352941177
3299318,3,B0011FLM00,"If you enjoy seeing dumb mostly unlikeable characters being hacked up and ripped to shreds, the odds are you will appreciate Hatchet (2006).  Horror legend Kane Hodder (Friday the 13th series), plays Victor Crowley, a huge grotesque hulk, who lives in the swamps of Louisiana, and eviscerates anyone who has the misfortune of crossing his path.  The savage kills are the best thing about the film.  A number of them feature dismemberment, and are quite over the top.

It's Mardi Gras time, but looking to do something different, Ben (Joel David Moore) and his buddy Marcus (Deon Richmond) decide to join a group taking a haunted swap tour.  After a bus ride into the swamp, they board a small boat, and head out on the river for a night of thrills.  The tour abruptly ends when Shawn (Perry Shen), the inexperienced guide, gets the boat stuck on some rocks.  After an encounter with an alligator, the agitated bunch reaches the shore.

Marybeth (Tamara Feldman), one of the passengers, who pulled out a gun to scare off the alligator, reveals that she is looking for her missing father and brother.  Marybeth also informs the group about Victor Crowley, a huge freakish man who was accidentally killed some time back, when his father drove an axe into his skull.  Legend has it that Crowley still prowls the swamps, slaying whoever he meets.  Why all this matters is because Crowley's house is just up the hill from where the group has landed.  On cue, Crowley suddenly appears, and armed with an axe, murders two people, literally ripping their bodies apart.

Thus begins a slaughter in the swamp, as the brainless and extremely talkative group, tries to stay alive in what plays out like a really bad episode of Scooby Doo, except with some extremely gory kills.  Ben (who kind of looks like Shaggy) leads the group, who scamper around in the woods, only to end up travelling in a circle.  They then decide to try and trap the monster.  Like the Scooby Doo gang, things don't quite go as planned, but somehow they do manage to achieve their goal of setting Crowley on fire.  They flee into a cemetery, but not surprisingly, Crowley is already there, and makes another limb snapping kill.  The movie's extremely abrupt cliffhanger ending is disturbing, however the story would be continued almost exactly where it ended, in the sequel Hatchet II (2010), although with a different actress in the lead role. (So much for continuity!)

As Victory Crowley, Kane Hodder is scary as hell, although some of his jerky movements do look very ridiculous.  It seems that even if the victims acted intelligently, nothing could save them, as Crowley is practically invincible.  Even after being critically injured several times, he pops up later at places where he has no logical business being.  Despite the shocking gore and some occasional nudity, the film's attempts at humor, and limp dialog, make it a hard pill to swallow at times.  The characters are mostly annoying, obnoxious, dumb, and often cowardly.  Neither competent nor likeable, when this bunch is savagely ripped to shreds, it's hard to feel sorry for them.  Written and directed by Adam Green (Frozen), Hatchet is far from subtle, but it has its moments, particularly if you are in the mood for a chickens in the pen type massacre.  The unrated director's cut contains additional scenes, and also includes a commentary that is not included on the R rated version.",1310860800,2,3420,4.843373493975903

3299323,1,B0011FLM00,"A slasher film set in the creepiness of a Lousiness Bayou starring the unparalleled Kane Hodder as the killer?

How on earth did they screw that up?

The Marilyn Manson song starting the film off was an early warning sign, that kind of faux-edgy brainless garbage is incredibly indicative of the film's content.

The poltergeist explanation of Victor Crowley is used to annihilate any sense of atmosphere the film could have. There is no slow stalking with suspenseful music. Nearly every single kill is done in the same way. Characters are talking, Crowley literally teleports into there midst, roars stupidly, kills one of them and disappears for another few minutes. Kane Hodder is capable of the most menacing walk and body language of any actor in Hollywood and this film utterly FAILS to make use of it at all.

Yes slasher villains are basically indestructible, but Crowley's status as a ghost with a physical form makes him literally invincible. There is no conceivable way they can win. Not that they would anyway, but come on.

What was the point of this? It sure wasn't old-school American Horror. It was the one of the worst excesses of modern horror pretending to be a slasher film, like a child wearing his father's suit",1303171200,4,1234,4.829383886255924

3299325,3,B0011FLM00,"HATCHET is the best Slasher film to come out in the last thirty years -- at least according to creator Adam Green. There is no mistaking his love and enthusiasm for the genre, but HATCHET fails to live up to its own hype. Deep within the swamps of the Louisiana bayou, a tour boat filled with passengers crashes near the home of the legendary Victor Crowley, a deformed boy that was killed years ago but who continues to haunt the swamplands. Unfortunately for this group of teens, Victor Crowley lives, and he has an ax to grind with anyone who crosses into his domain!

Green clearly understands the classic conventions of the Slasher film, and better yet, he understands what most Slasher fans want: a ton of gore and even more gratuitous nudity. The problem is that HATCHET only delivers on these two superficial levels, and fails to bring a unique story, interesting characters, or even a steady pace. It starts strong enough with two incredibly violent deaths, but the plot plods on with only mild hints at humor and no kills. Finally, when the teens approach Crowley's house in the woods, things pick up dramatically (at least in the gore department). One character is hacked in half before his wife has her head ripped apart from her jaw in a gush of blood! From there, limbs fly, faces are sanded off, and heads are crushed before Crowley can finally be stopped... Or so it seems...

If the gruesome displays had only been spread out more evenly throughout the film, HATCHET may have at least been a more entertaining watch, but it takes far too long to get into the action with too little payoff. Minor things like the horribly artificial lighting also distract from the events on screen, although Joel Moore and Deon Richmond do their best to keep the audience involved. Kane Hodder also returns with another menacing villain as Victor Crowley, but what Green fails to realize is that there is just no marketability in a big misshapen monster. Without a hockey mask or a red and green sweater to sell come Halloween, Crowley just becomes another faceless killer trailing behind Cropsey and Madman Marz.

Considering this was only his first film, most Horror fans will be willing to forgive many of the film's weaknesses based on Green's inexperience, but HATCHET is a guilty pleasure at best.

The premise is simple and all the low-grade horror rules are followed (e.g. cheesy comedy, full frontal nudity, stupid victim decisions).  A bunch of random characters go where they shouldn't - this time on a swamp cruise near New Orleans - slightly outside of cellphone coverage, and they just wander upon the local horror story of Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder - Jason, Friday the 13th), a disfigured mutant madman who was born into reclusion and has a nasty hatchet wound to the face.  Victor seems to miss his daddy quite a bit, and everyone who wonders upon his decrepit cabin in the remote swamp lands of Louisiana scares him enough that he has to break out his hatchet, shovel, or pitchfork to kill the interloper.

Gore galore, enough blood to start a wave pool, and extra prosthetic limbs for when bimbo tourists get theirs ripped off.  To warn at least one of the people on the cruise, ""Heads up!""  You won't find much new age CGI garbage here.  If anything, the kill scenes are the truest homage to traditional horror.  The production values and music are satisfactory, but

Don't go into this expecting Citizen Kane, and you won't be too upset.  It's kind of like taking a drink of soda when you expect water.  There are no additives here; it's simply water.  Enjoy the water...with just a little red food coloring.

3299335,5,B0011FLM00,"It was actually kind of nice to watch a first time director that actually loved the horror genre. Sure, there were tits ahoy! and buckets and buckets of blood. But to not have cgi was very refreshing. You can tell that the director really cared about the making of this movie. There was a certain type of glee in the different types of killing employed. He even managed to get some big time horror names, Kane Hodder ( whom if anyone knows me at all---im a HUGE fan) and Robert Englund.
The plot line is generic, a swamp tour in louisiana run by a asian guy that has no clue about the lore of the locals, or piloting a boat, for that matter. Once that boat runs aground, the usual mayhem accurs. Kane Hodder plays the villian, Victor Crowley, really terrifying and scary. It really is a ""must-see"" for any horror fan. If you watch the extras ( which I highly recommend) you find out a little tidbit about Kane Hodder, that when he plays a monster, he doesnt let the rest of the cast see him wandering about in make-up, the first time we see him in full-makeup is the first time the ""stars"" see him, also. It really is funny because half of them look like they peed their pants.",1269475200,2,1177,4.306306306306307
3299336,4,B0011FLM00,"Victor Crowley was born deformed and forced into seclusion with his father in a cabin in a New Orleans swamp. Ridiculed and tortured by the local children, he is thought to have burned alive until he returns years later and wreaks havoc on a boat tour full of tourists, entrepreneurs, air-heads and frat-boys. Crowley obviously has anger issues and a hatchet to grind, so to speak.

For writer/director Adam Green, ""Hatchet"" is a labor of love. The man grew up on 80's slashers such as ""Friday the 13th"" and it shows. Aside from casting the most notorious Jason Voorhees of them all - Kane Hodder - in the title role, the film is also host to other horror icons such as Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series) and Tony Todd (""Candyman"" himself). If the trio of horror royalty doesn't seal the deal, then surely the make-up effects by John Carl Buechler (whose credits are too long to list) certainly do. Buechler's work here runs the gamut from sickening to hilariously over-the-top (all about that belt sander!) and call back to a time when horror movies were pure escapism. No doubt, this is a horror film that doesn't take itself too seriously (in sharp contrast to films like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"") but at the same time, is a quality slasher flick that doesn't skimp on the thrills.

From front to finish, all 84 minutes of ""Hatchet"" are pure slasher goodness. Rather than being just a stale homage to the franchise films that dominated his childhood, Green has actually created an icon all his own that pays loving tribute rather than references. While Victor Crowley may never reach the heights of Freddy, Jason or Michael, he's certainly the stuff fan-favorites are made of, appropriate for the cult classic that this film is destined to become. You just can't go wrong with a horror movie made by a fan with a talented cast and outrageous effects. It's the perfect movie to chill with on a Friday night and certainly one of the finest modern slashers to come along in a long time.

3299340,4,B0011FLM00,"If you grew up in the 80s and you've become disenchanted with the direction of current horror movies, then Hatchet is certainly for you. Hatchet harkens back to an era when horror movies were supposed to be fast paced, fun and most of all, entertaining. Like I said, if you grew up worshiping horror from the 80s, you will undoubtedly enjoy Hatchet. If you like your horror movies with a little more sophistication or a plot that is ripe with twists and turns...then you might want to avert your eyes.

Here is the backdrop for Hatchet. A group of friends head down to Mardi Gras to cheer up their pal, Ben (Joel Moore), who recently got dumped. Unfortunately, Ben is far too melancholy to enjoy the drunken debauchery and ample cleavage that New Orleans has to offer. So to take his mind off things he decides to track down a haunted swamp tour. His friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) begrudgingly tags along. Eventually, Ben, Marcus and a few others end up on a boat ride down the swampy Bayou led by a dim-witted Asian tour guide (Perry Shen). Alas, the swamps are haunted by a deformed madman named Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder), and he doesn't like trespassers.

What unfolds in the swamp is an amazing spectacle of grotesque gore and over the top violence. There are some incredibly unique death scenes in Hatchet and they won't disappoint your inner gorehound. One by one the members of the tour get picked off, but unlike most slasher films you almost feel bad for them. The actors do a great job of making these idiotic characters likable. You will be rooting for them to escape despite the odds stacked heavily in Crowley's favor. It all happens at a breakneck pace and you never have time to exhale as the movie kicks into high gear for the finale. Some won't like the ending, but I was more than satisfied with it.

Hatchet is a true homage to 80s filmmaking. It features genuinely funny banter between characters, tons of gratuitous nudity and over the top bloodshed. You will laugh, you will jump out of your seat and you will certainly wince away during Hatchet's finer moments. Be on the lookout for cameos from Robert Englund and particularly Tony Todd, who has a hilarious little role. While this film might have been considered ""by the numbers"" back in 1988 it feels fresh and new in 2008. Watch Hatchet with a big group of people, crack open some beers and enjoy the carnage.

Final Grade: B+",1249257600,,2406,4.614485981308412
3299341,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is a movie claiming to be an Old School American horror which may boast a bit too much. Not really sure what defines an American horror in the first place, you can only assume it's a throw back to the days where the slasher flick ruled. Judging by the blood soaked hatchet on the cover it was a safe assumption. If you're going into this film unsure if you will like it then you only have to ask yourself one question. Do you like non-stop gruesome gore? If you said yes then you are going to love this one.

We start with a group of very unlikeable characters as they cruise through a Louisiana swamp as part of a haunted boat tour run by some annoying Asian kid. Once the boat has an accident and begins to sink the crew must abandon ship to walk through the lush creepy forest in hopes of finding their way back to town. Only problem is the very woods they wander is said to be plagued by deformed maniac Victor Crowley. As they walk through the swamp freaks turf they see it's not just folklore once they start getting picked off one by one in extreme gore fashion.

Hatchet was hard to form an opinion on since we weren't really sure what to expect. Typically we hope for more of a chilling/edge of your seat thriller as opposed to a complete gore-fest. However the film was pretty entertaining. Especially for the fact that you can't stomach most of the cast and hope for them to get chopped up. Once you realize it's more of a horror-comedy that pays tribute to the Friday the 13th era you should have a good time with it. In no way is Hatched anything special but it will be loved by the gore enthusiast. When pondering if a young Sid would have enjoyed this the result is inconclusive.",1245369600,,1702,4.315625
3299342,5,B0011FLM00,"I love this movie! Seriously, this is an almost perfect mix of gore and humor, I really do hope that Hatchet 2 (and 3, and 4, this is a slasher after all) is made. One minor quip is with the ending. It's a big ""What the *bleep*"" moment, but does little to hurt the overall excellence of this movie.",1243123200,2,298,4.067796610169491
3299343,2,B0011FLM00,"I want to start by saying that I grew up in the 80's, I know that makes me OLD, anyway, I have seen just about every hack n' slash movie from that era and some I love and some are awful.  I'll try to make this simple by outlining the pro's and con's but first the plot summary.

PLOT: A group of people go into the Louisiana swamps (that are closed) and encounter a killer.

A couple of *SPOILERS* below:
Pro's
1. The gore is definitely good in this flick, not a lot of CGI but more of the old school style with prosthetic appliances etc... That's an A in my book, because the effects look more realistic.

2. Great opening action and set up.  The pace is fast and really gets you into the movie.

3. The atmosphere is creepy and the sound effects are good.

4. The DVD quality was terrific, clear picture and sound.

Con's
1. The characters are awful because of really bad writing.  I know your supposed to have bad actors in horror but really the dialogue needs to be believable at least.  The ""comedic"" moments are so poorly done.

2. The pacing stinks, after that great opening sequence the brakes are put on and the whole thing starts to crawl.  Ok, I know that's normal in a slasher flick but this one takes too long to get going again and with that inane dialogue it's really hard to care about anything happening.

3. The killer looks like Jason because it's essentially the same mask!  Come on, I know Kane Hodder played the part in John Beuchler's (special effects creator on this film) Friday the 13th Part 7 but come up with something more than Jason's mask.  I mean really, that's just lame.

4. Predictable to the extreme, although the black character isn't the first to die in this one, but that's about it as far as any surprises.

I would not say that this movie was awful but it didn't hold my interest, however, the gore scenes were good.  If you just want gore this one will do the trick but otherwise it's not the most enjoyable ""throwback"" movie that is out there.  My personal favorites would be Splinter or Dark Ride.  While Dark Ride isn't terrific, it was one of the first to restart this genre of bringing splatter back to the theaters.",1241049600,3,2163,4.36
3299344,2,B0011FLM00,"I see folks saying that ""Hatchet"" is an ""homage"" and or ""spoof"" of 1980's slasher flicks, and don't quite understand why? To me the ""homage/spoof"" to 80's slashers was already perfected with ""Scream"". ""Hatchet"" does play out like a horror/comedy, but captures none of the feel of it's 1980's predecessors.

What I liked about the movie - It was great seeing some of horror's leading men sharing screen time, Kane Hodder (Jason), Robert Englund (Freddy) and Tony Todd (Candyman) all make appearances in the film. (Hodder pulls double duty playing both parts of the Crowley clan, so we get an extended non-makeup cameo). Of course this has been done before in flicks like ""Wishmaster"" and ""Behind the Mask"". I liked too that the special effects were old school latex and rubber as opposed to CGI. The best part of the film for me though was the character Marcus played by Deon Richmond whose one-liners lightened up an otherwise dreary and lifeless script. Richmond was the ONLY element of comedy that worked in the entire film, the rest was fairly lifeless and flat.

What I didn't like about the film - I guess the idea of ""spoofing"" the slasher genre was to take everything over-the-top. The characters were all over-the-top stereotypes, with the trashy girls flashing boobs so often it actually became boring. The nerdy guy was too nerdy, the hillbilly swamp people were over-the-top rednecks, and even the blood was way over the top. I like gore as much as the next guy, but I like it to flow with some realism. The splatter found in ""Hatchet"" was just a notch below what was seen in ""Kill Bill"", fountains would spray everywhere when someone was chopped, and it just looked ridiculous. What really grated on my nerves, and where any 1980's comparison is lost, is when it came to the killer Victor Crowley. Is he a ghost? Is he a monster? Does anyone really know? Does anyone care? While Victor's backstory is perfect for a slasher villain, the actual ""creature"" is kind of lame. Looking like a cross between ""Pumpkinhead"" and Jason Voorhees from ""Jason Takes Manhattan"", Crowley isn't very scary. Plus he runs and screams...which is never good for a slasher villain. The film would have been much better had Victor simply ""stalked"" his victims, instead we see him running around like crazy, waving his arms and screaming??!

If you want a genuine spoof of 80's slashers, pick up either ""Scream"" or ""Behind the Mask"" both are fantastic, and spoof the genre without falling to the level of stupidity found in ""Hatchet"".",1239926400,,2521,4.817551963048499

The first half is more comedy (but comedy that is actually funny!) than horror as we are introduced to the characters who are most very likeable and funny, the blonde bimbo being particularly funny, as she is purposely exaggerated as a parody of the usual blonde, buxom heroine in slasher movies.

The comedy ends and the horror begins about halfway through as the characters, having all met on a boat to go on a horror trip as a break from the parties of Mardi Gras, get stranded in the woods with a hatchet weilding, deformed maniac. There is a good reason behind why the killer kills and the death scenes are all very gory, plus I liked the twist in the end.

But if you want to watch a funny and entertaining film, which doesn't require a lot of thought, then I say go for it.  After watching Australia this afternoon, I found Hatchet refreshing.

3299348,4,B0011FLM00,"If not taken seriously, ""Hatchet"" is a fun parody of slasher flicks from the eighties.  During Mardi Gras, a motley crew of New Orleans tourists take a haunted boat ride through an alligator infested swamp.  The boat is being illegally piloted through a part of the swamp that is off limits due to disappearances.  A deformed maniac who looks like the Elephant man on steroids uses his hatchet to kill the tourists who stumble upon his cabin after their boat is stranded.

  What if the USS Minnow of ""Gilligan's Island"" had shipwrecked on an island inhabited by Jason Voorhees?  What you would have is ""Hatchet.""  The characters are silly and hilarious.  I laughed more than I screamed.  The two bimbos who are tricked by a slimy director into filming ""Bayou Beaver"" are incredibly stupid.  The blonde one who has never heard of NYU keeps insisting that the police and the cops are different entities.

  The acting is good; the dialogue is hilarious.  The cast consists of cameos from actors who portrayed famous serial killers such as Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) and Tony Todd (Candyman).  The huge Kane Hodder (who dressed up as Jason in later entries of the ""Friday the 13th"" films) is Victor Crowley.  Joel David Moore (""Sprial"") stars as Ben who convinces his best friend Marcus (Deon Richmond) to take the haunted boat tour; Ben befriends Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) who is searching for her missing father and brother, victims of Victor Crowley.

  High body count fiends, like myself, and gorehounds will enjoy ""Hatchet.""  Many of the death scenes are incredibly violent and gory.  Victor Crowley loves to rip limbs and organs out of tourists who trespass on his property.  He behaves more like a raging animal than a human.  There is a great deal of suspense as potential victims try to hide and/or outrun Victor.  The legend of how he became a monster is very interesting and reminded me much of ""The Burning.""  Pranksters set fire to his house on Halloween night when he was a child.  He was supposedly killed when his father tried to break the door down with an axe.  However, like Jason, he managed to survive in order to seek revenge.

  ""Hatchet"" is highly recommended for fans of slasher flicks from the eighties that involved killers in the woods such as ""Final Terror,"" ""Friday the 13th, ""The Burning,"" and ""Madman.""  It has a wonderfully downbeat, open ending that was often found in horror films of the seventies and eighties.  I recommend watching it late at night with some friends during a beer and pizza party.",1235692800,,2538,4.814385150812065
3299349,4,B0011FLM00,"I'd heard about Hatchet on the internet sometime back but paid it no mind as I thought it was another cheap attempt at old school horror when most movies I'd seen to make that kind of claim was just a waste of my time. I can't tell you how many movies I've seen make the claim that it was the best film of 'this or that' genre of all-time only to be a real waste of celluloid(so you can understand why I was skeptical) Yet, when I seen the trailer for the movie on the ""His Name Was Jason"" DVD, I decided that- if I came across the film- I'd get it and view it. Wouldn't you know it, folks, I find it the very next day. So, I buy it and viewed it & can honestly say that it lives up to its' hype f giving us some old school american horror. It's hard to believe that this story came from the mind of an 8 year old boy.

The story goes a little something like this...A group of tourists go on a Haunted Swamp Tour only to find the legend of Victor Crowley to be true when people start dying left and right. Who is Victor Crowley, you might ask? A deformed Louisiana swamp dweller who lays waste to all those who come on his turf. Directed by Adam Green, the movie stars Joel Moore, Tamara Feldman, Deon Richmond, Mercedes McNab, Parry Shen, Joleigh Fioreavanti, Joel Murray, with cameos by Joshua Leonard(Blair Witch Project), Tony Todd(Candyman), Kane Hodder(Friday the 13th 7-8-9-10) & Robert Englund(A Nightmare on Elm Street series). Special Features include: Audio Commentary, The Making of Hatchet, Meeting Victor Crowley, Guts and Gore, Anatomy of a Kill, A Twisted Tale, Gag reel & trailer. Trailers for ""Spiral"", ""Beyond the Mask:the Rise of Leslie Vernon"", ""Karas: Revelation"", and Anchor Bay's horror line are also included.

I'm inclined to agree, it is a great movie with the right amount of terror and mayhem & humor as well. Yes, I said humor. It doesn't weigh down the movie, mind you. It only makes it better. Overall, it was a fun slasher movie to watch that earns its' place amongst all the greats out there.

I would go so far as to demand that these Filmmakers ask those Legends of Slasher films for an apology for using their (films) memory as a marketing ploy - because if you didn't grow up on 80s Horror and you think Hatchet is it, you're sadly mistaken.

For those of you looking for a cool Evil Dead 2-esque take on the slasher genre, you will be extremely disappointed with this hack job of a film.  Hatchet goes something like this:  After a painfully long and dull setup, teens get trapped in the bayou and stalked by an invincible burn victim.  One gets killed, and they run to another part of the bayou and bicker.  Then the maniac shows up again, kills one of them, and they run another 100 yards (somehow shaking the guy off their trail).  Repeat.  It all gets so repetitive that I soon wished the killer would be a little more efficient in doing his work.  In my opinion, Hatchet replaces Slumber Party Massacre 3 as being the worst slasher movie ever made.  I am quite sure that watching it actually destroyed brain cells.

For an awesome slasher movie that's got campy laughs, I encourage you to revisit some of the 80's yarns like SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT (""Punish!"") or FRIDAY THE 13th PART 6 ""Jason Lives"" (Jason get reanimated by a bolt of lightning).",1227830400,5,1180,4.549763033175355

3299361,3,B0011FLM00,"""Hatchet"" is definitely one of the most talked-about horror movies of the past year or so, but not necessarily talked-about in a good way; this movie has recently become notorious for getting many mixed reactions. I myself even feel mixed about this movie. So the big question with ""Hatchet"" is this: WHY does this movie get so many mixed reactions?
The biggest reason in my opinion is this: ""Hatchet"", as funny and gory as it is, suffers from being UNEVEN.
I personally liked the movies because the first half was basically a comedy, and rather entertaining at that. The movie also has excellent gore, though the first three kills are a little hard for my eyes to watch. Anyway, I also think the characters of this movie are very true to life. I can really see myself and a friend of mine acting like Ben and Marcus, at least a little bit.
So the humor, gore and characters are all strong points of ""Hatchet"", so why do people dislike it? I, like many other people, feel like this:
Well, let me ask you this: Why did all the Friday the 13th and Halloween movies keep you entertained? They were consistent with the action, murders and plot! There would be a slower scene of people talking, then somebody goes off and gets killed. The pace picks up a bit, and the tension rises.
With ""Hatchet"", everything occurs slowly, and basically saves most of the horror for the end. Don't get me wrong, that can definintely work in movies, just look at the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". They basically saved the scariest stuff for the last half-hour.
But with ""Hatchet"", it's easy to get bored, frustrated or agitated at the movie because it's very inconsistent, and the characters are often getting angry or acting dumb...all right, never mind that last part, lots of characters make bad choices in slasher films, heh-heh.
So what's the final verdict on ""Hatchet""?:
If you want a funny slasher-horror with lots of gore, RENT IT.
If you want a short, easily digestable movie and have nothing better to do with your time, RENT IT.
If you want a genius OR serious OR consistent horror movie, SKIP IT.
If you want an original movie that breaks new ground, or it at least rather imaginative, SKIP IT.

So ""Hatchet"" was good for a one-time view and I might search it again online and rewatch it sometime in the future. I can tell that they had lots of great ideas for this movie but unfortunately, all the good stuff as in funny scenes, gore shots and character development, was mixed with boring stuff, frustrating stuff, or just generally uninteresting scenes.

Some horny 20 somethings on vacation in New Orleans to get plastered and laid. One of the guys just can't get over his ex so he decides to take a haunted swamp tour. The tour doesn't happen quite as planned and hijinx ensue.

My major gripe with the film is the antagonist and its back story. I thought it was just something stupid and thrown together. There were definitely funny moments, but any redeeming factors were usurped by the ending.

3299364,2,B0011FLM00,"No other film has received such mixed reviews more than ""HATCHET"" among my amazon friends. Most of them, hated this film, while lately, it has began to achieve a minor cult following. ""Hatchet"" is the type of film that definitely depends on what you are looking for in a movie experience. I think a film requires somewhat of an acquired taste, but one thing, I have to say it is a homage to the 80's ""slasher"" flicks and NOT to be taken seriously.

Mardi Gras, New Orleans: two friends, Marcus (Deon Richmond) and Ben (Joel David Moore) are gallivanting around the town, drinking and scoping out the sights (I mean half naked women). Ben becomes insistent on taking a haunted swamp tour. They come across a pretty but moody young local woman named Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) who is actually looking for her father and her brother who had disappeared in this same swamp some nights ago. When the boat hit's a boulder and sinks, the group is forced to walk back to the city. Little do they know that a monstrous killer called Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder) is hot on their trail and they must fight their way to survive.

Adam Green's low-budget is an attempt to return to the days of Jason, Madman, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger because it is well-known that iconic killers can make such a low-budget film shine. There are two ways to approach this film. Take it as a humorous venture into the world of slasher flicks, much like you should see ""Eight Legged Freaks"" and ignore whatever faults it has. Another way, is to envision the film as something where there is no ambition in its casting, it follows the same formulaic elements and criticize its measly budget. But the question has to be, did the film present a new successful figure in the books of ""slashing"" villains?

Well, Victor Crowley is a blend of Jason Voorheese and Freddy Krueger, mixed in with Leatherface and Madman. The film would owe a lot of royalties to other iconic slasher films. Crowley just won't die, no matter how many times you stab him, shoot him or burn him. Crowley just keeps on going and revels on the murder that he has been doing. I would like to see him take on Jason. ""Victor vs. Jason"" anyone? (oh no, did I just pitch an idea?)

The film doesn't bring anything new to the horror genre and has a very ""exaggerated"" execution and it does it intentionally. Director/writer Adam Green knew that he had to make fun of his own creation. The characters are a vacationing couple, two friends looking for a good time, a couple of air headed bimbos, a pervert and a young woman on a mission led by an Asian man. The characters themselves seemed very unlikable, and Green meant it to be this way. The script is too hollow and the dialogue can get laughable if you don't see that it was meant to be this way. ""Janey's got a gun"", a statue masturbating, and the quippy attempts at humor by Deon Richmond and Perry Chen can either be annoying or amusing. The proceedings do seem pointless a lot of times.

Now, the film does have some inventive ""kill"" sequences. The blood and gore are done ""old-school"" way; no CGI or special effects--the film utilizes the use of prosthetics and a lot of gooey red ink. Japanese splatter horror elements are sometimes used on some scenes to again make fun of itself. Turning one's head 180 degrees or ripping the arms out of their sockets may not be original but it is fun to watch. Yes, if you are looking for an abundance of blood and gore, then this film will satisfy--just don't think it will be horrifying, it will for the most part, feel a little comedic.

""Hatchet"" is a actually more a cheesy attempt on comedy than a horror film. I do accept the fact that the film is making fun of itself, but the characters are just plain bad that they're bad. I do try to see it as a homage and all, but I just can't say for sure just what the filmmakers wanted to do. It's not really funny, but funny in a way that it is silly. It isn't scary, the gore effects while well-done doesn`t feel unnerving. To its credit, I did laugh out loud at some scenes and the film does have a good amount of nudity. Kane Hodder is both amusing and imposing as the killer. I do think Adam Green probably loved his slasher flicks so much that he wanted to relive them. I'm not exactly sure what Green expected from his viewers.

Does it feel like I'm confused? I am. Maybe that is what Adam Green wanted, a audience full of mixed reactions, as a result of his mixed direction. I'll take ""JASON X"" over this.

3299365,4,B0011FLM00,"Happy Halloween everyone!!  If you haven't heard by now, ""Hatchet"" is Adam Green's homage to the 1980s Slasher genre; but not just your everyday, psychopath on the loose Slasher.  This pays homage to the Slasher Immortals:  Jason, Michael, Candy Man, Freddy... ...you know; the guys who never die.  As a rule, I hate these characters.  They become predictable and tiresome because no matter what you do to them, they'll come back for more.  I make one exception for these guys; their first films.  Since ""Hatchet"" is a ""first"" film, I'll cut it some slack.  Despite my less than enthusiastic tone, I really enjoyed this film.  Let's take a deeper look at it...

-THE TONE OF THIS FILM; IT'S USUALLY RED.
If you take Adam Green at his word (why not?), this is suppose to be a serious horror film with funny characters; not a horror comedy.  However he chose to rationalize it, it's a horror movie that you can laugh at.  I happen to love horror comedies, so he can shove his disclaimer up his ""yoo-hoo"".  Whatever his intensions, there was little about this film you could take too seriously other than the fact people were dying.  Don't get me wrong, the terror is real but never are your emotions challenged.  I snickered and chortled throughout most of it.  That's a good thing in my book.

-LIKE MY RETIREMENT INVESTMENTS, MY EMOTIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE BLEEDING!!
It's a good thing I didn't invest a lot of emotion into these characters.  Not that they aren't well developed or acted, because they are.  It's because even at their most likable, they are annoying people.  The lead character is played by Joel David Moore (why does everyone have 3 names these days?).  This guy is a wimpy version of David Schwimmer (is that possible?); so whiny and annoying.  He is accompanied by one of his wise cracking buds, played by Deon Richmond; the smartest person in the film but the one nobody listens too.  The heroine is played by Tamara Feldman.  In case you're wondering, she's the only young lady who does not display her assets in this film.  She might be the only one I cared about in the end.  The rest of the cast are clichs including a pervert doctor pretending to be a movie producer and his pair of duped and desperate actresses, a retired couple who could be Sarah Palin's parents, and the con-man tour guide whom we can blame for everything.  So, as the inevitable body count mounts, I had more sense of anticipation than dread.

-GORDITY; TWO GREAT TASTES THAT TASTE GREAT TOGETHER!
For those of you just skimming:  Gore + Nudity = Gordity.  ""Hatchet"" has ample and requisite amounts of both.  The nudity is what I'd call ""requisite"" because it's done in the guise of Mardi gras in New Orleans mixed with a faux ""Girls Gone Wild"" video shoot.  It is purposefully gratuitous and comedic but limited to flipping up of the tops.  I didn't complain.  The Gore was ""ample"", OFF THE CHARTS and too ludicrous to take seriously; way over the top!  This is a rare case where ""Unrated"" actually has valid meaning.  It's almost as if this films sole purpose was to revel in the creative kill.  When gas powered belt sanders (WTF?) are involved, then there are no limits in sight.  I'm not a gore hound, but this was done in such an over the top and entertaining way that I enjoyed it immensely.

-LET ME RESHOOT THE ENDING. (I won't tell you the ending but Spoilers ensue)
As this story starts out, we are introduced to characters in various states of cheer participating in Mardi gras.  Our lovelorn lead wants to forget about women by taking a haunted swamp tour.  The events prior to and during this portion are actually entertaining lead-ins to the carnage that follows.  Along the way we get to see Robert Englund, Tony Todd (in a very funny little role), and a puking chick.  The high jinx portion of the film ends with a goofy musical interlude during a ride on the short-bus; I'm not kidding.  As our cast gets lost in the swamp and the carnage ensues, I start to suspect a clever ending coming on.  I'm thinking; ""If this ends like I think it will, then this film is brilliant!""  Well, I outsmarted myself (or the Director).  I don't usually think my ideas are great, but this one was a natural.  You see, like Freddy and Jason and Michael, Victor (the mutated killer played by ""Jason"" Kane Hodder) is indestructible on a mortality level; you can't kill the dude.  This is the very reason I don't enjoy these films.  I thought it would have been really cool if some how, there were 15 of these dudes running around the haunted swamp.  That would have been a stunner!  But no; it's just one guy who can't be killed.  When I realized this, the cleverness of the film withered just a little.  I've seen enough bogy-men films.  I was hoping for a killer who wasn't superhuman.  For me, this was a case of taking homage a step too far.  The ending was a big THUD to me.

-THE END?
I'd have to recommend this to slasher fans and gore fans in general.  If you don't like horror comedies, then Adam Green made this for you, even though I got a lot of laughs and gruesome giggles out of it.  There is little mystery to this film since we are introduced to the killer very early and nothing is hidden.  I could forgive this film for rehashing the bogyman theme (which I'm tired of) because it was so witty and entertaining.  The annoying characters were well played and the production values were top notch.  I wish the story had taken a more creative turn without abandoning its homage theme, but the story as a whole was good enough.  The DVD is loaded with good ""making of"" material and commentary.  If they make a sequel with 15 Victors running around the swamps of Louisiana yelling ""DAAADDDYYY!!!"" then it was my idea.  Happy Halloween!!

3299366,2,B0011FLM00,"I heard a lot of positive things about this film. Some people even called it the ""best horror film of the year"" and commented that it was bringing 80's style horror back to the present day.

I didn't see that at all.

Hatchet is, at best, a gore flick.

If you are a fan of blood and guts, check this out. I honestly can appreciate a little bit of gore if it is done with a little bit of realism and doesn't delve far into the over-the-top, pointless realm. Hatchet dives right in. Let's face it, this movie had so much gore, I think we should just call it Al Gore.

The first scene involves a man being thrown into a tree, his arm torn off, his intestines pulled out and then his body ripped in half-all the while the poor guy screaming, ""IT HURTS!!!"" i just found it tacky and disgusting.

There are other scenes where a person's face face is pulled in half by the mouth and you see a wiggling tongue...a guy is literally hacked at for 30 seconds of cringe inducing disgust...another character has there face sanded off with a sand blaster and is left crawling around for a bit while the killer hacks at another victim. The kills are just really gross. I love horror, but I found the blood and guts just WAY too gross for my taste. And I can appreciate gore.

The gore is definetly worth it for those of you who enjoy that...but, for me, it killed the movie.

The plot was confusing. I didn't understand the whole ""mutated boy is burned alive in his shack but is still alive hacking people up in the swamp"" scenario. I mean, it's been done before with Jason...I get that...but this movie felt less condusive than the Friday series. The origin of the killer here is left more up in the air.

Also, I agree with a couple reviewers that the killer is shown FAR too much. He looks like a redneck Quasi-modo and despite his akward and icky appearance, his features and body makeup looked way too fake for me. He looked like a guy running around in a costume to me trying to be scary.

The acting was horrendous and definetly completely D-list. I did recognize the older lady from an episode of Roseanne and the blonde girl from the show Angel, but that was about it.

Anyways, it's not ""smart"" horror or anything new...but it should please the gore-hounds.

3299376,4,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet came with a lot of hype even before the movie started to shoot there was a lot of hype behind the film and expectations were quite high. There was a great marketing campaign and a lot of slasher fans had some high expectations. The hype of a film is a good thing and bad thing. The good it gets the word out on the film and helps gain it attention, but the bad is again the expectations people will now have will be very high.

Hatchet is very much in the style of an 80s slasher flick, but has enough going for it that it doesn't feel dated. I've seen a few movies inspired by 80s horror flicks and the filmmaker does such a great job at capturing that style that the movie even if just released feels dated so sometimes capturing that feel can also have it's downsides. Adam Green captures the basic concept of the early 80s slasher flick perfectly, but as much in common with the early 80s it also a lot of the mid to late 80s campy, but intentional feel.

Let's get one thing straight; don't go into Hatchet expecting a straight up slasher flick. If anything it's much more of a parody without beating you over the head with it, and I'm sure that is something a lot viewers weren't expecting. Most were probably expecting a more straight forward approach. The early marketing campaign did make it seem it would a more serious approach, which at times it is, but other times it isn't; in my opinion this is what makes Hatchet such a great ride.

I'm kind of surprised that so many people had such high expectations for Hatchet. I do enjoy slasher flicks from time to time where as when I was a kid I lived for them. But seriously most slasher flicks aren't very good. Yes they are a lot of fun to watch, but if you were to see a list of the greatest horror movies of all time only a handful of them would be slashers. The slasher film is just a fun movie that we like maybe a little more than we should.

Hatchet though is clearly one of the better slasher flicks and it's not just an excellent slasher movie, but an excellent movie in general. I guess I understand some of the complaints due to the expectations, but when you ask people what exactly they expected in most cases they can't answer they just say I thought it would be different. If you are a fan of 80s slasher flicks you should love Hatchet. Its gone hot women, nudity, great kill scenes and a lot of gore; isn't that what the slasher film is about?

The slasher flick started to die out a bit in the late 80s and by the 90s they were all, but gone until Scream revived it for a while, but in the years since Scream slasher flicks sort of went away again. Mainstream wise they're pretty much dead, but the DTV scene has a lot of slashers, but the problem is the filmmakers know there's an audience and there's no care, just trying to make a quick buck. Adam Green on the other hand clearly made this movie with the right intentions. Where all these filmmakers fail Adam Green succeeds.

The one thing that surprised me was at how well written Hatchet was; like I stated earlier most slasher flicks really weren't good per se, but enjoyable. The screenplay by Adam Green was actually really good, which was something I really didn't expect. The script was smart and creative and his characters were really great. Most of these movies have weak characters that basically are just there to pad out the body count, but Green makes the best of them all. Each character adds to the movie and honestly I didn't want any of them to die since they were so entertaining.

The slasher flick has been done a million times and really since the end of the 80s they haven't been the same. Every so often we get that one slasher flick that's enjoyable, but not nearly as enjoyable as those of the 80s, but Hatchet is the best slasher flick since the 80s and simply one of the best slashers period. There's something sort of funny about slasher flicks; the characters are often stupid and the kill scenes are so absurd it's hard to take serious and by the late 80s filmmakers started playing up to that. That's what Adam Green does and that really is why Hatchet works so well. The comedy aspect might turn some people off, but it had to be that way. As much fun as the early 80s slasher movies were they were also silly and the mid to late 80s filmmakers embraced that as does Adam Green. I don't think a straight forward approach would work as well. Hatchet is campy at times and the kills are over the top, but that was the whole point. Everything you see was intentional.

When it comes to horror filmmakers most people cite Rob Zombie, Eli Roth or Alexandre Aja as the best out there right now and while I do enjoy their work my money is on Adam Green as long as he continues to work in the horror genre. As director Adam Green does a great job here; He's able to create plenty of laughs, but also provide some really great suspenseful moments as well. By watching the DVD features it's quite clear Adam was living out his dream with this movie and that energy he had on set shines in the product. Like I stated these types of movies are a bit absurd at times and Adam Green plays up to these things and makes such an enjoyable movie.

I think there are many great horror flicks out there right now, but the problem is they seem to lack the fun factor they once had and Adam Green brings that back. From beginning to end Hatchet is just a fun movie. Again you'll laugh and even maybe feel the suspense and sometimes you'll get both at the same time. Adam plays up to the clichs and silly moments these movies have and delivers a great and enjoyable movie.

Victor Crowley played by Kane Hodder is a villain the past. You just don't see characters like this anymore in horror and I wasn't sure how well he would work in this era, but Adam Green and Hodder create a great new Iconic villain. Crowley is something out of the 80s and actually reminds me a bit of Madman Marz of the movie Madman, only Crowley is the better of the two and Hatchet is by far the better movie. Don't expect another Jason Voorhees, which many were expecting since Kane played the part, but Crowley is very 80s, but with a solid modern update.

The strongest aspect of Hatchet was the cast; all the actors were clearly having fun and it really shows. Again the characters are very well written and the scenes with Misty played by Mercedes McNab and Jenna played by Joleigh Fioreavanti are probably the most entertaining of the movie. These 2 girls work so well together. Misty is the typical dumb blonde and the actress very much plays up to that. Deon Richmond and Parry Shen though steal the show. These 2 guys were hysterical together and on their own. Joel David Moore is excellent as the hero Ben; he's a normal guy and really easy to relate to and Tamara Feldman as MaryBeth makes for an excellent heroine. Again all the characters are excellent and every one of them adds to the movie rather than being just there to die.

The kill scenes in Hatchet are great and the gore is plenty and the best part is it wasn't all CGI, which has been a problem in this genre the last few years. The F/X were done by John Carl Buechler who appears as Jack Cracker and is best known to horror fans as the director of Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood. There are also cameos by the Iconic Robert Englund and Tony Todd

I get why so many people found Hatchet a letdown and had I not known it was more of a parody I probably would have disappointed with it as well. And I also get due to the hype expectations are probably very high and seeing as Hatchet got over so well at film festivals like Tribeca again expectations were high. But I urge anyone reading this that expected a straight up slasher flick or expected more out of it to give Hatchet another chance. As much as I enjoyed Hatchet I think it actually gets better on multiple viewings. Hatchet is essential viewing for any slasher fan; Adam Green wanted to make something that was just simply fun and entertaining and he very much delivers on that.",1217030400,2,8044,4.333333333333333

Do you love comedy and horror? I do. Do you love them together? Me neither. They are two things that I don't think will ever work together. This movie is horrible and I hope you read this review carefully before even thinking about purchasing this movie. The back of the DVD case advertises its wonderful gore and nudity. Honestly, that is all this movie has that can be even considered good. That's right, the nudity is better than most of the movie itself. That's when you know a movie is bad.

The story is that a group of friends travel to New Orleans for Marti Gras. One of them has just broken up with his girlfriend and all the nudity is just making him depressed. He convinces one of his friends to come with him on a scary boat ride. Along on the ride are: Porn Stars, a fake director, an Asian tour guide, an older couple, and a mysterious girl. Eventually the horrible tour guide crashes into a rock. They escape the sinking boat only to find themselves in front of Victor Crowley's house. Victor Crowley was deformed as a child. Some kids were picking on him and went to the extreme and started a fire in his house. Victor's father came home to try to save him but instead he killed him by an accidental hatchet shot to the face. Naturally from there Victor controls the woods around the swamp and kills people. The group of people try to survive the monster, but are slowly picked off one by one.

If anything, the story sounds like any other cheap slasher movie. This is added in with some moronic teenage humor and you have the makings of a horrible film. I will say that I thought Victor and his origins were nicely done. Other then that the rest of the story is downright bad.

One thing that is a big plus for this movie is the gore factor. It's off the charts. The type of killing is unrealistic, but is very well done. You will see arms being ripped off, bodies ripped in half, and heads ripped apart by the jaws. Truly this is the best part of the movie. I would actually suggest just skipping to these parts if you own this movie.

This movie also advertises ""eye-popping nudity"" on the back of the case. There are a lot of women flashing people in the beginning, but not much after that. If for some reason you need more nudity in your films, you won't find it on this DVD.

Extras are your standard commentary track and making of stuff. The making of stuff is pretty cool because it shows you how they did a lot of the gore and stuff. They even show how they decided to do the gore with the use of action figures. You also get outtakes, but how many times are you going to watch that.

Skip this movie unless you are an absolute die hard for cheap slasher films. The acting in this movie is downright pitiful. Most of the actors are side characters from other, better films. If you want a good movie you should just keep of looking.",1215907200,2,2873,4.320964749536178

They get killed by something and then Marilyn Manson starts the movie with his song, This Is The New Sh*&. It best describes horror movies of today-everything has been done before. Then Tony Todd shows up looking like a lead in gay version of Phantom of The Opera. Wow, two good horror actors wasted in one film with pointless cameos. The film is slow even though the characters are cliched, I still enjoyed the two fighting ladies who are doing a porno and the black guy was funny. The killings are enjoyable but when I read the headline ""Old School American Horror"", they should have used a make up artist like Tom Savani to do the gore instead of a computer. I like the horror films of 70's and 80's because they didn't use computers and it looked better and more realistic. I still like horror movies with computer graphics but not when it comes to most slasher movies. Kane Hodder did a good job as the killer but nothing could save this movie.

The current trend seems to stuck on translating Japanese horror for American audiences.  While this worked at first, it has grown stale.  Hatchet is a return to a more ""classic"" slasher film, something that outside the 70's and early 80's isn't done well or often anymore.

The acting isn't necessarily the best outside Kane Hodder.  The story is just enough to set the stage.  There is blood and plenty of it, as well as a few novel deaths.  The mix of dark comedy and horror works in my opinion.  The extra features are a nice treat, especially watching Kane Hodder scare the cast.

Well, maybe my expectations were a bit too high, even for a slasher film. I didn't expect it to be as quirky. I wanted it to be darker. I didn't mind the poor story and acting. You expect those with any slasher film.

One thing I loved was the effects. No CGI involved. This was a true classic slasher if for no other reason. One scene in particular I'm certain any slasher fanatic will love (and they even have a special feature that's shown how it's down, without CGI).

If you're not a fan of classic horror, this movie isn't for you. If you're into torture/victim horror, this isn't for you. If you wonder what would happen if they made a classic horror movie today, then Hatchet is the one to see.

I'll admit that I wasn't blown away by the plotline, or acting; very predictable stuff here. The effects were great, though Crowley's make-up job was a little campy. I think it had to be in order for this to work though. No CG-infected gore either. Hatchet chose to go to the roots of what make a classic a classic: a scary ""monster,"" a wooded area, brief nudity, predicable plot, stereotypical characters, an opening for a sequel. They did a good job, here. Was nothing spectacular, nothing groundbreaking, but it's a movie.

Though I love the classics, they're classic for a reason. They gave us the foundation for stuff that comes out today.

Hatchet didn't do that. You knew who was going to die and who would survive. The backstory could have been left out, as it was predicable to the plot.

Despite what I didn't like about it, the movie wasn't terrible. Good to see Kane Hodder out of make-up. Good to see Robert England too, wrinkles and all. The special features were pretty good, giving us insight as to how the movie was made and why. As the film ended, I kept saying to myself: ""Please don't make a sequel to this one.

3299411,2,B0011FLM00,"This low-budget indie film is generally a hatchet job. Its only redeeming virtue is the few glimpses it offers of daytime New Orleans Bourbon Street festivities.

Well, there's also the ""Behind-the-Scenes"" look at the making of the movie included in the DVD bonus features. This is almost more entertaining than the movie itself. The filmmakers' obvious enthusiasm for their project is infectious. And they do offer one potentially valuable tip for the makers of future horror flicks. They tell how they didn't let any of the to-be-terrorized-actors see the psychopathic menace who would be threatening them on screen - until the creature actually burst upon them in the makeshift swamps with the cameras rolling. The individual playing the ""hatchet man"" kept a low profile among his fellow actors, and like a bride on her wedding day, certainly never let any of the others see him in his costume beforehand.

This would be an interesting, effective technique, in cases where the hatchet-wielding menace isn't so ludicrous.

One warning about this film's maniac: His presence might be offensive to some people. He is given a back-story involving early abuse, deformity, and retardation. I'm surprised that advocates for various challenged groups don't protest that easy equation between retardation and mania. I thought such stereotypes had been put to rest a long time ago. In the same vein, I'm surprised that West Virginia citizens never protested the ""Backwoods"" movie franchise dealing with savage inbred clans of subhuman mountain dwellers.

But then, most likely these movies were deemed too insignificant to warrant protest. You'd probably do well to similarly deem at least this movie too insignificant to warrant your time.",1206144000,,1733,5.290909090909091

First off, the dialogue is horrendous and the actors delivering it are horrible.  There are no likeable characters.  There is nothing to care about in the entire film's running time.  Second, what the heck was up with the sets?  Ninety-five percent of the film is set outdoors and never for a moment do you believe that they are outside.  Everything looks like a set.  It looks exactly like the actors are in a swimming pool surrounded by plastic plants.  Pathetic.  Third,  the killer AKA Victor Crowley just wasn't that interesting.  I found his makeup to be pretty crappy looking.  Some of the gore was okay(i.e. the head ripping scene) but some of it was just pathetic(i.e. the first kill and its completely fake looking arm ripping).

Overall, I feel that director Adam Green faked out both myself and the entire horror community with two years of hype over a movie that was just awful.

A group of college guys are partying at Mardi Gras. The most sensitive of the bunch, having recently broke up with his longtime girlfriend, would rather take a ""haunted swamp"" tour than get drunk and watch young women expose themselves.  His best buddy doesn't feel the same way, but agrees to go on the tour of the swamp.

While on the tour, the passengers are forced to fight for their lives after the boat sinks and they are pursued by a disfigured axe murderer.

The attempts at humor cancel out the attempts at suspense. Full of cliches, the whole movie get tedious after about 45 minutes.  The gore is cheap and fake looking.  The acting is actually better than you might expect for a movie like this.  Plenty of gratuitous topless women througout, which is at least something.

Slasher movie buffs may be impressed by some iconic actors turning up for small roles. Tony Todd has a fun cameo as a former swamp tour guide who's business was shut down by a lawsuit.  Robert Englund has a less inspired cameo, and Kane Hodder plays the disfigured bad guy.",1205971200,7,1135,4.635

The basic plot is that a group of strangers find themselves taking a ""haunted"" swamp tour in the murky wilderness of New Orleans. The group also includes a ""girls gone wild"" character who is using his video camera to film two girls being playfully naughty on the trip - excellent humour here.

The find themselves stranded on the murky swamps and have to save themselves from the reincarnation of a deformed man who was accidentally killed by his father many years in the past.

The film has some excellent frights, including parts that actually made me jump in my seat, which is rare for me in a horror movie. The gore is intense at times with blood splattering across the screen and splashing against trees of the bayou. The camera work on the action sequences is really well done - you'll find out in the documentary that they used a steadycam for the majority of the shooting - very impressive.

Will the group be able to save themselves from the mutant???

The disc also includes a pretty funny gag reel, and an excellent (and lengthy) featurette of the making of the movie which is well worth viewing to learn about the director/producers, and see some interviews with the cast. They also show how many of the gorey scenes were done, which is fun to watch.

There is a bit of camp and humour in the movie, but it never distracts from the basic horror plot, and at the end of the movie we were smiling.

OK, so it's New Orleans, and it's Mardi Gras.  Show some boobies and move on.  We didn't need one of the characters filming a `Girls Gone Wild' movie with two hookers pulling up their shirts and flashing boobies every two minutes.

The  film then took a bad turn.  It tried to be funny.  But it wasn't.  I didn't laugh.  `Shawn of the Dead' was a spoof, a good one, that made me laugh.  Hatchet needed to make up its mind to be a spoof or a serious slasher flick.  Either go for the joke-jugular, or be scary.

Unlike the 'Scream' movies, no victim was done away in any `spoofy' ways.  If they had, it would have certified Hatchet's 'spoofiness', and at the same time been a truly imaginative homage to both slasher pics and the 'Scream' spoofs.

The special effects were lame, too.  Red syrup pumping out of beheaded torsos, and rubbery mannikins being ripped to bloody shreds.  'Evil Dead' looked like 'Avatar' compared to this.

The monster/slayer was trite and predictable---not alive, not dead, but not a ghost either.  Copying Jason and Michael Meyers, he took a lickin' and kept on tickin', stunned when shot or burned or pitchforked, then reviving in time to grab the girl's ankle.

Worst of all he didn't have that trademark gimmick (e.g., coveralls, hockey mask or long, razor-sharp finger knives) that the big-time slashers have.  He was just ugly and doofus-looking and wore a plaid flannel shirt. Yawn.

3299430,2,B0011FLM00,"Hallelujah, it's raining Men!

Oh, and women too. Literally.

Pity poor, monstrous, ruined, bloodthirsty Victor Crowley (the great Kane Hodder, channeling Eric Stoltz from ""Mask""): born into this cruel and grasping age looking for all the world like a pig with Down's Syndrome stuck by a mad scientist into a combination blender/teleporter with the little unwanted mutant baby from ""Eraserhead"".

Born into this! Yes, Born into this!, as Bukowski once said. And then smacked in the face with a hatchet because he had a really bad case of ADHD (they parented differently back then, spare the rod and all).

Supposedly he's dead, but the Cajun fishermen tell tales of hearing him cry out for this father from the ruins of their little abandoned cabin up in the cypress swamps on a moonless night.

""Hatchet"" bills itself as ""old school American horror"", and its eye-catching publicity posters (and DVD art) promised as much: the starkness of the hatchet front and center, its stony, unyielding surface smeared with sticky red blood, a primal sigil of destruction, all sharp, hard, brutal lethality contrasted against a backdrop of inky night.

That might suggest simplicity, starkness, perhaps raw terror, to you. It might suggest raw, primal grue. Perhaps a stripped down screenplay, a kind of rippling, insurgent savagery and, Hell, mebbe even a scare or two. You might be forgiven for thinking this was something new, something revolutionary; I did.

We would be wrong.

""Hatchet"" is to Scary what a palace eunuch is to Macho. It is a deeply, deeply stupid movie, that manages to 1) take the relatively simple horror movie chore---deliver the boneheaded cardboard characters to the swampy anvil of death---and transform it into an hour of painfully contrived, brain-blasting tedium; 2) squander the talents of horror vets Robert Englund and Tony Todd in scenes both tedious and cringingly unfunny. The first hour of ""Hatchet"" is the cinematic equivalent of injecting yourself into ""Flowers for Algernon"": you can just feel yourself getting stupider.

But once the psycho fodder hits the swampy turf---& the resident Psycho (played to beefy, uh, perfection bybeefy psycho vet Kane Hodder) shows up to, er, bury the Hatchet---things get redder, and goopier, and gorier.

You're missing nothing if you just FF to the goods: the sheer, unapologetic brutality of the flick (chick! hiya! chick, meet drill sander!), and the generous helpings of the goopy red stuff, at which it's pretty much by the numbers & on the bounce: psycho fodder shriekds, runs and hides. Mutant freak finds, slices, and dices. Rinse, repeat.

Bottom line: all the marks I take away for the sheer blain-blasting stupidity of this thing, I must restore for sheer enthusiasm. Sheer, wild-eyed, gore & brain splattered exuberance counts for a lot in jihad, porn, and horror movies, and Adam Green delivers it in spades once his monster shows up with his own rendition of the Big Easy.

If nothing else, it's worth checking out just to see what amounts to a fully ambulatory, totally ripped Elephant Man in overalls come bounding down a bridle path, hatchet in hand rendered teeny by the Beast's gigantism, and give a little Tomahawk Chop right to the ol' shoulder-blade of some shrieking geezer. And what a Chop!

Anyway for all the goop and gore, this film also has a great message. Three of them, in fact:

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #1: if it's raining in New Olreans and all the levee done broke and we got no place to go, brotha, they's worse places to be (like in da Hootchee swamp with a hatchet wielding maniac out).

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #2: There are worse things in Louisiana than Katrina, FEMA, and gators.

HATCHET GREAT MORAL #3: When you were a kid did ya get hit with the Ugly Stick? Get even---get a sharper one and hit back!

Hatchet is a spoof of 80's slasher flicks that also pays great homage to the genre, and stars Joel David Moore (Dodgeball, Grandma's Boy) as one of the unlucky group of tourists taking a boat tour in the backwoods swamps of the bayou during Mardi Gras.  Next thing you know, our group is picked off by the deformed, invincible, and superhumanly strong Victor Crowley (played by none other than Jason Voorhees himself, Kane Hodder) in some deliriously gorey manners.  While Hatchet doesn't offer anything new to the genre, writer and director Adam Green is having a sheer blast, as is the rest of the cast (including Deon Richmond, Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Angel vet Mercedes McNab, and horror icons Tony ""Candyman"" Todd and Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund), and the gore effects by John Carl Buechler are superb.

To sum it up, mixed group of people (you already knew the ones who were going to get killed) go in the swamps, meet psycho, psycho kills them.  The killings are also very explicit and very over the top, but maybe that's the audience Anchor Bay was shooting for, people who NEED to see blood and gore to be scared or think it's ""cool"".

The film is relatively short and the plot is focused in the 2nd half on who can escape the swamp before being grotesquely slain by the killer.  There isn't really that much in the way of surprises or clever dialogue except for a few spots such as when a few of the characters are revealed as having been less than honest about themselves.

The first thing in ""Hatchet"" is Robert Englund playing ""Paw"" to his son in a swamp, delivering homophobic dialog and being a pipe smoking slack jawed mouth breathing redneck. Son needs to pee, really really bad. Daddy calls him gay slur. Both get killed. Cue Marilyn Manson song. Things don't get much better afterwards.

Giving this three stars is generous. After the pathetic set-up, the homage to 80's slasher films kicks in. The usual crew of characters (nerdy lovelorn guy, token wisecracking African American, a pair of slutty chicks and a few other assorted pieces of meat) get lost in a swamp where it was illegal to be in the first place. Hot chick Mary Beth (Tamara Feldman) is revealed to be on the tour boat because she is looking for ""Paw"" and her brother - and it seems the redneck idiot gene bypassed her in the uterus. It is Mary Beth who explains the curse of Victor Crowley (another 80's horror vet, Kane Hodder), who then starts picking off the tourists in grizzly manners.

However, for viewers immunized to CGI-torture gross-outs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turistas/dp/B000N3AW6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turistas</a>, the gallons of ketchup, grape jelly and chocolate syrup air-pressure sprayed throughout ""Hatchet"" will seem lame. It is where I actually gave ""Hatchet"" the benefit of the doubt, because they made a serious effort to do old-school scary by spending most of their minuscule budget on latex body doubles to hack and fake blood in copious amounts instead of relying on animated computer effects to dub it in later. The bodies are used exploitively, especially the Mardis Gras bead slinging scenes at the beginning. Bad comic lines are thrown about (mainly by Dean Richmond as Marcus, who gets all the 'token' Chris Tucker/Chris Rock type jokes). It makes ""Hatchet"" a movie made by horror-movie geeks that tries valiantly to match the 70's and 80's movies they must have lapped up as film-school nerds, even if they regurgitated a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B0002JP572/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;script with no form other than function and some foul stereotypes for characters.

After all, even a monster has to have a reason to go slicing up pretty girls with power tools. Victor Crowley just is a kid who misses his daddy and then kills anyone who gets on his turf. You never really find out why he kills; he's just one angry dude in a roided out Elephant Man costume. The film scoots along predictably, and the two kids you pretty much guess will survive do so. The twist is nice but obvious at the end, and of course there is talk on the extras and commentaries about ""Hatchet 2.""

3299442,4,B0011FLM00,"I found this movie to be totally enjoyable, on a number of levels. I don't know if it classifies as a horror/comedy- it's a slasher flick with humor in it. And the humor in it is hilarious. Adam Green, the writer/ director, and all of the cast did an excellent job at getting both laughs and screams. And the characters were individuals who were portrayed sympathetically, unlike the cookie-cutter characters typical of teen slasher flicks. The killings were extremely inventive, and the gore effects were wonderful. The monster, Victor Crowley, is a cool movie monster who I have a feeling we will be seeing more of. The photography and visual effects were beautiful.

The plot is pretty simple: a group of 8 (not all teens) are in New Orleans and decide to go on a ""haunted swamp boat tour"". The boat sinks, and the group finds themselves stranded in the swamp with a hatchet-wielding maniac. Predictably, they get knocked off one by one, although nothing else is that predictable. Horror fans will be thrilled to see Robert Englund, Tony Todd, and Kane Hodder in the movie. The funniest dialogue may come from the two ""bimbos"", who are supposedly making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" style video with an older, sleazy photographer.

Most horror films being made right now are meant to scare, suprise, and shock people. Hatchet seems to try and make people laugh and show ridiculous splatter effects. If the purpose that you are trying to accomplish is different, you can't really compare it to movies like ""Halloween"", ""The Descent"", or ""Saw"". I happen to like horror movies that set out to scare and suprise you, so this horror movie was just not something I like to see.

The movie does not, as others have noted, have a good balance between the comedy and the horror. I think in most any horror movie you need a little comic relief to break the tension so you can take a breath. This flick attempts too much comedy interspersed with the horror. 5 minutes of scrapped humor in the script would have made a world of difference.

Overall though it was a fairly tolerable movie and I would have gladly pulled cables on the set for free just to watch the process unfold. The ripped head shot was excellent and my definite favorite of the kills.

It definitely delivers on the gore and the sudden scares. It delivers a little bit of sleaze with all the boob shots in New Orleans and also between our two naive female characters shooting for Hollywood.

If you are looking for a marvelous revamping of the genre then this might disappoint you. If you are in the 35 and over crowd looking for the type of movie that you grew up with,lots of physical horror effects and no CGI, with then this is a excellent revisit of the era albeit a little cheesey.

The movie is less than 90 minutes long. It is one of the shortest horror movies I've watched in a long time.

The back blurb says it is a comedy/horror. It is not. This is supposed to be serious. I saw no comedy in it at all.

On the plus side: The ending may not be original, but few horror movies do what this one did. I liked the ending a lot! In fact, that boost the rating up one star from me.

The gore factor is way over the top...there are scenes where you can just picture someone on the set just throwing an entire bucket of blood on a tree.  Death scenes are innovative and Victor Crowley is fairly scary considering the campy nature of the film.

3299449,3,B0011FLM00,"This film clearly had great potential, but failed to live up to the hype.  I rented HATCHET solely due to its highly aggressive marketing campaign, in which numerous reviewers gushed about how HATCHET was the best film they'd seen in years.  Okay, I guess that means it won't suck, right?  After watching it, though, I felt betrayed, resentful, and wanted my $4 back.

After 24 hours had passed, I deigned to view the special features . . . which, surprisingly, were better than the film itself, and allowed me to feel sympathy and compassion for the cast and crew, who really came across as likeable, talented, and professional.  There's no way I can bring myself to berate such nice people even after viewing this sub-par film; so, after some reflection, my review is as follows:

HATCHET started out strong -- first, the brutal murders of the idiot fishermen; followed by a number of outstanding shots in the recreation of ""Mardi Gras"" filmed on location on Bourbon Street.  Unfortunately, the film rapidly goes downhill from there.  The screenplay was quite possibly the worst that I'd ever been subjected to, with plot holes, continuity errors, technical errors, credibility errors, ineptitude, and general suckitude -- the story made no sense whatsoever, and compelled fellow audience members to shout abusive comments and fling various food products at the screen . . . making this a TOP CHOICE for selection by the likes of Mystery Science Theater 3000.  This screenplay DESERVES heaps of abusive criticism -- so long as said criticism is done in a humorous manner and contributes to further ""enjoyment"" of the film.  Awful, awful writing.

That being said, the casting was brilliant, and the acting was quite good.  Huge kudos to Kane Hodder for utilizing PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE techniques against the unfortunate cast to terrorize them FOR REAL so that their on-screen ""fear"" was not an act.  He is an innovator as well as a creative genius, and you really must see the special features on this disc to appreciate this fact.

The ""monster"" costume Hodder wore was well made, allowing us to actually see the monster numerous times throughout the film.  The f/x were very good, with the exception of the actual blood itself.  The blood being sprayed around seemed far too thin, light, and watery . . . they really should've experimented with a variety of formulas as well as dispersion methods.  While a few scenes were dead-on, others looked incredibly cheesey and fake.

I do acknowledge that this was apparently a ""homage"" as well as a ""spoof"" of classic 80's slasher flicks . . . but I did not realize this upon renting it.  ""Old School American Horror"" is not the phrase I would've chosen to market what is clearly a spoof film, and I rightfully feel misled by that prominent tagline.

I always watch the credits at the end, and wish that some credit would've been given to at least a dozen of the more prominent ""Mardi Gras"" revelers, who did more than the average ""extra"" and in a few cases were given their own exclusive shot.  It is a shame that these fine folks (many of whom were crew members or even producers) were uncredited, while the 3 kids with no lines standing around for 5 seconds with Halloween masks got their names in the credits.

Is Victor Crowley a zombie?  How did he transform from malnourished fearful retard with a head injury to lumbering psychopathic powerlifter?  Was it really Victor Crowley, or some sort of mutant space alien?  And how can he still sprint, swing an axe, throw people around, and hold his breath while swimming underwater after having been shot in the chest with a .45 ACP slug, stabbed, chopped, burned, and impaled?  Did victor Crowley have a secret stash of Quik Clot and methamphetamine?  This was an INCREDIBLY STUPID MOVIE . . . but it did have its good points.

My advice would be to watch the special features FIRST, then view the film with the commentary track running.  If you just start watching the movie cold, expecting the ""Old School Slasher Film"" it was relentlessly hyped as being, you are guaranteed to be disappointed.  This was a fairly good spoof of said slasher films, though.",1200787200,,4157,4.805907172995781

But on the other hand, the plot makes this movie highly forgettable. It will not stand beside the classics it was trying to pay homage to.

There is absolutely no reason to take this movie seriously, and to critique it in such a way would take all the fun out of it.

Victor's father accidentally killed him with a hatchet while trying to get through the door to save him. now he wanders those same woods and swamps looking to dish out some pain in return for his own.

starts off with a relatively traditional horror intro (you know what im talking about)

cut to a couple days later. the main character(""villain"" from Grandma's Boy! also in Accepted) of this movie is highly unhappy at Mardi Gras and looks into a haunted swamp tour for some alternative entertainment. most of the characters are fairly cliched. you got the paris hiltonish girls (eh), the hero, the token back dude, the sensitive guy, the completely helpless old couple, and the sleaze. traditionally, it doesnt take too long for the chaos to begin.

a fairly over-used formula at this point, but just like ""The Tripper"", ""Hatchet"" manages to be supremely entertaining with an extremely interesting kill or two thrown in for good measure. plenty of blood and guts to satisfy any horror fan, but probably not grisly enough for the most jaded of gore hounds. kills with nothing but bare hands, kills with the ominous hatchet, and a power tool may even just get thrown in there. the action does not disappoint. while i didn't find it genuinely scarey at any moment (they hardly ever are), you feel a little tension at times, it has very satisfying death sequences(victor can be so creative!) and some surprisingly good humor, its an extremely entertaining horror movie. recommended to fans of the genre, especially slasher fans. most others won't get it.",1200614400,23,2136,4.843835616438356

The first couple of minutes and the last were too formula for me but the rest shined.  As I watched entrails flash onscreen in the beginning, I thought here's just another cheesy slasher film.  But then it did something wonderful, it became original.

Yeah, it has five college buddies in Mardi Gras with girls flashing their boobs for beads but it gets better quick.  One of them (suffering from a broken heart) decides to go on this spooky swamp tour and his best bud decides to go along with him.  Their first attempt at booking a swamp tour is hilarious.  The Voodoo Shop owner tells them he no longer does night tours because of the ""Accident"".  The two guys as well as the viewer expect one thing but get another.  This sets the tone for the movie, it does not always go as expected, and I loved it.  They finally find a night swamp tour and set out for the adventure along with an older couple who are the typical tourists, some guy filming two girls that flash their breasts on cue (think ""girls gone wild""), and a loner chick.  Most actors are recognizable from tv show stints.

The tour guide is inept and the boat soon gets in trouble.  Here we learn about the local legend, Victor Crowley, who was a deformed child taken care of by his father in a shack by the swamp.  The movie provides a good solid boogieman for the audience.  The legend is that if you go near the house at night, Victor comes back to life and gets you.  Let the gorefest start as the group gets stuck in the swampland.  Be prepared for a lot of gore but not as disturbing as say, Hostel or Saw.

A lot of those movies were bad enough to make you laugh.  Hatchet is different because the director wanted us to laugh at how bad it is.

Those who can appreciate spoof movies or bad movies that are unintentionally funny will find a lot to enjoy here.  If you also like gore, even better.  Still, if you're looking for a movie that is either a horror classic or a movie masterpiece, you will find yourself scratching your head and missing the point.  Watch this alone and the critical lens of intelligence may cloud your view.  But watch this with a group and before long you are bound to be laughing hysterically between disgusted ""ooohs.""

Acting and Direction

The acting is at times good and sometimes really bad, yet it is all done intentionally to throw you off and remind you what a spoof this is.  The direction is even more off-putting, with uncomfortable close-ups and some moments that leave you thinking, ""why didn't they get another take?""  Still after a while you realize that too was done on purpose.  Anybody who was a fan of Ed Wood will understand this.

The Story

For this movie, the director creates the legend of Victor Crowley, a New Orleans youth who returns from the dead seeking blood and revenge. Some dumb tourists decide to take a swamp tour at a really bad time, and you can probably guess what happens next.

The simple silly story is meant to be a throwback to 80s horror, but they throw in lots of horny tweens, a forced love-interest story, and plenty of nudity to round out the clich&eacute;s.  The sprinkled-in one-liners are usually funny enough to give you a chuckle once you catch on.

DVD Extras

The special features make this DVD, and might have a longer running time than the actual movie if watched back to back. There are 5 special features. The ""Making Of"" feature is probably the best.  It goes way beyond the usual filler that comes with DVDs.  It actually includes useful information that aspiring spoof film makers could learn from and use.  You know, the stuff DVD extras are supposed to include.

""Meeting Victor Crowley"" is about the actor who plays Crowley, Kane Hodder.  He is one of the three actors with parts in the film who has a history as a horror icon.

The very sloppy special effects are explored in the ""Guts & Gore"" feature.  Similarly, ""Anatomy of a Kill"" explores shooting one of the movie's kill sequences. Finally, ""A Twisted Tale"" is completely out of left field.  It explores the director's obsession with Twisted Sister. Beyond that there are the DVD extra standards, such as a Gag Reel and director's commentary.

Conclusion

Overall, this is a fun and entertaining movie. This one is best watched with a group of like minded people who can suspend the use of their brains and just enjoy.  Aspiring film-makers and fans of Ed Wood will find owning the DVD worthwhile for the extras.

And you have to admit, ""Hatchet"" never pretends to be anything it's not -- a horror movie in the classic slasher vein, with lots of blood and dismemberment. Adam Green doesn't do anything we haven't seen before, but he does it with such gleeful enjoyment. And gloriously satirical dialogue (""Your nipples are dumb!"").

A bunch of guys are at Mardi Gras, enjoying the beer, beads and breasts. Ben (Joel Moore) is depressed about a recent breakup, so he decides to drag his pal Marcus (Deon Richmond) on a haunted boat trip. Since the main guides no longer do night tours, Ben and Marcus end up on a tiny boat with two dumb tourists, two softcore porn actresses, their ""producer,"" and a mystery girl with a gun.

But then the newbie guide accidentally runs them into a rock, and they run afoul of gaters. And then Marybeth (Tamara Feldman) reveals the horrifying truth -- she's there to find her brother and father, who vanished in this same swamp. Supposedly it's haunted by the ghost of Victor Crowley, a horribly deformed boy who was accidentally killed by his father during a fire.

Of course, nobody buys this until a grotesque creature comes jumping out of the old Crowley house and hacks up the tourists with a hatchet. Terrified, the people go running through the woods, with Victor hot in pursuit -- and their only hope of escape is to get back to New Orleans. But how can they escape someone who cannot be killed?

Again, this has all been done before -- think ""Halloween"" meets ""Friday the 13th,"" with dashes of other horror classics thrown in there. But you know, that's good -- Green is just trying to make a funny, gory, entertaining horror movie without pretensions. And no, the black guy and the slut are not the first ones to die (just for your info).

The first half of the movie is basically buildup and murky bayou atmosphere. Then Victor starts dismembering people, and from then on it's all about people running around shrieking, and getting killed off one by one. That would be a bit boring after awhile, but Green keeps it interesting by throwing in a few twists -- and the last scene will make you hide under your bed.

Along the way, we have ripped-off heads, chainsaw murders, buckets of gore, and lots of gruesome deaths shown in bloody detail. But to keep things from ever getting too serious, there's some bleak comedy (including Marcus' gradual fall from a tree). Most of it comes from the feuding porn girls (""Are you sure the number is 911?""), but there are some priceless lines from other characters (""He fell into the water... hit his head... and... SUED ME FOR NEGLIGENCE! That C***SUCKER!"").

All the actors do nice solid jobs in their roles -- Moore is a likable nice guy who inexplicably keeps his head in a crisis, and Richmond is fun as the guy who REALLY didn't want to go on this. Feldman really rules the story as the feisty, grim love interest, but all the actors are good -- and Mercedes McNab and Joleigh Fioreavanti are a riot.

As for the bad guy? Well, Kane Hodder (aka Jason Vorhees) makes a wonderfully grotesque slasher villain, looking like an orc with a hunchback. Given his backstory, you'd feel sorry for the guy if he weren't trying to carve everyone into lunch meat. And note to horror geeks -- keep an eye out for Tony Todd/Candyman, playing a very POed ""Reverend Zombie.""

""Hatchet"" is all unpretentious gore and dismemberment -- and hilarious love note to classic slasher horror. Funny, crazy, and not terribly complex.",1200441600,12,3624,4.675039246467818

3299460,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is a campy, over-the-top spoof of the horror genre. It takes all the trite cliches associated with horror movies and exaggerates them. A group of people go on a boat ghost tour in the Louisiana bayou only to find out that the area they're in is haunted by a ghost (who sounds startingly similar to Jason Voorhies). Naked women abound, profanity is the status quo, and the dumb blonde heroine is the funniest character in the ensemble cast. Overall, the movie is so so. But if you like camp, go ahead and watch it. Don't go into it hoping for an amazing movie, because it isn't. The best part of this movie is seeing actors like Rudy's friend from the Cosby Show, the guy who played the Candyman, and--of course--Freddy Krueger all joined in this C-list thriller. This film is more or less the place where has-been actors go to let their careers die.",1200441600,,857,4.535483870967742
3299461,5,B0011FLM00,"Whilst the film is called by the weapon, it is used in malice by Victor Crowley only once, and Victor has an accidental wound from the Hatchet. The rest of the Deaths and mayhem are done in an array of creative and lovingly ratcheted FX shots
 The film splices together an original story, some good performances, and an all-star production group that makes this film pop from the start. Robert Englund is there mainly as star bait, since he is gone inside of a few minutes, but it is the disappearance of his character that drives one side of the film story. In true Robert Englund form, he has one of the most extravagant deaths. From there, the story is mostly Comedy, Characters, and ( alternating almost) some incredibly creative deaths FX/Gags in recent Cinema. Supposedly the Director did not want any CGI in the Deaths, but he admits in the commentary to using CGI
for rain, so how do we know ?
 Anyways, Kane Hodder plays an awesomely brutal Character that the Director allegedly dreamed up at Age 8. As one would expect with a ""low Budget"" film, Kane plays the Father of Victor, as well as the Grown Victor( Kane Hodder is an established Actor having some Great roles in WISHMASTER, and at least one of the later Jason Films). It is never stated if Victor is a Supernatural being or what, since the story says Victor was Killed at a young Age. Anyways, Splice in a little Tony
Todd Flamboyance, some Sensual elements( Hardly Eye-popping nudity), and this film is a solid proof that an unrated film is the Defacto gold Standard in any film genre.

DVD EXTRAS: The film runs for 78 Minutes, the jacket lists 84, but its 6 mins of credits). The extras really make this package. They tell not only how the film itself was made, but how Dee Snyder Made an impact on the Directors life, and it would seem, how the Director made an impact on Dee's life. The Extras include a breakdown of a FX  Shot where a womans
head is  ""affected"" ( if you know DEMON KNIGHT, 1995 film, you already have a Good Idea of the FX, but maybe not how it was done; the similarities are surprising); anyway, no detraction from the Gag here, since the effect of the FX is different, especially the way Kane performs it.
 I would not be surprised if a sequel is spawned, since Kane Hodder and the Production group make this Horror work well; Now, for my money, I'd like to see a Big Supernatural element arise.",1200441600,3,2388,4.465596330275229
3299462,4,B0011FLM00,"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip that started from this bayou port aboard this tiny ship. The guide was a mighty stupid man; the hero was sullen and depressed. Nine passengers set sail that night for a haunted bayou tour, for spirit and ghouls.

The weather started to rain, the tiny ship was stuck. If not for the courage of the hard to get chick the tourist would be sunk, the tourist would be gator food.

The passengers set ground on the shore of this deserted haunted house with the dude from Dodgeball, The Token Black Guy too, an old dude and his wife, the wannabe movie star the pornographer and the chick from Angel, here in the movie Hatchet.

Hatchet bills itself as ""not a remake, it's not a sequel, and it's not based on a Japanese one. Old school American horror."" The problem with old school American horror is that it was basically destroyed by the Scream franchise that let everyone in on the rules of the genre. But Hatchet doesn't care if you know the rules, if fact you can pretty much guess the death order once the ship sets sail. It is more about the character that have no problem to crack one-liners even as some deformed dude bears down on them and killing them is some outrageous ways which are more Mortal Combat than Saw.

The movie has a horror pedigree having Freddy Krueger, Candyman, and Jason Voorhees (at least the dude who played him four of the eleven (?) times) all making appearances in the movie. The movie is far from perfect, you can't help but think of Mask when you first see the killer and the ending is frustrating in a The Sopranos, did my power just go out, kind of way. But Hatchet is one of the more enjoyable horror movies of the past decade.",1200441600,2,1729,4.3602484472049685
3299463,4,B0011FLM00,"""Old fashioned"" may be a relative term regarding horror movies, of whom I count myself a fan. But it gets harder and harder to find something I can really watch; unlike a lotta newbies to the genre, I really don't want to find the most bloody and realistic depiction of chainsaw massacres.

I like horror movies that surprise, that are clever, that are pure escapism. The worst and most horrific blood and gore isn't my idea of a horror movie. That's just stupid, or maybe I should say adolescent (which is why it's adolescent boys who constantly yammer for more and more.)

Hatchet is made for folks like me: people who remember when going to a horror movie was FUN, and not just an exercise in blood and gore.

Don't get me wrong, though. There's plenty of blood and gore in Hatchet, but it's the fake kind, and yeah, that's on purpose. The liner notes (so to speak) say this movie was created as a paen to 80s-type horror movies, and that is definitely true.

But Adam Green, the writer and director, wanted to make a movie that would be an updated version of 80s-style slashfests. He succeeded admirably.

The movie is just fun. One of the rules of these type of movies is that anyone who has sex is gonna GET it. And yeah, they do. There are two slutty chicks, one a Valley girl, and the other a faux NYU acting school graduate with pretensions of ""art"" who are making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" soft porn movie with a sleazy director. There is the boring older couple, constantly invoking the name of Jayzus; the requisite black guy with great expressions; a Chinese or Korean or Filipino guy (our token Asian) who also pretends to be a Cajun tour guide; and the hero, the resident geek.

The heroine is a plucky southern chick, combing the swamp for her white trash daddy and brother (parts filled respectively with 80s horror icon Robert Englund, otherwise known as Freddie from Nightmare on Elm Street and Joshua Leonard, the guy whose teeth turned up in a bag of rags and twigs in 'Blair Witch Project.')

Hatchet is cliche-ridden, and freaking funny and fun as hell. The extras with this DVD are fun, too (which is amazing, since it's so rare to get DVD extras that actually are as good as the movie!)

Totally recommended for the 80s horror flick fan!",1200441600,,2256,4.525798525798526
3299464,2,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet's tag line of ""Old School American Horror"" intrigued me, especially since the films the genre has been putting out for the last 15 years have been mainly about shock rather than true horror.  Unfortunately, the tagline likely refers to the fact that Hatchet is basically a rehashing of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th/dp/B00001MXXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th</a>&nbsp;The basic premise is that a group of people go into the woods on a boat tour, hear a story of a boy who took a hatchet to his deformed face and then became a ghost. Of course the boy has grown into the killer and proceeds to attack them.  The only thing different between this and Friday the 13th is that the killer doesn't wait until they're alone to attack.

hatchet isn't a horrible movie, and if you've never seen ""Friday the 13th"" you might enjoy it.  But for everyone else it will just seem like a cheap rip-off that doesn't add anything to the original story.",1200441600,3,1030,5.300613496932515
3299465,2,B0011FLM00,"In short, Hatchet is your typical amateur slasher flick, with a superhuman, ugly bad guy chasing and killing annoying teenagers (for no good reason). By the way, ""annoying teenagers"" might be the understatement of the year when it comes to this film. Adam green (writer and director) was trying to go back to the old style horror flicks of the 1980's, but this movie seems so typical of our contemporary horror films (with hot chicks and ridiculous violence/gore).

Hatchet is real amateur (straight to video) stuff. For example, the movie opens up showing a mardi-gras parade, but there is no parade and only about 50 extras. However, a couple good actors such as Tony Todd (from the Night of the living dead, REMAKE) appear briefly in the film.

The most enjoyable part of this DVD is the extras. I enjoyed Adam Greens story about meeting Dee Snyder. I also enjoyed his commentary with the other actors. You can tell he is a nice guy with a lot of passion for making movies. It would be nice if someone like Quentin Tarantino would take him under his wing and teach him character development.",1200441600,7,1094,4.692708333333333
3299466,4,B0011FLM00,"Nerdy Ben is tired of all the debauchery he's seen at Mardi Gras, and talks his wise-acre pal Marcus into joining him on the ""Haunted Swamp Night Tour"" (all together now, say, ""Don't go!!"")  They join a collection of clueless tourists that includes a porn-maker and his actresses and a beautiful, mysterious young lady.  Right on cue, the tour boat starts to sink - in the rain and in the dark - and our little band of thrillseekers is trudging through the bayou, which, as everyone knows, is the home of crazed killer Victor Crowley, also known as Hatchet.

This slasher flick is better than most because there is plenty of humor, courtesy of Ben and Marcus and the porn queens, and it doesn't take itself too seriously; Ben and Marcus are the kind of guys who would make wise cracks all through a movie like this.  There's a sympathetic killer with a good backstory and the one-by-one killings are all done differently and, mercifully, quickly.  If you like things that go bump in the night and bloody body parts flying all over, this is the movie for you.

It's low-budget, with the requisite low-budget acting and ""special"" effects and gore. I appreciate that Hatchet is supposed to be a spoof, but it's just not quite awful enough to be bad/funny -- it's just bad/bad.

Hatchet is somewhat amusing but misses the mark.",1200355200,4,372,4.6923076923076925
3299468,3,B0011FLM00,"Joel Moore (Grandma's Boy, Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning) stars as Ben, just another young guy visiting New Orleans during Mari Gras with his buddies and not enjoying it in the least. He manages to convince his best friend Marcus to join him on a haunted boat tour through the swamp one night in an effort to make a change of pace from the flashing girls on Bourbon Street that only remind him of his recently exed girlfriend. The pair soon find themselves riding on a tour bus to the swamp with a clueless guide and six other tourists. Unbeknownst to the others, however, is that one attractive, young passenger is taking the tour with an ulterior motive. She is on a mission to discover what has happened to her missing father and brother, both of whom disappeared while alligator hunting two nights before. All she has to go on though, is the local legend of Victor Crowley, a malformed creature seeking revenge on humanity for the cruelty that led to his accidental death as a child and that of his heartbroken father.

""Hatchet"" is a pretty cut and dry slasher tale that has received some overly gracious hype. A group of boat tour passengers and their guide get lost in the outdoors and are viciously murdered one by one. It's an enjoyable ride for the most part. The cast list is pretty impressive, even if the bigger names are just cameos. Those people you may not know by name have a pretty strong resume to back them up and do a great job onscreen. The New Orleans/Louisiana swamp locales are a neat, new setting, and yes, there are some boobs here and there too. I wouldn't exactly call it nudity for nudity's sake. Considering the Mari Gras setting, that's just part of it. Getting to see that much more of Mercedes McNabb of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"" fame is a bonus. However, if you're thinking of picking this up just for things like that, there's not that much of it and it's just some ""Girls Gone Wild"" spoof style flashing, nothing more. The real stars of this film though, were the gory and creative death scenes. Now, while I'm a big horror fan, I'm not much of a gorehound, and though some may feel these scenes weren't real looking enough, they were real enough to make me squeamish. If the thought of heads being twisted off or a girl being defaced with a belt sander appeals to you, you'll dig this. And props to the filmmakers for not using any CGI in this picture!

So, why do I feel this movie isn't quite as dazzling as some of the hype might lead you to believe? Well, for one, like so many recent horror films of this nature, the ending doesn't really feel like an ending. I realize they are coming out with a sequel, but jeez, these sudden stops in horror films these days just aren't satisfying. On top of that, I never really heard any explanation as to why Victor Crowley was back from the dead. I guess this is a tribute to the lack of explanation we got for Jason's immortality in the Friday the 13th series, but I didn't like it then either. Also, there really wasn't anything special about this story to set it apart from other slasher films and make it really stand out. It might be slightly better than others thanks to the humorous lead-in and the cast, and the creative new deaths, but there wasn't anything strikingly special in the very basic plot or anything like that. On a lesser complaint, the comedy, which is skillfully kept separate from the horror/violence, is rather hit and miss. I would also have to say that the bickering between McNabb's and Joleigh Fioreavanti's ditzy actress characters, which was supposed to be comic relief, came off as too annoying for my tastes.

The Unrated Director's Cut DVD of ""Hatchet"" looks great and is loaded with extras, making it a very worthwhile purchase if you are a fan or just curious and free with your spending. As I said, it's an enjoyable film for the most part and deserving of one viewing at least. I don't think most horror fans or gorehounds would regret a blind-buy. The extras include a great audio commentary with the director Adam Green, Cinematographer Will Barratt, and the three lead stars (Joel David Moore, Tamara Feldman, and Deon Richmond), an excellent making of featurette, an in-depth look at one of the most interesting death scenes, two other behind-the-scenes featurettes (all the featurette stuff includes great interview and behind-the-scenes footage), a gag reel, trailer, and touching story of how Twisted Sister made this movie happen.",1200182400,,4475,4.633501259445844
3299469,2,B0011FLM00,"I'm a fan of slasher horror films. I've loved them since I was a kid, and I carry that love into adulthood. This is a genre with few true gems but a great deal of fun, popcorn fare.

First of all, let me offer some props to the director for avoiding the more modern torture horror and trying to get back to some more traditional (dare I use that word in relation to this type of movie???) horror themes. You have just about everything here: An awesome soundtrack, gratuitous nudity that adds nothing to the story, a misunderstood mutant seeking some sort of vengeance or turf protection, a group of wise-cracking, oblivious fun seekers destined for demise, the crazy old hermit coot (played excellently by John Carl Buechler) who tries to warn the know-it-all youngsters (and, in this case, some middle-aged tourists as well), the cautious local who knows the truth, blood and gore and over-the-top violence, and a bumbling but sweet hero. If the movie also had gratuitous teenage sex scenes played alongside the gore and horror, it would be following the recipe for a slasher film.

However, I kept wanting a bit more from this story. It's one thing to pay homage to the greats, but an entirely different thing to take it further and create something unique. That doesn't happen here. Green names his anti-hero mutant after the infamous Aleister Crowley, which might be more befitting of an actual monster rather than the sympathetic character he seemed to want to create. Not one of the characters seems to be really surprised or scared that they are in the middle of a blood fest; Marcus is perhaps the only character who understands that the entire situation is crazy, but he is played with bug-eyed terror for pure comic effect. I cringed in embarrassment for Mercedes McNab; I imagine she owed someone a favor or hasn't had much luck getting more decent character actress roles (as die-hard Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans, both my husband and I were dumbfounded to see Harmony jiggling her goodies for a few cheap scenes).

Green says in the 40-minute ""Making of..."" feature that an 8-year-old thought of this story. That is endearing, but I would hope that the story could be a little more honed 20+ years down the line.

Surprisingly where this DVD shines is in the extra features. I typically either don't watch the extras or skim through them once. However, the commentary with Adam Green, Will Barrett, and a few members of the cast as well as the ""Making of"" feature and ""A Twisted Tale"" really show that Green has a true passion for this genre. Getting this film from the page to the screen truly was a labor of love. The extra features changed my ho-hum attitude toward the film to something with much more interest and appreciation.

Oh, and about those special features? You might want to skip the short Gag Reel. ""Gag"" here is not a euphamism for funny or for blooper. Gag means gag.

Another thing that came out of the Commentary is that there were many scenes that were cut for the theatrical release of Hatchet. I'm astounded because, first of all, there is nothing in there that is any less horrifying than in Saw or Hostel, etc. Secondly, without the gorier scenes, I can't imagine that this movie makes much sense. It would just be a bunch of young people running through a swamp being chased by a crazy mutant.

Highlight of the film: The music playing while the group heads out for the doomed swamp tour is some of the most inspired and funniest music I've heard in a horror film in a long while. In fact, I really liked the music throughout the film, and Marilyn Manson is featured in the credits with a song that's perfect for the slasher genre. Another highlight? I had some true laugh-out-loud moments while watching this. And one more highlight for good measure: The special effects for this low budget flick are actually pretty good. I think Green did a great job of finding people who are good at what they do and respecting them enough to let them do it.

So, if you and some friends are looking for a slasher rental, this isn't such a bad DVD to pick up. But don't watch it expecting true horror or even a throwback to the early Nightmare, Friday the 13th, or Halloween days. As a comedy this is a decent little rental. As horror? It leaves its audience wanting something meatier.",1200182400,6,4313,4.628758169934641

So naturally it reminded me of being a kid again.
And as a result...I loved it.

Remember when horror was fun??
When curvey chics unabashedly flashed the camera like every other scene.
Remember loving the bad guy??
When each death scene was something you looked foward to.
When each death scene was a gorey vision to behold
Well this flick has got it all,
Bad jokes, Lovable/Hatable characters, Fake [...], & Vicious death scenes,
I mean really freakin' vicious death scenes.
(I love when that guy gets cut from shoulder to waist)
(And who could forget the instant classic; belt sander to the face)

What's even better is that this flick never once takes itself seriously.
It knows who its influences are. (He!! they're in the movie)
It knows the tongue in cheek joke they've all become.
And it runs with that joke.
What's wrong with having a good time every so often??
I don't want my every slasher flick to be serious.
(But when they are, I want them to be ""Murder Set Pieces: DC"" serious)
I wanna laugh and cheer sometimes.
I want my main-character to be the villian,
And I wanna watch with glee as the buffons get slaughtered.

Most of the American versions are not that great, compared to the original Japanese versions.  Not to mention that those aren't to great easy since they all same to be the same movie.  The Grudge, The Ring (Ringu), One missed call, Reincarnation and the eye are all very similar.  The Eye was kind of scary, but the ending was very disappointing.  I don't know, but little kids and a girl with long hair is not scary to me and thats when I need to see gore.  Hostel I is one of the best gory movies in a while, but the story was kind of slow.

3299474,2,B0011FLM00,"I LOVE cheesy bad horror movies, but HATE horror movies trying to be bad.  This ends up being just plain bad, in a bad way.

I am being generous with two stars and this is due to the behind the scenes feature included. This segment was head over heels (literally) better than the movie itself.  There was a passion in the filmmakers, and a clear camaraderie with the cast, but it just never hits the intended mark.

The only notable cast are the veteran character actors Richard Riehle and Patrika Darbo, but they should leave this off their resume.  And Joel Moore is treated to his first lead role.

First of all, it's easier to think of the cast as a mix of Gilligan's Island and Lost... seriously.  You have Gilligan (mixed with a little Shaggy from Scooby Doo) and Skipper (token black guy) partying in New Orleans, but Gilligan just broke up with his girlfriend, and would prefer to leave the T&A (not much to speak of) and go on a three hour swamp tour.  Of course!

We meet the flip-side of Jin Kwon (who is the token Asian with a really bad dialect) and he will be our tour guide.  Then the Professor (porn producer), Ginger (porn actress), MaryAnn (porn actress), Mr. and Mrs. Howell, and then which might as well be Kate Austen.

The Director pulled strings to get cameos by the actors that played real Freddie, Candyman, Jason and a Blair Witch victim.  Don't blink.

Of course the tour guide crashes the boat, and they are stuck on the swampland.  Jason in an Elephant Man suit attacks everyone.  No suspense.  No scariness.  No plot.  Plenty of poor gore.

The scariest thing about this movie is that they are working on Hatchet 2.",1200009600,3,1645,4.496621621621622

3299479,2,B0011FLM00,"This ""homage"" to the eighties ""slasher"" flick tries hard but falls a little flat for several reasons. Firstly this is 2007, not 1980 and what would have been huge back then (this film has no shortage of both gore and inventive murder scenes) is just not that exciting. Secondly, a cast of veritable ""nobodies"" which would have not mattered back then, (and arguably was essential) doesn't bring any extra style to the picture, which is predictable and almost laughable in places. Thirdly, today's moviegoer could be considered spoiled with high def special effects, celebrity cameos getting killed in a grisly fashion, and generally more polished feel to even low budget horror flicks, but when the bar is set at that level, you must be at least in the same area.
It seems that today's generation of fans of this type of movie (think the Saw franchise for example) want a little more intellectual stimulation than just in your face gore.
This isn't complete bilge (as the two stars denote) and has some extremely nasty on screen moments, or few jumps and (as I assume) was intended leads the viewer down a familiar path with the victims, and delivers accordingly.
However, even if the genre remains loosely the same today as 25 odd years ago, at least there are usually a few more twists and turns in a modern horror, or some genuine suspense through creative scripting, and good casting. Hatchet unfortunately lacks both.",1199923200,3,1421,4.851851851851852

3299482,3,B0011FLM00,"There's nothing in ""Hatchet"" that you haven't seen before.  Instead of spam in a cabin, the meat in this movie is spam on a boat and then in a swamp.  At least we get a better idea of the characters in this movie before they get killed than in much of the genre.

However, director Adam Green does two things that really set ""Hatchet"" apart, and that more new filmmakers should do.  First, Green hired experienced actors who know what they're doing, and gets out of their way.  You won't recognize any of the names on the DVD box, but you'll recognize most of the actors as ""hey, it's that guy!"" once you start watching.  A simple search on IMDB shows that most of the actors have worked a lot prior to this movie.  Their professionalism shows, and really goes a long way toward making this a decent movie.  Second, Green didn't go over the magic 90 minute mark.  In most genres, for most stories, once the movie breaks 90 minutes it becomes a tedious mess.  ""Hatchet"" weighs in at an economical 84 minutes, as I recall - not long enough to wear out its welcome or get bogged down in useless subplots.

On the downside, the monster is more sympathetic than monster-y.  Green talks about how he wanted to create a monster you'd root for.  But I didn't really root for him in the sense of wanting him to rack up a body count; the victims didn't do anything to deserve to die.  As my wife said, you root for him as a person, but the monster ultimately just makes you kind of sad.

Copious extras will appeal to anyone who's interested in how low-budget movies get made by starting directors.  ""Hatchet"" is worth at least a rent by horror and low-budget movie fans.",1199664000,,1661,4.39672131147541

3299484,3,B0011FLM00,"If you have a hankering for a healthy portion of gore, guts and grotesqueness sprinkled with a smattering of gratuitous frontal nudity, your quest is over. Hatchet is certain to satiate the appetite.  The only purpose of this movie is to display the slicing and dicing of a gaggle of characters with an array of devices and it admirably succeeds in meeting the objective, however my attention span is not that short.

I prefer psychological horror and my leisure time is both limited and precious so this subset of the horror genre falls on the periphery of my interests yet for those who gravitate in that direction, it is not difficult to see how it could service as 90 minutes of fun.

What you have is a specious reason for a bunch of people to travel to a locale where they might serve as sacrificial lambs to the movie's malevolent force, the hideously deformed but tragically sympathetic Victor Crowley. In consideration of the hackneyed dialogue and distractingly over the top performances, I wanted all of the characters bludgeoned and the sooner the better. While it was clear certain scenes and exchanges were intended as humorous interludes, in the main I found them lacking. If it was intended as a parody of the most noticeable offerings of the category like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Friday the Thirteenth, I think it may have been an over-ambitious effort.

For me, the character of Marcus encapsulated my feelings when he railed against paying for the swamp tour he was about to take in the effort to support his buddy:  ""No, I'm just not paying for this bull....""",1199491200,,1594,4.802919708029197

It's not even ""Saturday the 14th.""

Second: the makers would also have you believe that this is an homage to the grand old horror franchises. It's not that either. Though it does feature some of the actors (mostly in cameos).

This is a low-to-mid-budget, poorly scripted, mostly poorly acted gore film with pretensions. How Patrika Darbo & Mercedes McNab got talked into this, I will never know. Maybe their house needed a new waterheater or something.

It most closely resembles the films made by slasher fans turned film students. The effects are all fine for what they are: ""gee-golly look what we can do!"" They don't look realistic, just (in places) spectacular. There is one good startle moment and a couple good jokes.

This would be good for you if nothing I have said has turned you off or if you've seen every slasher movie & just need something else (notice I didn't say ""new"" or ""fresh"").

3299486,3,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is meat and potatos horror. It's story is basic, it's approach is basic, and the overall feel and tone of the movie is classic 80's slasher. For what the movie is trying to be, and the audience it is trying to satisfy, it delivers and succeeds. Adam Green has written and directed a movie that is straight forward 1980's horror and doesn't apologize for what it is. If this is your thing, then you should be more than satisfied. Background story for our killer?. Check. gratuitous nudity?. Check. Nice body count?. Check. All the stand bys are there. The movie doesn't necessarily rise above any of the cliches or tries to be ""Scream"", but it embraces them and just tries to have old fashioned fun. The story?. A bunch of people in New Orleans go on a haunted boat tour in the swamp. This particular swamp is home to Victor Crowley(Kane Hodder, from Friday The 13th fame), a deformed being who gets anyone who comes near his old home. Simple enough. Our unlucky passengers get stranded in the swamp and learn that the Victor Crowley legend is no story...he's real and he's out to get them. Like I said earlier, real basic, but then it's supposed to be. Victor's intended victims are a hodepodge of characters we have seen make up a killer's death list in countless other horror films. Even tho none of these characters are new, each one has their own personality, individuality, and most of the actors are pretty good in their parts. The characters are cliched, for sure, but you just may find yourself liking most of them, and actually wanting them to make it out alive. When was the last time a slasher movie did that?. The most familiar of the bunch is probably Mercedes McNab, best known for her role as Harmony on both ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel"". She is basically doing a variation of that dim bulb character here, but she does dumb blonde well. As for Victor Crowley himself, he is a big, nasty looking monster, and he basically just does what he does. Not much else going on there. And since this is a loving tribute to a certain time and type of horror movie, it is not surprising to see some familiar faces here. Freddy Krueger himself, Robert Englund, appears in the opening minutes, and Tony""Candyman"" Todd has a funny little cameo in town. The movie is also pretty funny, and most of the humor is spot on and funny. But what about the gore?. The gore and mayhem is out of this world. If that's what you love, then you won't be disappointed. It's over the top, and in your face. The special effects, gore, and death scenes/make-up are really well done. The movie is not short on the red stuff. In the end, Hatchet is not the second coming of horror like so many other places have said, nor is Victor Crowley the next heavyweight icon of horror, but the movie IS a well made hack-a-thon that's fun and entertaining. The gore and blood factor is high, the death scenes are something else, the humor is welcomed, and you have characters that you just might not want to see just be fodder for Mr. Crowley.

In this movie I was able to displace all of my woes onto poor Victor Crowley, the deformed child who was teased, burned, and accidentally chopped in the head with his daddy's hatchet.

Clearly Victor Crowley is a metaphor for all of us who at one time or another have been mocked and ridiculed and had our swamp cabin invaded by outsiders.  Sure society and the Bible tells us that we should merely turn the other cheek but with Victor as a role model it's clear that sometimes it may be just to simply grab an intruder and twist their head around 360 degrees...so in a sense they turn the other cheek (ha).  I shed several tears for Victor Crowley who clearly just needed a hug but instead got people urinating on his property, stealing his tools, and vandalizing his neighboring graveyard.

3299505,4,B0011FLM00,"Hatchet is one of those films that comes along and either makes an impact or leaves people high and dry. Amongst its film festival circuit, it was well received. It got a very short, very limited theatrical run. Finally, 2 years after its birth, Hatchet hit DVD, and the story of Victor Crowley is here for everyone.

 Hatchet is the small story about Victor Crowley, a disfigured young man who was supposedly accidentally killed by his dad as a child, and returns to his shed and woods whenever anyone has the audacity to pass through his woods. A group of tourists happen upon his woods, and Crowley takes care of them.

 This seems like a simple plot that didn't need much brains to come up with it, right? Well, right, but that's what makes this movie such a little gem to me. It has been called a throwback to the eighties, and that it was. The horros of the eighties never had much of a storyline. They just gave its killer a small motive, threw in a bunch of teens, gore, and nudity, and off went the movie. This is how Hatchet was done. What makes it set from the rest is that it was obvious that the director, cast, and crew behind this film are fans of the genre. They attempted to give the hardcore horror fan viewer everything they could want, and succeeded.

 There are truly insane kills. Two of our ladies constantly give boob shots. Our characters are one-dimensional, stereo-types ... but the kind that we begin to sort of like based on the personalities given. We are set in the labyrinth woods of New Orleans where it's dark and wet and nasty. And we are given one of the better recent horror maniacs to date. That is Victor Crowley who is portrayed by none other than Jason 7-X himself, Kane Hodder.

 I originally wanted to see this film for Mercedes McNab. I must confess that I am a fan of hers thanks to her character of Harmony on Buffy & Angel. Then the horror movie sites that I visit constantly began to praise and adore this film. More reviews kept popping up on the net so whenever I was able, I was going to check this film out. Living on the SC/NC stateline, a theater never played Hatchet during its small run. I had to wait until the DVD came out to see it. I was there the first day it was out, and purchased it, and watched it that night. I loved it. I loved Mercedes McNab. And I loved Hatchet.

 It wasn't until I watched the special features on the disc that I grew a major appreciation for Hatchet. There are 5 featurettes.

 The first is a Making Of. This isn't some silly little 10 minutes ""making of"" that we see on a lot of DVDs these days. This is almost an hour's worth of start to finish production diaries along with cast & crew interviews and neat little background stories on the film.

 ""Meeting Victor Crowley"" is an introduction to Kane Hodder and the maniac he portrays in Hatchet. My favorite part of the bonuses is in here as Kane - dressed as Victor - plays a practical joke on an unsuspecting Mercedes McNab.

 ""Guts & Gore"" is just a small little diddy on the plethora of guts and gore effects that went on. I am proud to say that the people behind Hatcher are very proud to say that they did not use one ounce of CG on the effects they created. And the effects look awesome.

 ""Anatomy of a Kill"" details one of the film's most ridicolous kills from concept to film. A neat addition is viewing the scene from three different point of views: before cut, after cut, with actual actor, and with prop.

 ""A Twisted Tale"" is about director, Adam Green's, love for Twisted Sister.

 There's also a Gag Reel that isn't much, and the audio commentary which I have yet to get to but should be completely worth it.

 Hatchet is truly a dedication to the genre thanks to Adam Green and his creation of the Victor Crowley story. Many times during the featurettes he gives little insight on what a sequel would be like, and I hope that he gets to make that sequel. Hollywood needs more like Adam Green.",1198800000,3,3949,4.356070941336971

leading man. And what about ""The Sorpranos"" like ending?
Good...bad? I'm still not sure....

Anyway, I got the exclusive 2-Disc edition. All it really
has is the unrated disc and the R-rated one in one keepcase with a leaf, so if you bought either version of the movie, your disc is in it. And what's the difference between the cuts? 31 seconds. Seriously...but that half minute does make a heck of a difference.

To an old-school fan of Friday The 13th, Halloween, and countless other slasher films of the 80's, this brought back great memories and earns to be beside them in my collection. After the recent tragedy of Halloween '07, this gave my hope of modern-day Horror a little more much needed boost.",1198195200,2,1908,4.553935860058309
3299531,5,B0011FLM00,This is by far a must own dvd! One of the greatest slasher flicks since Friday The 13th . If you don't like this your either 8 or just plain don't like horror films . Mr. Crowley's waiting now get this dvd! Oh yeah..Gore pushed to the MAX!,1198108800,,239,4.0
3299532,5,B0011FLM00,"I just finished watching Hatchet and I loved it. The best Indi-horror film I've seen in a while. I was thrilled, shocked and I did laugh several times. Try it out,,,
Lots of  atmosphere and lots of T and gore, but all in fun! Yes ,it's reto-style but it's fresh.
DVD quality is beyond great, picture dark ,vivid; Sound is outstanding, with a splashy surround design and an aggressive Bass.
I did have fun, I was entertained and I liked it.",1198022400,,439,4.419753086419753
3299533,3,B0011FLM00,"This movie is fine for what it is. Leave it alone. Venom was better because it was coming from a more serious angle but if you want some good gory special effects then this movie is the one. Sometimes you feel for chicken sometimes for steak. Get over it. The movie is fine for what it is. Not expecting ""The Pianist"" here.",1197936000,,323,4.225806451612903
3299534,5,B0011FLM00,"This movie I had to watch twice to appreciate fully.  The first time, it was this monster chasing people around a swamp.  The second time, its beauty stood out.  I don't want to ruin any surprises that this may hold, but any movie you put Robert Englund and Kane Hodder in, you're bound to have a classic.  I only wish that Robert Englund had a larger part.  Also, Kane Hodder was severely burned over a majority of his body, so I find it funny that his character ""died"" in a fire.  It was great!  The unrated cut also has more of the blood that us true horror fans live for!  Don't expect this to be the best horror/slasher movie ever, but have fun.  Horror movies are for fun, this one is just that.",1197504000,4,701,4.2105263157894735
3299535,1,B0011FLM00,"I can only assume the people who gave this movie 5 stars have a financial stake in this video being sold. Nothing else can explain the glowing reviews.

When I think of Old School American Horror three movies instantly come to mind -- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Dawn of the Dead (1978), and Halloween (1978). This movie did not have the feel of any of these films. Those 3 films are all either very creepy or very disturbing and at times both.

Now I don't know if I should really compare Hatchet to these three films, but when you advertise your film as Old School American Horror, these are the comparisons that are going to get made. The main difference in Hatchet over these films is that I never really felt the menace from the Victor Crowley character that I felt from the characters in those films. Mike Meyers and Leatherface are scary and disturbed characters that are very unsettling to watch on film as are the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. Victor Crowly, though, did not ever feel menacing to me.",1193443200,8,1016,4.516304347826087
3299536,5,B0011FLM00,"saw this at the drive-in in indiana on sept 29, it was part of a whole night with kane hodder, they played 3 movies and he signed autographs,,,, this movie has plenty of everything that makes a good horror movie, girls, idiots, blood, man eating alligators, blood, flying limbs, blood, people chopped in half, tourist, an asian kid, tony todd cameo, robert englund cameo, blood, a disfigured kid getting a hatchet to the face, the movie also has a lot of fun with itself, a better variety of characters than most horror movies made now....you have an older couple, a fat guy who is a movie guy sort of, two females, another female, 2 college guys,,,,,,,blood....very entertaining",1193011200,4,679,4.811965811965812
3299537,2,B0011FLM00,"No one from my Amazon circle of friends was anticipating this more
than me.  After first seeing the trailer which is still awesome
I really thought I was getting a very good HORROR film. In no way
did I go into this thinking I was getting the next EXORCIST,T.C.M.
JAWS,HALLOWEEN,SUSPIRIA,ALIEN or even PHANTASM for that matter.
I was hoping this was going to be at least a CRAVEN'S HILLS
HAVE EYES or a PROWLER...HELL I would have taken a ANTHROPOPHAGUS
ripoff!  No! You want to know what this is! CRAPPOHLA!!!!!!!
The first scene of Robert(ROBBIE! You Rule)Englund and a friend
in the Bayou was GREAT! Now we get the EERIE titles to HAUNTING
music you ask...No! Manson music???  O.K. I'm still hanging in there
we now are in N.O. Louisiana and the main star does not want to
spend his time watching girls GO WILD! He wants to take this HORROR
tour on a boat fair enough except that the guy with the black hat
giving the tour was so irritating that I wanted to take a HATCHET
to my own head. On the HORROR tour boat there are other tourist
with the personality of a dried up ......!  The tourist finally
come up to the Crowley house where all the sudden OUT COMES VICTOR??
It was like WHAT WAS THAT!  Here I am! No suspense No nothing!
So Victor hacks up a man in half(very cool I might add,though very
fake as well)and rips the mouth open of the Hacked-mans wife(very
C.G.I. I might add) The rest of the group leave in sec. and understandably so. However when they have calmed down is when this movie
really COMES DOWN for we get a lot of stupid humor for the next 45 min
and it really is STUPID! This movie fails at both ends for it is awful
at HORROR and REALLY bad at comedy.  I do not mind comedy in HORROR
if you watch real hard you will see that all the HORROR films you love
will have it in there and was that purposely put it there can be great
like RE-ANIMATOR-CEMETARY MAN-DEAD ALIVE-EVIL DEAD and RETURN of the
DEAD are GREAT!!! HATCHET for me was not!  I really was hoping it was Old
School HORROR...What I got was The Same O HORROR for 2000 and up.
This and ONE MISSED CALL are hand to hand HORROR!!!!!!!!
2 stars are for Tony(CANDY MAN)Todd Robert(N.O.E.S.84)Englund
a COUPLE of good kills and the trailer which still rocks!
BUT THIS???  TIS POO-POO!",1192320000,,2265,4.363420427553444
8241649,4,B0011FLM00,This movie is great!!  Amazing practical effects!  Highly recommended to horror fans sick of computer generated gore!  And the RAGE of Hatchet Face is expressed explicitly through each and every overkill he commits.  Intense!,1527120000,,225,5.529411764705882
