8663297,5,B00L1WJF1G,"This was a continuation of the season two episodes I earlier reviewed. Even though I watched this series for the first time in season two I quickly was able to catch on and get into the action. I for one, had a blast watching this. I enjoyed the action (of course) but also the animation was strong and the characters are memorable. I was surprised to as little people that knew of this series, but alas, that is their loss and now I have been encouraging more and more to watch this as it is a ton of fun. These five episodes continue to adventure and you truly get pulled into the action. I enjoyed these episodes and the overall series and think you will too!
