6710535,5,B00O4HG28Y,What a beautiful testament  to show the beauty of our senior women. Not only are they gorgeous in beautifully chosen fashion  clothing  but also have  beautiful attitudes and charisma. I would recomend this movie to every senior woman to give her confidence in herself but also to teenage girls who  cannot accept any lack of perfection in themselves. This is a movie for all ages. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to watch it many more times,1414540800,21,442,4.688311688311688

6710541,5,B00O4HG28Y,"While not another Runway of Bulimic Beauty, this is a beautiful movie about fancy older (pardon, elderly) women.  Think YOU will not grow OLD?
As often quoted, think of the alternative.  I inherited a pile of money from a couple of elderly aunts, so I admit I am prejudiced to the limits.  My bank and credit limits, that is.  What limits?  Withdrawals and online purchases...  Please, ladies, keep looking great.  Inspirational movie, this is, might have said Yoda.  I temporarily forget the proper name for Gigolo, but that has to occur to the viewer.  Boy Toy?  Please do not accuse the director and narrator of these terms.  This is good clean fun.  I know all my junk will end up in a thrift shop or Goodwill store.  But this film is High Class.",1483228800,3,750,4.548872180451128

6710548,5,B00O4HG28Y,"Apparently New York is full of older women (late 60s to mid-90s) who are the complete antithesis of the traditional view that crones should wear black and be quiet. These ladies, discovered by Ari Seth Cohen, who wrote first a blog and then a book about them, are lovingly portrayed in this documentary, directed by Lina Plioplyte. Some are truly elegant, some just happily Over the Topbut every one exudes vigor, self-confidence, and love of life. Almost all wear outfits as brightly colored as a cageful of macaws, full of gleefully clashing patterns and big chunky jewelry; several say that they are artists and they are their own art works.

Some of the women, like Iris Apfel (subject of her own excellent documentary, Iris), are well known in the high-fashion world, others not. Whats most important, I think, is not the clothes (fun though they are) but the confidence with which the women wear them: they know exactly who they are, and they're not the least bit shy about proclaiming that identity to the world. They are fabulous role models for women of any age, but most especially for those of us who are older. I hope that someday Cohen and Plioplyte will go to other cities and look for equally colorful women there. If they ever get to the San Francisco area, Ill put on my favorite dress and homemade jewelry and go wave at them!",1458604800,,1344,4.670886075949367

6710560,4,B00O4HG28Y,"As a writer of fashion fiction I was drawn to this. This is a true story about a group of amazing inspirational woman of a certain age who all have their own love of clothing and all that goes with it. In the UK we might describe some of them as a little eccentric. You have to admire their energy, creativity and zest for life, getting up everyday and having the motivation to dress and present themselves in their own inimitable way. But in terms of style, I cannot say I felt they did have great or advanced style with the exception perhaps of Joyce Carpati and Jacquie Murdock. Style somehow seems totally the wrong word, because what they all have in spades is a love of colour, art, textiles, jewelry, makeup, accessories and their own form of glamour. To me, the way the majority of these ladies dressed was much more a form of 'art expression' that had nothing necessarily to do with our traditional image of style. They certainly are all very individual, never dull and certainly not at all slaves to the mass market dictates of the fashion world. Wonderful. You could see these woman as muses to top couturiers, because they bring with them great knowledge of fashion, quality and dressing from the past. Yet they are pushing the boundaries by also showing us a new future, that the art of dressing and fashion can be enjoyed by everyone, and that it's not only something people under 30 with younger skin, hair and figures can enjoy. Fashion magazines and designers take note.",1444003200,,1487,4.593984962406015

6710575,4,B00O4HG28Y,"If you've seen the wonderful book, with page after page of extraordinary, stylish women, the documentary is a bit on the thin side. Obviously some of the great looking women in the book didn't want to be filmed, or weren't asked, which is a pity, because the film would have had more depth if most of the women in it weren't quite so eccentric. It's charming, and ultimately very touching, but when some of the women on the page, leap onto the screen, a touch of the fairy dust disappears. My guess would be that individually, many of them thought this up close and personal approach might burst the fragile bubble. But whatever you think of them individually - as a group, they all get ten out of ten. It could easily have been a good twenty minutes or more longer, and even more interesting if there were more women featured with the variable taste that made the book such fun.",1429488000,3,879,4.46583850931677

She wore a black leather jacket with 12""fringe, and had a full length leopard print coat,  she also wore, until her death at 89. She always put on make up, as do I. I guess it's something I must do to be me. I find I don't want to look like everyone else, and this DVD, brought back some really good memories.

These women, ages 65 to in their 90's show us that dressing up and going out on the street, even if only to the grocery store, is a therapeutic and lively event. They look gorgeous and inspire women wherever they live to get up every morning, put on their face and dress with style, their own style. Marvelous!!!!",1420675200,6,490,4.336956521739131

6710592,5,B00O4HG28Y,"I first became aware of this little jewel of a movie after a friend of mine posted it on face book.  My fascination with these ""dressed to the ninth"" ladies was immediate and total and I ordered the movie.  As I watched these bold ladies and their attitudes on aging, their beautiful put together outfits and love of life, a shot of inspiration cursed throughout my body and I swore right then and there that I myself would make a change in my every day life to dress and think more creatively and more colorful.  This adorable movie changed my life.  First thing I did was buy myself a hot pink cashmere sweater and made a hot pink headband with an outrageously huge pink flower pinned on it.  I never got this much attention and compliments since my 20's and I loved it.  If you are young or old I would highly recommend you buy this ""feel good movie"" because it will give you hope and joy.  My compliments to acclaimed street style photographer Ari Seth Cohen and director Lina Plioplyte for their imagination and insight to do this creative work.",1420329600,25,1050,4.465968586387435
6710593,5,B00O4HG28Y,"'Advanced Style' is a lovely and at times amusing documentary. The film maker, also a blogger, Ari Seth Cohen, and while working through the streets of New York City he saw many lovely older women who reminded him of his grandmother. He would stop and introduce himself and tell the person he loved their style, would like to take a photo. These people, all women in this film, were flattered and acceded to his request. He started to develop relationships with these women, appearing in his blog. They run the gamut of every possible style, shape and age. From late 50's to 95, we get to meet these women in all their glory.

""Seven New York women are profiled in this film. We meet, Tziporah Salamon, known as Zippy, is the baby of the group, at 62 (during the filming). She shows off her vintage ensembles while bicycling around Manhattan. Zelda Kaplan, 95, is the eldest, a connoisseur of woven fabrics whose last visit to Fashion Week is the films most dramatic development. Joyce Carpati, 80, seems the most elegant, with a silver Frances Farmer braid, pearls and an antiques-filled apartment."" New York Times.

 My favorite woman is Joyce Carpati, such a beautiful woman with a glorious braid and superb skin. She is fashionable and more reserved most of the time, than the other women. However, all of the women are just glorious. I enjoyed all of their stories and their fashion. The pink hair, bold lips, long red eyelashes made out of the woman's hair, array of colors, hats, hair styles, all add to the charm of these women. They give their vision and represent themselves so well.

The blogger, Ari Cohen, has done such a great service to the older woman in New York City. Their lives have changed and so has his life, for the better. We follow these women in their daily lives, then to California to a television show. Two women are picked to do a campaign for a beauty product. They all appear at a fashion show, where Zelda Kaplan, the 95 year old has a medical emergency. You can read Ari Cohen's blog and see his photos and catch up on the news of the women.

6710594,5,B00O4HG28Y,"Absolutely love it. I saw some reviews saying that it was not what they expected and it showed only crazy old women dressed like bag ladies or clowns. Yes, there are some with really unique eccentric outlandish taste (even by young people standards) but there are many who are elegant and stylish. The whole point is to show older women don't have to conform to tradition and can choose to be themselves and do what feel good for them. I live in an eclectic place called Asheville and it's so much fun people watching. People need to be more broad-minded and more accepting of our differences. You don't read this book to imitate others' ways. You read this book to be inspired and know you can wear whatever you feel like regardless of your age.
