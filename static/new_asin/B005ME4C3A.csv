4834737,5,B005ME4C3A,"Optimal Nutrition for Best Human Health - ""Ess"" Nails it!

For over the past twenty-five years, Dr. Esselstyn has been successfully guiding heart patients back to life via optimal nutrition, after they were sent home to die!  You probably have read his excellent 2007 book of the same title? Surely you saw the recent CNN Special by Dr. Sanjay Gupta: ""The Last Heart Attack,"" featuring Dr. Esselstyn and President Bill Clinton???  That 80 minute show is still available on the CNN website.

Oh - let's not forget Ess's co-staring role, with Dr. T. Colin Campbell, in the recent powerful, life-changing movie, available as a DVD on Amazon, ""Forks Over Knives (Scalpel)""

In this professionally produced video (distribution assisted by Jeff Nelson, Founder of VegSource.com), Dr. Esselstyn and his wife, Ann, give us the four-hour presentation of their Cleveland Clinic Seminar:

Ch. 1 - History of Blood Vessel Disease

Ch. 2 - Proof of Concept:  Clinical Proof of Arrest & Reversal

Ch. 3 - Eating Plant-Perfect: What to eat, buy, & how to cook

Ch. 4 - Seismic Revolution in Health: Controlling Your Outcome!

This is fast-paced, entertaining and at the level needed to persuade you to eat this way forever!  As Dr. Dean Ornish says, this will be more sustainable because you are changing your motivation from ""Fear of Dying"" to ""Joy of Living!""

I think that the live seminar at the Ohio Cleveland Clinic costs ~ $1,200 (?). For about $60, delivered, this DVD Seminar works even better and you can refresh the material over and over and share viewing with your family, friends, etc.

You can get great evaluation and application information from the ""Healthy Librarian"" Blog (Google that).  It turns out that this education lady is on the medical library staff at the Cleveland Clinic!  She participated in the seminar and writes a summary of it and, since then, her progress and results --  all excellent!

I mention this, below, so that you know that I feel very qualified to evaluate this DVD:

 -- My family of four has been on plant-based, whole-foods nutrition for the last nine years, after participating in Dr. John McDougall's 10-day ""Total Health Solution Clinic.""  drmcdougall.com) We know that it works as promoted!

 -- My extensive health education material is available on-line (do a Google Search).  This is more than about food!  Try to avoid the medical/health/drugs/supplements/government guidance ""businesses"" by taking charge of you health!!

 -- I have been conducting free grassroots ""Healthy Lifestyle Education, Application, and Support 3-month/6-session Programs"" for the last four years for people in this California Central Coast area.  A retired family physician has been supporting the meetings and he gives pamphlets and loans books and DVDs to ~20 local medical people and the hospital!  Program participants have quickly ""cured"" their diabetes and high blood pressure, and reduced/eliminated many medicines!  Watch some of our meeting videos at two of the websites, above.

I'll show clips of this new video at our ""Society of Vegetarian-inclined People"" (SoVIP) meeting on Nov. 3.  This is now the best video to focus on --  what we are treating is the blood circulation system's health and that means we can expect improvements in most of the maladies that we have!!

For myself  -- I'll increase the ""greens"" even more in my foods!  Ann motivates us and shows us how!

Get the video!  Give it as a life-enhancing gift to your loved-ones!!

4834744,5,B005ME4C3A,"Clear and to the point, this book gives indisputable guidelines why you should let food be your medicine. This is not a guide for temporary dietary changes but will a life long blueprint of what to let pass through my lips. I have had encounters with cancer and high blood pressure and know absolutely that nutrition should have been included in past treatments. A must read for all physicians!!!",1401667200,2,396,4.753623188405797
4834745,5,B005ME4C3A,"Dr. Esselstyn has been a remarkable leader throughout his life and continues to pave the way for excellence with this amazing proven program to prevent and even reverse major disease.

Thanks to Dr. Esselstyns powerful nutrition-based instruction included on this DVD, I was able to reverse plaque buildup of 28% in my carotid artery. I am just ecstatic to report that after two years of following Esselstyns plant perfect diet, my most recent scan shows that at the age of 64, my carotid arteries are now plaque free which reflects a 96% correlation with whats happening in my heart.

Like most people, before finding out that I had plaque buildup, I thought that I was eating a pretty healthy diet. Little did I know that many of the things that I had heard were healthy, like olive oil, were actually causing damage to my endothelial cells. Dr. Esselstyns careful research and clinical practice show that in fact most Americans who are eating the standard American diet are already developing the foundation for heart disease by age 20. In this DVD he gives clear direction on what foods the human body needs to maintain heart health and which ones actually cause harm to our blood vessels.

I loved the DVD because it is a quick study describing exactly how people develop heart disease and how they can prevent and reverse vascular damage with every meal they eat. For me, Ann Esselstyns demonstration on food preparation and favorite products is both fun and essential to successfully implementing this lifestyle change on a daily basis.

I urge you to take the opportunity to learn how you can help yourself and your family to better health by incorporating the information presented in this DVD into your daily lifestyle. The information is truly life saving for many and is essential for everyone who wants to maintain optimal health.

4834746,5,B005ME4C3A,"Written by a former Cleveland Clinic cancer surgeon who became disillusioned with the poor outcomes of his surgical practice, he turned part of it to diet centered practice.  Although other surgeons may have continued their surgical practices (the cash cow of hospitals), when they or members of their families developed heart disease, they went to see Esselstyn This book is based on a twenty year study of cardiac patients who, after surgery and traditional treatments were given the news that there was nothing else to do.  Although some died of OTHER causes, the vast majority are still alive.  Commit yourself to living this way!  Either read the book or buy the DVD.  I like the DVD because he so knowledgable and a great speaker.  You will NEVER, EVER believe that this man is 80 years old!  He won a gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1956 as a member of the rowing team.  his diet absolutely does work!  My father has heart disease.  His LDL is now 44.  He no longer needs statins.  On a vegan diet, my aunt has reversed her type 2 diabetes.  I have MS and, after having relapse after relapse for the first two years, I switched to a vegan diet, and have not had a relapse in 12 yrs.  That is almost unheard of.  Everyone who has wanted to has lost weight.  Esselstyn's son, Rip, is a firefighter and his entire firehouse is vegan.  He is the author of popular Engine Two Diet series.

4834750,5,B005ME4C3A,"The medical and food industries, along with the USDA, have long kept Americans corralled in ignorance for the last 100 years, intentionally feeding us contradicting and confusing and muddled information on nutrition and health, to protect their huge profits.  We have been led in ignorance and confusion like a herd of beef cattle waiting to be slaughtered.  In our case, waiting for the certain disabling illness and death that comes with the chronic diseases, that are a result of their ""Standard American Diet"" or (SAD).
The relation of nutrition, weight and health are not hard to understand at all.  The true beauty of it is it's simplicity.
Just remember this acronym, if you want to stay off the meds...stay OFFMD (don't eat) = ""O"" is Oils (and Fats), ""F"" is Foul ( incl. Chicken), ""F"" is Fish, ""M"" is Meat, and ""D"" is for Dairy.  This is what NOT to eat.
An wonderful acronym for what you should eat is given by Dr. Joel Fuhrman: GBOMBS = ""G"" is for Greens, ""B"" is for Beans, ""O"" is for Onions, ""M"" is for Mushrooms, ""B"" is for Berries, ""S"" is for seads.
Follow these two acronyms and you will become your healthiest weight and free of the chronic diseases that plague 80% of Americans.
Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn proves, beyond any doubt, in this book, ""Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease"", that anyone can reverse the plaques in their arteries, heal the endothelial cells that line the walls of your arteries and are our real shield against heart attacks and basically make us, as Dr. Esselstyn puts it, ""Heart Attack Proof"".
What is even greater news, is that if you already have had stents or bypass surgery, this way of eating can protect you from any further coronary problems. Which means, you can be confident that you will never suffer from another heart attack.
Dr. Esselstyn makes clear that chronic disease, or the diseases of affluence that we experience in America, is really just one disease with many faces.  Whether it is coronary disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, auto immune disease or obesity, all can be prevented or cured by using the same simple basic way of eating.
""Preventing and Reversing Heart Disease"" will change your life, whether you follow the plan or not.  You will have the knowledge and the knowledge is power within you own life.  No one has the right to hide these findings from the American people, or from the citizens of any country.  Especially so they can make billions in profits.

It's a very valuable reminder to take better care of our health.  It's not meant to be infotainment; it's meant to teach and save lives.

4834756,1,B005ME4C3A,"The book is well written but this video looks like a poor-quality informercial where the audience members all smile and nod their heads whenever something is said. It looks like it was filmed in a hotel lobby with an ancient home movie camera. The powerpoint slides aren't even made part of the video image. Instead, the camera simple pans to one of those projector screens that are supported by a tripod as from a 1960's high school. I don't mean any disrespect to Dr. Esselstyn and his wife but they seem completely unprepared for the presentation. This DVD set is worthless yet they charge $55 for it. The book is very readible and has all the content you need for this plant-based diet. Don't get these DVD's. They're a rip-off.",1343001600,30,732,4.638461538461539
