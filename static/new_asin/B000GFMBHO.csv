8131366,5,B000GFMBHO,"I'm a classical guitar enthusiast and have seen Barrueco in concert several times. This DVD is a terrific complement to his concerts and CDs. It paints a thoughtful portrait of Barrueco as a musician and as an exile from Cuba. There are nice clips from other guitarists, like Eliot Fiske, John Tannenbaum, and - my favorite - Barrueco playing a duet on his patio with one of the Assads.

Nice stuff.",1256169600,5,399,4.619718309859155
8131367,5,B000GFMBHO,"This is a marvelously-produced film about the greatest classical guitarist of the modern era. Fascinating background of his early life in Cuba and emigration to the US, with glimpses of his private life at home and with friends - several of whom, of course, are world-famous guitarists themselves. There are many scenes depicting him teaching and recording in various situations, and the amazing up-close camerawork of his performances offers guitar-lovers a rare privilege to witness the magic as never before. I was absolutely thrilled to learn about this documentary, and am indebtted to Michael Lawrence for creating a record and tribute to one of classical music's all-time virtuosos. As Odair Assad says about the evolution of the instrument: ""We can say that, at one point, it's before Manuel and after Manuel Barrueco.""",1236038400,3,827,5.2727272727272725
