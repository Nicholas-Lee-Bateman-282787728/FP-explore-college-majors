8681185,5,B00O08MKKG,"There have been comments about the picture quality of these episodes. The reason is that they are transferred from VHS tapes and have NOT been digitally restored as have other Beatles titles. The talk is that the Beatles company, Apple Corp. bought the rights and original elements of this series some years ago with the express reason that they should NEVER see the light of day! Legend has it that at the time of their production back in 1966, The Beatles and their management were so appalled by their lack of production quality, that they had them banned from being screened in London. My suggestion is that if you can get any versions of this legendary cartoon series, SNAP THEM UP!! The chances are that they will never be released by Apple, or any other video production company!",1419984000,9,786,4.702898550724638
