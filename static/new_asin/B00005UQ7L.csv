7955171,4,B00005UQ7L,"I can only rate the Mantis Fists, Tiger Claws. It has excellent fighting and the plot of it had you watching also. Alittle poor in picture quality. But overall a winner.  Duel of the Brave One is not english dubb!",1369872000,,213,4.325
7955172,4,B00005UQ7L,"Let me just say that Mantis Fists Tiger Claws is a brilliant

movie! I love how they mix slasher horror films with a typical

revenge kung fu movie! This movie took me off guard cuz I

thought this was gonna be a typical kung fu movie but after

seeing the final fight between this guy and a human praying

mantis, I was thrilled! Mantis Fists is original with a ton of

rape scenes (particulary on this one chick, poor girl) and with

some pretty good kung fu and alot of weird weapons! Oh and the movie is subtitled in French!

Duel of the Brave Ones is a typical modern day kung fu movie!

need I say more! I really don't like modern day kung fu films

cuz it just seems uninteresting to me! But this movie has nudity

so that will make you happy!

In the end: WORTH IT FOR MANTIS FISTS ALONE! It's a rare find

and well worth the $10. Stupid Mantis Fist guy you're no student

of mantis fist so you can go and die!",1113177600,3,918,4.084269662921348
7955173,1,B00005UQ7L,"Being a student of praying mantis kung fu, I HAD to buy this movie. I mean, how bad could it be? No matter what the quality, there would definitely be some good kung fu practitioners in this somewhat esoteric style, right? WRONG. The fighting is bad, sound is bad, filming is bad, quality of the DVD and its source (looks like a 10th generation video copy) is bad, the story is impossible to follow. There are two unnecessarily explicit partial-nudity rape scenes, and gratuitous gore throughout. I give it at least 1 star, because it's so bad it's hilarious at times. If you can stay awake. At the end, the horrible and super-deadly mysterious predator is revealed--someone hopping around in a furry green mantis suit with big scary mantis claws for hands. Unless you're a fan of campy, trashy kung fu and/or horror movies, don't bother. I took mine back for a refund. I can't review ""Duel of the Brave Ones"" because it was so bad I couldn't even watch it. Basically a cheesy 70's Honk Kong gangster streetfighting flick. In a genre known for its bad acting, writing, directing and filming, these 2 are the bottom of the barrel.",1022198400,,1129,4.65
7955174,5,B00005UQ7L,"First off,the quality of the ultra rare Mantis Fists and Tiger Claws is not very good. It apparently is the only existing print left of this film,so what can we do?I would complain but the price is so low,that it's well worth buying. The movie is wild to say the least. A woman gets raped by a mantis(!)and her daughter turns into a mantis kung fu monster. Need I say more?The second feature is with the same cast and has great action. Get a bag of snacks and enjoy!",1018137600,2,466,4.247191011235955
