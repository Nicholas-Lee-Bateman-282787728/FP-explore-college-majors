He was so good that he went undefeated as a black belt and retired after only about a year because there was no one that could take him. He had a deep desire to win and had no problem driving his technique into an opponent to prove it. He later became more famous as the man who broke up Elvis' marriage. This of course was not really true or fair to Stone. Stone in later years proved to be an excellent action film screewriter (Enter the Ninja and the American Ninja film series). In Tigershark Stone makes his leading man debut and fares far better than his karate rivals Joe Lewis and Chuck Norris did in their first films. Stone shows himself to be actually a capable actor who is much better than Segal or Van Damme ever were. Stone is also very good looking and is also of Polynesian-European descent. Unfortunately his career as an actor never moved on and this fil if anything is a gem for all martial artists to get a glimpse of Stone's ability which works well on film. The man was clearly dealt a bad hand in Hollywood due to his involvement with Priscilla Presley and also his matter of factness in revealing that he was less than in awe of Bruce Lee's martial arts skills than he was over Bruce's ability to sell his skills and philosophy of
 fighting to the same Hollywood moguls Stone attempted to solicit.",1425168000,,1407,4.4324324324324325
