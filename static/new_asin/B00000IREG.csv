7911632,3,B00000IREG,"The video is most definitely digital and not from VHS.  Looks great on my 55"" 1080p TV played through blu-ray player.

However, the announcer's voice is either soothing/boring/put you to sleep, depending on your taste, and they DO repeat snippets of both scenes and narration which gets annoying.

I enjoyed it because it had some unique places like Lassen Peak and Badlands, which aren't always included on travel videos.",1330819200,,422,5.086956521739131
