393258,5,6301966554,"My husband & I have watched this movie dozens of times over the years & it's definately our favorite Christmas movie.  It's hard to believe it was made in 1984 because the costumes, settings, automobiles,  everything, is so well done that your sure you're in 1940's mid-west  America.  It's simply a classic---not to be missed!",913680000,,327,4.890909090909091
393259,5,6301966554,"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out, and I knew immediately that I wanted to own it on video.  It has so many things that make it a great movie. There is the main character, Ralphie, with his  boyhood dreams of getting the ""bad guys"" with a Red Ryder BB gun;  the mom who has the right mix of zaniness and motherly compassion; and  Darren McGaven is great as the dad with all kinds of eccentricities, but in  the end comes through for Ralphie.  The family is great, and the little  vignettes are hilarious.  I especially liked how they went to a Chinese  restaurant for Christmas dinner, and the rules of how to dare a friend to  stick his tongue to a frozen flag pole. This movie has so much charm,  humor, and innocent sweetness that it has become one of our family  traditions, along with Charlie Brown, the Grinch, and George Bailey.",913680000,,856,4.348101265822785
393260,5,6301966554,"I love this movie, especia;;y whe I recognized downtown Cleveland. The whole winter wonderland makes me long for my home in Conneaut, Ohio. Thanks for making this video available.",912902400,,179,5.206896551724138
393261,5,6301966554,"This movie is right up there with A Christmas Carol.  It is on TV Guide's 10 best Christmas Movies also. And It is always on television every year a million times for one reason....people love it! So add a true christmas  classic into your household, and watch it a million times!!!",912816000,,282,4.509803921568627
393262,5,6301966554,"My favorite of my holiday video collection.  Every time I watch it I come away with having learned something new.  Great fun for the entire family, a video you'll treasure well into the next millenium.  If you haven't yet  started a Christmas video collection; start one with this!",912816000,,281,4.791666666666667
393263,5,6301966554,"Once in a great while a movie comes along that pleasantly surprises us, and this is one of them.  I first saw this movie at a friend's family's house (who always had videos playing) during the holidays, and have seen it  popping up more and more every year. It deserves the overdue recognition.  This is the kind of movie where it doesn't matter where you come in, you'll  watch until it's over. Highly recommended.",912729600,,415,4.5675675675675675
393264,5,6301966554,"This classic has become a Christmas tradition in our house.  Not to be viewed until the day after Thanksgiving, we look forward to our last bites of turkey ans stuffing.  The 24-hour marathon last Christmas Eve kept us  company while we wrapped gifts well into the night.  Except for a few swear  words (the movie would NOT be the same without them), I recommend this  movie for the entire family. It should be a part of your permanent video  collection.",912297600,,454,4.6
393265,5,6301966554,"... with this movie, you go back to the good old days when Peter's biggest concern (as Ralphie, the character he played in the film) was  getting ""an official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range  model air rifle"" for Christmas, despite everyone (even a  department-store Santa) telling him he'd put his eye out.
It's a flight  of fancy, incredibly funny, and a movie with which anyone who was ever a  little boy can identify.  Definitely one of those movies that needs to be  pulled out and viewed every Christmas along with classics like ""It's a  Wonderful Life"".",911260800,,578,4.826530612244898

We watched it once a couple years ago.  Just not worth owning.  Maybe if you have VidAngel and you can cut out the language it would be better.",1523318400,,412,4.54054054054054

394623,5,6301966554,"Classic movie! I'm reviewing this from the perspective of a parent of a young child, to help other parents decide if it's appropriate for your kiddos.
First off my Dad always had us watch this around the holidays, and as an adult I've grown to really appreciate it. With its rating I thought, why not let my stepson watch this. He is 5. There is nothing like watching a movie with either your child or your parents to point out to you the tiny things you missed before that you wish weren't happening now.
For my kid I think it was fine, the only ""oops"" moments were when the narrator is talking about the leg lamp and uses the expression ""electrified s*x in the window"". There is also discussion and mention of the F-Bomb, but no actual F Bomb is said, so I think it's fine. It's definitely more appropriate for kids than most of the junk on regular TV these days!
The movie discusses bullying, and shows kids getting in a tussle, so it's a good way to start a conversation about that.

All in all it's a great movie for families.",1514937600,,1031,4.341968911917099

394703,5,6301966554,"The movie that keeps us entertained every Christmas has a nice Steelbook Edition for the 30th Anniversary. Some nice special features as well get transferred over from previous editions with an added ""Anniversary"" featurette interview.

I played this back on my Sony 4K upscaling Blu-ray player and UHD TV. It looked decent, but I think it could have looked better overall. The image was 2160p, so it was nice to see that. If there is ever a 4K version of this, I might have to pick it up. I love this movie and it brings back some good memories as it might for you as well. With the advent of new technology for making movies look and sound better, it appears WB could have paid more attention to this ""classic"" from the early 1980s, image wise.

Still, it's great to have this edition, as I collect the Steelbooks and find them much better than most of the plastic blue cases they distribute that have those annoying arrow ""cutouts"" on the left side. I have taken a picture of the steelbook itself to add to my review. I really like it.",1514419200,,1038,4.457894736842105

Christmas lights just like that and one of my best Christmases was the 1 where I got a Daisy winchester look a like BB gun.  I had that thing until I was almost 30.  It finally wore out.  Must have fired one million BBs.  The Bbs came in a tube just like the movie.  We dressed up pretty much like that incliding those ugly rubber boots which always got wet inside from snow melting.

A time before cell phones and the internet. Back when people gathered around the radio for entertainment. I love this movie and watch it over and over again every Christmas. But I do have one beef and it's not with the video itself. My Blu Ray came in a ""recycled eco-friendly"" Blu Ray case with zero booklets/artwork inside. The disc label was printed in black&white and it also look like it had clearly been re-shrinkwrapped. The disc and everything on it seems fine. But doubleyouteeeef. Penny pinch much?

395005,4,6301966554,"I remember seeing the TV version of a Christmas story for many years since it came out in 1983.  I cant remember seeing it on the big screen, but Im 60 now so sometimes things like that slip away, but I digress. I had the regular DVD version of this movie, and played it for my dad who is a big fan, who watches it several times each season. I thought it would be fun to have the Blu-ray version, so I ordered it thinking that it would be the full theatrical format.  While it does indeed fit the format of my 16:9 ratio TV, it seems to be cropped from the 4:3 ratio version of the regular VHS/DVD version of the movie. I found this out when I loaded both a DVD and Blu-ray in separate players and did flip back-and-forth test between views of the same scene, in several places. This is somewhat disappointing, as Id hoped to be able to see more of the action in the beloved movie. That said, the picture quality of the Blu-ray version is way better than the standard DVD. I would say though that the sound quality of the Blu-ray is a step down. Both are in mono, but the Blu-ray disc, although it has a brighter, more vivid picture, seems to have a more muted sound.

395012,1,6301966554,"You don't need to get your eyes checked, you read it right this is one of the most overrated movies Christmas or not of all time in my opinion. If you were to ask a lot of people of what they think the greatest Christmas movie is, you might hear A Christmas Story get named a lot of times. I am here to tell you that in my opinion of the movie, the main kid in the movie is a dreamer, the narration is terrible and dull. There is not much to like about this movie, and yet somehow is beloved by a lot of people not me. The movie takes place in Indiana somewhere in the 1940's, which also features some references to the Wizard of Oz, even through during the 1940's, The Wizard of Oz was not seen as the classic movie that it is today. The main kid in the movie Ralph badly wants a certain item for Christmas, and even through he doesn't pick up by the adults that he has told, that it is a bad idea. As the movie opens Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) has reveled by his adult narrator voiced by Jean Shepherd, that the item he wants the most for Christmas is a Daisy Red Ryder BB gun, and he is up in his room that he shares with his kid brother Randy (Ian Petrella), in which his Mom (Melinda Dillon) calls up to them, waiting them downstairs in 2 minutes. So he manages to get an ad for the gun in a magazine that he knows his mom reads for a hint. His dad is referred as Old Man Parker (Darren McGavin), he finally decides to tell his Mother what he wants for Christmas to which she responds ""no you will shoot your eye out"". One day at school during recess one of Ralphie's classmates on the worst dares of all time, he dares a boy named Flick (Scott Schwartz) to try out what his father would say happen, his tongue on the flagpole, which gets frozen stuck. The bell rings, which the kids don't know what to do quietly return to the classroom. Where the teacher Miss Shields (Tedde Moore) asks a few times where is Flick, to which a girl points out the window. The teacher goes outside, and soon there is some police, and even firemen to get him off of the flagpole. They return to the classroom, where she announces that he refused to say who put him up to the deed. But leaves a warning, Ralphie's sees a second chance, when Miss Shields assigns for the theme of a paper to be what I want for Christmas, to be turned in the next day. So he writes about what the bb gun, with even day dreams, of her rejecting the other kid's assignments until she reads his, and gives him a A+ and even rights it al over the chalkboard. He does turn it in, but when he gets his assignment back, she gave him a C+ grade, with a PS you will shoot your eye out. On more adult he decides to try, the mall Santa Claus, when the store is closing, and it is his turn in line, Santa Claus (Jeff Gillen) is in a hurry, he says ""how about a nice football"". And he agrees to it, since he couldn't remember what he wanted, his adult self couldn't believe, so he snaps out of it, go back up the slide, and tells Santa, and he says ""you'll shoot your eye out kid"". At one point receives a telegram that e won an award and will be arriving that night, the award turns out to be a lamp, that the body of the lamp is a woman's leg. I would like to know just what caring adult no matter how we'll he or she knows Ralphie, wouldn't say you'll shoot your eye out, that person would have to be a Scrooge. Tow things happen to Raphie, that would be nightmares for a lot of kids I would bet, 1 to have their mouth washed out with soap, and 2 have their item they want for Christmas to be rejected by Santa Claus. This is the movie that TBS and TNT plays a 24 hour marathon of the movie starting Christmas Eve night, and runs until Christmas Day night. I would rather watch paint dry on the wall, then to watch a marathon of this movie. If you have never seen this movie before, skip this movie, take my advice and just take a pass on this movie. But if toy still want to see it, rent it first or catch one of the many shows of it on tv on one of the two stations I have mentioned. If you like the movie, then I would recommend you to buy it, otherwise stay far away.",1511308800,,4129,4.036585365853658

395049,3,6301966554,"Not my type of movie, but probably a good watch for those who like 1940's-esque productions, or for those who watched this movie as a child. I had not watched this as a child, and saw the movie, as it had been described by an acquaintance as ""a classic.""  This being said, the quality of the movie (SD versus HD with playback on an iPad) was below that which I am used to in even older, rented, SD movies, such as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" With ""A Christmas Story,"" the picture could be crisp at one moment, then highly blurred or ""pixelated,"" then mildly blurred. I have watched many other SD movies on an iPad without issue, and am not sure what the problem was with this particular movie. A suggestion, if you like this type of movie (sort of like ""Father Knows Best"" meets ""The Little Rascals""), consider viewing it in HD versus SD for a possibly better viewing experience.",1510099200,,876,4.440993788819876

So just threw it away and went looking at Walmart.  It's sad when item at Walmart was better than Amazon. I think there should be something in the description that gives you a heads up on origin.

It was either a bike or a BB-gun, that made that year special, and honestly, the bike was 20 times more dangerous than a BB-gun.

I finally watched and was disappointed.  I thought it would be a good movie for the kids to see, but no so with the language.  I can see that there are places in the story that every kid can relate to - hoping for that special toy for Christmas, going to see Santa, dealing with bullies, the parent / child relationship and anticipating what was going to happen when ""your father gets home.""  There are a number of classic moments most kids go through, but the story was lacking and slow.  A lot of people like the movie, but for me not so great.  Maybe seeing it first as a child is the key, but like I said the language...  It just wasn't necessary for the movie.",1484006400,,806,4.181818181818182

About a boy who all he wants is a Red Ryder b.b. bun.  And feels like there is a conspiracy against everyone not wanting him to have one.  When I was in 6th Grade all I wanted was a new bike and was obsessed with it.  I felt the same way as Ralphie in the movie.  And I did get one.  Yay!!!!!  Anyway this movie has everything.  From tongues getting stuck on flag poles to the bully of the school to dogs eating the Christmas dinner and having to go to a Chinese Restaurant for Christmas dinner.,1483833600,,643,4.072

I have it on DVD, but leave my TV on TBS each year and watch the overnight marathon between baking batches of Christmas cakes and cookies. Now, that said, I have increasingly found it necessary to change the channel during commercials. Does TBS really believe that the people who are likely to watch this are the same ones who want to see the hip-hop-ering of Christmas? As for the ""new, original comdey content,"" what will it take for TBS to see it's own long trail of failures? The Exes? Kirstie? Conan? Samantha Bee? Angie Tribeca? What is this, ""How To Fail In Television""? TBS should stick to re-running old classics like ""A Christmas Story"", because in the realm of new content, they haven't got a clue.",1482624000,,881,4.582278481012659

398164,3,6301966554,"Rubiks cubes, Trolls dolls, Mr. Potato Heads, View-Masters, Beanie Babies, our childhoods are greatly defined by the popular products we absolutely needed to own no matter what the cost. Among our present-day marketing of the hottest brands that dictate how we live, we now like every Christmas since 1983 get the chance to look back on a time before fads made their way into the childrens subconscious.

In A Christmas Story, we are taken back into the year 1940, before the effects of war altered Americas state of mind forever, and a childs greatest earning was all about stopping the bullies. The classical feel of this picture resonates with every post WWII generation with laughs aplenty that remind us of our own ridiculous family obsessions.
On the snowy Cleveland Street of Northern Indiana, all the residents young and old crowd in front of Hicbees toy store to peek in on the newest brands to add to their wish lists. The blue eyed nine-year-old in the center, Ralphie, has his sight on one thing and one thing only: a Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200 Shot Air Rifle. His younger brother, Randy, would most want a silver zeppelin, and to never eat meat loaf again. His father, known only as the Old Man, wants to keep his prized leg lamp aglow at the front of the house for all of Cleveland Street to witness, a symbol of his victories. The mother of the family wants nothing more than to keep the boys in her life in order. The shenanigans these four get wound up in are humorous to connect with, as we watch their hopes to enjoy this time of year in spite of conflicts.

Everyone has their personal moments of expression to prove how badly they want the thing they want; Ralphie will do anything to prove to his mother that he deserves something as dangerous as a BB gun, Randy refuses to fall victim to his mothers irrational scheme of over bundling him for snow treading, and the Old Man will never turn off his lamp for anything, in spite of his hectic wifes wishes.

There are never large events shown within this average family, only easily relatable moments of everyday living. Cracking a secret code from a childrens radio program or trying on your aunts embarrassing homemade pajamas may not sound like much, but watching these moments linger proves what truly makes the gears of a family spin. Its like the mind of a childthe small stuff, rather than the big stuff, are the things to get excited for.

Yet like any abruptly shifting young mind, the editing style of this feature erases any sense of narrative or fluidity. But its made up for with the consistent voiceover narration by a grown-up Ralphie who comments on what he remembers from his best Christmas ever. With this special aid, we also get a glimpse into the fantasies this nine-year-old came up with in response to the adults in his world, as inspired by genres of popular radio serials.

Its so effective, that I now feel like a part of this historic era, as looked at from the mind of a child. Although the depiction of Blacks, Asians, and Hillbillies takes out a bit of the experience, as it reflects more the racial relations of the early 1980s than the setting.

But returning us into the experience is the no-nonsense attitude that does not over glamorize the seasons commercial happiness. Set aside the jingle bells and Claymation reindeer, this special has a rude mall Santa, a poor boys tongue frozen to a flagpole, a slipping of the F-bomb from a nine-year-olds mouth, and the quarrel between hapless victims and the schoolyard bullies. Youth cant look more real than this.

In fact, the youth depiction here may as well be a little too real. As the boys always lose their sense in favor of impulsive decisions without any real punishment, it essentially teaches the mothers that boys should be boys, and we might as well just enjoy the moment. Now, does that mean that mothers should let their boys get away with lying, giving kids nosebleeds, and mocking blind people like as seen in this special? I don't think so.

Well, maybe the possessive madness in the 1940s proves how not much of anything has changed over time after all. Imagine that.",1481241600,,4137,4.665294924554184

brings back such vivid memories of young families after the war
buying their first house, having to pinch pennies to make ends meet
and trying to keep an old car together. The cold, cold weather and old
fashioned snowsuits(not so funny then)but funny to look back on now.
What younger brother or sister did not get dared to stick their tongue on
a frozen pipe or metal rail? This movie is an all time great! M L Clark",1480118400,,483,4.204301075268817

The soap poisoning fantasy, fragile and the leg lamp, you'll shoot your eye out. This movie is relatable and I think that's what gives it staying power. Who didn't have a bully who drive him crazy or an annoying sibling or relative? Who hasn't ever wanted something and everyone seemed against you? Or had vivid fantasies about life that never came true? Ralph wants a red Ryder bb gun. He wants it more than anything. His mother is a harried housewife and his father has a potty mouth and is constantly battling the furnace. His little brother is annoying and life is never dull with Ralph's friend around.

We all grew up hearing our parent 's and everyone else warn us, too, about getting shot in the eye with a bb gun .My generation could certainly identify with so much in that family, that it's almost like seeing a rerun of an old family movie.

398593,3,6301966554,"I love the movie, but the Blu-Ray could be a lot better.  The only available audio track is a English Dolby Mono track, which my system doesn't handle well at all.  If they recorded the thing in mono, then they should at least fake a stereo (or remix it to a 5.1/7.1).  The picture quality of the Blu-Ray I don't think is any better than a DVD/HDTV version (with the caveat being that it wasn't exactly filmed with the highest quality film in the first place).
The fact I like the movie is the only reason it got 3 stars here.  The aforementioned flaws bring it down two stars.",1477612800,,577,4.26605504587156

398807,5,6301966554,"I truly cannot say enough good things about this movie and I cannot even begin to calculate how many times I've seen it but without exaggeration it is definitely in the hundreds.

Without giving too much away this is the story of Ralphie, a young boy, who is wishing for a specific BB Gun for Christmas.  His attempts at hinting fail and he's often met with ""You'll shoot your eye out"".  Ralphie lives with his younger brother, mother and father.  The story takes place in Indiana around 1940 yet the movie itself was made in the 80's.  Peter Billingsly as many who lived in the 80's will remember as ""Messy Marvin"" in chocolate milk commercials, plays Ralphie.  This movie is a comedy.

Almost 20 years ago the cable network TNT started running A Christmas Story for 24 hours straight starting on Christmas Eve.  That tradition is now shown on both TNT and TBS and is a complete classic.  The movie is dripping with nostalgia that the young and old alike will fall in love with.  It is by far my favorite holiday movie and although it's become a tradition to leave the 24 hour marathon on of it every Christmas Eve, there is something about watching it on DVD that makes it that much more special as you do have to deal with the commercial interruptions when it's on television.  If you have seen it on TV but never uninterrupted I cannot urge you enough to pick up a copy of the DVD and watch it in all it's uninterrupted 'leg lamp' glory.  You won't be disappointed.",1468627200,,1469,4.46067415730337

A definite must to add to your movie and Christmas collection.  Why does everyone love this movie?  I think we all see some of ourselves in Ralphie.  He is a lovable mix of cuteness, insecurity, confidence, curiousity, and being afraid- the exact mix of emotions we all endured while trying to get through that most wonderful and awful thing called adolescence.

You'll hear catchphrases that are still popular to this day (""You'll shoot your eye out!""). This is sure to be a holiday favorite for as long as you live.",1458432000,,476,4.241758241758242

I use the tin to store the cookie cutters and recipe booklet.  And of course having the DVD makes it super easy to watch the movie whenever we want to, without commercials.

399273,5,6301966554,"This is possibly the best and funniest representation of an average Midwest family's Christmas with all the eccentricities relatives bring to the event.

It's an enduring tale of a young boy's ardent desires to own a Red Rider BB gun and the frustrations of being told ""you're too young, it's too dangerous"".  In the 50's, this was pretty much the end-all, be-all thing for a boy - or a girl as Dale Evans could shoot as well as the guys.  This is also when you could collect points for buying comic books and/or sell items from them for more points to order real chemistry sets, even master ones you could create and blow things up!

It's a tale of a bye gone era with a type of innocence we'll never see again.  Information was not so easily obtained, kids stayed kids for far longer than they do today.

I highly recommend watching it several times, as you'll catch something different just about every time.",1456272000,,911,4.524390243902439

400130,5,6301966554,"I am admittedly biased, but I LOVE this movie.  This is one of the only movies I have ever seen that captured the way the world really looks in the eyes of a child.  The perception of bullies, peer pressure (kid who was double dog dared to put his tongue on a freezing flag pole), and the feeling that getting something through the mail as a kid authenticates you in the world.  But to be clear, this is not a smarmy tiptoe through childhood.  This is a comedy, from beginning to end.  The sadistic Santa that steps on Ralphie's face to get him to go down the slide, the bunny outfit that Ralphie had to wear because one of his relatives made it for him, Darren McGavin's constant battles with his furnace, the Chinese restaurant they had to go to on Christmas because the neighbor's dogs ate the thanksgiving turkey.

400171,5,6301966554,"A Christmas Story is a classic American Christmas tale.  A young boy schemes to get his mitts on a Red Ryder BB Gun, the Holy Grail of Christmas gifts for any young boy.  Pure poetry.  Jean Shepherd does a masterful job of writing and narrating.  Absolutely perfect!  The cast is top-notch from top to bottom and through and through.

Peter Billingsley plays the role of Ralph to perfection.  The round face, the scheming look, and the gang of pals is pure Americana.

Every year my wife puts together a ""Christmas Chain"".  Each link in the chain is made of paper and lists a family activity or event for every day from 1 December through Christmas Eve.  One of the family favorites is ""Fa-ra-ra-ra-ra"".  On that day we go out and eat Chinese food, then go home and watch ""A Christmas Story.""  We only watch it once a year, for that activity.  By the time we watch it again it's fun and fresh.  And the movie quotes, oh man!  They are rich!

Here are a few favorites:
""My father wove a tapestry of obscenity that as far as we know is still hovering someplace over Lake Michigan.""
""You'll poke your eye out, kid!""
""A plus, plus, plus, plus.""
""Maybe Miss Shields would excuse me from theme writing for the rest of my natural life!""
""But what is it?...It's a MAJOR AWARD.""
""We don't want to waste electricity!""
and
""I had pulled it off!""
...among many, many others.

I can't say enough good about this absolutely fun film.  It works for the whole family

It's worth an A ++++++

400365,3,6301966554,"OK, I know I'm going to get some people calling me ""un-American"" for only giving this film three stars, but it's never quite appealed to me like some of the other classics do.

Ralphie, the main character, is actually quite shallow. Most of the film revolves around his desire for a BB gun, which almost becomes unhealthy. He's not likable in the way Kevin is in Home Alone. Kevin has a big personality, is faced with incredible tasks, and shows the creative genius of his 8 year old self. Ralphie is just an average kid who deals with a school bully and a mother who doesn't want to get him a BB gun over fears of eye injuries. True, he may be more relatable for some people, but he just seems like a stock character.

There are definitely some classic scenes in this movie, but imagine how much better it would have been if Ralphie had a little more personality or if there was a great supporting character by his side. The dysfunctional family does add some dimensionality to things, but even in their best scenes, they don't really add any deep plot twists. Speaking of supporting characters, the teacher is one of the better ones, but the Santa Claus scene seems a bit of a stretch for the 1940 setting. Sure, he may have cautioned about shooting an eye out, but I doubt any department store would have had a setup as elaborate as the one in the film (which works great for effect, but not accuracy).

The entire movie just seems like someone's diary from Christmas, played out as a film, without a good movie plot. There are some funny moments, but to me, this isn't so much as ""story"" as it as a ""sequence of events"" which just so happen to have a desire for a particular BB gun in common to link them together. It isn't a movie I make a point to watch at Christmas, but it is at least palatable and has a few funny moments.

One thing to point out--the movie wasn't actually a big success when it first came out. It seems as though it became an acquired taste in American culture. I'm curious to see what the people who actually saw it in 1983 thought of it.",1451347200,,2066,4.344559585492228

Still, all in all it's great. I am; however, disappointed with Amazon as this is the SECOND gift I've received where they're the retailer and the Digital HD Ultraviolet redemption code had expired. I'm going to try to return it, but since it's a movie I'm not sure how that'll go.  There aren't many companies who support returning movies, music, or software.

400481,1,6301966554,"A dreadful and gloomy Anti-Christmas movie created by misanthropic creeps. The director, Bob Clark, also helmed the degenerate teen T&A flick ""Porky's""

What's with all the screaming and yelling in this movie? Too much coke on the set? ""SCREAM MORE! MORE! YEAH! PERFECT! SCREAMING IS FUNNY!""

The Santa and elves were intentionally grotesque and twisted.  Did the creators not enjoy Christmas as children? Maybe their parents wouldn't let them celebrate Christmas and this is some type of twisted revenge?

I used to think this was a pretty decent film, but, with the eyes of an adult, I see that this is just another ""Anti-Christmas Christmas movie"".

This degenerate and subversive film is heralded as a modern classic; what a joke. Are there any true classic Christmas movies made after say, 1964?

The only reason I'm rating it at four stars instead of five has to do with its closed captioning.  We have an adult relative who is deaf, so for the first time we displayed the closed captioning as we watched the film this year.  We had several children in the room and we were surprised and disappointed to see very explicit curse words running across the bottom of the screen, especially in those scenes when Darren McGavin was dealing with his furnace and everything else that annoyed him.  When you're listening to the dialogue, you don't catch the actual words because he mumbles them, but the people who did the captioning apparently decided to go with the script, or perhaps what they assumed he was saying.  I still love the film, but I suggest that parents of children avoid the captioning, unless of course it isn't a big deal for you.",1449100800,,1015,4.51912568306011

All other extras from the previous Blu-ray release are still here, as well as a DVD copy of the film.  Wrap all this up in an attractive steelbook case and you've got a wonderful gift.

What a lot of people don't know is that the narrator, Jean Shepherd, also wrote all of the short stories that make up the movie. The Bumpus Hounds is a story, Scut Farcus is another, lady's leg is another... All put together to make a great movie.
I highly recommend the books he has written with those stories: In God We Trust and Wanda Hickey. Good stuff.
My favorite line that didn't make the movie is, as Dad tried to glue the lamp, ""he uses the kind of glue they use to put together exploded locomotives."" The imagery is priceless.
F-R-A-G-I-L-E (watch the movie for that one).",1449014400,,657,4.43801652892562

quality is terrible.  We had a 20th edition and lost it.  We have watched that edition for the last 10 years, over and over during the Christmas season.  It was clear, brighter and just a better quality.  When we couldn't find it, we ordered this DVD from Amazon.com. This copy from Amazon STINKS!  The back of the DVD cover says standard version just like the 20th edition however, this one was made in Mexico...It's dull, dark, and at times very blurry.  Also, the quality of sound is terrible, lagging.  We wondered if it was because we have HD TV, but sound shouldn't be affected.  The five of us agreed as we were watching, this is a terrible copy. Buyer BEWARE.  Spend a little more $ and get the digital updated copy. Look for 30th edition or something that says digitally updated.

The only reason I will not buy it anytime soon is because TBS plays this movie for 24 hours starting on Christmas Eve through all day Christmas Day. Maybe once TBS stops doing that, then I would buy me a copy of this movie. Now, if you are someone that wants to see all the behind the scenes stuff, then definitely buy a copy so you can have all the goodies. But if you are just a seasonal watcher that only watches it for the CHRISTmas season, then just watch it on TBS starting Dec. 24 6PM East Time lol",1446768000,,635,3.96875

They even made us watch it in school, which I still don't understand.  All I can figure is that it must appeal to the most ""common"" element of society.  The boy is antagonistic and unfriendly.  The family odd.  And spending Christmas eating at a Chinese restaurant is definitely unappetizing.

last but not certainly not least, is it does what all Christmas movies i have watched have failed to do: to capture the magic and the spirit of Christmas time, and i can picture families sitting in front of the TV in the living room on Christmas Eve, rejoicing and enjoying this film on the most celebrated seasonal festivity of the year",1444780800,5,968,4.377777777777778

Ralphie is forced to name a friend, since his mom is clearly living in denial. We hear the friend getting beaten over the phone, wailing, ""What did I do? What did I do?"" Well, he didn't do anything. (Not that it would really be OK if he had.)

401632,5,6301966554,"If a movie is judged purely on the number of times people watch it, then ""A Christmas Story"" has to be one of the best movies ever made.  Chock full of original and funny story ideas and great lines, it is a delight from beginning to end.

""A Christmas Story"" is a tale of a normal American family (from around 1940) in the days leading up to Christmas ... as seen through the eyes of a 9 year-old boy (Ralphie).  Ralphie wants a BB gun for Christmas, but his mom, his teacher ... and even Santa Claus ... are against the idea.  Undeterred, he never gives up his hope, and when he does finally get ""the best Christmas present that I had ever received ... or would ever receive""  we, the audience,  rejoice in his triumph.

Excellently written, ""A Christmas Story"" is based on the childhood memories of writer and radio talk show host Jean Shepherd ... who co-wrote the movie's script.  Mr. Shepherd also narrates the movie ... with the gusto and fun of the 9 year-old still inside him ... and has a cameo in the film as well (as the man who chides Ralphie in the department store, ""Hey kid.  Where do you think you're going?"")

The casting was perfect.  Peter Billingsley is a surprisingly excellent little actor.  He manages subtleties that are beyond the range of most performers.  Melinda Dillon is very good as the mom. Darren McGavin is extremely entertaining and funny as the impatient dad.  Tedde Moore is simply excellent as Ralphie's teacher Miss Shields.  And all the kids in the movie are enjoyably believable.

Some serious money was spent on the making of this movie. Notice the Christmas parade scene or the department store scene, and imagine creating them ... from scratch.  But it is the charm of ""A Christmas Story"" that gives it its enduring appeal.  The dreams and imagination and adventures of this young boy pull us into this movie ... and make us want to stay there.",1424044800,,1889,4.554896142433234

The story is funny, and entertains from start to finish. Delightful, fun-filled, and entertaining. Highly recommended!",1419897600,,519,5.190476190476191

We had to put something in context for then from a timeline point, but that only made them laugh more. Great family movie.  Note: if you have believers still skip the 30 seconds when they stuff them to bed and get the presents. We sent ours for ice cream from the fridge. Perfect. Enjoy!",1419897600,,392,4.157894736842105

402394,1,6301966554,NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN!!!!  We didn't even watch it past 5 minutes.  There was so many bad words in it that I turned it off after only a few minutes.  You would think with this being a CHIRSTMAS movie and having the main character as a child that it would be something for children to watch.  That couldn't be further from the truth.  Let me clarify....I can handle a movie with a few bad words in it but what I especially can't stand is a CHIRSTMAS movie having language like this one did AND making the children in the movie say them! How low can you go!  Our children are exposed to enough of this stuff in everyday life little own letting our littlest ones think that it is ok at such a young age!! Why would you make the children actors say things like that?  I would give it away but I don't think anyone should watch this movie so in the garbage it goes!  Thanks for making me waste my money!(Glad I didn't give this as a gift to anyone! How embarrassing!!!),1419811200,3,967,4.1891891891891895

The older I get, and the more often I view this, the more I see how perfectly Darren McGavin nails to role as the dad in the story, his furious reaction to the broken furnace, the wacky lamp and even his final, determined dinner plans following the country dogs running off with the turkey. There's just so much to enjoy about this film that a review just can't do justice. The content is tame, although there is a creepy bully (complete with appropriate 'Peter and the Wolf' sountrack music) and a brief fight scene with a bloody nose, but that's probably the single worst part (other than a brief, near-profanity sequence that adults will pick up that's over the heads of most kids.) It's a very silly film and a lot of fun for the family.",1419206400,,822,4.523489932885906

I HATE THIS MOVIE. A Christmas story has TERRIBLE WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!! You think horror movies are nerve wreaking, but the people do things that make me feel beyond terrified and get me to a point of screaming in the movie. First, Raphie's younger brother screams and cries because his mommy puts on too much winter stuff on him and he cries ""I can't move my arms!"", and the mom ignores him. My classmates and others found it funny, but that made my tummy sink and I had to keel in order to keep from screaming and throwing up at the same time. I couldn't see the part where a boy sticks his tongue on a wood pole. When I thought it was safe, the bullying started. I hid in the girl's bathroom. I also felt sick when an elf forcefully placed Raphie's younger brother on Santa's lap and Santa scared him by loudly saying ""Ho,Ho, Ho."" I had to sit out the rest of the movie.

403040,5,6301966554,"Holds up to repeated semi-annual viewings, the characters are nicely over-the-top, characterized truly from a kid's point of view. Nostalgia with a nice twist, you might recognize yourself or a situation whether alive during this era or not. This familiarity is how A Christmas Story has accrued its classic status.
I remember when it was first released and the timing was awkward, it was out a couple of weeks too soon before Christmas to gain a huge holiday audience. Nonetheless as word got around over the years it gained staus as a viewing tradition for many families. Not easy to compete with It's A Wonderful Life but this one is right up there. Solid storytelling and period design is spot on.
From a couple of discrepancies in the dated items shown in the film (clothes, decoder rings, newspapers, sports trades) there is some debate as to what year this story is ""supposed"" to have taken place. But I chose to think that it's pre-war (or even post war), at any rate a time of innocence for the kids. It's their fantasy and it becomes ours, the desire for a particular Christmas gift being the most important thing in the world without feeling guilty for posessing that degree of materialism. It's good to enjoy that age again and this film takes us there superbly and in sublime fashion.",1419033600,,1297,4.71806167400881

In our family we have a very traditional way of approaching the Christmas season. As Christmas draws near the requirements for being our families video of the night becomes more and more stringent. For example, movies such as Rudolph the red nose reindeer and frosty, while good movies, are reserved for the first week of December. There are still some really great movies that are out there and will likely push this movie back to the week prior to Christmas however that puts it in our top eight movies for the holiday season. Five stars all the way great acting, Great production great direction great feel. All-around a wonderful Christmas story perhaps thats why they call it a Christmas story.

I remember friends' houses that were heated with coal furnaces and the noise and dirt associated with them.  There are some classic lines and props in this well-acted and well-written screenplay.  Oh, and everytime I or my brothers asked for a BB gun, we were told ""you'll shoot someone's eye out"", what a classic line.",1418947200,,546,4.587628865979381

He didn't laugh at everything but it was obvious that this movie really touched the Christmas spirit within him.  Eventually, I took the time to watch it and it found the same soft spot in my Christmas heart as his.  Even though we didn't live in the midwest, there are plenty of Christmas traditions that every family from the Boomer and Greatest Generation can identify with.  Presently, I am adamant about watching this movie at least once during this joyous season but I often watch it multiple times.  It's just one of those kind of movies, like a catchy tune, that I can watch over and over again and continue to appreciate it as much as the last time.  This was the first time I watched it in HD on our new 65"" big screen.  The resolution, color and depth is astonishing.  It was like being right in the scenes with them.

How does one get useful information here about a specific product when amazon lumps together reviews of EVERY VERSION ever released, written over a span of decades???  We all know the movie itself and its many charms, and I would guess that the majority of folks shopping for A Christmas Story already like/love/LOVE it.  So I will confine my comments to one specific product: The 2008 ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"", which ships in a metal canister and includes a string of ""leg lamp lights"" along with the Blu-ray disc.  First, the disc: As a few others have pointed out, there's not much new here, compared with earlier DVD releases--just a commentary track, a few trailers and recycled special features from the 20th anniversary (2003) DVD release (still in standard definition).  The main feature is a mediocre transfer with way more digital artifacts than should be present in an HD Blu-ray release.  Still, I doubt that most viewers would notice or care--it's a nostalgia-soaked holiday feel-good movie, after all.  The leg lamp lights are actually pretty well done--ten mini leg lamps about 3-3/4"" tall that stretch out to nearly ten feet.  Best of all, the legs themselves radiate ""the soft glow of electric sex"" as Jean Shepherd would have wanted.  As for the tin, it's a functional canister which can hold things, such as holiday baked goodies; but would it have killed them to print some images from the movie on the sides and back?  (The decorative borders wrap around, but frame nothing--just more green metal.)  I'm withholding one star for the shamelessly ""half-fast"" execution, but of course, the movie itself rates a big five.  Note: Recently this set has been offered for much less than standalone sets of leg lamp lights on amazon, so you could buy it for the lights and get the movie & tin as a bonus.  Ho, ho, ho!",1418947200,,1860,4.848101265822785

Not sure if it's one to watch every year, however (as I do  the 1951 ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alastair Sim as Scrooge, or ""It's A Wonderful Life"" with Jimmy Stewart & Donna Reed).

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused. For me, the intrigue of this movie was less about Ralphie (the main character) and more about the eccentric father and how diametrically opposed the mother was. How in the heck did THESE two hook up? Given that, the movie takes a somewhat surprising but very warm, heartfelt turn - and you're left feeling that all is right with the world.",1418860800,2,717,4.383458646616542

403169,3,6301966554,"OK, so the title of this review is a bit harsh, but I think I got ripped off...
I give this 3 Stars. The movie is a classic worth 5 stars on it's own, but you expect a little more from an HD Anniversary edition.
Pros:

+ Comes with Digital (UV) and DVD copy (one or both are standard these days with Blu-Ray discs)
+ Nice tin case

Cons:

- Mono DTS Sound (Instead of 2, 6, or 8 audio channels, it has one... but it has a REALLY high bitrate, so they thought that was good enough)
- No noticeable visual improvement over the DVD in this same box...

In Short... Don't get this, get the DVD as cheap as you can get it, and wait until someone actually takes the short amount of time needed to remaster this movie correctly. There is absolutely NO noticeable difference between the Blu Ray and the DVD in my Blu-ray player.

Most of the time, there is a night and day difference when watching a DVD vs Blu Ray, even when using an up-converting DVD player (which my Blu-Ray player does with DVDs)... This is an exception... I honestly think they just copied it from a DVD using some up-conversion software... 30th Anniversary Blu Ray? not worth it.

Edit:
Since writing this review, I have done a few shot-to-shot comparisons of the BluRay vs DVD... The BluRay is slightly crisper, but not much. You really have to look at tiny details to see it, but most of the screen looks identical. Having seen several older movies that have been correctly remastered for BluRay, this is a disappointment in comparison... I still think it's worth waiting and living with the DVD copy unless you can find the BluRay version cheap.",1418774400,11,1613,4.414141414141414

403297,1,6301966554,"Call me a Scrooge if you want, but this is absolutely, positively, the biggest waste of time I've ever forced myself to sit through! Honestly, if I hadn't paid $3.99 to rent it in HD, I NEVER would have sat through it.

Although the movie takes place a few years before I was born, I could relate to a lot of what was going on. Yeah yeah, I heard the ""Don't shoot your eye out!"" warnings, myself. But what's so funny about that? Getting your tongue stuck to the flagpole? That was perhaps made sort of funny in Dumb and Dumberwhich, come to think of it, describes this movie PERFECTLY!

The parents were caricatures, and the seemingly endless fast-motion chases by the bullies... well, let's say it just bored me the first time and made me roll my eyes every other time.

DON'T even compare this with any of the real Christmas classics from the 1940s. As sappy as those are, at least they have class... Something this movie will never have!

I'm an avid movie fan, and I'm not here to trash all American-made movies and bemoan the sad state of Hollywood movies today. But after reading dozens of glowing reviews, I decided to keep an open mind and try watching it. Won't make that mistake again. Ever. Promise.

403876,3,6301966554,"A Christmas Story is the best Holiday movie ever made, but you already knew that. This is a review of the Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray (2008). The picture and sound quality are fine (adequate, but not great). My main gripe is with the product description on Amazon. It claims that this version of the blu-ray contains special features that it does not in fact contain. The following special features are included on this disc:
Commentary with Peter Billingsley and director/co-writer Bob Clark
20th Anniversary Documentary Another Christmas Story
Daisy Red Rider: A History Featurette
Get a Leg Up Featurette
Script Pages
Theatrical Trailer
The following are the special features that Amazon claims are included on this disc, but are not:
Original readings by Jean Shepard, author and voice narrator of A Christmas Story
Triple Dog Dare Interactive Trivia
Decoder Match Challenge
Hidden Presents
I don't know which DVD/Blu-ray version contains these features, if any, and Amazon apparently doesn't either.
Amazon makes deciding which DVD/Blu-ray version of a movie to buy difficult because it combines all of the reviews for that movie together and displays them all for each different version. If the product page for the Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray only displayed reviews for the Ultimate Collector's Edition Blu-ray, making the decision to buy it would be a lot easier. Chances are that someone buying a movie has already seen it and likes it, so a review of the VHS version saying the movie is awesome does not help someone looking to buy a Blu-ray version of the movie. Accurate details about picture/sound quality and special features, on the other hand, would be helpful.",1415232000,,1695,5.189781021897811

404309,5,6301966554,"A Christmas Story, 1983 film

The film begins in winter, children await Christmas. The cars suggest the 1930s. Kids view a department store window. Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun. People listen to ""The Lone Ranger"". Mother knows there is danger with such a toy. [Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.] Remember those snow suits? Would they act up in class? Would they stick out their tongue? What do they want for Christmas? What did his Dad win? How do the piggies eat? What an artistic lamp? They don't make them like that anymore! Remember 15 minute radio programs? Remember tires that often went flat? Getting your mouth washed out with soap? [Was 'Lava' worse than 'Lifebuoy'?] ""A crummy commercial!""

Ralph's father fights with the furnace. His Mom has an accident with that lamp. Ralphie learns about peaceful coexistence in the alley. Can he ask Santa for that BB gun? We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era. Santa Claus warns him about that BB gun. Christmas arrives, Santa left a load of toys. Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie. Isn't it cute? ""What's that behind the desk?"" Ralphie learns that a BB gun is dangerous when not properly supervised. [A metal backing ricochets towards the shooter.] An open door is dangerous when there are hungry dogs outside. Where can they find a restaurant on Christmas Day? They'll always remember that day.

Jean Shephard had a late-night radio show from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. He would reminisce about the days of yesteryear, as in this film. He wrote books during this era. The fact that he lost an eye in childhood was a secret. You can surmise the cause. Any gun is a danger when mishandled by an inexperienced child. BB air guns were originally designed as a toy or tool for adults or responsible children. If you remember another version you'll know they were more explicit about the damage to the eyeglasses. This film shows how commercials to children are used to control buying by adults.

Jean Shephard in fact lost an eye by a ricochet from his BB gun! He was an amateur radio operator. How did he get into the Army with a glass eye? He memorized the chart and could ""see"" with his glass eye!",1408924800,3,2226,4.6421319796954315

404365,5,6301966554,"What can one say about this classic, that has not already been said?  We'll how about the fact that I did not like it at first. From a young age (3) I realized I did not like braty whiny kids. Born in the 70's, I grew up with this movie, but never really watched it until I was in my late 20's.

 I had always stayed away from it because it seemed that every time the main star opened his mouth, he was whining about that damn BB Gun.  It was not until I got married and my husband forced me to watch it one year that I realized it was not all that bad.  I still can't stand whiny kids, so the fact that I can watch it with out tearing my hair out says something.

The whole story was good, from start to finish. The characters are lively and well played.  The story flows without any downtime AND this could really be your family or a family that you grew up with.  No matter your station in life, wether you are rich or poor as a church mouse, you will be able to relate in one way or the other.

 I wish all movies made you feel this way.  In a time where we are losing wholesome family movies, it's refreshing to step back in time and enjoy that family unity once more.  This is definitely a ""gather the whole family"" movie.  A cult classic to be shared with all.  I now watch it every year (but no more than two times).",1407456000,,1324,3.965909090909091

My Father absolutely loved this movie and we felt it fitting to include the dvd with his memorial.
I even included an actual piece of the house where the movie was filmed  and a miniature leg lamp.
To some this might have seemed strange but to us it was quite fitting.
The movie will be around for a lot longer than we will but in this case someday in the far far future someone may find this on a excavation and they may get a laugh as well.",1406246400,,652,4.054263565891473

404447,5,6301966554,"The prevalence of guns and bullies in this movie is already starting to work against it as a holiday classic. You don't see it as much as you used to around the holidays, and I don't think it's just because people are tried of watching 24/7 on WTBS during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

Which is a shame, because I don't think that the movie in any way endorses a gun culture among kids, though I do think that the light-hearted take on bullying is a little hard to take. But for the most part, I admire how director Bob Clark created a very credible recreation of the time in which he confronts the realities of poverty among the working classes. He also targets how merchandisers have cheapened Christmas with advertising. Yet Christmas emerges unscathed from the movie seeming just as fresh and sacred as ever.

The movie has so much going for it that I'm hoping everything that's good in it will survive the current national climate of gun violence and bullying in our schools. Somehow, I doubt it.",1405641600,,1005,4.5777777777777775

404449,5,6301966554,"This is a collection of tales as they are recollected by a person thinking back on their childhood one Christmas. It has all the exaggerations with its ups and downs.

Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) spots a ""Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB"" 200-shot Carbine with compass, in the window of a story and fantasizes on how to get it for Christmas.
Will he succeed?
And if so will he shoot his eye out?

I had one of those Davie Crocket hats when I was a kid. There were lots of other items and actions that I could relate to. However my wife likes the watering method used by Melinda Dillon (mother) around the trophy. And she likes the way the mother conserved electricity by turning it off. I could see her snickering through the corner of my eye. I am not sure I should have bought this movie. It may prove fatal to any window plans.

The sequel of ""A Christmas Story"" (""It Runs in the Family"" [1994]) lacks a lot of the originality of this one.

From the bully with the yellow eyes and being chased down the alley, the Palmolive soap to wash your mouth out (which we got frequently), the snow suit where the little brother couldn't put his arms down (my sister had that red snow suit and the same problem, she walked to school with her arms in the air. Ha! She did look like she was going to pop), the dad who cussed at the furnace (how well I remember that), laying in all that Christmas wrap at the end of the frenzied unwrapping and hearing Dad say to Mama: ""My, gosh, would you look at all that mess!""  I remember the meatloaf, mashed potatoes, the aroma of Mama's cooking drifting outside from time to time, and hearing the dogs barking away.  It kind of saddens me to watch it, not because it isn't a wonderful movie, but because I miss some of my growing up years, and this movie takes me back in time to the good and not so good parts of it.  Oh, and last but not least, the 'Red Ryder BB Gun', my brother had to have one, and the words of my Mama: ""You'll shoot your eye out!""

Of course, EVERYONE has seen this by now, so you know what I'm talking about.  If you're one of the 15 or so people in America who haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and correct that as soon as you can.

As other reviewers have said, if you have a previous special anniversary non-Blu Ray DVD, this could be worth purchasing.  Since they also include a DVD of the movie along with the Blu Ray DVD, when you compare the two, it does make sense to own a blu ray copy.

There's little things that get edited out on TV, it's nice to sit back and watch it seamlessly, and the part where Ralphie fights Scut always brings a tear.

He was a Ford man, and would defend his choice of car like Mc Gavin loved his Oldsmobile's.  His salty language was used around the house, much to my mothers' distressed and when I let one epitaph lose, I was given the lifebuoy soap treatment. And she wondered where I had heard it?  My mom didn't want me to get a Red Ryder BB gun, and used the same dialog ""you'll shoot your eye out"".  I had a younger brother who wouldn't eat his vegetables, and would stick them anywhere except his mouth.  My Dad was an expert at fixing things, and somehow thought swearing helped. One of my  friends actually was talked into sticky his tongue on a pole in winter. Our Christmas tree had those 7 watt bulbs that could burn down a tree if the extension plug didn't burst into a ""blue ozone"" before. The film is set in a northern city like where I grew up.  We would go to downtown and look into the Christmas displays. It was one of our rituals that have been lost.

It is very much hyped as one of the best Christmas films of all time and amazingly funny.  The reality is that it neither pans out as humorous nor truly a Christmas film.  The acting is fine and the story is reasonably written but it is devoid of the sort of moments and laughs that make a supposedly memorable film memorable.  It is not a not-my-taste issue but simply, not a particularly good movie.  It is quite simply boring.  If not for the few elements of nostalgia, it would be of absolutely no value whatsoever.  It would seem that this is yet another example of the simpleness of people who prefer to mindlessly adhere to hype rather than make independent evaluations as if somehow dissenting would be a source of personal embarrassment.  Furthermore, for a so-called wholesome family film, there is a fair amount of profanity in it to which I would choose not to expose young children.",1387670400,2,1009,4.597765363128492

There are classic memorable scenes as well, including dinner in a Chinese restaurant with waiters attempting to sing Christmas carols in broken English.  I can no longer hear ""ho ho ho!"" without hearing in my head the way that the Santa in A Christmas Story says it.

One of my favorite parts is where he finally receives his Ovaltine de-coder in the mail... things like this actually did happen back then! Ralphie's father is somewhat self-centered, but when Ralphie gets his BB gun, you really understand how he did care about others, rather than just himself. There's a few language issues, which I wish substitutes could have been used to get the message across - so, I recommend parents viewing the movie first to make sure it's appropriate for your child. I feel many people enjoy this movie, and it just gets better over the years I've watched it... noticing things I missed before. To me, it's a bit exaggerated on some things that make for a good laugh, and the family seems a little ""different"" - but, all in all- it's probably more like the old days than not!

Even the cars in this movie were still around and the house's looked the same. This movie is a great escape from the sick world we now have to live in.

One of the most beloved holiday movies of all-time was having its 30th anniversary, and there's a huge fanbase waiting and willing to pay for the ultimate in a quality remastering of both the video and audio of A Christmas Story. So what do we get? Some modest tweaks to the mono audio and no video improvements at all. It's such a cynical ploy to re-sell the same movie while making the most minimal effort possible to improve it, that it feels like Scut Farkus just took my money.

While I appreciate the added featurette, this 30th Anniversary Edition could have been and should have been SO much better than this.

407990,5,6301966554,"I was almost finished recording ""A Christmas Story"" on one Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.

That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.

Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""

As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.

Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.

Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.

And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others.

Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.

""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...",1384214400,5,2997,4.772200772200772

Extras: Being able to access an HD digital version is a plus, and the BD includes a new featurette entitled ""Christmas in Ohio: A Christmas Story House,"" which runs 21:19 and features an all-growed-up Ian Petrella (aka Randy) and Brian Jones, founder of the ""A Christmas Story House"" in Cleveland. Also, the original recordings by Jean Shepherd that appeared on the 20th-anniversary DVD edition but were missing on the earlier BD have returned. What's still missing are the 20th-anniversary trivia & decoder ring extras from the DVD, which were sort of lame anyway. Watching some of the extras as the participants keep referring to the 20th anniversary of the film (the edition for which the extras were originally filmed) emphasizes how little updating was done for this 30th Anniversary BD Edition.

This 2-disc set includes a DVD as well - it includes both widescreen and full screen versions of the film. The BD contains only the widescreen version. Packaging is a steel book.

I can identify with the time period, so it's nostalgia seeing how my Christmases were back in the day. My grandmother had the same type of kitchen sink & washing machine. We would go downtown to see all the stores decorated & visit with Santa.
Ralph is a junior Walter Mitty with all his daydreams/fantasies.
Love the Old Man [who later will be Karl Kolcheck, The Night Stalker]. The mom is overworked & overtired in her ""traditional"" role as homemaker.
There are just too many favorite scenes to mention. Ralphie's big blue eyes filling with tears & then - he attacks the bully. Yeah, we cheer him on. The bar of soap in Ralph's mouth for swearing. I used all those soaps mentioned & had a couple put into my mouth as well. Grandma didn't mess around.
The kicker scene is Santa saying, ""you'll shoot your eye out kid"", & pushing an open mouthed, shocked & shattered Ralph down the slide with his foot. Ralph thought that only Santa would understand & could help him get his Red Ryder BB gun.

If you've only seen this movie as part of the ""24 Hours of..."" broadcast on TBS every Christmas Eve/Day, you owe it to yourself to see it in this GREAT print, uninterrupted by commercial breaks and blaring through your stereo speakers like you were in a movie theater.

The BD includes both the widescreen and full screen versions of the movie. I prefer the widescreen myself (though you can watch the full screen version just to see the trampoline that Black Bart uses to jump the fence and mount his horse as he flees the imagined wrath of Ralphie's blue-steel beauty - the trampoline isn't visible in the WS version).

This CE also contains a set of Leg Lamp lights to hang on your Xmas tree.

For those of you living under a rock and unfamiliar with this film, it's about a little boy named Ralphie and what he wants for Christmas. The cast is fantastic and it's hilarious without being raunchy. This is how comedies used to be and some would argue should be. No doubt this film is great, but what most people don't know is that there is actually a sequel, with the same narrator, made 11 years later. My Summer Story follows Ralphie and his family the following summer and while the cast is different, the story is equally as good. I'd suggest you check out both films and be careful not to shoot your eye out kid!",1361577600,,808,4.357615894039735

The misguided enthusiasm of the dad, the vulnerabiliy of Ralphie, the deserate need of the older brother for the chistmas present and all the fantasising of how to accomplish getting it.

Given the option to rent or buy this classic, I didn't hesitate to purchase the rights to view this video from then on for years to come. It turns out that it might be more of a man's idea of traditional Christmas fare, as my wife was less than enthusiastic after experiencing the narrators recalling of a crude and boyish Christmas.

In the 2nd one, the boys are all teenagers, planning on getting their drivers' licenses & with their eyes on 'cars' (aka junk mobiles that need a lot of work, but they're cheap to buy). Ralphie (yes, he is still called that at times!) also has a major crush on the star quarterback's girlfiend (watch out, here come the dream sequences). In order to earn money (not going to say why; don't want to give it all away), Ralph & Co. get jobs at--where else--HIGBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE! Yes, the same place where Santa pushed Ralphie down the slide with his boot & yes, at some point, the guys become Santa's elves. Fun movie to watch (the Old Man is still dealing with the blasted furnace) & has a great surprise ending, but as usual, the original is better than the first. For those who want more of 'Ralphie,' there is a summer vacation version with Charles Grodin as 'The Old Man' & Mary Steenburgen as he mother. The movie is ""My Summer Story."" It's set after the original 'A Christmas Story' & can be a fun diversion. I recommend this double edition set, plus ""My Summer Story."" For all Peter Billingsley fans, he is also a producer & director as well as an actor now. He played the elf checking on how many Etch-A-Sketch toys that Buddy made in ""Elf."" He is also the airline ticket agent at the who tells Vince Vaughn's & Reese Witherspoon's characters that their flight to Australia/New Zealand is grounded (& there are no other flights available) in ""Four Christmases.""

The picture quality on the downloads is generally good & audio quality is quite good as well.  As with most downloads though, occasionally the video would get pixelized & almost come to a complete stop but it would only be for a couple of seconds.

Being a child of the early 50's I can relate to Ralphie, in fact, he could easily have been one of my pals . . . I take it from his review that Roger felt the same way.  I will be watching it again--it's nostalgic and funny.  I don't know if the current generation of young people will ""get it"" when watching the movie but as a window on the 50's it speaks volumes.

We have 12 Mbs DSL and have no trouble streaming except with Amazon via PS3. All other streaming works fine with the PS3.

She shrugged and said, ""It's pretty mild swearing, isn't it?""  I've heard some oxymorons in my life (ex. military intelligence), but that one took the cake!
If you can get past the variety of black and blue words, then there's the ""lamp"" which the boy refers to as ""electric sex.""  Again - in a children's movie?
I'm just glad I never intentionally set aside time to waste on this movie.  It's a cute enough idea; I even enjoyed the ""narration"" feel of having an adult male do voice-overs of thoughts and memories as if the story is told in retrospect.

Yes, of course.  I remember seeing this when I was a child, and although the world is a different place now, it is still quite easy to relate to the base themes.  It was brilliant to set this movie in a time other than 1983--the result is it ""feels"" fresher and without fad, just good old Christmas traditions intermixed with childhood angst, wonder, and surprise.

410476,5,6301966554,"I had heard about this movie years ago and always dismissed it.  I mean, a kid wanting a BB gun for Christmas?  I just credited the enthusiasts as having very different tastes in Christmas movies.  But, thought I'd  check it out on TCM one year and was truly amazed.  One does need a break from the sentimental and musical ones now and again.

As soon as I saw Ralphie's imaginary scene with Mom and Dad and little Randy huddled under the kitchen table, while he, dressed to the cowboy nines, ran off the ruffians, I was hooked.  It's just one funny scene after another, with hilarious sides running through, like Dad and the Bumpus dogs and his bouts with the furnace.  Ah, Mom was a good one, covering for the guys, but strict when it counts!  Yes.  Get the soap!  Of course, she really missed it on old Aunt so-and-so's Christmas gift - big time there.  Dad could be a bit scatty, but boy, did he come through.  And it was the best-wrapped gift, no doubt store done.  A class act there.  But the all-in-all for me was the absolutely side-splitting visit to that unbelievably grinched Santa, not to mention his imps - I mean, elves.  His Ho-Ho-Ho drew convulsive heaves, near tears, along with Ralphie's dazed expression, ending with a boot in the face down the slide.  Oh my gosh - hysterical.  And with all of that, it recalls oh-so-true-to-life common events and has a touching side as well.  Loaded with ho-ho's with absolutely NO ho-hums.

410479,5,6301966554,"Every man, woman and child needs to watch this.  It covers aspects of our childhoods from department store Santas to getting beaten up as a kid and finally coming unglued and beating up the bully, from Dad going overboard as we dads do and Mom trying to keep the peace as moms do, to the agony of hinting and hoping for that favorite Christmas present.  It answers the age old question of what happens when one touches the flag pole with one's tongue in the winter.  It even teaches you a ready-made warning for use when someone you care about wants to do something dangerous.

Watch this movie.",1355356800,,595,4.481481481481482

410481,5,6301966554,"When this movie first appeared it received very little notice. Probably Melinda Dillon was the closest thing to a star. It quickly became a nostalgic favorite. Every thing fit together so well: The kid trying to convince his parents he needed the Red Ryder rifle to defend them against the bad guys, the bursting with pride father (Darren McGavin in his best role) over luckily (?) winning the table lamp he put in the window so the neighbors could see, the quiet mother who was so ashamed to have anyone see the lamp and who accidentally - of course - broke the lamp, the younger brother who had to take the double dare to touch the frozen light pole with his tongue.

In my opinion, A Christmas Story perfectly captures the perspective of Christmas from the average child with hilarious results. And the ""true stories"" from the screenwriter's childhood have become classic gags. The leg lamp, the evil mall Santa, getting caught saying the F word by parents, the Bumpus' dogs, and sticking your toungue to a frozen pole are such classic material that I still laugh each time I see them to this day.

On the video quality front, the BluRay is just okay. It's certainly the best this film has ever looked on home video, but you won't find anything crazy-go-nuts in terms of visual quality.

Not only are the Christmas scenes great for this time of year, but the whole mood of small-town America around the early 1940s will take you back to a time where family was important and people went out in public instead of watching TV at night.

This had become something of an annual tradition over the  preceeding years, and consisted of he and I chowing down on her wonderful cooking ( done in the biggest microwave cooker I've ever seen) and then taking her to see the movie of her choice.

As might be imagined neither of us were too thrilled at the prospect of watching a cute bright eyed kid in a Christmas adventure, but, well, It was Momma's choice so we had to go without complaint, and, anyway, Darren McGavin was in it, so it couldn't be ALL bad.

The opening credits rolled and the action started.  We heard the narrator describe the bacchanilia of greed, a voice that had come to us from over the airwaves of Fun City to the wilderness of northwestern New Jersey.  A voice that had spoken to us of Concrete Mexicans and other glories of slob culture.  It was SHEPHERD!  I had read the book!

Ralphie and his quest to get a red ryder BB gun is the entire premise for this movie. Everyone is telling him he'll shoot his eye out if he had one. So he decides to ask Santa for it. His crazy father offers alot of humor as well. Plus, Ralphie and his friends have to deal with the neighborhood bully, Scudfarcus. It would be impossible to watch this and not want to watch it over and over. It brings such a smile on my face whenever I see it or think about it.",1354492800,,596,4.191304347826087

410823,4,6301966554,"With all of the fondness I've read for this movie I was surprised that it's mainly an American thing. I've never seen A Christmas Story on TV or in stores in the UK. I doubt many people outside of the US know who Jean Shepherd is, or of his popular Ralphie Parker character. In fact, most people in general won't know that this movie is actually the fourth of (currently) seven featuring Ralphie.

Adapted from the book In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash, a collection of mostly Christmas-themed short stories, it remind me a lot of Christmas Vacation (adapted by John Hughes from his own Christmas '59 short story) in that it seems semi-autobiographic. But the adaptation of several stories gives the movie a sketchy feel, with a few that failed to resonate with me.

The main story has little Ralphie Parker (brilliantly played by Peter Billingsly), a kid with imagination and cynicism beyond his years, beg his parents, and Santa, for a BB gun while dealing with a series of eccentric events in 1940s Indiana. It made me laugh quite a lot, but mainly in the second half. The cosy Xmas atmosphere is lovely, and there's not a shred of anything unwholesome. But I just can't see myself making this an annual tradition.

I am sure many will disagree, but it does make me curious about checking out the other Ralphie Parker movies.

The Blu-ray features a fine 1.78:1 1080p picture which accurately exhibits the film's retro color pallet and style. The sound is non-HD Dolby Mono, but it too matches the period setting. There are plenty of decent extras too. This Collector's Edition comes in a big tin box with a string of Xmas lights inside. The DVD counterpart contained an apron, cookie cutters, and a 50-page recipe book. I would much rather have had that than Xmas lights.",1354406400,,1779,4.674121405750799

410851,4,6301966554,"A Christmas Story is one of those movies that was under appreciated when it was first released but has become a holiday classic.

Young Ralphie Parker wishes for nothing but a ""Red Ryder carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing which tells time"" (a sundial) for Christmas. But it seems that at every turn, adults are standing between Ralphie and his BB gun with the constant admonition of ""you'll shoot your eye out."" A Christmas Story recounts the various misadventures of a young boy on a quest for Santa to bring him the best Christmas present ever, while trying to stay out of trouble, staying out of the way of the neighborhood bully, and avoiding the consequences of ""triple dog dares.""

A Christmas Story is narrated by author Jean Shepherd as the adult Ralphie. Shepherd's vivid narration is one of the defining elements of this movie. This movie will entertain the kids and remind adults of their own childhood Christmas stories.

A Christmas Story is rated PG for language and some rude humor. Most of the language is self-censored (in scenes where ""the Old Man"" goes into a profanity riddled tirade, the words are all gibberish.) There are only a couple of times that a single obscenity isn't self censored, and even then, it isn't any stronger than anything you would hear on prime-time network television.

410958,5,6301966554,"I've heard so much about A CHRISTMAS STORY through the years that I knew it was time to see this film. I've seen the Christmas items--the Leg Lamp and Ralphie dressed as a bunny so now it was time to see what it all meant.
A plus to me was having Darren McGavin as the father. McGavin has been a favorite actor of mine since the KOLCHAK TV series.
A CHRISTMAS STORY seemed to be off to a slow start author Jean Shepherd's narration was a bit annoying at first. It reminded me of THE WALTONS. But quickly, the pieces fell into place and it was evident as to what a delightful heartwarming film this is and why it should be an annual Christmas tradition for anyone.
The Parker family is a quirky but loveable bunch. Darren McGavin stars as the father or ""the old man"" as he is affectionately called. Melinda Dillon is the mother. The old man seems quite a bit older than mother. Ralphie is the older son and Randy is the ""baby"" of the family.
This Christmas season, Ralphie is obsessed with getting a Red Ryder B.B. gun from Santa and it is his goal to make it happen. The constant ""You'll shoot your eye out"" doesn't deter him in his quest.
Here is a very sweet return to a kinder and gentler time when Christmas was a magical event filled with Santa Claus and holiday cheer. We didn't take ourselves so seriously in the 1940's. Adults who grew up in the 40's - 60's might relate to these special Christmases involving Santa at the Department Store and finding the ""perfect"" live Christmas tree.
""The old man"" comes across as a bit of a curmudgeon but underneath he is a softie who loves his wife and sons. It was an era when the man had to seem tough and he ruled the house, or so he thought. Mother was the glue that held everyone together and she could soothe both husband and sons. The Parkers were a more realistic version of the perfect family.
Ian Petrella as Randy, the younger brother, is a real scene stealer as the kid who idolizes his older brother. As the ""baby"", he is bundled up to look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow man barely able to move or keep up with his brother and friends on their way to school. Every day, they are chased by the local bullies and every day they take the same route to school to pass the bullies. Yep, there were bullies even back then.
This film is filled with so many memorable moments. How about the leg lamp or the tongue frozen to a pole? What about a ruined Christmas dinner being saved by a meal in a Chinese restaurant. Maybe the Chinese staff trying to sing FLA LA LA LA LA becoming fra ra ra ra ra would be politically incorrect today but there is a sweetness to the scene. The staff is trying its best to make a happy and memorable Christmas for the disappointed family and guess what, they save Christmas for the Parker Family.
A CHRISTMAS STORY is so sweet and so gentle on so many levels. If only, we could take a step back into time when Christmas had a meaning and families were together.",1353974400,,2945,4.298561151079137

410960,5,6301966554,"This is a great movie for people of all ages, even though this movie took place many years ago, 1940's setting, I think kids will enjoy this.

With it's classic one liner's and moments of comical relief, all mixed in with a christmas wish for a red ryder bb gun, What better a movie to watch every holiday season. When you have TBS playing it all day on their 24 hour marathon on Christmas Eve and Christmas day, It is really hard to miss when you're flipping the channels. When the film came out, it did not do very well at the box office. Over the years it would gain more acclaim as one of the most beloved Christmas movies of all time. Now that they released a crappy sequel with Home Alone's Marv as the old man, I feel sad that Hollywood had to take the glory of the original and nibble some of it away as they do with a lot of classic Christmas film's these days. Example: Home Alone 3+4. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the original because really there is no other Christmas film That holds the bar higher than this one. Except maybe It's a Wonderful life directed by Frank Capra. I have not seen it but have heard great reviews. Well, hope you guys are doing just fine and great. Happy Holidays.

The whole movie is great, but my two favorite scenes are the scene with the lamp and the bunny costume.  I can understand why Ralph would not want to wear something like that.

411323,5,6301966554,"""A Christmas Story"" takes me back to when I was a young boy.  We walked to Central Grade School in several feet of snow in the winter.  There were no school busses to keep us warm and toasty.  Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block.  A Christmas gift of a Daisy air rifle was a boy's passage to becoming a responsible young man.  We didn't shoot at one another or damage anybody's property because we knew when we went home that evening the ""Old Man"" would find out from a neighbor.  Then I would certainly get a spanking and would loose my privilege of playing with my shiny new Daisy air rifle.  This time in Americana was the best time for children to learn and live the values which produced the ""Greatest Generation"" who built the American dream.  The neighborhoods were safe for children to play outside and have snowball battles and sled ride down ""Suicide Hill.""  The modern world with both parents working and children being housed in daycare, or raised by a village, has created a tear in the fabric of the family.  I really feel sorry for the children of today because they have not lived ""A Christmas Story.""  That's such a shame....

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Kind regards,

411325,5,6301966554,"Loved it! My favorite Christmas movie. Hilarious from beginning to end. Happy,upbeat feeling throughout. A lot of vintage things. If you're a baby boomer you might relate to the Christmas tree that's a real cedar tree,the long strands of silver tinsel that used to come in rectangular boxes,and the big Christmas lights. That and the father's ongoing war with his coal furnace.
I strongly recommend ""A Christmas Story"" for anyone of any faith,or none,and anyone of any age. It's rated PG.When Ralphie says ""The mother of all dirty words"" you don't technically hear him say it. It's great fun about a real family. The whole movie is syrup-free. There's no pushing any religion,no trying to sell the idea that everyone else has a Hallmark Christmas, no rubbing peoples' noses in it if they don't have a perfect family and house,OR if they aren't getting engaged to a prince or princess on Christmas.
It does,however have snow,Christmas lights,vintage toys,and much about what it's like being a child at Christmas. If you were lucky enough to have had some good winter holidays,as a child,this movie takes you right back and puts you in the situation again. It all comes back to you. If your childhood holidays left you with not-good memories then,as the saying goes,""It's never too late to have a happy childhood.""This movie will finally put you in the situation of having a happy childhood at Christmastime.

Over the years I have seen it a number of times and the film has clearly grown on me.  It shows the personal reflections of a young boy dealing with the mundane things young boys face.  Some of the scenes show just how ridiculous events and people (both young and old) can be.  The film has sparked a cult following that has grown to proportions that the famous leg lamp is now manufactured and available for anyone who has the desire (?) for such a thing.

411479,5,6301966554,"There is a moment in A CHRISTMAS STORY that you don't hear much about in movie reviews, but it's one of the many scenes that demonstrate how funny the film really is. Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) had just uttered the ""F--- word"". Mother (Melinda Dillon) literally does the one thing every mother threatens to do when a child uses such language. Now, she demands to know where Ralphie heard that word. We hear Ralphie's narration explain where he heard it. My own father completely came apart with laughter at that explanation. I had never heard the man laugh so hard in my life. I laughed out loud, too. And every time I see the movie it always gets a laugh out of me and my friends.

That's one of the laughs to come out of A CHRISTMAS STORY. For my father, it reminded him of the time when he was just 9 years old. He grew up in Southern California in the 1940's and recognized a lot of the elements depicted in the movie. He owned a Daisy Red Rider air rifle. And yes, his mother uttered the phrase, ""you'll shoot your eye out"". Ralphie and his brother Randy (Ian Patrilla), listen to ""Little Orphan Annie"" on the radio, sponsored by Ovaltine. Ralphie orders and receives a decoder pin. And my father told me all of that was true for him at that time. If I remember correctly, he said the teacher in A CHRISTMAS STORY dressed exactly like his grade-school teachers did. Attention to detail was clearly paid in making this movie.

There are other really funny scenes in A CHRISTMAS STORY. The Old Man (Darren McGavin) wins a contest and it's a lamp in the shape of a leg. He puts it right in the front window. Mother tries to be polite. This is all the setup. The payoff is in what happens to the lamp: she accidentally breaks it, and confesses her actual opinion on that lamp. When the old man tries to put it back together, watch her in the background. Another great scene is what happens when Ralphie tries to plead with Santa after his mother and teacher told him the same thing. This is one really terrifying Santa Clause, and what he does to Ralphie is funny and not surprising. And finally, there are the fantasies Ralphie has about defending the family home, getting special recognition after his teacher reads his theme, and what would happen if he was struck blind.

A CHRISTMAS STORY got very good reviews in the winter of 1983, and did okay at the box office. After it came out on video it became a big sensation. Then, TNT began doing A CHRISTMAS STORY marathons every Christmas Eve. Like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS CAROL, it has become an annual ritual for families to watch every year. It deserves to be called an American classic today. Peter Billingsley is now in his forties and a highly regarded film producer (he has worked with Vince Vaughn and Jon Favrau for the past ten years.) And yet, nearly thirty years after A CHRISTMAS STORY came out, people talk to him about it. Before he did this movie I knew him as ""Messy Marvin"" in the Hershey chocolate syrup commercials. They were really funny. He didn't really act in anything memorable afterwards, but he demonstrated acting talent in this movie.",1326585600,2,3131,4.508802816901408

Maybe I wish my family was like that, and it kinda makes you feel what it was like when Christmas actually WAS Christmas. It is not about gifts, ipods, iPads, computers, technology, or any of that garbage that means nothing. Its a story about a family from a kids perspective when all he really wanted was 1 simple gift, and his quest to get there. The writing is great, and its just a fun movie to watch. It has it all.

But you can still get a Red Ryder BB Rifle @ your local Big Box Store...  Not to mention Amazon!  It's all about reliving those golden years of childhood, with the highs and lows that often followed one another quite closely.

411668,5,6301966554,"Based on the highly nostalgic ""Ralphie"" stories of master humorist Jean Shepherd, ""A Christmas Story"" takes us to Holman, Indiana in the year 1940 to tell the tale of one little boy's seemingly hopeless quest to get a Red Ryder B.B. gun for Christmas. Young Ralph Parker plots tirelessly against the persistent warnings from mother, teacher, and even a nasty store Santa Claus that he'll surely just shoot his eye out! It's not a complicated plot and is full of episodic little incidents, but every moment is thoroughly enjoyable. The combination of nostalgic, relatable situations and characters and a perfectly selected cast of talents (including Kolchak the Nightstaker himself, Darren McGavin, as the Old Man), not to mention Jean Shepherd's pure brilliance (including his genius as a narrator, which he does for all the Ralphie films), make this film a true cinematic treasure. If the fact that it is one of MY favorite movies of all time isn't enough to convince you to check this one out, how about this: It is so beloved that, for years, it has been run in a 24 hour loop on cable on Christmas Eve/Day to consistently be viewed by millions of joyful fans. This low-budget (you could hardly tell), 1983 masterpiece has become a true classic and genuine phenomenon resulting in a flood of merchandise in recent years (yes, I have the action figures) as well as making the Parker family home a legitimate tourist attraction.

Here, it is made available on Blu-Ray for the second time with a small assortment of extras ported over from its initial Blu-Ray release, as well as the same transfer which many were not pleased with. Personally, as someone who only owned the original DVD release before this, I'm just thrilled to have it in widescreen finally. Though, I'm disappointed to find that not all the bonus features from the previous, 20th Anniversary Blu-Ray are included on this one, especially the Jean Shepherd audio material. What we do have here is a ""documentary"" that is quite enjoyable, though it is no ""making-of"" by any means. It is really just a collection of ""looking back"" interviews with the child stars and late director Bob Clark. Also, we get an excellent audio commentary with Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie). Funnily enough, just like many of the film's fans, they are not sure what year the film is set in themselves, even though you can find the year ""1940"" very clearly visible if you look in the right place (on Ralphie's decoder pin that he receives in the mail). Other bonus features include the theatrical trailer, a brief featurette on Red Ryder B.B. guns, some script pages of two deleted fantasy sequences, and a commercial for leg lamp replicas you can actually purchase. There's also a cheesy featurette called ""Get a Leg Up"", which is essentially an infomercial for the leg lamps being sold by the aforementioned commercial. I wouldn't mind getting one of these leg lamp replicas myself, but I could do without TWO commercials for them on this disc. Overall, some of the bonus features are very good, but there is a lot of missed opportunity, and why drop bonuses from the previous edition? That's a practice I'll never understand! I say get this if you don't own the movie yet, or if you only own fullscreen versions. This Blu-Ray is okay, but the movie itself is a must own. I do wish I'd gotten the previous Blu-Ray release though (with the red cover). I bought this one (white cover) somewhat blindly, because I found it at a great price and had promised myself I would finally upgrade this year from the fullscreen DVD.

Now, before I end this, I want to recommend all those who find they love this film to look into the other 5 Ralphie films. Yes, 5! In fact, 3 of them predate ""A Christmas Story"". First, there was ""The Phantom of the Open Hearth"", which told of teenage Ralphie's prom experience, not to mention giving us the first screen depiction of the leg lamp story. That was in 1976. Then, in 1978, ""The Great American 4th of July and Other Disasters"", which is a true favorite of mine and stars a young Matt Damon as Ralph, again a teenager in a real Ralphie-style 4th of July must-view celebration. The blind date bit is priceless! Then, in 1983, there was ""The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski"" (okay, admittedly, not sure if this one came out before or after A Christmas Story). Again, we see Ralph as a teen in this one, when he finds his first love in the Polish girl who moves in next door after the hillbilly Bumpuses move out. Technically, this is Ralphie's Thanksgiving story, and it's very fun and funny . All three of those were television films made for PBS's American Playhouse, as was the next Ralphie film, showing a bit of influence from ""A Christmas Story"" this time, as here Ralph is a little younger. The film is 1988's ""Ollie Hopnoodle's Haven of Bliss"", and it tells about Ralph's first job, the family's lost dog, and the big, annual, family road trip. Finally, we have the most direct sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", the big screen release from Christmas Story director Bob Clark, ""My Summer Story"", which is set the summer after Ralphie received his Red Ryder blue-steel beauty. This little noticed 1994 film, like all the others, stars a mostly different cast (Charles Grodin is the Old Man here, and Mary Steenburgen is Mom, with Kieran Culkin as Ralph), and tells the tales of Ralph's summer quest for the ultimate fighting top, mom's gravy boat incident, fishing with the Old Man, and a trip to the World's Fair. ""My Summer Story"" is also sometimes called ""It Runs in the Family"", but it's not the only film that has used that title. Bottom line, if you love ""A Christmas Story"" for all of it's great qualities beyond the Christmas stuff, then you will likely enjoy all the other Ralphie films too. All are fine films with great, nostalgic stories and casts, and all are narrated by the late, great Jean Shepherd. I recommend them all! Though, you'll have to be net savvy to get the PBS films. My Summer Story, happily, IS available on DVD, and Ollie Hopnoodle's did get a VHS release. Incidentally, I first saw all these films on the Disney Channel back when that channel was seriously good. Some of you may remember that as well. Happy hunting!

Update: You may or may not have heard about the soon to be release ""A Christmas Story 2"", coming direct to DVD. It's toting itself as the ""Official"" sequel to ""A Christmas Story"", as if this one was not. Well, you can watch the trailer online already, and it is really... something. Amazingly, they have done a great job capturing the look of the first (better than My Summer Story did, sadly). Tragically, the acting and lines do not impress (and why does Ralph look like a dummy this time around?). Of course, it looks like they are just trying to do a lot of copying and referencing to the first, too. Okay, sure, this was a bad idea from the start. Shepherd and Clark are deceased (who in the world is narrating this, I wonder?), and the cast is all new, and the writing is clearly contrived, direct to video sequel kinda stuff. Still, when I see the production values and the way they managed to capture the look of ""A Christmas Story"" in the trailer, I do wish they had somehow found a great writer and great actors for it. Oh well. We shall see how it goes. I mean, how can I NOT see it?",1320883200,11,7352,4.640828856485035

Anyone who waited anxiously behind their davenport for just a glance; for anyone who believed in the magic of this mystery man;
for anyone who had that special one of a kind gift that no one and I mean no one would get for you - this leads us into the magical world of MGM's A Christmas Story.
Ralphie in his lust for a Red Ryder BB Gun - ""You'll shot your eye out"" parent/adult response and the length our Ralphie goes to achieve his conquest is worth the nearly 2 hours of video viewing.
A very strong cast keeps this fast paced action comedy adventure true to the written word.
Admit it, we all recognize and know our own Ralphie and gang. Parents who are loving; Teachers who are so focused that they miss the BIG PICTURE here. And last how could any review fail to mention Raplhie's imaginary world which springs to life with just the right amount a suggestion.
A all time holiday classic worth the watch. So good a feature one station plays the film non-stop for 24 hours over the Christmas holiday and in my house, we have it on every set until the marathon is over. Watch for glimpses of such 1939 stories as The Wizard of Oz and Mickey Mouse.

411972,5,6301966554,"So many people have written about A Christmas Story that it's difficult to come up with anything novel to say. I remember seeing it for the first time when I was in junior high school and the other kids were saying ""You'll shoot your eye out."" Over the years, I've watched it as my life has changed. But A Christmas Story has always retained its charm.

I think that A Christmas Story is not so much about Christmas as it usually works out for most of us. Like most ""holiday classics,"" it's about the Christmas that we always hope that we will have. For those who first watched the film in the 1980s, it evoked nostalgia for a seemingly-simpler time. A Christmas Story celebrates family, friendship, decency, triumph over adversity, and not taking oneself too seriously. It probably goes without saying that this is a ""sweet"" movie.

The only things that I dislike about this film are the sequences in which Ralphie fantasizes. Those segments just don't do much for me.

A majority of this country's population have seen this film, and I'm sure all of them now love it right after they've watched it (well, ALMOST all of them, now that I've seen the current reviews here on Amazon). I should be included on the list of those who love it. I mean, this is a definite classic. It's both hilarious and touching at the same time. Along with It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone, every single minute of this film is almost flawless. It's also one of those films in which you can memorize much of the dialogue, not to mention the many sight gags (tongue on frozen pole, anyone?). I think my favorite scenes are the ones involving soap and lamps . . . I won't give out any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet. Speaking of which, if you haven't seen this Christmas classic just yet, give it a shot, especially on Christmas Eve.

411984,5,6301966554,"As I've grown in maturity, my tastes have changed in many respects.  For most of my adult life my favorite Christmas story has been Charles Dickens classic scenario ""A Christmas Carol"" written in 1843 and which still remains as one of my favorite Christmas classics.  In fact the movie rendition by Alastair Sim is indeed a Christmas ritual to be seen by all.  With the last 20 years I've changed my mind as to the ultimate ""Christmas Story"".
 Up front, I must confess that this classic movie was indeed shot and is deeply ensconced into the very fabric of Cleveland culture.  The very house in the movie scenes is now a museum on the near west side of Cleveland.  The very mention of ""The Higbee Company"" issues the very essence of ""A Christmas Story"".  When these scenes were shot in January of 1983, I remember the cold sweeping winds coming off Lake Erie putting Northeast Ohio in a deep freeze.
 The story itself remains a classic in American culture.  Set in the fictional city of Hohman, Indiana all the dreams and culture of pre-World War II America presents itself.  In fact from a historical point of view the Depression was in fact over and America, not at war, was in the beginnings of unprecedented prosperity.  The actual beginning of life in America as it should be.  In fact Ralphie experienced life on the upswing.
 The fact of this pre-adolescent receiving a treasured Christmas present shows the rise of the middle class which has gone unabated since.  The Christmas morning scene in which the ""Old Man"" stated that he got a BB gun at Ralphie's age shows the end of the depression and the start of the ""good times"".  However as we watch this movie we can see that discipline 7 decades ago was very real.  Life was indeed more structured and disciplined.  The family not only ate their evening meals together, they also ate their breakfasts as a family unit.  Expectations were tempered and hoped for.  Life was easier but held more accountable.  Life was simple and fraught with troubles but in the end, life had meaning and purpose.
 This story shows us a piece of Americana never to be seen again.  Family life as shown in this movie no longer exists which to me represents the sad passing of an institution which is in desperate need in our 21st century way of life.  It's really no wonder why this story runs a 24 hour Christmas marathon each year.  This is the big screen equivalent of a Norman Rockwell painting representing what American life was.",1257638400,2,2473,4.632183908045977

The characters are unappealing; the situations are unoriginal; the ""jokes"" that are tortured out of Darren McGavin are as funny as a crystal bowl shattered on one's bare foot; and the plot makes hardly any sense. Where the film endeavors to elicit humor--such as in the final Chinese restaurant scene--I find myself shaking my head, considering and reconsidering precisely whence I'm supposed to derive the giggles. And please tell me why it is the least bit funny to have a young boy solidly stuck by the tongue to an ice-cold metal flagpole!

Santa and his elves at the department store are positively horrid. The only bright light is Peter Billingsley, starring as the older son. He is charming in his single-minded quest for a Red Ryder beebee gun for Christmas.

412200,5,6301966554,"I was almost finished recording ""A Christmas Story"" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.

That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.

Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""

As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.

Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.

Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.

And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others.

Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.

""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...",1229990400,2,2998,4.774131274131274

412232,5,6301966554,"""A Christmas Story"" is one of those classics that you feel, needs to be watched every Holiday season.  I can remember watching this film a jillion times as a child and now having the opportunity to share the film with my kids.

Despite being a low-budget film at that time, what made this film become a classic is that, it's a Christmas story of an American family in the 1940's.  Ralphie is a child who listens to Orphan Annie on the radio, reads comic books and wants a Red Ryder Air Gun for Christmas.

But of course, how can he convince his parents to buy him one when his mother thinks he'll shoot his eye out.  So, you get to see how Ralphie tries to get the gun by trying to get a good grade on his school report, to planting an ad in his mother's favorite magazine and even going to the mall and talking to Santa.

But the magical part of this film are its characters.  Every character from Ralphie's family to his friends, everything comes together quite well.  From his father who wins an award which is a leg (in fishnet stockings) lamp, his friends being bullied by Scotty Farkus, his brother who is overly dressed in his snowsuit, his friend sticking his tongue on a pole to see if it would get stuck and much more.

So, back in 2003, this film received a 20th Anniversary DVD treatment and in 2006, was followed up by its first Blu-ray release.  Then sure enough, with the 25th Anniversary Ultimate Edition which had a special bundled edition in which people could own a miniature version of the leg lamp (ala string leg lamp lights for the Christmas tree) and the film on Blu-ray or get a version without the lamps.

There is no difference with the 2008 Blu-ray version versus the 2006 version.

VIDEO:

The video is featured in 1080p High Definition/169, 1:85:1.  The Blu-ray is marginally better than the DVD version.  But you can notice the quality of it's clearness via Blu-ray.  You'll have parts on the film which look soft and nicks and scratches from the film.  But I compared my old VHS version to the Blu-ray and oh my, the Blu-ray is light years ahead of it in quality.  For an older film, having been remastered already, I don't really think we are going to get anything better than what we have on Blu-ray.  But it still looks good.

AUDIO:

The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0 in English and French.  I doubt we will see a TrueHD for this and since it's mostly dialogue and because of its time setting and how old this film is, I suppose I'm not too bothered by this.  It's one of those films that I'm not begging for surround sound.  So, I'm actually OK with it being 1.0.

I've owned the first DVD version which had nothing in terms of special features, I didn't own the 20th Anniversary but as for this Blu-ray it includes:

  * Commentary by Peter Billingsley and Director/Co-Writer Bob Clark - This commentary was actually quite fun to listen to.  You get a lot of Billingsley asking questions to Bob Clark about certain scenes, working with different individuals and also talking about the film and its reception from viewers in the last 20 years.  His relationship with working with Jean Shepard and much more.  There are some times where they are watching the film and don't say anything but I think both were pretty much rewatching the film for its entirety probably in a long time.  One scene I wondered about was the parade which featured Mickey Mouse.  I always wondered how Mickey could show up on an MGM film and sure enough Clark explains how Disney allowed it.
  * 20th Anniversary Documentary ""Another Christmas Story"" - This documentary features Bob Clark, Peter Billingsley and the guys who play his two buddies and the guy who plays Farkus.  Each talking about their experiences, the pole and tongue scene and how people react to them to this day and how people have memorized the lines.  And learning how a lot of detergent was used to re-create some of those snow scenes.
  * Daisy Red Ryder - This was an interesting featurette on the actual Daisy Red Ryder Air Rifle.  How it was created for the film and the actual company who produces air guns.
  * Get a Leg Up - This one is a infomercial like featurette of the leg lamp.  Nothing major.
  * Script Pages - This features the script of actual scenes that were cut.  Clark talks about several scenes that they didn't use in the film.  I wish they still had that and offered the videos as a deleted scene (especially the Ralphie/Flash Gordon scenes) but you can read the script of what was cut.
  * Trailer - And looking at the trailer, it looks so old in terms of picture quality after watching it on Blu-ray.

For me, ""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" is like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and even ""Home Alone"".  Films that are Christmas classics that you just want to watch with the family during the holidays.

""A CHRISTMAS STORY"" has been a part of so many families holiday's within the last 20 years and remains one of the classics next to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" (and other classics) shown every year and watched by many.  It's a true-to-heart tale and the way it's written, it's not fluffy, it's the life of a young boy who wants a Christmas present but his parents are not exactly ""Brady Bunch"", magical parents.  Blue collar father with a temper, mother who does her best to take care of the kids and a time in the 1940's of decoder rings and Ovaltine.

If you own the 20th Anniversary DVD, really...you don't need to buy this.  But if you are like me and you own the first DVD version with no special features or the VHS version, then yeah, moving up to Blu-ray is a great decision.  It's marginally better in picture quality than the DVD and you get all the special features as well.

Overall, it's a Christmas classic worth owning.",1229126400,5,5772,4.48895292987512
412233,5,6301966554,"I am an absolute fan of A Christmas Story and was so excited to see this set together. There was only one thing that I was disappointed about was not getting the leg lamp lights with it. I wanted all of it (the apron, cookbook, cookie cutters, dvd) including the lights. The only way to get that with this anniversary set is to buy the blu-ray version but all you get in it are the lights. I ended up buying the lights on a different web site.",1229040000,,443,4.103448275862069

I did snicker at two lines in the movie, and it was interesting to go back to the times when kids sat around the radio with decoder pins as their form of entertainment.  But those three times I just mentioned, well that took up about 1 minute of the whole movie.  The rest was depressing and torturous.  I agree with the person who said they should have made it that he wanted the BB gun for his birthday, this way you could leave out the whole Christmas aspect, since the whole tone clashed with the spirit of Christmas anyway.  If you want to see a movie that is a bit twisted/cynical, yet has the redeeming powers of Christmas, get Chevy Chase Christmas Vacation.

412270,3,6301966554,"So many people cited this as their very favorite Christmas movie, and I'd never seen it, so  I figured I should watch it.

Basically, it's about a boy in the 1940s who wants a BB gun for Christmas. It's set in the 1940s. Rather than a single, linear story, it's a series of scenes about their life in the 1940s. Did I mention that it's set in the 1940s? Argh. Obviously, the filmmakers spent a lot of time and money getting the setting just right, because they beat the audience over the head with it every chance they got. Drove me up a wall, in case you didn't notice.

It's also got the first-person voice-overs from grown-up Ralphie. If you watched The Wonder Years, it's like that. A grown-up navel-gazing about his childhood. It's almost as entertaining as listening to someone tell you about their dreams.

There were some amusing scenes, of course, and I even laughed aloud several times. And I really enjoyed the end. It was such a nice parent moment--that no matter how disappointing his own life was, he could still give that joy to his son.  Aww[...]

I'd guess it would be a more appealing movie if I had an idealized view of childhood or of the 1940s (it was set in the 1940s, by the way). Unfortunately, I have neither. Or if I liked Hollywood's version of a ""cute kid."" I have kids. Three of them. They're cute--or were, when they were younger. I tend to find Hollywood's version of cute obnoxious and whiny.

On the other hand, I can't agree with the (very few) negative reviews--almost all of which complained about either vulgarity or *gasp* a gun! for Christmas! *ack!*--either. It was the 1940s. Kids had guns. They had BB guns in the 1960s, too--well, the boys did, at least--I had to borrow my little brother's. And it's pretty obvious that vulgarity doesn't bother me--I give&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blazing-Saddles/dp/B0001Z4OXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blazing Saddles</a>&nbsp;5 stars.

412274,5,6301966554,"Revised 12/09:  The 2003 ""Anniversay"" edition of the DVD is now out of print, making this the only deluxe version of the movie available at the current time.  A year ago, there were two identical Christmas Story DVD sets on the market at the same time, and this was the more expensive of the two.  Seeing as how this is no longer and issue, I'm upping the score for this item from three stars to five.

Original review:
Don't get me wrong - I love ""A Christmas Story,"" and I would give the film a 5-star review.  The issue here is that the 2008 DVD release is EXACTLY the same as the 2003 version (aside from some slightly different artwork on the slipcover and case).  There are no new special features, and the print quality is the same as before.  There is absolutely no need for the studio to release this needless double dip DVD.  If you don't already own the 2003 version, then this is a must have DVD; if you do, there's no need to buy the new version, unless you go for the Ultimate Collector's Edition, which has some neat extras (which admittedly aren't worth the price if you already own the film on DVD).

Amazon clearly advertises the Blu-Ray comes with leg lamp lights and the DVD comes with cookie cutters, a cookbook, and apron.  For those of you who can't read, Amazon has even included pretty pictures and a video showing this.

I pre-ordered mine back in August, and it was delivered the day of release.  The green tin can was in perfect condition, as well were the lights.

If you care about getting the true theatrical version, wait until someone on here buys this edition and confirms whether or not the widescreen is what is promised. If it isn't, save your money and get a used copy.

412319,5,6301966554,"I was almost finished recording ""A Christmas Story"" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition soon.

That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half of my favorite holiday on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.

Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""

As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.

Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.

Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message about love and family and all that -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.

And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life with his slightly stressed-out delivery. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others. McGavin gets many of the best ones, though (""FRA-GEE-LAY... that must be Italian!"").

Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. He's never oversmart or annoying, ever. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.

This movie has seen a bunch of editions over the last few years, from a bare-bones full-screen edition to a full/widescreen edition with a second disc of goodies. From what I can tell, this is the latter -- easter eggs, trivia, documentary and featurettes about the movie, commentary from the lead actor and director, readings from Jean Shepherd, and so forth. Also a goofy new cover with... well, everything you love about this movie, from the bunny suit to the leg lamp to the BB gun.

""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...",1217376000,4,3714,4.790625
412322,5,6301966554,"This odd little film has become the parallel-universe ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of our time. It brings up memories that many people can identify with - wanting - with all your heart - a toy that will ""shoot your eye out"", facing up to the school bully and then getting punished for being violent rather than being commended for courage, and for those of you up north, sticking your tongue on a frozen pole and getting stuck to it. This actually happened to my brother-in-law as a kid.

However, Ralphie, the protagonist in our film, has a completely dysfunctional family. To be specific, he has a completely dysfunctional father. In the narration Ralphie never even calls him ""dad"" - he's just ""the old man"". ""The old man"" cares about nothing more than he cares for the tackiest of lamps that he received as an award that is made out of a mannequin's leg that he displays in a position of prominence in the living room. Ralphie's father is no George Bailey. If he got to see the world as it was if he never existed, no doubt the only noticeable difference would be that the tacky lamp would belong to someone else and Ralphie and his mother would be better off. The narration is wonderful as you see everything from a child's perspective, and if you remember your childhood at all, you can probably remember reasoning things out as Ralphie does. In Ralphie's world adults - including his parents - are the arbitrary givers of reward and punishment who all seem to be in odd and unreasoned alignment. These adults are mazes to be solved, not givers of lessons to be learned. However, as an adult, you'll see the humor in the situations too. Highly recommended.",1217030400,4,1657,4.597972972972973
412323,5,6301966554,"Amazon has combined the reviews for the Blu-ray and standard DVD versions of this set, which aren't exactly the same in their features.  This review is for the Blu-ray version.  My review of the standard DVD version is here too, so be sure you're reading the one you're interested in.

The movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).  Should you upgrade to the new Ultimate edition if you already have the 2006 Blu-ray edition?  That depends on how much you like memorabilia.  The new edition is a repackaging of the 2006 edition, with a couple new non-DVD extras:

-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)
-- a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights (Blu-ray exclusive)

Those look like fun, if you're into that kind of stuff.  Amazon has a photo of the tin and a second photo that shows the tin and the leg-lamp lights.  (The announcement for this set said that the items from the standard DVD set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B001CFEC7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>) would be included in this one, but that isn't correct.)

The Blu-ray DVD won't be remastered from the previous one.  The video quality of the 2006 release was only fair for hi-def, soft with fairly good color, with fair mono sound.

The 2006 Blu-ray didn't include everything that was on the HD or the 2-disc SD set.  Here's what's actually included:

-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)
-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast
-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp
-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history
-- original theatrical trailer

The features from earlier editions that aren't included are trivia and decoder games, readings (audio only) from Jean Shepherd, and an ad for the real leg lamp.

Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.

The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: ""You'll put your eye out!""  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.

The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.

This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.",1216166400,134,3810,5.059294871794871

The movie is excellent, a Christmas classic (see below).  Should you upgrade to the new Ultimate edition if you already have the 2003 2-disc Special Edition?  That depends on how much you like memorabilia.  The new edition is a repackaging of the 2003 edition, with a passel of new non-DVD extras.  Those include:

-- a collectible retro Christmas cookie tin (the container for the set)
-- 48-page cookbook with recipes inspired by the movie
-- photos and quotes from the movie
-- a red chef's apron with an A Christmas Story logo on it
-- 5 collectible cookie cutters ""in iconic Christmas Story shapes"" (looks like a star, a house, a leg lamp, Ralphie in his bunny suit, and what may be Peking Duck or a turkey)

Those look like fun, if you're into that kind of stuff.  (Click on Amazon's second thumbnail above for a photo.)

The DVDs won't be newly remastered, but are the same set as in 2003.  The video quality of the 2003 release is fairly good, a bit soft, with good mono sound.  It includes both the original 1.85:1 widescreen format (anamorphic) and full screen versions.

The DVD special features are also the same as before:

-- audio commentary by director/co-writer Bob Clark and star Peter Billingsley (Ralphie)
-- two readings by Jean Shepard, author and narrator for the movie (audio only)
-- Another Christmas Story featurette, includes interviews with Clark and a few members of the cast
-- Get a Leg Up featurette, about the making and ongoing sale of the (in)famous leg lamp
-- A History of the Daisy Red Ryder featurette, on the object of great desire's actual history
-- Triple Dog Dare Interactive Trivia
-- Decoder Match Challenge
-- easter eggs (including an actual ad for the leg lamp)
-- original theatrical trailer

There is a Blu-ray version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B001CFLGMS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>), with a different color cookie-tin container and a strand of leg-lamp Christmas lights.  (My review of that one is here too, if you want to see what the differences are.)

Now, about the really good stuff, the movie.  A Christmas Story is that odd film that appeals to a cross-section of viewers who often can't agree on what to watch.  Fans of sweet Christmas cheer are happily joined by people with a more jaundiced eye to the holiday.  To be sure, the movie leans more to the sweet than the sour, but it has enough edge and good-natured twistedness to please some of our darker Christmas angels too.  It conveys a genuinely warm nostalgia and some sharp, sometimes pretense-deflating observations about human nature.

The story is set at some indefinite time around 1940 in an Indiana town approaching the holidays.  Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants only one thing for Christmas, the Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action 200-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle with a compass in the stock.  (That is, a BB gun, a very particular one.)  He plans carefully well in advance how to lay the groundwork for this while avoiding the dreaded rebuff, but almost everyone says it anyway: ""You'll put your eye out!""  The relentless struggle for the one true gift develops alongside several other small stories and amusing details, a tongue-on-frozen-pole triple-dog dare, facing the local bully, the notorious leg lamp, the Santa slide, Peking Duck for Christmas, and several others, each memorable in itself.

The actors aren't very well known, but they're all just right.  There is narration throughout, representing an older Ralphie, done by the originator of the story, Jean Shepard, also just right.

This movie, made in 1983, has gradually become a favorite Christmas classic, now shown in an annual 24-hour Christmas marathon on cable, which attracts a huge number of viewers.  If you've never seen it, give it a try, even if you have a little Scrooge in you, and you'll probably enjoy it.",1215734400,34,4108,5.014749262536873

From the first time on VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray.  This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.  So how does this HD version stack up against all the others?  Very well if you must know.

For all of you familiar and unfamiliar with the story it takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's.  An America many people seem to remember fondly.  The story centers around a boy named Ralphy and his Christmas wish to have a Red Rider BB gun.  Of course the adults all seem to feel the gun is unsafe and you the repeated phrase, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Although this is really just a small part of the story.

Ralphy is like many boys of his age then and now.  On the cusp of adolescence while still having his childish tendencies.  During the movie you get to know his friends and all the people around him.  Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.  This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.

Now if you have not bought this movie on DVD it is a great value.  The picture is only mildly improved from it's DVD version.  Sometimes you will be wondering if it's really in HD.  Although despite that this is a great movie.  Christmas or not it is a classic.  The Blu-ray version comes with some extras like a anniversary follow up with a few of the child actors.

Never saw this as a kid, somehow. I liked it last week, though, and wished I had seen it as a boy so I could have used it to convince my folks to get me a bb gun!
My mom said ""You'll shoot your eye out"" pretty often too. It's a good line, one of the few I had no decent comeback to. ""I've got two"" never seemed very impressive. Fortunately I still do have both eyes, and they enjoyed this movie. It's well-written and moves along nicely. McGavin is exceptionally funny at times...the Night Stalker as family man.

I can't imagine how it could have been approved for release.
There is a considerable amount of ""wobble"" in the image, as if watching a well-worn VHS tape.

Hopefully the new 2007 release has corrected these issues.

I paid $5 or under for this one, and I regret it 99%.
*** Note that I do NOT HATE this film; I hate this terrible version that they released.

Aside from the dated, overly silly moments, this version has further sullied my memories of this film with it's horrid low-resolution cover art (which it appears they have essentially used again for the new 2007 version).
It almost put my eye out.",1196812800,5,706,4.4921875
412460,5,6301966554,"I was almost finished recording ""A Christmas Story"" on last Christmas morning. Fifteen minutes before it ended, my father walked in and said that we would get the special edition.

That I didn't go postal at losing an hour and a half on something that would shortly be redundant shows how much I love ""A Christmas Story."" This 1983 classic is not just a heartwarming little story about a loving (if bickery) family in the dour America of the late 1940s, but a hysterical comedy about what it's like to be a kid at Christmas.

Ralphie Parker's (Peter Billingsley) Christmas wishes are simple: a official Red Ryder, carbine action, two-hundred shot range model air rifle with a compass and a ""thing that tells time."" But his mom says he'll shoot his eye out. So Ralphie begins a quiet crusade to get it as a present -- he writes an essay on it and even asks Santa, only to get the same terrible reply: ""You'll shoot your eye out.""

As the days tick down to Christmas -- with no sign of an air rifle -- Ralphie hits other obstacles when he clashes with bullies, says ""the mother of all dirty words,"" and watches his parents battle it out over a tacky ""major award"" (leg lamp). But there are surprises in store for the Parker family on Christmas morning -- and some of them involve smelly bloodhounds.

Yes, the plot is pretty simple -- it's the delivery that makes it special. It's narrated by an adult Ralphie who offers his slightly sardonic take on everything (""We plunged into the cornucopia quivering with desire and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice""), mingled with a hint of nostalgia. And it's completely tuned in to how kids think, and how a toy can seem like the most important thing in the world.

Fortunately the scriptwriters never condescend to the audience by adding some kind of syrupy message -- after all, real life doesn't work that way. Instead there are all sorts of classic moments -- the leg lamp, Chinese turkey, the terrifying visit to Santa (""HOOOO HOOOO HOOO!""), and Ralphie's fantasies of defending his family with ""Ol' Blue"" against a bunch of inept, unarmed bandits.

And Jean Shepherd -- the co-writer and narrator of the movie -- deserves especial credit for bringing this movie to life. He covers the movie with a snowstorm of one-liners and hilarious dialogue: ""Over the years I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap."" ""He looks like a pink nightmare!"" ""Oh FUUUDDDDGGGE!"" and others.

Billingsley is a little stiff as Ralphie, but gives the portrayal of this everykid his charming, slightly frenetic best. Melinda Dillon and Darin McGavin are the comic geniuses here, with their slightly kooky but loving parents (one of the highlights is Dillon's ""show me how the piggies eat!"" scene, and McGavin's revolted response), and there's an array of very convincing bullies and classmates too.

""A Christmas Story"" didn't get much notice when it came out in 1983. But now it's one of the quintessential holiday movies, and a must-see at Christmastime. HOOOOO HOOOOO HOOOO...",1190937600,23,2998,4.774131274131274

For those of you who are not familiar with the movie.  It is set in the 1940s at Christmastime in Indiana.  Ralphie wants a Red Rider BB gun.  Every time he mentions it to an adult, the adult tells him that he will shoot his eye out with it.

412462,5,6301966554,"The most unsual christmas story, set on the USA of 50's that tells the struggle of a little boy and his Santa Claus gift desire within a mildly disfuntional family, it sure looks like something that cannot be understood or appreciate it by a contemporary foreign father and son... think again, this movie is able to go compare to the classics and it is indeed one of them.

I always watched this movie started when it was shown here in Venezuela in the early 90s in the public state tv (nowdays it would be impossible, with the communist anti-american regime that has seized power, foreign christmas ideas as the tree and santa claus are labelled ""imperialistic transculturization"")and I can only say that I was always amazed. The translation in spanish is so perfect that it helps me put some of the description in a proper context when I see it in english.

The setting, the acting, the production and the story is mastefully orchestrated creating indeleble scenes that will always live in our memories. My son and I have always a good time remembering the scenes and the expressions from this movie, that I sure it will stregthen your codes and memories with your loved ones as well.

I will have to say that the story is a bit acid and some of the parental punishments that I lived such as ""washing your mouth with soap"" are seldom seen today,  proper appreciation might can be expected with more age, yet I have seen that kids also enjoy this trip down a nostalgic era that neither them or I lived. When we showed it to my dad, his eyes glowed when he saw the ""Red Ryder rifle"".

When I was a kid the ""Wizard of Oz"" was the movie per exellance- now kids do not even know that exists- so when our heroe sees his mother and school teacher turn (in his imagination) to the wicked-witch-of-the-west we can appreciate how well this scene fits in the overall setting of the movie.

I will give anything away, for many reviewers have done that and each of us have a favorite scene. We can all relate to our little hero on his plight to make ask Santa the red ryder bb gun rifle, though I think many of us never lived to have a the store santa stepping on our face to slide us off down the north pole tobogan. I would say this is the perfect classic for parents who will also understand perfectly the oddities and affection mom and dad display through out the movie.

If your kids are too small I am not sure it will be appreciated, this is a tale told by the narrator (who is remebering his childhood) in a very erudite manner, which is also part of what makes it enjoyable since it constrast with the simplicity of the kid, we can appreciate that but a small kid...

412558,3,6301966554,"Jean Shepherd's 'A Christmas Story' deserves to be the classic it is.  It is a likable reminiscence of a Christmas past when the author's near self, Ralphie, yearns to get an airrifle for Christmas.  He makes every hint possible, but is always rebuffed with the counsel, ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  In the midst of his unfulfilled desire, is the usual hijinx with his school teacher and the pursuit of the neighborhood bullies.

Much of the movie is episodic with fun scenes that thread loosely with the main plot.  There's the ""mouth washed out with soap"" anecdotes that are worthy as well as his father's (Darren McGavin) anxious pursuit to win prizes (like a guache stockinged leg lamp) and his fight against the faltering furnace.  Narrated by Shepherd, himself, the memoir is a fun and funny trek through holidays past.  Some of the best scenes include his inner imaginative takes on life, like his soap blindness scene and his teacher's transformation into the wicked witch of school themes.

412559,1,6301966554,"Two Decembers ago, my colleagues and I were discussing Christmas movies over lunch. They were dumbstruck to learn that I had never seen ""A Christmas Story."" One offered to buy me the video. Then last month, a friend mentioned that a cable station would be showing back-to-back episodes on Christmas eve. So I watched it.

It was the worst Christmas movie I had ever laid eyes on. Why would anyone desecrate Christmas with a tale of a vulgar father, a pathetic mother, and ordinary children, all living in a dilapidated home in a bedraggled neighborhood, overrun by obnoxious kids, and highlighted by an insipid teacher, a callow Santa Claus, and truculent elves?

For the humor, of course! But the movie is humorless, the cast awful, and the story painfully long and pointless.

The sine qua non of Christmas movies has always been a central message --some nugget of hope, or redemption, or love -- conveyed either seriously or humorously. This movie, having none of these, illustrates the extent to which postmodern cynicism has swallowed a beloved film genre. Good Christmas movies have universal appeal. Can anyone imagine this movie being seen outside the U.S.? I can't, unless there's a place where train wrecks are ""cute"" and reminisced upon with wistful nostalgia.

Steve

P.S. After posting the above review, I received a barrage of criticism. One thoughtful critic argued, correctly, that my review lacked specificity and perspective. And so I submit this addendum:

My disappointment with the movie centers on four themes: the behavior of most characters, the absence of redemption, the absence of universality, and the absence of a transcendent message.

Regarding the characters, I was especially disturbed by the parents. We are told that the father curses incessantly (though we do not hear his invectives). His fascination with the ugly lamp is bizarre and sophomoric; his rawness, disconcerting. He is not alcoholic or physically abusive, but these are the only elements missing from a caricature too often seen. The mother's obsequious relationship with her husband, which renders her unable, or unwilling, to express her distaste for the ""award"", presumably out of fear of verbal reprisal, is unnerving. (I can already hear the chorus of detractors saying her restraint stems from affection).

Of course, each of us brings to a movie his personal experience. I have practiced medicine for thirteen years, and I cannot count the times I've encountered women who became withdrawn and depressed after years of quiet deference to overbearing men. Just the hint of such a relationship makes me recoil.

By contrast, the children are endearing. But this is less a credit to the movie than a tribute to the general sweetness of youth. The children are not selfish, as some have suggested. (A child's wish for a gift and his joy in receiving it are natural. Having owned a BB gun myself, the experience is familiar). But as one reviewer states, every character above the age of 30 is scary. Two hours spent in a town overpopulated with beastly elves, bullies, and parents, is two hours lost.

Second, I was saddened by the lack of redemption. Ask yourself this: Is any character improved by his experience? Imagine a Scrooge unchanged by his momentous journey. Imagine a Lear unenlightened by his travails. The hallmark of a great Christmas story --- of any great story --- is the transformative experience. From this emanates the hope and magic of Christmas.

Third, the movie lacks universality. No one understood universality better than Shakespeare. His comedies are as funny today (in Indiana and India) as they were centuries ago. We relate to the plight of kings and paupers, without ourselves being kings or paupers, because their sufferings, joys, and longings, are our own, no matter the century or country. ""A Christmas Story,"" by contrast, is parochial. The vignettes are amusing only to those with similar experiences. Parochialism is not, of itself, detrimental, but it does preclude the designation, ""classic.""

Finally, I was distraught by the absence of a transcendent message. One detractor explains that several messages are evident: listen to your parents, stand up to bullies, don't trust commercials, etc. But these are practical lessons, not universal themes rising to such heights as George Bailey, the Ghost of Christmas Past, or even Linus, have taken us.

So my detractors close in for the kill: Isn't ""realism"" better than the canned moralizing of standard classics?

If what we seek is realism, why not call this movie ""A Birthday Story"" instead of ""A Christmas Story?"" Had Ralphie requested a BB Gun for his birthday, his creators would have been spared the Christmas burden, the expectation of something ennobling --- hope, love, kindness, forgiveness, sympathy --- something that surmounts the mundane and takes us, if only briefly, to a finer place. In my humble view, Hammond, Indiana, is not such a place.",1167004800,31,4950,5.110148514851486
412560,5,6301966554,"Believe it or not, this is one of my favorite comedy Christmas movies I've ever watched. I've seen it at least 10 times within the last two months on DVD, and I'll probably see it again another 20 on TBS today. The movie itself is pretty humorous. It reminds me of when I was a child in elementary and how fun that day was. The acting was so phenomonal to me, because all the parts were played well. My favorite part was when the Ralphie says in a very fast pace that he wasnts a Red Rider BB Gun to the Macy's mall santa, only to get the common response ""You'll shoot your eye out kid..."". Then he kicks Ralphie down the slide. This DVD is very fun to watch. This movie came out in 1983, and it's actually older tha I am. It includes a trailer, comentary, and interviews with the characters. Like I said before, I've seen it many times, and it never gets old at all. If you're reading this review right now today, TBS is playing the movie all day, so you can't miss it.

412561,3,6301966554,"I really like this movie.  It reminds me of Christmas when I was a kid around the age of 8.  Although I wasn't living during the time period of the movie, my parents were alive during that time and insisted on playing this movie every Christmas from 1983 forward.  I enjoy it now, as an adult because, when I watch it, I can hear my dad laughing at some of the scenarios presented in the film.  It was this movie that inspired my normally quiet father to regale us all with stories of his youth.  No matter how many times I see it, I find myself tearing up when his father tells him to look behind the desk for the hidden christmas present!
I also enjoyed it because it was supposed to take place somewhere in my homestate of Indiana (proving that it is possible to get a solid english language education elsewhere in the state).

With a little help from IMDB and in direct response to the previous ""writer"" from Hammond:

To find an American city resembling an Indiana town of the 1940s, director Bob Clark sent his location scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland, Ohio, as the site for filming.

Ralph's school exteriors were filmed at Victoria School in St. Catharine's, Ontario, Canada.

The film's setting is a town in Indiana, but was actually filmed in Cleveland, Ohio. The street the ""Parker's"" live in is called ""Cleveland Street"".

The movie was based on a city in Indiana named Hammond. References were made throughout the film to support this claim. Examples: Harding school (on 165th St.) where Flick stuck his tongue to the flagpole (The flag pole that Flick got his tongue (notice the spelling!)stuck to was a theatrical prop), Goldblatt's department store, the mention of Griffith (a city that borders Hammond), Cleveland Ave and other streets that are located in Hammond. Although the movie was not filmed in Hammond the houses and look of the film is very authentic. Jean Shepherd (Writer) grew up in Hammond.

Parts of the movie, including the Christmas tree shopping scene, were filmed in Toronto, Ontario. One of Toronto's trademark red trolleys can be seen driving by the shot of the outside of the tree lot.

The Department Store featured in the Santa scene is really Higbee's in Downtown Cleveland. There were no Higbee's in Hammond.

Enjoy the film!  I just watched it in Blu-ray format and it is amazingly clear!  There is also some nice footage of what the main characters look like as adults and the impact that being in this film has had on their lives.",1166572800,2,2494,4.675057208237987
412562,5,6301966554,"I've owned the previous barebones single disc DVD as well as the pretty impressive 2-disc widescreen version. So this purchase was a no brainer for me. There is always a question of improvement in picture/sound quality when upgrading from standard def to high def, particularly with a film over 20 years old. I'll just get it out of the way right off the top. The 1080p video is just beautiful. Is this as good a transfer as ""Batman Begins?"" Well, d'uh! NO. Is it better than the previous DVDs of ""A Christmas Story?"" Heck, yeah! Detail is rich and there is hardly any compression artifacts or video noise whatsoever. One could almost count the individual fibres of the fur on Santa's suit. Film grain is present, but it should be since this is, um, a film. I did detect what appeared to be mosquito noise in the moonlight reflected on Ralphie's face as he happily falls asleep on Christmas night, but that's the only nit I can find to pick at. But all in all this is a pretty great video transfer.

The Dolby Digital Plus 1.0 mono track is fine, I guess. I really can't comment too much, being more of a videophile than an audiophile. But I'm sure it's a sonic improvement over the pedestrian Dolby Digital track from the standard def packages...

Warner Bros has ported over all the supplementals from the previous 2 disc version - even the two easter eggs, allbeit not hidden on this version but as part of the special features lineup. The supplementals were just fine on the last DVD and they fit in nicely here. Of special note, the supplementals are presented in 480p widescreen, taking full advantage of your widescreen tv's full 16:9 frame. This is a good thing.

~RANT~ WB and other studios used to present the special features of their DVDs in full 16:9 anamorphic glory, but have stopped this practice on their more recent home video offerings. Even if the feature was filmed in widescreen - a logical candidate for 16:9 treatment, no? - they are now too often reformatted to 4:3. Some of WBs HD-DVDs port over these unenhanced widescreen features which will be displayed on HDTVs STILL unenhanced...! Makes me crazy! WB and all other studios - I'm not asking for full 1080p, but please fill my screen. It's asinine to present a widescreen image in 4:3 letterbox! Oy... ~END OF RANT~

All that to say this: The supplementals on ""A Christmas Story"" remain untouched and fill my 16:9 screen. And I'm happy.

In summation, this is a fine HD-DVD package and it should bring much joy  to you for years to come. If you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy this HD-DVD. Enthusiastically recommended.",1166486400,2,2611,4.628509719222462
412563,5,6301966554,"This movie is an annual Christmas ""Event"" in my household, second to none.  Of course other annual Christmas movie traditons in our home include the classic ""Charlie Brown Christmas"", and one dear to my heart, ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"".  However, those hold mainly nostalgic value for me -- I enjoy them immensely of course -- but none can compete with ""A Christmas Story"" for pure entertainment value!

I first saw this as a pre-teen, along with my family.  It was an instant classic for us, and we watched it every year.  I of course continued this tradition into adulthood - introducing it to my husband and then my kids (the younger two don't quite get it yet, but my almost 10 year old loves it!).

This movie has all the great nostalgic touches -- the perfect example of a 40's-era midwest American family, complete with many highlights of that golden age (which I admittedly only know through stories of my parents, but they are touching nonetheless).

More than the touches of yester-year warmth, however, the absolute hilarity of this Christmas movie is simply unparallelled.  Several holiday movies since then have tried to match its comic value, and none have come close.

I love funny movies -- but real, truly laugh-out-loud ones are as rare as a snowstorm in Texas.  This one is the real deal.

If you haven't seen it, please -- run, don't walk to your nearest movie rental store and GET IT. The childhood antics and dreams of Ralphie will win your heart forever, and several lines and scenes from the movie will stay with you always.

Watching it every single year since the mid-eighties has not diminished my fresh enjoyment of it one iota.

I laughed throughout the movie as nostalgia shook my memory. I remember being told that if I had a bb gun I would shoot my eye out. I remember my mother washing my mouth out with soap, and when Ralphie's mother asked where he had heard ""that"" word his answer is Schwartz but he knew that it was his dad which has actually taught him the word. It reminded me of my youth as these things actually happened to me and others that I knew so to me the movie portrays a normal family for that generation.

A boy named Ralphie and the phrase 'You'll poke your eye out'!
A Red Ryder BB Gun and a sexy, black-mesh leg that's a lamp!

A bar soap wielding mother and an expletive shouting father.
A pepto-bismol pink Easter bunny suit and a boy who eats like a piggy.

You're right! They all add up to A Christmas Story!
It is about Ralphie, wonderfully played by Peter Billingsley, who longs for a Red Ryder BB Gun!
He repeatedly hears 'You'll poke your eye out' every time he mentions the gun.

Darrin McGavin is terrific as the contest entering father who is ecstatic when he finally wins.
His prize, a leg-shaped animated lamp complete with a black mesh stocking!
In his eyes the leg of lamp (I coudn't resist) is absolutely beautiful and,
much to the dismay of his wife, he proudly displays it for all to see in their front window.
The lamp is a major source of contention between them as each one attempts to move it.
His language when anything goes wrong - from the exploding furnace to the sparking wiring
to the neighbors free roaming dogs has reprecussions when, in frustration, Ralphie repeats them.
Enter Mom with the soap! Don't worry you won't hear the actual words being said but you will get
the gist of it - or should that be drift, as this is a winter story.

Little brother, Randy, is a picky eater and is only successfully coaxed to eat by his mother, played perfectly
by Melinda Dillon, when she has him pretend to eat like his favorite storybook animal, a pig.
With his face firmly in the plate he eats like one much to the disgust of his father!

Although based on the Red Ryder BB gun, there are many other storylines highlighted in this wonderful movie.
There are bullies, school friends, Christmas tree lots, Santa coming to town and the hilarious Christmas gift
of a  pink Easter Bunny outfit poor Ralphie has to try on. You will enjoy this movie!
It takes place at a time when I was growing up and many of the scenes recall my childhood.
To those of us who grew up in the forties and early fifties it brings back fond memories of our past Christmases.
We had real trees adorned with tinsel and glowing with big colorful bulbs, no themed trees with just white
lights, our trees glowed with a rainbow of colors. We had favorite radio shows, wore galoshes and had
backyards with snow covered sheds just like the ones in Ralphie's backyard.
All of those are in this film, and as such, A Christmas Story has a wonderful familiarity about it.
You can almost smell the heavy scent of pine mixed with the delicious aroma of a roasting turkey.
This movie is a classic and will, once again, be eagerly watched by our family.

IN A NUTSHELL:RALPHIE IS A BOY ON A MISSION -- A CHRISTMAS MISSION

Here we have the ideal young boys Christmas yarn, adapted from a memoir by humorist Jean Shepherd, who narrates throughout the film.

NEVERTHELESS - FOR RALPHIE ITS ALL ABOUT REACHING HIS GOAL:

We have a lofty goal - THE RED RYDER BB GUN under the tree! To reach this goal he must overcome the growing din of naysayers including his teacher and mother who insist: ""YOU'LL SHOOT YOUR EYE OUT!!!!!!

To reach that goal we have objectives - giving clues to mom and dad, getting Miss Shields [5th grade teacher] to endorse the idea, and going directly to ""THE MAN"" - SANTA, to enlist his support.

BUT THERE IS MORE - MUCH MORE!

For starters, we have a ten year old's strange fantasies - having ""BLACK BART"" and his gang all ""pushing up daisies"" after a showdown with cowboy Ralphie and ""Old Blue"" [his Red Ryder].

We have a dare that goes from bad to worse as it escalates into a ""Triple Dog Dare""! What ensues, is simply something that we suggest you don't try at home. That is, unless you want to get your tongue frozen stuck to a pole?

We have Bully's and their henchmen. We have really cool narration. Plus, we have Dad and his major award silliness, when he isn't fighting furnace fires, the Buppases dogs and just plain acting uncool in a perfect dad sort of way.

Add to that, we have Chinese turkey and christmas themes, flat-tires, a soap poisoning fantasy, a little boy wearing a little girl's pink bunny outfit and the long awaited ""Little Orphan Annie"" decoder set with a letter countersigned by Annie in real ink! We have a little brother, an epiphany over mom and some typical school chums getting into trouble stuff too.

There is very nice mood music mostly by Brass Ensemble, when its Christmas, and more fully orchestrated for ""The Grand Canyon Suite"" and other familiar tunes that are appropriate to the period [late 1940s in Northern urban Indiana]

BOTTOM LINE:

Super-duper entertainment that you can enjoy with the whole family. It never gets tiring and it actually grows on you over time. I first saw ""A Christmas Story"" at the Vero Beach [FLA] Drive-In in 1983, and I have looked forward to seeing it, dozens of times, since.

ABOUT THE DVD:

I have never seen the 2-Disk set. The single disk, full-screen version I do have is quite an improvement over the VHS version insofar as picture quality is concerned. There are NO FEATURES, and that is of course sad as this type of nostalgic film with child actors really would benefit from that.

412646,5,6301966554,"Ralphie... a man before his time. A victim of BB gun ""gun control."" Harrassed by bullies, disillusioned by Little Orphan Annie products... Ralphie is maturing despite himself.

The funniest scenes involve the stuffed stiff little brother, whose winter garb made him ""look like a tick about to pop.""  I thought my mother was the only over-protective winter alarmist!!

Even small, unimportant moments make me laugh... such as when a ""Wizard of Oz"" style witch garbed woman is working the crowd lined up to see Santa starts bothering poor Ralphie, and calls him a ""tasty little morsel."" Ralphie, obsessed with soliciting the big red guy for his Holy Grail of Christmas Presents, responds...

""Uh... leave me alone... I'm, uh... THINKING.""

Ralphie articulates what all kids feel, he daydreams almost as much as I used to.

Some forgivable weaknesses in this film is an over-used soundtrack, ""cluing us in"" as to when we're supposed to laugh... it's repetative music just gets in the way of the humor!

Another forgivable flaw is how the movie is actually a series of events, loosely strung together by it's ""anecdote master"" writer. Still, that's how real life is... not every daily occurance is tied in to the next.

The odd style profanity depictions of the father also takes some getting used to... ""glabber-puss, humbuckle dash-heimer!!""  We're supposed to imagine the actual terms... which are more commonly heard on television these days than in the movies in the 80s.

Ralphie represents the childhood experiences most of us have had... whenever they grew up. It's timeless nostalgia!

The DVD extra features serve us well enough, considering the fact that this movie was considered a theatrical ""flop"" of the mid 80s. It's been a mega-force Holiday tradition in the years proceeding!

5.  Ralphie's mother getting the younger brother to eat his mashed potatoes by getting him to pretend he was a pig at an eating trough.

6.  Ralphie beating the living daylights out of the bully Scott Farcus (sic?).

7.  The impatient Santa Claus and elves at the department store who terrorized the kids.

8.  Ralphie's dad's winning the tacky leg lamp.

The movie is a great story about Christmas time in the Midwest in a simpler era (I guess the 1950s or so) and the small town values that many today yearn for.  The movie still entertains and teaches good values without demeaning the true meaning of Christmas without being politically correct (i.e. - singing Christmas carols about Jesus Christ during an opening scene, closing the movie with Ralphie's parents snuggling up on a couch on Christmas night to the tune of Silent Night).

The only reason I did not give the movie 5 stars was the cussing (of which there was too much for my taste).  I believe the cursing could have either been totally deleted or muffled so the audience could not discern what was being said (as in the father battling the broken furnace scene - wish there could have been more of that).  I understand it is now possible to have your dvd or video doctored to where the cussing can be deleted and we may indeed do that.  I realize this sounds prudish to some, but we do have children.

Complaint aside, I do recommend the movie as a Christmas classic.  Enjoy and cover up your ears when the cussing scenes come up!",1135728000,,2042,4.559228650137741

Yes, I know it's not A Wonderful Life but I think that is the reason why I can relate to this movie.  The family in this movie is so typical of a family in the 1940's and the moral of this story is....Mom is alway's right.  Ralphie's mom won't let him get a BB gun because she says ""you'll put your eye out"".  The whole movie is based on Ralphie trying to convince his parents, his teacher and even Santa that he does deserve a BB gun.  There are many memorable scenes to this movie but my favorite is when Ralphie says the ""F"" word.  It is hilarious because his parents, just like parents today do not realize how much of what they say is absorbed and repeated by their children.

Ralphie, a lad in late 40's Cleveland, goes through all the kid rituals of the season, fantasizing about getting a Red Ryder BB gun.  His mom (Melinda Dillon) and dad (brilliantly played by Darren McGavin) may have other ideas.  Can Santa or his grade school teacher intervene?  Will the local bully meddle?

The film has great timing more than anything else, and the fade-outs to kid fantasies are hysterical.

That is one of the few strengths of this film, that the family is ordinary rather than wealthy and proper.

My favorite moment of the movie is when Santa Claus gives the little boy a kick.  It's the only real laugh in the film.

As for the rest of it, it's a children's film, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.

The bullying that takes place in the movie is disturbing.  I don't see any humor in it.  Bullying is no joke.  I was glad to see that the little boy gave the bully hell, eventually.  But it really isn't the kind of subject to make light of, and this movie does make light of it.  Oh well, haha, a neighborhood bully is tormenting the kids again, no big deal.

This film has become a beloved holiday classic, but somehow I seem to be immune to its charms.  It's not a bad movie, but it seems more like a better-than-average TV movie than a Christmas perennial that actually won two Genies (Canadians Oscars) for direction and screenplay.  However, I'll grant that the scene with the department store Santa is a classic.

So now Christmas Story has some nostalgia/retro thing going on, and we get all these rave reviews.  Here's why I don't quite understand:

First we've got that godawful ""Kevin Arnold"" voiceover from the main character.  Somebody write Hollywood and tell them to give that ""storytelling"" technique a rest.  Most of the other characters are ""broadly"" played, so we're never sure if we're watching a slice of life movie or a farce.

BB guns are beloved by many kids of my generation, but we all knew they could hurt us (and others), and the anxieties about bodily harm were real and not something you would generally try to play for laughs.  ""Put your eye out"".  What a knee-slapper!

Moving right along, we get the ""creep out"" extended joke about the ""fishnet thigh"" lamp.  This tasteless item is now available by mail order, in case you want one of these hideous things in your home.  Meanwhile, some kid gets his tongue stuck while licking a pole in freezing weather, Ralphie has to wear bunny pajamas, and visitors to Santa leave via a giant slide (what were the writers smoking?).  Towards the end, there's something about dogs getting in the kitchen and ruining the turkey, so the family goes out for Christmas dinner at a Chinese restaurant, where the staff removes the cooked goose's head because the father says ""it's smiling at us"".

My guess is that a number of parents rent this movie over the holidays on account of the word-of-mouth marketing by its little cult following.  When they realize how strange and humorless the film is, they just keep quiet.  There are probably very few ""repeat"" renters, but every Xmas season, a few people take the same chance.

It doesn't matter that the story is set in late 1945 --- if you remember your own childhood (or have kids in the right age) you will be able to relate to the trials & tribulations of Ralphie and his peers.  This movie is remarkably free of sappy nostalgia --- thank fortune --- and instead focuses on the ordeals of childhood with all of Shepard's mordant wit wonderfully intact.  The narrative & dialogue is exquisite and always has me laughing, even after repeated viewings.

From a historical perspective, I enjoy the fact that this is one of very very few films available today that deals with post-war 1940's USA.  I cannot think of many films (""Best Years of Our Lives"" --- any others?) that cover that particular time period, which seems to have disappeared from our collective memory for some reason.

Really, this is as good as it gets; a reminiscence of childhood without sentiment or nostalgia, and gobs of humor.

In the way of doing, he must dogde getting in trouble with his parents for saying terrible words, beating up school bullies, and complaining.

412817,5,6301966554,"Post holiday depression, the syndrome in which we overdose on Christmas cheer only to feel deflated when the tinsel is taken down and the tree is tossed to the curb, was considerably lessened for Cleveland, Ohio residents following yuletide 1982. Santa may have returned to the North Pole, but in the heart of the city, Christmas was extended as Hollywood came to town to make a modestly budgeted comedy titled ""A Christmas Story.""
As exciting as it was to have a movie made in one's own backyard, there was little to suggest this film would attract much attention beyond the city limits. The film's biggest star, Darren McGavin, was a superb actor but not a box-office name.  His star shone brightest on television where he memorably played the hard-boiled private investigator of NBC's 1968-69 series ""The Outsider"" and ghoul hunting newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak of ABC's ""The Night Stalker"" (1974-75). The director, Bob Clark, won admirers for his 1975 holiday themed thriller ""Black Christmas,"" but probably lost most of them after he directed ""Porky's,"" the teenage sex comedy that was a big hit with youthful audiences but widely reviled by almost everyone else.
Perhaps because it so superbly applied a modern sensibility to the innocence associated with an earlier era, ""A Christmas Story"" transcended its generic title and its distributor's indifference to become a modern classic following its release to television and home video.  Based on the wryly autobiographical work of humorist Jean Shepherd, ""A Christmas Story"" is set in the radio days of the Forties before television dulled our imaginations. Young Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) hears a commercial for a Red Ryder BB gun and becomes obsessed with receiving one for Christmas.  But whenever he expresses his wish to his mother, father, teacher, playmates, even Santa Claus, he hears the same dream crushing pronouncement: ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid.""
""A Christmas Story"" succeeds because it's sweet but never cloying.  It's grounded in reality yet avoids the cynicism that film-makers usually favor when attempting to avoid sentimentality.  Despite scenes reminiscent of one of Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post covers, the film never idealizes childhood or Christmas, and yet it positively glows with nostalgia.  The cast, especially McGavin, is superb, and so is the direction.  This film just may have benefitted from Clark's work on ""Porky's.""  If the characters in that sleazy teen comedy were thoroughly despicable, they may have at least helped Clark reign in Billingsley who may have otherwise overdone the cute aspects of his character.  Instead, the pint-sized protagonist is wholly believable. There hasn't been a Christmas film of this quality since the 1951 Alastair Sim version of ""Scrooge,"" and ""A Christmas Story"" can stand alongside the very best of them.",1071878400,,2854,5.282560706401766

Guys probably may be more empathetic since after all most of us had a Christmas or birthday were we wanted a BB gun. It is a early 1940s period piece that will appeal very strongly to those that grew up in the 40s or 50s. The author reflects back on the Christmas he wanted an Official Red Ryder BB gun.
Scenes of his family life are likely to make us cry with laughter because they strike a cord of truth of our own life experiences. Ever seen a kid get his tongue stuck on a cold object? You or friend beat up by a bully? Father cursing a flaky piece of equipment? Pets eat your Christmas dinner? Someone won a goofy prize but they displayed it like a special award from the President? You get the idea. The DVD is a good transfer and includes trailer, languages, et cetera. Well worth adding to Christmas DVDs along side Christmas Vacation, Scrooged, and Trading Places.",1071705600,,1025,4.288659793814433
412819,5,6301966554,"Twenty years after its initial release, ""A Christmas Story"" remains one of the most heartwarming, human and enjoyable Yuletide tales ever.  The casting of Peter Billingsley, Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin was truly inspired and are at the heart of this classic.  Billingsley's unabashed imagination, his wide-eyed awe of all that goes on around him, his desire to get that beebee gun, and his joyous love of life is one of the best children's performances on celluloid.  Melinda Dillon's Mom is a joy to behold---witness how she gets little Randy to eat his mashed potatoes and meatloaf--what a marvelous performance she gives--her love and admiration for her husband and children is evidenced in so many sublte ways and Dillon captures and embodies the wonder of motherhood.  McGavin, needless to say, is awesome.  Childlike, foul-mouthed, but the biggest kid in the movie.  This movie alone shows what an underappreciated and fine actor Mr. McGavin is.
Christmas' true meaning and its simplicity and joy have not been captured any more effectively in this Christmas gem.

412820,5,6301966554,"As old a movie the Christmas Story may be, it will continue to have its twenty-four hour special every Christmas Eve because it's such a great movie. Not only is it hilarious, but it's also a great movie for the whole family to relax, lay around a warm fire, make some popcorn and all watch together. If you're looking for a funny, real-life, all together classic movie, The Christmas Story is the way to go.
A Christmas Story was a hit when it first came out in 1983. Melinda Dillion, Darren McGavin, Peter Billingsley, and Ian Petrella are the four main characters in the movie. Peter, being Ralphie Parker, was the main one that the movie was basically all about. Ian was his little brother, Randy Parker, who followed him around all the time, and the other two were his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Parker. All the characters in the movie, evenif they weren't one of the four that I mentioned all added a little something to the flick.
""You'll shoot your eye out!"" That's all anyone ever said to poor Ralphie when he told them he wanted a Red Rider BB gun for Christmas. He didn't want a football. He didn't want a G.I. Joe. He didn't want that stupid, pink bunny suit he got from his aunt. All Ralphie wanted was his BB gun. The mother, being the cautious, old fashioned woman she is, wouldn't think twice about the BB gun, but the father on the other hand had a different point of view. Finally the big Christmas day arrives and the family opens up all the presents. No gun. The father asks Ralphie if he see's the hidden present that Ralphie must have missed. Could it be a football? Could it be a G.I. Joe? Could it be the gun? The Christmas dinner is a disaster, but Christmas as a whole was the best Christmas ever.
The Christmas Story is a great movie to watch, even if it's not around Christmas time. It's so funny and fun to watch that there's no way anyone could possibly NOT like it. It's got great characters, an awesome theme, and a lot of humor.
All in all, The Christmas Story is a must see. It's a Christmas tradition, and if you haven't seen it by now, make sure you tune your tv's to the Christmas Story on Christmas Eve all day and night long. The Christmas Story has beenone of my all time favorite movies since I was little, and it will continue to be, because no matter how long it's been around, this is a movie that will never grow old.",1070409600,3,2357,4.334841628959276

412823,5,6301966554,"The people that have rated this movie less than 5 stars apparently take themselves too seriously and/or live in an idealistic fantasy world.  Face it people, Ralphie IS an everyday kid who swears and wants a gun and fantasizes about misadventures with bad guys and fights with his little brother.  And THAT'S what makes this movie so doggone special!!!
I love the whole thing.  I think it's genious.  I think that Peter Billingsley plays the part of Ralphie to perfection.  He is believeable as the slightly nerdy, slightly average boy who enrolls in the Little Orphan Annie Secret Society decades before that would have been considered majorly ""uncool"".  And when the family fights over who's gonna be Santa, rips into the Christmas presents in their jammies and then share wine while looking at the tattered wrapping paper...well, it takes me back to my OWN childhood, which I feel blessed was very special and endearing (yet far from perfect).  However, I'm a student nurse and fairly well-adjusted, so I'd like to think that my parents did a dandy job.  And when Ralphie's dad surprises him with the gun....that scene is priceless because COUNTLESS other children have been suprised by their fun-loving dads and the magic of Santa, too.  And it takes THEM back.
A Christmas Story is a wonderful film for the WHOLE family.  People, life is NOT perfect.  Get over yourselves.  Have fun and grab yourselves a heavily spiked egg nog before laughing yourself silly...especially if this is the first time you've seen this Christmas gem that will forever be my favorite holiday film.",1068768000,4,1580,4.943181818181818

It's a testament to all involved with this movie that I, and everyone I've talked to, feel this way. My holidays aren't complete without revisiting Ralphie and his slightly eccentric family. I still die laughing when Ralphie's oblivious mother asks where he learned to curse, and calls up his friends house instigating a beating.

412846,5,6301966554,"A Christmas Story is about a young boy named Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his dream of owning a Red Rider BB gun.  Ralphie decides to ask for his dream prize for Christmas only to hear his mother, teacher, and even Santa Claus give him the typical adult response, ""you'll shoot your eye out"".  The movie focuses on Ralpie's life and his endless scemes to win his coveted prize.  The setting takes place in the early 1940s in a middle class, midwestern small town.  The movie does a wonderful job of telling the story from a child's point of view all the way down to his daydreaming and scemes.  The subplots like the ""Scott Fargus Affair"", and the ""major award"" that Ralpie's father (Darren McGavin) wins in a silly crossword puzzle contest only add to the humor and charm of this holiday classic.  Melinda Dillon plays Ralpie's stay-at-home mother, and Ian Petrella plays Ralphie's irritating baby brother.
If you are looking for a funny and charming trip down memory lane then this movie is a  must see.  It will take you back to the innocence of your childhood when you and all of your friends still believed in Santa Claus and the true magic of Christmas.  This movie was written primarily for adult viewers because of the nostalgic feel, but can be enjoyed by people of all ages.  For the past several years, the TNT network has run this movie 24 hours nonstop on Christmas eve and Christmas day.

412849,5,6301966554,"In 1983, the greatest Christmas movie of all-time was released: ""A Christmas Story"". This movie is my personal all-time favorite Christmas movie. When the Christmas season is coming, I can't stop watching the movie from November 30 - December 31. It's the only Christmas movie I can't get sick of. The cast, the story and the comedy is OUTSTANDING!!
The movie starts out in a small Indiana town in the 1930's. Here we meet Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), a nine-year-old who is desperate to get his hands on the perfect Christmas gift: An official Red Rider Carbon-Action 200-shot loader range model air rifle. As badly as he wants this gift more than anything, his mom, teacher, and a mall Santa Claus say ""You'll shoot your eye out!"" That doesn't stop Ralphie from making his dream come true.
As Christmas comes closer and closer, a bunch of mishaps happen between his friends, and his family. His friend Schwartz talked his other friend Flick into sticking his tounge to a flag pole, and his tounge got stuck. Then Ralphie beats up a school buly named Scut. His father (McGavin) wins a lamp that is in the form of a leg that he loves and nobody else does, including his warmhearted mother (Dillon). The really goofy side to his family is his cry-baby little brother Randy. He won't eat! He's always complaining and crying and his laugh is SO FUNNY! He's a typical six-year-old rugrat.
Will Raplhie let a teacher, a mall Santa and even his own mother stop him from making his Christmas dream come true? You'll see. The movie really gets you into the holiday season. It's an EXCELLENT family movie. Everyone I know loves this movie. It's addicting! Your Christmas collection is not complete if you don't have this movie on your shelf. Even the T.V. station TNT does a 24-Hour marathon of ""A Christmas Story"" EVERY YEAR! Watch ""A Christmas Story"" and you will NOT be disappointed. Merry Christmas!

412850,5,6301966554,"When A CHRISTMAS STORY originally arrived in theatres, it was only around for about three weeks because the studios didn't feel it would make any money and felt the story didn't lend itself to a longer theatrical run. It wasn't until the movie started airing on televsion and cable that people found out how great a movie A CHRISTMAS STORY is. Since then, the movie has become a piece of our American heritage, a part of the pop culture paradigm, and (like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE) a Christmas classic.
The film revolves around nine-year-old Ralphie whose only wish for Christmas is to own a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot Carbine Action BB gun. However, everyone from his mother to his teacher to Santa Claus himself tells him it's too dangerous and that ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" Along the way, Ralphie and his friends and family get involved in all sorts of comic mishaps. However, in the end everything turns out alright and everyone has a merry Christmas.

The movie is full of hilarious heartfelt nostalgia. Anyone who has ever been part of a family or from a rural (in mindset) town will enjoy watching this film again and again. Recommended for viewing at least once a year. And, oh, yeah; don't shoot your eye out.

The DVD includes the original theatrical trailer.",1052006400,,1276,4.7174887892376685
412851,5,6301966554,"Let's face it.  99% of the people who have seen this movie never saw it in theater.  Their first experience, like mine, was either on video or a TV broadcast just before Christmas.
Perhaps whoever put out this DVD wanted some quick money, and therefore avoided the widescreen format.  As for me, I love the fullscreen effect since it adds to the nostalgia of the film.  It reminds me of seeing the movie as a kid for the first time on TV at Christmas time.
As for the film itself, this movie is quite easily the best Christmas movie ever made.  The comments that it portrays a dysfuncitional family couldn't be farther from the truth.  Besides telling a funny story, this movie portrays not only how most families are, but how they should be.
We have two young brothers who constantly fight the way brothers do, but never in a way to say they hate each other.
We have a mother constantly making sure her kids are safe and happy.  Note the scenes where she brings Randy milk when he's crying, or how she diverts attention away from Ralphie after ""the fight.""
As a couple, the parents argue the same way all parents do.  How would your wife react to a giant leg-shaped lamp?!  Sure they argue at times, but aside from sharing every meal together as a family, we see Ralphie's parents at the end of the movie holding each other by Christmas tree light, watching the snow fall at night.
Then there's Ralphie's Dad.  Sure he ""works in profanity the way other artists work in oil...,"" but no one can deny the love he shows Ralphie Christmas morning.  Throughout the movie Raphie tries to sell his mother into buying him a BB gun only to find out it was his Father who knew all along.  When the Father is watching his overjoyed child unwrap and prepare his new treasure, I still smile everytime.  In fact, the only travesty about this movie is that the Father didn't receive an Academy Award for Best Actor in this scene.
Overall this movie couldn't be better.  In a world filled with politically correct super fuzzy Christmas movies, it's great to sit down and watch a classic Christmas movie.",1051488000,3,2087,4.51595744680851

But there are 2 things That I don't like about the movie and being from the same town in where this movie took place in, i feel that my opinion is valed, so if your not from around here then there are a few things that you should know and next time you watch this movie, keep them in mind.  First, in the movie the narrator calls the town HOHMAN, Indiana, there is no such place as Hohman its really called Hammond,Indiana, Hohman is the the name of the main street in downtown Hammond and Its called Hohman Avenue, now i don't know why Jean Shepard did this And if he wanted to be really specific he would have called the town HESSVILLE which is the part of Hammond this story really takes place in. So the City is Hammond but Hessville is the part of Hammond where this movie is supposed to take place.  Now in the movie Ralphie grew up on the LEFT side of Cleveland Street but in all actuallity he lived on the RIGHT side of Cleveland Street further down by (now known as FLICKS TAP which is a bar on Kennedy Ave. that FLICK himself built) see the movie is about Jean Shepard when he was a little kid but he gave some of the characters different names, and changed te name of the city, except for Flick and a few of his other friends, those are real people.  now i thought the movie was great and everything else was perfect i think that jean shepard was a brilliant man (thats why we just built this recreation center and named it after him) I just wish he would have did the littles things that would, for me, make the movie even better. so IF YOUR ever in the area you should stop by theres alot of history here.  thanks for your time",1049673600,3,2317,4.165548098434004

Don't be fooled by the ""kiddie"" appearance of the cover. This is definitely a story for grown ups. Today's children would not be able to relate to it, which is a shame.

412890,5,6301966554,"Now before I even begin to review this movie, I would just like to clarify my title.  I call ""A Christmas Story"" the 2nd greatest Christmas movie of all time because in my opinion ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" is the greatest Christmas movie of all time.
Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's start the review!  This is a movie that unlike others, actually captures the true spirit of Christmas in every way possible.  Peter Billingsley stars as Ralphie, a young boy that cannot get his mind off of an official Red Ryder bb gun.  Right from the beginning of the film Ralphie is trying to hint to his parents what he wants for Christmas.  What makes this film really stand out is how it is told through the eyes and mind of a child.  You'll notice right off the bat, that the film does have a narrator, an older Ralphie.  But unlike other films, the narrator fits perfectly into the Christmas formula.
Darren McGavin stars as Raplhie's strict and serious father.  This strictness however passes off as some of the best humor in the film.  You even feel like you're watching ""Married with Children"" at times because like Al Bundy, you just want great things to happen to McGavin.  But I will not give away plot details (even though everyone reading this has probably seen this movie over 20 times).
As the story progresses the film continues and Ralphie is realizing how hard it is to try to convince his parents, teacher, and even Santa Clause, what a perfect gift the Red Ryder bb gun would make.  Each of these figures continues to haunt Ralphie with the classic saying, ""You'll shoot you're eye out kid!"".
I honestly can't review this movie to make it sound even half as great as it truly is, so go watch this movie or even buy it because it can be wacthed hundreds of times without getting the least bit dull.  But don't watch it during summer becuase it will depress you and make you think of Christmas.

Bad picture quality, very few extras, and, of course, the biggest rip-off of all, it's in full-screen instead of wide-screen.  Wasn't widescreen one of the main selling points for the DVD format?  Of course it was! This particular DVD was only put out to cash in on the popularity of the movie without taking the time, care, and money to take full advantage of the format.

Darren McGavin is great as the blustery but sentimental dad and Melinda Dillon as the mom who is wiser than her kids give her credit for.  The movie is touching and hilarious at the same time.  It's so hard being a kid sometimes!

412917,5,6301966554,"The 1983 film, ""A Christmas Story"", quickly became a holiday classic as viewers fell in love with its witty prose as narrated by Jean Shepherd (1921-1999), who wrote the novel upon which the film is based: ""In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash"".
The film begins weeks before Christmas in the city of Terre Haute, Indiana circa 1934.  A young Ralph 'Ralphie' Parker (Peter Billingsley) stares through the glass of a storefront window at the local department store to see what he wants most for Christmas, a Red Rider Be-Be Gun, and ponders the quandary of how to convince his parents to buy him one.  He leaves various clues in the house for his parents to find about how wonderful and necessary the be-be gun is, but when his mother (Melinda Dillon, who received Oscas nominations for her roles in the 1977 film ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and the 1981 film ""Absence of Malice"") asks him what he wants for Christmas during breakfast one morning, Ralphie excitedly blurts out, ""I want an official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle"".  His mother responds, ""No, that's too dangerous. You'll shoot your eye out.""  Ralphie is crushed at hearing the common adult ""prejudice"" against the be-be gun, but decides upon finding another tactical means of persuasion.
At school, Ralphie's teacher, Miss Shields, (Tedde Moore) assigns his class to write a Christmas theme. Most of the students are not happy with the assignment, but Ralphie sees this as another golden opportunity to bolster the superiority of the Red Rider be-be gun as the ideal Christmas gift.  He writes what he believes will be regarded a masterpiece, but when Miss Shields returns his theme, Ralphie is shocked to see a grade of ""C+"". To add insult to injury, Miss Shields writes in red ink, ""You'll shoot your eye out!""  For Ralphie, the universe is coming apart at the seams and it leads to one of the film's many subplots: a fight with the bully Scut Farcus (Zach Ward).  Throughout the first half of the film, Ralphie, his younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella) and his two friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) are terrorized by Scut Farcus and his toady Grover Dill (Yano Anaya).  Upon receiving a C+ for his prized theme, Ralphie's rage empowers him to mercilessly beat upon the unexpecting Scut Farcus and to express his Red Rider frustration in a torrent of obscenities (don't worry, they're unintelligible).  Fearing a severe punishment from his father (Darren McGavin, well-known for his characterization of Carl Kolchak in the 1972 TV-series ""The Night Stalker""), Ralphie & Randy tearfully wait for their father to return home from work; but their mother plays down the fight in a conversation with him to Ralphie's relief.
Ralphie's father is a fascinating character in the film with several great subplots: his unintelligible expressions of frustration with the neighbor's uncontrolled pack of dogs and struggles with their failing furnace, and his winning of a ""major prize"".  Ralphie's mother isn't too thrilled with her husband's ""major prize"" since it is a tall plastic lamp in the shape of a woman's leg wearing a black-lace stocking that he proudly displays in front of their livingroom window; but a mysterious and unexplained accident changes the sitation.
Other subplots in the film include Ralphie's ""Little Orphan Annie Secret Society Decoder Ring"", Ralphie assiting his father change a flat tire with unforeseen consequences, Schwartz challenging Flick to stick his tongue to a frozen flagpole to see whether it will get stuck, the discovery of Chinese turkey and the frequent overheating of inadequate electrical fuses and outlets in the Parker's home.
Jean Shepherd's narration throughout the film binds all of the many subplots into a coherent whole that continues to delight viewers of all ages to its timeless humor and realism.  Though the film itself gets 5 stars, DVD quality is far less than it what it could have been, as other reveiwers have remarked.  The DVD is full-screen instead of widescreen and there is little bonus material offered.  I highly recommend to Warner Studios that this film be digitally remastered in widescreen format and include additional bonus material, such as a biography of Jean Shepherd.
Though the DVD quality is low for ""A Christmas Story"", the film itself is well worth the purchase of the full-screen DVD.  This is a film that can be enjoyed at any time of the year, but especially during the holidays.  Watch and see whether Ralphie will ever get his beloved, official, Red Ryder, Carbine-action, 200-Shot, Range Model, Air Rifle!",1038873600,13,4612,5.018324607329843
412918,5,6301966554,"Since it's initial release back in 1983 I've seen this film at least a dozen and a half times. And I've loved it each time. With a wonderful somewhat laconic voiceover narrative by author Jean Shepherd (upon whose stories the movie is based) and terrific performances by Darren McGavin, young Peter Billingsley and Melinda Dillon, this is an immensely funny and even touching movie--with well-realized, wildly imaginative scenes (school bullies, getting a kid to eat, the father's love for an outrageously ugly leg-lamp won in a contest). There is something in which to take new delight with every viewing. Instead of the usual sappy, saccharine stuff that gets aired during the Christmas season, here's a movie with zest and bite. This is a film that uses its source material wonderfully well and succeeds in every way. Celebrate the season with glee and take in A Christmas Story.

412919,5,6301966554,"This is an ALL-TIME CLASSIC FAVORITE of mine. Being a film-purist (MA in cinema studies--my shameless plug), I do not say this lightly.
10-stars for the movie and 1 star for the DVD. Read on:
This is ""liquid literature"", i.e., literature on film. This is one of the few instances in filmdom where voice-overs are not only used properly, but are motivated by the film's style, disposition, and character. Form definately dictated the function of voice-over on this one, as should always be the case. Hearing Jean Shepherd's (author) voice-overs alone justifies the price of this DVD.
But ALL aspects are flawlessly executed: writing, director's tone, acting, texture/mood created by lighting, sets, ensemble cast (the children's performances match those achieved by Spielberg in ET), etc ... Darren McGavin sunk personal resources into this project as a ""labor of love,"" and we are blessed, for what a tragedy to filmdom had this film never been realized.
However, DVD itself is a disappointment. It is full-screen, not widescreen. I echo the comments made by previous users. This film is worthy of a complete digital remastering, both visually and aurally, and released in widescreen. I'd gladly pay a special price for such a classic edition of this timeless treat. These technical setbacks would not matter on a less-important work. But treating this film as a ""cheapie knockoff for a fast buck"" angers me.

A major part of the charm of the film is the fact that it takes place in the 1940's, when charm was still in vogue and simplicity dominated the times.  Ironically, this is unfortunate because if the film translates to today's times, the BB gun would translate into a Macintosh with Windows, 256 MB of Ram, etc.  You get the idea.
  I thought Darren McGavin stole the show.  My favorite scene involved him and Ralphie changing the tire.  When Ralphie loses the nuts to the hubcaps, he says the ""Queen Mother"" of all curse words; the big one that didn't come out as ""fudge"".  McGavin told him to get into the car.  The camera stays on McGavin and you notice the least bit of a smirk on his face, as if to say ""I know Ralphie's a good kid.  This is just part of his growing up"".
On all counts, this is a gem of a picture, with marvelous performances, directing and writing.  Almost every scene is memorable and can be bantered about over the holiday table.

I admit that I, like most folks, get nostalgic for a Christmas that sometimes seems so far off that it never really happened.
However, movies like this help me recapture some of the magic that Christmas meant when I was a boy (a local department store, Miller and Rhodes, now gone, had the REAL Santa, and you could have lunch with him and have Rudolph cake, in which you looked for hoof prints -- you know, that kind of thing), and that's not a bad thing, not at all.

Though set in the 1940s, its story is timeless, taking us back to when we were kids and so desperately wanted that one special gift under the tree on Christmas morning.  The movie brilliantly captures the obsession of young Ralphie and his quest for a Red Ryder BB gun, relaying perfectly the magic and thrill of Christmas through a child's eyes.

Intermingled with this are wonderful, hilarious snippets of the absurdities of everyday life, from poor Flick getting his tongue frozen to a flagpost, to the perpetually smoking coal furnace, to Ralphie getting his mouth washed out with soap for saying ""fudge"" (though we all know the word he *really* said), to the family's hapless introduction to ""Chinese turkey.""

But what sets ""A Christmas Story"" apart from most other holiday movies it its honesty.  Instead of preaching to us about ""the true meaning of Christmas"" or making us feel guilty about commercialism, the movie acknowledges what we all know but are often afraid to say -- it's all about the toys!

The movie takes place in a small midwestern town in the 1940's.
Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) wants, more than anything, to own an official Red Rider BB gun. Everyone he asks tells him he's gonna shoot his eye out. His parents, his teacher and even Santa Claus himself. What is a kid to do? We also get to see the everyday trials and tribulations Ralphie goes through, an annoying little brother, the bully at school and the everday battles with his mother (Melinda Dillon) and his father (Darren McGavin, who was probably my favorite character in the movie).

Now, to the movie itself. It's very good, something of a minor classic, enjoyable on several different levels, and bears repeated viewings. The raves that dominate among the customer reviews here tend to go too far, but still this is a wonderful little movie, brimming with wit, insight, rich characterization and period detail.
That said, some warning is needed beyond the PG rating -- many parents are apt not to take the PG seriously here, especially with the wholesome, somewhat saccharine photo montage bedecking its box.
This is actually something of a dark comedy, with a mildly cynical view of childhood, a gently subversive attitude toward adult authority, and a jaundiced, almost paranoid, take on commercialism. There are moments of deceit, cruelty, intimidation, and (well-deserved) violence, all played for laughs. (There are heartwarming moments as well, applaudably noncloying.) Parents of young children take note.
This is no FATHER KNOWS BEST or LEAVE IT TO BEAVER: There's no wise parent or pat ending here to iron out the wrinkles in the children's lives.

Narrated brilliantly by Jean Shepherd and based on his childhood memoirs, In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash, A Christmas Story (1983) has truly become a splendid holiday favorite classic rivaling in its popularity Frank Capra's masterwork ""It's a Wonderful Life"".
Set in the 1940's, director Bob Clark managed to capture the essence of childhood Christmas through the eyes of Ralphie, an unwittingly comical child whose imaginative character is both endearing and enduring. The plot revolves around Ralphie's aching desire for a Daisy Brand Red-Ryder BB rifle for Christmas, and his mom's opposition to it because she's afraid he'll shoot his eye out. We're amused by dad's on-going fight with the basement's smoke-belching furnace, and the old man's almost incessant child-like awe and obsession of a tacky woman's leg lamp he had won in a contest. Amid all of this, we meet Ralphie's whiny little brother, Randy, his silly school friends, the street bullies, and the surreal department store Santa.
Aside from ""you'll shoot your eye out"", the film is filled with memorable lines including Ralphie's major swear words ""Oh, fudge - only I didn't say fudge"", and ""Ovaltine? A crummy commercial? Son of a b..."" and his disappointment when he got his school paper back after he was expecting an A+, ""a C+? Oh no, it can't be!""

The movie takes place during the holiday season of the 1940s and is about a nine-year-old child named, ""Ralph Parker"" who longs for a Red Rider BB Gun to have for a Christmas present. However, there is one obstacle he would have to face in order to receive this gift: His mother doesn't approve of BB guns! But Ralph is determined to get past that obstacle by persuading Santa to give him the BB Gun for Christmas.
A Christmas Story is the movie I would definitely recommend for people to watch whenever the holiday season comes.",1009411200,,755,4.5588235294117645

Someday the distributors will release a WIDESCREEN version with some extras that we've come to expect from DVD releases: background on the creators, outtakes & deleted scenes, etc., but for now we have to be satisfied with the bare bones version here.  I have no complaints about the film itself --- it is flawless.  Those grumps who want to stand out by seeing this movie as the exact opposite of its intention (not for kids? COME ON, GROW UP!) will not enjoy anything remotely clever on the level of CHRISTMAS STORY but, so what, the world is full of people who only think ADULTHOOD=MATURITY.  This movie will be enjoyed by all ages for years to come...let's hope Warner Bros. is listening and they put together a definitive edition---I'd buy it in a second!",1009411200,,871,4.7105263157894735
413014,5,6301966554,"""A Christmas Story"" is a warm holiday movie filled with memorable moments and genuinely funny circumstances set in a time that has ceased to exist in America. It's a simple child's tale of the all-American Christmas, capturing a picture-perfect portrait of holiday warmth and zest through its delectable combination of laughter and touching moments. Most importantly, the film recalls the pleasures of childhood during the Christmas season, and that can provide as much joy as any other film.
The story is based on a segment of Jean Sheperd's novel ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,"" a personal memoir of his experiences. It helps that Sheperd collaborated in the creation of the screenplay, as well as lending his narration as the adult voice of Ralphie Parker (played by Peter Billingsley), who wants nothing more than to wake up on Christmas morning and find a ""genuine Red Ryder 200-Shot Carbine Action Air Rifle"" under the tree. Ralphie doesn't merely want this gift, but yearns for it with every fiber of his childhood being. His convictions that an English paper on what he wants for Christmas, as well as putting in his request to Santa Claus, stand as his assurance that he cannot fail in his quest.
Of course, there are obstacles, made whimsical and witty by director Bob Clark's wonderful knack for situational humor. His mother's words, ""You'll shoot your eye out,"" seem to echo from the mouths of everyone around, including his would-be alibi, Santa Claus, who is seen in a most frightening light by the children who line up to sit on his lap. Even Ms. Shields, his teacher, is a dead end, granting him a C+ on his ""All I Want For Christmas"" theme paper with a small note toting Mrs. Parker's infamous warning.
The film is a very warm and inviting Christmas story, capturing the holiday season of yesteryear in an authentic and gleeful manner. Set in Indiana in the 1940's, Clark captures small vignettes of the time period through Ralphie's life experiences, from his eager anticipation of a secret decoder machine sent by the radio show he listens to every night at 6:45, to his punishment for using foul language by keeping a bar of Lifebuoy soap in his mouth for a prolonged period of time (""Over the years, I got to be quite a connoisseur pf soap..."").
What helps the movie in the long run are its characters, who never overstay their welcome or lose the appeal they possess. Ralphie's parents, known only to us as Mom and the Old Man, are the perfect parents: his mother, played with supreme charm by Melinda Dillon, is a warm and caring woman, as shown in her methods of getting younger brother Randy to eat by referring to him as ""Mommy's little piggy,"" and in her protective yet nurturing nature in regards to her children. His father, a stern yet gentle man, is the ideal working-class family man who sits at the table, reads his paper, but still exudes a great deal of caring for his family. Darren McGavin's performance as Mr. Parker deserves high praise, especially in his childlike glee over winning a table lamp in the shape of a woman's leg.
Billingsley is the most notable of these actors, instilling Ralphie with all the emotions and thoughts a normal child experiences. His run-ins with neighborhood bully Scut Farcus provides a truly satisfying scene of turning the tables, while his daydreams of getting an A+ on his English paper and his going blind from ""soap poisoning"" are filled wit merriment and humor.
I think what ""A Christmas Story"" captures most effectively is the unbearable countdown to Christmas Day, which, for a child, can be the most excruciating twenty-four days of the year. Here is a movie that is guaranteed to bring back wonderful memories of childhood, with something that everyone from all generations can relate to, whether it be the joys of the long-awaited Christmas morning, or the shared pleasure of reliving the time and place, and the painstaking accuracy with which it is portrayed.",1009324800,4,3952,4.82179675994109
413015,5,6301966554,"I have always liked this film since I saw it when I was in 6th grade....almost 10 years ago.  It's funny.  It relies on actual dialogue and not special effects...so it's obviously for children and adults old and mature enough to have an attention span that doesn't need computer generated effects to keep them from wandering off.  It doesn't glorify owning a gun (gosh, it isn't a semi-automatic weapon, Ralphy is NOT a gang banger!)  He's just a little boy who wants a BB gun. It doesn't promote violence, it promotes children standing up to a bully, and finally, all children who can speak cohearantly KNOW what naughty words are, and that's why they put that in the film.  If people today just aren't teaching their children about life, BB-guns, and that swears are bad...it isn't this movie's fault :) and they could just stick to the cartoon version of the Grinch :)  This film, however, is fun, cute, and you can watch it over and over and over again without getting sick of it :)  It's why TBS has a 24 hour marathon of it ever christmas eve!

An almost magical story based on narrator Jean Sheapard's childhood adventures, this one is a classic in my family and should definately be one in yours. If you don't know the fear of a triple dog dare or the embarrassment of a young boy in a bunny suit you are MISSING OUT! It just isn't the holiday season without this movie. This film features great performances from Peter Billingsly as young cynic Ralphie, who only wants one thing for Christmas: A Red Rider BB Gun and Melinda Dillon as the American mom not to mention the father and Ralphie's hysterical little brother (""Show Mommy how the piggies eat!""). It also makes great use of the 'Peter and the Wolf' symphony. The film just stands out as a holiday classic because it's nostalgic air is so realisticly dreamy. There are charming and understanding moments (when the Mom sticks the soap in her mouth comes to mind) and all of Ralphie's daydreams are whimsical childhood fantasies.

413019,5,6301966554,"This movie remains so fresh with each viewing, it is easy to forget that it is almost twenty years old.  Told from Ralphie's viewpoint, these are the Christmas reminiscences of an adult whose pre-teen Christmas wish is a BB-gun that adults discouraged with the phrase ""You'll shoot your eye out.""
In his quest to convince his parents that he is old enough to have a BB-gun, young Ralphie hatches several plots, including writing the best ""What I Want for Christmas"" essay in his class, being leaving BB-gun ads in conspicuous places, and, as a last resort, asking Santa Claus. (Parents with young sons, beware: you may want to delay purchasing this film until you are ready to deal with a similar request.)
Told in episodic fashion, there are many vignettes which stand out: Ralphie wearing Aunt Martha's Christmas present, visiting Santa Claus and helping his father change a flat-tire come to mind immediately.  Exaggerated acting, distorted camera angles, and day-dream sequences all enhance the child's viewpoint, but do not detract from the film's excellent portrayal of 1950's small-town Christmas ritual.
Melinda Dillon and Darren McGavin have a tongue-in-cheek style as Ralphie's parents.  Peter Billingsley has just the right pre-teen balance between adorable and obnoxious, and Ian Petrella is downright irritating as baby brother Randy.  Among the smaller roles, Zack Ward is perfect as the clay-footed bully and Tedde Moore excellent as Ralphie's kind, but practical teacher.  (Jean Shepherd, the author and narrator of the film makes a cameo appearance standing in line, waiting for Santa.)
This is one to enjoy each Christmas.",1008028800,55,1640,5.244274809160306

413041,5,6301966554,"Think back to those Christmases from your childhood ... Isn't there one that stands out in your memory as the ""Christmas to end all Christmases""?  You wanted a particular toy more than anything, more than life itself.  You did everything in your power to ensure its delivery, behaving in your most responsible mature way, making sure Santa knew about it (you had your doubts about Santa, but you wanted to hedge your bets).
Such is the premise for ""A Christmas Story.""  Peter Billingsley as Ralphie gives a sterling performance, a perfect combination of childhood naivete' and more mature observation.  Darrin McGavin is wonderful as Ralphie's dad, ""the old man,"" exuding boyish joy while at the same time trying to act like a ""father.""  The only casting choice that I questioned was Melinda Dillon as Ralphie's mother -- she does a fine job, though, and in the end is a nice match for Darrin McGavin.
The story is narrated by Jean Shepherd himself, in a sort of midwest-accented Tom Bodette or Garrison Keillor style.  It works beautifully, lending a sort of sepia-toned nostalgic tone to the story.
If you're looking for a replacement (or addition) to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" this is a good candidate.  It's funnier (the Bumpus's worthless pack of bloodhounds almost steal the show a couple of times), and (I feel) more realistic -- something the entire family can enjoy!",1007596800,3,1374,4.896551724137931

This isn't top-notch DVD quality, but still better than TNT's, despite digital DVD technology.
About the movie: some of the same sound effects and accompanied songs are heard at least twice in this film.  If you listen closely, you'll notice the repetition.  And as for the language, FYI, the old man says ""cripes"" every time (thank goodness).  Of course, who can forget the undecipherable phrases he blurts out  when he attacks the furnace, hehe.  Listen more closely and you can also discover some dub-overs made throughout the film.  Aside from the ""B"" word used a couple times, this film isn't too bad languagewise, but lots of phrases sound like garbled recordings.  (Example: the old man said ""Not A Finger!"" because he didn't want the mother to lay her hands on his broken, plastic lamp.)
I should be ashamed to say this, but when I was a kid, the Santa portrayed in this movie used to get me excited for Christmas Eve when he would go down the chimney and deliver presents.  Now, I realize that's not what Christmas is about.  It's about celebrating the joy of our Lord, and loving one another.",1007510400,2,1240,4.595454545454546

413045,5,6301966554,"There are very few movies which I can honestly say qualify as my ""favorites."" Even fewer among Christmas-themed movies. But ""A Christmas Story"" is certainly one of them.
Why? Because I laughed as much watching it the 23rd time as I did the first. Because I can watch it every year and never get sick of it. Because I enjoy it as much now as I did as a kid (although for different reasons).
The genius of this movie is its simple, heartfelt story and loveable characters. Every character seems to remind you of people you really know. You can relate to them and the story they're living. Who doesn't remember wishing and begging for that one must-have present?! And how exciting it was to open it up and see that you *actually* got it?!
Who doesn't have parents who do things that are more-than-slightly embarrassing? Or whom you admired and feared at the same time as a kid? Or have a pesky brother, sister, cousin, or would-be friend who just wouldn't leave you alone? Or ever get pushed around by the school bully? (Unless you were the school bully, that is.)
This movie is superb in that it appeals to all audiences. There is no violence, no blood-and-guts, no tragedy or trauma. There isn't even foul language -- although you'd think so with all the huffing-and-puffing the Old Man does. If you listen carefully, you'll notice that not one swear word is used in this movie -- only words that *sound* like swear words. Example: When the Old Man gets mad at Mother for ""accidentally"" breaking his Major Award and then ""using up all the glue"" -- he shouts ""Nottafingga!!"" Not really a word, is it?! But it sure sounded pretty bad!
Over the years I have grown fond of the movie's characters, and I look forward to watching it every year and ""visiting"" with Ralphie, Randy, Mother, the Old Man -- even nasty Scut Farcus!!

413047,5,6301966554,"""A Christmas Story"" has been a part of my holiday tradition for the last ten years. This movie puts me in the Christmas spirit year-round! All Ralphie Parker wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. Ah, if life were that simple. His 1940's Midwest family is humorously dysfunctional: his father stumbles around yelling garbled curses at the malfunctioning furnace and worshipping ""The Leg Lamp,"" his little brother Randy is an annoying nuisance whose sole ability seems to be whining, and all the grownups in his life don't take him seriously. Throw in some school bullies, a wild imagination, and plenty of Christmas spirit, and you end up with the wonderful mix that is ""A Christmas Story."" Every year my family will gather around the TV, with a fire in the fireplace and glasses of eggnog. We usually watch this at least three times a year: after Thanksgiving, on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day. There is something magical about returning to the trials and tribulations of childhood, of the yearning and pleading and begging after that one Christmas gift that you HAVE to have, the sacred ritual of visiting Santa Claus at the mall, choosing that perfect Christmas tree (even if it ends up looking like Charlie Brown's), that first magical snowfall, the whole family decorating the tree, waiting for Santa and finally running down the stairs about as quietly as an elephant on Christmas morning in the quest to be the first to unwrap the presents in a frenzy of knotted ribbons and flying wrapping paper (hopefully NOT finding a pink bunny costume like poor Ralphie). This is a gentle, heartwarming, humorous tale of Christmas. It is rated PG due to minor swear words (and a narrowly averted major swear word)... and an imaginary shootout with BB guns.

413112,5,6301966554,"One memorable Christmas in the life of a nine-year-old in 1940's Indiana makes for a memorable movie and reflections on the innocence of youth in ""A Christmas Story,"" directed by Bob Clark and starring young Peter Billingsley, Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon.  What is happiness?  To young Ralphie Parker (Billingsley), it's simple; it's getting the best Christmas present a boy could ask for, namely a genuine Red Ryder 200-shot carbine action air rifle BB gun.  But it's getting close to the big day, and his hopes are fading fast; there's an obstacle between him and the coveted weaponry:  Mom (Dillon).  And the answer is ""No.""  But why!?  ""You'll shoot your eye out.""  Reasoning and wisdom to which there is simply no argument.  But, as Yogi once said, ""It ain't over till it's over,"" and a determined Ralphie refuses to give in or give up on his quest for the ultimate gift.  And as the story unfolds we get a glimpse, through Ralphie's eyes, of the way life was in another time and another place; an era long since gone, but never forgotten.  Based on a portion of the Novel ""In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash,"" by Jean Shepherd, with a screenplay by Shepherd, Leigh Brown and Bob Clark, Shepherd narrates (as the adult Ralphie), with reminiscences that are poignant and delightful; about Dad (McGavin), an Oldsmobile man, turkey lover and fabled ""furnace fighter,"" who in the heat of battle could weave a tapestry of profanity that as far as anyone knows is still hanging in the air somewhere over Lake Michigan; Mom, a woman who hadn't had a hot meal in years, thanks to tending to the needs of her family first; younger brother Randy (Ian Petrella); friends Flick (Scott Schwartz) and Schwartz (R.D. Robb) who share Ralphie's myriad adventures and set the protocol of the ""dare,"" from the singular all the way up to the coup de grace, the ""triple dog dare,"" employed during a contest to determine, once and for all, if one's tongue will in fact stick to a frozen metal flag pole; the endearing Miss Shields (Tedde Moore), the teacher who makes them write a THEME; and last, but not least, the yellow-eyed neighborhood bully, Scott Farcus (Zack Ward) and his toadie, Grover Dill (Yano Anaya), who give new meaning to the phrase, ""Say Uncle!""  There are humorous anecdotes about flights of fancy and lessons in life, like how to change a tire in record time and how to barter for the right Christmas tree (from Dad), and tricks used to get your younger brother to eat his food instead of just playing with it, as well as alternative uses for soap (from Mom).  We also discover how Ralphie learned a valuable lesson about how the journey is often the best part of the goal finally realized (courtesy of a ""Little Orphan Annie"" secret decoder ring), and the real meaning of a ""Major Award.""  McGavin is perfectly cast as Ralphie's dad, ""The Old Man,"" as he is referred to affectionately, and he gives just the right touch to all of the small ironies of life that seem to surround him, while Dillon gives a winning performance as his mom, whose TLC nurtured the warm memories from which this story was born.  But the most exemplary performance given here is by Peter Billingsley, who forever after will remain Ralphie Parker in the memories of anyone who sees this film.  There is an engaging naturalness about him that makes an instant connection with the audience, for he personifies the child in all of us, and it's a character you'll remember for as long as you retain any memories of your own childhood.  And therein lies the real charm of this movie; because everyone was once a child, and for better or worse, will carry memories akin to Ralphie Parker's (or Jean Shepherd's) forever.  A heartwarming, funny film, ""A Christmas Story"" is a true classic that can be enjoyed again and again and will most likely become an annual event once you've experienced it.  In the tradition of ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" and ""A Christmas Carol,"" this is a movie that can add so much to the festivities, no matter how you celebrate your holidays.",976665600,11,4047,4.690677966101695
413113,5,6301966554,"I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it.  It's one of the first videos I ever bought.  This movie has captured how it feels to be a kid--dealing with bullies, friends' dares, little brothers, Christmas anticipation, teachers, broken glasses, disappointments, and fear of your dad when you're in trouble.  Some things never change, I guess.  I love Ralph's daydreams, his whiny little brother Randy who won't eat unless he can be a pig, and the pink bunny pajamas from Ralph's aunt Clara who ""had for years not only perpetually labored under the delusion that [Ralph is] 4 years old, but also a girl.""
Oh Fudge, wash my mouth out with soap (but please don't use LifeBouy)!  There are a few bad words in the movie, but not many.  It's limited to a couple of S.O.B.'s and a couple of smart-a**es.  Most of the bad language in the movie is simulated.  Because Ralphie's father swears all the time, Ralphie learns to swear.  I think that is a good lesson for everyone.  And who has not at least wanted to beat up a bully?
As a mother, I can understand the ""irrational prejudice against Red Ryder and his Peacemaker"".  What I can't understand is the few people with irrational prejudice against this movie.  It's just as cute as can be.  See it with your family.  I think just about everyone will enjoy it.",976492800,5,1310,4.542735042735043

While some parts of the movie were humorous I must admit, the movie as a whole was dark and mean. Swearing is glorified, as well as the violence. I watched through this movie before allowing my kids to see it, and I decided this was not a movie to let them see at their age. This movie does have it's followers, but you must see that this film is not one that young children should be seeing. Santa Claus is also portrayed as sinister, which kids will not understand and could be potentially traumatizing. I'm afraid to say that I did not like this movie. I do not believe that it should be considered a classic like Miracle on 34th Street. If anything, it should be a time waster for older, more mature teens.

413126,5,6301966554,"Some families make a ritual of watching ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""Miracle on 34th Street"" each holiday season.  Not ours; our top choice is this hilarious view of one Christmas season in Ralphie's life, as seen retrospectively by him as an adult.
  More a series of picaresques in the life of a little boy who wants a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas than a full storyline, it takes us on a journey through childhood, going from the little brother who must be allowed to eat like a pig to eat at all, to the town bullies and their continual harrassment, to the father who wins a ""valuable prize"" one day in a newspaper puzzle contest.  Throughout, Ralphie is plotting ways to still get the gift of his dreams, the Red Ryder--""you'll shoot your eye out""-- BB gun.
  Part of the charm of this film is the narration of Ralphie as an adult looking back on part of his childhood, but it also has many universal themes that are so common to kids, no matter what era.  The bullies, the longing for a seemingly unattainable thing, the playground dares, the constant daydreaming--all these are presented in an entertaining fashion that still causes us to think, ""Yeah, I remember that.""  Our kids are watching this and saying, ""That is just like when I...""

413130,5,6301966554,"Now I have to stick up for Jamie a bit.  She was honest that she did not like the movie but her family did, and she said you love it or hate it.  I love it.
My main problem is these parents writing reviews because it has ""violence and profanity"".  First of all, they were looking for offensive material in this movie; no cussing of any kind was in this movie except for the one time Ralphie says the ""F"" word, which is extended by him into the word fudge in front of his father.  You actually cannot even hear the complete word.  The idea is you know what he said and his mother (which I'm sure some of the mothers with their reviews felt was also wrong) promptly washes out his mouth with soap.  Also, with the mother who felt that this is a bad movie with the gun violence these days, the movie was made in 1983 and guns don't kill people, people kill people.  You can smother someone with a pillow and it doesn't mean it's the pillow's fault.
To everyone this is a very cute movie that will make a good portion of you laugh and smile.  Obviously from the other comments the DVD quality is poor but the VHS is just fine.  Not everyone will like this movie, but I hope you do not look at it to raise your children.  That is your job alone to teach your children cussing is bad, guns are not toys, and fighting is wrong, but sometimes you don't have a choice.  That is what this movie was stating.  Ralphie got in a fight because he really had no other choice so he fought to win.  His father yells in the movie and you are to take it as cussing, but you can never understand what he says.  The Santa and the elves seem mean because that is how Ralphie pictures them, as big, mean, scary people.  You have to admit they tend to scare children in real life.

I  love it's more down-to-earth look at the yuletide season, showing the  shortcomings as well as the virtues. And what better viewpoint to see it  from than that of a ten-year-old with high hopes?
Sure it's set in the  late 40's, but it does have many elements of timelessness. Things like  taking stupid dares at recess. Facing down the overbearing schoolyard  bully. Those endless hints about what you want for XMas- just to be  somewhat discouraged by your parent's less-than-enthusiastic reaction.  Formulating a foolproof plan to get exactly what you want on that magical  day. That god-awful get-up that your distant (But apparently not distant  enough) aunt sent you that your folks make you put on so they can take  Holiday pictures. Learning the art of cussin' from your dad's mad tirades  of indignation. It's those little moments in the film and in life that most  of us recall from our childhood days in mid-December.

413160,5,6301966554,"Just a quick note to ""Jamie"" who hates this movie--how can you possibly recommend that our children watch and subsequently enjoy the R-rated ""Roger and Me"" but thoroughly trash this wonderful  movie?  There's only one cuss word uttered throughout the entire course of  this film, and what person on this planet hasn't been moved to utter  something very similar when faced with the same type of utter  disappointment that Ralphie was? CHILL OUT!
Now, on to the main  attraction: this is one gem of a Christmas-time, family-oriented movie!  Perfectly cast and acted, beautifully filmed and expertly representing the  1940's of the Midwest, Jean Shepherd's wonderfully comedic remembrances of  his early Christmas experiences really come to life on the big screen.  Darren McGavin and Melinda Dillon are absolutely perfectly cast as the  typical 40's Mom and Dad.  They're spousal jousting is hilarious and a  wonder to behold, yet may ring very true with our own memories of dear old  Mom and Dad, while Peter Billingsly and Ian Petrella fit together really  nicely as the combative/frustrated/competitive siblings.  It's all here,  told in funny, touching and often hilarious ways; the ""I dare  you"" friends, the despair of having the write a ""theme"" in  class, the scarey walk home as you watch for and hopefully miss an  encounter with the neighborhood bully, the wonder and excitement of  listening with rapt attention to the radio programs of the day, and of  course, the tremendous build-up and anxious waiting for ""The Day""  to arrive!  This fine film will conjure up those wonderful memories of  Christmas when we were kids, no matter what the generation or the decade.  The cheerful, hopeful glee that all children have when it comes to  Christmas-time is so beautifully and hilariously represented here that you  will still be enjoying your favorite moments long after the final credits  have run.

413161,4,6301966554,"And so it happens that the media moguls have conspired once again to recreate yet another of our national traditions:  the annual reprise of a motion picture that has been blessed and certified by the entertainment  industry as a ""classic.""  Only rather than let the test of time  determine what films are worthy of this especial classification, it is  instead forced down our throats with unrelenting promotional hype and  non-stop broadcasting, as is frequently done with ""A Christmas  Story"" on any of several Ted Turner-infected stations.  But this time,  the moguls got it right.
""A Christmas Story"" is fast becoming a  Christmas tradition, where families gather around the television to enjoy  the warm sentiments and precise humor that decorate this film much as they  would gather around the Christmas tree to open presents.  And the reason is  simple.  ""A Christmas Story"" brings us back in touch with our  youth and the time of our life when we could daydream, feel carefree and  unbridled.  I have never seen another film that so perfectly captures the  unassuming, innocent imagination of a child and portray it on screen.  Who  cannot relate to little Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) and his desire for a  Red Rider BB gun?  We all felt the same way at one time or another for the  toy we had our own hearts set on, and the bitter disappointment when our  mother gave us her own rendition of ""You'll shot your eye  out.""
Jean Shepherd's heartwarming tale is filled with hysterical  anecdotes and memorable characters like the father (Darren McGavin) and his  ""tapestry of obscenities that, as far as we know, is still floating in  space over Lake Michigan.""  Don't worry, his ""obscenities""  are mumbled and indiscernible.  And the scene with Ralphie and Santa Claus  in the shopping mall is so side-splittingly funny that I would urge you  refrain from drinking beverages while watching it.  One slightly  disappointing observation was the lack of anything religious or suggestive  of Christmas' true meaning anywhere in the film.

The father's mumbled obscenities as he descends into the basement  to make non-stop adjustments to the coal furnace damper is a classic. That  alone is worth the price of the movie. McGavin (the Dad) must have  practiced that bit for months. That man has a gift.
And when Ralphie says  ""the *f* word"" - his mother demands to know where he learned such  vile language. The answer he wants to say is - ""from Dad,"" but  instead, he gives up a friend as the culprit and the scene that follows is  so very funny.

But the reason I remember  the film is the way that it takes the basic stuff of childhood (the  viciousness of your best friends, the intrinsic annoying-ness of you  siblings, the trench warfare that parents and chilren and husbands and  wives wage on a daily basis) and tweaks it just enough to make it funny.  There isn't a plot as such--little Ralphie Parker dreams of getting a Red  Ryder BB-gun for Christmas, and this is the thread on which Bob Clark (who  also directed) and Jean Shepherd (on whose novel IN GOD WE TRUST--ALL  OTHERS PAY CASH the film is based) string a series of vignettes about  Ralphie's friends and family, from poor Flick getting his tongue stuck to a  frozen pole to Mom ""accidentally"" breaking the woman's-leg lamp  that Dad won in a contents and insists on displaying in the front window.  The film is also helped by the pitch-perfect casting; Darren McGavin as The  Old Man, all raging, frustrated id, Melinda Dillon as Mother, a sweet,  rational woman in general, but given to moments of eccentric outrage, and  Peter Billingsly as Ralphie--a marvelous combination of unaffected  youthfulness and shrewd comic timing (you can believe that this kid would  grow up to be somebody smart like Jean Shepherd).
And best of all,  despite the wonderful period details in the sets and costumes, this isn't a  nostalgic film; the script and the performances always cut the sugar with  plenty of vinegar--which makes the whole thing that much tastier . . .",946080000,6,1754,4.731788079470198
413182,5,6301966554,"I watch this every christmas. It is hilarious. More of an adult christmas movie, kids will not get some of the humor. Especially between the parents.",945820800,2,149,4.769230769230769
413183,5,6301966554,"Personally I think this is the antithesis of how a child feels about Christmas!  And being from a child's point of view, why it is precious!  It never failed, whatever I wanted my parents, teachers, etc, etc, etc thought  it was unnecessary or just plain out dangerous.
The first time I saw this  movie, I was skeptical.  My mother told me I'd love it and anytime she  tells me that, I usually squirm away in horror.  But she was right!  This  movie makes me belly laugh about so many things!  And Flick... What a  dunderhead!  Who'd put his tongue on a frozen flagpole!
I love the  whole movie down to the Bumpass's dogs and the stolen Turkey episode to the  ""Butterfinger"" to the gruesome Santa!  And that teacher makes  Cruella DeVille look like a saint!",945734400,5,757,4.496296296296296
413184,2,6301966554,"I've seen this movie every Christmas at my relative's house. I can honestly say I hate it. I've been searching for reasons why people actually think of this is as a classic up there with It's A Wonderful Life and A  Charlie Brown Christmas. Pretty much the same excuse of every person who  has seen this is that it reminds them of their childhood. I cannot contend  that. However, I think the movie is actually pretty mean-spirited and after  awhile pretty bland. In one sequence we have Ralphie uttering the F word  and then beating up this one kid to a bloody pulp (with his mittens!) Then  you have the scene where that one kid gets stuck to the pole with his  tounge. They seriously should have gotten Roald Dahl to direct this movie!  Not much of an ending either. He does get the BB gun however. Stick with  It's a Wonderful Life for your Christmas viewing pleasures.",945475200,9,873,4.474683544303797

I rarely laugh out loud, but this story made me laugh repeatedly.  I loved the main  character, Ralphie, but even more I loved the way the story was told  through Ralphie's thoughts.  It was pure fun.  I've watched it many times  already, and plan to watch it every Christmas.",944956800,4,404,4.293333333333333

From the big snow suit on the little brother, to the kid sticking his tongue on the pole, this is it.  I saw it for the  first time in the theatre when it first came out and from then I was  hooked.  Watch it with a bunch of people and remember.  But careful, you  might ""put your eye out""!",944956800,,392,3.8860759493670884

The whole month he tries to  persuade his parents to get it for him, while at the same time dealing with  his annoying little brother, avoiding the town bully, and constantly  dreaming of owning the red ryder.

It is fun, and really quite humorous.  The late  Jean Shepherd wrote a masterpiece in this movie, and he was excellent as  the narrator -- reminiscent of The Waltons, only funny.  It's a holiday  classic that should be in the video library of every family.  To listen to  sound clips from this movie, go to wilstar.com/xmas.",944265600,,496,4.4222222222222225
413213,4,6301966554,"I'm no movie critic, so my review won't be profound nor long. This movie is truly wonderful in its truth and simplicity.  I am a fifty-one year old man who grew up geographically, culturally, and time-period wise, parallel  with Ralphie, the central character and 1st person narrator of the movie.  And, I remember well what it was like to be nine years old then and there.  The pain, the fears, the frustrations, the unknowingness, the dreams and  hopes are all so real yet so incredibly funny.  Anyone who has livied  within a large family will recognize the Xmas scenes where the neighborhood  dogs enter the house and carry away the Xmas turkey and how the family is  forced to have Xmas dinner in a Chinese restaurant with the restaurant  staff attempting to sing Xmas carols with their delightfully funny Chinese  accent.  Culturally, in the midwest in the late forties and early fifties,  only a Chinese restaurant could be found open in a small midwest town on  Xmas Day.
I recommend this movie to anyone who ever was a young boy or  who knows a young boy.  It is delightful!",944265600,,1083,4.650793650793651
413214,5,6301966554,"I watch this movie and I am somewhere between 7 and 9 years old. The charm, warmth and humor of this movie is the key. I can here my parents arguing over the tree. Who cooked the best turkey. Who let the dog in the  house. Who messed with the furnace. (We had a nasty one you continually had  to go push the reset button and as a kid it was scary. As an adult I still  fear that furnace.) I wanted Hop a Long Cassidy Holster and a BB gun. I got  the holster, my cousin got the BB gun, afterall he was a boy.

413235,5,6301966554,"This is quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.  My holiday season officially begins the first time I watch ""A Christmas Story"".  The movie features wondefully comedic writing, especially in  the very effective narrative framework as Peter Billingsley's character  ""Ralphie"", now grown, describes the events and characters leading  up to the Christmas he receives his first Red Ryder BB Gun, the highlight  of his young life.  Darren McGavin is hilarious as Ralphie's dad, and  everytime I see ""Kenny"" on ""South Park"" I think of the  little brother all bundled up in his snowsuit and parka trying to keep up  with the big boys.  It's a wonderful family movie.  Anyone who watches it  can see a piece of their own childhood in the film--the Bumpas' dogs, the  bully Scott Farkas, the admonition that a toy will ""shoot your eye  out.""  It's beautiful.  Watch, rent, buy this movie.  You won't regret  it.  And don't take any triple dog dares involving flag poles!",943920000,17,971,4.913043478260869

413240,3,6301966554,"I bought this DVD version hoping that the transfer would be of a somewhat higher quality than the former MGM DVD release.  Unfortunately, it looks like they may have simply taken the pan and scan version that Turner owns  (the Turner logo is prominently featured) and runs each year on TBS, and  simply cleaned the video and sound up a bit.
The video quality is fairly  clean (no obvious scratches, dirt, hair lines, etc) and the sound is clear,  but at times sounds like a slightly warped record (wavy notes).
In the  area of supplements, the DVD comes only with alternate languages,  subtitles, and the theatrical trailer.
This transfer is obviously not  taken from the original print, and it's a shame, because it deserves it.  The title, however, is worth the money regardless.  The price is fair, and  if a souped-up version is released in the future, it won't be for a year or  two.  In the meantime, given its price point, it's a good buy for those who  love the movie.",940204800,4,976,4.598837209302325

Wouldn't it  have been neat when we were all kids and went to see Santa Clause if there  was a slide to slide down like the one in the movie?I just thought I would  mention it.
