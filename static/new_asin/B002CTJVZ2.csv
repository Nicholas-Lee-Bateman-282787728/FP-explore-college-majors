3907186,5,B002CTJVZ2,"I was very fortunate to be able to see TULPAN at a small movie theatre (rather than DVD) so that I could enjoy it with a few dozen other folks.  But it will play just as well on a wide-screen TV (the bigger the better, though)...because it is in many ways a travelogue.  A skewed, touching and somewhat haunting one...taking you to a place you know you don't want to go.  Seeing it with a group, I felt as though we were on some kind of slow moving tour bus, allowing us to visit the stark land of Kazakhstan.  If you saw it alone, no doubt you'd feel like a lone traveler, beating up your car's suspension and working hard to keep your car on track in the wind.  TULPAN is the most tiny and intimate of films...yet has almost deliriously expansive panoramas of a land that is as forbidding as any depicted on screen.

Young Asa has recently returned home from his service in the Navy.  He comes from a family of hard-scrabble sheep herders on the Steppes of Kazakhstan.  He is a vibrant, easy-going and slightly dimwitted young man.  His burning desire is to have his own herd, but this will not be granted to him until he marries.  There is pretty much only one eligible young lady in his sparsely populated corner of the world, and even though he has never even seen this girl (named Tulpan), because she holds the key to his happiness, he feels he is in love with her.  She declines his offer, ostensibly because she doesn't like his big ears.  The real reason may be that she wants a life in the city, perhaps with an education.  Asa loves the harsh land that has been his only home, and he yearns to own his own way there.  You have no doubt that he would treat this girl well and give her a ""traditionally happy"" life...because he clearly has no malicious bone in his body.

Asa is undaunted in his efforts.  While he schemes to win Tulpan's agreement, he lives with his sister and her family, which includes 3 children and an older, grumpy husband.  Asa tries to help out on the farm, but he's so eager to please, he can't help but trip over his own feet, so to speak.  He fails to endear himself to his brother-in-law, who also urgently wants Asa out of the house.

And that's about it for the plot.  I won't kid you; TULPAN is a slow moving film.  Very little that we would think of as earth-shattering happens.  Yet the movie accomplishes two very rare things, and thus it continues to resonate with me more than a month after I saw it.

First, Asa and his family feel 100% real.  They feel NOTHING like most people you and I are ever likely to know...but we immediately understand and empathize with all of them.  Whether it's the dutiful sister & wife, who wants only harmony in her family, and clearly loves all the people in her life with great intensity or the pre-teen daughter whose only distraction is to sing to herself...constantly and loudly.  Asa himself is all heart and little brain...yet you'd be hard-pressed to find a more decent, open & sincere a person.  And none of them feel like actors (they aren't pros)...we actually feel like we're spending time living with these folks.  Seeing and EXPERIENCING their everyday lives of tending to their yurt and their sheep.

Second, and perhaps most stunningly, we get a true sense of PLACE.  The cinematography is simple yet stunning.  Kazakhstan, to my eyes, is a stark place with little obvious beauty.  But we get to glimpse it through Asa's eyes from time to time, and are able to see how HOME can be a beautiful place to the person who feels at home there...not matter what everyone else sees and feels.  And there are long, lingering shots of the land and the people and animals on it.  One stunning scene I will try to describe:  the shot involves a still camera, which at first shows us the side of a building, some fencing and mostly a path leading out onto the bleak steppes (the land looks like you'd imagine dust-bowl America to have looked).  We hear sounds of approaching animals.  Sure enough, sheep move into the picture and off into the distance, followed by dogs, donkeys, men, children, poultry and so on.  The camera never moves, and nothing really happens except that the various ""life forms"" pass by us.  Yet we get such a clear understanding of their relationships and importance to each other.

TULPAN has moments of GREAT humor (one scene involving a camel is particularly hilarious) and sometimes touching drama (you've never thought the birth of a lamb could be so dramatic).  But I'll say again...it isn't a story where the traditional idea of a plot is all that important.  Yes, things happen to Asa, and the issue of Tulpan is resolved.  But the real pleasures of TULPAN will come if you simply allow yourself to be immersed in the life the film wants to show you.  It's a harsh and alien life...but if ever a movie showed an American audience how much more ALIKE we all are than DIFFERENT...TULPAN is it.

When I started to write this review, I was thinking 4-stars.  But as I wrote and remembered...I understood that for me, this film really is 5-stars.  Perhaps the most quiet, understated 5-star film I've ever reviewed...but it is a movie that I think will always come back to me over the years as being not quite like anything else I've ever seen.",1254182400,12,5255,4.500527983104541
3907187,5,B002CTJVZ2,"Asa is a young Kazakh who, having completed his military service, wants to return home and become a sheep farmer. The problem is he must first be married and the only eligible woman within many miles, the shy and elusive Tulpan, is just not interested.

Celebrated Kazakh documentary filmmaker Sergey Dvorsevoy won the Prix Un Certain Regard at Cannes for this, his first dramatic feature. Astonishing in its simplicity and for its intimate depiction of rural life, the film is also surprisingly funny - a simple humor that is far removed from that of the more popular but utterly false portrayal of Kazakhstan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat/dp/B000MMMT9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat</a>.

The performances, mostly by individuals who had never acted before, are astonishingly genuine.  It's hard to believe they are playing a role, and that this is not a documentary.  Even more stunning is the authenticity of the scenes.  There is, obviously, no CGI here, and nothing is fake, but through patience Dvortsevoy was able to capture some surprising and exciting moments - a twister that appears suddenly in the midst of a confrontation between two characters, an angry camel mother attacking the vet who cares for her son, a sheep giving birth and a genuine performance of Asa's surprise and wonder and helplessness, all in a single take without cuts.  Lovers of great films should celebrate this deceptively simple and lovely film.",1247184000,29,1488,5.475982532751091
3907188,5,B002CTJVZ2,"Dense with the realism and light humor of daily existence, Tulpan at times has the feel of a documentary, yet it is a touching fictional tale about finding one's place in the world.

Asa returns from naval service and has expansive dreams of a free and prosperous life on the Kazakh steppe. For them to come true, his brother-in-law must give him a starter herd, he must find a wife in a desert devoid of humans, and he must earn his stripes as a herder. Asa is impatient, does not fit in, and seems powerless to realize his dreams. When he is pushed to the brink, ready to give up on his dream, he has a transforming experience of life and rebirth.

Dvortsevoy films with a patient eye (Tulpan took four years to film), turning the gritty landscape into a character in the film, helping to convey the utter isolation (but not hopelessness) of life on the barren steppe. This is a quixotic and delightful tale of self-discovery that offers a vivid look at what life is like in this secluded corner of the world.",1244764800,17,1174,5.109375
3907189,5,B002CTJVZ2,"This is a truly great film, a masterpiece to challenge Battleship Potemkin, Citizen Kane and The Lion King! Once you have seen this you will never be the same. I was deeply moved by the performances of all the actors, especially the camel and the donkey. I think the 2 scenes that affected me the most were the one where Comrade Boss was having the blackheads on his back squeezed out by his son, and the other was when the star was giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a still born lamb - masterpieces of the cinematographers art.
I can't wait to see more of this director's oeuvre. In the meantime, I am applying for Kazakstani citizenship. I too want to live in a Yurt with 150 emaciated sheep, one horny donkey and a camel surrounded by 200 kilometres of desert.",1300406400,,768,4.532374100719425

3907191,5,B002CTJVZ2,"So, normally I don't review something with over ten reviews (figuring that you readers already have enough information), but I love this movie, and so I'm going to share anyway! I first watched Tulpan when preparing to go on study abroad to Kazakhstan, and I have to say that I love the movie's characters, and its mixture of humor and realism, along with its reflections on life in Kazakhstan. Below is an extended review that I wrote for a class (I admit it!). There's one spoiler paragraph below that I've marked, but I hope you enjoy the rest and get a good sense of the movie.

~~~~~~~~~
""You didn't impress her,"" Asa is told after trying to charm Tulpan, a prospective wife living in Kazakhstan's countryside. Having recently worked for the Russian Navy, Asa moves to the steppe in the attempt to make a living as a herder, but must work for Ondas, the short-tempered husband of his sister Samal, until he finds a wife. As dust storms swirl and more and more lambs are stillborn, Asa still nurtures his dreams of becoming a wealthy rancher with Tulpan at his side.

In Tulpan (2008), director Sergei Dvortsevoy paints a picture of the challenges of life on the Kazakh steppe, including recurrent tensions of language, geography, family, and work in Kazakh culture.

Language and cultural difficulties plague Asa. As the film opens, he sits in a yurt, talking to his prospective in-laws about his experiences in the Russian Navy. As he uses Russian to describe how to bite an octopus in the right spot, his audience quickly tires. He returns to herding, which for him means running after and frightening the pregnant ewes in his care, even as his brother-in-law Ondas shouts after him, ""Jurme!,"" or ""Don't run!"" in Kazakh. The viewer discovers that Asa cannot speak Kazakh, and has no abilities in birthing lambs, watching sheep, or other skills necessary to be a herder. Asa's lack of cultural skill in persuading a bride or knowing how to work hard, as well as his lack of Kazakh language skills necessary to obey Ondas' instructions, lead to continued difficulties in communicating, and reflect wider tensions in Kazakh society involved in communications between urban Russian-speakers and rural Kazakh-speakers.

Asa also has difficulties with marriage: it is required in order for him to gain his own herd, but the one girl in the region, Tulpan (meaning ""Tulip""), is not forthcoming. But Asa persists, both in pursuit of Tulpan and of his chosen occupation. He returns to Tulpan's house again, and with his friend Boni pulls out all the stops to convince Tulpan and her family that he would be a good match: he has two arms and legs, and he's a prince, really, just like Prince Charles, but with smaller ears! This comical sketch illustrates the traditional practice of talking to a girl's parents rather than to the girl herself, even as the pictures of Prince Charles show an international sensibility.

Though the film is set in an arid location, the characters have larger connections, on both the national and international scale. Boni and Tulpan both talk about the city as the place to be, and even the littlest boy drives a turtle over the dusty ground like a car going to Almaty, the then-capital of the Kazakh Socialist Republic. In addition to the pictures of Prince Charles, we see Asa and Boni drive in a tractor with pornographic pictures of large-breasted women, and dawdle around reading magazine pictures depicting the high life of girls, motorcycles, and large houses. Modernity in Kazakhstan means the city, but Asa wants to have it all in his return to the countryside.

And yet Asa's big dreams don't seem to fit with anyone else's dreams. Boni, laughing and drunk, thinks Asa is foolish for trying to be a herder, Ondas thinks he can't make it, and Tulpan's parents indicate that she prefers to go to the city and get an education. Asa confronts her through a door, asking ""Are you enrolling in college? Which one? Is that your dream? Klassni! [Great!]"" But just after this compliment, he shows her the pictures of a yurt, a TV, and a farm that he has drawn on the underside of his sailor scarf -- a representation of his dream of becoming a wealthy herder. And then he tries to talk her out of her dream. The city is dangerous, he suggests, and she need not go to college; she can just take a correspondence course. His dreams center around himself, and in asking her to put her dreams second, this sketch offers an interesting counterpart to the pro-women stories told in Soviet times, in which a woman's career was worth attending to first.

More traditional gender roles are seen in other settings, especially in the increasing fights between Asa and Ondas. Asa is expected to watch the sheep but instead sits dreaming of his future life. He is incompetent in caring for the sheep, and the pregnant ewes continue to wander off and give birth to stillborns. As Ondas is under increasing pressure from the boss not to lose more lambs, he becomes angry at Asa and refuses to let him herd. Asa rankles at being treated as a child. Even after the boss gives them permission to move to better pasture, Ondas and Asa continue to fight. Samal is placed in the middle, trying to soothe over the men's anger at each other, as well as watch and manage the children. Interestingly, no other extended family is depicted, and little contact with neighbors is shown. Given the extensive networks of most families in Kazakhstan, this is a somewhat surprising distortion in the film.

(SPOILER Paragraph!)
The story ends in a somewhat ambiguous way. When Asa learns that Tulpan has left for the city, he intends to follow, giving up his dream of country herding for his dream of Tulpan. He returns in sadness to Ondas and Samal, who are packing up their house to move with the herds. After giving several of his Navy possessions to the children, we see that he has erased his pictures of steppe, farm, and TV from the back of his sailor scarf, and replaced them with a picture of a tulip, representing Tulpan. At the last possible minute, though, he turns around and joins his sister's family on the back of the truck. As a storm comes, they move with the herds.

Although this discussion is told primarily from the perspective of Asa, it reflects on broader tensions between the city and the countryside, between Russian and Kazakh language speakers, and between sticking with relatives and pursuing one's own dream. In a post-socialist era when every person is expected to provide for themselves, we see a narrative centered on isolated families and individuals, torn between sticking together and pursuing their own individual dreams. Asa emerges as an untimely sort of hero for his persistence and optimism.  Ultimately, making a living in rural areas seems to necessitate giving up on other dreams and banding together, as we see when Asa, Ondas, and Samal move off into their nomadic life together.

A post-note: One of my favorite moments in Kazakhstan this summer was when driving down the dusty, tree-lined streets of Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty. When my Kazakh driver flipped on the radio, out blared ""On the Rivers of Babylon,"" the same song used as a recurrent theme in Tulpan! I definitely felt like I had stepped out of the world of urban Asia, and back into the country scenes of Tulpan!",1284681600,2,7335,4.781373322809787
3907192,4,B002CTJVZ2,"In general, the average American is not fully knowledgeable about Eastern society's contribution towards film. China, Japan, Korea, and Iran have received much praise lately due to their notable efforts in the field of cinema. However, past dependant states of USSR have not had the glowing reception that they deserve, considering that their films have, as of late, usually been among the most distinguished foreign films. Kazakhstan was not wildly known for its entertainment till Borat came along, and changed everything for this country, not necessarily for the best. Though it wasn't a Kazakh film by any means, it garnered enough attention for the country to come under attention for filmgoers. In no way a film that Kazakhstan wants to be remembered by, for in reality it was never about the nation; since its release the country has long tried to distance itself with such absurd and mocking depictions. Many would like to look at Tulpan as a humanizing brutal portrait of the real Kazakhstan. This film may garner Kazakhstan respect in the world of cinema, and shed away the horrible influence of Borat from their culture.

Tulpan is the engaging tale of a discharged sailor, named Asa, who wants to fulfill his living of being a herdsman. To gain the livestock he needs to turn his dream in to reality, he needs to satisfy one condition: marry. This seemingly simple request is more difficult than it seems as single woman are very difficult to find in this hunger Steppe. The one girl he falls in love with and her family find a combination of anatomical and economical issues with him that render his dream to a momentarily halt. In the meantime, he lives with his sister, her much older husband, and her three kids.

The amazing fact about Tulpan is that it does not offer a herdsman's life as it is imagined in contemporary art. These are not strictly austere individuals who demand to be left alone from technology and the modern forms of lifestyle of the West. The film is set in modern times, and offers the ""gifts"" of western culture, such as motorcycles, cars, radio, and all other assortments that would seem naturally bereft from the Hunger Steppe. It's wildly humorous to watch these men who are occupied in traveling long distances of this nearly barren land, buying and selling food, and in the meantime listening to pop music and hanging snippets of Playboy on their van.

The main issue audiences will have with Tulpan is that with a length of a hundred minutes it says a lot without really saying a lot. This issue is more directed at the Western audience who, generally, are used to conventional Hollywood narratives. This film differs as its narrative sets out to achieve nothing other than presenting these individuals lives, with no attempt at creating an all too familiar fictional world. The film works simply because it presents the lives of these herdsman in a way that their actual counterparts would be proud of; the film is real, brutally honest, and provocative because it presents itself as a documentary without being one. Many critics have been baffled by the conditions of these characters, as esteemed critic Roger Ebert going as far as claiming the film to be ""[showing] such an unfamiliar world, it might as well be Mars."" Many Western audiences may find the film to be far removed from their civilization and expectations, and find this lifestyle hard to identify with. However, it must be stated that the film is not solely about these men and their exploits, but about their dreams, wishes, and harsh realities. We may not be able to fully identify with some of their actions, such as the brutal sheep birth, but their humanity shines through; humanity that makes these men and women not much different from us, though many of us may live in metropolises that would make the herdsmen's lifestyle seem remarkably simplified. However, I feel as if someone familiar with Eastern Culture, and Eastern film, may not find the conditions of these men as drastic as Ebert felt.

Tulpan's humor is cleverly instituted. The animals of these herdsmen, such as camels and donkeys, offer enough comedy and laughter that it overrides the tension between the human beings. They offer not a moment of comedy, instead shifting that responsibility to the creatures. Only God knows how much time the Director spent in trying to produce such funny squeals and scenarios from these animals. Tulpan does not entertain us, but it show how people live when life is stripped to its bear essentials. Asa's dream is simple: he wants to live the herdsman's life, but live it leisurely, with satisfaction, and without the presence of stress. Humanity cannot be more common in its interest.",1279238400,2,4709,4.8825
3907193,4,B002CTJVZ2,"Thru out the film, I kept wondering where they got these wonderful actors. Unlike other movies with a similar setting -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cave-of-the-Yellow-Dog/dp/B000KHX70S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Cave of the Yellow Dog""</a>&nbsp;or the even better&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Story-of-the-Weeping-Camel/dp/B0006FFRB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Story of the Weeping Camel""</a>&nbsp;- this seems to use trained actors. The director, in an interview at the official website for this film, calls them ""actors"". And they were new to this setting and had to learn to live the life of a sheepherders living in yurts.

However, the director has a special talent with non-actors, too. Many scenes included a young child of about 3 or 4 years old and several animals. The integration of them into the scenes were nothing less than perfect. There's a memorably funny scene with a veterinarian with a motorbike and sidecar - and a baby camel wrapped in bandages - and a large mother camel - that had me wondering how it could possibly have been filmed. I thought that several times, too, during the film.

The plot about the young man returned from a stint in the Russian navy trying to marry the only fair maiden around is actually the B-plot. And it's almost expendable. What turns out to be the A-plot is the young man's effort to prove a competent sheepherder to his stubbornly impatient brother-in-law. Our evesdropping on the life of this family living in a yurt with the camera patiently following the activities of the people was fascinating to me.

The scenes with the free-spirited family friend who has a tractor with a boombox playing loudly and girlie pictures hanging in the cab provided some of the most energetically fun scenes.

My interest flagged occasionally - usually at the marriage attempts - but the rest made the whole film worthwhile. Not as starkly beautiful as ""Weeping Camel"" or ""Yellow Dog"", but still striking, with a good story that the writer/director said mostly evolved during the filming, and some fine actors -- human and otherwise.",1278028800,,2185,5.612121212121212

The film certainly delivers a story of the extreme hardships as well as the immense beauty of living in such a region, much as you would expect, but allowing the film room to breathe rather than strictly imposing a storyline to be followed through, Sergey Dvortsevoy's film captures some remarkable moments of semi-documentary brilliance that attest even more strongly to the extraordinary nature of the region and the people who live there.

There's no question that life in the region is difficult.  Nevertheless, after completing his military service and despite the attractions of life in the city, Asa has come back to the Hunger Steppe of Kazakhstan to work, hoping to get married and herd a flock of sheep of his own, dreaming of establishing his own little paradise.  The reality is harder than he imagined, with there being only one eligible woman in the sparsely populated region, Tulpan, and she isn't impressed by Asa's tales of man-eating octopi and, unflattering comparisons to Prince Charles notwithstanding, finds his ears stick out a bit too prominently.  Living with his sister Samal, her husband Ondas and their family in a lone yurt tent in the vast, dusty wilderness of the steppe, the task of herding the sheep proves difficult for the young man, particularly as business is suffering from a serious outbreak of stillborn lambs.

The story touches on all the expected points of poignancy for the hardships endured, for the internal struggle to hold on to an unlikely dream or whether to head for the unknown of the city and most likely never amount to anything there either.  The sense of desperation within Asa is fully felt in his heartfelt pleas to the parents of Tulpan, for without a wife he has no hope of gaining a herd of sheep of his own from the bossman - and the acting, from professional and non-professional actors alike is simply superb.  What is even more remarkable than the story however is the photography that is alert to the small details of living on the steppes, picking out the sense of isolation in the vastness of the region and the sheer power of the forces that have to be contended with there through 360-degree turns of the camera and several long takes, capturing with almost documentary precision the miracle of life in the region.",1274659200,,2989,5.686098654708521
3907196,3,B002CTJVZ2,"""On the Rivers of Babylon"" by BoneyM, a hit in the USSR of the last century seventies combined with returned marine's stories indicates a clear timing of the movie, coherent with its producer's birthday surely.

Plot: after compulsory navy service twenty two year old returned to his native bush/steppe to live with a sister's family in a yurt, which affected family's intimacy substantially, resulting into both tensions arising and a pressure to move out with own wife he was desperate to woo somehow.
Not so much eligible virgins live around, roughly speaking, just one, Tulpan (Tulip in English) does, he never saw but played imaginary games with as parents of her were not blessing a traditionally semi-arranged marriage.
Young man should choose between a traditional loyalty to family obligations and friendship with easy-living fellow coaxing him into moving to a city but a native land attraction won and a character remained where he was, in a dirt of the Kazakhstan steppe with sister and her sex-hungry husband.

To a reviewer, this comedy of traditional family affairs and giving a birth sheep in need for assistance just a simplistic prelude and response to a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Borat/dp/B000MMMT9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Borat</a>&nbsp;tale sarcastically highlighting a huge room for a more recent Kazakh development as an independent state.

If something was good in this DVD, it is not a very small size of subtitles both contextually and technically-visually, but actors performing brilliantly a stupid parody on a better time.",1269302400,3,1604,5.619834710743802
3907197,5,B002CTJVZ2,"It has been quite a while since a film affected me as powerfully as Tulpan. It sort of seeps under your skin and makes you reflect about it, like chewing cud, or something. It is extremely naturalistic, with a rich density whose lyrical simplicity is drawn out through many special little moments and situations. These little scenes were like pearls on a string. Each one reveals so much about the character of the individuals involved, and the relationships between them. In the end, the sense of the ties that bind, and the sense of place and the strength of family life trump wanderlust. It is difficult to speak about this film in generalities. It would be easy to say it is about a young man in a lonely place who is dreaming of  getting a beautiful wife, and a flock of sheep of his own, and his own yurt, and his own children--but that is only part of what it is about. Other than a few technological tools of the 21 century such as a portable radio and a tractor, the pattern of life is rooted in the situations of the shepherds of the steppes of central Asia since the dawn of animal husbandry. You could show this film to a herdsman from 4000 years ago and they would probably have only a few questions. But the film is so much more than what you can say about the engine that drives the action forward. It's about relationships in a family, it's about quiet desperation, its about death and birth and sickness and hope. And these things are drawn out with a quiet sublimity, as if not much effort or contrivance went into them. How does this happen? I'm not sure you can write these kinds of things in a script. It's too psychologicaly honest and true--it's too emotionally complex. There are just so many choice moments. ""Man, I told you this is no cattle wagon!""

Take the father, who when we first see him, is attempting to broker a marriage for his brother-in-law--at first, he doesn't come across as much of a sympathetic fellow--but then, gradually, you see the different dimensions of his character emerge in different situations, and you see the things that are worrying him--frustrating him, and interfering with his needs, and he becomes an understandable and a very sympathetic figure. You understand what motivates him--and you begin to appreciate him. This is true for every character in the film. Even the Veterinarian, who has only a few lines, is a fascinating and complex figure. A film like this demonstrates the ability of film to get at the most difficult human moments that you can capture and communicate to others. It is simply a tremendous achievement. I hope these guys do more projects such as this.",1255305600,6,2636,4.618336886993603

I was wary that ""Tulpan"" might condescend to people who live pre-modern lifestyles. I was relieved that it doesn't. We see the lure of city life for people who live on the steppe, but Asa, who has experience of the modern world, just wants to be a herdsman, woo Tulpan, and gain the respect of Ondas. He's an earnest, nice guy. He seems to have attainable goals. But Tulpan's rejection throws a monkey wrench into his plans. Tulpan, the title character, plays only a small role in the film. Asa's difficulties finding a bride keep him with his sister's family a while longer, which creates conflict and opportunity for us to observe them.

While there is nothing patronizing about ""Tulpan""'s treatment of these people who live a simple life in the middle of nowhere, without electricity or running water, I got the impression that the film's purpose is partly to observe their way of life. The steppe is a remarkable landscape for its flatness and dust storms. The yurts, sheep, camels, and people are striking against such barrenness. We can't help laugh at the absurdity of their situation sometimes, but it's a gentle absurdity, and ""Tulpan"" laughs with its characters, certainly not at them. The viewer can easily slip into their skin. In Kazakh with optional English subtitles. The only bonus feature on the Zeitgeist 2009 disc is a theatrical trailer.",1254787200,5,2002,4.920118343195266

8364419,4,B002CTJVZ2,"I found this film interesting, mostly for the view of the life of a family of shepherds on the Steppes of Kazakhstan.  You wouldn't call it action-driven; there is a plot but it moves slowly, very much like life does there.  In the opening scene a young Kazkh fellow, Asa, is making a pitch to win the hand of the only girl in the area, Tulpan.  We never actually see Tulpan so it's interesting that the film bears her name.  The fellow is recently back from a stint in the navy, he wears his decorated uniform and he regales the parents with his naval exploits underwater, chiefly how to avoid being crushed by an octopus.  Tulpan is listening from behind a curtain and after her parents consult with her she refuses the fellow, saying that his ears are too big.

From here on we see his efforts to win her as it's necessary for him to have a wife if he is going to make it as a shepherd in the area.  He has a side-kick, a more worldly fellow with a wonderful face and gold teeth who urges Asa to forget the girl and go with him to the city.  This is about all there is to the plot but it's very nicely told.  Asa is staying with his sister, her husband and several small children in a yurt.  Much of the activity is in and around the yurt.  We see the family eating, sleeping, working and playing.  The young mother is quite lovely and one of the nicest scenes of the film shows her singing with the young girl. That and a scene with a veterinarian and a camel are worth the price of the whole show. There's also a memorable scene in which Asa delivers a baby lamb....whoa!  We see him playing with the lamb a few months later which is quite touching.

The film isn't as visually beautiful as a film about nomads in Mongolia....wish I could remember its name.  That featured a real family and native clothing and decorations that were so wonderful that I wanted to run off and live there.  This landscape is bleak, the inside of their home is dreary, their clothing is like poor western wear.  The head of the household is not a pleasant or attractive person to watch.  The kids and animals are great, though, and Asa and his buddy are fun.  This isn't a film for everyone but for those who have an interest in how people in a very different area of the world live, it's well worth watching.",1356652800,,2294,4.268518518518518
8364420,5,B002CTJVZ2,"I think what's most marvelous about Tulpan is how it communicates hope, even when life is hard and disappointing. This is one of those movies that's not about any one thing so much as it is about our human condition. The canvas feels big because what is small is taken seriously. The movie is a bit of a soup: pastoral comedy with a light seasoning of tragedy as well as some hints of epic. In my personal top ten.",1355875200,,414,4.253164556962025
8364421,5,B002CTJVZ2,"Every now and then, you can find a foreign film that is pure original, unique with its cultural difference, a departure from the normal.  This is one of those, and what stands out most is the setting, as far as you can see... a barren, flat, brown, dry landscape with swirling and fierce dust throughout.  And in the midst of this barren empty landscape is a homemade shack and a ton of sheep, along with some camels.  The place is Kazakhstan in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

Humor is sprinkled throughout this Kazakh, a young man returns from the navy and lives with his sister's family, that includes her husband.  He wants to become a sheepherder, but his brother-in-law says he must have a wife first.  He is rejected by a suitor, a girl that we do not ever see, Tulpan, whose complaint is that his ears are too big.  The parents do not see him as a good prospect.  But, he does have a vision that he wears on the back of his shirt collar.  Kazakh's big dream is to build a little corner of paradise like the place he is in.

Kazakh's friend is mildly humorous, with his ""what seems to be his only cd/tape in his jeep, and ironically, a very favorite of mine, Rivers of Babylon  by Boney M.  The song plays frequently.  He also has a passion for 36DD women as the posters indicate.

If you have a queasiness for animal birthing, beware, there is a very graphic scene of a lamb giving birth and with the help of Kazakh.  The scenery is not a beautiful sight, but what occurs on this landscape is fascinating.  The entire film is with an interesting, not often seen part of our world.  This film has garnered many awards at the Film Festivals.  See it for its originality....Rizzo",1343865600,,1686,4.401294498381877
8364422,3,B002CTJVZ2,"The Russian filmmaker Sergey Dvortsevoy had gained a reputation for documentaries, but in the 2008 TULPAN he tries his hand at fiction with this story set in Kazakhstan. After serving in the Russian Navy, Asa (Askhat Kuchinchirekov) returns to the Kazakh steppe, living with his sister (Samal Yeslyamova) and brother-in-law (Ondasyn Besikbasov) while he tries to court the only unmarried young woman within hundred of kilometres.

As a sort of documentary, TULPAN will be an interesting experience for viewers in the West, capturing the desolation of the Kazakh steppe and the hard work that herders there must do to eke out a living. Some of the younger characters feel the draw of the big city, whose modernity offers them an easier life than the dull steppe. As a linguist, I found that the film represented well the Russian-Kazakh code-switching common after the Soviet era, which only underscores how these people feel torn between two worlds. The arguable climax of the movie comes with Asa assisting the real-life birth of a sheep, which is depicted realistically so that the audience learns something, but thankfully not too graphically.

But as fiction, I am less impressed with the film. I get the feeling that Asa's pursuit of Tulpan was the centre of the original script, but was mostly set aside after Dvortsevoy decided to improvise much of the film. The result is a lack of substance outside the pure observation of traditional life. All in all, it's worth seeing once and you'll learn something, but it's no classic.",1338076800,,1532,5.003921568627451
8364423,5,B002CTJVZ2,"I totally agree with most of the reviewers that loved the film, so I am not going to repeat all the praise. I just want to add a strange element which I haven't found anyone else mentioning it (as yet) and which gives, possibly, one more interesting view of the story; unfortunately a sad view. The main character, Asa, has just returned home after completing his stint in the Russian navy. But, why the Russian navy? He is a Kazakh and Kazakhstan is a landlocked country. A sailor from a landlocked country, and even more so, a sailor from the steppe? Apparently Kazakhstan does have a Navy, but, according to ""Wikipedia"", this is limited to a small number of boats in the Caspian Sea, which is a lake; a huge lake but still a lake. So, why does the film have him serve in the Russian navy and posted in the far away Pacific ocean? There might be a military cooperation agreement between Russian and Kazakhstan but I haven't traced something like that on the Internet. Is Asa putting us on? Is this just an element like all his other tall stories about huge octopuses, etc? Is it just a subconscious wish? A wish to bring the water element into the arid steppe? Of course, another element to tie in with this water theme is his friend's, Boni, favorite song: ""By the rivers of Babylon"".

The film is set in a steppe, without much water around. Animals are suffering because of the arid conditions but the two main characters are associated with water symbols. Well, symbolisms for water abound and they are generally associated with water as source of life; however, the film doesn't point to a very optimistic future for this traditional way of life. If Tulpan is the only suitable bride left in the steppe and she is going away, this society is finished. A pessimistic ending in a film that is definitely more upbeat than indicated by all these comments. It is an achievement for Dvortsevoy, the director, that he can present this dead-end in an uplifting, sympathetic and often oddly funny way.",1328832000,,1998,4.612359550561798
