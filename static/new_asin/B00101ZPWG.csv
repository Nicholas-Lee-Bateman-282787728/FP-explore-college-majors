8236512,4,B00101ZPWG,"I originally saw this show on PBS back in the early 90's and taped it on VHS, but over the years the tape wore out.  It shows the King's Singers performing with the Kansas City Symphony a number of Christmas classics which later turned up on their Christmas album.  The singing and choral work is first class, as one would expect with performers of this lineage.  I was less impressed with the symphony numbers, and frankly the song selection leaves a little to be desired, but it is and was an excellent program.  The only reason it gets four stars instead of five is that the tape is not in the best of condition, and I had to coax my VCR to play it.  It is certainly a better show than the recent one on PBS with the Mormon choir, which evidently prefers to simulate a variety show than a Christmas concert. I do recommend this show, but not the most recent one.",1231804800,,865,4.282208588957055
