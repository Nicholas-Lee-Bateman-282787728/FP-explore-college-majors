8717891,4,B00YAZNC10,"Chris Cole has a superb story to tell. Like many legendary skaters, he grew up an average kid and soon fell in love with the sport. This documentary introduces you to his early life, the hard work he put in to get where he's at, and how he's influenced a generation.

Several of the chapters of the documentary are especially well-done, particularly the early parts when they go over his early life. Though, I found that the documentary lost its trajectory when it went over Love Park and Philadelphia, before moving toward the ""feel good"" ending at Camp Woodward. I would have liked to heard and seen more from Chris Cole's pre 20's life.",1448928000,2,639,4.605263157894737

8717897,4,B00YAZNC10,"This movie is really good very straight forward. Inspiring, but not smacking you over the head with cliche messages. Chris cole was very down to eart and I think everyone can relate to thinking they invented every trick at one point in time.",1435968000,,241,4.627906976744186
