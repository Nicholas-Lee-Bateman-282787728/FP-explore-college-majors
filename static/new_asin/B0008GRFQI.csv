8056564,5,B0008GRFQI,"When they say ""comprehensive"" they mean it. In this pack I got so many travel films it took me abotu two weeks to get through it all.

The footage itself is all ""vintage"" meaning that it was shot in the 1930s and 1940s so the film stock is often gritty, which is not a bad thing given the subject matter.

My favorite films were the ones about how trains and planes were invented and sold to people.

I was also a fan of the south american footage, because its so weirdly alien.

All in all, top rate, but make sure you have enough time to watch it.",1146873600,,549,4.102803738317757
