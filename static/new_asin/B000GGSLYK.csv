8132071,4,B000GGSLYK,"ordered on a whim because it was at a price where i wasn't spending much more for the whole series than just the first volume elsewhere. i had certain expectations of it, having read the source material prior to viewership, but i was pleased overall with it.",1367020800,,258,4.51063829787234
8132072,2,B000GGSLYK,After watching the first episode I noticed that the subtitles were horrible and the start up menu looks put together by someone's home computer. Not happy with this product. I thought I was purchasing a legal copy.,1361404800,,214,4.8108108108108105
8132073,5,B000GGSLYK,"Ultra maniac is fun and satisfying. I am a big fan of Special A, The Familiar of Zero and Lovely Complex to name a few. This reminds me of all of them, but it has its own unique personality. Nina is a witch in training that can't seem to get any spells to go right. Ayu is a friend whom Nina 'tries to help', but all her attempts go hilariously awry. The first couple of discs are just fun and fluffy and the rest are a little darker; Nina battles her rival and tries to win hidden crystals to increase her magic. I recommend this to anyone who likes fun characters, good plots and lots of cute outfits.",1316736000,2,603,4.11864406779661
8132074,5,B000GGSLYK,My daughter is eleven and very much into Menga.  I let her buy the ones that are rated for thirteen (PG13) and let her watch anime that isn't vulgar.  This show was completely for her age.  And I liked it too.,1207785600,7,209,4.048780487804878
8132075,5,B000GGSLYK,"This is one of the cutest animes ever.  If you liked the manga, you'll probably like this, although the storyline is different.  I actually like the storyline here better.  The characters all come across well (poor Ayu, and her cool image!) and the antics are just as crazy as anyone could wish.  I highly recommend this set!",1192579200,4,325,4.649122807017544
