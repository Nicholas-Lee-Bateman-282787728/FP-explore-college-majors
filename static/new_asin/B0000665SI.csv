7961618,3,B0000665SI,"A governess comes to a country estate owned by Lord Gregory (Derek Jacobi) a strutting fool who spends his days idly as he feels is proper for a man of his station.  He leaves the raising of his children to the nanny and the running of his house to his butler Tom (Oliver Reed), a man who makes almost no attempt to hide his contempt for his master but Lord Gregory is completely oblivious because he's confident in his superiority based on birthright.

Blueblood was marketed as a horror movie based on some very minimal supernatural elements--it could more accurately be described as a withering satire of the uselessness of the upper class--Lord Gregory's estate is a tourist attraction with an  admissions booth on the road, a zoo in the garden and affordably priced meals served in rooms that once catered only to the gentry.  Lord Gregory is little more than another trapped animal strutting around the estate like one of his peacocks, selling the fantasy of being wealthy and titled to anyone with the money for a ticket.

But if Lord Gregory is the titled owner of the estate it is Oliver Reed's butler Tom who actually runs and controls everything employing a combination of superior wits, strong will and a little black magic.  Early in the film Lord Gregory positively beams, proud of the fact that Tom runs the house as if it was his own--words that take on a different meaning by the end of the film.

Derek Jacobi's Lord Gregory is a fool so ridiculous he truly doesn't understand why the nanny shouldn't take the blame after he accidentally injured his own son--there are benefits to high birth after all.  He also doesn't see why he should have anything to do with the raising of his children even though he lives under the same roof with them.  Derek Jacobi plays Lord Gregory as almost tragic in his stupidity--in a battle of wits with his butler Lord Gregory isn't even a mouse--he's the cheese that gets eaten by the mouse.  Oliver Reed gives one of his stronger performances, polite and endlessly efficient on the surface but seething with contempt towards those who have what they don't deserve simply by an accident of birth.  Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed play well off each other--the scenes where they share the screen are by far the best in the movie.

Blueblood might make a good double bill with The Ruling Class, a much more famous feature that also mercilessly skewered the British upper classes.  But where The Ruling Class is clearly a comedy it's much harder to tell exactly what Blueblood is supposed to be--there is a supernatural element but not enough for the movie to be a horror film; the class criticism is vicious but never played for laughs; the movie might be a satirical allegory but to what end exactly is hard to say.  Ultimately Blueblood is an interesting curiosity but not an especially good film--although those who hate the rich as a matter of principle should find much to enjoy.",1419292800,,2931,4.688109161793372
7961619,3,B0000665SI,"This movie is so bad it's good. It has a cast to die for (Oliver Reed, Fiona Lewis, Derek Jacobi, ...) but the script...well, the script is the epitome of terrible, bad, horrid. The actors each does what he or she can with this behemoth, but it really is beyond saving.

Until you look at it as a comedic parody on Britain's Upper Crust. Gregory (Derek Jacobi) is the Earl of Something who lives a life of utter depravity, leaving the way open to his butler (Oliver Reed), a mildly satanic character, to take over the running and eventually the ownership of the Steetly Heum. Fiona Lewis plays the meek, mild nanny for Gregory's two bratty kids who is trapped between the butler's plot to take over and Gregory's licentiousness.

I'd love to be able to give a Derek Jacobi movie a good review, but it's impossible with this one; this movie is so bad it's good. Watching the actors struggle to make any sense at all of this godawful script is a lesson in really good acting, and for that reason I grace it with three stars. But don't let the three stars fool you; this movie is not good.",1189814400,2,1086,4.398009950248756
