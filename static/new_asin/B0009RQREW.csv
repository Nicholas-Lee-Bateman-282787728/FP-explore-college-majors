8065620,5,B0009RQREW,My family loves to rent movies on family night. One family night my 4 year old daughter picked out the Trollz movie and loved it so much she cried when we had to return it. So i decided to find the movie and buy it for her as a gift. What a gift it turned out to be! It came with another DVD. She watches them both still!,1226707200,2,321,3.735294117647059

I think that the young and the young at heart could both enjoy these movies. They give a good message of the importance of friendship, as well. I can't wait for more.",1126656000,7,271,4.666666666666667
