6897996,5,B00R244DUA,"It isn't unusual for people to shed a tear or two during or after a particular movie.  Hell, I was brushing them away during ""Toy Story 3.""  Perhaps the best recent example is ""Still Alice"" which garnered an Oscar for Julianne Moore.  A glutton for punishment, I decided to watch this film from Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.  To be honest, I didn't know much about the movie.  It had been sitting on my shelf for a few months and it was time.

The film is set in the very early 1900's in rural Sweden.  In the opening scene we see an extreme close up of a woman asleep.  As she slowly awakens, we see agony in her eyes and face.  She begins to gasp for air.  At first, I thought she was the victim of carbon monoxide poisoning.  But this was 115 years ago and the dark, wrinkled skin under her eyes suggest something else.  Indeed, Agnes appears to be in the last throws of cancer.  Harriet Andersson, as Agnes is remarkable.  Her performance is unsettling as the dying woman suffers.  I was choking back tears after 5 minutes.

The movie takes place in Agnes's home.  Her two sisters, Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullmann, who also plays the sisters' mother in flashback scenes) and Agnes's long time housekeeper, Anna (Kari Sylwan) alternate taking care of the dying woman.  We learn that the sisters don't get along and haven't been close since childhood.  Maria, the youngest was always perceived to be her parent's favorite.  So the other sisters resented her and her strawberry blond hair.  While Karin shuns Maria, who wants to reconcile, they appear rightfully concerned about their sister's fate.

The relationship between Anna and Agnes appears to be the closest however.  When Agnes is in her worst pain, we look away along with Karin and Maria.  Only Anna snuggles in bed with the poor woman, offering the bare skin of her chest as comfort.  Bergman, interestingly segues each scene change with a bright red color.  He uses extreme close ups of the actors faces often and with great effect.  Cinematographer Sven Nykvist won an Oscar for his work.

This is a difficult film to watch, but is one of the best at projecting the darkness of the human condition.  I promise you will remember it.  As a side note, for those interested, I recommend reading a brilliant review of this film by the late Roger Ebert (rogerebert.com).  His words provide a better description than I can deliver.",1426032000,23,2406,4.6571428571428575

8693796,5,B00R244DUA,"Of all the Bergman Ive seen to date, this is the first that  - for me  fully married mind heart and soul.  Intensely beautiful to look at, with red  the color of blood, of death, of passion everywhere, and with performances that are generally astounding.  Up to this point, there is often a theatricality even to the great Bergman performances, but here everything feels devistatingly real.

I find that Bergman is a director experienced as much in the aftershocks and absorption of seeing his films as in the moment of watching them.  Tears came to me an hour after watching the film, not while I was seeing it.  Its not the way Im used to film (or art) working, but Ive found that too many times with Bergman for it to be mere coincidence.  The exploration of the slow painful death of a 19th century woman on her two sisters and long time maid (and lover?) is the subject, but it is experienced more like a poem than like a story.  And the moments of horrific reality (Ive never seen on screen sickness and death so real) and poetic grace and surreal dream images dance together with nary a hitch.

The film looks amazing on the Criterion blu-ray.  This is a case where an upgrade really makes sense.",1454025600,3,1203,4.467889908256881
8693797,4,B00R244DUA,"Ingmar Bergman's 1972 film VISKNINGAR OCH ROP (Cries and Whispers) was one of the auteur's major achievements of that decade. In a Swedish country house, the dying Agnes (Harriet Andersson) is visited by her two sisters, the sensual and impulsive Karin (Liv Ullmann), and the stern and frigid Maria (Ingrid Thulin). Though ostensibly there to comfort Agnes in her last days, they are essentially just waiting for her to die, as they are too more preoccupied with their unhappy marriages, their mysterious personal feud, and the specifics of dividing up the estate. It falls to Agnes' devoted maid Anna (Kari Sylwan) to provide any human warmth. One of the most emotionally touching aspects of the film is this contrast between the selfless love of a member of a despised underclass and the indifference (or outright disgust) expressed by Agnes' own family.

Bergman had made the transition to colour film with EN PASION of three years earlier, but VISKNINGAR OCH ROP finally exploits its possibilities. Red is ever present on screen, whether in the red wing of the house in which Agnes lies dying, the red transitions between scenes, or the vivid blood that flows in each of the sisters' flashbacks to the decay of their marriages. Sven Nykvist's cinematography is, as always, brilliant. And though one doesn't often think of the makeup artist in a Bergman film, whoever worked on this one deserves praise for making such a glamorous actress as Harriet Andersson (still in her late 30s then and quite glamorous) look convincingly decrepit.

Bergman considered VISKNINGAR OCH ROP one of his two greatest films, along with 1966's PERSONA. I must confess, however, that I have never ranked it so highly. While PERSONA continues to amaze me on every viewing, VISKNINGAR OCH ROP does tend to exhaust its overt symbolism and interpersonal dynamics right away, and I rarely come back to it. Furthermore, I feel Bergman wove too much of this film out of what had become stock gestures for him, such as incestuous siblings, and a man speaking about the need to trust God when he himself has lost faith.

Criterion released this film on DVD years ago, but the upgrade to Blu-Ray is very welcome, presenting the lush interiors in a higher-definition light. And while some Criterion Blu-Rays just inherit the same extras as on the earlier DVD release, this CRIES AND WHISPERS has both the old extras and new stuff, namely a new interview with Harriet Anderson and the hour-long documentary featurette ""Ingmar Bergman: Reflections on Life, Death, and Love with Erland Josephson"".",1440633600,3,2566,5.004683840749414
8693798,5,B00R244DUA,"This movie, at least to me, is raw. It's hard to watch as this woman gives an outstanding performance of a woman in her final stages of cancer. I literally had to stop the movie and take a minute-as the scene is where she is gasping for air.  This movie is one of the first that really portrays the ugliness and hardships of cancer.  Not only with the victim who is dying, but the family and the terror it causes.",1434844800,,413,4.15
8693799,5,B00R244DUA,"Perhaps the greatest of director Ingmar Bergman's later works, this piece from the early 1970s expresses the contrasts between life and death, pain and joy, innocence and too much experience . . . it is one of his most stunning-looking films; his use of the color red in the film is haunting and structurally imaginative. Every sound, every piece of life is magnified, as if under a microscope -- especially suffering. It is a difficult film to watch, but it is a magnificent triumph with the most extraordinary performances. The last moments of the film are so simple and lovely that they are like a benediction. It's a film you'll never forget.",1433548800,2,646,4.776785714285714

8693801,5,B00R244DUA,"I discovered Bergman late in life. Ever since I have tried to see all his films. As a fan of black and white films I have only seen his films from the 50's and 60's so far...and I'm not even through all of those yet. Bergman has a reputation for depressing or Bleak. Personally I've always thought it was a bit harsh. But then again...I like Bleak films. I have put off his color films so far. No real reason. At the behest of a fellow Bergman lover,this film was suggested to me. All I can say is I ordered it the second the film ended. The great thing about Bergman is everyone seems to have a film that they say is his best film. I hear The Seventh Seal,The Virgin Spring,Through a Glass Darkly,The Silence,Fanny and Alexander(I still have not seen that one),Persona,Hour of the Wolf....etc. I guess it just matters on your taste in Bergman.
It is my opinion so far at least that this is his best film. Until now I've always claimed the Virgin Spring as my favorite. This film is truly one of the most shocking and mesmerizing films I've seen in a long time. It is Bleak. It is depressing. It is Mesmerizing. I simply was not expecting it..even from Bergman. A metaphor of red bleeding art,death,pain,masochism,manipulation,mental illness and unjust treatment. A masterpiece. But I warn anyone who watches it..if you think your not going to be surprised because you think you know Bergman. You just might be. I was both stunned and blown away. Stunning performances. Stunning cinematography. Really,really red, contrasted by a white and black color scheme throughout the film. Surreal on a whole different level for Bergman. I'm not going to go into the plot to much. But I feel I must explain my own reaction to this film and why I consider it his best work. I'll just say that in the beginning of the film I thought I might take it out. The emphasis on the slow agonizing death of what you think is the central character was hard to watch. I thought if Bergman is just going to torture the audience for 2 hrs with this I can't watch it. But then the film changes and switches the emphasis on the other characters. My opinion is that the film is about the reactions of 3 women (2 sisters and a maid) have not only of the death of their sister but the truths about their own personalities as they emerge after the death. It's a film about the tragedies and reactions of a family caught in the aftermath of a long horrible ,painful illness and death of a loved one. Bergman made this film in the aftermath of a dissolved relationship in his own life. I'd also like to add that all the actors gave up they're own salaries to help him financially complete the film. So the belief in the importance of the work was shared by all.
It is a film that is a must for Bergman Fans. This new criterion double edition is cleaned up,and has a great interview with one of the actresses,and a small interview with Bergman himself, where he explains the original image of red that came to him.
A hidden gem from 1972 that lasts through time. Bergman saw blood apparently. He just saw red and put it in a film.",1428969600,14,3096,4.433333333333334
8693802,5,B00R244DUA,"CRIES AND WHISPERS is one of Ingmar Bergmans most somber films, thematically, but one of the best from an artistic point of view. The story focuses on a dying woman, her two sisters, and a dedicated servant. The movie takes a look at how imminent death affects not only the one who will die, but those close to her as well. The actors  Liv Ullman, Harriet Andersson, Ingrid Thulin and Erland Josephson  are all excellent and bring their characters to vivid, if troubled, life.

Ms. Andersson plays Agnes, in the final stages of cancer and in great pain. Ms. Ullman plays two roles: Maria, who once cheated on her husband and drove him to attempt suicide, as well as the womans mother (shown in flashbacks). Ms. Thulin is gripping as Karin, suicidal, unhappily married, who once resorted to self-mutilation to avoid contact with her husband.

Bergmans films, and this one in particular, are rich in atmosphere and don't gloss over the tough realities of life. In that sense, the film is a truer reflection of people in emotional turmoil than Hollywood generally manages. Of course, that makes for a bleak movie, and it surely is not every viewers cup of tea.

Sven Nykvists photography is dramatic and contributes significantly to the poetic nature of the film. He uses saturated color, especially crimson, as he visually reflects on the psychological turmoil of the women.

Bonus features on the Criterion Collection Blu-ray restoration include a 2001 introduction by Ingmar Bergman, new interview with Harriet Andersson, new video essay on the films visuals, behind-the-scenes footage with commentary, a 52-minute interview with Bergman and his longtime collaborator Erland Josephson, and a critical essay. The film is in Swedish, with English subtitles.",1428537600,4,1755,5.097560975609756
