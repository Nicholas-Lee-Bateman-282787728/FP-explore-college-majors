They are some good fight moments, nothing to write home to mama. The movie starts by a son who looks like a girl witnessing his father being murdered by a rival then follows the guy throughout the movie, as his flunky!! All I know is you kill my dad I not going to follow u... The story is all over the place... Forget about it....",1362441600,,502,4.351063829787234
8035299,4,B0002ZDWVW,"I bought this movie mainly because of its stars Lo Leih and Hwang Jang-Lee who are in my opinion the greatest villians in classic kungfu cinema. The story is ok as Tu Ta-Shin(Chen Sing) plays the lead role and Hwang Jang-Lee(Nan Pa-Ting) plays the main villian. Tu Ta-Shin is actually a anti-hero as he ""kills"" the young boy's father in the beginning and takes the boy with him, only to train him allowing him to challenge him at any time. He does however grant the fathers last wish to kill the traitor Nan Pa-Ting. It has nice choreographed action scenes and the story is fairly easy to follow. I gave this movie 4 out of 5 stars because though its is good, the lead villians have had better roles,(see Born Invincible for Lo Leih and Hells Windstaff for Hwang Jang-Lee) and I also thought the little kids role was almost not even necessary for the story. If you like old school kungfu it is a must see.",1125100800,,905,4.425149700598802
8035300,3,B0002ZDWVW,"This is a pretty good movie featuring the powerful Chen Sing and the great kicker Hwang Jang Lee.  It also features the lovely Doris Lung, and the main kid is pretty acrobatic (he's also in DEATH DUEL OF MANTIS and CRANE FIGHTER).  With a cameo appearance and action choreography by Yuen Biao it's hard to go wrong, but this dvd version cuts out a key sequence.  The missing footage has the kid playing with a puppy in a cave while Chen Sing is sitting by the fire.  Chen Sing all of a sudden takes the puppy from the kid and smashes it to the ground killing it and saying ""In revenge, there's no room for kindness.""  This infuriates the kid who then lunges at Chen Sing and they start fighting.  This dvd version simply shows the boy petting the dog, then putting it down (cutting out the fact that the dog's now dead) and then cuts to the boy lunging at Chen without the puppy's death as his main motivation.  It's a minor cut in amount of time, but it was one of the most memorable moments in the film when I first saw it back in the 1980s and one that I clearly remember to this day.  One other aspect I didn't remember, or at least didn't notice at the time, was how much undercranking (speeding up of the film, like when Benny Hill runs) there is in this film which is unfortunate.  Still, the story is solid and most of the martial artistry survives intact.  I recommend this movie, I only wish it hadn't been censored.",1118534400,3,1426,4.287313432835821

There are some graininess, some white crap you usually see in any low budget kung fu flick but it isn'y really that bad! The movie itself is pretty good! It's got really well choregraphed kung fu in which Yuen Biao and Cory Yuen are responsible for! And some weird characters! The story is the typical revenge, I must challenge you to become popular type! So product is a 7/10

the movie is 3 stars or if you perfer 6/10!",1110758400,,536,4.414141414141414
