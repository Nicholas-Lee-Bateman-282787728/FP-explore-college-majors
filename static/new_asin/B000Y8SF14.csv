8540650,5,B000Y8SF14,"This is an educational video made for children that is not too simplified for adults. I enjoyed that they didn't sugar coat Adams's famously known abrasive personality. It lets kids know that all these almost mythical Founding Fathers were real people and that we should listen to what people have to say instead of being fooled by his or her superficial outside packaging.

John Adams was obviously a very smart and educated man who also made mistakes. Again, the video doesn't try to hide this. It talks about him skipping school and enforcing the Sedition Act. All of this is balanced well in the video.",1232928000,2,606,4.771428571428571
