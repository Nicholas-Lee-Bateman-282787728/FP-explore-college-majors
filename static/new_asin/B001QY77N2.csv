8336841,1,B001QY77N2,"As with all attempts to reenact the single bullet theory, certain little ""details"" have to be fudged to make it appear convincing for the uninformed TV viewer. Entrance wounds need to be moved (many people are unaware that the medical panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the 1970s moved the wound in JFK's ""neck"" down to its proper place in his upper back); angles need to be changed; the bodies of JFK and Connally have to be arranged in ways that do not fit the photographs from Dealey Plaza (depicting JFK leaning forward, when he was actually sitting up straight), or showing the bullet entering the wrong side of Connally's wrist, as NOVA did.

One of the most prominent errors in this program's reenactment (using two headless torsos) is that the profile shot of the bullet's path made it clear the bullet exited from the Kennedy torso's chest, and not its throat. They do correctly show the bullet entering JFK's back, not the neck, but the result is exactly what critics have always noted: the bullet would exit from JFK's chest.",1430438400,,1058,4.75
8336842,5,B001QY77N2,"This is an indepth look at the assination of JFK. This focuses on the ""magic"" bullet, placement of people, the video and audio evidence. It is well worth the money. I use this video in my Forensic Science class to present the JFK assination. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn more and get a scientific point of view to the assination. This is well done and presented in a clear and well thoughtout method.",1383609600,2,422,4.4935064935064934
