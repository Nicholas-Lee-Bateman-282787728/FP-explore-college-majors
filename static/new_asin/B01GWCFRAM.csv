Movie script writer Joe Gillis found him self in the sunset of his career. While escaping auto preprocessors, by accident or fait he turns into a driveway on Sunset Boulevard and begins a new chapter with a mysterious actress who is in the sunset of her career.

This play in three acts is packed with stars of the time. Many of the Stars and the writer reflect their real lives in the story. I am not going to bring up a list because they are fun to discover as they show up on the screen.

Even though the movie can hold its own and is worth re-watching, be sure to get a DVD with the audio commentary. The commentary helps you see what you are watching; it also covers the original beginning of the movie.

I have been tainted before viewing this movie by watching then Carol Burnet version.

8764078,5,B01GWCFRAM,"In Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) a superb cast, story and cinematography combine to make a film noir classic. This was one of the first selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, and is #16 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 best American movies.

It's the story of a young man who falls under the control of an aging former silent-era starlet. When she realizes that Joe Gillis (Holden) is a screenwriter, Norma Desmond (Swanson) asks him to polish the script for her imagined ""comeback"" movie. Along the way, he becomes financially dependent on the older lady, who quickly falls in love with him. On New Year's Eve Gillis rejects Desmond's advances, eventually gets involved with another woman and tragedy ensues.

Erich von Stroheim is excellent as Miss Desmond's butler. The supporting cast also includes Cecil B. DeMille (as himself); he directed Miss Swanson in several silent features, starting with 1919's ""Don't Change Your Husband."" Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper portrays herself, as well. Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have bridge-playing cameos.

Also directed by Billy Wilder, DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944) starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edw. G. Robinson, is another superlative example of the film noir genre. (VHS edition)
