8127362,5,B000FVREC6,"THis is the final of all my AJ Boner DVDs  I started as dead last in score every round the first 2 rounds of 9 holes each with my new and experienced golf foursome. only one of the 4  continues to beat me after only 6 weeks of playing 9 holes and hitting a bucket of balls practice each week.  I've watched all the other videos 2 times.

I think the most important process is to only learn from AJ and none of your friends failed ideas of what's the right way.

I wager I will be ahead of them all within the next 3 to 6 months? any takers? I'm in Winter Haven Florida.
