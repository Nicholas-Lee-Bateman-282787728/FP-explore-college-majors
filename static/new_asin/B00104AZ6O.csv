8236839,4,B00104AZ6O,"This story seems to be an attempt by the writer to place things as close to real life as possible. Putting the characters in challenging situations, like we all find ourselves in from time to time. As a pastor, who seems to represent ""the church"" or the body of Christ, the lead truly struggles with who he is in Christ. For he is a sinner just like the rest of us - flawed.
The acting is extremely strong and well done by the leads. The story lines are hard, but real. Some of the production has some growing pains, but what new company doesn't.
The cast & crew should be proud of what they've accomplished. Any Christian can see themselves in the main character's shoes and have to struggle with how they would deal with that situation.
Well done.",1205971200,3,749,4.39568345323741
8236840,5,B00104AZ6O,"Good writing and good story line.  This would be a great buy for churches
to use for their discussions.  I did not think about how difficult it is
being a minister and the daily difficulties they must have.  Well performed and well directed.  Sometimes bad reviews make people want to see a movie more.  I cannot wonder how this Mr. Owen would have a copy
of a movie before it is put up for sale if he were not involved in the
making of the movie.",1205884800,2,447,4.151162790697675
8236841,5,B00104AZ6O,"Hi. I'm the creator/writer/producer of ""The Church,"" and wanted to give you a synopsis and overview of what it's about.

Pastor Ian Gallagher appears to have it all: A loving wife and family, a church that adores him. But all is not as it seems. Pastor Ian's world is about to change, and he'll face challenges that threaten his family, his church, even his fitness to lead his congregation.

The first crisis begins when a member of Pastor Ian's church leaves his wife to move in with his girlfriend. But when the member decides to bring his girlfriend with him to church, a series of events is set in motion that threatens to split the congregation, and expose a dark chapter of Pastor Ian's past.

Pastor Ian also faces numerous personal conflicts: his stubborn, rebellious daughter starts dating a boy with a secret; his brother is stricken with leukemia, and the preacher tries to witness to him about Christ before it's too late; his church struggles with financial troubles, and Ian wonders if they'll have to part with his youth pastor and wife.

""The Church"" is about real Christians fighting the battles, small and large, that they fight every day. It's not about hypocritical or phony ""Hollywood"" Christians, or the simple-minded lemmings they are portrayed as by the majority of the media.

It's not easy material, the kind of often-sappy fare associated with typical ""Christian"" movies. In real life, there are sad endings along with happy ones. ""The Church"" portrays that reality; it goes deeper, into the mysteries of living life while serving God. Christians will appreciate seeing their values and morals reflected in a way that Hollywood just doesn't understand. Non-Christians will get a picture of the Christian life that they haven't seen before.

It's a movie for everyone, because it's about people. It's real.

It's life.
