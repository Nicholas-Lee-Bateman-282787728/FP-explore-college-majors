8361107,4,B002BEXFGO,"Not a bad DVD of old TV shows. Boston Blackie is always good, though a bit fuzzy in quality. Alarm was a pilot for an Emergency-like show, and the pilot for Mandrake the Magician was okay, if only for the appearance of Woody Strode as Lother; the pacing of the show was a bit stilted and the ending was VERY rushed. Front Page Detective is like Boston Blackie - good but often lower in video quality. The Witness was the gem of the disc; this had a very film noir feel to it and I'd love to find more episodes of Counterpoint/Rebound to see if they're all like this one.",1432512000,2,570,4.1909090909090905

8361109,4,B002BEXFGO,"There were some shows on this that I really didn't care for. But, they are still okay to have. Boston Blackie is the best show on this DVD; Kent Taylor playing him.",1376784000,,164,4.15625
8361110,3,B002BEXFGO,"Lost Crime Shows, Volume 2 is a mixed bag of failed television series pilots and early 1950s detective series episodes.

`The Motorcycle Kid' was a Boston Blackie episode from 1953.  Blackie tries to help an out-of-work teenager who has embarked on a life of crime.  The series regulars were Kent Taylor as Blackie, Frank Orth as Inspector Farraday, Lois Collier as Blackie's girlfriend Mary Wesley with Sandy Sanders and Gloria Saunders as the mixed-up kids.

""Alarm"" (1956) was an unsold pilot concerning the adventures of fire departments throughout the country.  The pilot episode fictionalized the events leading to the deadly Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire in Boston, Massachusetts where nearly 500 patrons died.  The episode stars were John Hoyt, Dorothy Green and John Hubbard.

""Mandrake the Magician"" (1954) was an unsold pilot about a crime-fighting conjurer who is assisted by the mighty Lothar and the beautiful Princess Narda.  In this program, enemy agents kidnap Narda to force Mandrake to help them locate a spy who possesses vital information.  Mandrake was played by real-life magician Coe Norton, with Woody Strode as Lothar and Lisa Howard as Narda.  The pilot, based on the long-running comic strip, had interesting possibilities, but was hamstrung by the fact that, as an actor, Norton made a great magician and even Strode's thespian skills had not evolved very far at this point in his career.

""Counterpoint"" (1952) aka ""Rebound"" was a dramatic anthology series.  Lee Marvin made his television debut in the episode presented on this DVD titled ""The Witness"". He play a hard-nosed police detective investigating a murder and jewel heist committed by a small-time crook.  The episode features the ubiquitous William Schallert as well as Vera Marshe and Robert Karnes.

""Front Page Detective"" (1951) concerned the adventures of a reporter who covered crime stories for a major metropolitan newspaper.  In this episode, he gets mixed up with waterfront smugglers and gets shot for his troubles.  The series starred Edmund Lowe as reporter David Chase and Paula Lowe as his lovely girlfriend, Sharon Richards, with Kathryn Card, Otto Reichow, Dennis Moore and George Pembroke featured in the cast.",1285977600,22,2218,5.2763532763532766
