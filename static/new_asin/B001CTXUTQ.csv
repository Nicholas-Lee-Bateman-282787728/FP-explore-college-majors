3519993,3,B001CTXUTQ,"Obviously B:TAS is a classic, I don't need to go on about that.

But this double-dip is almost unforgivable. Fans waited YEARS for box sets of B:TAS to finally arrive and this has to be one of the biggest ""screw you""s I can think of in the history of home video.

Of course, if, unbelievably, you're a big Batman fan and somehow you haven't bought the series, this is worth getting. It's a better deal than buying the sets separately.

But we all know that this is not the audience WB was really going for with the release. They were hoping that the die-hard fans would shell out another $100 for something they already own just to get some spiffy packaging and some new special features.

3519994,5,B001CTXUTQ,"In 1992, Bruce Timm and Paul Dini revolutionized animation and redefined what a ""kids cartoon"" could be by bringing their vision of Batman alive on the small screen.  Though based on the foundation of the 1989 ""Batman"" film and it's sequel ""Batman Returns"" which came out the same year, the series was not an adaptation of that concept, characters, or world.  It stood independent of everything that had come before or would come later.  It combined only the best elements of the other incarnations, and become something else: a legend in it's own right.

It did not pander down to it's target audiences youth, but instead walked a very fine line between remaining acceptable for all ages and embracing the true mythos of the dark knight.  It featured forensic science at a time before such was common place, it showcased the often overlooked detective skills and intelligence of Bruce Wayne/Batman, and did something that no other incarnation of the Batman universe has ever been able to do - before or in it's wake - it pleased everyone without compromise.

If you ask 1,000 Batman fans what the greatest incarnation of ""Batman"" is to them, including the comics, about 980 of them will tell you ""Batman: The Animated Series"" as their answer.  It offered everything everyone loved about each version that had come before or has come since in perfect balance.  It did things no one thought possible, either for Batman or for a ""kids show"".  It truly changed things, and no other animated series has ever lived up to the bar it set.

Nothing before it had been ever so mature without getting into 'adult' themes.  By comparison, today's ""kids cartoons"" are true to the definition; cartoons and caricatures of their sources and of reality.  ""Batman: the Animated Series"" was a truly realistic show that anyone from any age from 2 to 82 could sit down and enjoy.  If you are a Batman fan and you have not seen this series, or if you had but do not yet own it... this is worth every penny.",1217980800,83,1985,4.702312138728324

Helmed by visionaries Bruce W.

3519996,5,B001CTXUTQ,"""Batman: The Animated Series"" came in the prime of my childhood. I was glued to the TV every time it came on. From the amazing intro sequence down to the end credits, this show is an amazing combination of storytelling, animation, and music (which held closely to Danny Elfman's style). Part of the appeal of this show is that it holds one of the widest audiences in television history, capturing the full attention of both kids and adults. The packaging, along with everything that is included for the money Amazon is charging for this set is amazing! They do not make TV shows like this anymore!",1217376000,8,597,4.6415094339622645

3520003,4,B001CTXUTQ,"It arrived right away, several days before the first estimated arrival date in fact. There are some scratches which make the DVDs skip when played in a PS3. They seem to work fine in a standard DVD player though.
The box and cases are very nice, but some of the plastic bits which hold the discs in place are broken, so they slide if the case is open.

The series itself is pretty good. A bit more Adam West than Christian Bale in the story style, so you'll be caught by surprise if you're used to the Batman Beyond darker, cyberpunk overtones.",1409961600,2,544,4.333333333333333

Both those series are also linked to the ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and all culminate in ''Justice League'', which are all very satisfying DVD releases.

I was quite dissapointed, however, that it did not include the animated movies! They're a MUST! They are:

- Batman: Mask of the Phantasm
- Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero
- Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman",1409961600,3,485,5.1265822784810124

3520015,5,B001CTXUTQ,"This is the Batman that every other one in any other media should look up to!  My review might or might not be very long because, rather than list everything I like about a product, I normally just list its negative attributes and how they impact my opinion.  Occasionally, I do list positive attributes either because I really, really like them or they may not be mainstream.
  Anyway, I love everything about this series, hence the 10 stars I'm awarding it no matter what Amazon's limits are.  So that kills any negative attributes.  As for what I really, really like, that goes to the voice acting.  I was lucky enough to actually see almost every episode of this series before losing my sight, so I was able to recall a lot when I got my hands on the DVDs more recently.  But the voices make up for anything visual I might have forgotten over the years.
  Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are my favorites as Batman and The Joker.  Though ironically, Hamill is not in my favorite episode of the series, that being ""I Am the Knight"".  Granted, all episodes are great in one way or another, but I am the Knight is my absolute favorite by just a little bitI just like how it uses its plot to define Batman's relationship with James Gordon.
  If I had to choose, ""Heart of Ice"" would come in second, again by just a little bit.  ""Shadow of the Bat"" takes third, ""It's Never Too Late"" is right behind it in fourth, and ""The Terrible Trio"" takes fifthI'm not going on as it only gets tougher from here on outit's all very close.  And besideseveryone surely has their own favorites.
  The shows fourth season, also known as ""The New Batman Adventures"" or ""Batman:  Gotham Knights"", is also included and I'm not disappointed by that.  While the first three seasons are better, the fourth is still very good and does not lower my opinion of the series as a whole.  Episodes like ""Double Talk"", Growing Pains"", ""Over the Edge"", and ""Mad Love"" can proudly stand up next to the episodes I mentioned earlier and more.  The episode ""Old Wounds"" nicely ties these two different animated versions of the series together as we learn more about the transition from Dick Grayson as Robin to Tim Drake as Robin.  Plus, there's a pretty cool Supergirl crossover in this season.
  So, ultimately, this is a series that I've wanted to get my hands on for a long time and you should definitely get it as well.  I do advise that you be patient and wait for the right price to come alongtrust me, the wait will be worth it.  EnjoyI know you will.",1404345600,,2520,4.469298245614035
3520016,5,B001CTXUTQ,"I loved this show when I was little and the DVD set is as brilliant as I remember. I could use more of the commentary episodes, they're all great, but this is totally worth it if you enjoyed the show like I did.",1403481600,,211,3.9302325581395348

3520018,4,B001CTXUTQ,"This is truly a great package for a great tv show. I won't talk about the show as that has been done already by various other reviewers. So onto the packaging for this set it includes the following extras:
Volume one : Disc 1 Commentary for Pilot and featurette : Dark Knight First pilot promo.
Disc 2: Ep 14 Heart of Ice Commentary and Featurette Batman: The Legacy Continues
Disc 3: Tour of the Batcave. Volume Two: Disc 1: Ep 4 Robin's Reckoning Part 1 commentary Featurette: Robin's Rising
Disc 2: Ep 11 Heart of Steel Part 2 commentary Featurette Gotham's Gurdians. Disc 3: Ep 18 Almost Got 'Im commentary Featurette Voices of the Knight and Disc 4 Ep 28 Harley & Ivy Commentary. Volume Three Disc 1 Featurette Gotham's New Knight. Disc 2 Ep 8 Read my lips (N.B in booklet it says this is a video commentary but on checking the disc it's a normal regular commentary). EP 14 House & Garden (a very interesting and only video commentary on set shame there weren't more). Disc 3 Ep 16 Harlequinade commentary. Volume 4 Disc 1 Interactive Arkham Asylum. Disc 2: Ep 12 Over The Edge Commentary. Disc 3 Ep 14: Critters Commentary. Disc 4 Ep 19 Legends of the Dark Knight commentary. The Real treat however is the bonus 17th Disc with New Documentary Shades of the Bat: Batman's Animated evolution, also on the disc but not advertised on packaging or Booklet is the Short doc on Batman Anime: A look at Gotham Knight (that was the bridge between Batman Begins and Dark Knight) aswell as Featurettes on Justice League: New Frontier and Wonder Woman Sneak Peak (of the animated release) and some trailers. You also get a nice booklet which aswell as episode listings has nice wall to wall artwork including Rogues gallery of Batman Villians. It is really nice to look at and it's mostly pictures rather than any essay or critiques. Now this set totals 35 hours of Dark Knight justice (as stated on packaging) the episodes run in at 2379 mins so that gives just over 11 hours worth of extras. Now being from the UK I would say this is the ultimate package as we don't even have this in the UK (We have same 4 volume set aswell as DVD bumper collection with special intros by Bruce Timm but nothing like this and in Europe they just have 16 disc set but not the bonus disc that is on this US version). So I would say this is the ultimate package for a truly great show, Kudos to seller Northern Outlet, very well packaged, Super fast delivery and bargain price on GBP conversion was just 127. So why rate the set 4 stars and not 5, well the DVD cases themselves are very flimsy, despite seller packaging really well I found that the plastic Digipak casing inside one the 2 volumes almost broke as it makes a cracking sound when you first open it. I say almost as soon as I heard the crack I carefully opened the case fully, you have to be really careful when handling this set. Also it is disappointing that there is only 1 video commentary, because if there were more it would rival the truly fantastic video commentaries on Sony's The Real Ghostbusters Complete Collection - another great show. For all fans of this show this is a must buy especially for the new bonus extras's on the 17th disc. As this title is now deleted, you can only find via 3rd party sellers on Amazon, grab a copy today you won't be disappointed a truly fantastic set despite the fragile Digipak Casing.",1397347200,,3374,4.47001620745543

3520050,3,B001CTXUTQ,"This DVD set of batman the animated series, collecting all three seasons of the original show, plus the one season revamp from the late nineties, is something I have watched again and again, and do not get tired of. Unfortunately the price, especially found here is absolutely ridiculously absurd.
  If you were to buy all of the volumes separately, and you were a savy shopper, it would probably run you about eighty dollars, less if you bought them used. The only additional parts of this set that weren't in the original releases of the show is one bonus features disc which isn't actually much to write home about, and a booklet listing all of the episodes, with some sketches and concept art. If these are important for you, by all means spend the extra on this set.
  The disks are stacked on top of one another, which I personally hate, and the centerpieces don't hold the discs in place so they slip around. Its very inconvenient. Also the disc holders are held together by what appears to be scotch tape, and the cardboard packaging around them is shoddy to say the least. there is an insert that goes on the outside of the package but its not secured in place at all except by the plastic sleeve thing that goes around the whole package, and when you take this sleeve off, which is necessary to watch the show, the insert falls off. also the aforementioned sleeve is brittle and breaks, and no I'm not careless, I bought a second one because i thought it was my fault and they both do the same thing.
  Its not god awful, but its pretty disappointing how much they cheaped out, honestly I'm probably going to sell mine and buy the regular show, and just keep the bonus stuff, or just buy some better packaging. Very good show though.",1373500800,,1743,4.517460317460317
3520051,1,B001CTXUTQ,I finally bought this after years of waiting. Damn was I disappointed. For the price of 200$ Inside the case (which is awesome) the actual holders for the DVD are very fragile and some of the plastic holders were actually broken! For a collection this expensive I was expecting something stronger. Also I can't believe they are selling this for 200 when the individual seasons are 20$ each... Making it 60$ for the same content as this set which is twice as expensive...,1370131200,3,470,4.674698795180723
3520052,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Batman the Animated Series is definitely my favorite version of Batman! This is the Batman I grew-up with, like many people grew up with the Tim Burton films or the Nolan films.

This Batman is the Batman who has everything. He has a great presence to him. Kevin Conroy is a big reason why this Batman is so memorable. Kevin Conroy probably has one of the most manly and intimidating voices I've heard. The problem with Christian Bale's Batman is that his voice is lame. This Batman also is a bad ass who is very witty and a great fighter. He is also a great detective. What the Burton and Nolan Batman lacked is the amazing intellect. Sure they were smart but not detectives. They are mainly fighter, and rely on their technology to solve the case for them. This Batman also does not kill. If you are not a fan of Batman killing people in Burton's Batman films, then you will like this Batman. This show is actually about Batman as well. If you do not like that about Burton's films, you do not have to worry about that here.

Another character that warrants mentioning is the Joker. The Joker in this show is my favorite incarnation of the Joker. Other Jokers like Heath Ledger are great. However, nothing beats Mark Hamill's take on the character. He is very funny when he's being silly, and terrifying when he is serious. His laugh is probably one of the best laughs in movie and television history, in my opinion. The other villains are good as well. They are quite loyal to the comics. Other villains in the show are actually improve from the comics. The villains are very much from a comic book. If you are a fan of Nolan's realistic universe, you may not like this. However, if you are not a fan of that universe you may find this refreshing.

The animation is great, especially for something from the 90s. The art, music,and atmosphere are well-done as well. The show has a darker atmosphere and is more serious. Even though this is marketed for children it has very adult and darker themes and elements. It also treats its audience with respect, unlike Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. Gotham looks very much like Gotham in the Burton movies. I really like this. This makes it more like a comic, even though this plays itself more serous. The action is also top notch.

Overall this is a must see if you are a fan of Batman. This Batman has something for every kind of Batman. It is more serious and dark, unlike Batman and Robin and Batman Forever. However, it still plays itself more like a comic book, from the look to the villains. It is not as over-the-top as the Schumacher films, and not as realistic as the Nolan films. It is right in the middle. To be honest, that is what I like about it. It is also very smart, despite being marketed to children. Adults as well as children can find enjoyment out of this. Do not let the fact that it is animated sway you. If you have the chance to pick this up do it!",1367193600,,2926,4.412962962962963
3520053,5,B001CTXUTQ,"I actually received mine as an 18th birthday present in 2008 and i still watch the series.
I cant believe the price went up so much, it's almost three times as much as it was back then.
However if i didn't already have it, i would probably purchase it. Its worth every penny!!
I recently purchased Batman Beyond - The Animated Series which I also enjoyed.
Perhaps the main reason why I bought it was because Kevin Conroy is so AMAZING!!!!!!
He is the voice I hear in my head when reading Batman Comics.
My next Series will probably be The Justice League / The Justice League Unlimited.
I'm not fond of Superman and don't care much for his character which I think is why I still don't have this series.

This might sound cheesy but ""They don't make them like they use to"".
I can't say there is any cartoon series up until now that can compare to this series.
If I ever have kids these will be their ""Saturday Morning Cartoons"".

3520067,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Next to the wonderful Fleischer Studios Superman cartoons of the 1940's, Batman: The AnimatedSeries is one of the best animated cartoon features ever produced. Before 1992, action-adventure animation was all but dead on American television. Following the success of its new comedy series TINY TOON ADVENTURES, Warner Animation President Jean MacCurdy made it known that they were looking to develop a new BATMAN animated series, a result no doubt from the success of the first Tim Burton Batman film. TINY TOON ADVENTURES storyboard artist Bruce Timm and background painter Eric Radomski were chosen to put together a sample reel, and their two-minute short netted them the jobs as the producers of the new series. Writers Alan Burnett and Paul Dini were brought in to spearhead the scripting of the series. Burnett and Dini shared Timm's vision of how the character should be portrayed: dark, serious and brooding.

The intentions for this new BATMAN series were made very clear in the series' pilot , ""On Leather Wings."" This was a Batman unlike any that had been previously seen in TV animation. Batman was a dark, psychologically driven detective character just as he was in the original and modern comic books.

The series was able to get away with a lot of ""real world violence"" such as punches, kicks and real guns being used. It also utilized serious and dark themes in its stories. This was groundbreaking for what ultimately amounted to a children's cartoon as that level of seriousness and realism had never been achieved in animation before.

The character design, primarily the work of Bruce Timm, along with artists Lynne Naylor, Kevin Nowlan and Mike Mignola, among others, eschewed the detail-heavy, ultra-real style favored by adventure cartoons in the past, in favor of a cartoonier approach, for lack of a better word, which combined the barrel chests and square jaws of the Fleischer Superman cartoons of the 1940s with the clean linework of comics legend, Alex Toth. The influence of such Batman artists as Bob Kane, Dick Sprang, Frank Miller and David Mazzuchelli is also evident.

Furthermore, the entire series was given a moody, timeless feel, in which 1940s architecture, wardrobe and roadsters co-existed with modern-day technology, making the series feel instantly nostalgic yet never dated.

The acting on the series was also amazing. Series voice director Andrea Romano opened the auditions up to the best actors available.  The casting for BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES resulted in what I believe to be the most talented cast ever assembled for an animated series. Voices included Kevin Conroy as Batman (the definitive voice of Batman in many people's minds), Mark Hammill as Joker (the definitive Joker voice), Lauren Lester as Robin and Bob Hastings as Commissioner Gordon among others.

The series, at least in its first incarnation, focused primarily on Batman fighting various rogues, with an 18-year-old Robin (attending college upstate as Dick Grayson) appearing infrequently and in a supporting role. The Robin design combined the Dick Grayson character with the current costume of the time worn by the comic books' third Robin, Tim Drake.

Much like the comics, however, Batman is only as good as his villains, and BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES did a marvelous job of translating Batman's Rogues' Gallery for animation, with far more hits than misses. In many cases, their version wound up being far superior to earlier versions, and often supplanted them not only in the public consciousness, but in the source-material comic books as well. Familiar characters like The Joker, Penguin, Two-Face, Catwoman, The Riddler, Clayface, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Man-Bat and Scarface are all featured with notable new characters like Lock-Up and Harley Quinn, who would become so popular that she would be featured in the comics eventually.

In it's original run, eighty-five episodes were produced for the FOX network before the series was taken off the air. A few years later, the studio ordered 27 more episodes, to coincide with the Superman animated series. In these NEW BATMAN ADVENTURES, characters were slightly re-designed and relaunched for the WB, with the addition of a new Robin, Tim Drake as well as Nightwing being introduced and Batgirl taking on a more prominent role. These new episodes were sleeker and more cartoony, a result of budget cuts, but these were still very entertaining. All in all, this series made many children and adults into lifelong Batman fans and comic book fans.",1352160000,3,4531,5.162125340599455

3520070,5,B001CTXUTQ,"This is still one of my favorite cartoons ever. Kevin Conroy is the quintessential Batman and Mark Hammil is an amazing Joker. This show was surprisingly dark for a kids cartoon series and every episode was great! The collection is made even greater by all the additional extras that come with it. The book is so well made and fantastic to read. Without hesitation, buy this set!",1348099200,,379,4.6716417910447765
3520071,5,B001CTXUTQ,"This is how Batman should be portrayed. I wish he was portrayed like this in the Justice League show. I feel he wasn't used there to his fullest potential. But that's just my opinion. BTAS is a legendary show that set new standards for animation, it was cutting edge for it's time. It's the est show in Batman's history as well as animation history. Well, in the U.S. at least. These episodes are worth multiple viewings. Especially those in the first season. I loved every episode so I can't really narrow down my favorites. All were fantastic in their own unique way. I loved the first season the most though if I really had to pick a favorite.

The extras:
The Legacy Continues - A great look back on the show. Also, a great retrospective on Batman's different incarnations and evolution. One of the highlights for me was when the guy said Heart Of Ic is easily one of the best stories ever told.

The Dark Knight's First Night - this was a pilot promo to promote the show. Before the footage aired, there was a text saying the original music had been lost. Too bad. Still great to see though.

Tour Of The Batcave - This was a cool feature. It contained bios on Batman and his gadgets. It would've been a bit more entertaining if this was spoken of by those who worked on the series as well as Bob Kane, Batman's creator.

Robin Rising - A good look at the evolution of the Robin. It was cool. Kind of felt a bit short for me though. I wish the guy who voiced Robin was present here to comment.

Gotham's Guardians - This covers the supporting cast of characters like Gordon, Bullock, etc. Like Robin Rising, comments from the individuals who voiced these characters would have been nice.

Voices Of The Knight - This feature is awesome thanks to the participation of Andrea Romano, the voice director as well as Adrienne
Barbeau, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Mark Hamill, and of course, Kevin Conroy who voiced Catwoman, Alfred, the Joker, and Batman respectively.

Gotham's New Knight - A feature on Batgirl. Like Robin Rising, it was good. Just felt somewhat short to me.

Arkham's Finest - A look at Batman's gallery of rogues. To me, Batman has the best rogues gallery of any DC character just like Batman is the epitome of heroism.

The Complete Collection of the et includes a Bonus Disc with. Documentary titled Shadea Of The Bat. This looks at the animated evolution of Batman. A good feature here. However, I feel this could have been added somewhere on the regular discss as a special feature rather than on a Bonus disc. Is it worth it to buy the complete series set? Depends on you.

Other special features include commentary on the follows episodes: On Leather Wings, Heart Of Ice, Robin's Reckoning, Heart Of Steel, Almost Got Em, Harley and Ivy, Read My Lips, House and Garden, Harlequinade, Over The Edge, Critters, Legends Of The Dark Knight.

Overall, a solid set. I suggest you get this since it is unknown right now as to whether the set will be released on bluray or not. And this is getting more and more rare as time goes on. Although you could buy the sets individually. However, if you do, you'll miss the bonus disc.",1344816000,2,3139,4.5380530973451325

But now that they have the complete series, I was excited and can watch it as much as possible. I was also fascinated that it comes with a booklet of sketches and artwork used for the series, and tips how to draw Batman, and learn interesting stories and facts on the series.

I was amazed on how fast the shipping service was. It arrived a few days early then what they estimated it should arrive. But there was one bit of a problem with the product itself, it came with something sticky on case of Volume 3 and 4, and it also has cracks, and small broken pieces. But the DVDs play fine, and are in excellent condition, but was ashamed it wasn't brand new when I ordered it. I would recommend on getting the complete series, but if ordering it new, I would probably first ask the seller if the product is really new and factory sealed, before purchasing it. Or ya might feel like you were cheated and lied to. So if you like glorious action and excitement with good storylines and animation, this be perfect for you. Service? Well that depends, I would think long and hard on this first. If getting it as ""new"" may ask the seller/s themselves if its really new, and not used. You wouldn't want to waste good money on a good product that turns out to be broken or used too much that it won't work anymore.",1326240000,,1467,4.258064516129032

3520080,1,B001CTXUTQ,"I have purchased this item from three different sellers and received bootleg versions from all three! Let me first state that a couple of these sellers were unaware they were selling bootlegs, and rightly so considering it was not apparent until after the box set was opened. Here is what to look for:

1) The obvious two issues reside on the outside slip cover - the word ""ANIMATED"" is spelled ""ANIMAED"" and the ""DC COMICS"" wording on the spine is spelled ""DC COMLCS.""

2) Two of the sets I received had the correct spellings on the slip cover, however, the word ""ANIMAED"" appeared on the booklet.

3) Whether the box set fell under #1 or #2 above, all box sets have a misspelling on the Bonus Features disc. It actually says, ""Bunus Disc.""

As I stated before, two of these sellers were completely unaware that the box sets they were selling had ""ANIMAED"" on the inside booklet. In fact, they were pretty outraged when they found out. With that being said, however, I would discourage anyone from buying this box set because it is way overpriced to have these sorts of issues.

3520082,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Batman is arguably the most well-known superhero ever. It seems everyone is familiar with at least one of The Dark Knight's incarnations, whether it's through the original 50's comics, the campy 60's TV show, the groundbreaking graphic novels by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frank-Miller/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frank Miller</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alan-Moore/dp/1401216676/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alan Moore</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeph-Loeb-Tim-Sale/dp/1563894696/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale</a>, the Burton/Schumacher/Nolan films, or the recent video game&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Arkham-Asylum/dp/B001E8VB6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a>&nbsp;(which is amazing by the way). The only other superheroes that come close are Spider-Man and Superman.  While all these versions of The Caped Crusader are great in their own way, I think the best one is still Batman: The Animated Series, one of the finest animated shows ever produced.

Batman: The Animated Series, or BTAS for short, is more than just a cartoon show. While it was marketed to kids due to the Batman name, I find the show to be just as enjoyable as when I watched it as a kid. As a kid, I enjoyed it strictly because it had Batman in it. As an adult, I was surprised to see how well it held up as a dark and mature show that is a fantastic addition to the Batman universe. I've got to hand it to the show's creators (Bruce Timm, Paul Dini, Kevin Altieri, etc) for doing such a good job and keeping the show's quality consistent throughout.

Where to start? The stories. The writing is outstanding with some great dialogue and interesting concepts. The characters are treated with respect, allowing for true character development - a remarkable feat for a cartoon. My favorite episode of the series is one entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Almost-Got-Im/dp/B0002ZMHWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Almost Got 'Im""</a>, where four of Batman's villains (The Joker, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, & Killer Croc) are playing poker and each one recalls a time where they ""almost"" succeeded in finishing off The Dark Knight. This episode manages to pack in four separate stories into a little under 30 minutes, all the while keeping it interesting and fun. Many other episodes deal with all kinds of ""grown-up"" issues, ranging from personal struggles between Batman and Robin to the trauma-induced insanity of Two-Face or Clayface. The show doesn't shy away from the various mental conditions of the villains, mentioning split personalities, delusions, and schizophrenia. Some stories included Robin, and he is usually a welcome addition. The series was later retitled ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"" and Robin was made a more prominent character at the request of Warner Bros, most likely to appeal to younger children. While this by no means affected the quality of the show, we all know that the core of the show is the character of Batman, not Robin.

The animation is top-notch - smooth and sleek. It has a modern film-noir style; the time period is never specifically stated, featuring a 1950's style setting with 50's era clothing and 50's model cars, while having some modern things (like computers and cell phones) present as well. I've always loved this aspect because it gives the show a timeless feel. Gotham itself is presented as a combination of the graphic novels and Burton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>, being a brooding place bathed in darkness with crime around every corner. The character designs are excellent, each being updated to a modern setting while still retaining facets of their classic look. Two-Face's scarred side is now blue instead of brown or red (presumably because it would've been too frightening for younger viewers), but I think this makes the character unique compared to his comic and film versions. The Penguin is more like the Danny Devito one from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Returns/dp/B000B5XOSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Returns</a>, but a little more gentlemenly sporting a monocle and more sophisticated demeanor. Also, Killer Croc is not green, but white for some reason - odd considering his name. Nearly all of these characters feel like they were ripped straight from the pages of the best Batman comics/graphics novels; it's amazing.

I think the one thing that stands out the most in BTAS is the sound effects & voice acting. The show has an amazing opening score by Danny Elfman, with other work by Shirley Walker. It was one of the only shows to have a theme composed by an orchestra. The score really immerses you in the show and makes it all the more enjoyable. The voice acting is the best of any animated show, bar none. Kevin Conroy is spectacular as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He gives Bruce Wayne a soothing voice, while giving Batman a deeper, more gravely voice. It's subtle but very effective. Mark Hammill is excellent as The Joker, playing him with a zany madness that fits the character beautifully. He is my all-time favorite incarnation of The Joker. Yep, better than Jack Nicholson's and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heath-Ledger-s/dp/B001GZ6QEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heath Ledger's</a>&nbsp;legendary performances. Every other voice actor does an amazing job, really making the character their own. Other standouts include John Glover as The Riddler and Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn (a character created for the show, who became so popular that she was integrated into all other forms of Batman media). One sound effect that I will always remember is the sound the Bat-Grappling Hook makes when it fires. The power behind it suited Batman's determination and incorruptible sense of justice perfectly, which is why I was frustrated when they used a different sound near the end of its run.

What else? I really can't think of anything bad to say about the show. There's nothing to nitpick or complain about. Subsequent Batman cartoons (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Batman/dp/B000CEXFZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Batman</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Brave-And-The-Bold/dp/B003M8NGLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Brave And The Bold</a>) have been good, but they can't hold a candle to the quality and impact that Batman: The Animated Series had on an entire generation and the Batman universe as a whole. Thanks Warner Bros. for creating such a superb animated show that everyone, whether they're 8 or 80, can thoroughly enjoy. This show is truly a masterpiece.",1290124800,4,7040,6.127659574468085

The vendor replaced it once cheerfully, then refused to do so again [did offer refund]. Warner Bros videos sent me a blow-off reply saying they didn't manufacture it and didn't sell it, so they won't support it. The manufacturer? Who knows and who can tell. It's not listed.

3520087,5,B001CTXUTQ,"The definitive version of Batman. Period. As I stated in an earlier review, its amazing that, when compared to the live-action movies and for all the bad episodes that came out of this series, they still maintained the level of mature storytelling they established early on. As usual, I'll give my overview on the actors but since this an animated series, I'll make a note on that as well (I don't review animated shows that often). Also since they didn't release these in ""season"" sets, I'll just detail each volume and my personal favorite episodes.

The actors have never been anything but the best. Voice director Andrea Romano really knows how to capture the essence of each character. Kevin Conroy, as many have stated, is the defining voice of Bruce Wayne/Batman. Others have taken the role since (Rino Romano, Deidrich Bader, Jeremy Sisto, etc.) but Conroy always tops the list. In the original episodes, he used one voice for Batman and a different one for Bruce (he slightly raised the pitch of his voice. Christian Bale should take a tip from him) and admittedly its something I missed when they did the revamped episodes. Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (Clive Revill for the first three episodes but he was good too) brings warmth and compassion to Alfred. It's something that those who've played the role in live-action capture (though Michael Gough hardly features in the four Burton/Schumacher) but other animated versions have always failed in my opinion. They either play him as your stereo-typical British butler (Filmation) or as a sarcastic butler who I wish would shut up (The Batman). Loren Lester's version of Dick Grayson/Robin/Nightwing, like Conroy, is the definitive version. He still displays his youthful vigor and ""gee-whiz"" personality that Burt Ward displayed but none of the annoying ""Holy insert obvious statement Batman!"" that Ward, Casey Kasem (excruciatingly in every Filmation/Super Friends episode), the boy who voiced him in The Batman (can't remember who did him there) and especially the every painful Chris O'Donnell. He still solves most of Riddler's puzzles easily but not to the point that it makes Batman look incompetent. Robin's portrayed as a sidekick who's trying to emerge on his own (evident in episodes like ""Robin's Reckoning"") but once they switch to the title ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"", they act like the best of friends. In the revamped series when he's Nightwing, you can tell there's a bitter relationship between Bruce and Dick that I'll get to when I talk about vol. 4. Bob Hastings' version of Commissioner Gordon is my favorite. He's a wise, smart and able policeman who's able to do things without the aid of Batman and at least tries to do so on more than one occasion. Another dimension is added when his daughter Barbara joins the cast and he really gets a chance to shine in one of my favorite episodes. I won't do the rest of the main/supporting cast as this review will go on forever but I will say they are excellent, especially Robert Costanzo's morally ambiguous Harvey Bullock.

The regular cast of villains is also amazing. Each person was able to bring their characters to life. There were some shaky starts, such as Diane Pershing's Poison Ivy. She felt a little wooden and not convincing but by the next time she appeared, she was perfect. Also the Scarecrow, who went from having a British accent (Henry Polic II) to having a low raspy voice (Jeffery Combs). Both versions are good, but, like the producers, I'd pick Combs' interpretation. It's far more scarier (even when compared to Batman Begins/The Dark Knight). Some villains with a goofy gimmick like Mr. Freeze and the Mad Hatter were given a new life by Michael Ansara and Roddy McDowall. Those two turned rather silly characters into three dimensional, sympathetic but still cruel villains. But my three favorite villain actors are Mark Hamill (the Joker), Arleen Sorkin (Harley Quinn) and John Glover (the Riddler). Hamill was able to blend the playfulness (as seen in Cesar Romero and early comics appearances) with the psychotic aspects (Jack Nicholson and 70s-90s comics), and though it was watched by children, I think he comes off as more intimidating and threatening than future animated and live-action incarnations. Arleen Sorkin's Harley, to me anyway, is a very complex character. Her relationship with the Joker is one of the greatest I've ever seen. Sorkin pulls that off well in episodes like ""Harley and Ivy"", ""Harlequinade"" and ""Mad Love"". But underneath all of Joker's menace, he deeply cares for her. Why else would he keep her around (evident in ""Harlequinade"")? John Glover's Riddler is the complete opposite of Frank Gorshin, Jim Carrey and previous animated versions. He's highly intelligent psychopath who's obsessed with outwitting Batman, which he considers a game. His finest moment is in his final episode ""Riddler's Revenge"" which I'll get to in a minute. Like the main/supporting cast, there are far too many actors to complement but while a lot of the actors are good (Kate Mulgrew) their characters came off as bland (Red Claw).

Animation wise, its always been great. Granted, the revamped series was far more consistent in terms of character design and I'm glad they got rid of Gordon's up-curl. The original character designs however were my favorite, as they seemed more like classic Batman. The Bat-signal logo has been a defining trademark since 1964 and it was disappointing when they removed it for the basic black bat but most of the time, the size and shape of the oval and bat was inconsistently distracting. The Dick Grayson Robin costume was also more preferred, like I said, it was classic Batman, but I don't know why in the episode commentary, the producers complain that they never had a decent green to go on the green parts of the Robin costume, saying they had to use some bluish-green instead and saying it was a shadow or some comment of the like. If that was the case, they should've just colored those areas black though they clearly had a decent green color Poison Ivy and Riddler and in part one of ""Robin's Reckoning"", his sleeves and leg areas are a decent green. But then in part two, it's the bluish-green. That's pretty sad when they couldn't get the same animation studio to do both parts of the story. The only one I really didn't like was Penguin as they were clearly modeling him after Danny DeVito, so I was glad when they redesigned him to look more sophisticated. A lot of characters I was glad for the more streamlined animation (Batman, Batgirl, Gordon, Bane, Clayface, Killer Croc, Scarecrow and Poison Ivy) others I wish stayed the same. I missed Joker's red lips, as that's one of the recognizable traits of the character. I hated Catwoman's all black look as she practically vanished against dark backgrounds. Riddler was put back into his tights, reminiscent of earlier comics appearances, but the business suit made him look distinguished. I don't know why they shortened Mad Hatter and made him look like a rat faced human being and changed his hair white but it was far too distracting.

Now onto the series. Right from the start, the series hooks you. The title card of ""On Leather Wings""; the haunting music, the white background with a black bat flapping its wings. Vol. 1 introduces most of the cast of heroes and villains (Scarecrow's practically done with this set though he makes cameos throughout and has 2 episodes in the revamped series). Unfortunately, some villains don't get decent introductions, like Penguin in the reviled episode ""I've Got Batman in my Basement"" in which he gets beaten by kids! Come on I know you've censors to deal with but when you've got an umbrella full of nerve gas at your disposal, it falls flat. Especially when Burgess Meredith's Penguin almost electrocuted Chief O'Hara in the '60s series. Some of my favorites include ""Nothing to Fear"", ""Two-Face"", ""It's Never Too Late"", ""Heart of Ice"", ""See No Evil"", ""Beware the Grey Ghost"",  ""The Clock King"" and ""Mad as a Hatter"". Most feature the regular super villains and have good scripts, but others were great because of strong stories of redemption (""It's Never Too Late"") or great guest stars AND a great story (""Beware the Grey Ghost"").

Vol. 2 still delivers with good stories yet more weaker episodes are present such as ""Off Balance"" (the only notable thing about that is the set-up of Ra's al Ghul and Talia), ""Moon of the Wolf"", ""The Mechanic"" (which has the Penguin remote controlling/stealing the Batmobile. Didn't he do that in the `60s series AND Batman Returns?) and the two episodes featuring the Ninja. Stronger episodes include ""Birds of a Feather"" which deal with Penguin wanting to be accepted by society. Also, featuring my favorite villain; ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich"" which is Riddler's animated origin story featuring some great riddles and his follow-up episode ""What is Reality?"" which shows, in my opinion anyway, how psychotic Nigma really is, to go and destroy any information or knowledge of his real identity. ""Almost Got `Im"", one of the fan-favorites, is one I won't go into too much detail about as others have in other reviews and I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it either but I will say it features some of the series' greatest villains. Other great episodes are ""Perchance to Dream"", ""The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy"", ""The Laughing Fish"", ""The Man Who Killed Batman"" and ""Harley and Ivy"".

Vol. 3 features the fewest weak episodes. ""Shadow of the Bat"" really only serves to introduce Batgirl while ""Avatar"", ""Make `Em Laugh"", ""Time Out of Joint"", ""Baby-Doll"", ""The Lion and the Unicorn"" (which felt James Bond-esque) and a few others were sub-par, either because the story or villain wasn't strong enough to complement each other. The only downright terrible episode (""I've Got Batman in my Basement"" at least had some charm to it despite its flaws) the series ever produced was ""The Terrible Trio"", which is just...terrible. The villains are boring, the voice actors who do the villains make them come off as annoying and Batman & Robin really could've solved this in half the time it takes for this episode to end. The rest of the episodes are great. Fan-favorite ""The Demon's Quest"" finally brings Ra's al Ghul to the forefront (this, ""Avatar"" and ""Showdown"" are the only episodes that he really stars in, which is a shame as I'm pretty sure he could've given the Justice League a run for their money a lot better than Lex Luthor). The story is strong, the animation is fantastic and the voice acting is amazing, David Warner being a particular stand-out as Ra's. ""Deep Freeze"" is Mr. Freeze's second appearance in 70 episodes and while its good, it doesn't hold up as well as ""Heart of Ice"". It does however set up the fantastic animated movie ""Subzero"" (far superior than Batman & Robin).  ""Trial"" is one of my favorites, mainly because it features practically every regular Batman villain (though why Riddler vanishes half-way through has never been fully explained as far as I've read on various website reviews on this episode). ""Harlequinade"" and ""Harley's Holiday"" feature some great bits for Harley as its revealed she's not all bad and when she's been released from Arkham, she actually aspires to reform. With ""Catwalk"", we finally get a great Catwoman episode with the way she's supposed to be portrayed; as a villain. Sure she's not downright evil like Killer Croc or Bane, mentally insane like Joker or Riddler and at least has a moral standard, but I've never liked the whole ""anti-hero"" thing that they`ve done in the comics. They kind of got it right in the recent animated series ""The Batman"" but most of the time (mainly because of her voice) it fell flat. She's a jewel thief through and through who, like Poison Ivy, fights for a cause and will go to any lengths to achieve her goals. Though I don't know why Batman always lets his defences down around her, especially since she pulled the whole ""cuddle up then kick him in the gut"" ploy back in her very first episode. Then there's ""Riddler's Reform"", possibly my all-time favorite episode out of the original series. Not only does it feature some great riddles and deathtraps (and a convenient deus ex machina), but John Glover brings out Riddler's full insanity. It's downplayed at first but at the very end is when he lets loose his anger. It's also the last episode to really feature the Riddler, the revamped episodes featuring two cameos and then a third in ""Superman: TAS"", the main reason being that the writers found the Riddler a difficult character to write for, the character making stories too long or complex, which makes me wonder why didn`t they just do multi-part episodes if he made them too long? Other great episodes are ""Blind as a Bat"", ""Read My Lips"", ""The Worry Men"", ""A Bullet For Bullock"", ""House and Garden"" and ""Second Chance"". The original series ends with ""Batgirl Returns"" an OK episode and another great feature for Catwoman as a villain, but it deserved to go out on a higher note. This wasn't the final episode aired as these sets have them in production order which make a lot more sense. The first aired episode (on 9/5/1992)  was ""Cat and the Claw"" part 1 and the second part  didn't air until the 7th. Now this was back when new episodes aired daily so there were several episodes in between and eventually one episode weekly (meaning the ""real"" last episode is ""The Lion and the Unicorn"", a weaker episode when compared to ""Batgirl Returns""), so in terms of continuity and the like, I'll stick with the production order.

Vol. 4 is the revamped episodes and probably contains the weakest episodes like; ""Love is a Croc"", ""Torch Song"", ""The Ultimate Thrill"", ""Mean Seasons"", ""Cult of the Cat"", ""Animal Act"", ""The Demon Within"", ""Girls Nite Out"" (has some great comedic bits from Harley, I just find Livewire annoying) and ""Chemistry"". And of course there's the most hated episode in the entire DCAU: ""Critters"", it's a weird episode and I don't think it fits into what the producers' original vision but I don't outright hate it. Is it a good episode? No. But I think it's a lot better than ""The Terrible Trio"". Stronger episodes include ""Cold Comfort"" in which we finally learn Mr. Freeze's ultimate fate, ""Double Talk"" where the Ventriloquist's storyline comes to an end (for now anyway), ""Never Fear"" featuring Scarecrow's corpse makeover, ""You Scratch My Back"" is the first episode to feature Nightwing & another great Catwoman episode and ""Old Wounds"" where we finally learn what led Dick Grayson to leave the team. Some personal favorites are ""Joker's Millions"" and ""Beware the Creeper"" are real fun episodes and have some great Joker and Harley moments. ""Judgment Day"", next to his first episode and ""Second Chance"" is probably Two-Face's finest episode, featuring some great twists. ""Over the Edge"" is a great ""what if"" episode. Featuring great performances from everyone involved, Bob Hastings imparticular as he really shows how hurt and betrayed he is by Batman and will go to any length to kill him. This is possibly the darkest episode the series has ever done. ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" and ""Mad Love"" are great episodes but since they've been praised enough by others, I won't do it here (though they deserve all the praise they've received).

All in all, a series with fantastic writing, musical scoring, acting and animation and the right talent behind it all to bring it together to make it the classic it is today, along with its subsequent spin-offs (Batman starring or guest-starring in most, if not all of them).",1276473600,,15628,4.886543535620053
3520088,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Okay, I was a young child when this came out, but ever since it's original run, I was watching this RELIGOUSLY!! Now I am 21 years old, and I've got to tell you, out of all the boxsets I have bought thus far this is by far the best. I love the casing, art book, and all the episodes are just the way I remembered them with a step up on the quality of the picture. I just started to watch the series again, and from what I can tell, the people who put this set together knew exactly what they were doing. My only real gripe about the boxset, and it's not really anything that they can do about it since the original was this way, Is that there was no actual sense of contiuity. It was just from one adventure to the next, as if the other adventures didn't even take place. This isn't THAT big of an issue, but contiuity is something that I am sort of used to considering I watch ALOT of anime...

But onward with the reiview! Every episode is here and it looks better than ever!  This series is a MUST have for any fan of The Bat, young and old. From what I could remember of the series there was a bit of blood every so often, but it wasn't like an every episode occurance. DEFINTIELY let your kids see this! This is definitely a hallmark to American Animation that should be praised by everyone. I guess one of the main reasons I love this series so much is because I grew up watching it every day after school from Kindegarden all the way to about Fifth grade. Which was most of the original run time, Including The New Adventures of Batman.

This series includes EVERY episode of the Animated Series and The New Adventures of Batman (After Dick Grayson Robin.). I have to say that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil are still the greatest pair for Batman and the Joker, respectively, The two have always been considered as such in my book even still to this day. I will admit this was an impulse by since I have finished Arkham Ayslum. The Iconic duo have in fact reprised their roles for those of you who haven't bought, and played the game.

Unfortunately, I do not know if they are still printing this, or not, but I have my copy and I am VERY satisfied with my copy. If I have ended up with a last copy I am a very lucky man, and will definitly enjoy it.",1274313600,,2254,4.162844036697248

The series was praised while it was on and I believe that it should be praised still.  If your thinking of buying this, just do it.

""Batman- the Animated Series"" came in early on the heels of Tim Burton's massively successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;film and has aged better then every other cartoon of it's day.  In fact, it still looks as good or better than every current American cartoon show.  Animation and art aside, it had a better cast, better scores, and better overall presentation and tone then almost any other show on television at all, then or now.  This show is what made me realize that there is so much more to the Caped Crusader then just movies and corny 60's television.  This show made the character a legend in my young mind and launched an assault from DC comics that has seen them absolutely destroy Marvel Comics on the animation front for over 15 years.

The cast is amazing.  Kevin Conroy puts every other Batman voice to shame (I'm looking at you, Bale) and Mark Hammil's Joker is still my overall favorite incarnation.  Add a very sexy-voiced Adrienne Barbeau, Ron Perlman, Ed Asner, and a ton of other voice actors perfect in their roles and you have show with serious personality.  Even Adam West himself gets an episode of his own.  The material consisted of both all-new stories and adaptations of classic comic adventures from all the way back to the 40's to the 80's.  One of the show's original characters, Harley Quinn, became so beloved that she was written into the comics and has since become a player in the DC Universe, and bit player Renee Montoya found her way into the comics as well. Even the lesser villain found new life in this series, which handled them with respect and reinvented them in new and interesting ways. Even The Condiment King makes an appearance. Other classic lesser-known DC heroes guested in special episodes including Zatanna and Jonah Hex, which started a trend that would carry over into&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B000F5WR4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Animated Series</a>&nbsp;and eventually lead to the spectacularly awesome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League/dp/B000JBXH9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Unlimited/dp/B000LE179S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League Unlimited</a>, effectively creating the ultimate animated comic book universe. So yeah, ""Batman- The Animated Series"" is quite possibly the most influential cartoon of our era and it mandatory viewing for all fans of the character.

I'm going to break down each season by listing my favorite episodes.  seasons 1-3 feature amazing  art and animation, but when the series came back after a hiatus to run concurrent with the Superman series, the art took a nosedive as the character designs were ""streamlined"" or often changed entirely and never for the better.  That said, you still can't argue with the flawless storytelling which remained through all four seasons.  Here we go:

Season 1
""On Leather Wings"" opens the series in style.  Man-Bat looks amazing and the flying sequence is masterpiece.  Not bad from an old-school horror standpoint either.
""The Last Laugh"" is probably my favorite episode of all.  The score is unforgettable and this episode features some of the best moments in the entire series for me.
""The Cat and the Claw"" was a two-parter and the first appearance of Catwoman.  Adrienne Barbeau is absolutely flawless in the part and I think this is the best adaptation of the character by far.
""Feat of Clay"" is another two-parter that introduces the shapeshifter Clayface's origin.  There is some truly amazing animation here and a lot of homages to classic Hollywood.
""Heart of Ice"" is a brilliant re-imagining of Mr. Freeze, previously a throwaway villain.  The story told is fantastic and tragic.
""Joker's Favor"" is one of the best episodes featuring the Clown Prince of Crime and the first appearance of his on-again-off-again girlfriend/henchwoman Harley Quinn.

Season 2
""Heart of Steel"" is a great work of science fiction that pays homage to classics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UBMSB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/B000QQJ3Q0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>&nbsp;over two episodes.
""Day of the Samurai"" has Bruce Wayne travelling to Japan to assist his former sensei against a former classmate of his, now a vengeful ninja seeking a deadly forbidden martial art.
""Almost Got 'im"" features some of Batman's greatest foes trading stories about times they almost killed The Dark Knight.  Massively entertaining.
""Harley and Ivy"" is the beginning of a long-running friendship between two of Batman's more popular female villains.  It's an idea that served this series very well indeed.

Season 3
""Shadow of the Bat"" is the two-parter that gives us Batgirl.  Her and Robin were used refreshingly sparsely until season four, and wound up being great characters in small doses.  Here they are great together.
""The Demon's Quest"" is a two-parter that has Ra's al Ghul and his daughter Talia-who shares a mutual affection with The Caped Crusader- traveling the world together with Batman before he realizes that al Ghul is a true villain who works on a much larger scale then any he has met before and gains a deadly foe.
In ""Trial"", a DA who hated Batman is forced to defend him from the criminals she thinks he created when the two are kidnapped and tried by the residents of Arkham Asylum.  Joker is the judge, of course.
""Baby Doll"" features a pint-sized sitcom star villain of the same name who should have been cartoonishly ridiculous. And for a while she is. But the episode actually wound up being touching in the end as the woman who can never grow up finally breaks character and spills her torment all over the Batman.  Surprisingly powerful.
""Riddler's Reform"" was one of very few episodes featuring the character in a large role.  Rather than rehash his riddle-crimes, the episode chooses to examine the psychology of a genius mind capable of the perfect crime that has a self-destructive pathological impulse to give himself away.  Great character study.

Season 4
""You Scratch My Back' shows us that Dick Grayson is no longer Robin, but Nightwing and he teams up with Catwoman in this one.
""The Ultimate Thrill"" has The Dark Knight taking on Roxie Rocket, a stuntwoman-turned thief who gets practically-sexual thrills from Batman chasing her.  Great episode.
""Over The Edge"" is a pitch black nightmare from Batgirl's mind as she struggles with the possible consequences of her double life.  Possibly the darkest episode in a dark series.
""Old Wounds"" finally reveals the cause of the break between Batman and the original Robin.  Great story.
""Legends of the Dark Knight"" was remade on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Gotham-Knight/dp/B001614E68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman Gotham Knight)</a>&nbsp;anime DVD.  It features a group of kids trading stories of diffeent adaptations of Batman.  One is a straight-out-of-the-60's Superfriends cheesefest and another is literally ripped from the pages of Frank Miller's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>.  An awesome episode for real Batfans.
""Girls Night Out"" is a crossover featuring Supergirl and Batgirl taking on one of Superman's more interesting villains, Livewire plus Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy.  Good fun.
""Mad Love"" is Harley's origin story and was originally a comic released by the team after season three and was a big hit with fans.  When season four came out after several years, they got a chance to animate it and the result is not disappointing.

This killer boxed set includes an extra disc of bonus features including a half-hour look at Batman's different animated incarnations, a booklet fiiled with amazing artwork, an episode list, and a history of the seires.

3520097,5,B001CTXUTQ,"As someone who has followed Bruce Timm and Paul Dini's animated DC Universe since its inception, I had surprisingly little of it in my DVD collection. This collection of Batman really does provide the viewer with the ultimate experience.

Sure there are a few clunkers here and there (most Penguin episodes, a few that are deliberately watered down for young children, etc.) but the rest are phenomenal (Heart of Ice, Robin's Reckoning, The Demon's Head, etc.).

For myself, some of the best treats (after reviewing all my childhood memories, of course) is getting into the commentaries and hearing the stories behind the episodes.

Now, I am not a fan of the animation ""streamlining"" in the final volume. As much as I loved some of the redesigns (Scarecrow in particular), it just seems cheap to me.

So overall, great collection. You'll get almost nothing new if you already own the individual volumes, but if you have never bought Batman: TAS DVDs before, start here!",1238457600,5,970,4.932515337423313

The only thing that stopped me from giving the product 5-stars was the design of the DVD holders.  It is very flimsy, and one of the cases broke on the inside, so I have to be careful whenever I move the whole set.

This series marked a turning point of Warner's stable of super heroes in animation, and those of us who were still reading the comics took note. I bought all the seasons as they came out, and bought the boxed set as a Christmas present to myself in 2008. The shows are a bit dark for young kids, but perfect for kids 8 and over. What's so great about these versions as opposed to the 'Super Friends'? Where to begin. First, the whole look of the series has a wonderful contrast of modern tech and a retro style that has art deco influences. The show has a moody lighting and colour palette evocative of 1930s posters from eastern Europe. Second, the writing and voice acting is superb. The dialogue and situations are sophisticated and respect the intelligence of viewers. Finally, this series, as I've alluded to, became the starting point of a rebirth of WBs animation that saw Superman and the Justice League retooled to wonderful new series. Not to repeat other reviewers observations, but I agree that with the exception of Max Fleisher's Superman cartoons of the late 30s, this series helped set the bar for it's genre.

3520103,5,B001CTXUTQ,"The 90's Batman Animated Series' are easily the best to have come out to date. The style -- especially in the first three seasons -- is ideal, and very accurately reflects the characterisation, style and historical incarnations of the Dark Knight, his foes and his allies.
Kevin Conroy (again, especially in the first three seasons) is the perfect voice of Bruce Wayne and Batman. Shifting between two very different tones for the contrasting figures of Wayne and Batman, you really get the sense that it's so much a case of Bruce Wayne being Batman, but that Wayne and Batman are two very different people.
It also makes it more believable that Commissioner Gordon could talk to both Bruce Wayne and Batman without making the connection that they're both the same man.
If you do not currently own any of this brilliant series, this is by far the best way to buy it: with all four seasons, as well as bonus DVD and book. While the book doesn't contain all that much, it does show many interesting concept sketches which do illustrate how much thought -- and indeed fandom -- when into presenting Batman in the best possible manner.

He's darker then Jack Nicholson but also has more of a humor to him then Heath Ledger's character.  And the multiple evil laughs he does is great (Mark Hamilton gives us some insight in that in one of the extras).

3520117,5,B001CTXUTQ,"This is the series that introduced me (and I imagine a lot of other kids as well) to one of DC Comic's most recognizable icons. I watched this show everyday, and Batman was one of my heroes. Released in 1992 and produced by Bruce Timm and head writer Paul Dini, Batman: the Animated Series was revolutionary for its time, portraying the character and his world in ways that the films at the time (and arguably the ones being released now) never managed.

While based on the character's entire comic book history, the series mostly draws inspiration from the stories of the 1970's created by writers and artists such as Denny O'Neil, Neal Adams, Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers, among many others. It also draws inspiration from the 1940's Superman cartoons for its general look, and the show itself has a retro-1940's look to the characters and architecture that is instantly memorable and atmospheric. Batman is depicted with real human emotions, strengths and flaws, and the light and dark aspects of the character are portrayed with depth. Kevin Conroy voices the Dark Knight to perfection, providing two distinct voices for the Bruce/Batman persona. His voice is dark and menacing without being over the top like Christian Bale's, and his is the voice I hear when I read the comics.

As if depicting the title character so wonderfully weren't enough, this series did a stellar job with his supporting cast. Butler Alfred Pennyworth, side kick Robin (who isn't nearly as annoying here as he sometimes can be), Commissioner Gordon and the Gotham Police, and his daughter Barbara/Batgirl all make appearances, and are all portrayed accurately and with style. All of Batman's major classic villains make appearances as well. Not only do they bring in the classics such as Catwoman, the Penguin, Two-Face, the Riddler and the Scarecrow, but the series revitalized formerly campy characters such as Poison Ivy, Clayface, the Mad Hatter and (most memorably) Mr. Freeze and turned them into genuine threats with compelling and human motivations. But stealing the show is the Joker, with an amazing performance by Mark ""Luke Skywalker"" Hamill, who strikes just the right balance between the Clown Prince's menace and humor. He is also occasionally joined by a female counterpart, the series-original character Harley Quinn, is a fun and complex character in her own right.

This set includes the entire series on 16 discs, along with a decent amount of bonus material. If you haven't purchased the four individual sets, you might as well get them all in one go. I highly recommend this series to any true Batman fan or fans of film and animation in general. It is Batman in his purest form, accept no substitutes.",1234224000,,2712,4.995575221238938
3520118,5,B001CTXUTQ,"This set was not quite what I expected. First the packaging was amazing. I thought I would be receiving a dinky cardboard thing with a bunch of discs in it like most other tv shows on dvd I've bought, but the durability of the outer case along with the designs on them were great. On top of that, there's a wonderful plastic sleeve for it. As for the discs themselves, they come in two separate boxes of eight discs each and they can be flipped through like a book - incredibly convenient. However, what is not convenient that the episodes are not ordered by air date. Rather they are organized by production number. So I was a bit confused when on the first episode there was only batman, the next had robin, then there was no robin again. But this is just a minor problem. The availability of the episodes in airdate order is so readily available online that if you want to view it in order you just need to consult that list and have the patience to switch discs frequently. Plus the price on amazon is quite a bargain for anyone who wants to have the entire Batman:TAS on DVD.",1234051200,,1080,4.351485148514851
3520119,5,B001CTXUTQ,"I am 16 and was treated to skepticism upon expressing my desire to purchase this godly collection of pristine animation, but promptly ignored it and regret nothing.

True, this set is expensive. BUT!
Let me tell you a little about my research I considered before buying this box set..

[...]

Now, you can also look into eBay, etc. But guess what? You aren't going to save much money there either, I looked, and I know.
Now, what interests me that here on Amazon is the only place I found or heard of this box set. I was delightfully surprised.

This set has everything that the full set on WB offers, PLUS it is boxed, comes with the art book, and comes with an extra disk of special features. And the astounding part? It is roughly HALF THE PRICE. The deal is impeccable and you literally cannot find a better deal anywhere else. Try.

I was flabbergasted at such an incredible offer and immediately placed my order. My set came 3 days later (it was shipped on a Saturday and I had to wait until the following Monday to receive it). I was not unimpressed, or disappointed. My order came in a cardboard box, securely fit with more cardboard, and shrink-wrapped. The case was pretty nice, though is made of tough cardboard as well, but it is not a problem. The art book is interesting, and lists the episodes per disk as well. Inside the box is (as displayed in the picture) two dvd cases with two volumes per case. You really do get what you see.

I recommend any real Batman fan to invest in this set, the episodes are action-packed and better than any cartoon show still on the air today. The animation really is an art, and the images, scenery, and design really are beautiful.
Plus, there are A LOT of episodes. I watch roughly 2 to 6 a day and, well, there are 109 episodes, at roughly 22 minutes per episode. So you get roughly 2398 minutes, or about 39.9 hours worth. If you REALLY would like to break things down, you are paying about $0.75 per episode, plus getting the bonus features, case, and convenience of owning them personally. Plus, every time you re-watch an episode you are decreasing the money you spent per view. Just to get statistical. :]

In short, BUY THIS if you are interested in buying anything to do with Batman: TAS. This is literally the best deal online (and probably otherwise). The shipping/handling from Amazon was fine, nothing to worry about. This is one of the few amazing deals you will ever encounter, so be sure to take advantage!",1233705600,2,2472,4.504464285714286
3520120,4,B001CTXUTQ,"This was a Christmas present for my husband. And, even though our 5 year old kinda spoiled the surprise, he was excited to receive it and watched almost all of it 1 sitting.",1233100800,,173,4.2727272727272725

3520135,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Earlier last year, I was contemplating getting all the seasons to Batman: The Animated Series as I had got all the seasons of The Batman and was craving more animated action. Well, I'm glad I waited as I ended up getting a better deal with Batman-The Complete Animated Series. Originally airing from 1992 to 1995, Batman: The Animated Series raised the bar on animation by giving us a world that centered on characters that we could relate to and real-life drama making Batman an even more believable character. Warner Bros. has put the entire 4-season run into a 17-disc box set. I know what you're wondering right now: Is it any good? Is it worth my hard-earned money when times are hard right now?? To answer those questions, yes and yes. Classic episodes like ""Heart of Ice"", ""The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne"", ""If You're So Smart, Why Aren't you Rich?"", ""The Demon's Quest(Pts. 1&2)"", ""Shadow of the Bat"", ""Bane"", ""The Terrible Trio"", ""A Bullet for Bullock"", ""The Lion and The Unicorn"" & ""Beware The Grey Ghost"" are all included in the collection. There are plenty of extras with many featurettes, commentaries and interviews by cast and crew. There's trivia and more.

Inspired by the old Fleischer Superman cartoons and Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film, it is much more adult-oriented in it's content and whatnot, it appealed to both kids and adults & is widely considered the 'best' and closest adaptation of the original Batman series published by DC Comics.

The two-time Emmy Award winning series was produced by Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, and Eric Radomski. It was voiced by Kevin Conroy, Loren Lester, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., Bob Hastings, Mark Hamill, Melissa Gilbert, Marilu Henner, Adrienne Barbeau, Paul Williams, Diane Pershing, Henry Silva, Roddy McDowall, Ron Perlman(yes, of Hellboy fame), Marc Singer among others. Supporting voices included: Ed Asner, Abe Vigoda, Helen Slater, Treat Williams, and Michael York. The show itself spawned other spin-offs series such as Superman: The Animated Series, The Batman-Superman Adventures, Batman Beyond, Static Shock, The Batman, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited and the flash animated Internet only Gotham Girls.

I, personally, love this collection and am glad that Warner decided to bring it to us. There's no denying that this series has a profound effect on how storytelling and animation is done in this day and age. That's why it will always be a fan favorite amongst all.",1231718400,,2447,5.082089552238806

3520140,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Batman - The Complete Animated Series is a good collection for old Batman fans who grew up watching the cartoons in the nineties and for a new generation of Batman fans.

Top notch voice acting from Kevin Conroy (who's still the best Batman) and Mark Hamill (as the Joker).

This is a great collection for people like me, who've always wanted the entire series, but didn't want to buy it one season at a time. Now you can have all four seasons in one collectors box (at a better price) to keep and prize.

There really is no complaint to how WB designed the collection. I guess maybe for some, this might take up space on the shelf, but so what?! It's Batman! I love the black case it comes in and how the four seasons are divided into two DVD boxes. The bonus features are always interesting to listen, you understand just how difficult it is to make a cartoon with all the limits of censorship and budget, but you also get to appreciate the input from the producers and actors on how the project came together. Little things like how the series was able to have its own fully conducted music, adds depth to the animation.

I'm glad I bought this collectors edition, the photo book that comes with it is great to browse through to view the artwork from the cartoon. And to be honest, this series transcends any cartoon that's on TV right now. And in my opinion, it's always been the best interpretation of Batman.

It's almost too bad that there were only four seasons, but if you get Batman Beyond, that extends the amazing voice acting of Kevin Conroy to three more seasons. And you can bet I bought all three seasons of Batman Beyond.",1231286400,,1638,4.428571428571429

I doubt I can write anything here that other reviewers have not written already.  This is probably one of the greatest animated TV series ever.  It has great writing, animation, voice acting, and with this particular set, it has a great presentation.

I waited to purchase the DVD sets that previously came out because I either rented them or borrowed them from friends.

3520166,5,B001CTXUTQ,"I have received this fantistic Batman DVD set as a Christmas present.

As a child i used to watch Batman - The animated series on TV, although here in Germany the series was never really appreciated by the audience  and, sooner than later,  got cancelled.

This DVD box is indeed an investment, a positive one by all means.
Once you have opened the box ( it`s like opening a chess board ) you hold a collector`s book in you hands, listing all the content of 17 discs as well as sketches of the  producers !

The discs itslf are held within some sort of vhs-like packaging which , however, is still better than the new digipacks because the discs don`t overlap. Instead you can "" turn pages "" like you use to with a book and access each of the 17 discs separately.
All in all, the package alone is worth the money spent on this set.

Video transfer is still 4:3 and not 16:9 as I had hoped. However this shouldn`t be an issue at all considering the fact that you buy this DVD collection for entertainement, which it is considering the over 35 hours of Batman animation and the clear and crisp DVD picture quality.
Not to mention the 8 in-depth featurettes and many,many other extras on the never-before released bonus disc.

If you are a Batman animated series fan than buy this collection, especially if you`re not living in the USA, because who knows for how long it will still be available.",1230163200,,1392,4.431372549019608
3520167,5,B001CTXUTQ,"If you're browsing this page you probably already enjoy Batman: The Animated Series, the Justice League series and are working your way backwards through the DC mythos, or have a friend or relative who loves the Caped Crusader. So I'll save my extended review of the series itself and simply give some tidbits.

1. The identity, direction, music, voice acting and scope of the show is marvelous.

2. The Joker depicted in this series was the most accurate presentation of the character until The Dark Knight this year. He borders on the psychotic and has so much fun in everything he does while still remaining disciplined and vigilant in pushing Batman to the limits of his self-control. Other characters such as Mr. Freeze, Catwoman and The Riddler somehow manage to be 'cartoony' and yet more serious than the pitiful Hollywood attempts to encapsulate them thus far.

3. Kevin Conroy's voice is the one I've associated with Batman since I was 8 years old, and fortunately despite several studio and direction changes in the DC cartoon production schedule he lends his voice from season 1 of Batman all the way through the end of Justice League: Unlimited.

Now onto the collection itself. Warner Bros. got this right for once; the collection is sharp and attractive and makes a fantastic collectible for any fan of the series. I was so impressed with the appearance of the set I bought another copy for the young son of my best friend.

There's a thick plastic cover with silver-lined bats on one side and a backdrop of Gotham on the other as well as the title of the series and of course Batman, all of whom jump off the cover with vibrant action. The box itself is finely crafted too, in finished black with various scenes of Batman on the top and inside cover. Inside, you're greeted by a double-wide collectible book detailing the episode list as well as showing exciting scenery from the show and sketches of Batman's character. Underneath, the discs are contained in 2 dependable cases that look like they will protect the series over time, and at just over twice the size of a normal DVD case, allow you to store the series with the rest of your collection and put the box set away if you're hard up for shelf space.

Pros:
* The show rocks.
* The set feels and looks excellent, even people who have no ties or interest in the show will acknowledge it as a great looking gift.
* The set is durable and includes the entire series.
* The show is as watchable as an adult for different reasons as a child, so it's easy to justify the purchase even if it's for yourself.

Cons:
* No set contains the entire collection of Batman, Superman, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited episodes.
* Your girlfriend, wife, family or friends may wonder why you're rewatching cartoons from your childhood in their entirety.
* Warner Bros. is notorious for not touching up the quality of damaged material, and the first season of this collection isn't as sharp, bright and gorgeous as the rest of the cartoon. You'll notice a few flaws.
* The set is full-screen.

Overall my expectations were exceeded for this product. Typically these days as a consumer I feel like I'm asking too much just to have an entire series accessible and affordable all in one place, but with this set you've got that as well as a genuinely attractive collectible that, along with the series itself, should stand the test of time. For me personally, Batman: The Animated Series along with Justice League Unlimited represents the pinnacle of American episodic cartoons.",1229990400,6,3543,4.7216828478964405

If you already have one or all of these seasons on DVD, give them to a friend or family member to try and turn them on to this series.  You could even take the individual seasons you already own and sell them through ebay or a used CD/DVD store to try and recover some of your cost.

I remember when it did debut originally in Primetime on Fox, it was like an even in my household--Dad, Mom, my siblings--the show was just that good.

They stopped showing it on Disney's cartoon network (or at least maybe it moved from the 7-8 time slot on Sunday nights that I managed to catch it on), so I broke down earlier this year and just got the bundle that Amazon was offering when it lowered for about $85.

I thought that nod toward diversity was awesome, sorely lacking in the films. Great show.",1224806400,4,558,4.59
3520183,5,B001CTXUTQ,"Frontier could not have written a better review. As a pre-teen I watched the campy Adam West series, then the Saturday morning cartoon versions. Finally in 1989 the Michael Keaton movies set the tone for this venue that finally got the story right.

Wouldn't you know it that I just bought the third and fourth volumes separately after having had the first two for some time. It was all worth the price I paid even for the separate volumes, so this boxed set comes a fantastic deal. I have the Batman series and got a great deal from Amazon for ordering the three volumes of the Superman series together. I will now wait for boxed sets of Batman Beyond and Justice League. The latter two are also good series but not worth the near $40 going price for each season.

I'm among the majority of fans that prefer the artwork of the original three seasons of BTAS. I must say however that after having the fourth season set I have better appreciation for it. There could be logical explanations for the differences in character appearances. During one of the commentaries, somebody rationalized that in the intervening years between the Fox and WB shows, Commissioner Gordon had prostate cancer and that is why he is much thinner in the latter series. You could also say that Poison Ivy's skin was bleached by one of her toxins, Killer Croc was exposed to chemical pollutants that altered his appearance, etc.

If you are a fan of BTAS, this new low price makes it easy to own the whole set in one buy.",1224806400,,1497,4.557620817843866
3520184,4,B001CTXUTQ,"Batman: The Animated Series is the definitive animated Batman and probably the most consistently well-written version of Batman since the 1970s.  Way-better and truer to the traditional spirit of the character without being as maudlin and sadomasochistic as the typical Frank Miller-spawned story, and definitely a better way to introduce kids to the character and remind fans of what made the character stand out.
Now, if you own the series already in its original 4-box release or the Columbia House individual disc releases, there's probably not enough reason for you to rebuy it through this set.  On other hand, if you've never gotten the show because you were waiting for a ""complete"" collection, then this is probably the way to get the show.
The new extras sound decent enough but it's really the existing material that makes the show worth getting.  Unless you're an ultra-anal completist, I see no legitimate reason to buy the show again...",1222128000,25,950,5.076923076923077
8289300,4,B001CTXUTQ,"This was a fairly entertaining series which was obviously modeled after the Tim Burton era-art deco/brooding Batman. It came on when I arrived home from school. BUT, the themes addressed were not for children.

Detective Harvey Bullock is the foil here. He is an employee of gotham PD. BUT he does not particularly trust Batman or his motives  He only grudgingly comes to accept the Dark Knight after his own life is saved.

A real strength of this series is that it had multi-part episodes and story arcs. It presumed that kids were intelligent enough to follow along. This cartoon was like a soap opera. You had to watch it from the very beginning to understand what was going on.  They also got some big names to contribute to this project like Michael Gross, and Adam West (the 1960's Batman himself!)

You're going to recognize the bat mobile having also been tampered with by the Penguin in ""Batman Returns"". Here it is featured in an episode called the Mechanic. Given the animation of the series, it was a perfect storyline.

There are only two seasons unfortunately. It seemed longer because of my youth and/or they did some episodes in two parters.  Not crazy about the price though. Even with the work put into this series, still seems a little high at this point.",1512604800,,1275,4.690582959641255

I checked all the common signs of a bootleg such as misspellings and low quality printing but the package looks fine so i cant say if I was scammed or not.",1476489600,,400,4.405405405405405
