1784233,5,B00006L97J,"We love the Cedarmont Kids videos.  The Silly Songs are a lot of fun.  I bought my first video at a second hand store.  My Grandchildren wore it out, so I got on Amazon and bought another one.  It has the many old silly songs that, we Grandparents, enjoyed as children.  Good clean fun.  The children on the video are obviously having a lot of fun.  It is one of our very favorite videos.",1168560000,6,388,4.162162162162162

1784236,5,B00006L97J,My 3 year old daughter received this DVD as a baby and found it one day unopened. She listened to it all the te until she got it so scratched from thinking she could hold on to the DVD itself and carry it around and therefor it skipped all the time. We purchased a new one for her from Amazon. It came on time and it was her favorite Christmas present. She has all the kids at daycare very into it also!,1421020800,4,403,3.926829268292683
