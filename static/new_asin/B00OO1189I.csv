8684358,5,B00OO1189I,"An unromanticized, authentic portrayal of how life must have been back then. That said, I found the love story in this movie very believable and touching since they keep it true to its place and time, no schmaltzy dialogue just a man and woman helping each other survive. The best movie I have seen in many years.",1508284800,,313,4.508771929824562

8684362,4,B00OO1189I,"For all the acclaimed beauty of this film, it remains realistically harsh about the life of a young woman who is at first raped by the man of another tribe whom she eventually ends up loving. At one point in the film, she is punished for claiming the right to determine the use of her own sexual body. Her own tribe mistreats her for being a strong woman, e.g., a good hunter when only men should hunt. The film shows - and I do not know how historical this is - the xenophobia between two aboriginal cultures. Does this film re-present stereotypical narratives euro-Western society has laid on aboriginal culture? Or was the belittling of women and intertribal animosity present in the cultures of the First Peoples even before the arrival of Europeans? I do not know, and I find these stereotypes disturbing. I recommend seeing this film; yet do not watch with a nave perspective believing this is a fairytale love story.",1450483200,8,923,4.668711656441718
8684363,5,B00OO1189I,"Excellent! Beautifully filmed, true to historical detail; this film was worth every penny. I Purchased it to share with Native American youth, and it has everything: adventure, war, romance, language, ceremony, and gorgeous scenery. The fact that it was subtitled so that Native languages could be used was not even a distraction, it was so well done. Best subtitle effect ever used (IMHO) was when two tribes who didn't understand each other's language was ""translated."" You'll understand when you see it!",1446076800,14,506,5.2592592592592595
