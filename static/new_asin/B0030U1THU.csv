8386021,3,B0030U1THU,"I'm not an expert on women in prison movies, or anything for that matter, but I have seen a lot of WIP flicks, and I would not rate these high on my replay list, it's a great set in presentation, and has some good trailers and interviews, bonus features, but the films themselves Women in Fury, and Violence in a Women's Prison are both Italian directed and from the 70's and they somehow manage to take a lot of the fun out of the women in prison scenario, as with a lot of Italian films from this era they take themselves to seriously and the directors are trying to make dramatic ""high art"" not camp or even titillation really, especially in the case of Violence in a Womens Prison. Dead Riot is a newer straight to video flick that is right campy and fun.",1330214400,3,759,4.277777777777778
8386022,4,B0030U1THU,"The MediaBlasters DVD crew have provided another nice combo pack with this collection of 'women in prison' flix - presenting 3 movies for the price of one. I initially found this set while looking for the film 'Women In Fury' that another reviewer had cited as ""the best WIP film"" he'd ever seen - so I had to check it out! Having watched it, I'd have to admit it WAS pretty good (maybe not THE best ever) but it certainly did have 'all the elements' that one looks for in the WIP genre... lotsa naked cuties in sexploitationally abusive situations. Filmed in Brazil, the plot revolves around the incarceration of a lovely young socialite who 'takes the rap' for her brother in the murder of drug lord (or something) and ends up thrown into a women's prison with a bunch of hardened female criminals. Once 'inside' she is subjected to the full range of WIP indignities but wins the respect of her fellow inmates through her stoicism. The prison's male 'doctor' takes her side and struggles to have her released but it is ultimately via a prison break that she escapes. ""Women In Fury"" displays a very attractive cast of 'inmates' (especially the lead actress!) and they spend much of the film naked doing all the nasty things that (guys like to fantasize) women would get up to in the slammer (I'd give this film about 4.5 stars!). The set also includes ""Violence In A Women's Prison"" which features the, ever lovely, Laura Gemser (star of many an ""Emmanuelle"" flik) as a reporter infiltrating & exposing the brutal conditions behind bars. Per usual, Ms Gemser bares all (along w/ her fellow inmates) and suffers many harrowing ordeals (especially a vicious rat swarming while in 'solitary'!) before she is finally vindicated in the last reel. This is not really one of the better WIP films out there - somehow it takes itself too seriously and loses some of the 'fun' and 'heat' in the process...I'd give it a 3 star rating. The third flik ""Shadow"" looks to be of a much more recent vintage - crystal clear/shot direct to video - it is an over the top, cross-genre, gross out tour d'force that features: 'supernatural', blaxploitation, martial arts, and zombie elements - ALL within the WIP framework! This one has to be seen to be believed as it offers everything from the requisite nude shower sequence to a 'nursing' demon baby biting off its' mother's nipple while legions of the undead stalk the prison halls and the AfroAmerican heroine of the piece kicks butt!. I'd rate it about 4 stars for sheer audacity. So, all in all, something to 'offend' just about everybody in this delirious 3 pack - definitely worth a look, if you like your women - 'in prison'.",1318809600,10,2664,4.670212765957447
