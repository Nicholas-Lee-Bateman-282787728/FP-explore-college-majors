7985987,1,B00008O2ZB,"Twice I've started to watch this movie, actually hoping to like it. No luck! Really, the only way to enjoy it is to have a group of friends with you who like to make snide comments about bad movies. The banter will be much more entertaining than the movie. Even then, I bet you won't last more than 25 minutes before everyone loses interest. The visual effects are terrible, the plot meanders, and the whole thing is just plain boring. Check out David Heavener's Web site and you'll realize that this guy is pretty good at self-promotion, but I'm afraid he's not the most skilled filmmaker.",1270771200,2,590,4.5754716981132075
7985988,5,B00008O2ZB,"Don't be put off by the cheesy song during the opening titles. After this there are some shots of a spaceship that are highly reminiscent of the SFX used in the best Science Fiction ever (be it series or film): Blake's 7. Fans of that series know that expensive effects are not what a great viewing experience make, so for those of you who are only used to the boring Holywood films that only attract viewers because of the expensive FX, just sit through this scene for a very short while and you will be pleasantly surprised by what Outlaw Prophet has to offer. On first glance it doesn't show for the casual viewer, but look a little further and the film is a complicated amalgam of Science Fiction, an highly original view on religion and a very accurate attack on today's viewer-ratings-based television culture (if you can still call it that). And all of these elements are intertwined in a way that leaves you increasingly surprised as the film nears the end. The acting is very good, especially considdering the budget of the film - the little girl is briljant! David Heavener wrote, produced and stars in this film, so we know that what we see is actually the vision of the creator and no executives have messed with the product to include any ""popular themes"" or rip-off scenes from movies that sold well recently, as is so often the case with the expensive garbage that we see in the multiplexes. Highly recommended!!",1096243200,,1427,4.622047244094488

I actually had the opportunity of meeting David Heavener and asking him about the movie.  This was before I had seen the movie, though.  He told me that the movie was intentionally made cheesy to give it that B-movie feel.  And this wasn't his first film but it was the first film he entirely financed by himself.  So, that somewhat explains why it was so low-quality.

In closing:

This movie had a loose plot and poor dialogue.  But from what I've heard from David Heavener, it was made to be a really ""bad"" Sci-Fi movie.  It takes a lot of stereotypes & cliches commonly found in most Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies.  Not to mention, that he payed for this entire movie out-of-pocket.  To my knowledge, and I could be wrong, this was also the first ""christian"" movie he had ever produced/directed & acted in.  As for the music video, I agree that it could've been done a lot better.  But Heavener does have a good voice and for the style of music he plays (ie. INSP rock) it's fairly decent.

Overall, it's fun(ny) to watch but I unless you're a hardcore fan of ultralow-budget ridiculously corny Sci-Fi films, like I am, I would only rent this movie.

Trivia:

The scene where John141(Heavener) stumbles upon what appears to be a church BBQ was actually the first shot scene of the movie.  And it was completely improvised.  He bought the costume at a costume store & none of the people that he interacts with in this scene are actors.",1093219200,6,1464,4.565384615384615
