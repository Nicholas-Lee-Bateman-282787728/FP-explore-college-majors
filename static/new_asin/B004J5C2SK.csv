2. A Nissan 350Z is capable of a 3.5 second 0-60 time stock.
3. Your goal in a drift car is to hit 152mph before initiating drift.
4. It's optimal to have your GF and mom strip at the same club - carpooling!
5. Ignore the fact that your girl mechanic is hott as f... and instead keep dating the skanky stripper. Why? See #4.

I'm a Nissan guy, so liked seeing the Z and the GT-R featured. Other cars in the film were nicely modified. It's cool, if you like tunerz. Car racing action was good for a B-movie knock-off. Yeah, there was some cheesy CI, but that's to be expected from the Asylum. Storyline in these kinds of films are always predictable and it's Okay, it doesn't really take anything away from the action. Paul Logan in the film as ""the bad cop"" was quite excellent! Other no name actors were pretty decent as well. All in all a solid average effort.

8431669,4,B004J5C2SK,"It was a good movie for a Fast and Furious knock off. Some of the graphics look real, and others you can tell are animation. Kind of like when you played video games at a young age, and you can tell the cars aren't real, cause they have a strange color to them, but that was only at a couple parts. Also the Nissan rolled a few times, yet they where able to restore it, which is definately fake. I know its a movie, but doesn't come close to how real fast and furious looks. Also when he got pulled over by the police he just got his body slammed against the police car a few times, and let go without a fine or jail time for doing 160mph.

I would've given this movie 5 stars if the cars looked more realistic. I mean they looked realistic till they crashed, then you could tell when they where about to crash that they where animated.",1350777600,,836,4.097560975609756

8431671,1,B004J5C2SK,"I went into this with an open mind. I thought it was a ""Fast and Furious"" rip-off and it was.
How many of these do we need? It looked like every camera angle was taken directly from F&F.

It has a lot of holes, when the kid cares for the bad guy after he raced and his brother died and then another wreck puts he and his girlfriend in the hospital... What's up with that?

The direction was text book and the director obviously doesn't know how to direct actors. Like I stated before, they just mimicked shots from the original FF. The characters are even similar and they don't stay in character all the time.

It felt like it took forever to be over...

The CGI is terrible! Do they think the audience doesn't notice or care, ""Some of us do"". I would rather see good practical effects, any day. Whatever happened to directors taking chances and doing something with a personal twist, as well?

I tried guys, I really did.

The best thing about this whole movie is the little Latina actress that plays the mechanic in it!",1306540800,2,1022,4.352631578947369
8431672,3,B004J5C2SK,"Starring: Paul Logan & Janet T. Keijser.
Directed by: Cole McKay.
Pretty amazing effort at trying to steal the thunder of Fast Five.
There was an actual story here about a man and his brother,Then the girlfriend and the mom have a journey to tell.
The cars are realistic to having the power to race around downtown Burbank.
Seems CGI is used for some of the trickier scenes,Like car crashes ,Etc...
Paul Logan is playing a Bad Cop in this film and although believable as evil,Not something we want to see again.
Janet Keijser adds to some unique scenes,When she plays the heroes mom as a stripper and hero has a girlfriend working at the same strippers club,Ummm... Ewwww !
Director is Cole McKay a stuntman's legend and possible shows what stunts are accomplished on a budget.",1306368000,2,777,4.678832116788321
