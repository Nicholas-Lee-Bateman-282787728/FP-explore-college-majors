7924324,1,B00004VY08,I thought it had something related to Hanuman but its far from that. The story is also very bland for my liking,1392681600,,111,4.090909090909091
7924325,4,B00004VY08,"If kids in North America could see this, I'm sure they'd be delighted with all of the leaps and antics made by the monkeys.  The editors were very clever in managing to narrate a story around them.  The scenery, among ancient ruins in the countryside of India, is as impressive as watching scenes from Baraka and as nourishing as scenes from The Gods Must Be Crazy.",1317686400,,365,4.515151515151516

Welcome to the 'Kingdom of Hanuman' the beloved Monkey-God of India! Beautifully filmed on location in India, this is an absolutely perfect film that will be loved by the whole family. There's something here for everyone, it's beautiful to watch, well paced and exciting at times, topped off with a touch of bittersweet romance. All this and lots of monkeys too! These elements are subtly interconnected by a thread of Hindu mysticism and spirituality which provides an added dimension of depth and maturity for the adult audience. Truly ""All Is One.""",1197417600,3,635,5.0476190476190474
7924327,5,B00004VY08,"My 9 year-old son and I first saw this in a small town in the south of France town while on holiday. Although it was in French, my son was mesmorized by the bitter-sweet story line, the beauty of India and ""how DO they train the monkey's to do that!"" The first viewing I spent most of the film translating but the multiple viewing after, he just sat and watched, smile unending. A must have for every family!!",1187481600,,409,4.256410256410256
