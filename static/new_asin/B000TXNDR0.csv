8452748,1,B000TXNDR0,"The movie looks as if it was made by some junior high students as a class project. The graphics were so bad, with many just being repeated. When they talked about Oprah gaining popularity in the U.S., a United States map appeared on the screen! And when her fame became global, they showed a world map. Different ladies played Oprah doing an interview and looking at herself in the mirror, and those clips were repeated numerous times. For crying out loud, they talked about her background in television and showed a pair of earphones!!! Some of the people interviwed were a ""celebrity historian"" (who didn't even sound sure of her facts) and some ""Oprah enthusiasts"". How could this awful video ever be marketed?!",1313712000,5,714,4.813008130081301
