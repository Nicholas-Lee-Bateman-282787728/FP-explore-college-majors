7989448,5,B000094Q3J,I really enjoyed seeing some of the great comedians on this DVD...this DVD is not a complete show of all the comedians but it's shows some of the best segments of their shows...very funny.,1185580800,,188,4.5588235294117645
7989449,4,B000094Q3J,"Now this was fun! True, this is older stuff from the late 80's and early 90's but a lot of the material still makes me laugh. It interesting to see them when they were early in their career. The funnest were Carrot Top, Jim Carrey, Drew Carey and Tim Allen. Weakest was Norm Macdonald, 1st performance by Adam Sandler, Richard Lewis and Richard Belzer. Good thing Belzer plays a cop on Law and Order because he sucks as a comic.",1154736000,7,428,4.3625
7989450,2,B000094Q3J,"If you pan a comedy DVD because you ""never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer"", well...maybe the problem isn't the product. If you know comedy, you'll know these names. If you think the comedy spectrum runs from Carrot Top to Jeff Foxworthy, well...enjoy that vanilla ice cream.

That said, you're getting what you pay for here - a machine gun riff through early material (the photos on the cover are a tipoff) by people who for the most part do better work elsewhere. Consider it a museum piece; a Time-Life collection of clips assembled for convenience. For completists; the curious might want to wait for a cheap used copy.",1149120000,15,650,4.803571428571429
7989451,3,B000094Q3J,"Chris Rock isn't very funny, and I've never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer, so they weren't too great. Ellen Degeneres was funny, though, because she talked about how things always are on airplanes. That was funny. Rosie O'donnell was funny too. I think this dvd was about the comedy  before these comedians became who they are today. It becomes manageable by including: Carrot Top, Cheech Marin, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Jason Alexander, Jeff Foxworthy, 2 performances by Adam Sandler, Janeane Garofalo, Ray Ramano, Drew Carey, Jerry Seinfeld and Kelsey Grammer. 3 and a half stars.",1121212800,5,609,5.151515151515151
7989452,4,B000094Q3J,"After reading the other reviews I have to say true, it must have been taped in the early 90s, BUT excellent comedy never grows old. Jeanine Garaffalo is hysterical with her dysfunctional family deadpanning; Jim Carrey does an excellent imitation of both Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones (his hips Never stop gyrating); Tim Allen in his pre-sitcom days perfecting his now classic grunting like an ape (pig?); Seinfeld's rarely seen Jason Alexander; Jeff Foxworthy drawing his Southern comparisons, and on and on. It's completely worth seeing if only to gasp at how different these comedians look today: Richard Lewis was a true Hottie and Chris Rock and Ellen DeGeneres must have been in high school. I'd give it three and a half stars because the hour and some odd minutes took me by surprise a couple of times with my laughing out loud but I'll round it up to four stars because I was able to watch without having to wade through cursing and crude racial comparisons -- always a banner day.",1092355200,12,988,4.716763005780347
