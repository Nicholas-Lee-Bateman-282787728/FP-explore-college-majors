4830937,5,B005LZQKBW,My son really enjoyed seeing and learning about this wonderful country. The video was full of color and gave a view on many aspects of Ecuadorian life in a manner accessible to children. Having a child narrator seemed to help as well.,1317600000,,234,4.595238095238095

4830939,5,B005LZQKBW,I watched both documentaries by this film maker (on Ecuador and Cuba) and appreciate that they narrate the video using children as speakers.

4830942,5,B005LZQKBW,"My niece and nephew love the Worlds Together DVD's and this one is no exception; it captured their attention, at 5 and 7. -  They move to its music as they watch, and the original music written by Elmer Hawkes sets the tone for a visit to a country that is pretty remarkable.  But it's the young people they get to see that seems to capture their imagination as they watch.  Elmer's DVDs are the DVD's I love to share with them, and we've watched them together. Elmer's series of DVD's have been brought to our high school in NH by the PTSA for a film seminar class, music class, and World Studies, World Lit class!  Elmer catches things that catches their imagination and they loved talking with him after the DVD's,as he shared some of his experience of travel with them.",1354233600,2,773,4.422535211267606

8478806,4,B005LZQKBW,"A documentary narrated by a kid, and it is a very educational view of Ethiopia. Shows a positive and realistic view of what it is like to live in Ethiopia, from a child's perspective. Teaches history, culture, geography and the diversity of the people living there. Shows the poverty, but also shows the beauty. Children can learn about other children that live in this far away place. Educational from beginning to end. I like how you see the characters at work and at play, they are working together and look happy. A child can see how their culture is different, but also the similarities, to their own.

Here's what our kids had to say: ""Shows us how it is to really live in Ethiopia."" ""It is interesting."" They like how the kids in the film look happy and are playing. ""I like learning about geography."" ""I like to learn about different cultures."" Even though it was purely educational, they show interest all the way through. ""I like the music in the background."" ""It is cool that it is narrated by a boy."" ""I like that it is a real documentary and shows how people dress and work."" ""I didn't know that Ethiopia had grass because TV never shows that part. I like seeing a better view of it."" Before the film some of the kids said they thought Ethiopia was just ""poor and sad because they don't live like we do in the US."" After, they were interested in learning more about other countries. ""It wasn't how I had pictured Ethiopia in my mind."" Kids are stimulated to discussion after viewing and verbally express learning a lot from the film, from history to geography to how people live in Ethiopia.",1355875200,2,1604,4.531034482758621
8478807,5,B005LZQKBW,It provided great insight into a land and culture that otherwise seems so distant.  It allows the viewer to gain valuable insight on another culture that otherwise would not be possible.,1355097600,,186,5.0
8478808,5,B005LZQKBW,"I've shared this DVD with my family, and my 5- and 7-year old niece and nephew joined us to watch it.  They were so captivated by seeing the kids in each West African country Elmer visited, and the window to the many facets of the culture captured on the DVD held my niece and nephew's attention, as they moved to the music while they watched.  Elmer writes much of the music on the DVD and produces it with his friends.  Very accessible and it reflects his appreciation for the people of countries he traveled in!  It may be made for a wider and older audience, than these little ones, but even they enjoyed it...
  The high school I worked in had the great honor of a visit from this filmmaker, Elmer Hawkes, and the film seminar, music, and World Studies, World Lit students loved his DVD's as well.  Their questions for Elmer reflected their engagement and he shared some of his travel experiences with them.  The window of his world has opened mine...",1355011200,,956,4.485549132947977
