8362327,5,B00000K3VN,"This video is very important for any martial artist who wants to improve their abilities by MAGNITUDES.  It shows how to use the body as a flexible, explosive and powerful weapon - by being relaxed.  The concept of internal  energy through relaxation is brought into grappling, kicking and punching.  You are shown how to practice it, how to generate the energy and you even  see full contact kickboxing.  It is shown in slow motion so you can catch  how the students' bodies shake in response to being kicked and punched.  All I can say is I'm glad I'm not on the receiving end!  I would say, this  tape sure shows you how you need to relax while sparring.  Lots of great  tips.",962755200,,679,4.475409836065574
8362328,5,B00000K3VN,"This video is for those interested in applying principles of internal energy to the martial arts.  It begins by teaching simple methods of developing ""chi"" and then shows how to neutralize the opponent's  force using your body in a springy, resilient way.  Other topics include  grappling, penetrating the opponent's defenses, kicking and punching,  including full contact sparring shown in slow motion.  The purpose is not  to teach you how to fight (for that see ""Chinese Kickboxing"" or  ""Practical Self Defense"") but how to approach your self defense  from the viewpoint of internal energy.",955843200,,593,5.290322580645161
