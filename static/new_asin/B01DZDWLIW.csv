8757389,3,B01DZDWLIW,"Anime is great... at least what I can watch. I would give five stars for the anime; however,  the disc starts and stops at places.  Perhaps, flaws in the disk... Bummer!",1487635200,,169,4.419354838709677
8757390,4,B01DZDWLIW,"Great series, one I cannot recommend enough, but I bought off ""new or used,"" so I have run into one glaring flaw. I don't know if this let down is particular to copies from Thailand (where my copy came from), but the opening and closing credits don't come with english subtitles. This is a real shame, as when I watched the episodes originally on Crunchyroll, the intro and ending themes had english subtitles, and the lyrics to both those songs added more emotional content to the show. If the intro and ending theme songs include english subtitles on copies bought in the US, I will look to replace my copy with a newer, American version, and promptly give the series five stars. But if this oversight is indicative of all copies with english subtitles, then I must rate local copies with four stars.",1476230400,,802,4.615384615384615
