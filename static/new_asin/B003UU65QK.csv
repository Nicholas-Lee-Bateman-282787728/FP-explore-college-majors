4207393,5,B003UU65QK,"I occasionally come here to review movies, i especially come here when i think a movie is really bad and horrible, or if a movie is pretty good and terrific.
this time, im here because of the latter as this movie really entertained me, it was bloody intense and kept me on edge of my seat, was fast paced and thrilling.
I won't go through the plot in detail, as it has been discussed here, its basically a story about a thief who breaks into a house to steal Jewellery, only to find himself trapped in the house with evil.
I must say, this movie should not be missed, highly recommended.",1266796800,,587,4.297297297297297
4207394,4,B003UU65QK,"The Collector is a classic example of what a horror/suspense movie should be. This movie is much more than your typical slasher flick. The Collector is not necessarily scary but it will keep you very tense.
Take you typical cat burglar, now give him expert craftiness at setting sadistic traps and a cold, ruthless lust for blood and you have your antagonist. He never even whispers a word but emits animalistic sounds of rage and pain that would loose the bowls of the most stout-hearted man. However, I did wonder how he had the time to set up all his elaborate traps.
The backstory is weak and there are a few arbitrary characters but the core of the story is solid.
After watching this movie don't be surprised if you find yourself double and triple-checking your home security system every evening!
Every horror fan will enjoy The Collector.",1266624000,,846,4.722972972972973

4207396,5,B003UU65QK,"I don't know what some of these people are talking about, but this movie is AWESOME.  I have to admit, I didn't think it was going to be this much Gore in the movie.  I haven't been this creeped out in a Horror movie like this in a long time.  I just don't understand why there were so many traps in the house.  If anyone is familiar with the Video Game ""Deception"" you will think this would have made a perfect movie.  I really don't like much gore like how some of the Saw movies started off, but I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  The only thing I want to know is if this guy is Human??  I wanted to see his face so bad.  If there is a sequel, I'm sure they will go into some of the backstory of who the guy is, but if your ready for a good horror movie, This one is worth a watch.",1266019200,31,795,3.775757575757576
4207397,2,B003UU65QK,"Name-dropping is an extremely common tactic in cinema, and much to the chagrin of movie fans who would just as soon save twenty bucks, it usually works.  I suppose it would be difficult to not name-drop in some regard; how else, with the multitudes of movies many every year, would a film with no extremely well-known actors and actresses get any publicity at all?  The pushers of The Collector therefore chose to highlight two individuals involved with Saw IV, V, and VI fame, no doubt hoping that Saw franchise followers, of which there are throngs, would see The Collector and make it an overnight hit.  And me?  Of fulfilling the name-dropping purpose, I am 100% guilty, but unfortunately, would just as soon have saved twenty bucks.
 The opening of the film appears promising:  a man and a woman return home to find their power off, and discover a strange box in their bedroom that moves menacingly.  The ending of that scene, coupled with the imagery accompanying the electronic/industrial opening soundtrack, does in fact remind of Saw, but that's where the good similarities end.
 The Collector's central actor Josh Stewart, who looks as if he could be Sean Penn's younger brother, plays Arkin, a longtime handyman for a rich family.  Arkin's ex-wife has apparently accrued a sum of debt with loan sharks, and is relying upon Arkin to get her enough money to appease them.  Arkin, utilizing his ties with associates he met while in prison, enters an agreement with said associates whereby he will rob his employer in order to get money by midnight of the day in question.  As it turns out, his employer, played by Michael Reilly Burke (of the titular role in indie flick Ted Bundy), is a jewel broker, and has a safe hidden in his bedroom that contains a very large gem.  We also get glimpses into the lives of Burke's screen wife and two daughters, one a teen, and one much younger.  So far, so good - a story not that much out of the ordinary, and an intriguing movie intro that implies Arkin will run into similar happenstance.
 This is the point at which the movie's plot starts to unravel.  After determining that the family would be gone on vacation, Arkin enters the home to burglarize it.  Right away he is met with danger, as he hears another person enter.  During Arkin's evasion of this other figure, he finds that not only is the family still at home, but they are being held and tortured, and the house is filled with traps (razor wire, acid, knives, and the like).  Arkin chooses not to rob the family, but instead, attempts to save their lives from this malevolent invader.  Okay, I'll buy it, but the rest had better be good.
 Unfortunately, cliched scenes follow, especially akin to the Saw franchise and Hostel.  Blood?  Check.  Gore?  Check.  Nudity?  Check.  But the main problem?  None of the scenes are as inventive, scary, or gruesome as the aforementioned, a fact which would be redeemable with a thrilling story.  Throughout the course of the film from the above point on, I was entertained, but only just enough to not be bored.  And when The Collector came to a close, I couldn't help but think: that's it?  Simply put, save your twenty bucks and your next hour-and-a-half.  The Collector, though an interesting idea, fails to match its own ambition, and should only be seen by those desperate for gore before the next Saw entry.",1257120000,3,3364,4.707191780821918
4207398,4,B003UU65QK,"This movie is basically like other review's said it's Home Alone for Saw fans,And it was intended to be a Saw prequel called the Midnight Man

The movie is a about a homebulder and convict and thief named Arkin who breaks into a house he is working for while his boss and family are away,but someone else is already in there.

This movie i thought brought something new to the Horror Movie Table. Every good Horror Movie has a good killer,and i think the collector was an excillent murderer

The Collector looks like a thief with a ski mask that you tie in the back,and his traps are very brutal,and he is silent but makes strange noises.

The story with thief vs serial killer was amazing and was done good

4207400,3,B003UU65QK,"I caught this one in theaters back in late July, but it wasn't listed yet to review, so here is my quick review...

The Collector is like a combination of the SAW films, Hostel and a little something all it's own. I liked how the ""bad guy"" who plans on robbing the house ends up being just another victim of the S&M masked killer (who is already in the house tormenting a family) and ends up being the film's hero. The acting is only average and it really isn't that scary, but the crude traps filled throughout the house, while not on a SAW level, are pretty neat. The killer himself is unique and quite creepy, but don't expect a new horror icon to emerge here. It's also filmed very dark with some grain at times. Not Grindhouse level, but it has a raw look to it that is probably intentional.

2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (for a decent premise, killer and a couple of good deaths)",1253145600,,881,4.207100591715976
4207401,3,B003UU65QK,"Imagine if the madman from Saw watched Home Alone as inspiration for his next master plan of senseless killing.  Bear-traps, trip-wires, a house where every corner presents a mortal danger, I wouldn't open that cookie jar if I were you.  How to get out?  How to survive the kitchen and the foyer?  How to navigate the dangers of a house when torture traps are set up everywhere and a masked psycho with glowing eyes is slashing and cutting with razor sharp knives?

The actual killer, the character himself, is slow, deliberate, and evil.  Without a word spoken, the guttural tortuous sounds and taunting whispers are pure sadism, and a means to a deadly, horrendous end.  He's vulnerable, realistic, and a very well done, albeit underdeveloped character.

On the other hand, the setup, story, and character development is fairly nonexistent; and that's the problem.  No real reasoning is given for the pointless murders, other than the killer lives up to the movie's namesake: He's a collector.  In that respect, the movie is quite disappointing.  Meanwhile, the protagonist - if you can call him that - is Arkin (Josh Stewart), a repairman who takes jobs at large houses just so he can rob them later.  There is back story with his wife and a loan shark, but it's completely irrelevant to the moral dilemma he faces, whether it's fortune and flight, or a possibly fatal fight.  I'm not really sure why it was included, and the movie would have been better suited to have one more relative - perhaps an alcoholic uncle staying on vacation - to eviscerate in a ridiculously contrived manner.  Story and character development is simply non-existent or unimportant to the filmmaker's purposes.  It's essentially the Panic Room without either the panic or moral obligation - not to mention superior acting - of Forest Whitaker.

The pace and tension, however, is very well done.  Dark, creative kills, realistic blood and gore, a wonderfully done disembowelment, and enough torture-porn to appease even the most ardent horror buff, but not the most keen cinema fan.

Go to quicken your pace, to arrest your heartbeat, and to rip your fragile home-owner securities to shreds.  Recommended for the non-pretentious movie fan or horror aficionado who wants a plotless, pulse-pounding smorgasbord of blood.",1252886400,37,2298,5.015831134564643
4207402,2,B003UU65QK,"""The Collector"" is an exercise in futility, a film that takes the time to develop a plot that's rendered useless by the end. The fact that there was a plot to begin with was pointless; this is above all a torture flick, and so far as I can tell, the audiences these kinds of movies attract are not interested in character development, plausibility, conflict, emotion, pacing, dialogue, and resolution. They just want blood and cringe-inducing shots of sharp object penetrating the skin. If you want to make that kind of movie, fine, but don't bother trying to give it context. Just go for the jugular, figuratively and literally. At least then you'll have a film with conviction. ""The Collector"" goes wrong by wanting to be both a gritty gore fest and a character-driven story with a moral to it. In my opinion, that's a contradiction in terms.

I guess I shouldn't have expected anything more, seeing as it was written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, who also wrote the fourth, fifth, and sixth installments of the equally torturous ""Saw"" series. Did they take inspiration from a 1965 film also titled ""The Collector,"" which tells the story of a lonely young man who kidnaps a woman and keeps her just because it makes him happy? Maybe so, even though it was never advertised as a remake; the 2009 film tells the story of a man who targets families and kidnaps certain people and keeps them locked in a trunk. There's also the fact that the 1965 film prominently features butterflies while the 2009 film occasionally features various kinds of bugs, including roaches, wasps, and spiders. But I'm looking too deeply into this. The people behind 2009's ""The Collector"" don't stop to consider such details.

The completely unnecessary back story focuses on Arkin (Josh Stewart), a repairman who plans to rob the home of a rich jewel broker so that his wife can pay off a loan shark. The wife's problem: She needs the money by tonight. Arkin promises he can get it to her by midnight and goes back to his clients' home, believing they've gone out of town. The home is a sprawling southern-style mansion that, of course, is in the middle of nowhere (Southern Californians will be quick to notice that the front looks similar to Disneyland's Haunted Mansion). Upon entering, Arkin discovers that virtually every room is rigged with an elaborate series of booby traps, all attached to a system of wires stretched from wall to wall. Worse still, a masked man who never speaks roams the house, and he already has the husband and wife (Michael Reilly Burke and Andrea Roth) bound and bloodied up down in the basement. The younger daughter (Karley Scott Collins) is missing. Only the older daughter (Madeline Zima) seems to have gotten away.

Now Arkin is faced with a dilemma: Does he rob the house and leave, or does he stay and try to save the family? Had the film not been so insistent with lingering shots of hooks, knives, and various other metal tips painfully piercing someone's flesh, I might have actually cared. But for this movie, that's impossible--there's no conceivable way for us to care when blood and torture are being shoved into our faces. And yet they keep trying. One of the motivating factors for Arkin is the missing younger daughter, whose name is Hannah; apparently, she reminds him of his own daughter, Cindy (Haley Pullos). Why take the time to create these characters at all? Why include an emotional subplot? The end of the film goes for typical horror movie overkill, and that only achieves shock value, not a genuine emotional payoff. At that point in the film, both Hannah and Cindy are conveniently forgotten.

So is the story, which brings me back to my original complaint: ""The Collector"" is a film that's not ambitious enough to be a straight-up torture flick. It tries to even things out with a plot, only to eventually realize that it never needed one. I'm usually the first to criticize a film for putting style over substance, but in the case of torture flicks, style is really all they have to fall back on. A plotless succession of gore and physical pain could never be considered entertainment, but at least it could be said that it delivered exactly what it promised. When you include a story that tries to make a point, you're aiming too high.

Such is the failure of ""The Collector,"" a brutal, blood-soaked horror tale that can't decide what it wants it be. Had it been true to itself, the fact that the titular character is a complete mystery wouldn't be a problem. But because the filmmakers went for a story, we find ourselves completely at a loss to account for the Collector, least of all his ability to rig an entire house with booby traps. What's the deal with the room with acidic glue poured all over the floor? And why did that scene require the gruesome death of a cat? Is it now a rule that any horror film featuring an animal must have a scene of it dying? But I'm rambling. The real problem this film suffers from is a lack of conviction. If you want to make a torture flick, make a torture flick--don't put any effort into a story that ultimately no one will care about.",1250208000,4,5128,4.674418604651163

I remember seeing the trailer for this movie, and waiting to see it at the theater, but it never got screened, at least nationwide (limited possibly).

I'm assuming they were supposed to tie-in with each other in some mini-Saw-Collector universe.  True or not, it would only have added the appeal to this movie.  In my opinion this movie stands on its own, and does not need to tie itself to the SAW franchise.  The anti-hero taking on the villain in this movie in a cat-and-mouse game really appealed to me, and the traps are ridiculously heinous.  The sequel was enjoyable, but does not compare to the tension in this first episode.  I only wish I could have seen this on the big screen.

If you liked the Saw franchise, this film is directed/written by Marcus Dunstan with the aid of Patrick Melton two of the people who worked on the Saw franchise. When a engineering genius who also happens to be a sociopathic killer you are in for an interesting ride. When a young woman is kidnapped the only man to ever escape is compelled by her rich father and his 'hit' squad to go back into the house to save her. Which isn't easy when you are in a huge maze like complex full of mechanical death traps and people who have been driven mad by what the sociopath has done to them.",1436486400,,640,4.341666666666667

It's not just being trapped in room with some torture contraption strapped to your head. It's being stuck in a house with the most twisted booby traps and a horrorifying psycho stalking you. Which I think is great. It puts a new twist on the slasher and is truly scary. I watch a lot of horror and I usually don't get scared but there were points in this movie that I actually was scared.

I am a big fan of the slasher subgenre of horror and this was spot on. I miss when they used to make movies with these great horror icons: Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees. Now it's all about ghosts and hauntings, which I do enjoy some of them, but I wish they made more movies like this. It's a shame that this movie nor it's sequel have a huge following. I think the collector could be a modern face in horror but, sadly, paranormal movies are cheaper to make and people keep buying tickets so this will most likely remain a cult classic.

All of these poor tricks are amply used to artificially drag out the weak story and mediocre suspense.

Do you think someone wandering into a room with hundreds of fishing hooks dangling from the ceiling is either cool or scary? Do you mind if someone hits a person who has tried to repeatedly murder them over the head with a gun instead of shooting them with it? If you answered yes and no respectively, you might enjoy this movie. I'm very good with the suspension of disbelief, but this film had far too many moments where you leap off the couch screaming, ""Why would they do that when they could do this?"" After all, the magical premise of the film is that a house is invaded by both an insane serial killer AND a cat burglar on the same night.

There are a few decent cat-and-mouse scares in the beginning as characters silently pursue each other, but otherwise the film has stupefying turns with a plethora of gore and suffering.",1411344000,,1114,4.737113402061856

4207522,5,B003UU65QK,"Question one: Can there be ""good"" torture porn?
Answer: a qualified ""yes"", if you mean: artfully done. Masterfully accomplished.
I'll defend this at some other point, but right here I'll just add that I think gore hounds and scream queens and body melt fans and all the quibbling critics in the horror world should just band together and say that when David Edelstein coined the term ""torture porn"" he hit the nail right on the head. It is a freaking awesome name for a really twisted sub genre that only a few can handle, and that's how it should be.
Which brings me to the Collector, who is not only a seminal figure in Torture Porn, but also the second scariest on screen serial killer I have seen...
I used to doubt my judgment on that. I would say: but the guy's no Hannibal Lecter, right? And Lecter won the Oscar, which means he's the quality king, mother approved, case closed. Right?
Absolutely not.
Remember when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/B001KT6JPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>&nbsp;came out and all sorts of exposition and background stuff about Hannibal Lector came to the foreground and the dude just went from scary to frankly goofy.
Well get this: Nobody ever, not once, gives us a hint at what is driving the Collector.
Well, surely a smart analyst would start piecing apart the things that the Collector says to, say, his victims. Or the cops who are pursuing him.
But dig this. The Collector never speaks. Not here at least. Not word one. All you have are his torture porn misdeeds, which are graphic and in your face and reprehensible...
And the way the man flipping MOVES.
Two words for you: Juan Fernndez. Can I hear some love? The man has a touch of Chaplin. He has a touch of  Mikhail Baryshnikov. He is absolutely perfect.
So yes, you will see some stuff that is absolutely obscene and which you might never forget...but I'm guessing if you're reading this review, this is maybe not an issue for you.

That should be enough of a clue to determine that this is a very gory film and filled with the same devious and wince worthy traps.

The film is centered around a serial killer called the collector, he kills groups of people at a time but kidnaps one of them, but no-one knows why. The film opens in a night club where he has positioned some nasty traps that rack up the kill count quite rapidly. Amidst the chaos one of the previous victims escapes and another one taken.

A team of mercenaries has been hired to rescue the girl and the escapee has rather handily memorised the location he was taken to. There the trap theme continues. I have to say that this isn't a good film, however it is reasonably entertaining. Yes it's very silly, but it does have some nice ideas woven into the gore.

Instead of putting out the fire by breaking the glass collection containers, the fire at the end would simply go out of control with alcohol from the glass collection containers and kill everyone at the end.

4207545,4,B003UU65QK,"This film was not what I thought it would be. It does have a low budget, or so it seems, however the claustrophobic nature of the film does not require extensive financial presence. The protagonist in an interesting character - he is jaded (which is cliched now), but he is also not really a good guy. He does what he needs to do to survive. Once he gets into his bosses house to rob the place, the film just goes crazy. The traps that have been set are seemingly impossible to escape. I enjoyed the fact that our hero gets injured a lot on the way, rather than somehow missing all the traps and escaping unscathed. I found this movie really interesting to watch - sort of like a Saw film, except not as gruesome (not to me anyway) - and the endings in these films usually disappoint, but The Collector really got it right. The ending was superb.

What let this movie down was that it failed to make itself unique in the sense that it was highly reminiscent of Saw. Now that The Collection has been released, this similarity grew even stronger, which prevents this film (and the sequel) from really growing into its own franchise.

Overall, this film does take you on one hell of a ride, if you don't enjoy horror, then basically don't watch it. If you do, then this film is for you.",1375401600,,1283,4.364016736401673

The ruthlessness was particularly brutal. Our villain was a sick, twisted, sadistic bada$$. The problem with the story was unfortunately me. I just cant help myself. I always tend to pick apart these kind of films. Like how did the killer find the time to set up all these traps? They were pretty elaborate and they were everywhere. Pretty good for what was supposedly a few hours. Also, I hate when they make the police complete morons. Another little annoyance was that the hero-type-guy ripped off the killer's mask and they didn't show the killers face. Ever! So why did they put that little clip in there. The real killer for me was that the movie was just too dark. I hate when you cant see all the action and effects. Would it kill the director to turn on just one light. Dark movies always peeve me.

Yes, this film is pretty inadequate. This torture nut wasn't a ""collector"" of humans; all he did was mutilate them to death. The plot is so paper thin, however, that having an execrable torture killer is rendered virtually meaningless. Well, he had some pretty insufferable special traps all over the house and tortures the family throughout the film.

The film is not scary, in fact it's laughable at points. If you ONLY want to see torture with zero atmosphere, suspense, or true scares then go for it.

I won't tell you because that would be a spoiler and I am massively anti-spoiler. The Collector is a film whose scare content is massively underrated probably because the storyline can be a bit confusing the first time you see it, but basically it is about a thief who burgles higher class properties when the occupants are away. It is classified R so don't expect the sex, maimings and disfigureings you get in those oh so horrid NR movies. You might also want more blood, and the body count doesnt even reach double figures. In its favour this RA Bluray shows off the excellent exteriors interiors and locations, and you can see every detail even in the darkest scenes. I always try to go to a theatre with a circle, sit somewhere in the middle, and really try to take these sort of films seriously.

This is why I refuse to buy a larger house, someone could have a whole family living there and not be detected. It was kind of funny that the guy that broke in the house, could not get out at first.

When I saw those booby traps, I knew this was not going to go well for him or me.  I'am thinking, oh boy, a Saw movie.  If a person likes gore and torture, then this movie's for you.  There are some really bad torture scenes.  The one with the roaches, the tooth, fish hooks, and bear traps was thrill kill/torture at the highest.

4207610,4,B003UU65QK,"It's completely unbelievable, but The Collector (2009) is still quite entertaining, if you are into twisted sadistic horror, and enjoy some mean and nasty kills, as a man bent on robbery, finds himself part of a deadly game, matching wits with a mysterious masked killer.  The film is co-written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, one of the more prolific horror writing teams currently around.  The pair's credits include the Feast series, Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, Saw 3D, and Piranha 3D.  Directed by Dunstan, The Collector has an atmosphere similar to a Saw film, where it requires that you suspend disbelief in order to go on a very dark journey that can be fun for some, but is not for everybody.

A man named Arkin (Josh Stewart) is one of several contractors working at the home of Michael Chase (Michael Reilly Burke), an affluent jewelry broker.  The Chase family includes wife Victoria (Andrea Roth), and daughters Jill (Madeline Zima), and youngster Hannah (Karley Scott Collins).  When Arkin's ex-wife (Daniella Alphonso) tells him that she needs cash in a hurry to pay off some loan sharks, Arkin decides to break into the Chase home, since they will be away on vacation.

On the way to the residence, Arkin narrowly avoids being mauled by a dog that is chained to a stake in the yard.  The presence of the dog at a home that is supposed to be empty, might serve as a clue that something may be amiss.  Entering the house Arkin is about to open the safe in the upstairs bedroom, when he discovers that he is not alone.  The Chase family never left, and are being held captive by a man wearing a mask who has clearly been abusing them.  A terrified Victoria asks Arkin to save her daughter Hannah, who she believes is hiding somewhere in the house.  In part because he also has a young daughter, Arkin attempts to save the family.

Like a Saw film, a number of elaborate and diabolical traps are featured.  Setup throughout the house, the traps are outrageously ridiculous, like something Wylie Coyote would have dreamed up to kill the Roadrunner.  The results are fascinating, when the traps are sprung.  A highlight is one where the victim is launched into a board with nails driven into it and impaled, with one eye slightly displaced by a nail passing through it. This touch shows attention to detail.  Another setup featuring a series of bear traps, is more crude and excessive.  In setting up the myriad of traps, The Collector apparently a lot of time on his hands.  What motivates him isn't clear, but what he apparently collects are people he finds of interest, who he stuffs into a small storage chest.

A pivotal moment occurs after Arkin has escaped from the house, and sees Hannah calling to him from an upstairs window, with The Collector's shadow visible in a downstairs window.  Arkin returns to the house, and things become very personal between The Collector and Arkin, as he attempts to get Hannah out alive.

This is a surrealistic journey, with little that stands up to any kind of examination.  Besides the unbelievable traps, the way Arkin is able to freely move through the house, without getting killed by the traps, or detected by The Collector, is pretty improbable.  The film's finish emphasizes the point that there are no logical limits on what can happen, and that safety really doesn't exist.  Like most of Dunstan's and Melton's projects, this one is edgy, and extremely violent.  More of a horror fantasy, plot development is weak, but for pure impact and execution, the film scores high marks.  If you are a fan of the Saw series, you may appreciate the deadly sense of peril and dark tone of The Collector.  It's not perfect, but earns a rating of four and a half stars, mainly because there isn't much more that could have been added to the story, which concludes outrageously, setting the stage for a follow up.  As of this date, the sequel titled `The Collection' is reportedly in post-production, with Josh Stewart returning as Arkin.",1309046400,2,3987,4.721098265895954

While the filmmakers dutifully put the characters through their painful sequences, the viewer is left to wonder why the killer has chosen this family, how he got them back into the house, how he rigged up a series of intricate traps in a few hours...and the list goes on.

4207614,4,B003UU65QK,"The Collector was written and directed by Marcus Dunstan as well as co-written by Patrick Melton. When I first heard that the writers of Saw 4-6 were making another horror film I was a bit weary. They never felt to me to be the strongest movies in the Saw franchise and I really wasn't able to get drawn into them but I will be the first to admit that I was wrong. I will happily admit to being wrong as well since when they are creating something new and not using someone eles's material Marcus and Patrick can put together something amazing.

The introduction to the film is pure character development without a hint of where the plot is going to go. We are introduced to Arkin (Josh Stewart) who at first appears to be a handyman helping restore a house. Its soon shown that this handy man is actually a thief who is casing the house looking for where a certain item is kept. He finally finds where the item is stored and soon finds out his wife owes a lot of money and has until midnight to pay. Knowing he is low on time he moves up to plotting the theft to that night though when he get's back to the house things are not as expected.

While breaking into the safe Arkin hears someone else moving in the house and attempts to avoid him. He soon though stumbles across Michael(Michael Reilly Burke), the father, who looks beaten and is violently dragged from the room. It is at this point that the movie truly takes off and keeps up a great mixture of both suspense and action until the very end.

Both Michael and his wife Victoria (Andrea Roth) are both being held captive by a mad man in a mask. Arkin quickly finds out that the entire house is set with traps and he must navigate through them to try both rescue the family and escape. While he attempts to rescue the parents he soon finds that both of their daughters Jill (Madeleine Zima) and Hannah (Karley Scott Collins) have not been caught by The Collector.

As Arkin tries to save the family he is constantly having to hide from The Collector who appears to ""collect"" people for his own unknown reasons. Every time he is able to make progress either he or the parents are injured and when escape looms near the daughters are brought into the film. I won't go into the end of the film as you'll want to see the twists for yourself but I will say it is a fun romp in horror, gore, and suspense.

Previously, as I said, I was completely iffy on the idea of Marcus and Patrick doing another horror film. After seeing what they can really do though I am hoping they keep making them! My only hope is that they learned from the Saw series so if they do create a franchise it doesn't end up the same way.",1301875200,2,2663,4.286282306163022

The film opens up slowly, after a quick splash scene right at the begining, and it took a while to get interesting, but when it did, it was a suspenseful mashup. The basic premise of a 'Collector' torturing people in a booby-trapped set-up was a great idea, and the atmostphere was oppressing for much of the film- that is, 'Get out of the House!'. A great twist on the horror idea, where you usually want to be INSIDE and safe from things. The dilema set up for the main character, a would-be thief who is constantly choosing between fight or flight was also a good horror element. A thief versus a psycho-killer, a cat-and-mouse game was a clever moral barometer for the audience and another great twist the film had going for it too- so two horror 'high-brow' concepts were included in the film that were effective and displayed in an inventive and creative way. Unfortunately little else in the film was done as well.

The major problem this film had going for it was sheer believability. Booby-trapping an entire house in the span of an afternoon? The size of the house, from the outside in comparison to the inside. The one sided hearing abilities of the protagonist versus the antagonist. The seeming omnipresence of the thief and his ability to not trigger any traps. The invulnerability of the 'Collector'. The 'Collector's' escape after getting hurt and being surrounded by cops...The list goes on. It's obvious the laws of reality weren't the least concern for the makers of the film, even though they tried hard to insert the feel, which they did effectively, of setting up a most horrible version of a home invasion.

After the plot hole problem, was the basic problem with character development and storyline- both completely absent. But again, the movie was designed simply to move you from killing scene to killing scene, make you tense, and show you gore- which it does. There are some great splatter-scenes, and the realism of the kill-scenes are top-notch. But ultimately, the film is too unbelievable to be more than a torture-feast, taking itself entirely too serious, but insulting the audience with it's shotgun sized story-holes. Too bad, because the thief-pscyho dynamic was a great idea, and the suspense was great through most of the film- until you started to actually think about what was going on and how unbelivable it was, and then you just got annoyed. In alot of ways, the title of the film, and how little it actually had to do with what happened in the film, other than being the opening and ending scenes, and it's single sprinkling in the rest of the movie sums up the gist of the film-""This is the movie you are watching, we aren't going to bother even thinking twice about what's going on, and you better not either, or the house will crumble."" Which it does. Completely.

So, pure, mindless, torture porn, yup.",1293321600,4,2869,4.768611670020121
4207621,2,B003UU65QK,"The Collector (Marcus Dunstan, 2009)

This will be a frustrating review to write, because almost everything that makes me rate the movie as low as I do can't be talked about without major spoilers. It could have been a fine, or at least a mediocre, little thriller; instead it comes off as a repository for all the traps they couldn't figure out how to shoehorn into the Saw movies (Dunstan and Melton have been responsible for that franchise since the fourth flick).

Plot: Arkin (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's Josh Stewart) is an ex-con who's trying to scrape up enough money to pay off his ex-wife's loan shark. He plots to rob the Chases, at whose house he was installing a security system earlier in the day. When he gets there, however, he discovers that he wasn't the only one casing the joint that day, and the other guy has a lot more than robbery on his mind. The house is turned into a criminal-vs.-criminal battlefield as Arkin tries to save young Hannah (The Hottie and the Nottie's Karley Scott Collins) from The Collector.

Yes, it's a generic thriller, but generic thrillers can be done well. Dunstan and Melton have taken a few good lessons away from their days with the Saw flicks, most notably the effective use of chiaroscuro; this isn't the murky, dark camerawork of most low-budget horrorfests. It's actually quite a well-shot film. I have no complaints with the technical aspects of the movie, and that's pretty rare.

Where it does go wrong is in the script, which Melton and Dunstan adapted from an earlier Dunstan story. Or so the credits tell us, but as I said, I think this was cribbed together from outtakes of Saw storyline meetings. ""Wouldn't a floor full of bear traps be cool? How about a chandelier with a bunch of knives tied to it?"" ""Yeah, but where would we put them in this movie?"" ""Oh, yeah, we'll save them for that non-Saw movie we've been talking about."" They threw in a few pieces of footage that will look very familiar to almost any horror fan who's been watching the past five years (the beginning of the movie is so reminiscent of the beginning of James Wan's Dead Silence that I had to check and see if Wan executive-produced the movie), and... here's where we get to spoiler territory. Let's just say nothing, but nothing, about this movie will even come close to surprising you. Disappointing you, yes, every ten minutes or so, but not surprising you.

I'm not a fan of the term ""torture porn"", especially when it's applied to movies where it doesn't belong, but I can kind of understand it here. This movie has no reason for existence other than its traps. Sultry Heroes beauty Madeline Zima, one of a surprisingly high number of cameos in the film, gets briefly topless, and there are a whole lot of loving close-ups of nasty things (including a graphic scene of animal torture, so avoid if you find that sort of thing objectionable). But it could have been so very, very much more than that. **",1290384000,,2955,4.620952380952381

Anyway, if you like your deaths exceptionally and creatively violent, the Collector is definitely for you.  I LOVE my horror films that fall under this category so I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  A terrific film.  I also strongly believe the Collector would make a perfect Halloween film.

The acting is probably what surprised me the most.  It's believably well done and, though obviously far-fetched given the nature of the storyline, the acting is totally fine regardless of that and without any faults whatsoever.  Solid job all around.

Alright, it's *entirely* true you have to understand that because of the unrealistic storyline, it's almost impossible for a robber to break into a home and put together a sequence of dangerous traps like the ones put together here.

I was curious while watching the movie- how exactly DID this psychotic robber think of such an elaborate and sophisticated plan, and do so with careful precision EVERY single time?  How did he find the time to set up each room with these carefully put together traps?  You'll be asking yourself the same questions, I guarantee it.

Some of the violence is gruesome to the point that your stomach will probably turn because it involves body parts being removed, such as teeth and intestines.  It's VERY gross, but... awesome too, lol.

4207624,1,B003UU65QK,"This was a long awaited movie by me - the trailer was great, the hype about the makers of 2 SAW films was encouraging - what a let down, from the minute the film started. The film quality was poor like a B movie, unfortunately the acting & script was only slightly better !

The story made very little sense if no sense - this guy ""the collector"" had to be some kind of superman to have converted a house from top to bottom with intricate traps & barriers in just a few hours. The main character could hear the slightest sound like a key in a lock and footsteps - but the Collector character seemed to be totally deaf, he couldn't hear the main character, walking, running around, slamming doors and drawers, talking loudly to other people & ripping and banging wood panels on the windows. The guy in the suitcase seemed to know exactly why he was in there - ""the bait"", for what and how did he know that ?? Considering there was traps all over the house, which from the outside was a big mansion - but inside seemed to be a three bedroom semi with a basement. Neither the main character or the Collector seemed to get caught up in the many traps - but all others did seem to fall prey.

I want to know who these people are on here that gave this rubbish more than 1 star (absolutely NOT scary / very predictable / same old tired scenario of the killer gets overpowered & knocked out, then the hero leaves him to attack another day / the Collector uses a dead guys skull to smash a door through - WHY ? The skull would smash before a door would / somehow the vicious dog dies in a rubbish basket and gets thrown at the Collector like a rag doll dead / the ambulance tips over and crashes - we never discovered how that happened or how the Collector got past the police cordon in a van that had to have been hidden away after he had a chandelier covered in knives dropped on him - i could go on and on ! Not as much gore as intimated by other reviewers, the gore had already taken place, you mostly see bodies and the after effects.

God help us all - the unkillable (if that's a word) Collector seems to be set for a sequel at the end - please NO NO ! Oh yeah - I forgot to mention, when you watch the Collector closely when he walks - he obviously suffers from some kind of rheumatism as he walks like he's disabled - but when you get a closer look at the rear of him it's obvious a pensioner is playing the part !",1287792000,11,2415,4.101479915433404

4207629,4,B003UU65QK,"As someone who loves the Saw franchise, it's always interesting to see what the writers/producers do separate from that series. Sometimes they do some amazing work, such as (Darren Lynn Bousman), who was involved in Repo: The Genetic Opera, one of the most interesting musicals ever. While it wasn't gory like Saw, you could see the Saw influence in the film style, and it made for a great movie. On the flip side of that, there's also some films, such as Dead Silence (written by James Wan), which had nothing spectacular about it but was at least was a ""decent"" film. Coming into The Collector (written by Marcus Dunstan, who did Saw IV/V/VI, and soon VII), the movie could have went either way with the Saw alum track record, but I'm pleased as a whole to say it was one of the better showings thus far.

The Collector is a horror film that starts off like a drama, but quickly takes a turn into the horror/gore genre. Arkin (Josh Stewart) is a handyman who's also a thief, and the movie starts off with him starting to eye up his next big heist. After finishing up his work, he goes to meet his business partner Roy (Robert Wisdom) to discuss when the job will take place. Arkin is in a rush to get the robbery done, because he needs to pay off some of his wife's ""loans"", so that nothing happens to either her or his daughter. After convincing Roy that the job has to happen tonight, he heads on his way back to the house that he was working at earlier in the day. As soon as he steps in, and begins to break into the house, everything starts going wrong, and he needs to not only try to finish the robbery, but he finds the family members trapped in the house along the way, and feels the urge to try to save them from the torturous situation they're in.

The entire movie is great, other then one or two glaring flaws that I'll explain shortly. Everything about this movie hits the way it should. The gore scenes are pretty gross and flinch-worthy, and will definitely leave some of the more squeamish people looking away from their TV. The characters are memorable, and you'll find yourself rooting not only for Arkin to get out of the house, but for the other family members to be saved.

Since I mentioned that the movie was written by some of the Saw team, it's worth pointing out that you can definitely tell that this movie is Saw inspired...Not only by the traps and gore that line the movie, but even with the film techniques, such as using a yellow hue on the film when showing a lot of the gore scenes or the industrial music that scores the film.

The greatest flaw of this movie is that the plot to the film just instantly changes about twenty minutes in or so. The film's plot, or the plot that was advertised with the film, is that Arkin needs to steal to get money to save his wife/daughter. They go through a lot of work to set up the film to seem like a heist flick, and then out of nowhere, it turns into the escape from the haunted house from hell. Along with that, they never explain anything about the killer himself...No reason of why he picked that house, no reason of why he's the way he is, no exposition what-so-ever. And yes, it's a horror movie, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't at least give SOME reason that the killer is the way that he is.

The other glaring flaw of this movie is the house that everything takes place in. I realize that sounds really odd, but let me explain. When Arkin is first scoping out the house, there's absolutely nothing odd about it. Then, when he breaks back into the house later, there's nothing weird going on. But as soon as he touches the safe, the entire house becomes booby trapped. And it's not just small traps like ""Oh, I tripped over this wire, and I fell down the steps"", it's huge things like a staircase covered with nails, the door suddenly having seven broken deadbolts installed, or a trip wire trap that runs the entire house INCLUDING the room that Arkin is trying to crack the safe in. Even though it's a horror movie, and they usually don't make perfect sense, it's distracting in this movie that the entire house magically goes from family home to death trap in a matter of seconds.

As a whole, I really enjoyed this movie for the most part, other then some of the things I named that I feel like were a distraction. For the Saw fans, or anyone who likes a good film about being trapped, I would highly recommend this. There's also a neat throwback to the first Saw movie in the ending, but I won't spoil it in the review.",1279670400,2,4520,4.368608799048752

4207632,2,B003UU65QK,"Can't understand all the negative reviews that seem to harp on the movie being ""unrealistic"". Relentless unstoppable killer movies are never realistic. That's because the killer isn't a real human being, he is a cinematic metaphor - usually for AIDS or STDs - whose sole function in the movie is to kill off the kids who put out. This movie is a little different, though watch for the promiscuous kids still having to die. This killer represents something else - maybe our own collective dark hearts. After all on some level, aren't we getting ""something"" from this entertainment, something that perhaps, deep down where the bowels meet the id, we actually desire?

Anyways, that being said this movie is so full of plot holes there is no need to play the realism card.

Why, when the nominal ""hero"" finds someone in the house does he always say ""Be quiet"" and then he NEVER says, ""The house is full of hideous traps""? Because, when he fails to say that, people immediately run off straight into the adjoining room and then into some huge steel mantrap or barbledy wire or bladed implements and die very bloodily.

Realism in a movie such as this isn't necessary, but logical thought from characters should be.

And yes, you can make an argument for a ""torture porn"" label for this, albeit a weak one. But s*x and horrendously painful death are clearly conflated in this flick - I don't care if it's done only once - once is enough for a TP classification in this reviewer's book.",1277510400,6,1480,4.659003831417625

I enjoyed all the traps although found it quite a bit unrealistic that they could be set up that fast but hey, it's a horror film :) I thought The Collector was refreshing in that it was original and something different. The acting was not horrible and the gore was cool. The traps were scary and the fact that they didn't show the killer's face I liked. Also the humanity of the little Girl and the guy not bailing on her. I did have one complaint in that the audio was not very good. I kept adjusting the volume to hear them speak then all of the sudden a scream would come blaring out of the speakers! LOL! All in all though worth watching for sure.

I assumed it was going to be another average (or possibly below average) slasher flick with zero to none substance. Oh my goodness was I wrong. The opening scene does a great job of catching your attention while not giving anything away about the rest of the film to come. Following this scene is quite possibly the most well done opening credits scene in existence. After this is finished, and you meet the main character and supporting cast, the movie becomes somewhat dull for about 10 minutes or so. However, the rest of the movie is a fast paced terrifying gore fest that left me shocked, surprised, excited, frightened, and so on. With obvious heavy influences from Saw, (as the writers of The Collector also wrote Saw 4, 5, and 6) and more blood and sadistic violence you could ask for, this movie will not disappoint any hardcore horror fan.",1276819200,,918,4.708074534161491

The mask stays on for most of the movie and at times, it appears his eyes have an unnatural glow through the mask.
There is some sadistic violence and you never really know why he kills some people and not others but who cares anyway??

It was what should have been one 10 minute scene in the middle of a movie just stretched to 90 minutes of anti-climactic uninspired obnoxious torture scenes. You never find out anything about who the killer is or why hes there. And what little story there is with the remaining characters is completely irrelevant to the movie.

4207643,4,B003UU65QK,"""The Collector"" was written and directed by Marcus Dunstan with the writing help of Patrick Melton. The two have worked together on the Saw movies installments 4, 5, 6, and the upcoming 7 so that fact that this movie is ""Saw"" meets ""Home Alone"" is a very accurate statement. The premise is that a down-on-his-luck father needs some money by midnight and decides to rob an employer while the family is on vacation. Unfortunately, someone else got there first and has set up a series of intricate, deadly booby traps top to bottom in this mansion.

Josh Stewart stars as Arkin, a guy trying to get by on a honest day's pay for an honest day's work yadda yadda yadda, but when put in a crunch proves skilled at robberies in order to save his family from loan sharks. Little does he know that the second he enters this house, the probability of his ever seeing them again plummets dramatically. There is a dagger chandelier, an acid floor, fish hook curtains, boarded up windows rigged with razor blades, and trip wires everywhere. This is one intense journey into torture porn that only the strong can stomach. If you can't get enough ""Saw"" and wish Kevin had been just a little more naughty than paint cans in ""Home Alone"", this is your chance to see something spectacular. Cat-lovers, beware.

This house is a maze of stairways, doorways, hallways, and it can get easy to get lost so the director does a great job of showing the audience where our ""hero""...er...""hero-ish guy"" is by raising the camera over the door frames through the ceiling so you can see where the good guy is and where the bad guy is easily. There is also different lighting throughout the house. Of course, most rooms are very dark but some have bluish tints and the basement has a creepy slimer-glow.

This is one of the best scary movies I've seen in the last couple of years. There is no filler, very little exposition at the beginning, it just jumps right into the thrilling cat-and-mouse game where you keep waiting for the killer to discover someone else is in the house. One more scary note: the killer likes to put people in boxes.

This film also features a quick cameo from Claire's lesbian college friend in ""Heroes"" and yes, she gets topless so...enjoy that, I guess.

End verdict: go rent this for thrills and chills. Not a movie to eat during. Bring a pillow to shove in front of your face when it gets too freaky.",1274918400,41,2399,4.569767441860465

Intense, creepy and gory slasher movie from the writers of Saw IV and V is quite an original and startling shocker. It's been called a Torture movie but there is only a couple but not alot as this is actually a slasher movie in the Home Alone mode where are are booby-traps such as fox-traps on the floors in a hall, acid sticky glue, windows with razors etc and of course the usual stabbing. This one is also quite claustrophobic and brings back the feel of those exploitation slasher era rather than being so-called ""Torture Porn"".

This movie is a great piece of horror. the collector has no side motive to help people change their lives for good, he just wants to kill and collect. As far as back story, do I need more than I got?

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT HERE - The main character has a wife and child that he wants to keep from running away due to her debts to unsavory people. Main character shows his affiliation with other unsavories through a prison connection and why he is going to rob the people he does construction for. This sets up the whole of everything you need to know about why he is in the house and his motives for all the things he does in the movie. Again, thank the movie makers for giving a killer that doesn't have any moral delemmas about his actions and like traps because he is like a spider, thus the eyes like spider eyes.

A sub-contractor/thief has staked out his latest rich victim to burgle and this time he needs the money to help his ex-wife escape losing her knee caps to a loan shark.  That is the entire story.

The rest of the movie deals with the burglar finding the house is now a house of horror, booby-trapped with trip-wires, bear traps, razors and the master bedroom has the floor entirely covered in glue so the collector can trap the owners of the home like flies on a fly strip. The collector is a silent masked predator and we learn if he likes you, he collects you but if he doesn't want you he kills you. This info is provided by one of the collectibles confined in a large red box.

The problem with the film is, there is no explanation of how the collector was able to booby-trap the house in a short window of time and the movie is mostly a set-up for some ingenious kills including a disembowelment, but the movie comes through with the torture and gore and like Jigsaw, Jason and Freddy before him, the collector will be coming back for more blood and guts.",1272153600,10,1176,4.410138248847926

Such was my fear-filled imagination growing up at a time that horror movies were targeted at drug induced keg partying teenagers. Watching the movie ""The Collector"" brought back some of those fearful memories from that horrific era of movie watching. A time where the anticipation of what was going to happen tightened the fear in you like a pulled bow string.

This movie doesn't use the CGI tricks or creative applied make-up tactics to get a yell out of you. Instead, its a suspense-thriller that puts you in the shoes of those who are stalked. Oh, there's blood alright, but its the method of the madness causing the blood to splatter that makes you cringe.

You'll catch yourself watching and thinking at first that its not so bad a situation. But then as the little observations you've made start adding up and you begin to feel as if there's no escape, as if the closet you're locked inside is closing in on you, your calm-while-in-the-storm style begins to wear thin and the panic clock ticks just a bit faster. You want out.

And just as you think you've finally....................

Other than that, the silliness of it and the plodding, slow, kind of dim-witted killer do not really create much tension or suspense.

Let's put it this way ... when half way thru the movie my wife comments ...... ""Gee, what weenies.  Why doesn't somebody just grab a steel bar or other random object and beat this $&%^$& over the head"" ......... and then she absent mindedly watches the rest of the movie while she starts knitting ; you know the horror aspect is missing.

4207662,4,B003UU65QK,"I loved this movie.  A lot of detail is paid to the audio.  It is often dizzying, jolting and confusing, therefore adding to emotionally disruptive nature of this horror film.  Sure the killer was just a guy in a mask, but he has a unique attribute or two that make him genuinely creepy.  Most of the traps are fun and well executed.  I wish the story focused a little more on the traps and a little less on the torture though.

This movie was shot on Super 16mm so it is very grainy.  I would avoid spending the extra $$ on the Blu-Ray.  I learned my lesson with Rob Zombie's Halloween 2.  As with any 16mm film, such as these two or Ti West's House of the Devil, the appearance of film grain will peak during dark sequence, and in Hi-Def, I find it distracting and hard to see what's happening sometimes.

The Collector was bloody, brutal and original.  There were at least three instances where I caught myself saying, ""I've never seen that before!""

4207664,4,B003UU65QK,"Yes I know - I butchered Mary Botham Howitt's poem title, but it aptly describes this movie. A movie worth watching, even if you are not a 'Saw' fan. The Collector has the makings of a more than usual horror movie with all the classic plot twists. The director, Marcus Dunstan and screen-writer Patrick Melton, do well by building our reluctant hero's character that we quickly come to know him well enough and empathize with him. Arkin, (played excellently by Josh Stewart) a recently released convict, a local handy-man working for the rich Chase family, shows some innocent kindness to the Chase's youngest daughter. When Hanna invites Arkin to an imaginary tea party, Arkin asks the 10 year old Hannah, ""what would you want if you could have anything in the world?"" Hannah's reply is, ""a Basket Bear"".

The party is brief, cut short by the Hannah's father, Michael Chase - a jewelry broker, a fact that becomes salient to our plot a bit later. We meet, Michael's wife, Victoria, played by Andrea Roth, from Rescue Me - a vain woman who fears aging, and we also meet the family's angry, rebellious, teenager, Jill.

Arkin's dilemma comes in the form of his daughter, Cindy and his shark in-debted ex-wife, Lisa. Lisa needs money by midnight, and Arkin, who had just presented his daughter the brand new 'Basket Bear', promises to get her the money by midnight. Another quick scene involving Arkin's crime associate, Roy, who is played by the relatively more experienced actor, Robert Wisdom, shows Arkin's motivation for returning to the Chase's mansion. Arkin wants to rob the Chase's while they are on vacation, steal a jewel, and split 50/50 with Roy the fence. And Arkin wants to do it by midnight, tonight. Roy, warning Arkin, ""Terrible thing happen when breaking their routine"".

With all the introductions out of the way, the story moves quickly from here on out. The musical score works well by helping to bring the tension to the surface, building anxiety in the audience. Arkin sneaks back to the Chase's home and prepares to crack the safe hidden in the Chase's master bedroom behind a mirror. Arkin starts this movie, a flawed character, a desperate man, turning to crime to support his family. Do not worry; Arkin's position is about to get worse.

Arkin, hearing noises in the supposedly empty house, just as he is about to crack the safe, realizes that he is not alone. In a manner of minutes, Arkin also quickly realizes that the house is booby-trapped, rigged like a spider's web, ready to spring its many death traps. Finding the adult members of the family still in the house, Arkin ventures to the basement, tortured by, the Collector, a sexual sadist hiding behind a wrestler's mask, funky green eyes burning with hatred from within. The DVD case for 'The Collector' describes this movie as a, ""cat and mouse chase"". And for the best portion of the movie, Arkin, playing the mouse, after trying to save what's left of the tortured family, found his opportunity to escape this deadly web. He now has the jewel; all he has to do is leave. ... But can he? The remainder of the movie is an epic battle of good and evil; Arkin battling the Collector for the soul of Hannah, the family's lone survivor.

Take my humble advice and watch the opening scenes carefully for the Collector's method to his madness. Pay particular attention to the opening titles for clues on how to plan a deadly web of bear traps, a chandelier of knives, punji sticks on your stairwell, just to name a few. Watch carefully, at the beginning for the contents of the red chest left in the middle of the house. This is a good,  suspenseful, high energy, horror flick, good for a dark stormy night, and remember, ""If the Collector likes you, he keeps you; if he doesn't, he kills you.""",1269129600,4,3776,4.713636363636364
4207665,5,B003UU65QK,"I was not prepared for this movie.  I thought it was going to be similar to Saw or Hostel.  This movie bothered me unlike any other movie.  First: I think he was there to collect the little girl and put her in a box.  The old dude that was in the box said that is what he collects, everyone else he kills.  Second:  I think those traps were meant for the little girl.  Unless the collector knew the handy-man was going to return to steal the jewel. ???  The dog in the yard was a clue something was amiss because the handy-man was surprised to see the dog.  Finally:  You could check the locks on your door as many times as you like.  I don't think the Collector will see that as a challenge.  I rented this movie, but it will soon be an addition to MY collection.  Oh well, awesome movie!",1269129600,3,789,4.1118421052631575
4207666,1,B003UU65QK,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it was in theatres. So, i just rented it exclusively at blockbuster and was just terrible. The movie would have been better if it were more realistic. The way all the traps were set up, it would take a mathematical genius for hoursto do that! And some how the collector did it in the blink of an eye. So, there were many more plot-holes, and idiotic things in this movie. Don't buy it, rent it first. The only thing this movie proved is that it doesn't take a lot of money to make some gore scenes. I will credit the movie for it's hore scenes. Basically, if you're looking a story lacking, pointless gory mess, then this is the movie you'll want!",1268870400,8,702,4.325757575757576
4207667,5,B003UU65QK,"Far better than many of the other horror films out there, ""The Collector"" depends more on action and creepiness/surprise/shock than being dialogue intensive. I thought I had the ending figured out, but, no, the filmmakers threw in a surprise!

Only downside: another film that had absolutely no reason to include tobacco drug use, but did, anyway.",1268006400,2,347,5.196428571428571
4207668,5,B003UU65QK,"The Collector was one of the best lower budget,or any budget for that matter horror/slasher films I have seen in a long time.
It was intense and on edge ...

There were a couple of story lines going on but they meshed well..The characters were well done especially ""Josh Stewart"" as Arkin,the ex con with a big heart who goes into the home he had just finished doing some handy work on to steal some jewels from a safe because he thought the family were going to be out of town. He needs this money to save ""his"" family from loan sharks""But what he finds inside is far from what he thought he would. No piece of cake or slam dunk here as he had assumed .

Instead he finds himself trying to avoid well conceived and planted Saw-esque booby traps all over the house. Then ends up trying to save the very family he went to rob from a masked intruder who collects humans or what's left of them. The way it was filmed in certain places was genius .The action and carnage was non stop. The blood and gore went way past my expectations and that along with a great story, creepy killer,and Stewart's presence made for a very rewarding watch. The power struggle and cat and mouse element were great and last but never least the gore effects were highly realistic ,not campy or over the top. Definitely re watchable, a few times.",1267920000,4,1320,4.361788617886178
4207669,4,B003UU65QK,"It's pretty common place these days that professional reviewers have dubbed anything that combines mass amounts of gore, killers, and traps to be dubbed torture porn. needless to say there are quite a few movie goers, much like myself, who enjoy searching for new things to watch and go ""oooooooh.....$H1T!!!!! thas nasty!""
I heard about The Collector from [...], a movie review site that shines admirably on the horror movie genre and most of it's sub genres...torture porn being one of many. Now i had already read the review and it seemed like a very interesting flick to check out. Noted were the people from the first Saw film, which had my attention. Now mind you i think Saw was good up to part 3 (haven't seen 6 yet) so i was hoping for some freshness, much like the original Saw had brought some time ago.
The Collector had indeed filled my hope. I'm not going to fill you in with the plot since many people have already done that but i'll touch on the things most horror lovers ponder on. Yes, there was a monster amount of blood and gore. the whole trip wire thing that The Collector used throughout the house to trigger his ""homemade traps"" was very cool. I use home made very vaguely because some are extremely creative and others like the bear trap room seemed to be put there just to make you wince. The one thing that kinda got to me was how the repair man was thinking for all of two minutes and next thing you know everything...EVERYTHING is rigged and all the windows are boarded up. Either the Collector has people working for him or he is the bastard child of the Flash and Leatherface. There isn't much nudity in this movie, but that isn't to say that the amazingly beautiful Madeline Zima is nothing to look at. Her five minutes of tease are ample enough to keep the smiles gleaming. Much like any other Torture Porn movie this gem isn't very scary...it's more horror in the sense of how the hell someone could or would want to do something like this. It's that in your face OMFGWTF was that type of horror.
I don't think The Collector should be taken as a Saw ""look alike"" because it ISNT. the Jigsaw Killer used industrial tools and things that when put together generally make someone go ""oooooh. ouch."" The Collector however used general household stuff (two rooms excluded, youll know what i mean when you see them) to begin his reign of terror upon unsuspecting households. The movie is not for everyone, but for those who want something interesting instead of teeny bobber revivals and gradually dying horror icons (vampires = twilight....damn shame. and there is a werewolf one coming out to, more info on that at [...]), The Collector is definitely worth checking into.",1267833600,3,2701,4.605809128630705

This movie does for horror gender what Seven and The Usual Suspects did for policier: an instant hit!

Even though, the ideeas used in The Collector are not original, see ""People Under The Stairs"" mixed with ""The Cube"", I loved it just because it reminded me of two great movies combined together.

I haven't been so thrilled since the combination of Predator with Aliens into first AVP franchise...

8406174,5,B003UU65QK,"It's Friday night, so I felt like watching this horror thriller, in the torture porn genre. The first film directed by Marcus Dunstan, and who also wrote the screenplay along with Patrick Melton. They are known for writing screenplays for Saw 4 - 7 and Feast series. Starring Josh Stewart, Juan Fernandez, Michael Reilly Burke, Karley Scott Collins, Andrea Roth, Madeline Zima, Daniella Alonso, Robert Wisdom, Diane Goldner, William Praed, and others. Awesome performance by the cast, great special effects by Gary J. Tunnicliffe and a creepy cool soundtrack. This is a scary, gory film filled with suspense and will keep you shivering till the very end. The first time I saw it, late at night, it scared the hell out of me and even my Mum was entertained by this movie, although she hates anything to do with horror. Absolutely brilliant, beyond amazing and a masterpiece. This is the twelfth time I've watched it and it is one of my favorite movies and horror icons of all time. If you haven't seen it, you should check it out, be sure to stay until the end credits and there's also a sequel.",1517961600,,1094,4.703125
