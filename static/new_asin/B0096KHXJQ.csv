8536720,4,B0096KHXJQ,"Reviewing this opera dvd is a mixed blessing.  It is the only video that has ever been made commercially available (I have a bootleg from the 1980's of mediocre quality).  It is, of course, a VERY RARELY performed work, so having a decent video is extremely welcome.  At the same time, this opera itself was not a success in its premier (at La Scala in 1813), though it was performed for a few years around the continent after its debut- and then it disappeared).  The story is quite weak ( not much plot here), but the music is quite good, often excellent, and the performers here are very good as well.

Let me start with the opera itself. Zenobia, queen of Palmyra (Syria) is in mutual love with Prince Arsace, when the country is attacked by Rome, in the person of military leader Aureliano (also called Augustus in the libretto).  He captures them both (and the kingdom), and finds himself quite attracted to the beautiful queen.  Aureliano offers to free them if she will be his bride, which she rejects.  Arsace's soldiers rescue him (but not Zenobia) from Aureliano, and Arsace laments the loss of his beloved queen.  Aureliano captures him again, threatens to kill them both, and, after urging from Publia (who secretly loves Arsace), he pardons both of them, giving them back their kingdom, while they pledge friendship to Rome.  All in all, a pretty thin plot.

The music?  Well, that is a much richer vein. There are many excellent double arias, duets, trios and chorus numbers.  There isn't a bad tune in the whole opera.  Rossini has some very beautiful love duets (two) between Zenobia and Arsace, and several excellent and powerful arias for Arsace and Aureliano.  The music is a constant delight- no surprise since it is Rossini (even early Rossini).

As for the performance itself, there are mixed blessings here as well.  I'll start with the best- Franco Fagioli as Arsace is terrific.  This was the only role Rossini ever composed for a castrato (the famed Velluti in the waning days of the castrati).  All other recordings of this opera feature it sung by a mezzo soprano.  Here, Fagioli sings it as a countertenor. This was a revelation to me.  I hadn't seen/heard a countertenor sing anything other than Baroque opera before (though I believe that Benjamin Britten had one opera in which a countertenor was used).  It was a real treat to hear this unique voice sing Bel Canto and not Baroque tunes.  Fagioli was excellent, particularly his Act one solo aria lamenting his captured queen.  There were also two fine duets with Zenobia (one in each Act) and an excellent duet with Aureliano as well.  Maria Aleida was also quite fine (and lovely) as Zenobia, spinning out beautiful coloratura.  Bogdan Mihai was  good as Aureliano, but, as one commentator noted, he was very stiff in his stage demeanor.  In short, the three leads were very good indeed.

As for the staging?  I liked the set (pillars that looked like they were from the Roman forum- appropriate), worked quite well.  The costumes were an odd blend- Publia in a dinner dress, Aureliano and his soldiers in plaid kilts carrying assault weapons, other soldiers looking like Italian carbonieri- but overall, the unusual mix did not bother me and they worked well enough.  The action flowed up and down the stairs (this was outdoors at Martina Franca before a municipal building is how it appeared to me), and the acting, especially between Zenobia and Arsace was convincing.

I must point out something right here that one thing that strikes me very strongly when watching this dvd.  This opera was written three years before Rossini's masterpiece ""Il Barbieri di Saviglia"".  It is quite, therefore, jarring to hear several lengthy passages from that opera included in this score.  Most famously, of course, the Barbieri overture was used here as well (as well as in another earlier opera, too) That much is not jarring as it is just the opening of the piece.  But in Act two, in a recitative/aria for Arsace, it is introduced by a significant portion of the opening section of the overture, as well as during the recitative itself.  And later in Act two, a cabaletta (fast section) for another Arsace aria includes an earlier version of portions of ""Una voce poco fa"" from the same opera.  It is startling because we don't expect these intrusions, and we know them so well from that great opera.  Nothing wrong here- this opera was written first and Rossini recycled some of it for Barbieri (a very common practice for Rossini and other composers at the time).  Nonetheless, there presence here startled me.  (There are others I heard as well, but these particularly stood out.)

Finally, a word on the dvd itself.  This is the first Bongiovanni dvd I have purchased, and the production values were quite poor.  There were no audio choices (DTS, Dolby, PCM) and only two subtitle choices (English and Italian).  More disturbing the camera work was consistently shaky, and the sound was very thin.  The orchestra did not have much depth or resonance.  Everything was clear, but it was not a rich sound.  The subtitles had a few linguistic errors but no miss-spellings.  There are no extras on the dvd at all.

Surprisingly, the booklet with the dvd was very good.  Since this opera is so little known, and even my two main sources (Penguin Guide to Opera and Grove Dictionary of Opera) had very small entries.  The essay was quite detailed in its background of the opera, its history and the original performers, and it had a very detailed synopsis.  Kudos here.

In short, if you are interested in Rossini, then, by all means, watch this dvd.  It is certainly lesser Rossini, and the plot is weak, but the music is a delight, and the performers are strong.",1359763200,11,5740,4.771573604060913

The singing is better than the acting. And the music is far better than the perfunctory libretto deserves! In fact, the music is too good for anything less than a five star critique, given especially that the singing is inspired. Don't rush to scorn this opera seria as an ""immature"" work or a ""failure at its first premiere""! It was indeed a failure at La Scala in 1813, but if you don't instantly recognize the overture and several of the arias, you're no kind of Rossini fan. Young Gioachino knew he had ""good stuff"" in this opera and made sure to re-cycle the best of it.

The drama centers on the conquest of Palmira by the Roman Emperor Aurelian, who hankers for the Syrian queen Zenobia who is true-to-the-death to the Persian Prince Arsace. Set in what looks like a ruined Greek temple, the story has been 'modernized' in costuming, with the Roman in the kilts of a 19th C British army and the Palmirans in Bedouin-stle robes. Both sides wield modern AK47s. There's also some silly business with non-singing never-identified specters on stage. Some of the stage business is highly stylized and hieratic in movement, while at other times the singer/actors emote fluidly. Don't worry too much about the staging. It's minimally distracting, never in conflict with the expressiveness of the music, and simply a bit clumsy. The singing amply makes up for it.

Falsettist alto Franco Fagioli sings Arsace, a role Rossini created specifically for Velluti, the last famous castrato of his era. Rossini had high regards for the castrati and always lamented their disappearance from the world of Bel Canto singing. Fagioli's alto is markedly stronger and more theatrical than that of most countertenors; if Velluti or any other castrato sang ""better"" than Franco Fagioli, then ""we"" really have lost something of great worth musically and might need to reconsider our notions of propriety. Fagioli, by the way, projects enough masculinity in his voice to make the character of the indecisive Arsace Plausible.

Tenor Bogdan Mihai, in the role of the Roman conqueror, is stiff enough on stage to be in the line of succession for the Crown of Great Britain. I think his dramatic intention is to appear haughty, but perhaps his rigidity of posture was the fault of director Timothy Nelson or choreographer Nikos Lagousakas. Fortunately, Mihai's singing is anything but stiff. He combines a fine ringing tenor timbre with the vocal agility of a Bel Canto soprano.

Queen Zenobia is sung by Maria Aleida, whose Bel Canto pyrotechnics inflamed the live audience at this recorded performance to sustained applause and bellows of brava! Aleida is Cuban, trained in Venezuela, land of the best and broadest music education program in the world. To my ears, her highest coloratura notes were thinner in timbre than the rest of her range, but then those notes were very high indeed, the sort of pitches usually only heard by bats. Time will tell whether she's a rising star or a shooting star in the fiercely competitive heaven of opera.

All voices were recorded through contact mikes, with Bogdan Mihai's mike gleaming alongside his chiseled cheekbones. The voices do at times overpower the orchestra, but that's a minor fault. Bel Canto, whether seria or giocosa, is all about gorgeous singing, and that's what this performance offers aplenty.",1359331200,6,3497,4.960750853242321
