1413737,3,B00005AAEH,"This was an interesting program, but it is important to note that it was not produced from a religious perspective;  there is little if anything here having to do with dogma or theology.  What it does do, however, is try to explain biblical events from measureable criteria, like science or archaeology.  Some of the things you'll see are:  the type of house or dwelling where Jesus may have been born (maybe not the traditional ""manger"" scene);  a fishing boat recovered from the Sea Of Galilee dating to the first century (the famous ""Jesus Boat""); the town of Caperneum and the possible house of St. Peter; and several digitized recreations of places like first-century Bethlehem and Jerusalem, giving the viewer an idea of how things might have looked during Jesus' lifetime.

From a scientific viewpoint, there are discussions about the possibility of a virgin birth, the astronomical events that may have led to the story of the wise men following a star, the length of time a crucified man could survive on a cross, and even a computer-generated ""educated guess"" about what a 1st-century man from Nazareth might look like.

Overall this was an informative video, but again, it is not a religious lesson and it is assumed the viewer already knows a few things about Jesus of Nazareth.  Viewed with that in mind, it's not bad.  Three stars.",1200873600,15,1345,4.864035087719298
1413738,5,B00005AAEH,A great DVD. Better production than the original BBC one i brought a few years ago. Plenty of info I didn't know about Jesus's life.,1169424000,,132,4.32
1413739,5,B00005AAEH,"If one is looking for a documentary on the life and teaching of Jesus, this one is about as objective as it gets.  While this documentary addresses questions and gives answers to some of the most common questions regarding Jesus, the Christ, it also address some of the challenges to some of the commonly held beliefs.  For an objective mind, this documentary is worth viewing.

  Apparently, there are at least two different narrators to this documentary.  I wanted the one narrated by Avery Brooks; however, the one I got was narrated by Tom Hodgkins.",1145491200,5,553,4.829787234042553
1413740,4,B00005AAEH,"I found this movie very interesting and quite enjoyable.

I have been a Christian for over 20 years and have watched

many documentaries, this one was easy to watch and it had

many interesting visual techniques explaining the times Jesus lived in.  I especially liked when they took

an ancient ruin and built a city on top of it using digital drawings.  In another part of this film a man sculpted the face

of Jesus - I find this fascinating.  No mention of any special

physical attributes are mentioned in the Bible, so he must

have been just ordinary looking. I hope you will at least

give this movie a try, they did a great job.",1135555200,10,637,4.405172413793103
1413741,5,B00005AAEH,"I was amazed by this film, the fact that science was applied to the bible and many elements of 'Christ"" that people discount as fairy tale, were put to the acid test, was great. I spent 35 years of my life not believing in Christ and the last 10 believing. As a Christian I have no doubt of Christ and all that goes with Him, as a former non  believer I completely understand the denial and blatant rejection of Christ. This film is a film that I can take to non- believers (that are objective) and try to separate the spiritual experience from the technical 'factual' proofs  which are abundant.
I find it interesting that the person posting below me is so certain that Jesus never existed. Just like that, he boldly states his truth but without any evidence, without research, without warrant, and  I dare say more than likely without real soul searching and a deep thirst for any truth outside of his own.  He offers no evidence just criticism and opinion and he bases it upon nothing.
I believe that anybody looking for truth or answers would be interested in a film of  this sort. But a person who watches anything knowing their own truth from the beginning and having complete unwillingness to find balance, is destine to be one of those who in an ignorant and haphazard bliss, throws all (good and bad) to the wind.
If this film and its makers have sweat to put forth scientific and logical evidence and on top of that they found a way to convey all of these things quite well to the lay person, it is my suggestion that when making a comment such as ""Jesus is A Mythological Figure"" that you continue on and explain your scientific or long researched reason for this statement.
And when reducing the work of this film to a comment like
""People have to start swaying away from the manipulations of the church and the filmmaking industry and start looking at the hard facts"" that you realize what denial you must be in to even think to say such a thing since this show is based upon fact and research and logic and your comment seems to be based upon arrogance, and sensationalism.
I am certainly interested and willing to listen to those who can dispute certain facts, because they are educated and or have emotional or life experience in which they can lay their claim. This film is thought provoking and deserves at least that in return.",1118275200,5,2346,4.510588235294118
1413742,2,B00005AAEH,"I enjoy reading and watching documentaries on the early years of Christianity. When the Discovery Channel premiered this documentary several years ago I watched it. Several things popped out at me while watching the 4-hour broadcast. I recently borrowed it from my library to watch again and see if I'd like to purchase it. A big NO and here is why.

One thing this documentary states is that the Gospels can not be trusted because they are based on oral history. According to the show's producers, only archeologists can tell us what ACTUALLY happened with the life and death of Jesus. This is an incorrect assumption. It's my understanding that you can line up three people standing in the same place seeing the same car accident and all three will have the same basic story but their stories won't be exact. Does that mean their stories can't be trusted?

Read the following quotes from the narration of the program and you can decide if you want to watch or buy this program:

""'Something' must have stirred his(Jesus) determination to right the wrongs he saw in his society."" Hmmm--what could that something be? According to this program, perhaps when you are the son of God you still need motivation.

When picking his apostles, Jesus was said to have ""a bizarre recruitment drive."" I used to be a journalist and when I see or hear ""documentaries"" using adjectives such as above shows that the writer is not being objective. Who says the way he picked his apostles was bizarre besides the creators of the program?

Here is the one that turned my head: ""He was baptized by John. This simple act seems to have CONVINCED him he was the long-awaited Messiah."" I'll let you make up your own mind on that one.

I won't even get into the fact that the program states ""it is a well-known and documented fact that Jesus had sisters and brothers.""  Well, there are about a billion Catholics who beg to differ on that one and I won't go into that argument.

I am not impressed by the assumptions the writers and producers of this program made and try to pawn off as ""fact"".

Overall a very subjective view and not ""complete"" in any way. If you do buy, buy with caution. But I say this about most religious/historical documentaries.  There is a point where science can not answer all the questions asked.  I once heard that ""Faith is believing in something when common sense tells you not to.""

If you are truly interested in a more balanced look at Jesus and the early church, try Frontline: From Jesus to Christ produced by PBS in 1998 or the Rise of Christianity: The first 1000 years. They at least show more than one side to some Jesus stories, such as whether Jesus had brothers and sisters.  They also do not foist a lot of subjective adjectives onto the viewer.",1112140800,96,2763,4.60285132382892
1413743,4,B00005AAEH,This series from BBC is a great introduction and overview of Jesus and his life work.  I gave only 4 stars because I felt it was not in depth and left out some very important research and information.  The presentation of information was great and kept me and my husband intersted throughout.  Very good quality.  Great for a new Christian who wants to get a some good quick information without being bogged down by too much.,1107475200,15,425,4.552631578947368
1413744,5,B00005AAEH,"I tend to be very skeptical of ""life of Jesus"" illustrations.  I watch a lot of historical programs on previous cultures, and I understand that while the science can determine and confirm certain aspects, it is easy to extrapolate into fictionalized accounts and storytelling.
  There have been other ""scientific"" searches for Jesus, using archeological evidence, but they are often so obviously done by non-Christians, or even anti-Christians, that their bias is clear while they pretend to be impartial.  This series does have a bias, too.  It is produced by theologians, and yes, they clearly have belief; but they do not push that aspect.  Rather, this program says this ""X"" (science) proves this ""Y"" (biblical description) to be true.  They compare it to other events, but do not make assumptions, but leave the rest for your own conclusions.  I found this series fascinating, well done, and balanced, using scientific process to illuminate biblical text, and relate it to today.  The forensic reconstruction is particularly interesting. A very practical application of science to help us deconstruct iconography.  A great gift for a thinking Christian.",1064361600,61,1158,5.313186813186813
1413745,5,B00005AAEH,"This 3-boxed set of beautiful, documentary-style videos examines the life and times of the historical Jesus Christ within the backdrop of First-century Judea's troubles and turmoil -vs- the awaited hope of many in the Messiah of Israel.  It examines the  life of Jesus in light of the Bible, the Old and New Testament Scripture, and the Gospel account, as further supported by the Qumran Dead Sea Scrolls.  The video is straightforward at  examining the evidence within the context of scientific and historical inquiry and data, Bible accounts, as well as opening up the discussion of the Resurrection of Jesus to a matter of one's own deep, interpersonal faith.  The evidence is shown to withstand the test of time, even after 2000 years!  It's a realistic and poignant view of life in the First-century and the best presentation of the life of Jesus that I've seen so far, aside from the Franco Zeffirelli version of 'Jesus of Nazareth'.  This video encourages further exploration into who  Jesus was... and is!  It really brings a person as close to a knowledge of Jesus aside from the intimate look at His life as presented in the Bible.  Experts of diverse specialties, from Israel, Great Britain, and France, were consulted on this project.  The BBC outdid itself with this series!  It puts the viewer in tune with the emotional and spiritual aspect of the crucifixion.  See the beautiful, first temple recreated here, as well as the surrounding cities.  You'll get a feel for the era.  This is a candid video presentation which I recommend to all.  I cannot say enough about it.  Visit settings such as Bethlehem, Nazareth, Jerusalem, Gethsemane, the Mount of Olives, the city of Sepphorus, and Cesaria in recreations of how it all appeared in Biblical times.  Fascinating and inspiring, will undoubtedly bring students, teachers, seekers, and followers closer to the saving knowledge of God's grace!",1003363200,45,1907,5.019108280254777

1413749,5,B00005AAEH,"The producers have done a wonderful job of taking the viewer to the lands in which the story of Jesus took place and then, through the use of stunning computer generated graphics, giving a ""now and then"" view to what those same lands would have looked like in the days of Jesus.  Vistas of Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Jerusalem would have by themselves been worth the cost of this DVD set.  But they go on to paint a careful and concise portrait of the historical and cultural background to the accounts of the life of Jesus Christ.

1413750,5,B00005AAEH,"I enjoyed this dvd very much.  I like the information given, and the information in the dvd goes right along with the information I just read in Stephen Miller's book, The Jesus Of The Bible.  I especially love how they recreate the ancient cities and show us what life was probably like in Bible times, that was interesting.  The only thing I thought was absurd was the lady mentioning the resurrection happening because Jesus didn't actually die during the crucifixion.  I thought that was an insane theory!!  Jesus did die and was gloriously resurrected.  The Glorious Resurrection is also given in this dvd and they actually dispute what the lady says, thankfully.  This dvd really is open to faith and what Christianity teaches.  I also didn't like the comment about Judas given by the man who said there wasn't a betrayal.  This contradicts scriptures, but this comment didn't take away my interest in the dvd.  This is a good addition to anyone's study.",1240272000,,960,4.8343558282208585

1413753,5,B00005AAEH,I first saw this story on Easter of 2008. I was getting over the flu and had been watching a lot of History and Discovery channel shows. I happened upon this one and was instantly glued to the TV. I was so enthralled with this show that I wanted to go back in time and be with Him. I loved it so much I bough the DVD. I enjoyed it because it makes you think as to what Jesus did. How he came to this world and why he was the chosen one. It also gives you a surprise view as to the most probable look of Jesus. I highly recommend this DVD. It'll make your heart feel good.,1209081600,6,571,3.80672268907563

I am very pleased with my purchase and would encourage any individuals interested in the life and times of Jesus to watch this program.",1208995200,,386,4.162162162162162
1413755,5,B00005AAEH,"If you are looking for a dramatization of the English Language Bible translation, then this may not be for you.

This documentary is a very good tool for BIBLE STUDY GROUPS as it helps one ponder the true writings of the Bible.  It never says what Christians believe is false, it just presents several alternative translations of the original language of the Bible.

I watch this documentary every time it airs & plan to buy the DVD.  It is not athiestic, it just questions the translations of the Bible and points out that it was not hand written by the Apostles.  The stories had been told by word of mouth, they do not discount the stories but just point out that there is room for error.
The producers never say the events didn't happen, they just present all alternatives in translating the original text of the Bible.

For example, the English text of the birth of Jesus says there was no room at the ""Inn"" and he had to be born in a ""Manger"".  The documentary points out a possible error in the translation, the word translated into ""Inn"" probably does not refer to a hotel type of building, but rather the sleeping quarters of a home.  And the ""Manger"" was really the area of the home where the livestock was kept.  Upper & lower levels of the home.

This will open up discussions of the Bible, and give new possibilities to its meaning.",1207872000,,1345,4.475409836065574

7935353,5,B00005AAEH,I have been looking for this particular DVD for years! I saw the special when it originally aired and have wanted to rewatch it and share it with a few people (mostly people stuck on the white Jesus with blond hair & blue eyes).

7935356,1,B00005AAEH,"I was very disappointed in the film. I thought it was a movie and found it to be more of a documentary.
