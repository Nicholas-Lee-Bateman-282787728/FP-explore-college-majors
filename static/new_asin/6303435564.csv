Complete eh expecting what i saw in the first two, but decent, just not as good but as a anime movie goes its ok on its own without relation to the first two. I say pass this one up or watch online first",1363132800,,303,3.8253968253968256

It's not that it's a bad anime, but there are much better out there.  The story is pretty typical.  School girl gets special ability, fights intergalactic evil,  World hangs in the balance.  Fan service is pretty prevelant thru much of the show.  For the mostpart, you cannot watch this anime if you are a fan of deep immersive animes (aka Evangelion, Last Exile).  It's meant for those of us that just want the fighting, fan service, and simple plot line.",1138147200,,565,4.534653465346534
