8586170,4,B00CTRQLEQ,"The first season of Crocodile Shoes was excellent.  The second...not so much.  In season one we had record wiz Adrian (James Wilby) floundering because his career has fallen on hard times.  Music has changed, and he's not feeling the new stuff, plus he has a bit of a substance abuse problem.  Then he hears a tape made by bumpkin Jed that he thinks could be his ticket back to the top of the music biz.  To further complicate matters, Ade's girlfriend is a backstabbing, two-timer, and his boss and supposed friend Rex cannot be trusted.  Adrian's life is just really interesting.  On the other hand, we have Jed (Jimmy Nails) who is supposed to be the star of this story.  Frankly, didn't find his story all that interesting.  He's just a working Joe trying to become the next Springsteen.  His story is just not that compelling.  Adrian is not part of the second season.  I won't do a spoiler by telling you why he's gone, but without that character, this isn't as interesting.",1461283200,,980,4.601156069364162
