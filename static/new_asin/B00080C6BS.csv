Its funny that the guy below is an 'author' and is long winded in his endeavor of trying to be eloquent in his berating you. ;) I put some other comments up for you guys cause I'm stoked that there are decent videos out there. So bikers/runners , swimmers if you can manage, watch the video. Call a friend, get him to get the video. But check it out.

Thanks again guys!",1173571200,4,501,4.164948453608248
2255213,5,B00080C6BS,This video is not only worth the purchase to encourage one to excercise (and enjoy it) but the photography and music is extremely beautiful. I am viewing an area I've never seen (but hope to) and hearing music I've never heard. Its like excercising in a theater. So worthwhile for so little money. What an adventure!,1115251200,10,316,4.660714285714286
2255214,5,B00080C6BS,"I've reviewed several other Bike-O-Vision Cycling DVDs. They are all excellent.

This one is like going for a ride in the country, very beautiful country, which happens to be wine country. The scenery is beautiful and it's pretty much straight down the road, not twisting mountain rides as some of them have been.

I usually experience these DVDs on my treadmill. They typically run about 75 minutes. This one said on the cover it was 82 minutes, but I think the promotional material said 90, probably counting the introduction and teasers for other DVDs. This time I did it differently and I think I'll mix it up a little from now on.

I started on the treadmill for about 30 minutes, then I switched to the elliptical machine for 20 minutes, then finished it on my indoor bike. All of them gave me the feel of actually being there.

My favorite is still California Coastline, followed by Northern California, with the others fighting for 3rd place. There is not one loser in the bunch. I have more ordered. It's fun to travel and get in shape at the same time!",1267315200,4,1062,4.573684210526316
2255215,3,B00080C6BS,Nice way to pass the time when exercising. Nice music. Beautiful scenery but save the sipping until afte cycling.,1264464000,,113,5.0
2255216,1,B00080C6BS,this is low budget and is a guy in a van with a video camera and some background music. do not waste your money.,1248220800,,112,3.7083333333333335
2255217,4,B00080C6BS,"This type of video is a great way to get through a stationary bike session or running on a treadmill because it makes the time go quickly and gives you something interesting to watch making it seem more like you're actually riding in beautiful Napa Valley.  I liked that this DVD had a nice variety of areas like the Napa Vineyards, Sonoma County, Siverado Trail, Russian River and Cameros.  The video was stable and smooth and it turned and took you up to some of the wineries on the trail.

The background music is classical, some of it I liked and some I wished were a little more relaxing.  But I guess for exercising the quick pace is good for motivation.  It would be easy to turn the sound down and fire up your iPod or stereo if you don't like classical music.

The only thing I didn't like is that the resolution wasn't as good as it could have been.  Even when riding past a road sign it was too fuzzy to read what it said, even when I viewed it on a 19 inch computer monitor.  I haven't tried it on an upconverting HDTV.  Perhaps that would make it a little better.",1241222400,6,1076,4.235294117647059
2255218,5,B00080C6BS,"Excellent indoor biking experience.  Got this one and then many more.  The time spins by while cycling to this fun DVD.  The scenery is outstanding and you really feel like you are in California. The Senoma County ride ROCKS!  I love all of the Bike-O-Vision locations although am especially fond of the Sedona, Nevada, Zion Nat. Park, and California DVDs. Can't wait to get on my bike again for the next adventure.",1231804800,2,415,4.722222222222222
2255219,5,B00080C6BS,I was looking for a dvd just like this to make indoor biking less work. Ths music is great!,1229558400,,91,3.8421052631578947
2255220,4,B00080C6BS,Music is not motovating at all so I just mute it and play my own.,1222732800,2,65,3.4
2255221,3,B00080C6BS,"My husband wanted this for his birthday and he likes it and finds it relaxing.  If I am riding a bike to exercise, this would not do it for me.",1222214400,2,143,3.7666666666666666
2255222,2,B00080C6BS,"This is a nice sedate drive through the wine country without a single bicycle to be seen. It could be a great video for Charles Kurwalt's sunday morning show, complete with the classical music. It is not a training video.",1191283200,7,221,4.55
2255223,5,B00080C6BS,"I own several of these, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the wine country edition.  Such beautiful landscapes and I know I would never be able to actually bike all the way through Napa Valley (especially tipsy on wine....)  Very nice scenery!",1173657600,5,247,4.72093023255814
8054908,5,B00080C6BS,"VHS tapes are obviously hard to find.  I had a three other videos in this series that I enjoy using, and was happy to find one more.  It arrived in excellent condition, even though previously used (hard to tell).",1443312000,,212,4.410256410256411
8054909,5,B00080C6BS,Bought this for those days I just want to ride my spinner without an yelling and coaching. Music is a bit too mellow for me  but love the scenery. Would recommend.,1388620800,,163,4.258064516129032
8054910,1,B00080C6BS,It really is my own fault.  I should have made a better selection.  This one is just too long and boring for me.,1355529600,,112,3.8260869565217392
8054911,1,B00080C6BS,"If the CVB of Napa Valley got a load of this video they'd likely lobby to disassociate from material in these pictures.  I've never been in this part of CA and the views presented in this film certainly don't entice me to ever visit.  I ordered this particular video from Bike-O-Vision because of its high acclaim among the collection. If this is their best, how anyone would order another after viewing this . . . well,  it's a wonder.  Scene after scene of dead-looking vineyards on mostly deserted roads makes one think they shot this footage in mid-winter when traffic was minimal.  As for ""cycling"" along with the views and the misaligned music at 30 mph . . . forget it.  Save your money and look elsewhere.",1355356800,,713,4.574803149606299
8054912,4,B00080C6BS,"As beautiful as it is functional, this workout will bring you some of the most gorgeous scenery from the California wine country and do it with a solid musical score and plenty of hill work to give you a rewarding exercise experience.",1349913600,,234,4.595238095238095
8054913,3,B00080C6BS,"Was a little disapointed with the video. Expected more of a Actual ""Ride Experience"" video. Found it to be more of a sight seeing video.",1331424000,,136,4.48
8054914,3,B00080C6BS,"First, I have to say the scenery is lovely and the music is acceptable. However, this DVD was promoted as a ""bike ride"" through California Wine Country.  It actually appears to have been filmed from a moving vehicle at speeds of at least 25-30 mph, which is not a ""bike ride"". There is no speed adjustments for climbing up grades or riding down hills. I ride my bike so I can take time to enjoy the scenery as I ride vs. speeding by in a car. The filming speed of this DVD takes away the enjoyment of the ride. I am not sure I would recommend this DVD to a friend.",1309737600,,564,4.081081081081081
8054915,4,B00080C6BS,"A beautiful trip through the vineyards in California.  The only thing I missed was the names of the vineyards and wineries as we passed by.  The signs were ""avoided"" which I found distracting.  I would have liked to end this video with a shot of sitting at a table outdoors at a winery - enjoying a glass of wine and a snack!",1301961600,,325,4.209677419354839
8054916,1,B00080C6BS,"I've been using spinning DVDs for years. I love Mindy Mylrea's Spinning DVDs. This is actually the first workout DVD I've ever bought including those for pilates, yoga, stretching, that I've regretted. IT IS NOT A WORKOUT. The reviewer who labeled it as ""crap"" was right. Don't bother. SOOOOO not worht it.
Who works out to classical music??? Please. Plus even the sound/video quality seemed cheap.",1286841600,,398,5.045454545454546
8054917,3,B00080C6BS,"I have 5 Bike O Vision DVD's and the scenery is awesome but the use and reuse of the same classical music in different DVD's
really is a let down. I thought this video in particular was tedious.  I'm an older guy, but come on, give me some jazz or anything
with a beat.  This was not motivating at all.",1270598400,,302,4.016666666666667
