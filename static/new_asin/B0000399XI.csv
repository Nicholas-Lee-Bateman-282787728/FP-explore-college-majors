7916936,5,B0000399XI,"Make no mistake, this isn't some typical stupid crap movie.  ""Tail Lights Fade"" is a well written little film with good performances from everybody.  It has a good story, it's funny, the cinematography is great, and the behavior of the characters is pretty believable. They reminded me of friends of mine. Highly recommended.",1304812800,3,325,5.113207547169812

7916938,4,B0000399XI,"I caught this movie late night on HBO. I figured it was just a bad Denise Richard's vehicle. Turns out I was wrong. It's a entertaining movie that follows a likeable cast of characters on their merry adventurer to the grow house in Toronto. It's not Citizen Kane, but it's a fun movie not withstanding",1052006400,3,301,4.490909090909091
7916939,4,B0000399XI,"I liked this movie, but Elizabeth Berkley can do better. She's a great actress with a lot of talent. This wasn't the right project for her. Other than that... it was an okay movie. I wouldn't buy it if she wasn't in it. I'd probably only rent it.",970876800,4,246,4.145833333333333
7916940,2,B0000399XI,"This movie looked so promising and started out OK, but things went downhill fast.  I figured it would be good, simple entertainment...but it was just a frustrating movie to watch.  The writing is inconsistant, with  poorly developed characters who seem to keep changing and a plot that  offers pretty good promise but never delivers.  The twists seem poorly (or  not) thought out, and the ending simply doesn't make sense.
I would have  rated this movie at a single star had there been no promise, but the movie  starts out reasonably well.  Too bad it is so badly wasted!",957916800,8,572,4.755102040816326
