Since I opened the wrapper before I noticed the country code  and never experienced it before I could not return it.  That was my error and learning experience.  However, I did find the movie ""In My Sleep"" on Amazon Prime online and ordered it that way, was able to watch it and that movie was as good as I hoped it would be.  And I paid for it.  So as long as I keep Amazon Prime, I will always have the ability to watch that movie and believe me I will.",1460678400,,573,3.982456140350877
