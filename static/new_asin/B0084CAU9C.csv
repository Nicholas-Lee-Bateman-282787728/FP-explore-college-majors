5130488,5,B0084CAU9C,"Wobderful! A perfect blend of comedy, romance, and poignant characters.  The story is truly original. The actors -- all well known stars -- are at the top of their game. Excellent direction. Particularly wonderful performances by Ed Asner, Gillian Jacobs (""Community"") and Kevin Hart. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll understand the meaning of living in the moment, every day. See it!!",1339200000,4,389,5.274193548387097

5130492,3,B0084CAU9C,I was surprised to see Kevin Hart in such a heavy role but he pulled it off.  I enjoyed the movie even though it did lag in a couple of places.  If you just want to watch an entertaining drama - this is the movie for you.,1434412800,,221,3.6808510638297873

5130495,4,B0084CAU9C,"Wow - this was funny and touching at the same time.  I love it when a director takes real life ""stuff"" that happens to people and portrays it in a new and interesting way. Kevin Hart was great; Ed Asner - fabulous!  Glad I rented it.",1376697600,,233,4.043478260869565
5130496,5,B0084CAU9C,"This was an awesome movie, I am planning on watching it again soon.  I totally took a chance, and was pleasantly surprised.  It surpassed my expectations.  I especially liked Kevin Hart's role (which I think his acting was impressive since he's only done comedy), but the others were really good also.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the acting of the female lead role.  She wasn't a very good actress, and I think the part could have been done alot better, but because of who the character was, it did work well enough.  (The character is a very fake personality, so with this person playing it, the fake-ness was obvious, a little too obvious)  But I thought the concept was not extremely original, but really interesting.  Over all, a great movie, well done.",1359936000,2,780,4.642335766423358
5130497,5,B0084CAU9C,"I enjoyed this movie very much.  It's fun, quirky, and entertaining.  The biggest thrill was seeing Kevin Hart in a non-comedic role.  A great cast and well written story for a first time director.  It's also always refreshing to see what independent films are out there.",1359417600,,271,4.826086956521739
5130498,5,B0084CAU9C,"I loved this movie!!!
Especially:
1. the animated title sequence and scene transitions
2. the interesting use of color - particularly red
3. the surprisingly good performances by comedic actors from The Office, Community, and The Big Bang Theory
4. the recurring thread of the Santa Monica Pier
5. the use and placement of the Other Lives song ""Black Tables""
Definitely worth watching!",1358294400,,385,5.126984126984127
5130499,5,B0084CAU9C,"The movie has a fine plot with many interesting characters. I enjoyed all the actors, and this film is definitely a keeper.",1357948800,,123,4.636363636363637
5130500,5,B0084CAU9C,"Walter Dishman (David Denman) is a parole officer who is in life's rut. He is straight and wears sweaters like Rick Santorum and is just as boring. His character is contrasted by a gaggle of colorful characters which include the supporting minor roles.

He has three parolees whose lives we follow.

Darla (Gillian Jacobs) She is a pretty blond who is amoral, manipulative, and has her own jazz swagger music. She went to jail for selling her engagement ring on E-Bay. As it turns out her boyfriend stole it.

Artie Satz (Edward Asner) He has a long rap sheet for armed robbery. He is a curmudgeon's curmudgeon. He doesn't need anyone. He was ""survived two world wars, the Great Depression and that Coke crap they tried to pull in the eighties.""

Kris Styles (Kevin Hart). He is a doctor who was convicted of bilking insurance companies. He can no longer practice and is wealthy enough not to work. The kicker is that work is part of his parole so he finds himself in blue collar jobs that don't suit him. He has ex-wife emotional baggage.

The film concentrates on creating memorable characters down to the Goth at the coffee shop to the over bubbly career counselor. The film is humorous and well done. This would make for a decent date night film, or even a film on family night for the older kids.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1355097600,3,1346,4.5875
5130501,5,B0084CAU9C,"Very well written and directed- I loved the cast, great actors portraying such a diverse array of characters.  I felt like I connected with this movie.  I really enjoyed the last two lines of the movie and am now am remembering to apply those to my own life.  Thank you for making this movie.",1353110400,2,292,4.37037037037037
5130502,5,B0084CAU9C,Loved the story line and what a cast!  Didn't realize Kevin Hart was such a good actor and not just a great comedian.  Perfect role for Ed Asner and it was fun to see the other cast members on the big screen.,1350777600,,208,3.9285714285714284
5130503,5,B0084CAU9C,We just loved the movie. It is suitable for all ages. I wish more movies of this quality were available for family viewing.,1348358400,2,123,4.391304347826087
5130504,1,B0084CAU9C,"We didn't watch the whole movie, and I'd like to get the time we watched it back, what a total waste of time.",1348185600,,109,3.782608695652174
5130505,4,B0084CAU9C,"Never thought I would enjoy it, but to my surprise, the 90 minutes or so flew by.  I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys movies that portray real people and not people living in a fantasy.  Great cast and storyline.",1346112000,2,221,4.365853658536586
5130506,2,B0084CAU9C,"For years I loved Ed Asner's acting on TV - first on the comedy The Mary Tyler Moore Show and later on the dramatic TV series Lou Grant. I've seen him act on stage and I was always impressed. Two years ago he provided the voice for one of the characters in Pixar's animated film ""up"". Another triumph. But lately.....

In the last six months I've seen two ""independent"" films with Asner's name at the top of the cast and both had him playing a crusty old man, who the filmmaker wanted you to sympathize with. Now comes this film with Asner in the ""same old, same old"" caricature role. And why is he here? Probably because - as you'll find out if you make it through the 108 minutes to the closing credits - he is the film's Executive Producer!

I like small independent films but this was a huge let down. The characters were overdrawn to be a parody - when some are supposed to be serious. The camera angles are so bad that the adults look like they are sitting on child furniture. And the makeup is atrocious, especially on the women. I wasn't familiar with any of the cast except Asner and Simon Helberg (one of the four ""brainiacs"" on ""The Big Bang Theory"" - a show I love. You'll see Helberg's picture on both the front and the back of the DVD package but don't expect to see much of him in this film. His role is so small; you might miss him.

The ""star"" - David Denman - looks like a poor man's Will Farrell. And acts like a piece of cardboard.

The DVD comes with a feature length audio commentary with both the writer/director and Denman. I did not have the patience to sit through that.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5130507,5,B0084CAU9C,"What a truly refreshing movie.  It is well-paced, thoughtful, visually stunning with great acting.  It reminds me of a movie from a long ago era, when movies told stories and weren't relient on special effects and hip soundtracks.  Anyway, for something different, definately check this movie out.",1346025600,5,297,5.276595744680851
5130508,2,B0084CAU9C,"This is a movie that is allegedly a comedy, but is, in fact perhaps the saddest most depressing motion picture I've ever endured. And it's not really sad in a good way, where my heart goes out to the characters. Instead I was just left felling incredibly melancholy and depressed. It's a movie about sad people being depressed. It's not funny. On the other hand, it'd be a pretty damn pathetic drama. Because the film is focusing on so many different and unrelated stories, and because it takes a very leisurely pace establishing the stories through the first hour of the film, a couple of the stories seem to miss most of the ""third act"" and jump right to an ending without feeling earned. The acting, particularly the performance of Kevin Hart, is really first rate, and the film has a distinct, consistent and memorable visual style. Unfortunately, these are all drowned out by the mess of a script. I hope to see Brian Jett direct more movies in the future, so long as somebody else writes them. As it is, Let Go is not worth seeing.",1345852800,3,1037,4.550802139037433
5130509,4,B0084CAU9C,"""I don't think anyone actually wants to become a parole officer."" Walter is a parole officer who isn't happy with his job. One by one a new offender comes to him and he has to lay out the rules. During his recent sting of offenders he meets three very different personalities and does his best to try and help them all. He finds that helping them he starts to help himself. Going in I was not really looking forward to this that much. The preview made it look OK but I still thought it could be a little slow moving. This was the opposite. The humor was really funny but still a little quirky. Kevin Hart was great in this and he really stole the movie. There really isn't too much to this movie other then all four of the main people trying to straighten out their lives but this is worth seeing. This is the type of movie you can just put in and watch without really having to think about too much and every once in a while that is nice to do. Overall, a fun lighthearted comedy that is relaxing to watch. I give it a B.",1345334400,3,1022,4.115

Hollywood smut and lack of taste!",1343692800,,108,4.45
5130514,5,B0084CAU9C,"This movie was recommend to me by a friend and I really loved it.  Very quirky and funny, but also very touching.  It has an amazing ensemble cast led by: Kevin Hart, David Denman Gillian Jacobs, Ed Asner and Simon Helberg; and the performances are superb through out.  It is also one of those movies that still has you thinking about it days later.  Thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end, you're in for a real treat!",1343606400,,425,4.552631578947368

5130516,5,B0084CAU9C,"Saw this movie in a Savannah theater and was very impressed with Bryan Jett's work.
He accomplished many different emotions in clever ways so it was both sad and funny.",1343520000,,168,4.633333333333334
5130517,5,B0084CAU9C,"I really enjoyed ""Let Go"" by Brian Jett!  The cast is fantastic and the story line is wonderful!  Actually many stories within the major plot.  A wonderful first movie,...what fun to see Ed Asner again.",1343433600,4,202,4.714285714285714
5130518,5,B0084CAU9C,"Loved it!  While most indie comedies are generally very quirky, they offer little substance.  What I liked most about Let Go is that it did something different - weaving together four different story lines to illuminate larger themes.  Really well done and wonderfully acted.  Ed Asner is as good as I have ever seen him and the rest of the cast is outstanding, particularly the comedian Kevin Hart who shines.  it's a real gem.  Definitely one of my favorite films of the year!",1339286400,5,478,4.698795180722891
8525030,5,B0084CAU9C,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to a bunch of the main characters (I'm an empath).  Really don't get all the low ratings I've seen for this film around the web as its legitimately one of the better entries in the indie ""dramedy"" genre.  Unless people watched this not being fans of the genre and not knowing it was this genre.  But then how did they find out about it?  I've loved this genre for years and only found out about this movie a few months ago.  Maybe they watched it for the cast and thought it would be more of a straight up, mainstream comedy?  But yeah, I really liked it.  All their struggles felt real and I wish one of the characters had gotten a better fate after all they'd been through (no spoilers which).  And maybe its just me, but Gillian Jacobs is pretty easy on the eyes :)  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494806400,,1861,4.458579881656805

8525034,1,B0084CAU9C,"The SLOW BORING story of 3 recent parolees and their parole officer. The story focuses on a miserable old man, a manipulative woman and a ex-doctor as they try to get their lives back together after getting out of jail. THIS MOVIE IS SO SLOW AND GOES NOWHERE!! Overall, its tone is depressing...which is fine..but not fine if the ending is suppose to be ""uplifting"" in some way or a relief. Because if it was, it failed big time. Where are the character arcs? All three parolee arcs are barely speed bumps. The story drags cuz there are too many repetitive scenes that don't MOVE THE STORY FORWARD!! This kills the pacing and the wait for something significant to happen (ANYTHING!!) is torturous. All four storylines end with a whimper as nothing really happens to any of them. LET GO? The story needs to show the characters REALLY holding on to something if they are to LET GO. The actors all seem to be sleepwalking through their performances. So why should I care what happens to them?

It's tough to root for any of these characters. A few of them...the doctor in particular, you feel sorry for...but the rest have very few redeemable qualities and after awhile you just really hope they either commit suicide or someone kills them. That would have at least perked the ACTION up a little and given a more substantial resolution to some of their stories. No one is ever in real jeopardy of anything happening to them...and there are no real tough obstacles for any of the characters to overcome or let go off to gain whatever fulfillment they're looking for...so where is the TENSION AND CONFLICT in this story? Some of the characters goals are not clear.

If all 4 are dealing with ""internal"" conflicts, the screenwriter and director did a terrible job building it up to have any kind of developing story. They all just walk back and forth and speak in monotones without much emotion even. If they don't care about their lives and struggles, why should I? You cannot tell a story WITHOUT ACTIVELY TELLING A STORY. There is nothing here for anyone to let go of....the doctor is suppose to still be in love with his ex-wife? I never really felt that. He passively bumps into her twice and he says nothing...that's it! The parole officer nearly has an affair but goes back to a marriage he doesn't seem to care about at any point in the movie. The miserable old man is suppose to be in love with this old lady but he only makes superficial attempts to be with her. He's pathetic. And the manipulative woman is suppose to be falling in love (for the 1st time) with the unobtainable parole officer...but all she does all film is stand around and look pretty. You never really get the feeling she REALLY WANTS him. The whole thing is like NEARLY a story. As if the writer wanted to tell four stories but didn't know how. It's very frustrating to watch this kind of ""nearly"" story...where nothing ever really happens and the ending is VERY UNSATISFYING.

It could have been a lot better...deeply emotional and heartbreaking with a very satisfying ending where all the characters LET GO of whatever it is that's stopping them from being happy...but in the end, the whole thing just comes across as so superficial that it's impossible to care.",1471219200,2,3239,4.629565217391304
