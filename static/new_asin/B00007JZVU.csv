7977062,5,B00007JZVU,This is a heartwarming look back at the legend Tennessee Ernie Ford. I remember seeing him on various variety shows in the '50s and '60s as I was growing up and my parents always had his records around the house. And that voice ... wow! When he sang a hymn you could feel the presence of God. I didn't know the character of this man until I watched this biography. His integrity and commitment to his wife and sons was as stellar as his talent. God bless you Ernie and THANK YOU for the years of clean jokes and powerful songs.,1360022400,,527,4.227722772277228

However, we would love to have some DVD's of the
shows he made - the complete shows.",1252800000,8,136,4.269230769230769
7977065,5,B00007JZVU,"I bought this primarily for the additional feature tennessee Ernie Ford: Amazing Grace, a program (which also aired on PBS) of excerpts from the Ford show with him and his back up group, the Top Twenty, singing over twenty hymns and spirituals.  Ford was as well known for his sacred recordings as he was for his secular music, and was perhaps the best bass baritone singer of gospel music during his lifetime (barring, of course, George Beverly Shea).  The main feature is a 35-40 minute biography of his life, and shows when he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame by the Oak Ridge boys, which I remember seeing on TV when it happened.  If you like listening to someone who can sing, I high recommend you buy this video.",1230854400,8,734,4.545454545454546
