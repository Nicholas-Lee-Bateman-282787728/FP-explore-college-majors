2183191,4,B0006GAOE0,"All Editorial Review Product Descriptions for RCE's red box discs are a c&p text that includes their ""100 greatest classic films of all time"" blurb. These mostly obscure works are hardly as advertised. Also, picture and sound quality depend on condition of unrestored source material. Good to fair is about average.

MY LOVE FOR YOURS is a public domainer that was theatrically titled, ""Honeymoon in Bali."" The picture's original  ""Are Husbands Necessary?"" name was jettisoned when leading lady Madeleine Carroll landed in divorce court.

""Bali"" is the sort of escapist light comedy that was most common during the Great Depression's earlier years. (F. Scott Fitzgerald is rumored to have contributed to the script.) It's the story of Gail Allen, an upscale career gal whose vow to never marry is sorely tried when Bill Burnett (MacMurray), a visitor to Manhattan from Bali, meets and falls in love with her.

When Bill's marriage proposal is rejected by Gail, he returns home. She soon regrets her hasty rejection and follows him halfway around the globe. Gail discovers to her dismay that Noel Van Ness (Massen), who'd been unsuccessfully pursuing Bill for some time, has finally gotten his wedding commitment, so she regretfully departs for New York, her 5th Avenue job and would-be fianc Eric Sinclair (Jones). As a rebounding Bill had done in Bali, Gail now does in New York. She agrees to marry Eric. Clearly, as the film's title suggests, this isn't where our story ends.

Besides a solid main cast, this one has an interesting company of uncredited players:

(6.6) Honeymoon in Bali (1939) - Fred MacMurray/Madeleine Carroll/Allan Jones/Akim Tamiroff/Helen Broderick/Osa Massen",1285459200,2,3436,7.056470588235294
2183192,5,B0006GAOE0,"This very warm and charming film is very special but not well known. Madeleine Carroll gives one of her best performances opposite Fred MacMurray, who also shines in this quietly affecting comedy-drama. A good screenplay from Virgina Van Upp based on stories by Grace Sartwell Mason and Katharine Brust, and some nice photography from Ted Tetzlaff, make this film very satisfying.

Edward H. Griffith directed this film which is surprisingly good, sneaking up on the viewer until you are fully engrossed in a story which has a very real and mature feel to it. Edith Head dressed the elegant Madeleine Carroll, and she was never lovelier than in ""Honeymoon in Bali,"" also known as ""My Love For Yours.""

Gail Allen (Madeleine Carroll) runs Morrissey's, an upscale department store. She has success and money and thinks she is happy with her life. Helen Broderick is her friend, Lorna Smith, a slightly older woman who writes novels of romance in far away places. Allan Jones is the Met star who is her friend and escort. When Gail gets an astrological reading talking about marriage to a tall man with a cut on his arm, that includes a child, she laughs it off. But when she happens upon Bill Barnett (Fred MacMurray) in a boat store, and he lives in Bali and just happens to have a cut on his arm, she begins to wonder.

While this may sound like the premise for a screwball type comedy, it is rather a warm and charming film with both humor and tenderness. The humor stems from Gail's unwillingness to give up a successful career simply for love, especially with someone beneath her station, whose only positive is he knows how to enjoy life. Osa Massen is quite good as the pretty girl from Bali, Noel, who likes to enjoy life as well and wants to share the fun with ""Willie,"" causing some wry and humorous complications.

Bill has in his charge a sweet little girl named Rosie (Carolyn Lee) who becomes attached to Gail, as does she to her. Gail takes Rosie on a boat trip to run from her feelings and finds a smiling and easygoing Bill waiting to meet them. Despite the wonderful time they have together, Gail keeps clinging to her life and success in the city rather than taking the plunge.

Eric (Allan Jones) is safe and devoted, and fits into her idea of marriage. It is Akim Tamiroff, however, as the wise old window washer, who makes her see that she is pushing away exactly the thing she needs in her life. But with Noel back in Bali with Bill, will it be too late?

This film is full of quiet but very real moments, some humorous and some tender. It has a warmth and sincerity which is quite pleasing. A nice atmosphere is created through the elements of rain and snow in the city and the sunshine of the tropics. It highlights the differences between what some consider success, and true happiness, and mirrors what Gail is torn between.

The entire cast is good in this little gem of a film many have not heard about. There is a light tone but a mature approach to everything that happens. The pace is easy but not slow, the story allowed to develop just as in real life. Classic film fans will surely appreciate this one. It is also a good family film, a scene where Gail shows little Rosie how to pray very sweet. There is some wry humor here and situations that will have you smiling a lot. All in all, this is a fine film and will be a real surprise if you haven't discovered it yet.",1136160000,7,3400,4.483037156704362
2183193,5,B0006GAOE0,"I ordered this DVD from one of the Amazon Marketplace sellers -- it had two movies on the same disk (""Double Feature""), from Dollar Entertainment in a keep case: The Amazing Adventure (1936, British, originally titled The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss, 63 min., Maltin's Movie Guide shows 70 min., IMDb shows 80 min. UK and USA: 61 min.),  with Cary Grant - filmed in England, and My Love For Yours (1939) (USA - video title), a.k.a. Honeymoon in Bali, Are Husbands Necessary? (USA) (working title) Husbands or Lovers (UK) 95 minutes, with Fred MacMurray, Madeleine Carroll, Allan Jones (what a set of tonsils on that man), Akim Tamiroff, among other really good actors, and the really sweet Caroline Lee.  It was extremely well written and timely even by today's standards.  (SPOILER: ""I'm not a feminist...,"" says the main character, who owns her own large department store).  There are reviews for this movie under it's own title -- a good family movie in general except for a scene where Fred MacMurray pushes Madeleine Carroll down--might bother younger viewers.  My Love for Yours was a pristine print, I must say.  The Amazing Adventure was a good movie that I had also not seen before, but apparently the master was in really poor condition in that it had streaks and glitches, breaks in the film (sentences not finished) but clear images and still enjoyable.  I recommend both movies.",1120262400,3,1393,4.877118644067797

It is a great old movie. Very happy with it.

Alternately titled as ""Honeymoon in Bali"" the film is a bit scratchy but this is an utterly charming comedy about an (ahead of her time) executive beauty (Madeleine Carroll)and the dapper guy who comes along,complete with a precocious orphan, to upset her plans and make her rethink her well-ordered life. This is a sweet romantic comedy that will have me singing ""Mama don't want no peas, no rice, no coconut oil"" for quite some time.",1383091200,,491,4.72093023255814
2183200,3,B0006GAOE0,"AKA  ""Honeymoon in Bali"", and ""Are Husbands Necessary"", was released 29 September 1939.
Description from IM.DB:
""Bill Burnett, a resident of Bali, visits New York City, meets and falls in love with Gail Allen, the successful manager of a Fifth Avenue shop, who is determined to remain free and independent. Bill proposes, Gail declines and Bill goes home to Bali. But a young girl, Rosie, and Tony the Window Cleaner, who dispels advice on every floor, soon have Gail thinking maybe she was a bit hasty with her no to Bill's proposal. Ere long she discovers that she does love Bill and can't live without him. She goes down to Bali to give him the good news. He learns that he is soon to marry Noel Van Ness. She goes back to New York City. Written by Les Adams <longhorn1939@suddenlink.net>""

It's a cheesy but likable film.  The writing is, to put it nicely, very laid back.  Ossa Massen looks amazing in this.  All in all, it's the kind of film to have running in the background while you're multi tasking, like music.",1381017600,,1021,4.587912087912088
2183201,2,B0006GAOE0,"My Love For Yours is one of those old movies with a heroine, who lives in a fabulous NYC apartment, has good friends and a great job and has deluded herself into believing she's happy.

Even though I'm a feminist through and through, I'm as open to this kind of story as anybody. But here's the thing. The guy has to be amazing (Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck), the woman has  to be a  convincing career woman (Vivien Leigh, Katherine Hepburn, Lauren Bacall) and the hero has to respect the heroine.

In this movie, Fred MacMurray, handsome though he was, is wasted. His character shows a bit of wit, but seems mostly shallow, and bent on telling the heroine that she's not a real woman. He's irritating, not irresistible. The character  of the heroine is not convincing. There's no clue as to how she managed to become the big boss in a world where most women are secretaries.  The MacMurray character shows very little respect for the heroine. From the start he's telling her how rigid and lonely she is, when in fact, she seems happy and successful. He doesn't seem to be a guy bowled over with love, as he can't wait to change her.  MacMurray reminded me  of the failed suitors in Tracy and Hepburn movies (Gig Young in Desk Set) whom  Spencer Tracy used to dispose of with a few well placed wisecracks.

These two did deserve each other. He was shallow. She was insecure and not too bright. I'm not surprised the movie is buried, as even in the 30s and 40s two annoying people are not what viewers look for in a romance.",1381017600,,1535,4.469534050179211
2183202,5,B0006GAOE0,"I've watched this movie several times. It's funny and heartwarming. The little girl in the film is wonderful, and if you love old movies, you're sure to enjoy this one.",1381017600,,168,4.633333333333334
2183203,4,B0006GAOE0,"A cute movie.  Nice fluffy story about a young beautiful business executive, who, despite ""not being a feminist"", has decided not to ever fall in love nor marry since she wants to keep her freedom and not be tied down with cares and responsibilities.  After the proverbial rocky road, there's a happy ending.  (at least, maybe a feminist would not consider it a happy ending, but I do).  There's actually some morality in it, too.  Heroine teaches little orphan Rosie to pray.  Priest teaches Fred MacMurray that marriage is a ""mystery"", a lifetime bond between one man and one woman.  Refreshing! The window washer is a chuckle, too.",1377388800,,634,4.814814814814815

8041491,3,B0006GAOE0,"Escapist colonial/big city movie that I think had a couple of brilliant line contributions/cinematic elements and a very beautiful hat and fun sail boat scene and an offbeat and non-rhythmic little girl.  The little girl summed it up.  It had a bunch of elements thrown together, some enjoyable.  It was charming and racist, which is the con.  I don't totally agree with one review about lead not showing ability to be the general manager.  She worked long hours, but I did think it interesting she was doing the window dressing late at night.  So maybe in perspective they did have a point.  There wasn't a lot of interaction between her and the store employees, that is true, like the female lead in Miracle on 34th Street.  I think I would have preferred the sequel to after they were married and her world broadened and they went through the war together, how their marriage would have lasted.  Now that would be a movie.  South Pacific anyone?
Pros:
Window washer perspective at start and end
A few brilliant lines and innuendos
The sailboat scene
Beautiful hats
The song and little girl singing out of rhythm with the leads
Fred MacMurray prompting the little girl about the end of the movie to stop singing...
The fortune teller was fun
Eric's singing
Cons:
Racism
How the housekeeper spoke to Fred MacMurray
Eric's prolonged opera in the middle
Noel was irritating.

Recommended for:  anyone",1400025600,,1399,4.807531380753138
