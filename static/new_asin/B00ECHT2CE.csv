I grew up with a psychopath and, my psychopath pulled a lot of the same manipulation trick and games as Noogie did in the movie, with the same disastrous results to a lot of people!
'Drinking Games' is a movie much like, 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.' Both movies are educational and thought provoking.  'Drinking Games' deals with a very, very, dark and evil nature of a type of people who have no conscience whatsoever; you will never ever be able to appeal to their ""better nature""... they don't have one!  This is a great movie if you can quite living in denial, and deal with how many of these 'human monster's we all have to deal with in our daily lives. 'Drinking Games' is the stuff of night terrors and PTSD.",1416355200,2,823,4.443708609271523
