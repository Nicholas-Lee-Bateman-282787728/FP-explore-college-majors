5000483,5,B006K49O0M,"Oscar Romero is a man whose life makes him a saint even if the Catholic Church won't make it official.  Here is a man of valor who was not afraid to change his mind and even his way of life to proclaim TRUTH.  The many words he used in his homilies and declarations paled in comparison to the life he lived proving his commitment to those words and to the teachings of Jesus Christ.  To christian and non-Christian alike he stands out as a man of integrity on the correct side of the issues of life.  He gave his life on behalf of the theory that the Church has a preferential option for the poor.  He gave his life because he had a preferential option for the poor and the marginalized and the oppressed, especially those who were unjustly oppressed.  ""Monseor"" captures the true Romero!  It is a ""must see"" for everyone who proclaims and believes in true peace obtained by true justice.",1334620800,16,888,4.411042944785276
5000484,5,B006K49O0M,"""The film is intended to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of Oscar Romero's death: a documentary, Monseor: The Last Journey of scar Romero, directed by Ana Carrigan and Juliet Weber.

The film is, unintentionally perhaps, or at least effortlessly, a hagiography, a record of a saintly life. It is an astonishing compilation of footage from the last three years of Romero's life, not only of the archbishop himself but of army patrols and mothers of the disappeared and guerrillas on the move--and above all of those unforgettable Masses in which the small, unprepossessing archbishop read out loud the record of the government's atrocities while hundreds of ragged, persecuted campesinos listened in gratitude, their existence and suffering recognized at last.""

5000485,5,B006K49O0M,"Excellent documentary with footage from the civil war and interviews with people who lived through it and knew Archbishop Romero.
Disturbing at times. This is my second purchase of this film- I gave away my last copy.",1426723200,,217,4.891891891891892
5000486,5,B006K49O0M,"""Monsenor: The Last Journey of Oscar Romero"" is an extraordinary documentary!  I thought the Hollywood film ""Romero"" was reasonably well done, but it can't hold a candle to the wonderful presentation of solid content this documentary delivers.  Through Romero's transformation from a meek introverted bookworm priest, to a truly compassionate pastoral leader as the Archbishop of San Salvador, the documentary tell the story of an entire country, perhaps a continent. This film provides an ""on the ground"" perspective of the brutal repression that confronted El Salvadoran democracy.  I only wish it would have attempted to explore the geopolitical structures that produce and sustain the repression more deeply.  I suspect that relatively few North Americans are aware of the repression that Central and South American people continue to endure.  Even fewer are aware that it is largely the result of anti-democratic governments fomented and sustained by U.S. foreign policy.  Beginning with the Theodore Roosevelt administration, it radically expanded during the cold war, and remains intact to this day.  All-in-all, this is an important record of a human life following the pattern of Jesus most extraordinarily.  It is a true story of a hero's transformational faithfulness to love in the face of evil, even unto death.  It is a powerful story of a saint who's life testifies to immense human dignity.",1424217600,7,1406,5.383561643835616
5000487,5,B006K49O0M,A great video. There were some scenes that were new for me. I have watched it multiple times and have shared it too!,1420934400,,116,4.086956521739131
5000488,5,B006K49O0M,"I was one of the advisors to the Salvadoran armed force during the time period in the movie and thereafter.  I've got my own reservations as to who or why Monsenor Romero was killed (see my book, ""Relfections Behnd the Retina"").  The presentation makes for an in-depth study of the Salvadoran people of the time and their feelings.  The Salvadoran  military unit patch that I was mostly associated with (CITFA) is the only patch clearly seen and it did bring back memories.  I would definately recommend it as required reading for anyone interested in the Salavdoran civil war.

5000489,5,B006K49O0M,"This powerful documentary should be shown in every church and Christian school in the United States. Monsenor Romero experienced a conversion during his ministry as Archbishop of El Salvador; this transformation led him to live a life of faith that does justice and eventually cost him his life.

5000493,5,B006K49O0M,"This documentary is very well done and compelling. I have watched the fictionalized ""Romero"", with Raul Julia, many times. This documentary shows more of the interaction between Romero and the people, and better shows the conditions of the people's lives and oppression. The amount of actual footage of Romero is very impressive, and really helps the viewer connect with the man. I would recommend this film to those who are interested in Latin American culture and/or history, or a look at the Catholic Church's Liberation Theology as applied in the past.",1397692800,,556,5.1208791208791204
5000494,5,B006K49O0M,"One of the most spiritually profound and moving films to come along in ages, MONSENOR: THE LAST JOURNEY OF OSCAR ROMERO is a low-key but cumulatively powerful documentary. It is a long overdue examination of one of the 20th-Centurys most significant and possibly most overlooked Christian martyrs, Monsenor Oscar Romero of El Salvador.

Standing up alongside Gandhi as an exemplary example of passive resistance to injustice, Romeros legacy in El Salvador continues to this day.

Filmmakers Ana Carrigan and Juliet Weber have created a heart-felt, moving, deeply personal yet somehow also objective portrait of a man whose principles and beliefs they clearly admire. Numerous interviews with Romero followers are enough to persuade the viewer that their subject was truly an inspiration. Hearing excerpts from his own recorded diary further cements this impression, thereby adding to the sense of outrage many felt at his murder by the corrupt Revolutionary Government Junta. How, for example, could anyone live their life on a daily basis serving others with humility, selflessness and caring when they are fully aware that their own life is in constant peril? Oscar Romero was such a man.

In El Salvador in the 1970s, assassination, along with disappearances, torture and terrorism, was the norm. The fact that Oscar Romero knew it was only a matter of time before he was killed serves to illustrate his deep commitment to his people through the Liberation Theology he preached so powerfully. He surely knew his actions could have only one outcome in a country so politically committed to subduing and exploiting its citizenry. There is a reason why Romero is currently under consideration for Sainthood by the Catholic Church.

The political implications in this film are not pleasant to consider. Romero was critical of the United States support for the military government. President Carter ignored Romeros written entreaties that the U.S. cease their support of the corrupt government. Just how much of a hand did the United States have in Romeros death? This question isn't asked but it is clearly implied. Its a sobering thought.

In 1989 Raul Julia starred in a biographical film depicting Archbishop Romeros life and death. Though a fine subject for dramatized biography, this outstanding documentary reminds the viewer that there is nothing more powerful than the real thing.

Romeros life and martyrdom are an inspiration. Thankfully, so is this documentary.",1397433600,,2471,5.290816326530612
5000495,5,B006K49O0M,"Very Good, But Quite sad about the outcome. And, as the saying goes, Evil Triumphs when Good Men Do Nothing, but... here a Good Man was trying to do Good & as he continued doing Good, his life was sacrificed by Assassination as happens too often.

Excellent footage showing Oscar Romero prior to his death - interviews with people who knew him and worked with him.

The film is very moving - I was brought to tears a couple of times as people spoke of how he fought for them and helped them.

Not a happy film, but truly an INSPIRATIONAL one. Well-suited for audiences who read English well - probably 16 years and older.",1347062400,14,481,4.382022471910112

That is what I feel from him. It is my understanding there are many Saints not made such by the Church Militant.  Although, I would not be suprised at all if Saint Monsenor Romero is beatified.  Named Saints through the Church Militant still here on Earth are named such as examples for those still on Earth to live by.  It does not mean they are the only Saints, contrary there are many more ""unamed"".  Some may prefer it that way because of humility etc.",1336780800,3,610,4.243478260869566
