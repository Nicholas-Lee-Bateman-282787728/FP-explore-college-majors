7802940,4,6300135748,"I have to preface this review by saying that the used tape I watched was in terrible shape and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to watch the whole movie.  However, I persevered and was able to appreciate another Werner Herzog piece of brilliance.  The premise (based, I believe, on a true story) is the discovery of an adult male in the early 1800's who had grown up without contact from the outside world.  The greatness of the movie is in exploring society through the eyes of someone who had not been ingrained with the core beliefs of the time and culture.  Herzog gives us some great examples of hypocracy and self-assurance through the eyes and ears of our hero.  Herzog's efforts are all the better by the relative subtlety with which he makes his point.  There are many good scenes but my favorite one was where a learned man (I think he was a minister) challenges our hero to discern the one question that would enable him to tell which of two person was the one who couldn't tell the truth and which was the one who couldn't lie.  There was a system of geometric logic that his interregator was working with.  However, our hero comes up with the better question; ""I would ask him if he is a tree-frog"".  It was an example of how people were always testing this young man.  In the end we realized that he passed the test but the rest of society failed.  I might have rated it 5 stars if I had been able to watch a better version.",1195430400,,1442,4.303703703703704
