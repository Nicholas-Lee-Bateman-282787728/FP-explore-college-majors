8274736,5,B0019MVSE0,"I love both of these films they are light and airy great for a rainy day or just to stay in a cuddle too... Housesitter will keep you smiling and laughing it is a very cute movie, I love the way Goldie just barges in to his life without him knowing and every one falls in love with her... Even him LOL...

Roxanne is a great film as well it is funny through out, I love when he falls out of the tree and tell the elderly women that space aliens want to have sex with them and they go running off in search for the aliens...

I give both of these movies two thumbs up... You gotta be in the mood for a clean good time to watch them...",1232236800,,633,3.8615384615384616
