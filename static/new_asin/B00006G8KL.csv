8213278,2,B00006G8KL,"This should not be called backyard wrestling.  Instead it should be called backyard weapon fights.  Hardly any of these matches use actual wrestling just striking with weapons.  There are some, well actually only about 3 or 4 of the ""matches"" that showcase actual wrestling.  Im talking about anything with the guys Kaos and M Dogg 20 in it.",1145318400,,341,4.827586206896552
8213279,3,B00006G8KL,"This is a silly DVD for silly people. It just shows people imitating hardcore wrestling and doing silly shxt. It would be better if it showed matches in their entirety. The only reason I brought this DVD is becuase it showed some naked hoez on the cover. But there are no women getting naked in this DVD! The best part of this DVD was the previews-the only place where you see nudity. The Backyard Babes preview was pretty good since it was uncensored. It also had uncensored previews to World's Wildest Bachelor parties and Spring Breaks. Actually, I spent more time watching the previews than the feature! So if you decide to buy this, just watch the previews and forget the rest.",1104105600,2,682,4.598360655737705
8213280,5,B00006G8KL,"This volume lives up to its name. It has some of the most extreme matches that you will see in the series. There are matches that involve drills, more lightbulbs, more thumbtacs, and more flames. This is possible the best of the series, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone.",1055116800,,281,4.529411764705882
