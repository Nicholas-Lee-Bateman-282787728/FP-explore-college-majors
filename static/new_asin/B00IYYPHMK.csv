8646692,1,B00IYYPHMK,"The show could have been good, but it drops the ball everywhere from casting to scripting. It lasted one season. On the surface, Taxi Brooklyn is a serious crime drama. But look at the premise: the star cop isn't allowed to drive so she utilizes a French speaking taxi driver she arrested in the first episode.

Chyler Leigh (Cat) and Jacky Ido (Leo) are interesting, but not correctly casted. It is difficult to believe she's a real cop or that he has the past he claims.

Cat (the cop) has a high maintenance mom who misses her late husband (also a cop) and men in general.

Leo (the taxi driver) is a womanizer who did time in prison.

Leo's roommate is Ronnie is stereotypical gay man apparently written in as comedic relief. He's high-strung, effeminate, all about fashion, and willing to tell people he barely knows they need a makeover.

Cat's Catholic upbringing is highlight when she cites chapter and verse for a rather uncommonly discussed passage in the Book of Zechariah. A typical Catholic person would not know this, even if they went through the Catholic school system. In the same episode, she claims to be a recovering Catholic while every other religion is insulted as well (Jews, Muslims, Zoroastrians, and religion in general).

All the cops are treated as street smart but intellectually dumb.

Potshots are taken at Americans, Brits and French, all under the guise of character development.

Strangely, the show's writers have taken an intriguing concept and insulted all of them. For once, the Catholic and gay community should both feel an affront from Hollywood.

Meanwhile, the plausibility of a random taxi driver with a record as a felon would be quickly accepted as a paid consultant is nil. If the show was otherwise better, it might be easier to suspend belief and just flow with it. Unfortunately, the show was poorly planned and written, and no surprisingly, was cancelled.

A couple redeeming points exist. Leo clearly loves his son (the mother apparently has complete custody). Cat seems to love her mom.

8646693,3,B00IYYPHMK,"I must admit, this is a very clever idea. Unfortunately they didn't play it very well.

Here's the scoop. Brooklyn detective Caitlyn Sullivan (Chyler Leigh) is chasing down a cab after a bank robbery. She arrests the cabbie figuring him as the getaway driver. The driver Leo Romba (Jacky Ido) is a black Frenchman. Since she has wrecked yet another department car in the chase, she is forbidden to drive. He offers his services to help prove his innocence and actually becomes helpful in solving the bank heist and other related heists.

This is a cool idea but it fails on a couple of levels. One is the lead Chyler Leigh. She doesn't own the role. I didn't believe her, and her attempts to act tough fell short. It didn't help that her dialogue (and the dialogue for everyone else for that matter) was lackluster to say the least. One of the cool things about cop movie/TV dialogue is the snap. Nowhere to be found here. hen there was the pilot storyline. At a 44 minute running time they felt they had to wrap it up way too quickly. It threw the rhythm off. I like Leo the cabbie. He has a natural presence in front of the camera and an ease to his delivery.

There's a secondary plot of her trying to find the killer(s) of her detective father. It smacks of corruption and she performs the investigation against the orders of her boss. Another sub-plot is her relationship with her ex-FBI-husband. This is all well and good but they laid it out too quickly and nothing rings with any authenticity.

It seems this made it an entire season but I see no season 2 on the horizon so.......",1432944000,,1588,4.4655172413793105
