In order to watch it, I would have had to buy a panasonic DVD player and then get it converted to the USA zone.  It was going to cost too much money, so unfortunately I didn't watch it.",1427068800,,319,3.8181818181818183
8088929,5,B000BMCY6K,"I'm a student studying dermatology and I was looking around online for something that would be helpful during school, something in addition to the normal books we get.

This explained microdermabrasion techniques really well, step by step. I learn from school, go home, and put some notes down in the guide which helps me glue everything in my mind together.

Learning about the aluminum oxide crystals was also very fun!

I'd recommend this to any learning dermatologist. c:",1418947200,,475,5.064102564102564

8088932,3,B000BMCY6K,"The teaching topics are not well connected, i.e. Discuss about one topic then jump to a practice that not in sequences.  The CD is in very poor quality, can not watch the entire video.  The manufacturer needs to review on quality, very poor and defective CD.  Disappointment!",1336003200,,275,4.808510638297872
