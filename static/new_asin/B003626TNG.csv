4071967,5,B003626TNG,"I thought this movie was being released because another movie similar in nature is being released this week called Kick Ass.  I am guessing this is probably the reason.  Regardless, this movie was really good.  It was one of those movies going into thinking it was going to be a straight comedy and it wasnt.  The acting was really good, the characters are good and if you want to see an interesting take on the superhero scene check it out.",1271203200,,441,4.475
4071968,5,B003626TNG,"While marketed as a comedy, Defendor is actually a dark and touching crime drama.  But while you can't expect Woody's comedy antics a la Zombieland, expect one of the best performances of his career.

By day, Arthur Poppington is a construction worker with a below-average IQ.  By night, he's Defendor, dishing out justice with makeshift weapons (reminding us in his gruff Batman voice that ""guns are for cowards"").  But while the movie starts out light and funny, it evolves into something both dark and sad.  With the flood of recent superhero movies, Defendor reminds us that reality isn't always so super.

The real story here is the unlikely friendship between Defendor and a drug-addicted prostitute, in his ongoing mission to take down Captain Industry.  Woody is terrific in the role, bouncing between his wacky self and a vulnerable man-child who still believes in justice.

For this being his first directing gig, Peter Stebbings hits a bullseye.  There's great cinematography and lighting, and Stebbings playfully throws out a few superhero flick cliches.  John Rowley serves up one of the best movie scores I've heard in a while, with a powerful and dark superhero soundtrack.  The supporting cast is also top-notch, from Elias Koteas and Sandra Oh to Clark Johnson (The Wire/Homicide).

You will enjoy this movie if you go into it with the understanding that it's not a comedy.  It's a dark drama with splashes of humor and violence, and a very powerful ending.",1270252800,39,1474,5.016460905349795
4071969,5,B003626TNG,"When I saw the previews of this I thought it would be a formulaic comedy, with Woody Harrelson playing a jerk.
I was surprised to find the previews misleading, and Woody's character is actually mildly retarded, and somewhat delusional.  It has its moments of humor, but none of it is cruel.  Arthur is slow and believes he's a super hero, but no one makes fun of him.  In fact they're all somewhat in awe of him and his misguided beliefs in absolute good and evil.  It is poignant and actually has some tear jerk moments, along with its moments of almost slapstick humor.
Bottom line - see it.",1269129600,28,593,4.462962962962963

4071974,5,B003626TNG,"Highly recommend this movie.
Skeptical? Rent it, like I did.
You'll be back over to buy it.
Promise.

I've been fairly obsessed with Woody Harrelson's low key cult movies for many years. This movie and one other, (Bunraku) stand out as gems.

It's incredibly brilliant dark humor will keep you floating in between tears and laughter from beginning to end. It'll make you love humans again. It'll make you hate humans again. It'll make you question morality. It will make you understand.
It's clever, crazy and allows Woody to show off his serious acting chops.
Props.

I won't totally give the movie away, but I will say that it makes me want to write you a novel (that would totally give it all away.)",1490400000,,702,4.645161290322581

4071994,4,B003626TNG,"""Defendor"" gives us another take on the small ""superhero in the real world"" genre. Woody Harrelson's ""Defendor"" is a bit more Slingblade than Kick-Ass or the Crimson Bolt (""Super,"" 2010). He definitely has issues; more ADHD than ""dumb,"" with other psychological problems to boot.

The film sports a strong cast, culled from Hollywood's underused supporting characters (Kat Dennings, Elias Koteas, Sandra Oh). Whereas ""Super's"" protagonist had a clear mission, and Kick-Ass tethered himself to Big Daddy's and Hit Girl's goals, ""Defendor"" takes a different direction, with a virtuous hero of pure motives. One could cast this as a modern version of Don Quixote, particularly in Defendor's chivalrous approach to drug-addicted prostitute Angel (Kat Dennings).

""Defendor"" bears some resemblance to the aforementioned ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Super."" However, it's an original take. Defendor may use a World War I trench club, but his jars of wasps and other tricks remain rooted in the PG realm of comics. Conversely, protagonists ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Super"" take violence to extremes. One may question whether Defendor engages in half-measures, or whether he is so influenced by the eternal recurrence of the same conflicts that he refuses to apply the obvious finalities. (His trench club appears to be of the 18-inch variety; these typically were studded with hobnails, and the center was bored out and replaced with a lead plug. You can even see an iron band at the end, employed in some models to keep the wood from splintering from repeated use or striking helmets. Trench raiding clubs were close-quarters skull crushers, nothing more.)

Two other items that make this genre standout: Comic books actually exist, and the persona elevates a nobody to heroic status. For instance, zombie films typically pretend zombie films and other media don't exist. Zombies are never called zombies; a silly convention. The use of persona is important, and flips the comic paradigm. In comics, people with powers and honed abilities pretend to be nullities. In the genre of ""real world hero,"" nullities elevate themselves with a persona. In some instances, they gain actual abilities. Defendor is a mixed bag; Harrelson's character is on a mission, but the persona seems to be crucial to focusing him. He shows a mix of extreme prowess and high incompetence, at alternating intervals.

His nemesis is ""Captain Industry,"" something I won't spoil but who serves as an abstraction that becomes flesh. This pursuit, this ""tilt at windmills"" is critical to the plot.

Much of the characterization, for once, occurs through actions and through other characters' observations of Defendor. It's not lazy and exposition heavy. Be thankful for independent films.

There's action and empathy. Harrelson is great at playing the mix of a vulnerable and damaged man employed at the fringes of the construction industry. His Defendor persona allows him to slip into a SWAT-like uniform and face paint, though with aged analog recording equipment and a sadder duct taped ""D"" on his chest. Maybe there's enough evil in the world to allow someone motivated by injustice to find their ""Captain Industry.""

How far can a man push his delusions if others find inspiration in them? At that point, are they actually delusions? Or would we greet someone who is morally perfect as insane in an ambiguous and expedient world? There's something to think about here. I found my enjoyment of the film increasing in the hours and days after I watched it.",1482105600,,3501,5.196808510638298
4071995,3,B003626TNG,"Defendor is more along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griff-the-Invisible/dp/B005G7WGG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griff the Invisible</a>&nbsp;than Kick Ass.  Basically Woody Harrison plays an intellectually disabled man who dresses up as a superhero beating up criminals (or unsuccessfully trying to) in his quest to find Captain Industry who someone told him when he was a kid was responsible for killing his mother.  After intervening when an undercover cop tries to get a prostitute (Kat Dennings from Two Broke Girls) to perform an act on him without his using protection, Defendor attracts the attention of the police.  He also is now the target of vengeance for the corrupt cop, and an easy mark for money and a place to stay for the prostitute.  It's a predictable movie, it's more a mild drama than a comedy, but enjoyable enough.",1477958400,,897,5.7727272727272725
4071996,2,B003626TNG,"The trailer makes this film appear like it's a farce. I expected Woody Harrelson to play the typical ""idiot man-child,"" turned bumbling superhero. Nope! Harrelson's character is mentally disabled and a victim of childhood abuse and neglect, you know, happy, fun, stuff! Also Sex Trafficking!

The film is too long, has too many plot threads and too many characters. Nevertheless, this film has great acting from Harrelson, Elias Koteas, and Kat Dennings (who, if you've only seen her on 2 Broke Girls, you'll be surprised to find out she's an amazing actor).

Dennings plays the character ""Kat."" Yes, the character has the same name as the actress. Dennings is burdened with a script that has her play ""Kat"" as many characters in one. She's the worst kind of scumbag criminal, the prostitute with a heart of gold/coal, the damsel in distress, the kick-ass ""don't-need-no-man"" woman, the hopeless drug addict, and finally the poster child for addiction recovery.

Koteas, fresh of of the heals of the hit 1990 film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, channels DeNiro in the tough-guy heavy he was born to play. It's just too bad it's in this movie. He is alternating terrifying and sympathetic. Hes a misogynist killer and slaver, but also a drug addict, trapped in his role as enforcer by his previous crimes.

The problem with this film is it seems to have an identity problem. Is it a superhero parody film? A gritty crime drama about human trafficking? Is it an indictment of the treatment of the mental disabled? It smells like a little too much indie, with a way too much budget for the original vision. I like to believe this started out as a good film, and it got ""noted"" to death by executives and producers seeking a ""wider appeal.""",1474156800,,1736,4.815436241610739

4072045,5,B003626TNG,"This movie exceeded my expectations in every way, except for it being a comedy.  It's not funny at all and shouldn't have been marketed as a comedy.  (This is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.)  Otherwise, it's a great crime drama with a powerful ending.  Hollywood missed the boat by not picking it up to do a wide release on this film.  If you are a fan of the Superhero genre, you won't be disappointed.

Update 2 years later:
Having recommended this movie to many people since I've first watched it and subsequent multiple viewings, I had to bump my original review up to 5 stars.  The first time I saw it, I was distracted from my anticipation of waiting for the comedy to begin, which never happened.  Eventually, I realized that it wasn't even a dark comedy, it was just dark.  At that point, I was able to enjoy it.  However, I was disappointed that I didn't get the laughs I was looking for.  Revisiting the film knowing that it is actually a gritty crime drama, I was able to really enjoy it without the expectations of laughter.  This made me appreciate it even more.

A lot of other reviews say that this is a dark comedy, but I disagree because dark comedies still make you laugh.  Even if the dark comedy accomplishes this in the ""that is just wrong"" and ""I am ashamed at myself for laughing"" kind of way.  The concepts in this movie that are supposed to be funny make too much sense to be laughed at within the context of the world these characters live in.  Sure lemon juice in the eyes and Defendor's other crime fighting tools are humorous ideas suitable for a slapstick cartoon, but they are presented here as incredibly resourceful solutions for this otherwise challenged individual.  Instead, these elements come across as the few lighthearted moments in a movie that is a tragedy through and through.  It's nice to see that Amazon updated their description of the film to compare it to the likes of Taxi Driver verses some actual comedies.

All of this has made me rethink that superhero genre fans will enjoy it.  Those looking for traditional superhero fare could actually be disappointed just as folks looking for typical comedic yucks will be disappointed.  (I highly recommend ""Super"" for those that fall into either of those categories.  Also, the more nostalgic fan may want to check out ""Hero at Large."")  But superhero fans looking for an alternate take on ""real life"" superheros will be entertained by Defendor; just know that it's a drama.

It's rare that I enjoy something even more than I expected when I've been mislead.  This movie is one of those exceptions.  The bottom line: this is a fantastic movie.",1365465600,3,2643,4.605995717344753

4072053,5,B003626TNG,"I ordered a number of films with Sandra Oh, about whom there is something special, assuming this would be the lightest, the weakest of the lot; comic book stuff. And hoping it wouldn't be another in which Sandra Oh is relegated to small bit part.

The first surprise is that Woody Harrelson can act -- and gives a sympathetic, gritty performance in a difficult role: that of a person who has mental ""limitations"" but is a good person who means well.

The second surprise is that it isn't a comedy -- and if one connects with it emotionally, there is no ""comedy"" in it except if one considers the haplessness of a slightly retarded person ""funny"". This is a good drama which transcends its clichs (the hooker with a heart of gold; cops who can't be trusted) and compels one to think.

And, finally, a film with Sandra Oh that doesn't relegate her to mere bit part. In the extras, she comments that her job as an actress is to _listen_ to the other actor. In the film, as a psychiatrist, one sees her fulfilling her role doing exactly that which is required of it: _listening_ to the other person (Harrelson's character Arthur Poppington).

At one point she says to Arthur that he is a good person (and yet she recognizes he has ""limitations""). As he responds she communicates, with facial expression alone, that she -- rather, her character -- is emotionally moved by Harrelson's -- rather, his character's plight: a potential public danger because of his limitations, but a person not belonging behind bars. She communicates genuine compassion.

A terrific film that deserves more than one viewing, especially for the performances of Harrelson and the terrific Sandra Oh.",1338163200,4,1671,4.768166089965398
4072054,4,B003626TNG,"When this movie came out there were comparisons to Kick Ass. Then it got lost in the shuffle with Super. This is not a comedy, though there are a few nice moments. This is not a movie you can put into any real category. There are real emotional moments - over the top acting by some of the peripheral players - and more than a few disjointed scenes. But it is all completely watchable thanks to Woody Harrelson. Some day people will look back on his movies and realize that he is a movie star. When he is on screen you watch. And that is why you need to see this movie. He plays the main character as a real person. There is no wink at the camera. This is a man who truly believes he is fighting the good fight. He truly believes he is going to avenge his mother's death. Harrelson's character has a great supportive friend and family to turn to but decides to keep them safe by taking on ""Captain Industry"" by himself.
This is not a perfect movie, but it also should not be overlooked. Just go into it knowing it is not a dark comedy. It is not perfect, but Harrelson created a character that stuck with me, and I think it will stick with many of you as well.

This is an interesting film with a more or less realisitic approach to its subject; being a ""super hero"". Good performances by the cast help bring together the movie in a way that allows yourself to care for them as individuals. However this film is not so outstanding that I can hold your attention the entire way through. I found myself pausing it at certain points to go about other things I needed to do, however I was always pleased to come back and watch it as well. Arthur, played by Woody Harrelson, is a somewhat simple minded man who's biggest crime is caring about others. While is a way he is seeking revenge it never seems like it is mean spirited, merely justified. Not so much an action piece as Kick-Ass, or even a dark or real super hero movie, this is more of a character study of the good will of certain people. Woody Harrelson's performance is the best part of the film and is quite believable. Defendor is an interesting movie, that may make you reflect on certain parts of your own life or opinions, and is very well acted.

4072058,4,B003626TNG,"It seems today that real life heroes are hard to find. At least when it comes to ordinary everyday citizens. But the rare occasion does yield some true heroes which never seem to garner enough attention from the press. But what if heroes did exist? Not you next door neighbor type hero but an honest to goodness, costumed wearing hero? The answer is revealed in this week's release DEFENDOR.

Woody Harrelson plays Arthur Poppington, a mentally deficient man who considers himself the protector of his city. In search of his arch nemesis, Captain Industry, Arthur takes on the guise of Defendor, a costumed hero wearing black pants and a turtleneck with a large D made of duct tape on his chest. With home made weapons that include marbles and a truncheon he got from his grandfather, Defendor takes to the streets, video taping his exploits and saving the innocent.

Defendor's first innocent victim is Kat Debrofkowitz (Kat Denning), a young prostitute being worked on the street by Chuck Dooney (Elias Koteas), a dirty cop if there ever was one. Defendor gets the drop on Dooney and bashes him pretty good while ""saving"" Kat from him. She ends up coming back to Defendor's home, the storage facility for the city's street crew, bringing her crack pipe in search of a place to crash a few days.

As Kat and Arthur begin to get to know one another, Kat plays him along, feeding him the information that he wants. When he talks of Captain Industry, Kat tells him she knows who he is and can help Defendor find him. The problem is that the man she's setting Defendor up to go after is an actual bad guy, an importer of girls, guns and drugs. While Captain Industry might be a character in Arthur's mind, Kristic (Alan C. Peterson) is an actual killer and in taking him on, Defendor will definitely get more than he bargained for.

Along the way Defendor gets beat down by a group of bad guys working for Dooney which leads us to meet his ""family"".  Paul Carter (Michael Kelly) is Arthur's supervisor and friend. It was Arthur that saved Paul's son from an accident involving a car. Since then, Paul and his family have adopted Arthur to an extent. After the beating, Paul tries to persuade Arthur to give up Defendor and to come live with him.

Criminals don't tend to forgive and forget though. While Arthur is healing, they've decided that he may have heard or seen something and to take him out of the picture. At the same time and undercover policeman is working the case to put these guys in jail. The chances of their paths all colliding somewhere down the line increase with each minute you watch.

This movie works on so many levels. It works as a hero film with the costumed good guy taking on the bad guys. It works on a different level as the story of a mentally disabled man making his way in the world the best way he knows how, trying to do good where others turn away. And it works as a savior film where we have Arthur/Defendor doing all he can to save Kat from her current fate.

The stand out performance here is Woody Harrelson. As Michael Kelly says in the DVD extras, you feel for him, you want to help him, you want to take care of him. It would be easy to overplay this character in the film and make him over the top. Instead we are presented with a fleshed out character not only helping others but in need of help himself. We want him to get help but we also want him to succeed at the same time.

The rest of the cast does an equally good job though none stand out as Harrelson does. Kat Denning adds to her list of characters that come from a varied number of backgrounds and she does it well. Elias Koteas, once a hero himself in TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES as Casey Jones, has made slime ball characters his claim to fame and in this film you want to see him get his due.

Don't be misled. The movie doesn't offer spandex wearing heroes combating evil villains driving suped up cars. Heck, Defendor drives a cherry picker with a Defendog on the hood. No, here we see the grim and gritty real world of the big city where people ignore bad things happening all around them. The best way to survive is to not get involved. But with Defendor as an inspiration, perhaps that might change. .",1332201600,,4215,4.4411384217335055
4072059,3,B003626TNG,"Despite appearances, Defendor (as one reviewer points out) isn't a comedy.  It's a character study of a mentally impaired would-be costumed vigilante played by Woody Harrelson trying to right wrongs in his world.  Defendor has more in common with films like ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" or ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Lars and the Real Girl"" - but doesn't quite come close to those films.

Fans of Woody should enjoy this, and the film is well casted, acted and well filmed.  Great lighting cinematography makes this worthwhile.  The story doesn't really raise the stakes as it could, and plods a little - when it should fly.  Overall it's watchable but don't expect to hang on to your seats.

4072061,4,B003626TNG,"Tale focuses upon a man-child of low intelligence who believes drugs and a particular crime lord did his mother in and decides he will avenge all victims by becoming a superhero. It has some similarities to Super but came out earlier. Interestingly enough a series of flashbacks show how said superhero gets it totally wrong as to how his mother died yet never figures it out though we the audience get it. This is a dark tale with trace elements of humor and/or amusement. Like Batman the superhero refuses to use a gun and has to come up with cheap tools to defeat the villains. In essence, what ups the quality of this film is the mythological value of the hero's tale except in this particular instance it's the heroic tale of a fool, who sees and says things that ""ordinary"" people either do not see or refuse to acknowledge. The entire justice system is against him at first but it's fairly cool as how a lot of them come around at the end. Similar to Super this superhero has something of a love relationship with a damaged female.

And yet it's nice, frankly, to see Woody Harrelson command the screen again. That DEFENDOR is any kind of watchable can be mostly chalked up to Harrelson's ingratiating performance. You can't help but like the character he plays.

Arthur Poppington (Harrelson) has had a miserable living of life, so that's one criteria of what makes a superhero that you can check off. Abandoned by his mom and mentally challenged, Arthur has sublimated his painful childhood into motivation for his crimefighting crusade. Arthur Poppington, by day, is a traffic controller - that is, he holds up ""Stop"" and ""Slow"" signs - at a construction site. He dwells in the construction company's workshop without authorization, and he can't really function in society. But when the sun goes down, all that goes away and Arthur becomes the costumed street vigilante, Defendor. Only don't tell him that's not how you spell that word.

All these years, Defendor has prowled the streets, his overarching mission: to find his arch nemesis, that fiendish mastermind called ""Captain Industry."" During one of his night patrols, Defendor meets Katerina Debrofkowitz (Kat Dennings, awesome). Katerina is a young hooker, cynical and nursing a drug habit, who befriends him. More importantly, she has a lead to Captain Industry. In the dim corridors of Arthur's mind, this is the break he'd been looking for. He doesn't question the soiled dove. Off he goes.

DEFENDOR is graced with a talented ensemble.  Kat Dennings, again wonderfully offbeat, makes lemonade out of lemon with her played out role, and she's very sympathetic. The supporting cast is nicely rounded out by Elias Koteas's dirty cop, Michael Kelly's construction friend of Arthur's, Sandra Oh's court-assigned psychiatrist, and Clark Johnson's patient police chief. In a film that doesn't boast a huge cast, these few actors lend weight and grist and help to constuct a convincing world for an addled superhero to inhabit.

But it's Woody Harrelson's investment into his role that sells the film. There's a surface layer of comedy here, but you rapidly sense how potentially heartbreaking this all is. There's something sad and pathetic about Defendor, low-rent superhero. Defendor's homemade costume consists of shoe polish thickly applied around the eyes - and that's his mask - and duct tape on the chest crudely spelling out the letter ""D."" His weapons of choice are a World War I trench club, a supply of marbles, the occasional jar of angry wasps, and squirty lime juice (for interrogation purposes). When making his rounds, Defendor straps on a surveillance camera to his head, and it records to VHS tapes. Not having any real super powers, he copes about as well as you'd think out there in the unforgiving streets and dingy alleyways. That is, half the time, he gets his what handed to him. As the film becomes progressively grimmer, you can't help but grow very concerned for his safety, especially when he finally finds his Captain Industry.

DEFENDOR is darkly funny and tragic. It's also a bleak deconstruction of the superhero mythos; it delves into what makes up the troubled psyche of someone who's actually abnormal enough to put on a costume and vigilante up. There's a deep sadness here that Harrelson is able to bring to the surface. And again it's Harrelson's playing it straight that lends Defendor's earnestness and pain and heart that certain resonance.

Admittedly, the pace is on the slow side and there's not really a lot of action. This is more of a character study than a straight-up action film. But it's recommended viewing, to the tune of 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. And I guess there's something ultimately hopeful about not just an everyday bloke - but one with a disability - taking a stand and trying to do the right thing. Never mind that he proves rather ill-equipped for the job. The rest of us can only hope to have the heart and the soul of Arthur Poppington, a righteous kind of guy. You cannot front on Defendor.

I was expecting Kick-Ass with Woody Harrelson's character from Zombieland... what I got instead of a laugh riot was Kick-Ass meets Forest Gump, with a plot that moves slugishly forward but comes to the expected outcome. Clearly I was disappointed but I paid for it so I watched it to the end & I gotta say that overall it wasn't a bad movie, just was not what I was expecting.

Basically it's the story about a simple man who wants to make a difference in a setting that everyone is miserable in but no one actually wants to get involved (He even takes some pretty savage beatings for other people) determination and redemption.

Woody Harrelson plays this simple character almost to perfection. He doesn't undersell it in the slightest but he doesn't go ""full retard"" (Tropic Thunder reference don't start sending me hate mail) either.

This is one of those for me. I gained a new respect for Woody Harrelson due to the difficult character traits he has to portray and have the audience believe it - in fact, we as viewers are not sure of his belief system. One can see that the film's other characters aren't sure what to make of him either and as a result can underestimate or take advantage of him, which can be difficult to watch. As the film goes on, missing pieces in his background are filled in.

I enjoyed it very much and although it is very different, which will limit those who see and truly appreciate it, I think the message it conveys resonated with me, which is what the best films do.
I certainly recommend it to adventurous viewers and those who appreciate good acting and good scripts.",1290297600,2,961,4.338888888888889
4072073,3,B003626TNG,"Maybe it's my definition of comedy or dark comedy, but I generally think you should laugh or find something humorous somewhat regularly throughout a movie for it to called a comedy - but that's just me. So no belly laughs or 'OMG that's so freaking funny"" to be found here even for a dark comedy. Defendor has a couple of chuckle moments but nothing close to what it really takes to call a comedic. Some of the ""superhero weapons"" stuff are a little humorous once but just once then you've seen it, next please.

Anyway, the general premise of the movie about a guy who is a bit of a simpleton and believes he is a superhero out to avenge a past wrong by Captain Industry and stop those that commits crimes on his behalf. Defendor is a strange blender mix of a little bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blankman/dp/B00005T30A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blankman</a>, a cup of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;and just a pinch of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-am-Sam/dp/B000066HAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I am Sam</a>&nbsp;that is overall a good idea just poorly marketed under the wrong general genera. Now to be fair it's not a bad movie and you find yourself just as the people in the movie rooting for Defendor to save the day and correct what is wrong in the city by night because by day he is a mild mannered road work. All in all Defendor (the character) is misguided from a troubled past but has a good heart and a great friend (Paul) that only wants to help him, a girl (Kat) whom is a crackhead hooker that he only wants to help, Dr. (Ellen) that really wants to believe in him, cops that barely tolerate him and various criminals that want to kill him. But what will happen to him?

As I said it's a decent film, it's not a great film and I will not be adding to my collection anytime soon. Rent it if you want to, but you really won't be missing a lot if you don't nor will you be demanding your hour and half back if you do. Woody Harrelson turns in a good but increasingly typical not-quite-all-there-character in need of anger management performance so nothing new from him. It has a fairly decent script, and the acting across the board is good but the story just needed a little polish in my opinion but for a first effort by director Peter Stebbings it's better than most first efforts I've seen. I'm only giving it 3.5 stars as I'm taking one away for the misleading dark comedy tag and marketing and another half star for the rather choppy story line at times. The DVD has a few extras on it, deleted scenes, outtakes, featurette in which they admit it's more of a dark drama than a dark comedy and commentary which I haven't seen yet.

So in the end... meh it's OK. It's not an 'avoid it' nor is it a 'don't miss' watch it if you want too.",1287446400,4,2962,4.943775100401607

I expected a lighthearted story along the lines of Mystery Men, but what I got turned out to be a lot darker and far less fun that anticipated. Harrelson's character Aurther Poppington and his alter ego DEFENDOR(!!) have so much potential for both comedy and sweetness that the rest of the characters seem entirely flat by comparison. While touched on throughout, that potential is lost or more likely so totally misdirected that it leaves one feeling pretty blah.

The previews make this look like a funny movie about a guy who really wants to be a superhero and do the right thing. Well...it is about that but it's just not funny and frankly I feel terribly mislead. This is a bleak and dreary film with a few mildly elevating moments.

The 'emotionally/mentally disturbed individual who gets in way over his head' archetype was previously done in the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Special/dp/B001MYIXAM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Special</a>, although the level of brutality reaped on Defendor/Arthur Poppington is more akin to what happens to Dave Lizewski in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG983M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>. The 'Hooker with a Heart of Gold' supporting character 'Cat/Angel' (played by Kat Dennings) is -on the page at least- so cliched that it's almost a moot point to mention it. Whilst there are a few twists in turns in the script, if I was an investor, I might have considered this too derivative of previous movies to bother with funding it.

Which probably explains why I'm writing reviews on Amazon, and don't work in the film industry, as the people behind this movie did a great job. Woody Harrelson is excellent as Arthur Poppington, and turns in a subtle yet earnest performance. (Indeed, it would be hard to single out one actor for special praise, as they are all uniformly excellent, including the child actors.) The pacing of the film is great, the editing (with old School Star Wars-style wipes) thoughtful, and the DOP does an astonishing job with the lighting and the fiming, to the point where this movie 'feels' substantially more expensive than it actually was.

There are only a couple of points that belie a tight budget- the score is good, but clearly done on a synthesier/with a band, as opposed to an orchestra, and the director Peter Stebbings shoots the whole movie in about four locations, doing his best to dress it up to look different (and the fake snow looks like polystyrene chips). Finally, the cover of the DVD is so bad that it almost put me off buying it- I wouldn't be surprised if people thought this was a DTV cash-in made on the heels of Kick Ass, instead of the low-budget labour of love that it clearly is.

Whilst there are a load of movies in the 'kidding-themselves-on superhero sub-genre'(as well as the aforementioned Special and Kick Ass, there's also been the enjoyable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Specials/dp/B0001ZX0HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Specials</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Men/dp/B000035Z38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Men</a>&nbsp;and James Gunn's forthcoming Super) this is still an enjoyable (and emotional) movie that really cuts to the heart of what superheroes inspire in people. This film is ultimately not envelope pushing (but how many Superhero films really are?) but still enjoyable. More so than Kick Ass, it also makes me never want to put on a costume and try being a superhero- and one hopes that anyone tempted by the prospect of being a 'real life' superhero will pause for thought after seeing this [on a side note, an interesting but brief documentary on 'real life' vigilantes/super-heroes can be found in the special features of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-The-Ultimate-Cut/dp/B002Q9VPFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut</a>&nbsp;].",1285718400,4,3387,6.141350210970464

A delusional super hero, wasp grenades, and Woody Harrelson to boot. Sadly, the defendor, just didn't get there as a movie. It wasn't really a comedy and it was pretty sappy as a drama. I think if the script writer had dreamnt up a few more gadgets like the wasp grenade and gone after the kickass type angle this would have been a brilliant film.

4072080,5,B003626TNG,"This is an amazing film written and directed by Peter Stebbings, his debut no less.  Although the plot is familiar (a troubled man befriending a prostitute who deep down has a heart of gold as together they fight the good fight), this film tells it in a very unique way.  The included commentary was sometimes crude but proved enlightening.

The last movie I watched with Woody Harrelson was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>, so I was expected more of the same shtick since it was labeled as a comedy.  Instead, I was blown away by the great acting and storytelling.  I was amazed by Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the lead character.

We are introduced to Arthur Poppington, a construction worker with a very low IQ, who niavely believes he can find the man (aka Captain Industry) responsible for his mother's death.  Flashbacks of his childhood are chilling as we watch his drug addled mother leave him behind.  When Arthur runs across a young drug addicted prostitute (Kat) during one of his nightly exercises, we watch them form an odd relationship.  Soon enough he is telling her all about his secret life as ""Defendor"" and his quest to track down the nefarious Captain Industry.  Kat tells him she can help but she has her own agenda as she steers Arthur toward the local Kingpin of crime. The police also have this guy in their sights and things do not end well as their paths inadvertently cross. Arthur is subjected to a pysch evaluation what with his secret identity as Defendor and all.  A lot is revealed as Arthur explains all.  The story is intense and kept me glued to the screen until the very last shot.  No typical Hollywood ending here folks.  I found the beauty in this movie to be that even though Defendor did not have any of the super hero powers he imagined, he did posses a real power.  Other characters and the ending pay tribute to that.

After viewing the film, I wonder why it had a very limited theater release and grossed under $50,000 in the US.  It was a much bigger hit overseas.  I hope that this dvd will provide it the wide audience it deserves.",1279152000,6,2191,4.89159891598916

4072082,4,B003626TNG,"To kids, comic books are dramas, even when the hero and the villains say hackneyed and silly things.  The story remains powerful and true to kids who read comic books, and Defendor reminds adults of that magic.

Woody Harrelson stars as Arthur Poppington, an emotionally, socially, and educationally stunted man who works for a city construction crew by day.  At night, he dons a self-made vigilante costume to fight crime as Defendor.  He doesn't appear to be a very effective crime fighter: He gets beat up often, he uses kids' weapons (marbles, a slingshot), and he struggles to define and locate his nemesis, Captain Industry.

The movie is successful, because the tone is strong.  Writer/director Peter Stebbings does not make fun of the disadvantaged Arthur Poppington.  Naturally, most of the other characters think there's something wrong with him, but Woody Harrelson never mocks Poppington's shortcomings, something I doubt Stebbings would have allowed him to do.  Excellent performances by Kat Dennings and Michael Kelly contribute greatly to the success of the film.

Defendor is not a true comedy.  It has the guise of a comedy and even funny moments, but it's ultimately a drama, and one that is quite tragic.  Stebbings embraces all of the superhero and comic book lingo and clichs, but he isn't making a comic book film (like The Crow or Sin City).  Instead, Stebbings has written and directed a good dramatic tale that happens to have echoes of comic book stories.",1278288000,2,1481,5.024590163934426

There is less than 5 minutes of action and is more in the sleepy-boring-drama classification. After watching the first 45 minutes of the movie, I nearly fell asleep. It felt like two and a half hours had passed. Some parts of the dialogue was written as if trying to be `cool' but turned out to be stupid and immature. As for Woody's acting it's not a far stretch for him to play a whack job. So, therefore, his acting was okay. Sandra Oh wasn't given much of a dialogue to work with, so I don't blame her that much. Kat Dennings, I did not see much of her films so I can't really judge her performance but her performance on Defendor was really bad. I would like to tell Peter to quit his day job but this is his day job! What a shame for the film industry.

But any movie that can pull emotions out of you (Even if it is depression), is the mark of a good movie.  Bad movies just seem to pull apathy out of me, which technically I'm not sure is an emotion.

Woody's performance (although again typecast) in recent film roles is starting to show a larger range of expression and commitment to an understanding of his character.",1277510400,4,687,5.481132075471698
4072086,4,B003626TNG,"Reading the user reviews I was pretty sure what I was getting into with this and I was right in the best way. In the wrong hands this could have gone awry and played too much for the laughs. But as it stands here, it's a dark (gun metal gray) comedy but very, very touching.

Woody Harrelson plays the title character who is a bit ""slow"" and fancies himself a super hero though he has no super powers what so ever. He holds a menial job on a city's street crew and is watched over by his boss. At night he tries to right the wrongs and do away with ""Captain Industry"" so the world will be a better place. This puts him in harm's way with a big time thug and a corrupt cop. But he's honest to a fault and his honesty doesn't go unnoticed.

It's difficult to say how much I liked this film. Much of this has to do with Woody. Though I don't know if it's his best performance ever, I liked it more than anything else he's done. For my money he played the character to a ""T"". Yes, Defendor is slow witted but it might also be that he's just horribly naive. He has no wiles at all. He had a bad, neglected childhood, with a mother who succumbed to the dark side with drugs and booze. He was raised by his grandfather who just wasn't very good at it. Defendor wants the world to be a good place. A place he never had.

I like Elias Koteas a lot and he does a good job here. I only know Kat Dennings from ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"" but she's really good here as a girl who may very well go the way of Defendor's mom unless something or some one helps her change direction.

The direction might be considered by some to be too ""meat and potatoes"", but I think that is what it needed. Too much over statement might have pulled the heart out of it. Here, you get to know the characters. Even as scummy as the Elias Koteas cop is, he isn't just a two dimensional bad guy. There seems to be a certain weariness to him.

This is well worth the time spent to watch it. It's a very unique and well thought through piece with a good (maybe a bit sappy) ending. Take the time.",1274486400,10,2068,4.0588235294117645

4072088,5,B003626TNG,"How can anyone say this wasn't a comedy? Woody Harrelson does give one of the best performances of his career in this movie and it is a quite touching story of a mentally challenged crime fighter, but anyone who didn't think this was funny must have a very, very, dry sense of humor. This was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long, long time. The first half of the movie was much funnier than the second half, but the whole thing was hilarious. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie. I feel sad for anyone who watches this and doesn't find the humor in it. I think too many people get depressed watching a Woody's near perfect portrayal of a mentally challenged person. They are missing the point. The point of this movie is to show how even someone as dumb as this guy can make a difference, all they have to do is WANT to make a difference. Perhaps one of the most heartfelt comedies ever, I really enjoyed how they were able to make such an uplifting and comical story out of such sad content. Woody's character is not only slow, but he lives in the real world, where people are not nice, and most people will try to take advantage of, or hurt, someone if they think they can. Yeah, it can be depressing for anyone who thinks that's not the real world, but those people are ignorant, and blind to reality. I think everyone should take away from this movie a sense of desire to not just stand by and allow the world around us to turn to $h*t. If someone like this can stand up to the bad guys, why can't we? This is not to say that everyone should dress up like super heroes, that ridiculous and not at all what this movie is trying to convince people to do. It simply begs us to question whether or not it's really that hard to just try to help people.

Defendor is a man with some sort of cognitive impairment and is considered slow. He believes he is a superhero, and at night he goes out to battle crime. He is exploited by a teen prostitute who manipulates him into going after an ex-boyfriend who is a vice kingpin.  Defendor's mental impairment makes him believe bullets don't harm him and that he actually stands a chance against the villains he fights which results in him getting beat up. A lot. Sad. Eventually he becomes friends with the teen prostitute; however this friendship leaves a lot to be desired, since she has manipulated and used him.

I guess I was looking for something else when I rented this. While it had some cute moments, overall, I found the subject matter a bit sad. I was hoping (based on them marketing this as a comedy), for an off-beat superhero drama. This film is not. It is a dark film, with an occasional funny part, mostly involving Defendor's cognitive impariment.  My favorite scenes were when Defendor was being evaluated by his therapist.

Arthur Poppington is a delusional man who with the aid of a prostitute stumbles into a notorious drug supplier, weapons pusher, and human trafficker, in other words Captain Industry. A simple man taking on a seemingly unstoppable force with no weapons except some marbles, wasps, and the Defendog.

People who don't like this movie either never gave it a chance or just don't really understand the statement that Defendor is trying to make. It's a movie about the common man taking control of a situation and doing whatever it takes to change it. It's a movie that's not really funny or visually exciting but it is a movie that was obviously made with a great deal of love. These movies are the best to watch because the care that everyone involved put into it makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen. It made a strong statement to me and really made everything seem possible no matter how impossible it seems.

Give Defendor a chance and don't worry about the content. It wasn't made to poke fun of the mentally challenged, because really they are some of the most spectacular people on the planet. It justs shows that the truth is what you make it. It wasn't made to make poeple think they should put on tights and fight crime, but if you have something that needs changing, change it.

Arthur Poppington (Woody Harrelson) has a secret: when night rises upon the city, he takes to the streets as Defendor, a lone avenger on the hunt for the ever-elusive Captain Industry. Unfortunately for Arthur, he's mildly retarded and the line between right and wrong sometimes blurs. Though he means well, sometimes he gets in over his head, especially when his search for Captain Industry takes him into the city's underworld of drugs, guns and prostitution.

After saving the life of prostitute and drug-addict Kat Debrofkowitz (Kat Dennings), Arthur takes her in and, though at first exploited by her for money, the two eventually bond and he accomplishes one of his objectives he had ever since donning the Defendor uniform: helping those who need it most.

Being a lifelong superhero fan, there are a few things, to me, that define a good superhero movie and Defendor had more than one of those things. It touched me on that very human level of seeing a sincere human being trying to make a difference regardless of what other people think of him. Fear of man is one of the things I think holds people back from doing the right thing in real life. To at least see that attribute on the screen means a lot to me because it proves that people are still thinking about it even if it's just in a movie.

The trailer for this flick makes it come across as more like a superhero spoof than a serious movie, and this was most definitely a serious movie. Sure, there were some funny moments, but this movie wasn't about that, but instead was about a man who saw something wrong and did the best he could with what he knew how to do.

And he did. He showed us who Captain Industry really was: the villain that all of us have in each of out cities, the one comprised of drugs, guns and illegal sex that has ruined countless lives yet for some reason authorities refuse to do something about it.

This movie makes me think of the real life superheroes that are out there (Google ""Real Life Superheroes""), those real men and women who don guises of other personas and do what they can to help us. Lots of people mock them. Lots of people mocked Defendor, but when all is said and done, they, like Defendor, do the right thing and try to right a world full of wrongs, bring hope to those who need it, and set an example that we should all follow.

Defendor is a fantastic movie and I'm really glad Peter Stebbings went ahead and made this flick.

Fight back.

4072096,4,B003626TNG,"In 2009, writer/director Peter Stebbings (""G-Spot, ""Across the River to Motor City"", ""Rabbit Fall"") known for his television work began writing a script on a superhero story.  But instead of being the usual superhero story adaptation from a comic book series, Stebbings went deeper to explore a guy, who has mental issues but driven by personal situations that make him don a costume and become a superhero.

Next thing you know, the screenplay eventually grabs the interests of producers and also talent that the Canadian dark comedy/drama became a reality and four years after writing the script, ""Defendor"" was born and had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival and was released in theaters in Feb. 2010 and now available on DVD.
VIDEO:

""Defendor"" is presented in 2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  For the post part, the picture quality for this DVD is very good.  Would have been great to see Sony Pictures Home Entertainment consider this title for Blu-ray release but overall, the DVD features pretty good lighting during the night sequences and good detail on the scars of ""Defendor"".

For the most part, despite the film having a low budget, David Greene did a solid job in capturing the character of Arthur Poppington, a man with not much money and living at his friend's workshop.  Capturing the seedy hangouts of the underground and more.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Defendor"" is presented in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is dialogue driven and although there are plenty of action sequences, this is a film that doesn't sport explosions or anything significant in terms of immersive sound effects.

You will hear a good combination of music to the action sequences, Defendor using his slingshot weapon and the buzz of wasps and also the occasional gun shots.  But most of the sound effects take place near the end of the film.

But overall, dialogue and music soundtrack is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean and Thai.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Defendor"" comes with the following special features:

  * Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer/director Peter Stebbings, producer Nicholas Tabarrok, Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings.
  * Deleted Scenes - (2:35) A total of five deleted scenes: Paul gives package to Arthur, Kat washes Defendor Costume Reporter finding Dooney cuffed to hand rail, defense attorney hits on reporter, Arthur talks to reporter.
  * Outtakes - (2:23) Featuring outtakes and the kind of fun the talent had during the shooting of the film.
  * Origin Stories: The Genesis of Defendor - (10:14) Writer/Director Peter Stebbings talks about the making of ""Defendor"" and both he and producer Nicholas Tabarrok talk about the changes of the original script to the final cut of the film.
  * Removing the Costume: Behind the Screenplay - (11:29) A featurette about what Stebbings wanted to accomplish and make different from the usual superhero films.
  * Heroes and Villains: Meet the Players - (20:11) The cast talk about why they took the part and wanted to be on the film, producers and crew talk about hiring the cast and more.
  * An Actor's Director: Working with Peter Stebbings - (4:56) Cast talk about working with Peter Stebbings and their joy of working with him.
  * Famous Last Words: Wrapping Defendor - (9:38) Writer/Director Peter Stebbings and producer Nicholas Tabarrok talk about the completion of ""Defendor"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Defendor"" was a delightful surprise.  When you come across superhero films about normal people donning a uniform and not based on a popular comic book superhero, more than likely the film is probably going to suck.  And the fact the main hero was played by Woody Harrelson was a bit confusing because I couldn't picture it.

But after watching the film, not only do we get a well-written film by Peter Stebbings but Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings absolutely shine in this film.

Woody Harrelson plays the character of Arthur Poppington, an older man who suffers from mental issues and due to his mother being consumed by drugs, since he was younger, he has developed this hatred towards criminals and because his grandfather raised him with comic books, Arthur wants to be a superhero.

This is what is so unique about ""Defendor"" is that, this man is a normal man.  No special powers, no major fighting skills but determined to fight against criminals and to get back at a person who may have killed his mother.

Kat Dennings has been one of my favorite actresses as she brings this depth to her character in a film and with ""Defendor"", she really brings a depth into her character Kat, a drug abuser and girl living off the streets and pulling tricks.  She's never had any significant parental guidance, she is a victim of her father and people on the streets and when she meets Arthur, at first, she thinks of him as some type of kook but realizes his true intentions which are sincere, pure and that he actually cares for her.

Overall, Peter Stebbings manages to bring together dark comedy and drama to ""Defendor"" and what could have been a major mess of a film to join with other crappy superhero films, ""Defendor"" ends up separating from those and becoming an entertaining film that is one of the better non-comic book superhero films out there.

I absolutely enjoyed ""Defendor"" and if you are a fan of superhero films, this is definitely a film worth checking out!

4072098,4,B003626TNG,"""Defendor"" is excellent, but it is not easy.  The script updates and adapts Don Quixote, point for point, and it reminds us how Cervantes's simple idea remains a potent satirical and comic innovation.  There is very, very, very little sentiment or sappiness thrown about here, and all hands, from the prickly Dulcinea (Angel, Kat) to the wiser Pancho (Patrick), remains true to what made Cervantes powerful for being uneasy.

The Don read the heroic tales, saw a real world gone awry, and opted to see it in the moral absolutes.  We have been conditioned by some damaging interpretations in the 1960's, where Quixote gets to be a sap, a dreamer, and a lovable loser, as he becomes a ""man of LaMancha"" or someone who thinks ""they might be giants.""  Cervantes's Don is worthwhile because he is, unquestionably, someone we laugh at, and yet we know why he does what he does.  Woody Harrelson has an enormous task in front of him:  he has to make a creature whose sympathy is in honesty and whose ridiculousness is in the same trait.

However, by choosing to make this Defen-don retarded, we have an unnecessary problem.  Perhaps only a mentally retarded individual has the license to believe in justice?  Perhaps, satirically, it is ""retarded"" to believe in justice?  Perhaps it requires an inability to understand the complexity of society to see the truth of evil?  Regardless, it is a complexity of plotting and theme that adds to the difficulty of reception for an audience.

The movie?  It's great.
The subject matter is rated R, but that's the world.  The hero is rated G.

This is a strikingly good film, both as a sneaky literary adaptation and as an apt satire of crime, capitalism, and lies.  Overturn the stupidity of Hollywood's marketeers and see it yourselves.",1271548800,5,1771,4.811258278145695
4072099,5,B003626TNG,"While KICK-ASS (Opening April 16, 2010) got all the press, DEFENDOR has all the heart. A sweet but dark combination of TAXI DRIVER and BATMAN, DEFENDOR answers the question of 'what if super-heroes' existed in a very sentimental yet mature manner. Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Arthur Poppington is just as worthy of an Oscar nomination as his role in THE MESSENGER. Harrelson's Poppington is a mentally challenged adult dealing with a very dark and tragic childhood by taking on the persona of 'The Defendor,' a comic book inspired super-hero. Writer-Director Peter Stebbings captures the true magic and meaning comic book heroes have in our modern society. Placing the innocence of Harrelson's Poppington/Defendor in the midst of a very real city suffering from corrupt cops, drug dealers, child sex trafficers and abused prostitutes makes for a very unique and adult viewing experience. The film is a sometimes lyrical poem, a sad reminder of how it is and how it would be for a real super-hero. Yet, unlike KICK-ASS, DEFENDOR is a reminder that there is value and valor in morality, courage and doing the right thing in the face powerful evil. DEFENDOR, like KICK-ASS, does goes for the laughs. There are moments of brilliant and hilarious humor to be found here, both dark and sweet. Unlike KICK-ASS, there are also moments of genuine sentiment and inspiration. The two films tell the same story in very different ways. It's a shame that KICK-ASS will make millions and become a pop-culture hit while DEFENDOR will have to tough it out on home video. Hopefully, DEFENDOR will develop a cult following and in time get the true praise and audience it deserves.",1271462400,26,1664,4.989208633093525

It is not a comedy, but it is has its funny moments.  It is more like a crime drama and not your average Superhero movie.  This is a heartwarming movie and you will cheer for ""Defendor"".",1271289600,2,448,4.188235294117647

It's not a high-budget super hero flick. It is about the people. While we each can't fix the entire world, we all can help fix our worlds around us.",1500940800,,424,5.057142857142857
