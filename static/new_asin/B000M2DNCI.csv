8165820,4,B000M2DNCI,"""Adhesive Rod Boxing"" is an excellent example of the English-language content this video DOESN'T have.  Another translation was ""gluing poles!"" All of the Li Bingci materials would benefit tremendously from competent English translation.  The subtitles are so haphazard as to be occasionally unintentionally humorous.

The good you get from this training DVD, if you don't speak Chinese (or read subtitles in another Chinese dialect which I am equally ignorant of) will come primarily from observation. Li Bingci demonstrates Wu (not Hao) taiji (or ""tai chi"") ""push hands"" practice. This is a taiji partner exercise. He shows pre-arranged exercises - not competition freestyle or practical applications for defense, but a scripted practice in deflecting an opponent's motion and pushing back (to be deflected in turn). He does demonstrate personally, with a student.

The ""gluing poles/adhesive rod"" practice uses long staves in a similar fashion; low-line contact (about knee level) is made with an armed partner, and then a prearranged pattern which maintains contact between the weapons is followed. Similar to Wing Tsun's ""Sticky Hands"". However, like the ""push hands"" it is not demonstrated freestyle (and nobody with sense would go ""freestyle"" with hefty wooden weapons).

These are no-frills videos, shot with one camera from one angle (although he may change his own body position to show another angle).",1199232000,,1412,5.488479262672811
