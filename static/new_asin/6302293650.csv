8606031,5,6302293650,"Faerie tales are my main interest, and Joan Sugarman's adaption of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is by far the best film adaption I have ever seen. The reason it is worth seeing is because it is precisely not your average Disney version.
This version of ""Sleeping Beauty"" is in a medieval setting, and is a lot more rouneded than most other versions. This film is narrated, but that doesn't interfere at all with the interacions of the characters. It is merely a plot-moving device.
The fact that this movie is medieval, most importantly gives it the perfect atmosphere. The costumes in this film are superb. The castles and sets used really bring the plot and characters to life. The acting is fabulous. By this I mean that the Wicked Faerie is actually scary, casting spells, and brewing potions etc, so she is your classic hag-the only way to portray an evil witch. I wouldn't advise showing this to children five years old or under.
Another great thing about ""Sleeping Beauty"" is that you meet not only the royal family, but also those below them, such as the chef, kitchen boys and housemaids etc. You meet the peasants around the palace. This could therefore be something from 1500 or so, just inserted into the television screen. In other words, the people who weren't so powerful actually have a role here. Their contribution to the palace is recognised. It certainly makes the story funnier.
The music score is mysterious and enchanting-not to say that Tchaikovsky isn't anything but wonderful, but this is a little more unnerving, particularly in scenes with the faeries. There are twelve Good Faeries, as in the story, and they live in a lake. The music for these scenes and the special effects are unreal.
This film is representative of a significant amount of time and effort. Please don't pass it over because it's not animated. There is still all the fun of the classic faerie tale. The thing I loved the most about this of all is its traditional feel. This may be one adults would be interested in. This film will never be obsolete, because it appeals to any age-group. This is a faerie tale with a difference, which makes it even more a classic!
I hope you found my review informative, and enjoy the film as much as I did!
