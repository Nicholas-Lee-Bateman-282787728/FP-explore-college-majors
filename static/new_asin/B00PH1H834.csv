8687867,4,B00PH1H834,"An interesting group of shows that never made it to series.  Some are somewhat interesting.  Some are a bit odd.  But it is obvious why none were made into series (although with modifications Space Police became Space Precinct).  The shows aren't very good.  But if you're a true Anderson fan these are gotta see, even if only once.",1521849600,4,332,4.655172413793103
8687868,5,B00PH1H834,Long overdue for the North American market!! Love the compilation of the Lost Worlds of Gerry Anderson. Bought it as soon as I heard it was available. Thank you so much!!! Love all GA works from Thunderbirds to beyond Space: 1999.,1514764800,3,230,4.634146341463414
8687869,4,B00PH1H834,"A collection of ""different"" TV pilots, short films, and even a commerciel or two!

Day After Tomorrow I like since it was BOTH Nick Tate and Brian Blessad in it.  Had a nice, if not purfect, attention to some of the realities of space travel.

Was good to see Shane Rimmer in another role again also.",1471046400,5,300,4.321428571428571
