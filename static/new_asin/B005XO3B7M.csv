4903409,5,B005XO3B7M,"I actually watched THE GREATEST LOVE on Drama Fever via Roku, but if you are looking for a great Korean Drama with English subtitles, you can't go wrong with this set of 16 episodes.

If you haven't discovered Korean Dramas, I urge you to give them a try.  I abhor Kung Fu movies and have never enjoyed foreign films, but Korean Dramas are all I watch now, it seems.  I love the plots and learning about their culture, but also because Korean films are so unpredictable.  You never know how many of them are going to end! Likewise, virtually all of these series have a set number of episodes of 16-24 hour episodes, like the mini-series that we have in the U.S., rather than programs that go on for years if they are successful.

THE GREATEST LOVE is a rather charming, but odd movie in some ways.  It is about Koo Ae-Jeong, who was previously a huge star in an all-girl group - kind of like The Spice Girls.  The group disbanded and for the last 10 years, she has been the sole supporter of her family.  She has earned her money by singing in dives and taking almost any singing job she can get.

She abruptly meets Dokgo, who is this mega movie star.  He is arrogant and ridiculously proud, but finds himself strangely drawn to her.  Amazingly, Dokgo can't fathom why he is the least bit interested in Koo Ae-Jeong, as he considers her totally beneath him.  OK - This is the part that is odd:  It turns out that Dokgo has an artificial heart and years ago while he was undergoing surgery - his doctor was listening to music performed by Koo Ae-Jeong and her girl group, as he felt that he performed better surgery while listening to music.  And THAT is why Dokgo is so enamored with her.  (We won't even ask how he is able to be insured for his movies with an artificial heart - but that is another story!!)

In spite of a few stretches to the imagination, this movie really is very cute and the acting is brilliant!",1323820800,15,1918,4.345505617977528

8488761,4,B005XO3B7M,"Let's just say, this story is like a fairy tale. The characters are great which means the cast is wonderful. I loved the zany crazy people in this story. It is fun, not to be taken too seriously, but gives hope. I am glad I bought it. It took me too long to review it, but better late than never. I just make many purchases from Amazon as they don't disappoint either!",1401753600,,368,4.125
8488762,3,B005XO3B7M,"Koo Ae-jeong, is a former star singer from a girl group, ""Treasure Girls."" Years later, she is trying desperately to become a celebrity again with the help of her brother who is working as her manager. Ae-jeong lost fame after the group broke up due to an incident that Ae-jeong bravely took the blame for to help out a friend. But the people that happen to remember her only think of the incident and have hateful things to say about her. And it doesn't help that her past manager and one of the past ""Treasure Girls"" are making the rumors even worse.

One day Ae-jeong meets Doko Jin, an arrogant and difficult popular actor. Many misunderstandings rise between them as they frequently cross paths.

Eventually, Doko Jin finds himself drawn to Ae-jeong. His heart keeps going ""thump"" ""thump"" ""thump"" when he's near her. He later finds out that Ae-jeong's singing is what saved him during heart surgery. His heart started beating again along with the music when the doctor played the ""Treasure Girls"" famous song, ""Pit-a-Pat,"" during the surgery. He then dismisses his feelings as a coincidence instead of it being love.

Their meeting brings on a whole new set of problems and obstacles. Doko and Ae-jeong don't seem to have feelings for each other at the same time the other one does. Coincidentally, being around Doko is helping Ae-jeong get her career back on track, but being around Ae-jeong is bringing down Doko's career. Also, a ""Treasure Girl"" is after Doko and a man that likes Ae-jeong steps into the picture when he is brought onto a bachelor reality show, ""Couple Making"" with Ae-jeong. Plus, Doko is having chest pains and isn't sure if he will live through another surgery. Will these two ever recover from their past and current issues and be together?

This drama wasn't one of my favorites, it got a bit boring at times, but does have it's highlights. It's funny, a bit romantic, and dramatic throughout the show. The music is fun. I have the music on my iPod. I would recommend watching this romantic comedy at least once. (16 episodes)",1390089600,,2056,4.750700280112045

Most of all, I have fallen in love with the soundtrack.  My new love now is Korean drama and I enjoy learning about their culture.",1350345600,2,303,4.135593220338983
8488767,5,B005XO3B7M,Greatest Love is one of my favorite all-time K-drama and I'm glad I added it to my library. Cha Seung-Won is one of my favorite actors and I have seen everything that he has starred in. The drama is funny and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Cha Seung-Won was made for this role and he plays this role well. I highly recommend it.,1342915200,3,332,4.045454545454546
8488768,5,B005XO3B7M,"Absolutely love this film!!!!  The story is wonderful and so much fun.  I find my self crying, laughing and getting that warm fuzzy feeling!  I've watched it several times already and the story just doesn't get old.

I will note for family viewing, there is minor reference to ""woohoo"".  Mostly verbal reference and few ""imagination"" sequences that reference sexual situations but nothing overt. Would give it a PG rating.",1336435200,4,422,5.057971014492754
8488769,5,B005XO3B7M,"As a huuuuuge fan of Korean Dramas, this lovely story definitely goes into my top 10 list.

Not only is Gu Aejong (Gong Hyo Jin) an absolutely adorable character as a ""has-been"" star, she captures your heart with her portrayal of a determined and loyal family member and friend.  She makes her character shine and you can't help admiring her throughout the series.  She's an amazing actress- you can actually see her in the KDrama Pasta (one of my favorites as well)

This series will make you laugh, it will make you mad at the ""villains"" and it will make you sigh.",1332806400,4,566,4.519607843137255
