4685696,3,B005FSS536,One of Hollywood's greatest couples.  It was great seeing them together on screen  but would have liked another settle of story .  I do enjoy this play and they were good in it but given their legacy I would have hoped they deserved a more unique vehicle to showcase their talents,1369180800,,280,4.450980392156863

4685698,4,B005FSS536,"Of course it's dated, but can Douglas Fairbanks' comedic talent and his athleticism EVER be too old?  I don't think so.  And his wife is no slouch.",1356652800,,147,4.407407407407407
4685699,4,B005FSS536,"This has always been one of my favorite Shakespeare plays. It is a play that depends mightily on the quality of the scenery chewing and nobody chews scenery like the stars of the silent era (perhaps because they didn't have to worry about the propriety of talking with their mouths full). I have seen several silent films - a genre I love - starring Douglas Fairbanks and one or two starring Mary Pickford. This is an early talky and I understand it was their only film together. They handled sound very well.

I think having a married couple play Kate and Petruchio adds a lot of depth to this war (literally) of the sexes. I thoroughly enjoyed the interaction between Pickford and Fairbanks. Mary Pickford, known as America's Sweetheart, is playing against type as Kate but she just grabbed hold with both hands and then threw it at Douglas Fairbanks who also seemed to be having a really good time while ducking.

I watched this for free through Amazon Prime. Another good version available for free with Prime is the Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor film from the 1960's. That is my absolute favorite film version. I am really sorry that Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson didn't film Shrew before they divorced - in my opinion this is no play for exes. I bet it would have been fun (I loved their Much Ado About Nothing).",1350604800,,1324,4.653846153846154
4685700,4,B005FSS536,"I just watched the 1929 film version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, the first Shakespearean talkie.  Thanks to Amazon for making this very special film available online.  I have watched it numerous times and always enjoy seeing it again.  About four years ago I was first introduced to the film work of Mary Pickford, the first and greatest star of American silent films.  Now having seen so many of her films I have to admit, I'm simply in love with Mary Pickford!  She and Douglas Fairbanks, wife and husband in real life, are well cast as Petruchio and Kate.  The script is a very trim version of Shakespeare's play.  Pickford had never before attempted Shakespeare, although there is a lovely scene in the 1919 silent film Daddy-Long-Legs where Mary plays Juliet in an Al Fresco school production.  I hope Amazon makes Pickford's Daddy-Long-Legs available online soon.  But with The Taming of the Shrew, Pickford is speaking Shakespeare on film for the first time and she and Fairbanks do a fine job handling the dialogue.  Of course, they are especially excellent with the nonverbal moments; both were stars of silent film.  I hope Amazon makes one of Pickford's greatest films available sooner than later, the 1918 silent Stella Marris. In Stella Marris Pickford plays two roles, sometimes on screen at the same time.  Mary Pickford - one of our great film pioneers!",1329868800,8,1383,4.888412017167382
4685701,2,B005FSS536,"As a piece of cinema history, this is valuable: Fairbanks and Pickford were one of the first megastar couples in the first days of the talkies. As a treatment of The Taming of the Shrew, it's hopelessly reductive. It's shrunk to barely more than an hour, and much of that is spent on things that really aren't Shakespeare, while leaving out serious plot connections that are required to make sense of the play.",1441584000,,410,4.63013698630137
4685702,3,B005FSS536,"This movie is truly strange. You get to hear the voice of Pickford and Fairbanks. They spend most of the movie snapping whips at each other. She makes faces. He laughs and laughs and laughs. And he delivers his famous soliloquy to a dog. I read somewhere that they used David Garrick's version of Shakespeare's play, doubtless because it's shorter and easier to understand. Kiss Me, Kate is more fun.",1441238400,,400,4.728571428571429
4685703,5,B005FSS536,"One of the great movies: swashbuckler meets bitch (yes, sweet Mary Pickford!)",1431475200,,77,5.5
4685704,3,B005FSS536,"Yes, Sam Taylor's Americanized version of THE TAMING OF THE SHREW deserves to be studied as the oldest ""full-length"" talking picture adapted from Shakespeare, although a tiny percentage of Shakespeare's lines are actually used, and there are no experienced Shakespeareans in the cast. While Pickford is a spunky little spitfire, her one memorably potent speech comes not from Shakespeare but from David Garrick's rewrite of the play. Fairbanks is simply out of his depth as an actor; evidently he has been too busy practicing his bravura mannerisms (his whip cracking and his not-so-ingratiating laughter) to memorize his dialogue adequately.

The elimination of subplots is regrettable, yet the director's interpretation of the play gradually becomes more interesting: Since the on-screen actor cannot speak directly to his audience as he would in a live theater, Petruchio confides in his *dog* (""This is a way to kill a wife with kindness""). Meanwhile, his bride, ""Kat,"" is overhearing every word, and she visibly resolves to outsmart him with some deft manipulation of her own. Her final scene falls flat, but she apparently survives to fight with him another day.

Thanks to one of New York's movie revival houses, I did have a chance to see the original 1929 version, which is startlingly slow-paced for a comedy (talking pictures were new, and some relatively long stretches of footage have neither dialogue nor incidental music, nor the lively pantomime that might have been expected in a silent comedy). When the film was reedited under Mary Pickford's supervision in 1966, it was updated not only by trimming the most tiresome stretches and adding music but even by having a fresh voice rerecord some of the minor characters' lines.

To tell the truth, the viewer is not really missing much by watching the 1966 version. Of course, releasing both the original edition and the reedit on the same disc seems like an obviously good idea. Evidently the Pickford estate doesn't agree, and only the later, shorter version has surfaced on home video so far.

Ultimately, we can't help wishing that THE TAMING OF THE SHREW had been (in every way) a more successful movie, so that a more ambitious project such as HAMLET starring John Barrymore might have found proper backing and gotten off the ground.",1424736000,,2304,5.087301587301587
4685705,2,B005FSS536,"Interesting as film history but not much else. It's a transitional film from silent to talkies so the camera is locked in a box during the dialogue scenes and hyperkinetic in the passages between dialogue. Fairbanks had some stage training and is decent and it's fascinating to hear his voice which has an oddly wise-ass urban gruffness to it that feels very contemporary. That may be his interpretation of Petruchio but I doubt it. Pickford is kind of awful. Her voice is mushy and flutey at the same time and she seems to be trying to combine grand stage acting with slow on the uptake silent film faces. A strange and unsuccessful adaptation. I purchased it on Amazon mainly to see the brilliant William Cameron Menzies' production design which is somewhat of a disappointment. The sets are often sumptuous but they have a stage decor quality with a lot of painted canvas with seams showing. They're also not given too much of an aesthetic twist (unlike a lot of William Cameron Menzies' work) and stay pretty faithful to the period though there are touches of art deco and some arts and crafts (Petruchio plays solitaire in the film with a pack of the Rider-Waite Tarot). And as other reviewers have said, this is a somewhat chopped up and rearranged version of the original film.",1411516800,2,1284,4.736607142857143
4685706,5,B005FSS536,I got this because my Mother had worked for Mary Pickford as a personal maid. I was baptized there in Los Angeles. Mary is my God Mother. Hope I can pass on my Amazon stuff since this is only on line.,1398211200,2,200,3.902439024390244

4685708,5,B005FSS536,"Considering the year and the fact that it is Shakespere, it is good.  Funny at times and very good.  For those who like Pickford and Fairbanks, it's a talkie!",1382659200,,158,4.413793103448276
4685709,1,B005FSS536,"This movie's main claim to attention is the fact that it is the only film that starred husband-and-wife team of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford. It was released in 1929, and while it is understandably dated, both in acting style and camera technique, it is an important historical artifact. Unfortunately, it was seriously distorted when attempts were made 37 years later to ""update"" it by adding a new music track and cutting about 9 minutes from a film that was short to begin with. (The version offered here is only one hour and five minutes long.) It becomes immediately apparent in the opening credits, which are in a visual style totally foreign to 1929 Hollywood, set to music that is also anachronistic, and it is confirmed in the credit line that says it was copyrighted in 1966 by Mary Pickford (who was then 74) and Douglas Fairbanks JR. The fact is that very old films such as this are usually of interest only to those who, like myself,  enjoy the look and sound of vintage Hollywood films; the cosmetic disfigurement that was perpetrated to try to increase its appeal is probably nowhere near enough to make the film palatable to those who want something more ""updated."" It would have been much better had they actually restored the picture quality, which in this version ranges from so-so to poor. All in all, a thoroughly misguided tampering that should be indicated prominently on the cover of this disappointingly mutilated edition. Buyer beware!",1382486400,19,1472,4.864541832669323

On the other hand, the film includes only one of two plots and so totally revises the ending. Also Shakespeare's text is not only truncated almost beyond recognition but Americsnized so that the rhythm and power of the language are often list. Still: seeing Fairbanks and Pickford stacking each other with whips in the famous wooing scene is worth the price of the film.",1473292800,,578,4.848484848484849
