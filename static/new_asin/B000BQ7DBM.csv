8090908,5,B000BQ7DBM,"This is one of the best World War 2 series ever made. A previous reviewer disparaged the series as just a collection of old ""newsreels"". I strongly disagree. It is actual footage of the times, that is correct, just as ""Victory at Sea"" and ""The World at War"" were. That is one of its great strengths. No CGI, modern revisionist history or modern interviews - a straight historical accounting of Canada's role in the war.

I remember seeing this program being played at my school during the early 60s and later purchased this DVD version of the series advertised here. It remains mesmerizing. Put together a scant 17 years after the war, with the events still in the minds of the public (the veterans of the war then in their early 40s) it provides a full accounting of Canada's substantial contribution to the war - from its participation in Bomber Command to its contributions to the North African, Italian, North European, North Atlantic and Pacific campaigns. Few people realize that at the end of WW2, Canada had the third largest navy in the world. With a population about the size of New York State, its part in the war was substantial. Also included are significant social and political events on the Canadian home front.

One could not do a review of this series without praising the superb musical score by Donald Brittain - as significant a contribution as Richard Rogers' score was to the Victory at Sea series.

I highly recommend this series to Canadians who want to learn more about their own country's proud history as well as viewers from other countries who wish to learn more about Canada's significant part in the war. On a personal note, my father flew 2 tours in RCAF 6th group, RAF Bomber Command during the war. The sections on his comrades always fill me with pride. God bless all those Canadians who served. This is a fitting tribute!",1502755200,,1858,4.693251533742331
