8482443,4,B005PCN7EE,"I absolutely love Rainie Yang.  She was in the very first Taiwanese drama I watched.  I had watched this series awhile ago on Youtube, and was lucky enough to have English subs.  So I was very happy to see that it was available on Amazon with subs.  It has been so long since I have watched it, I can't remember all that happens, but I do know that I enjoyed the series.  I have watched the first 6 episodes, and I only have one complaint - which is why this product got 4 out of 5 stars.  The subs are not the greatest.  Some of them are perfect, others you get the general meaning of what they are talking about, but then sometimes, they don't make any sense at all.  Easy words are often misspelled too.  They definitely needed another person to edit them before they released these DVDs.  But that hasn't keep me from enjoying the drama, so it is still worth picking up if you are a fan of Rainie or just like Asian dramas.",1432339200,,927,4.186440677966102
