3095832,1,B0012RCNGE,This product stinks. It is virtually unwatchable even when played in an upscaling DVD player. It's playback picture is totally washed out and the focus is so bad that the picture can't be watched. Contacted the vendor twice via Amazon email in this regard but never got a response. My recommendation is do not buy this item.,1271808000,8,324,4.701754385964913
3095833,4,B0012RCNGE,"Everything about this transfer to DVD is low quality, from the horrible looking cover to the lower than vhs quality of the movie itself.
I had seen this for free on Comcast On Demand and that was better quality than this release from Obsession Entertainment. iTunes has this movie to purchase through Apple TV and that version looks beautiful.
I will definitely think twice before making a purchase that was released by Obsession Entertainment. Very disappointing.
I'll give this movie 4 stars just for Kristen Baker, what a sweetheart.",1264377600,3,536,5.033707865168539
3095834,1,B0012RCNGE,"I haven't seen the DVD shown here but it seems to be a bootleg from a VHS source.  I have the old Vestron laserdisc and the transfer leaves a lot to be desired- from what I've seen of the new Unbox transfer from MGM (who currently owns the rights to the movie, as it was owned by Orion beforehand) it looks like they've done a nice new 16x9 transfer with cleaned-up sound- why isn't THAT transfer available on DVD?  I would buy that in an instant.

I live near where this was filmed (even work across the street from the place that serves as the gas company headquarters!) The old gas station still exists but is now a California Recycling Center; the nicer Chevron/Pyramid station was torn down and paved over a long time ago, it's now just an extension of the parking lot!  Keep your eyes open for a brief shot of beautiful Del Paso Boulevard, followed by a geographical error as the motorcycle gang rides up the wrong street.",1238457600,6,928,4.409356725146199
3095835,4,B0012RCNGE,"If you like seeing slender young women in skimpy outfits, this movie's for you!  You get to see them on stage in nothing but panties and heels, in panties and bras (or less) in a locker room, in shorts and short T-shirts working at a service station, playing catch with a beach ball in string bikinis, stripping off their short blouses, and in harem outfits.

There's also slapstick as young men take turns squirting each other with automobile fluids, and whacking two old men with boards.

Excellent burlesque entertainment!",1235692800,3,525,4.876404494382022
3095836,3,B0012RCNGE,"I know in the IMDB this movie is listed with a release year of 1979 but plenty of the jokes are from the early 20th century. The story and dialogue read like the producers hired some dirty old men who had once possibly worked in a vaudeville theater, possibly as janitors, to expand a porn script into a full length feature film suitable for drive-in theaters. Seriously, many of the jokes sound like something your creepy Grandpa Joe would tell down t the VFW post when Joey Heatherton would pop in on the Merv Griffin Show.

  That might explain why there are so many dirty old men in the beginning of this movie. In one scene, during a high school graduation ceremony, a bunch of girls have their gowns torn off as part of a prank, revealing their Good & Plenty's. All the guys in the audience start hooting and hollering, even the old dudes. This means that even if they weren't hooting at their topless daughters, they were still hooting at their topless daughters topless best friends, which is still Creep-O-Rama. What would you say to them the next time they dropped by the house for dinner? And Huntz Hall, who plays Kirsten baker's Uncle Joe, looks straight down her top when she comes to his gas station dressed in her prom night finest. Maybe he was checking for melanoma.
  Anyway, the movie is about a gas station run by the aforementioned Huntz Hall, which is going out of business because of a shiny big new gas station, which opens across the street. Huntz has a heart attack and Kirsten and her friends decide to take over running the station in order to keep it from closing. They decide they can beat the new station with all its amenities by sexyin' up their joint. If the story were any thinner you could serve it at McDonalds between two buns and a pickle.

  But you know what? The darn movie grows on you. The jokes eventually become more charming in a corny way. For example, after Uncle Joe's heart attack, his doctor walks away from Uncle Joe's sick bed shaking his head. As he approaches the family, still shaking his head vigorously from side to side, they grow anxious and one of them blurts out,"" Doctor, what's wrong?"" The doctor massages the back of his neck with his hand and says, "" My neck, I've had a terrible crick in it for almost a week"".

  The girls aren't hard on the eyes either. There's Kirsten baker, straight from Norway, who plays the cute girl next door, June, Sandy Johnson, a former Playmate, who plays April, the good natured, curvaceous ditz, Linda Lawrence, who plays the girl who's been around the block more times than the neighborhood dog walker, and Leslie King, who plays the brainy nerd who blossoms under the loving wing of a motorcycle gang member named Peewee.

  That gang is something special. They're a lot less like Hunter Thompson's version of Hell's Angels and more like the bad kids from Grease. While they wear leather jackets, tool around on bad looking choppers and even smoke, the absolute worst thing they do is...litter. Yup they knock over a garbage can, and it's not even a full garbage can at that. After they push it over one piece of crumpled up paper rolls out. However, the Vultures do have the Vulture salute, and their leader is soap opera heartthrob Steve bond, whose hair is the only thing more indestructible than his ego.

  To bottom line it for you, this movie has a few laughs, a few dirty jokes, a bit of naive 70's charm and a little topless nudity. It's probably best enjoyed chillin' with some villains and your beverage of choice as amateur MSTK3 fodder. Conversely it's also a soothing balm for when you're lying on the couch recovering from a night on the town. It's pleasant and undemanding yet just stimulating enough to help keep your heart beating.",1230508800,19,3752,4.576119402985075
3095837,3,B0012RCNGE,"If you just want the movie than it's worth it since it's not in any other form, but as a warning the transfer is not very good and is obviously from a videotape. The picture is clear but not digital so the image isn't greatly defined.",1229904000,3,234,4.108695652173913
3095838,1,B0012RCNGE,"Try to wait for a better version of this movie to come out on DVD if you can.  This DVD looks like it was mastered from a VHS copy.

3095839,3,B0012RCNGE,"I first saw this film at a drive-in theatre in Georgia in 1979. The original pre-release title was to be ""Super Duper Service Station"". I also owned the VHS video release at one time. I never thought it would finally ever be released on DVD!! It stars Kirsten (not Kristen as it says on the front cover of the DVD's sleeve!!) Baker who was later seen as ""Terri"", one of the short-lived summer camp counselors in ""Friday the 13th Part 2"". It co-stars three old familiar faces, Huntz Hall of ""The Bowery Boys"", Joe E. Ross from t.v.'s ""Car 54 Where Are You?"" and Mike Mazurki. The film is fun and pleasant to watch. If you love the old drive-in exploitation films, then I can highly recommend ""Gas Pump Girls"". Three stars for the film but I am afraid only one for the quality of the DVD transfer. Could and should have been much better. A real shame.",1203379200,15,849,4.379746835443038

3095964,3,B0012RCNGE,"Yes, this one coulda-woulda: with great character actors, Huntz Hall, last seen on screen in 1970 (?), Joe E. Ross, and Mike Mazurki, on the scene (and a nice flowing ""narrative"" by famous New York Dee-Jay Cousin Bruce Morrow, in his ""A.M.""/ ""Cousin Brucie"" mode), a lot more could have been done.

The director and writer try to blend 1959 with 1979 and it really does not work. The Vultures are local bikers who spend most of their time challenging the nice kids, recent High School graduates. They all get together when challenged by the neighboring Gas Station, owned by a decidedly unscrupulous guy, who manages to constantly screw a nice old guy, Huntz Hall, uncle of Kristen Baker. She takes over his job when he can't take the pressure any more.

Kristen recalls that at the Graduation, a prankster tore up the robes of some of the girls and ...the Graduation finale was a strip show!  So why not get that kind of attention...from old and new patrons?

A lot of songs, but 3-4 are pretty good...but there are too many. If a couple had been cut, we would have a tighter, better film. We get Brando-looking bikers disco-ing with Cheryl Tiegs-looking station attendants and we keep hoping for that one stretch which can make us say, ""cult film"". Sadly, it just falls short.

Filmed in Orange County, California, we don't get much of that atmosphere.

Having said all that, this picture may not have cohesiveness, but it has alot of heart. Kristen is very appealing; other good performances are by Ken Lerner (as ""Vulture"" PeeWee) and Leslie King as ""[Plain] Jane"". And if you love hot pants and muscle cars...and the Bowery Boys, it is a must!

3095966,4,B0012RCNGE,"First off,a review for this MGM DVD release:
The picture on this release is really nice,and about 10 times better than the old Obsession release which looks like it comes from a used VHS copy. Not only is the picture much improved but so is the audio which has much less hiss than the old release. Those are the pro's of the MGM release,too bad they press these on DVD-R with no extras (besides the original trailer in lesser quality),no chapter menu and bad back cover artwork.

As for the movie-it's pretty much a typical 1970's drive-in feature with cute girls,cool cars,good music and some nudity. A foxy girl's uncle gets sick so she gets her hot girlfriends to help her run his gas station in half cut t-shirts and short shorts. The station starts doing well so naturally the mob run gas station across the street doesn't like this at all and hijinks ensue.
If you enjoy these kinds of films this one is worth watching.

Gas was .79 cents a gallon in this film,which along with the girls and the cars really makes me long for the 70's.",1346025600,,1041,4.473684210526316
3095967,5,B0012RCNGE,I am the director of this movie. From the time of its original release on VHS in 1980.it has been hard for me to enjoy it....bad transfers from from 16mm print...Even the laser disk looked like mud. I obtained a good copy  a few years ago when it showed on cable ....but  the dvd was 1.33 instead of the theatrical release 1.85.....This new release is a perfect transfer in 16.9 (for widescreen tv) with rich colors and  and perfect sharp picture quality that enhances the film. The sound has also been enhanced and adds to the experience...If you like 70s drive in movies that are  funny and kinda sexy..you finally have a copy of Gas Pump Girls that looks even better than it did on screen in this transfer  Joel Bender  PS its the new release DVD from Amazon and mgm ...with the three girls with their back turned bending over a car....and the mgm limited edition logo center top. Now you won't have a heart attack .It looks great. Sorry some of the other reviewers didn't get this transfer first.,1338508800,55,1000,4.497237569060774

I would buy that in an instant.

I live near where this was filmed (even work across the street from the place that serves as the gas company headquarters!) The old gas station still exists but is now a California Recycling Center; the nicer Chevron/Pyramid station was torn down and paved over a long time ago, it's now just an extension of the parking lot!

There's also slapstick as young men take turns squirting each other with automobile fluids, and whacking two old men with boards.

Excellent burlesque entertainment!",1235692800,3,525,4.876404494382022
3330333,3,B0012RCNGE,"I know in the IMDB this movie is listed with a release year of 1979 but plenty of the jokes are from the early 20th century. The story and dialogue read like the producers hired some dirty old men who had once possibly worked in a vaudeville theater, possibly as janitors, to expand a porn script into a full length feature film suitable for drive-in theaters. Seriously, many of the jokes sound like something your creepy Grandpa Joe would tell down t the VFW post when Joey Heatherton would pop in on the Merv Griffin Show.

  That might explain why there are so many dirty old men in the beginning of this movie. In one scene, during a high school graduation ceremony, a bunch of girls have their gowns torn off as part of a prank, revealing their Good & Plenty's. All the guys in the audience start hooting and hollering, even the old dudes. This means that even if they weren't hooting at their topless daughters, they were still hooting at their topless daughters topless best friends, which is still Creep-O-Rama. What would you say to them the next time they dropped by the house for dinner? And Huntz Hall, who plays Kirsten baker's Uncle Joe, looks straight down her top when she comes to his gas station dressed in her prom night finest. Maybe he was checking for melanoma.
  Anyway, the movie is about a gas station run by the aforementioned Huntz Hall, which is going out of business because of a shiny big new gas station, which opens across the street. Huntz has a heart attack and Kirsten and her friends decide to take over running the station in order to keep it from closing. They decide they can beat the new station with all its amenities by sexyin' up their joint. If the story were any thinner you could serve it at McDonalds between two buns and a pickle.

  But you know what? The darn movie grows on you. The jokes eventually become more charming in a corny way. For example, after Uncle Joe's heart attack, his doctor walks away from Uncle Joe's sick bed shaking his head. As he approaches the family, still shaking his head vigorously from side to side, they grow anxious and one of them blurts out,"" Doctor, what's wrong?"" The doctor massages the back of his neck with his hand and says, "" My neck, I've had a terrible crick in it for almost a week"".

  The girls aren't hard on the eyes either. There's Kirsten baker, straight from Norway, who plays the cute girl next door, June, Sandy Johnson, a former Playmate, who plays April, the good natured, curvaceous ditz, Linda Lawrence, who plays the girl who's been around the block more times than the neighborhood dog walker, and Leslie King, who plays the brainy nerd who blossoms under the loving wing of a motorcycle gang member named Peewee.

  That gang is something special. They're a lot less like Hunter Thompson's version of Hell's Angels and more like the bad kids from Grease. While they wear leather jackets, tool around on bad looking choppers and even smoke, the absolute worst thing they do is...litter. Yup they knock over a garbage can, and it's not even a full garbage can at that. After they push it over one piece of crumpled up paper rolls out. However, the Vultures do have the Vulture salute, and their leader is soap opera heartthrob Steve bond, whose hair is the only thing more indestructible than his ego.

  To bottom line it for you, this movie has a few laughs, a few dirty jokes, a bit of naive 70's charm and a little topless nudity. It's probably best enjoyed chillin' with some villains and your beverage of choice as amateur MSTK3 fodder. Conversely it's also a soothing balm for when you're lying on the couch recovering from a night on the town. It's pleasant and undemanding yet just stimulating enough to help keep your heart beating.",1230508800,19,3752,4.576119402985075

3330461,3,B0012RCNGE,"Yes, this one coulda-woulda: with great character actors, Huntz Hall, last seen on screen in 1970 (?), Joe E. Ross, and Mike Mazurki, on the scene (and a nice flowing ""narrative"" by famous New York Dee-Jay Cousin Bruce Morrow, in his ""A.M.""/ ""Cousin Brucie"" mode), a lot more could have been done.

The director and writer try to blend 1959 with 1979 and it really does not work. The Vultures are local bikers who spend most of their time challenging the nice kids, recent High School graduates. They all get together when challenged by the neighboring Gas Station, owned by a decidedly unscrupulous guy, who manages to constantly screw a nice old guy, Huntz Hall, uncle of Kristen Baker. She takes over his job when he can't take the pressure any more.

Kristen recalls that at the Graduation, a prankster tore up the robes of some of the girls and ...the Graduation finale was a strip show!  So why not get that kind of attention...from old and new patrons?

A lot of songs, but 3-4 are pretty good...but there are too many. If a couple had been cut, we would have a tighter, better film. We get Brando-looking bikers disco-ing with Cheryl Tiegs-looking station attendants and we keep hoping for that one stretch which can make us say, ""cult film"". Sadly, it just falls short.

Filmed in Orange County, California, we don't get much of that atmosphere.

Having said all that, this picture may not have cohesiveness, but it has alot of heart. Kristen is very appealing; other good performances are by Ken Lerner (as ""Vulture"" PeeWee) and Leslie King as ""[Plain] Jane"". And if you love hot pants and muscle cars...and the Bowery Boys, it is a must!

(Film quality is okay with me).",1374969600,3,1681,4.677966101694915
3330462,4,B0012RCNGE,The movie was predictably cheesy but enjoyable anyways. It was refreshing to watch something that wasn't as polished as today's movies and that is what gave it its character.  There is one good song in the movie but can't find any information about it anywhere. That's too bad because I would have bought the soundtrack.  Enjoy the movie!,1368489600,5,338,4.810344827586207
3330463,4,B0012RCNGE,"First off,a review for this MGM DVD release:
The picture on this release is really nice,and about 10 times better than the old Obsession release which looks like it comes from a used VHS copy. Not only is the picture much improved but so is the audio which has much less hiss than the old release. Those are the pro's of the MGM release,too bad they press these on DVD-R with no extras (besides the original trailer in lesser quality),no chapter menu and bad back cover artwork.

As for the movie-it's pretty much a typical 1970's drive-in feature with cute girls,cool cars,good music and some nudity. A foxy girl's uncle gets sick so she gets her hot girlfriends to help her run his gas station in half cut t-shirts and short shorts. The station starts doing well so naturally the mob run gas station across the street doesn't like this at all and hijinks ensue.
If you enjoy these kinds of films this one is worth watching.

Gas was .79 cents a gallon in this film,which along with the girls and the cars really makes me long for the 70's.",1346025600,,1041,4.473684210526316
3330464,5,B0012RCNGE,I am the director of this movie. From the time of its original release on VHS in 1980.it has been hard for me to enjoy it....bad transfers from from 16mm print...Even the laser disk looked like mud. I obtained a good copy  a few years ago when it showed on cable ....but  the dvd was 1.33 instead of the theatrical release 1.85.....This new release is a perfect transfer in 16.9 (for widescreen tv) with rich colors and  and perfect sharp picture quality that enhances the film. The sound has also been enhanced and adds to the experience...If you like 70s drive in movies that are  funny and kinda sexy..you finally have a copy of Gas Pump Girls that looks even better than it did on screen in this transfer  Joel Bender  PS its the new release DVD from Amazon and mgm ...with the three girls with their back turned bending over a car....and the mgm limited edition logo center top. Now you won't have a heart attack .It looks great. Sorry some of the other reviewers didn't get this transfer first.,1338508800,55,1000,4.497237569060774
