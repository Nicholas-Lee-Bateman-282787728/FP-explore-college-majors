7820606,4,630202854X,My local video rental store is closing as the owner is retiring and I came across this not on VHS gem. WWE (err WWF?) and Sgt Slaughter meets 80s kids pop americana. Classic and nostaglic. Glad this bit hasn't been re-imagined yet.,1321488000,,231,4.523809523809524
7820607,5,630202854X,"What is not to like. Gi joe the rise of Serpentor. Cobra COmmander is in top form as he tries to stop his bald mad scientist from creating the ultimate Cobra Emperor. Sgt. Slaughter beats...Serpentor and all is right with the world. They almost take over Washington D.C. and the other Cobra officials realize that perhaps Sepentor is a little to unstable.....even more so than Cobra Commander if that is possible. If you are a joe fan or a kid you will love this video. Hey Rhino when the Heck will you put these on DVD?
WE WILL BUY THEM...IF YOU MAKE IT!",1057449600,7,555,4.398058252427185
