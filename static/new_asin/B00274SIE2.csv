Ralph Young and Tony Sandler.  It was good, but we didn't expect so much singing by the guests.
Enjoyable.",1363478400,,218,4.45
8353992,5,B00274SIE2,"To be honest, I haven't as yet viewed this DVD. I often buy DVDs and wait until I'm totally bored out of my mind before I play them. (I find that it's good to have something in reserve this way.) I'm writing this just to point out that Tony Sandler and Ralph Young reunite on this DVD, a fact that was left out in the general item description. So for those Sandler & Young fans looking for the opportunity to actually SEE them as well as hear them perform, well, here it is.
  In addition to Ralph Young, Tony Sandler also plays host to Marilyn McCoo (another favorite of mine) and the Wendy Short Dancers.
  I'm sorry that I am unable to give you any more information at this time. But I have always known both Tony Sandler and Ralph Young to be a class act, exemplifying the highest professional standards. I regret that they have both passed on. I have looked elsewhere and so far have been unsuccessful in finding any other examples of them performing on any video format. So I am happy to report to you that this DVD provides you with that opportunity.",1308268800,2,1057,4.350253807106599
