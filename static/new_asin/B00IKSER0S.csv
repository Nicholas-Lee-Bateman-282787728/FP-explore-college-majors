8643139,5,B00IKSER0S,"I enjoyed this production of Handel's opera which was well done.  Each performer was terrific and Mr. Mehda is an unbelievable countertenor.  It is a modernized production in staging, costume and acting but it was well done and captured the essence of the story without needless distraction or resort to gauche gimmicks as is seen in some modern French productions of Baroque opera.  Handel's score does not need any comment.  Neither does the libretto.  The entire performance was lively, engaging and extremely well done.",1422748800,6,523,5.178571428571429
