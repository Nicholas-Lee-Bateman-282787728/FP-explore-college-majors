8014668,3,B0001M3MZC,So these are not available in widescreen? I'm wondering if the box set of all 5 seasons has Seasons 1 & 2 in widescreen?,1185926400,,120,4.041666666666667
8014669,5,B0001M3MZC,"The characters are so real you can't help stepping in their shoes.  Real, but unpredictable - there is always something new and exciting and morbid and entertaining.  When the last season comes out, I will review all previous seasons to get me up to snuff on all the plots.  That's what I love about purchasing the DVD's.  I can watch them whenever I want.",1142208000,,356,4.515625
8014670,4,B0001M3MZC,"If you enjoy Six Ft. Under, no disappointments here. Just as good as the original run.  However, the DVDs do come in a pop-up sort of display packaging and my Season 2 set was ripped so that there was no pop-up effect. No matter, the DVDs themselves were intact.",1140739200,,262,4.346938775510204
8014671,5,B0001M3MZC,"I look forward to my weekly dose of Six Feet Under with relish! A superb cast! Amazing, haunting, provocative, disturbing, full of humour, life and death! Brilliantly written and very addictive! If you've never seen it, or like me, kept missing episodes, -buy the series and enjoy at your leisure! You're sure to keep coming back for more!",1134259200,3,339,4.862068965517241

8014673,5,B0001M3MZC,"The first two seasons of ""Six Feet Under"" are quirky, unusual, and different - it's not every day that you find a TV show that deals head on with death yet still somehow maintains a playful sense of humor.

As satisfying and rewarding as a good play, film or novel, this series is nonetheless definitely not for the timid.  This disturbing, provocative show often makes its viewers uncomfortable - this is a show that asks its viewers to think and respond, not just sit and be passively entertained.

""Six Feet Under"" is an excellent show in the same league (in terms of the quality of its writing and the acting of its ensemble cast) as ""The Sopranos,"" ""The Wire,"" ""The West Wing"" and ""Deadwood.""",1110067200,6,697,4.604838709677419
