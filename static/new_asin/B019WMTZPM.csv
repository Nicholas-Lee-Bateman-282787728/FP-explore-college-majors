Season 2 was even better all the way, story, cast, anything you can name. So if you thought season 1 was very good, you'll enjoy season 2 even more. I sure am looking forward to season 3.",1462492800,15,294,4.086206896551724

7583774,4,B019WMTZPM,"The Last Ship reminds me of a movie I saw a long time ago when I was young, Stanley Kramer's 1959 classic film On The Beach, adapted from the book of the same name by Nevil Shute.  In that film, Gregory Peck played the captain of a lone US submarine that goes to Australia, searching for some possible hope of survival in the aftermath of a nuclear war.  It's a great film, but depressing as their search for hope ultimately proves futile.  The Last Ship, while similar in the basic setup and set in what is our near future, takes a very different approach.  It involves a destroyer instead of a sub and a global pandemic instead of nuclear radiation, but more importantly there is hope, problems can be solved, and we can see a future - however harrowing - for these varied and engaging characters.  You definitely have to see the first season though to get all of the plot threads and relationships down, but that's hardly a hardship in this case.

Not a perfect show by any means, and a number of things require considerable suspension of disbelief, starting with how a destroyer like this could realistically keep functioning for very long without the massive support network any modern-day naval vessel would require. And as others have pointed out, neither does it have more than just a veneer of realism as to how such a ship would actually function. But its the characters that engage you and keep you coming back, which is a credit to the writers and actors of the show.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good post-apocalyptic action/adventure scifi series with a naval setting and with personal drama thrown in.",1461974400,21,1630,4.658536585365853

7583840,5,B019WMTZPM,"Boy, a global pandemic sure brings out the worst in people.  Season 2 of The Last Ship starts out running top speed picking up right where Season 1 left off and doesnt let up for a minute.  My review of the inaugural outing of this series described my feelings that the show lagged when the story shifted from ship to shore and in retrospect that may have been unfair.  Theres a large amount of land based action in this season as well but the story doesnt seem to suffer and the suspense doesnt lag.

  This time out we find Captain Chandler (the steely-eyed Eric Dane, a long way from his Dr. McSteamy days on Grays Anatomy) and crew discover that the presumptive government is actually doing nothing to develop a cure and have built an elite society at the expense of other survivors.  They deliberately infect those found unworthy and repurpose their bodies in a way thats not as grim as soylent green but not much better either.  Foiling the elites leader Amy Granderson (the always dependable Alfre Woodard) and rounding up the crew the Nathan James makes way for their homeport in Norfolk, Virginia.  Having a cure developed by Dr. Scott (Rhona Mitra, more on her later) Chandler rallies some remaining air assets to distribute it to labs around the country to start mass production and distribution.  Also, efforts are made to find surviving family members of the crew with mixed results.  Its discovered that theres a much larger population of genetically immune survivors who are being recruited for a cult-like post apocalyptic society who consider themselves chosen and have no interest to develop and distribute the cure.  We also find out about a rogue Royal Navy nuclear sub whos leader is the one building the Immunes new social order.  Naturally he finds the Nathan James and its mission to save the world a threat leading to some high-seas excitement.  Adding to that the Immune leader has found the actual successor to the office of POTUS (#22 HUD Secretary, oddly the same job Kiefer Sutherlands character had in new ABC series Designated Survivor) and has brainwashed him into fronting their cause in America.  Played by Mark Moses who typically is known for roles as weasely husbands (Homeland and Desperate Housewives) or creepy execs (Mad Men) President Michener is a man with some dark secrets haunting him and will take some persuading to realize hes being manipulated.

  The skipper continues to put himself in harms way a lot but thats nothing new and occurs in real life.  Maybe not now as much but looking back at WWII you had guys like USMC legend Chesty Puller whose command post was usually behind enemy lines as an example.  In the bonus features the show runners provide some back story on Chandler that hes supposedly a former Navy SEAL by way of explaining some of his daring do.  Not sure of the legitimacy of that career path from SEAL to surface warfare command but I notice he never wears the trident pin which seems odd.  If I was ever awesome enough to qualify as a SEAL Id have that thing surgically implanted on my chest.  Regardless, the show continues to have some clich moments and can be overly sentimental at times but not enough to ruin it for me; it cant be non-stop action all the time so these moments let you catch your breath.

  We are introduced to two newbs who are drafted into the crew this go round, both special operators who were in an international training program in Norfolk when the balloon went up.  One is Australian SCPO Wolf Taylor (Bren Foster whos an accomplished MMA fighter and Tae Kwan Do world champ) and female Israeli commando Lt Ravit Bivas (Inbar Lavi); both are professional butt kickers and augment the shore recon Vulture Team nicely.  Theres a fight sequence on a hospital ship where Wolf disarms three bad guys thats right out an early Bourne movie- youll have to watch in slow motion to catch all the moves.

  Dr. Scott finds a way to make the cure shes developed contagious and easily passed through contact or breathing on someone just like a common cold.  How she accomplishes this however pushes the ethical envelope to extremes and seems out of character for her.  The shows last episode closing scene would seem to spell the end for her and will no doubt trouble many fans.  Not sure if Ms. Mitra wanted off the show as some internet rumors intimate or it was just the direction the writers chose to pursue but a controversial move.

  Bonus features include a part called Exclusive Look with a section titled Enlisted Men but its about 2 of the officers and Wolf (an NCO).  It would have been nice to feature some of the cast portraying the petty officers and seamen.  Charles Parnell does an excellent job as the ships senior enlisted member CMC Jeter and would have been worth profiling.  Otherwise there are some engaging behind the scenes looks at the season and interviews with cast and production staff that are worth watching.

  The shows airing a third season and has been renewed for 10-episode 4th and 5th seasons so clearly it has a following.  There are some haters to be found in on-line reviews and chat pages about The Last Ship.  These folks are mostly Navy veterans who have nit-picking issues about technicalities or science types wanting to debate biochemistry errors most viewers wouldnt notice anyway.  Military dramas always draw these critics, every fighter pilot I ever met hated Top Gun and JAGs despised A Few Good Men but most people found these films highly entertaining and The Last Ship is no exception.  Michael Bay knows how to do action pictures and this series demonstrates his skills at their best.  Sign me up for more!",1486425600,2,5653,4.720408163265306

7583981,3,B019WMTZPM,"The Last Ship continues on with the scenario at the end of Season 1, then becomes another similar storyline to the first season where instead of the Russians, this time it's a coupe of Irish brothers who have taken over a submarine when everyone else who wasn't immune to the virus died.  They have a vision to rule the world, and ensure the master race (the immune people) are the only ones left standing.  We don't get a lot of detail but apparently they already achieved this in Europe, now they want America, well one brother does, the other is content with Europe and is just tagging along complaining all the time but to wussy to do much about it.  Of course the crew of the Nathan James aren't going to stand by and watch this unfold, which of course makes them enemy number one.

For me I just found each episode too predictable with Season 2 to really be enjoyable.  You could tell what was going to happen in each situation, or in regards to a character, or when they were interacting with someone else.  The acting is probably a little better than the first season though now the actors have a season under their belts.  There's a massive inconsistency with the enemy's combat skills though, when we first encounter them when the Nathan James crew are exploring another ship, they are top highly skilled fighters, then when we next do they are bumbling fool types who are easily dispatched with guns or in hand to hand combat.  There's also plot holes such as at one time it seems everyone in a scene is doomed while on an oil rig, they specifically state they cannot land a helicopter to save them, then the next second after a fade to black screen (obviously designed for commercials) everyone is on board that helicopter.

Overall if you got caught up in the plot of the first season it's worth watching to see that play out,but really it's nothing great and still scream Navy recruitment video, probably even louder than the first season.",1469577600,,1953,4.557142857142857

This show is so good on so many levels.  I'm not in a chatty mood but I just wanted to post a little something to say that this show keeps blowing my mind.  Truly exceptional and totally entertaining.  Keeps getting better and now I can't wait until I can watch Season 3!

7584091,5,B019WMTZPM,"Hardcore is the first word that I would use to describe season two of ""The Last Ship."" I absolutely loved it even more so then season one due to the narrative and the character development. I will start off with the story which takes immediately after the grim ending of season one. I will not spoil it but things aren't great on the Nathan James. The story is Incredible and if I say anymore it will be giving away spoilers but trust me it is rad. I will follow up with the acting which introduced some new characters including Lt. Ravit Bivas played by Inbar Lavi and her brother figure SCPO Wolf Taylor played by Bren Foster. I will say they did Phenomenal in selling their performances and the rest of the original cast did Awesome especially since we now got to invest more time with them in this Universe. The action was Insane and that is the only word I could use. They have been cranked to 100 since last season and it definitely shows especially in the palpable tension filled scenes with the ship battles. I mean they spared no expense for the battles that ensued both on and off the ship. I will move onto the cinematography and it was Beautiful with every shot being executed just right and leaving you on the edge of your seat. The backdrops were just as Gorgeous. I will close with this and that is that season two was a definite winner and even though there is a ton of action there are also some extremely sad moments that I even shed a tear for which is rare. I would check this show out immediately because season three airs next Sunday on June 12th. The 1st and 2nd season are on HULU or you can buy them to support the team so that they can hopefully renew it for a fourth season. Thanks and have a blessed day.",1465084800,3,1732,4.299694189602446

7584115,5,B019WMTZPM,"I enjoyed the first season of ""The Last Ship"" and was not disappointed watching Season 2: Suspenseful, well plotted, and well acted, this is great storytelling.
I know there are those that disagree, complaining that the show isn't realistic enough to suit their taste, but I would remind them that this is not a documentary such as ""Victory at Sea"" or the kind of program you are likely to see when tuning into The History Channel. It's fiction and, as such, its main emphasis is on the characters who must confront problems, solve them, and then move on to the next problem. That is the essence of good storytelling; the writer's ability to place his or her characters into situations that provide us with enough dramatic tension to engage our minds and our senses.
The virus that wiped out much of humanity in Season 1 can be cured, thanks to the scientists aboard the USS Nathan James, but they and the ship's crew soon learn that not everyone wants it distributed. They learn, in fact, that some of those who survived might be an even bigger threat to humanity's survival than the virus.
Dealing with themes as diverse as eugenics, religious fanaticism, loyalty, betrayal, retribution, and the consequences of fear-based decision making this season's episodes are even more harrowing than those in Season 1. In Season 2 the crew of the Nathan James must fight enemies that are more powerful than those they faced in the first season, and in some cases much more ruthless. They suffer losses of their own in the process and must also cope with their grief while, at the same time, continuing their mission. Not an easy task and not something that many people can truthfully say they would be able to do, but that's what makes soldiers, sailors, Marines, and Air Force personnel different from those who have never sworn the oath, put on a uniform, and did what their country asked of them.
In my opinion, this is an excellent television program and well worth watching.",1463875200,7,1972,4.752186588921282

7584118,5,B019WMTZPM,"WARNING: SPOILER I really enjoy this show. It has plenty of action, the characters are well developed and most of the action is plausible. As and obsessive Anglophile, it was hard to watch ships from our two countries fighting against each other. However, just as the series shows elements of American forces (Md. State Police) going rogue, the same could happen with a British nuclear sub. The show makes you question whether the military would be something the people could depend on for help in an apocalyptic setting, or would elements of it go rogue. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell posed this question in LUCIFER'S HAMMER also. It is food for thought. I just wish the opponent was from another nationality. In a way though it is a compliment to the Royal Navy in that although these guys went rogue, they are tough, smart and fearless. I loved season 2.",1463356800,2,858,4.726666666666667

8746084,5,B019WMTZPM,"Season 2 of The Last Ship does not disappoint at all. Yes, the show is fiction but we get to learn more about the characters and what they have to cope with. We have a new enemy, that is people who were immune from the virus and they have an idea on how to take over the world and we meet them in the US and the lengths they will go through.

At home, Chandler picks up two new crew members, an Australian & an Israeli who is both Special Forces stationed at Norfolk. We learn something interesting from the Israeli female soldier that surprises her (and us), namely that you would think that humanity would have stopped fighting each other in a post virus world but that didn't happen, if anything the fighting amongst people only intensified as we see mans evil.

The Australian turns out to be a martial arts expert in real life and the fights involving him are very well choreographed. We learn later that the producers added punching sounds based on what they thought were hits, but in reality were cuts inflicted on others, so they had to go back and re-edit the sound.

We learn something about Rachel and how she decides to seek retribution against the one man that was responsible for killing 5 Billion people.

The US is struggling but there is apparently more trouble brewing that I am sure well see in Season 3. I did not like it when one of the central characters was killed off. At times I thought I was watching 24. Yes, its fiction but I don't think that Chandler and the Nathan James can rest just yet.

The ""Special Features"" were done very nicely. We get a lot of back story that we would otherwise not get.",1534464000,,1626,4.370860927152318
