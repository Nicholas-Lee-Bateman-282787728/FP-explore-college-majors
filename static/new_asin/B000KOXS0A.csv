2696684,5,B000KOXS0A,"Chava is an 11 year old boy growing up in dire poverty in 1980's El Salvador. His family's situation is made even worse because of the civil war that is ongoing between the leftist FMLN guerrillas and the right wing military government of El Salvador. Chava is actually scared of turning 12 because he knows the military will then coming looking to recruit him - as the brutal thugs in the army forcefully enlist kids at this age to fight the guerrillas. Soon Chava's town is caught in the crossfire of the war and his family is forced to escape. After turning 12 Chava is brought into the guerrilla army by his uncle but finds himself unable to kill other child soldiers such as himself. He then flees again and is eventually re-united with his mother who pays to have him smuggled into the United States.

It's hard to imagine a movie making a more powerful statement about the tragedies of war than this one. It's also depressing to think about how our American tax money was being spent in the 80's to fund and train the brutal militaries of El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Of course, now billions of our tax dollars are being wasted to inflict similar suffering on innocent people in Iraq.

When will our government stop behaving like imperialist bullies and turn our ""swords into ploughshares""? The world, including lots of people like Chava and his family, is waiting.",1201392000,5,1381,4.679012345679013

2696688,5,B000KOXS0A,Like many i have parents who are from el salvador. I was lucky to be born here in Ca. I saw this movie a couple of years ago at the palm springs internation film festival. I was lucky enough to view the movie and have Q&A w/the director and the man who this story is about. My mom cried and it reminded her of my dad's story. It doesn't matter if u don't understand the language its so powerful and moving. It just shows how the U.S gov't gets involved in things it shouldn't.and own up to the fact they messed up in this siituation!!,1186704000,3,534,4.095238095238095

This movie brought me to tears as my dad remembers hiding down the well, so the guerilla warriors wouldnt find him. My mothers tells of not sleeping because she was afraid the guerilla or guardia civil (u.s. backed military) would break in and rape all her 5 sisters, mother and grandmother. I couldn't visualize in my mind how bad it was until I saw this movie. I recommend it to those who have salvadorean roots or just to the general public.

2696691,5,B000KOXS0A,"""Innocent Voices"" is one of those films that simply blows you away with its incredibly moving story, great acting, directing, and cinematography. I had the privilege of seeing this film at Talk Cinema, where you see films in theaters on Saturday or Sunday morning weeks or months before they are released -- so there are no reviews to hinder your pure enjoyment of the film. We walk into the movie theater with no idea what we're going to see that morning. The 400 film fans in the theater that sunny September 2005 morning had no idea what to expect from this ""Innocent Voices"" film which, sadly, got virtually no theatrical distribution in Chicagoland.

I'll not repeat the summary of the film that others have posted here. It's the film's impact that reflects so well on the power of this medium.

After the closing credits ran, there was total silence in the auditorium, broken only by the soft sound of sobbing all around. And then you realized you were among those in tears. I haven't seen such a reaction to a film since ""Schindler's List."" It is hard to describe the emotional impact of this often funny, but ultimately very moving semi-autobiographical film. It's a shame you can't see in the theaters any more, but I strongly recommend seeing ""Innocent Voices"" on DVD with a loved one with whom you can share a healthy cry at the end. You will be changed.",1170806400,53,1365,4.659751037344399

2696696,5,B000KOXS0A,"How did the Academy not accept this movie to compete for their Best Foreign Film selection?
It's one of those great movies about children dealing with the harsh reality and circumstances of their time,
in this case the war in El Salvador. I find this movie even better than ""Sin Nombre"" movie, this one has truly stayed
on my mind over the years.

Great acting! plot, cinematography.

This movie is based on the true story as told by Oscar Torres (who helped co-write the movie) about the war in El Salvador.
He recounts memories of his childhood during this time and how the military used to recruit children.

I recommend this movie to all my friends, it's just one of those ""great"" memorable movies that anyone would enjoy.
It makes even more sense now due to the politics of today, the war was not too long ago, the consequences remain and the surge of children fleeing danger in El Salvador continues. This movie will be remembered through time due to its topic and real life events.",1451865600,,988,4.6022727272727275

2696698,5,B000KOXS0A,"What an amazing, exceptional movie!  Let me just say that if this film interests you in any way, DEFINITELY SEE IT.  I just watched it for the first time the other night, and was utterly blown away by it.  It's powerful, moving, poetic, deeply impactful, and tremendously thought-provoking.  At times I kept saying to myself, ""is this really a feature film and not a documentary, and are these really just actors?""

Innocent Voices follows Chava, an 11-year old boy in El Salvador during the civil war who is coming up on his 12th birthday, when he faces being conscripted by the Salvadoran army or alternatively put into battle by the guerrillas.  Unfortunately the option of simply being a child and bystander doesn't exist, and the film follows what happens to Chava and his family as the civil war comes to their village.  It's horrifying, and what makes it even worse is that ""Innocent Voices"" is a true story--the story of Oscar Orlando Torres, the co-screenwriter.

The film is flawless.  There's not a wrong note here.  The acting is tremendous, the script is tremendous, and the direction and flow of the film could not be better.  It's truly a masterpiece, and it feels like a heartfelt labor of love.  I don't know what else Luis Mandoki (the director and co-screenwriter) has done, but he has given us the film of a lifetime.  The story is universal.  While it takes place during the El Salvador civil war, there is no doubt it is taking place today in the Iraq civil war, the Syrian civil war, the Yemen civil war, etc.  There are millions of Chavas out there.

Anyone who is decrying the U.S. taking in refugees from the Syrian civil war (or any other conflict, for that matter) needs to see this film.  Not that that will happen, but if our citizens could take a step back and understand the lives others are leading elsewhere, maybe there would be more empathy and kindness shown to our fellow human beings who simply want to live normal, decent lives, and can't do that where they are.  America has historically been a beacon to the world and a place that welcomes the innocent voices, and we need to remember who we are and what we stand for.

I can't recommend this one enough!",1448755200,2,2196,4.61340206185567

2696712,5,B000KOXS0A,"Innocent voices does a wonderful job of capturing the effect the Salvadorian Civil War had on its populous. What is particularly interesting is how the entire body of work rather it be the production or the commentary, seems to transcend into other nations. Consider the fact that it is a Mexican film told from the point of view of a Salvadorian youth who ends up retreating to the United States. The narrative itself is compelling on its own but the underscored theme of Western politics influencing Latin America in a negative way is just as enriching. I found it appropriate how the film subtly pointed out that the child soldiers were being trained by American military personnel. The films hidden political messages allowed me to speculate how the civil war affected El Salvadors national identity, and also drove me to question any benevolent social constructions of American involvement/colonization in Latin America. The typical supporter of American insurgence might say that in funding the Salvadorian government we were just trying to prevent the spread of communism. The film captures the essence of where those funds were going and who it directly affected. In an effort to further political agendas and contain the threat of communism you have ruined the lives of children. Instead of letting El Salvador form its own national identity on its own the western powers that be took the choice away. The film does an excellent job of revealing the ramifications of such ideals. When you really think about it, the practice seems even more sinister for more grotesque reasons. The best way to impact a national identity is to exploit the youth. Hitler knew it and I believe that is what is ultimately being inconspicuously revealed.  This is all implied in the film but being able to form a counter argument against western contemporaries really makes the film provocative. As the conflict unfolds in the film the viewer is further immersed not only in the struggle between the Guerrillas and Military but the struggle Chava is facing. A binary in the film is presented when it comes to what side Chava should stand on. This binary helps with the commentary being given on the senseless ambiguity of war, how it effects the youth, and what it implicates for future generations.",1417737600,,2287,4.971279373368146

2696729,5,B000KOXS0A,"I've never been to El Salvador, so I can't personally vouch for the historic authenticity of the film.  But from all I've ever read, heard, seen - or listened to, from Salvadorans themselves - it's a spot-on reconstruction of its time and place. Screenwriter Oscar Torres chose to film this story around his own life experience and views, which were shared by many.  It's thus as valid an account as Roland Joffe's ""Killing Fields.""  From documentary footage of Salvadorans of the period one reads the same ""Kampuchean"" fear in their faces.

The violence depicted is not excessive - if anything, by all accounts, it's quite restrained.  One reviewer also took the film to task for not being properly anti-war, since it refused to equally condemn both sides.  But in the scene where the neighbor's child is gutshot and dies via a random bullet, it's plainly asserted by Chava's mother that it could just as easily have come from a guerrilla gun fired by one of her brother's armed comrades.

Moreover, in conflict zones like this one doesn't have the option to take the moral high ground and stand aloof; but is rather sucked into it even against his will, as the film shows, in forced support for one side or in expectation of deliverance by the other.  Why wouldn't a family driven to the wall by a very Nazi-like regime look to the FMLN as liberators?  Those supporting present rebels in Syria against an army killing its own people, and condemning Iran for supporting that government, thus have a moral responsibility to extend the survivors of El Salvador the same respect vis-a-vis their murderous government and its American facilitators.

A worthwhile look at a conflict which explores the flip side of US cold war triumphalism.  While rejoicing in the ""fall of the wall,"" remember that it was people like these in this film who really ""paid any price and bore any burden.""",1356566400,,1880,4.807453416149069

2696740,4,B000KOXS0A,"INNOCENT VOICES (Voces inocentes) is a 2004 film from Mexico that relates a true story about he civil war in El Salvador from 1980  - 1992. It is based on a story by Oscar Orlando Torres who co-wrote the screenplay with director Luis Mandoki.  It is a disturbing film in that in addition to relating the terror of living in a land where war raises it's spectral head randomly at day or night, but the focus of the film is on the fact that once boys reached the age of twelve years they were forcibly conscripted to become killing soldiers.

According to the way history books have defined this war, `The Salvadoran Civil War (1980-1992) was a conflict in El Salvador between the military-led government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Mart&iacute; National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition or umbrella organization of five left-wing guerrilla groups. Significant tensions and violence had already existed, before the civil war's full outbreak, over the course of the 1970s. El Salvador's Civil War was the second longest civil war in Latin America after the Guatemalan Civil War. The United States supported the Salvadoran military dictatorship. The conflict ended in the early 1990s. Countless disappeared and More than 75,000 people were killed.'

The story is brought to life by following a young boy Chava (Carlos Padilla in an outstanding performance) whose father left El Salvador for the US in 1980 leaving Chava as the man of the house for this mother Kella (Leonor Varela, in another fine performance) and his brother and sister. The story plays day by day as the bombs and shooting threaten the family and disperses them, results in the death of come of Chava's friends, the influence of Chava's Uncle Beto (Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Yazpik) and his fellow kind guerilla Raton (H&eacute;ctor Jim&eacute;nez), the courage of the village Priest (Daniel Gim&eacute;nez Cacho), and the innocence of the village mentally challenged Fito (Jorge Angel Toriello). It is a tale of fear, devastation, and resilience on the part of Chava's family and fellow villagers. And once again it shows us, the audience, how blindly cruel war is, and that in the end there are no winners.

The photography and musical score enhance the film's message, but it is the brilliance of the acting of this crew of actors that makes the film touch the heart so profoundly. Grady Harp, March 12",1330819200,4,2378,4.979848866498741

2696744,1,B000KOXS0A,"I expected this to be a great movie based on all the five star review. What I found was very disappointing, a movie that could have been directed by Daniel Ortega as a Sandanista propaganda film. First of all, the characters were very one-dimensional army evil FMLA good. Everyone familiar with FMLA, FARC or Shining Path wars knows there's evil on both sides, and it disgusts me to see one group portrayed as evil. I'm sure these atrocities occurred but the ware was 12 years long, and to put atrocity after atrocity make the movie too one-sided. The government troops were all portrayed as shooting kids, kicking priests in the stomach, abducting and raping women off the street, while the communist rebels are on the side of the people, play guitar and sing songs and cooking delicious communal kitchens, and playing guitar to soothe children while bullets fly. The priest gives mass in the streets and condemns the army as souless and evil. I'm sure they were trying to channel Archbishop Romero, but not everyone in El Salvador was on the rebels side right? There was another side, and it won, and El Salvador has peace now. The score of the movie reinforced stereotypes, playing romantic songs when the rebels attack, and scary music when the army attacks. It was like a bad comic book.  Just as the boy is going to be executed by the military for being caught at a rebel camp, the rebels counter attack and save him. I think one has to read between the lines. What was a 12 year old kid doing in the insurgent camp, fighting? probably. You think he's going to write that into the screenplay, or that he was just an innocent kid. Besides that,  the military tactics are childish and I found the movie to be a parody seen through the prism of PC thinking.",1323475200,11,1760,4.584126984126984

2696746,5,B000KOXS0A,"I just finished this beautiful, emotional, heartfelt, tearjerker, wonderful, moving, epic, eye-popping, movie an hour ago. And I had to write a review. Well just simple words to describe the emotions I'm feeling right now after experiencing cinematic images that are so realistic in their depiction of human tragedy and lost innocence during war times, whether a civil war or war for freedom. (War in general is fought in my opinion for selfish reasons).
This Mexican Masterpiece was Mexico's official entry for the best foreign language category, and I can't believe that at least it wasn't among the 5 pictures nominated back in 2005. I had to check the 5 movies nominated that year to compare the competition and the one that won was (The sea inside) from Spain. And all 5 movies that year to tell the truth were with strong human subjects. I saw the Sea Inside a couple of years back and its subject touched me a lot , but after finishing (Innocent voices), I have to admit it's rare to see a gem of artistic quality that personifies reality with magnifying glasses like this. Yes , the story of the brutal civil war that plagued El Salvador for 12 years told through the eyes of an 11 year old innocent child was a bullet in my brain from the instant the bullets started firing over the heads of the family in the story.
It's the story of Chava (who's the narrator) whose father abandoned him and his family at the beginning leaving him feeling the responsibility of the man of the house , taking care of his working mother , little brother and sister. The boy playing Chava was so convincing in all his dramatic scenes that I laughed and cried all the way with him, through his happiness, tragedies and losses.
This movie is the truest example of the futility of any kind of War. That during war time human presence is lost and replaced by fear, that faith may be lost and replaced by anger and hate. War is always fought for personal reasons by higher powers who are really the cowards that manipulate the guns in the hands of the purest human souls.
I may agree that there are very horrific scenes in the movie that will make any human soul tremble with agony due to the graphic images they just watched. But this is the purpose of a masterpiece , to open our eyes and make us remember our nature.
I really do hope this movie will be seen by millions of people. OK there are tons of entertainment in movies , but the true message of cinema are in movies like (Voces Innocentes). A movie that is so touching that is heartbreaking.
Finally , this movie made me cry a lot for remembering all the atrocities committed by fools in our world today in all parts of the globe (Whether in the Middle-East , Africa , Parts of Latin America , and others). The higher power isn't immortal and one day it will die like any living soul , so why should it kill millions of innocent souls in futile wars before reaching its point of dying and not breathing. History of mankind is full of blood and unfortunately this blood will continue to flow till the end of days, because the lesson is never learned and History is pushed aside.
Watch this movie, feel it , and pass it to others. It's a lesson to be hopefully learned.",1320019200,,3213,4.465986394557823

2696751,5,B000KOXS0A,"As an English and Reading Teacher of newcomers into the United States, I find this film not only an OSCAR WINNER but also an awakening film for all teens to view. My reason for recommending this film especially to teenagers is because often times, parents undergo much danger and adventure to get into the United States. Their drive is to offer their own children THE AMERICAN DREAM. Yet, once their children are in the United States, a severe language, cultural, and emotional detachment between the hard working parents and their children grows stronger each and every MONTH. This film Voces Innocentes, awakens the falsely arrogant (ignorant) teen into a setting of reality. A child's narrative is difficult to ignore, especially when it involves true historical events. When viewed by teenagers who still grab a hold of their soul, a re-newed appreciation for ALL of their parents struggles and efforts surfaces into a re-born family concept. More often than not, I've witnessed a drastic change in our youth in a vastly positive manner simply by watching this gloriously produced film. Thank you for creating such a high caliber of a Spanish-speaking film of historical events shared from a little boy's point of view. Bravo!!!",1298678400,,1232,5.073891625615763

I suggest to watch it more than once to catch the most beautiful from this movie.

2696761,5,B000KOXS0A,"""Innocent Voices"" is a film about the harrowing impact of war on a young boy. The simple fact that Chava survives such a grueling childhood is a testimony to the personal courage of Chava himself. Based on a true story, Chava (the eleven year-old protagonist) uses his wits and blind luck to evade being inducted into the Salvadorean army to fight the peasant guerilla rebels.
  The gifted young actor who plays Chava blends a mixture of horror and wonder to illustrate the traumatizing effects of war on his simple, humble life. He plays with his friends, courts a nice girl, and is constantly stressing his mother by wandering away in the middle of military invasions. Tension reigns as a quiet dinner can be interrupted by gunshots cracking and bullets smashing through windows, forcing Chava and his family to lay flat under beds to avoid being blown apart. One touching scene occurs when an uncle (from the guerilla resistance) visits and warfare breaks out just beyond their porch step. The uncle calms the terrified family by strumming a soothing tune on his guitar while laying on his back, shrapnel whining overhead in a disturbing cacophony.
  There are many memorable scenes. A priest tries to maintain his integrity as acts of immorality threaten to overwhelm him. A delayed man with the mind of a child commits an act of bravery that earns a brutal punishment later. Kids run around playing hide-and-seek and then find the game taking a traumatic turn as they flee from rampaging soldiers who want to recruit them. Chava is nearly snared by death many times as he ventures into harm's path in a way that suggests he has lived in a battleground far too long.
  He shows a rebellious spirit by playing a ""banned"" radio song in front of lounging soldiers when he is angry at them. Another time, he plays a disco song and dances in front of them, a scene I found to be funnier and more inspired than the humor in most modern comedies. When he and his friends are playing by the river and a young soldier flaunts his newfound firepower, shooting a rifle into the air, one can sense Chava wondering if he is being a coward by not joining the army. The other kids are both awed and intimidated by the young soldier's brashness. It's a relief that Chava realizes that war will only shatter his life and he resists being ""used"" by men who think it's acceptable to turn little kids into killing machines.
  Some say this film is a piece of propaganda accusing the U.S. of supplying weapons to the Salvadorean army and training their soldiers. Others say it is lopsided, lionizing the guerillas and showing only their point of view. Many will claim it is too depressing. I disagree. There are surprising moments of humor that distract from the horrors of war. Throughout it all, the children only want to live normal lives, and they struggle to retain their innocence by taking the artillery strikes in stride. I don't think the film is propaganda, I think it's educational. If I was an eleven year-old living in El Salvador at this time, I wouldn't care who was right, I would simply want the battle that is tearing my village apart to end. I think the goal it to show Chava's perspective. He endures hardships that rupture the foundation of who's right or wrong and sends out a heartbreaking plea of surrender if this will make the carnage end.",1263168000,16,3348,4.681972789115647

2696763,5,B000KOXS0A,"A simple tale about a slum family in El Salvador during the 12 years civil war from 1980 to 92. Men are either with the army or with the guerilla or dead or two of the three. The demarcation line for `men' is 12 years. Boys before 12 either run away to `safety' with the guerilla or wait for `recruitment' by the army. This is an un-bureaucratic country, so the 12 years line is not taken so literally.

Chava's dad has run away to the States. That is the fourth alternative, which I forgot to mention above. Presumably he obtained a proper work permit and entry visa. He left Chava, 11, as the man of the house, with a brave mother, who works with a sewing machine at home, doing things that Chava tries to sell in town. There is an older sister, who plays along with the 'man in the house' fiction, and a little brother who screams at every nightly battle noise, the stupid brat. When Chava turns 12, the family tries bravely to celebrate his 11th birthday, to no avail.
Did I mention that the `Gringos' are coaching the army and distributing gum to the slum kids?

I remember I traveled in Bolivia in 1980 in some kind of state emergency, forgot what emergency. I remember very clearly that I did not feel so safe with 14 year old soldiers holding the machine guns at the check points.
Child soldiers are one of the sickest aspects of this sick world mess that we have had for a few decades. Or maybe always?

There are so many wars going on: Iraq, Afghanistan, to name a few, that one can have the tendency to forget how children are affected. Although this is a 2005 film, it is excellent because it demonstrates what a war does to a population. It is the story of Oscar Torres who in the film is known by his nickname Chava (narrator), who has learned through the experience of this war how to survive. The film also shows how a country (El Salvador) is destroyed because of a civil war. I will not discuss the reasons as to why the United States got involved in this war, each person must deal with his/her conscious in this aspect. I ask myself (as you might also do the same) should every mother do what Chava's mother did, send their child to another country knowing if they stay they will be killed? She was bringing up three children alone because her husband left her to go to the United States in the middle of the war. Since boys were recruited (as is done in different parts of the world) at the age of 12 to become soldiers in the armed services. After much suffering, she decided to send him to the United States to live with relatives where he had the opportunity to work and study his way through high school and college.

I recognized many faces, not because I know the actors, but because I see from their faces the people who experienced the civil war of their time in their country.  I feel naive about my limited historical knowledge, but I can address the filmmaking, which I think is superb.  I often say that children are magic on-screen and they are so unpredictable and pliable with a good director.  The children in this film (as well as the adults) are worth studying by young actors because they appear to lose themselves in their characters.  The language spoken of course is Spanish with English subtitles that were very well done.  The lush wooded locale was captured beautifully and the devastation caused by the armies was done by a first rate special effects team.  The wardrobe was outstanding and set design very realistic.

The dialogue does not use the terminology used by Salvadoreans; Chava is not a nickname used in El Salvador (Chamba would have been closer).

Great use of children actors but, could not figure the little town, the catholic church, the river, the bridges, etc. I know the catholic church and its priests and nuns were heavily sacrificed because of their ministry, but so were people who did not share the ""revolutionary"" views"". I never saw any child warriors, but did hear of children been abducted by both groups (child soldiers and child guerilleros).

There is no denial that there were a lot of atrocities caused by both parts during the civil war, but the movie is one sided. It would have been nice if both sides at the war would have been portrayed and presented as eloquently as the version the movie pretends to illustrate.

Based on a true story of Oscar Torres, it follows the drama between a forced enlistment at age 12 in the Salvadorian army, or joining up with the rebels.

There is no political rhetoric -- the eleven-year-old, ""Shorty,"" sees his father abandon the family for the United States when the shooting starts. Why is never explained. An uncle helps the family -- only later do we find that he is a rebel leader of a group just outside of town and responsible for a lot of shooting in the neighborhood.

The childish play of Shorty and his friends is against a backdrop of brutality, fighting and murder -- there is no morality -- only the struggle to survive and be a kid.

The movie is a shattering experience of the impact of war on a family and community for the movie viewer. No nobility of sentiment, only the crash and crush of events that Shorty and his family must endure.

Chava follows his Uncle Beto and sides with the rebels, but his mother Kella observes that they, too, conscript their kids. Innocent Voices reinforces the truth that in all modern wars, the biggest losers by far are innocent civilians. Co-writer Oscar Orlando Torres based this award-winning film on his own memoirs.

2696776,3,B000KOXS0A,"Film set in San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador during the 12 year civil war (1980-1992).  Story centers around Chava, a 11 year old boy and his single parent mother who is caring for 3 children trying to make ends meet as a seamstress.  Their father abandons the family leaving the boy to be ""the man of the house.""  The war is between the El Salvadorean army (which is funded and trained by the U.S. government) and the peasant rebels (FMLN) who are aiming to overthrow the government.

The director captures the costs of civil war and specifically so on the mothers who live in fear of losing their children - and the costs on the children - who lose their innocence so early in life and who live in daily fear to see first-hand accounts of rape, violence and killings.  And yet, he nicely intersperses kids trying to be kids - first love, first kiss, playing on the streets.

Amid all of the violence and strife, the story gets a little too tidy for me beyond mid-point of the movie.  Chava escapes recruitment by the government army.  Chava escapes capture by the army yet his friends aren't so lucky.  Chava is able to sneak away from a fire fight when is caught squarely in the jungle between the two warring factions.  Chava is able to locate his mother in the burned out settlement after the entire village is gone.

Terrific cinematography in this movie with some memorable scenes of colorful firefly paper kites against a pitch black sky - torrents of rain falling against metal rooftops and muddy streets - the mother's fear when Chava doesn't come home before curfew - 12 year old boys standing in fear of being ""drafted"" during middle school classes - just to name a view.",1212883200,11,1691,4.547854785478548
2696777,5,B000KOXS0A,"Innocent Voices was a great movie.  The acting was outstanding and the quality of production, superb.  This movie presents one perspective about the civil war in El Salvador as a child relates his experiences. The viewer is able to see what he sees and feel what he feels as an impersonal war encroaches upon his family.  One reviewer stated that the movie takes sides.  I suppose that's somewhat true.  But when a stray bullet causes harm, the child's mother is quick to point out that it could have come from either side and that atrocities have been comitted by both.  Again, this movie shares one perspective and, in my opinion, does nothing to take away from the movie's excellence.  Also I'd like to add.....I thought this movie provided excellent cultural value and awareness.  I had my children watch it (ages 14 &17).  Not only were they thoroughly engaged by the story, but they were able to see how other people live and what type of hardships they endure.  They take their lives here for granted.  Often they complain.  I want them to understand how thankful they should be for the lives of ease they enjoy.  This movie helped to put things in perspective for them.  I highly recommend it.",1211155200,2,1201,4.684210526315789

Numerous awards earned in international festivals. El Salvador in the 80's. Chava lives in a village that lies between the Salvadorian army and the guerrilla warfare. He must hide with his friends when the army starts to enlist by force 12 years old boys. While watching this motion picture, I never had the feeling that it was pro-guerrilla or anti-Salvadorian army. INNOCENT VOICES is simply anti-civilian wars if it absolutely must be anti-something. Seen through the eyes of a kid, any war will seem awful even if it is justified by noble ideas. The director manages to provoke in our heart emotion and empathy and cinema is primarily about this. Masterpiece.",1211068800,7,1045,6.864661654135339
2696779,1,B000KOXS0A,"This is a flawlessly photographed film and had the potential of becoming a great anti-war movie. Unfortunately it is much too obvious that the intent of the filmmakers was not to spread anti-war sentiment. Their intent was to choose sides in the conflict and display one side as completely evil and the other as completely virtuous.

The evil side wields weapons from the evil United States, receives evil training from the evil United States, kidnaps preteen boys from school and makes them wet their pants.  They target civilians, burn down the huts of the poorest, prohibit free expression, deface the church, beat and kill the priest, and  kidnap schoolgirls for gang-rape. They are the horror that strikes in the night and traumatizes the children.  They bring death and destruction over the young and innocent. They even ruthlessly execute helpless little schoolboys.

The guerrillas meanwhile are portrayed as virtuous freedom fighters of Christlike appearance, caring for widows and orphans, playing beautiful music, helping the victims of the evil oppressors, and altogether as downtrodden reasonable defenders of the innocent. Heroic saviors for whom no sacrifice is too great.

This is actually a pro-war movie.  As long as one side is portrayed as virtuous, their battle is justified.  A true antiwar movie has to communicate the fact, that there is evil on both sides and that neither side is justified in their violence and that there is nobody who is completely good or completely bad. In the El Salvador Civil War horrible atrocities were committed by the guerrillas as well.  Their cruelty committed on men, women, and children who did not happen to be on their side could also fill an entire movie.

There is no better way to bypass human critical thinking and directly penetrate the heart with a message, then to deliver it it with gut-wrenching images of suffering children. The makers of this movie had the opportunity to make a great film, but instead they only made it clear, whose side they were on and exploited the power of the agony of women and children to drive home their point. This is especially evident in the execution scene, that induces almost unbearing negative emotional pressure in the viewer and then causes a positive resolution brought about by the guerrillas, thereby leaving the viewer essentially no choice but to join the filmmakers in their position. Cleverly conceived, but completely disappointing. Essentially a propaganda film.",1208217600,16,2478,5.126550868486352

2696781,5,B000KOXS0A,"This is the first movie to ever make me cry. It's about a boy in El Salvador who's life is turned upside down by the civil war and how this boy, his family, and his friends try to survive the atrocities.

It is one of two movies that I want everyone I know to see.  It is a enormously moving look into the ravages of civil war and child soldiers.  It will open your eyes to a whole new world, a moving world of suffering and triumph.
I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in international affairs,history, war, peace, child soldiers, or central American heritage. My only criticism is that the movie does not touch on the issues being fought over, and provides a one sided view.  Again, it brings insight into the possible view of one boy in an international mayhem.  It makes war personal in a way no other movie I have ever seen can do.",1205366400,,850,4.2875

It is a true story, and the lessons are the best when presented by members of that culture.  The 12 year civil war in El Salvador was barbaric with many ironies with contradictions that defied reason.  Evil can be very irrational.  For example, in the scenes at the local school, there are several boys who are - or will be conscripted by both the Army and the FMLN.  Then boys were friends and in the same class, ages 10 -12 will be conscripted in to both the Army and FMLN to both fight and kill each other?!  When the FMLN guerrillas or the Army come into neighborhoods to conscript the boys, they hid on roofs and did not come down until the next day after both had left.  There are some gruesome scenes where boys were captured marched into the woods to be taken down by a river - and executed.  Chava survives, left his home and country to go to the United States.  Then, 6 years later  he was re-united with his brother.  Boy Soldiers are a real societal problem and do exist; indeed they are innocent voices conscripted into tragic situations of war.  This movie is a 5 star portrayal of that reality.  Chava as portrayed by Carlos Padilla was extraordinary.",1463356800,3,1279,4.391489361702128
