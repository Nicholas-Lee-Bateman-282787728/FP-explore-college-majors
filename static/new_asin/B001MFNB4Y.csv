3696834,4,B001MFNB4Y,"As a big fan of the first film ""Waiting"" I have seen the trailer for ""Still Waiting"" and while i don't expect it to be quite as good as the first film, it looks decent, there are quite a few of the orginal cast members still there and the screenplay was written by Rob Mckitrick the guy who wrote the first film, and i don't think he would screw it up that bad, if any, while i don't expect him to outdo himself, i do think this will be funny and i will definently be buying it.",1233619200,3,478,3.9381443298969074

3696889,2,B001MFNB4Y,This movie is ok but it tries way too hard to be the original and it falls way short.  If you have never seen Waiting it might be funnier but then you would miss all the throw back jokes.,1487548800,,187,3.7948717948717947

3696926,2,B001MFNB4Y,Still waiting is okay however the movie is not the same without Ryan Reynolds. You do get to see some of the characters from the first movie however I did not have high expectations since this film is a sequel.,1470614400,,210,4.275
3696927,4,B001MFNB4Y,This movie answers the questions the first movie had put in your mind except what happened to Ryan Renolds character. (Most likely they couldn't afford him) but they could've said what happened to his character. But they didn't. All in all they answered everything else.,1468022400,,270,5.022222222222222

3696933,1,B001MFNB4Y,Total rubbish. A bad attempt to play off the success of the original yet falls short of even being tolerable (cut my pain 10 minutes in).  I think the credits mention Andy Milonakis however I did not wait long enough to see if this was just another con-job play on words simply to get my viewing $.  Even if Andy does actually appear in this flick I don't see how it could do it any good and as for the rest of the cast from the original I think they only appear on the promo pic.,1450051200,,480,3.9895833333333335

3697069,1,B001MFNB4Y,"I really wish I haven't paid to rent this but I guess I can be glad I didn't buy it. The leads in this movie, whose names I can't recall (nor do I care to), had zero charisma and the characters they played were totally forgettable. Take, for instance, the racist guy. Rather than being racist in the style of Archie Bunker, or doing things to demonstrate he's racist, he's shoehorned into scenes and sputters out some unfunny bigoted crap of nowhere. His ignorance completely lacked the context to make it interesting. The manager is played by the poor man's Jason Bateman and is a humor vacuum.

To avoid making this review an epic I'll try to sum up my complaints in short bursts. Numerous scenes are ripped off from the original outright (the passive-aggressive mother of the lead, Cal's bathroom neurosis, the flashing game). Characters from the first movie are reintroduced hastily and quickly ruined. The lead character learns nothing and experiences almost no consequences for the mistakes he makes. I can't remember the name of any character in this movie that wasn't in the original.

Skip this. It's difficult for me to call such a thoroughly mediocre movie bad but I'm going to power through it. This movie is bad.",1396828800,,1225,4.773584905660377
3697070,1,B001MFNB4Y,"I LOVE Waiting... so I was excited to see the sequal.  It was beyond disappointing.  This movie has none of the magic the original had.  The story is weak, there are no laughs and the way they end Dean's (Justin Long) story actually made me angry.  If you want a good laugh just rewatch the first one.  Still Waiting... was 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back.",1396224000,,366,4.246376811594203
3697071,5,B001MFNB4Y,"Loved it. Its stupid funny. Anyone that has ever in their life worked in a restaurant will love the film. They showed more nudity and had more sexual references in this one, always a plus! I liked the part where they kept farting as they walked by some of the rude customers that were eating! Hilarious! And the part where a fly went in the soup and everyone started changing their soup order. Ha ha ha ! lol I would by this or watch again sometime! I thought this wouldn't be that good without Ryan Reynolds in it, but it still was really good or almost better than the first one! You gotta see this!",1394928000,,601,4.234782608695652

3697075,5,B001MFNB4Y,"Seriously, the first time I watched it I wasn't feeling it since it was hard to except the fact that the cast for the most part was totally different. I didn't think the magic could've been duplicated from the first movie, however, this is by far my favorite between the first movie and this one now! I quote this movie all the time. A must see for anyone who has ever worked in the industry!",1369440000,2,392,4.24
3697086,1,B001MFNB4Y,"Why did this get made?  We all understand this was a blatant attempt to bilk fans of the great original movie for money.  However the cast, director, writer, etc. should've stopped the production the moment they read the script.  It simply is one of the worst films ever made.  Even Justin Long is ashamed to have been in it.  Avoid at all costs.",1369180800,,346,4.428571428571429

3697088,1,B001MFNB4Y,"sometimes, sequels are okay, but this one was just awful. If they could've gotten all the original cast members back; it probably would've been okay and/or i wouldn't have noticed the storyline was terrible. The chef, the pee-shy guy, the hostess, and the ANGRY girl(naomi) all appear again. It was almost like they were trying to make everything funny and some parts really didn't need to be. I still like the franchise, but wished i hadn't bought this movie; thinking it would've been as funny as the first one.. sad......",1355788800,2,524,4.833333333333333

3697092,3,B001MFNB4Y,Filled with gross-out humor (not my style) but actually probably not as gross as the original. Several attractive female stars in this production as well. Pretty standard teen humor fare with the feeling  of a production from the late '90s or early 2000s.

Either something is bad wrong with my blu-ray player (it plays every other blu-ray disc I own), or a whole batch of bad blu-ray upconversions were made of this movie and so few people have bought it that they just aren't aware.

3697112,2,B001MFNB4Y,"I'm still waiting for the movie to start. Not half as good as the first one. Crude sexual humor, fart and feces humor, and it really wasn't that funny except for the sour cream Sanchez which I had to explain to my mother.

Brief nudity and you never see the girl's face attached to the Ta's Ta's, which means they were a body stand in.

Outtakes and bloopers were just as bad as the film.",1278633600,,388,4.16
3697113,2,B001MFNB4Y,"This movie has almost none of the magic of the original. The Stifler-esque racist, the butthole cooks, it was just boring. The only two saving graces of the movie were the super-pretty Amber, and Naomi, who's amped up her craziness from the first movie. Reminds me of a crazy girl I know in the Deep South. Otherwise, it was almost unwatchable. Good thing I rented it instead of buying it!",1273449600,,389,4.571428571428571

I doesn't have the twisted charm of the original, but the cast seems to be having a good time. The jokes are gross, the characters aren't as good as the first film, but it is enjoyable for people who like this sort of thing. I have seen this one in the bargain bin, but I don't think I need to own this, I've seen it and I may see it one more time in my life, but that's about it. If you want a lesser version of the first film too watch, maybe you should rent this one?",1270944000,2,562,3.8956521739130436
3697115,1,B001MFNB4Y,"Synopsis: The movie takes place a couple years after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waiting/dp/B000CPH9PM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waiting...</a>&nbsp;took place. Dennis (played by John Michael Higgins) is the store manager for Shenaniganz and is told by his boss Dan (David Koechner) that if he doesn't raise $9,000 by the end of the day, he'll be passed up for a big promotion he's looking forward to. That won't be an easy task as the hot new restaurant in town, Ta-Ta's Wing Shack, has taken a sizable amount of Shenaniganz's business; not to mention their employees as Calvin (Robert Patrick Benedict), Raddimus (Luis Guzman), and Theo (Max Kasch) defected to Ta-Ta's from Shenaniganz. Gone are most of the familiar faces except for Naomi (Alanna Ubach) and Nick (Andy Milonakis); now they've been replaced by an all-new waitstaff, bar staff, and kitchen staff. Dennis tries his best to motivate the staff to raise the money while Calvin's enjoying life; transforming from a neurotic waiter into a restaurant manager who's a ladies man. Will his transition last? Will Dennis and the waitstaff raise the money necessary for him to get the promotion? Justin Long has a cameo as Dean, Chi McBride has a cameo as Bishop, and Adam Carolla appears as Ken Halsband, motivational guru.

While direct-to-DVD movies aren't necessarily critically-acclaimed, I was really disappointed with how little of the previous movie's legacy this retains. Some of the jokes in the film called back to the first Waiting... film, but then just fumbled the joke or weakly carried it out. While some of the characters improved, most actually devolved since the last film (most notably Justin Long's character) and just left the film to be carried by weak jokes, weak developments, and a not-ready-for-prime time cast that seemed like weak substitutes for the cast of the original film.

It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen and there were a few laugh-out-loud moments, but there were too many inconsistencies for me to give it a higher mark. Recommended for the fans of the first film only; I doubt anyone else would be able to get into the story otherwise; much less get whatever humor's in the story.",1265414400,5,2230,5.26123595505618
3697116,3,B001MFNB4Y,"I watched Waiting when I worked in a resturant and that it was a decent comedy. It reminded me of the place I work expect messing with the food, that was sick. Still Waiting still has a few of the lesser known actors in this movie but it just wasn't too funny. I rolled my eyes when I saw Justin Long, I don't know why i'm probably sick of seeing this guy on mostly every film. While it wasn't really funny I still enjoyed it. Worth checking out once even if you haven't seen the first movie.",1261958400,,492,4.082474226804123
3697117,4,B001MFNB4Y,"This is far better than the horrible comedy sequels ""Dumb and Dumberer"", ""Next Friday"", ""Ghostbusters 2"", and the list goes on. Those disasters made it to theaters. At least ""Still Waiting"" humbly went straight to DVD.
If you enjoyed ""Waiting"", give this movie a fair shot! It has many of the same actors from ""Waiting"" and they stick true to their original character they portrayed. Ryan Reynolds is missing, (like no Chris Tucker in the ""Friday"" sequels), but this other guy does pretty well playing a cocky, likable, potty-mouthed womanizer! The Adam Corrola segments are hilarious!
I recommend the first movie be viewed before this one if you have not seen it. I don't understand all the hatred towards this movie. Maybe I am just simple-minded and easily amused. I always start watching movies at 40 minutes before 5pm.

Did you laugh along with the characters as they struggled with the brain-dead morons who ate dinner at Shenaniganz?  Did the constant food tampering simultaneously abuse your abdomen by causing you to bust a gut laughing while getting sick to your stomach?  If you answered yes to any of the above, you'll love Still Waiting.

Basically, most of the characters (minus Anna Faris) returned for the raunchy sequel, and thankfully Ryan Reynolds was dumped for someone a little less Ken doll, and a little more Stiffler.  If there's going to be an entire movie of genitalia jokes, food terrorism, and sexual innuendo, then why try to pretty it up?

The new store manager, Dennis (Higgins), has to reach his sales quotas to be considered for district manager, and he's presently in a real bind.  With his superiors breathing down his neck, he's forced to compete with a Hooters-themed restaurant next door named Ta-Ta's that has stolen his best waitresses, and is referred to as a ""Gateway Job"" towards a stripper pole.  Prodded by an aggressive womanizing manager, Calvin (Benedict)- who has made a complete 180 from the original - and d@#k-showing game originator Raddimus (Luis Guzman), who tries to start a new game with the girls, Ta-Ta's is making Dennis' goal impossible.

Naomi (Ubach) is still as vulgar as ever (but has exquisite breasts); Nick (Milonakis) is still a fat wannabe; Bishop (McBride) still manages to dish out unsolicited, unorthodox, sage advice; Dan (David Koechner) is still hilarious as the pathetic manager who wants to fit in; and the number of hot women increases exponentially from the original.  With a few surprise cameos and enough new jokes to bring about guffaws (look out for the handful of sour cream), it's not as hilarious as the original, but it's still lowbrow funny at several moments.  Like Nick and T-Dog's tradition of closing credit raps, I liked the sequel, but it just didn't flow as well as the original.",1240444800,8,2104,5.288288288288288
3697132,3,B001MFNB4Y,"This direct to DVD sequel to Rob McKittrick's surprisingly good Waiting may not feature Ryan Reynolds or Anna Faris, but it remains a decently funny gross-out sequel that manages to retain the spirit of the original.  McKittrick is only writing and producing this time around, with John Michael Higgins starring as a Shenanigansmanager looking to move up the corporate ladder.  He's joined by Steve Howey as a racist sex hound, and a returning Alanna Ubach as well.  They're competing with a Hooters-like neighboring restuarant (run by a returning Rob Benedict as Calvin, who has since transformed quite a bit since the first film), and the usual bit of gross-out antics ensue, even though they're definitely not quite as funny as they were the last time around.  More familiar faces are around as well, including Luis Guzman, Chi McBride, David Koechner, Andy Milonakis, and cameos from Justin Long and Vanessa Lengies.  All things considered, Still Waiting could have been much worse, but it manages to coax enough laughs and have enough of McKittrick's musings to make it a worthy enough sequel.",1240358400,,1098,5.0777777777777775
3697133,4,B001MFNB4Y,"this was a bit different than Waiting, but still a really good movie.  i don't know why some people are giving it only 1 star.  sure, Ryan Reynolds and Anna Farris aren't in the movie, but Still Waiting is most definitely on par with the original.

a solid comedy.

3697134,3,B001MFNB4Y,"First thing out I want to say this is much better than other direct to DVD sequels. Sure the ""big names"" weren't here but why would they be? In the storyline two years have passed and it's not unrealistic in two years time to have people move on or change roles in a work environment. How many direct to DVD sequels get as many of the orginal cast to return as this did? I actually can't think of any. Alanna Ubach once again brings big laughs as Naomi. If you liked the first (and like plenty of T & A) check this out. Worth it just to see what happned with the returning cast.",1237680000,4,578,4.078947368421052
3697135,1,B001MFNB4Y,"Bad, just plain bad, I did not even laugh once. The first flick Waiting was very good, funny & witty even though it had no plot it worked very well with the funny bone. The original actors in Waiting had the chemistry to play off of one another & delivered the laughs. Still Waiting just was plain flat & boring. Even with some of the original cast members that were in Still Waiting, they did not strike any chemistry with its fellow actors. It would have been nice to continue the original cast at Shenaniganz instead at the Ta Ta's restaurant. I could think of a million other shenaniganz the original cast could have dipped into instead of this bad attempt of a sequel. Nice try but 2 bloody thumbs down.

I am a waiter, and this movie is closer to the truth. :) ""At least they are not picking on me."" God Bless Nick and T-Dog.",1235260800,4,242,3.764705882352941
3697138,1,B001MFNB4Y,"Anyone who has commented that this movie is even remotely as good as the original movie Waiting is either lying or out of their mind.  This movie was completely terrible in every way a movie can be terrible.  Also, there are many moments where characters are unbelievably racist but you are supposed to let it slide because the character is ""just kidding"" and ambiguously learns a lesson at the end.  There is an inexcusable re-occurring joke that waiters get upset because black people are seated in their section.
Besides racism the movie is permeated with completely vulgar moments for the sake of vulgarity without any humor.  Lastly, fans of the original Waiting will recognize the writer of both films as a formerly pathetic waiter now turned Ta-Tas (Hooters) restaurant manager.  His role as a ladies man is about as believable as Billy Crystal in the role of The Terminator.  This movie is absolutely nothing but a cash in on the popularity of the original film with nothing new to offer, nothing gained from watching, and I can't recommend ignoring this release enough.",1235260800,2,1078,4.895604395604396
