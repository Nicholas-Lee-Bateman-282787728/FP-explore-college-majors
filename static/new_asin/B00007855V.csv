7974326,3,B00007855V,"IMO this is the funniest episode of the MBB series.
It's Christmas time for Gary, Tony, Debra and Dorothy and it contains some of the funniest things I have ever seen them do.
This was the episode that got me started on watching MBB and I haven't seen a funnier episode in the series since.

But, why is this episode not included in the box set or as an addition to one of the other complete series? Is it a different supplier selling it or something? My OZ box set has seasons 1 to 6, and the Last Orders DVD, it says it contains the whole series.. but it did not include this episode.. it stands here on it's own.. is that because it's a different company or channel selling it, or because the funniest episode ever needed to be on it's own disc? But then why only put one episode on a disc, and not include any bonus features? The price is cheap, but couldn't they have just packaged this with the rest of the series? The package states it shows bloopers and scenes not previously seen on TV... maybe to the date this thing was released? But the show doesn't feature any extra bits, and the bloopers may not be shown in the order they are on this DVD, but they are the same bloopers seen as bonus features on the rest of the series!",1424995200,,1235,4.210970464135021
