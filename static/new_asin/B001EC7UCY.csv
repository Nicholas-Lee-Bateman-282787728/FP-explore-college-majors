So when do we in the states get a Region 1 version to purchase?",1424044800,,147,3.9
8297572,3,B001EC7UCY,"At the very outset, the hero of this grade B film, a man of Polish descent, informs viewers that he is an aggressive cop and that he does not want his brother to be a cop because he is not sufficiently aggressive. And we wonder, what is his real reason for trying to persuade his brother to abandon his desire to be a cop? Did he see something wrong in the force? Is it because he does not want his brother involved in something bad?

 His brother is shot in the second scene and he swears revenge. Since the killer is Polish and has flown off to Poland, our hero pursues him. He locates him at an outdoor bizarre. There is a gunfight. Bystanders are killed. The market goes up in flames. But the killer, as we can expect, flees safely.

 Our hero finally finds him and kills him, but then discovers that the killer was involved in illegal activity. He decides to stay, uncover what is going on, and destroy it. He becomes fascinated by a girl. She turns out to be the daughter of a suspect. She is also being romantically pursued by a Polish senior detective who does not like having our hero as a rival at all.

 Will our hero uncover the crime? What is it? Is the father a criminal? Is the detective involved? Who will win the girl?",1289779200,,1235,4.256410256410256
