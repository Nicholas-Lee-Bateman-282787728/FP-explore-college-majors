8045293,3,B000777UDG,"This is perhaps one of those films that hasn't carried well over time, or is better suited to the stage. Richard Harris seems somewhat miscast, and breathless. He doesn't seem to inhabit the role like he did in Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. Perhaps it was partly the mood I was in. However the accents are so broad, and so little time is spent setting the scene, that I found myself struggling to make the connections, and also seeing anything redeeming in a rather dismal tale. Add to that that it is a thinly disguised makeover of King Lear, with two rival daughters and their partners and an independent yet trusted youngest (third) daughter,and you have one very curious film. Beautifully shot and very moody, but the sound man went on holiday I think. Worth a look but I have only watched about one quarter of it when my concentration wavered (the kettle boiled, perhaps) and I forgot to come back to the film. It is a bit like watching a coffin being opened and everything being rather musty and lifeless...It's watching films like this that makes me greatful for the advances in cable television and the remarkable product that cable companies are putting out to eventually be purchased on DVD. Give me Deadwood, or Sons of Anarchy, or True Blood, or Breaking Bad, or Mad Men, and so on, any day. Run of the mill crime sagas have had their day, Boardwalk Empire a notable exception.",1308700800,,1388,4.669387755102041
