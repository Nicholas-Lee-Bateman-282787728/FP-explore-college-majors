8691264,4,B00QH23QV0,"Originally filmed in 1998 Sex, Love and Fantasy has just recently been released on DVD. This intellectual comedy has a great ensemble cast.  Single youth, married middle age, and the wisecracking wisdom of maturity are each represented and are universally recognizable. Shea Whigham is a hoot and the perfect contrast for the urban professionals. How many historical, literary, and pop culture references will resonate with you?",1423872000,,428,5.484848484848484
8691265,5,B00QH23QV0,"It was cool to see Shea in a comedy.  He and ""Emily"" were histerical.  Must have been his first big film.",1421625600,,105,3.9523809523809526
