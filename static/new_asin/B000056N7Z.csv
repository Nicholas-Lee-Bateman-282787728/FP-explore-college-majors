7932213,5,B000056N7Z,"My daughter's sitter informed me that this was her favorite tape.  We don't really watch Barney that much, but I believed her, because when we passed the video in the store, purple box all aglow, she started to cry and point for it.  It wasn't until I sat thru the video with her that I saw her level of devotion.  She watches the screen like they were showing the moon landing.  The decription above is pretty much on target.  Where do they get those dorky kids, anyhow?  The set is cheap and the banter chessier.  But my little one just thinks it's the greatest thing ever.  There's even an intermission on the tape, during which she cries (hasn't grasped the concept of ""rewind"" or ""time out"" yet).  Like I said, you'll think your brain is melting away, but for 60, YES 60 minutes of free parent time, ""Barney's Musical Castle"" is heaven sent.",986256000,10,846,4.477124183006536
7932214,5,B000056N7Z,"I borrowed this video from a friend and have to go buy it because my toddler sings long with Barney and sits throught the whole.  It is a taping of a live performance somewhere, but it very well done.  I recommend this video to any parent whose child loves the songs that Barney sings.  There are also a section with a few Wiggles' songs following Barney's performance.",983404800,5,369,4.477611940298507
