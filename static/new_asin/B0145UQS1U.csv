8729757,5,B0145UQS1U,"What can I say? I'm addicted to B Westerns and Gene made some of the best, mainly those from Republic Pictures. Some of the Columbia's are fine, some not. The four in this set are all early Republic's and a lot of fun...if you're not looking for cinema classics. But, of course, there are those of us who DO consider these classics. Grab a bowl of popcorn, sit back and for a short time enjoy programmers made for a simpler time. Just one man's opinion. *sigh*",1466812800,,460,4.3604651162790695
