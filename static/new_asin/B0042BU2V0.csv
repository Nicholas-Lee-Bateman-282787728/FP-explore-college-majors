4249179,5,B0042BU2V0,This review is for all of the people who want this in the USA--to watch it on a Region One DVD player. Thanks!,1319241600,22,110,3.8260869565217392
4249180,5,B0042BU2V0,"at least to me, this is one of the funniest, if not the funniest, show on pbs.  i laughed so hard that my daughter asked me to tone it down a bit so she can hear it.  i think i almost wet my pants.  i love clive swift from ""Keeping Up Appearances"" however his room mate Tom is simply hysterical.  his British accent alone is so funny sometimes i miss the joke but the look on his face when he tells it is funny enough.  if you are into British sitcoms this is the cream of the crop.  enjoy",1306972800,18,489,3.888888888888889
8413421,5,B0042BU2V0,"Please, we were treatede to about 6 or so of these shows on our local PBS channel in the US.  Unfortunately we no longer receive it and it is NOT listed for viewing in Canada or the US.  Please, please, is there any way this will soon change?  We  love British comedies and are frustrateed that we cannot get them here.  Thank you...Stuart Good",1436572800,,344,4.3125
8413422,5,B0042BU2V0,"Why is it so difficult for those of us who love English tv and movies to get Region 1 access? In this day and age of technology, can't Amazon convert region 2 discs to region 1 disc format for those of us who do not have a multi region dvd player?!?!",1411689600,3,250,3.9215686274509802
8413423,1,B0042BU2V0,",,,this price is WAY inflated.  I could see paying as much as $24.99 for this first season, but anything above $50 is highway robbery.  I'll just keep watching the episodes on YouTube.",1403481600,,184,4.71875
8413424,5,B0042BU2V0,"I am particularly fond of BBC comedies and this has my very favorite British actor, Roger Lloyd Pack and the lovely bubbly receptionist from Doc Martin among others. The stories are great fun and the contrast in the housemates is done very believably and not exagerated like some US shows.  It is no problem with the non-usa format - that must have been some sneaky idea of the film producers as all you need is to purchase a no region dvd which I found much cheaper on Amazon.",1391731200,4,477,4.420454545454546
8413425,5,B0042BU2V0,"If you like ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and ""the Vicar of Dibley"" you probably LOVE ""The Old Guys"".  We need the USA format DVDs.",1374710400,2,126,4.478260869565218
8413426,5,B0042BU2V0,i love this show. these guys are really funny. i hope they will release in usa on dvd player we can use. i used to watch these shows every sunday on pbs and they are a delight!,1360195200,,176,3.7837837837837838
