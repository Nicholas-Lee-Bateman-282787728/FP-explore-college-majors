8268166,2,B001811ROI,"What we have here is a triple loser. I bought this to see King of Marvin Gardens again after many years. It was definitely not worth it. As for the other two, let's just say Nicholson has been seen to much better advantage elsewhere.",1442188800,,233,4.318181818181818

8268169,1,B001811ROI,"I ordered the triple Feature including the following:Something's Gotta Gve, Anger Managements, and the King of Marvin Gardens.

However, the movie, Anger Management made me very angry because it is will NOT play! It stays on the menu page, and nothing I do will change it. The other two are fine.

This is not something I wanted to place on the public page, but could not find how to send a private note to the company.",1372809600,3,419,4.5

8268171,1,B001811ROI,"I know I'm just going to love this movie as I've seen it before and it's just great!!! That's why I bought the DVD.. However, this is a triple dvd of Jack Nicholson and the one I wanted to see the most was Somethings Gotta Give and that DVD is cracked and can't be watched!!!  I would love to have a new one sent to me asap, but I'm having difficulty in returning the product!!  I keep going to the return information and I see what it tells me to do, but it won't let me put in the reason for the return!!  Maybe you can help me, I hope!!  It says I'm suppose to print a lable and also get authorization, I can't see how to do it!!! I also don't know if I'm suppose to send all three back??  Help, maybe I could talk to someone on the phone, but I can't seem to find a phone number in all of the information on the computer???  Thank You,  Bev V.",1342828800,2,847,3.88953488372093
