8403104,5,B003R2YVQ2,I remembered watching this show as a teen while babysitting and so I bought it for my daughter who just loves it. Its a very sweet show with a lot of good growing up lessons but its generally not heavy handed about it. The puppets are Henson-esque and don't come of creepy or scary at all.
