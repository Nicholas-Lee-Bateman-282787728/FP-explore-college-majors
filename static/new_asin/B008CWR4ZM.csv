8526845,3,B008CWR4ZM,"The music and the performers are stunning but the set is dreary and depressing, with few changes and takes away from Cavalli's important and gorgeous music. How long would anyone want to continue looking at a huge dead deer carcass? It's hard  to believe that William Christie would like this production design. Cavalli is always wonderful and ought to be staged elegantly and beautifully.",1507852800,,389,5.078125
8526846,5,B008CWR4ZM,"This is superb in every way.  The mezzo Didone, who is better known in her native Italy than here, is a revelation--she makes this early music breathe fire; she is a great singing actress in the Callas tradition.  And amazingly, she is the first among equals--every member of the cast makes a  stellar contribution to the musico-dramatic effect.  I found myself looking up four or five names.  The production mercifully avoids updating, tricks, and general directorial misconduct.  It looks quite handsome except for a bit of ugly and unnecessary scaffolding.  All hail to William Christie--what he has done to enhance our knowledge and appreciation of the baroque (originally the French repertoire, here the Italian) is extraoerdinary, invigorating, moving.  My highest recommendation.",1423180800,,786,5.43801652892562
8526847,5,B008CWR4ZM,"Piece of old opera on the motives of Troy war by Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676) is yet another great piece from the ansamble under the best-performing conductor William Christie. If you love the baroque opera, make your time also for this opus, even if it is from somewhat older era. I have found this opera the other way - I just buy productions by Mr. Christie and I am confident it will be great. It is, also with La Didione.",1368921600,,427,4.417721518987341

Who could have predicted that the Wheel of Fortune would turn so far and that Francesco Cavalli (1602-1676) would suddenly become the 'hottest new thing"" in the world of opera???

And here now, a second production of La Didone, musically far superior to the previous effort. Hallelujah!

Cavalli has generally been regarded as a disciple of Monteverdi, and some musicologists have suggested that he worked closely with Monteverdi on the completion of L'Incoronazione di Poppea. But one doesn't need a course in music history to hear the continuation of Monteverdi's art in Cavalli's music. La Didone is the most Monteverdi-esque of the Cavalli operas resuscitated so far. It's a twin to Poppea in both musical and dramatic language. Like Poppea, the bulk of the libretto is sung in recitativo over basso continuo, plus boisterous, often sardonic ritornelli sung usually by ensembles of minor characters. The most ambiguous character -- Dido's would-be lover King Iarbas -- is both fool and philosopher, combining the Monteverdi characters of Ottone and Seneca. The famous love duet that concludes L'Incoronazione, between Nerone and Poppea, has a parallel in La Didone. The ""Gods"" are just as meddlesome and captious in Cavalli's comi-tragedy as in Monteverdi's tragi-comedy. Don't get the impression, however, that La Didone is merely a knock-off of Poppea! It's a work of almost equal brilliance; when we get to know it as well as we know the three surviving operas of Monteverdi, we may decide to erase the word ""almost"" from that judgment.

La Didone is darker in mood than Poppea, less aloof from folly and therefore less disposed to mockery. The libretti of both operas were written by Giovanni Busenello, and both are taut, subtle expression of 17th Century skepticism. La Didone has the better flourishes of Italian poetic language, the vibrancy of which survives translation into English in the subtitles. 17th C opera sought the ideal fusion of words and music -- eloquent words, to which the music was intentionally subordinated. The story of Dido and Aeneas would be set in operatic form again and again, with Berlioz's Les Troyens as the grandest setting, but no post-1700 libretto has had the poetic charms of Busenello's.

For us of the 21st C, of course, it's the music that matters far more than the poetry or the drama. Let's be frank about this staging: not a cent was lavished on costumes that could have been spent for the hiring of voices. The result is a cast of fourteen superb singers, each of whom gets moments of exquisite display, all primped up in bathrobes. Don't fret! The acting aplomb of most of them, supported by crafty camera-work, is enough to compensate for the stodgy sets and costumes. And even the weakest actors -- Terry Wey, for instance, in the role of Ascanio -- more than justify themselves vocally.

La Didone is not an orchestral opera, even by 17th C norms. The instrumentalists in the pit have merely the briefest flurries of notes not subordinated to the singing. Nonetheless, the sixteen members of Les Arts Florissants deserve equal credit for the glory of this music. The ensemble includes recorder, 2 violins, 2 violas, cello, gamba, lyrone, double-bass, dulcian, harp, theorbo, lute, guitar, and 2 harpsichords. That's a rich continuo, amici miei! Conductor William Christie is the genius who holds it all together.
Viva Bill Christie! Viva!",1352851200,6,4479,6.037735849056604
8526850,5,B008CWR4ZM,"Depending on the work, depending on who is playing it and depending on how it is staged, Cavalli's operas - some of the oldest works in existence - can struggle to hold the attention of a modern audience.  There are no such difficulties with this particular work - one of Cavalli's earliest operas first performed in 1641 - a version of the familiar story of the Fall of Troy and the love story of Dido and Aeneas, and with the production being in the hands of William Christie and his company, Les Arts Florissants, there are no concerns either about the musical interpretation of La Didone, which is staged with dramatic intensity by Clment Herve-Lger and sung exceptionally well by a youthful cast.

What makes La Didone rather more accessible than some works of early opera is the fine libretto by Giovanni Francesco Busenello, the librettist responsible for Monteverdi's groundbreaking L'Incoronazione di Poppea, an opera that daringly put real characters onto the stage for the first time rather than the gods and heroes of ancient mythology.  Even though La Didone is related to the mythological figures of Virgil's epic Latin poem The Aeneid, it benefits nonetheless from Busenello's wonderful humanising of the characters and indeed the gods.  The libretto isn't made up of the usual vague pronouncements and declarations, but is dramatically and poetically expressive of the range of human emotions and passions that are brought out by this expansive work.  In the first half the libretto captures the true horror and nature of the experience of war, where numerous figures and even ghosts wander around the dark ruins of Troy in despair, terrorised by marauding Greeks.  Much like division in Berlioz's Les Troyens, the second larger part of La Didone deals with Aeneas' arrival in Carthage and with the trials that are brought by love and betrayal, expressed in a variety of ways, through Dido's love for her dead husband, her rejection of Iarbas, and in her love for Aeneas' that is curtailed by his sense of duty (to the gods) to abandon her and strike out for Italy.

This wonderfully rich story is brilliantly described in Busenello's libretto, but if it truly achieves the same kind of expression of human passions that can be found in L'Incoronazione di Poppea, it's also due to the musical compositions of Cavalli, himself a pupil of Monteverdi.  William Christie directs this from the harpsichord and the rhythms and tone are clear, precise and dynamically attuned to the emotional content of the work, emphasising the horror with driving chords and accompanying the delicate laments and love-songs with heartfelt lyricism.  Clment Herve-Lger keeps the sets simple, working in perfect accordance with the music and the drama of the libretto, employing only one or two large and effective symbolic gestures.  It's not period, but other than the inappropriate scaffolding for the down-to-earth gods and Venus lugging a suitcase for her journey to Carthage - an effort to humanise the appearances of the gods in line with the nature of the work and against the tradition of big fanfares and mechanical stage entrances - there are no distracting modern anachronisms.

With the simplicity of the staging and the sparseness of the orchestration compared to conventional opera - harpsichord and lyrone basso continuo with a limited range of period string instruments - much depends on the quality of the singing here.  Populated extensively from Christie's 'Jardin des Voix' school for new young talent, the singing is exceptional right across the whole cast.  Anna Bonitatibus is a clear, powerful and resonant Didone (Dido), and Kresimir Spicer a gentle lyrical Enea (Aeneas), both of them commanding and deeply expressive in the central roles, but the cast - clearly trained for this kind of singing - is made up of youthful voices filled with passion, clarity and a purity of tone that is well suited to early opera (some however - such as Francisco Javier Borda playing both Ilioneo and Mercury - try a little too hard).  La Didone is still not without some longeurs for anyone unfamiliar with early opera, but this is certainly one of the more accessible works of this period, treated to a beautiful looking and fresh sounding production from Les Arts Florissants, that brings a much needed vitality to this rare 370 year-old work.

Opus Arte's Blu-ray release comes with impressive specifications in terms of High Definition image and sound.  The period instruments in particular have a wonderful clarity of tone within the natural reverb of the Caen theatre.  It sounds a little bright and there's no low-frequency range at all in the DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mix, but it's distributed well emphasising the fragility of the delicate playing and the strength of the vocal expression.  The PCM Stereo mix is also clear and true.  The BD is dual-layer BD50, 1080i and all-region compatible, with subtitles in English, French and German only.  There are no extra features other than a Cast Gallery and a booklet with an essay on the work which has a brief outline of the story, but there is no detailed synopsis.",1346544000,21,5128,5.010588235294118
