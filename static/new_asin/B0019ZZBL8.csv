8355010,5,B0019ZZBL8,"This DVD features tips from many of the best baristas around in a fun and educational short film. While this certainly covers the basics, I think it would be better received by people with some experience as a barista but not indoctrinated to the point of not being responsive to hearing some of the very basics as told by highly experienced professionals. There were a couple moments in there that I thought to myself ""Yeah, yeah, we know,"" but it was after being a production barista for about four years. Other parts of the video more than made up for it and the cross section showing the different approaches was really great to have. I think this does a great job of pointing out that while there is a fairly small window for acceptable product, there is no one-right-way to go about producing it (though consistency is king).

I'd highly recommend this to anyone wanting to step up their game as a production barista, refine or refresh the views of a professional barista, or simply as a philosophical debate of styles for a barista considering training for competition.

I don't imagine folks with little interest in espresso getting much out of this movie even if they work in the coffee industry - its target audience is beginning professionals who actually want to know about coffee - though home coffee enthusiasts may find it interesting. Trainers should not lean on this as an educational video. It ought to be an optional refresher and filler for baristas who have already had preliminary training. If used as the first step in learning, I can imagine this somewhat alienating some of the newbies who could otherwise become excellent baristas if given proper training first. This is more than a training video, though, and can be quite entertaining at parts.

As a warning, do not put much stock in the title. This video alone does not prepare a barista for a championship/competition really at all. Instead, it used those who are at the level to compete to showcase some of the techniques necessary to approach their level. This video also does not address coffee sourcing, roasting, profiling for espresso, or latte art - all of which are skills baristas should seek to delve into around the level this video is intended to bring you towards.",1268352000,,2258,4.7846153846153845
