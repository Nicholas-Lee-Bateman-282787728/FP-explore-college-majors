3167358,4,B00175UBWO,"""Turn Your Radio On with Bill and Gloria Gaither and their Homecoming Friends"" was originally produced in 1993. One of the earliest in the Homecoming phenomenon was produced at the Gaither Pinebrook studio in Anderson, Indiana. Gaither describes the event as ""all day singing and dinner on the grounds.""

Albert Brumley's song ""Turn Your Radio On"" is the theme for this concert and features Gaither's favorites from early radio singers, including: George Younce, the Speers, Rex Nelon, Hovie and Mosie Lister, Eva Mae LeFevere, Jim Hill, Glen Payne, James Blackwood, The Goodman's, Doris Akers, Jake Hess, and others.

Some of the songs I especially enjoyed are: The Unclouded Day, Looking for a City, and I Will Meet You in the Morning, and Vestal Goodman singing Til the Storm Passes By. I also enjoyed the Imperials and was impressed with the songs sung by younger artists Russ Taft and Cynthia Clauson who have been influenced by the earlier performers. I was touched by the interview with James Blackwood as he shared stories of the long career of the Blackwood Brothers.

The Homecoming Friends obviously hold each other in high esteem, are dedicated performers eager to honor Jesus with their music, and are united in their desire to share the Gospel message with their audience.",1302912000,3,1286,5.028169014084507
3167359,5,B00175UBWO,"Bill Gaither's passion for the radio stations is the theme.  And, those he listened to, have become his friends.  This is a studio performance, filmed in Alexandria, Indiana 2004.

When gospel writer Albert Brumley's music was always being heard on the radio, someone would always call him and say, 'Albert, turn your radio on'""  That phrase inspired the song, ""Turn Your Radio On.""

So many Homecoming Friends from the radio days are here, George Younce, The Speer Family, Rex Nelon, Hovie Lister, Mosie Lister, Eva Mae LeFevre,  Jim Hill, Glen Payne, Jake Hess, The Goodmans, writer Doris Akers, James Blackwood, etc.

You will see some of the young ones influenced by the older generation, Russ Taff sings emotionally to ""Father Along"".  And what a beautiful song, from one of the most beautiful voices, Cynthia Clawson,  ""Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus"".

Vestal Goodman joins pianist Wally Varner, for ""Looking For a City"", where she and Johnny Cook continue their challenge of highest voices.  I think Cook wins.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Happy-Goodman-Family-Live-in-Texas/dp/B000SQL4Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Happy Goodman Family: Live in Texas</a>. Vestal sings ""This is Just What Heaven Means to Me"" and ""Til the Storm Passes By"".

Two favorite songs, one written by Jim Hill, who sings ""What A Day That Will Be"" and another beautiful classic ""The Eastern Gate"", this time sung by Lily Fern Weatherford who had recently lost her husband, Earl.  Ann Downing's husband Paul had also died recently.  Myron LeFevre joins his Eva Mae for ""Mansion Over the Hilltop"".

You will hear travel stories, testimonies, and James Blackwood shares about that day when the plane crashed in 1954 and that killed members of the Blackwood Brothers who began in 1934.  The Fairfield Four dropped by for ""Dig A Little Deeper"".  Someone we don't see too often, Squire Parsons, but does sing a wonderful song, ""Sweet Beulah Land""; ""The Unclouded Day""  features Howard Goodman.

Not sure where this scene comes from, but Vestal does a duet with JOhnny Cook.  They sang previously and it was always fun to see who sang higher.

George Younce and Larry Ford sing ""I Know Who Holds Tomorrow"" and the Friends sing with Doris Akers, her ""Sweet, Sweet Spirit"".

The highlight for me was another beautiful song by Cynthia Clawson, played at the end, just showing clips of the folks laughing, singing, and tender moments was ""If We Never Meet Again"" written by Albert Brumley. Cynthia does the song much justice.

This is a wonderful gathering of the radio folks, the old Friends, those newer ones who they influenced.  Many of these folk have gone home, but thanks to the Gaither DVDs, we meet them again.
