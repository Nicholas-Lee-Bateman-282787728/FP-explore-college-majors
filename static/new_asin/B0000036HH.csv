I own a lot of Mafia documentaries and I really like this one.  If you are a fan of these documentaries, I would buy this.  The music and the narrator are great in my opinion.  Al Capone and Johnny Torrio would be proud!  I wish someone would make this on DVD and spice it up a bit!",1292198400,,425,4.2625
