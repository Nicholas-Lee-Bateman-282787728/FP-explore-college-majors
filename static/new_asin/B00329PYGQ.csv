4055028,5,B00329PYGQ,"Recently, I viewed this film in a Portland, Oregon theatre, with Dr. Ellsberg in person conducting a Q&A session following the film.

Reviewed from any direction, this is an excellent piece of personal reportage.  Meticulously researched, truthfully written, realisticly but creatively shot, and marvelously edited, this is a serious and highly responsible documentation, not only of an important period of American history, but also of the broad and deep failure of this generation of leaders in positions of responsibility to ""do the right thing.""  And, it may well be a predictor of what can happen to the future of presidential leadership, if well-informed, highly responsible  and conscientious citizens and the mainstream media don't take our roles seriously, and act to preserve the values on which this country was founded.

4055029,5,B00329PYGQ,I sat riveted to my seat while watching this engrossing documentary.  Everyone should see this.  I commend Daniel Ellsberg for his integrity and courage.  I can't wait to own the DVD.,1268697600,3,183,4.838709677419355
4055030,5,B00329PYGQ,"No government really likes a whistle-blower, especially when that person blows the faade off a seemingly until then justified war. There is something in the ethos of Western civilization that, whether the exposure is done for good and without expectations of remuneration or evil, would rather not know the messy details of what goes on in the backrooms and is as likely to `shoot the messenger' as those who created the vast illegality. The word ""snitch"" comes to mind. However  here in this documentary based on the life and times of one Daniel Ellsberg and his brave, no heroic, efforts to get the truth out is well done, well thought out, and worthy of commemoration.

For a younger  generation not familiar with the virtual civil war that was going on in American society in the latter stages of the Vietnam War this will serve as a primer, of sorts. Virtually every institution from the local PTA to the White House was subject to analysis and to questioning about the purposes of its existence. Although such intense scrutiny only lasted for a short while it provided enough political space for the previously seemingly non-heroic ex-Marine Daniel Ellsberg to do his expose, for the mainstream mass media, like the ""New York Times"", ""Washington Post"", and ""The Boston Globe"" very connected to the governmental levers of power, to take a chance on publishing the whole of Ellsberg's discoveries. And, frankly, with the partial exception of Watergate there have been very few subsequent efforts like this from inside the establishment.

Needless to say, most of this documentary is driven by the highlights in the case from initial attempts of Ellsberg to get the expose published to the courts and, ultimately,  the decision to dismiss the criminal charges against him brought by a rabid and vindictive Nixon administration. This film has none of the fawning over of its main figure that ""Fog Of War"" has, the so-called documentary of the late, if unlamented, former Defense Secretary, Robert Strange McNamara, who as fate would have it originally commissioned ""The Pentagon Papers"" giving his take on his handiwork. This production is like a breathe of fresh air in comparison. Whatever you may think of whistle-blowers in other contexts, here hats off to Daniel Ellsberg. Thanks, brother.",1265587200,33,2296,5.047493403693931

4055037,5,B00329PYGQ,"With several whistleblowers in the news lately, all of whom face immediate criminal charges & outraged excoriation by politicians & pundits across the board, it's good to be reminded of history. What these young whistleblowers are doing today is precisely what Daniel Ellsberg did some 40 years ago. Both then & now, the whistleblowers were fairly conservative individuals at first, eager to be of service to their country ... until they gradually became aware of the crimes being committed by their country, from shredding the Constitution to killing innocent civilians around the world.

As this thorough documentary shows, Daniel Ellsberg was condemned by those in power, his character attacked, his sanity questioned, his patriotism denied -- but interestingly enough, time & history have not only vindicated him, but they reveal both his heroism & the criminality of those who attacked him in the name of freedom & liberty & America.

And what terrible crime did Daniel Ellsberg commit? The worst one imaginable, from the viewpoint of those in power: he revealed the truth about Vietnam. He laid bare the endless lies of the government & the military, he showed us that the noble excuses made for such crimes were empty words, and he challenged us to defend our right as citizens to know what was being done in our names without our knowledge. He was willing to face prison, perhaps even death, in order to do the right thing.

I was a teenager when the Pentagon Papers story broke, and I followed it raptly over the weeks & months. I recall very well the efforts to smear & discredit the man, in order to make his character the story rather than face the ugly truth he had shared with the country. And to this day I'm grateful that we had such a man there at the right time, someone with the courage & decency to stand up & speak.

The documentary tells his story clearly, so that even those born decades after the fact will understand what was at stake, and the vital importance of what he did. And perhaps it'll help people today realize that our current whistleblowers are simply following in Ellsberg's footsteps, letting us know what's going on behind the scenes, and enabling us to see through the lies of power.

Most highly recommended!

Note: a fine companion film is the docudrama ""The Pentagon Papers"" with James Spader as Daniel Ellsberg, also highly recommended.",1370995200,9,2381,4.837837837837838

4055041,5,B00329PYGQ,"If you are young enough that you don't know who Daniel Ellsberg is, you definitely need to see this documentary.  Even if you are familiar with this bit of history, you likely don't know the full story told in this riveting film of Ellsberg's transformation from Viet Nam War analyst and planner (in the Pentagon and at the Rand Corporation) to antiwar activist.  An ex-Marine, Ellsberg was a dutiful hawk until he worked on a study of the Viet Nam War for Robert McNamara (Secretary of Defense), saw the reality of the situation, and observed that (by their own admission) the U.S. leaders were continuing what was clearly an unwinnable war only to save face.

As he saw his bosses lying to the public and saw the death and destruction in Viet Nam (where he was assigned for the study), he could no longer justify his suppression of information that made him complicit in the lies.  He decided to ignore the Espionage Act and made copies of  McNamara's 7,000-page study.  He gave copies to antiwar senators, but they were unwilling to risk revealing it. He gave copies to the New York Times.  President Nixon got an injunction on the newspaper. (The title of this film came from Nixon's Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who at this juncture called Ellsberg the most dangerous man in America.)  Ellsberg then got the papers to the Washington Post.  As soon as one newspaper was enjoined, another would start publishing until 17 newspapers got into the action.  Most decisively he smuggled a copy to the young (at the time) Senator Mike Gravel from Alaska, who read it into the Congressional Record, making it forever an open public document.

Having accomplished this, Ellsberg turned himself in to face criminal charges.  By the time he went to court in January, 1973, the war was officially ending and Nixon's henchmen had burglarized the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist (to try to discredit him) as well as the office of the Democratic National Party in the Watergate Hotel.  These facts were brought into Ellsberg's trial, which was taking place during the Watergate hearings.  When evidence of White House wiretaps of Ellsberg was introduced, the judge was forced to dismiss all charges.  Ellsberg had expected to spend the rest of his life in prison and very well might have, had things worked out differently.  As it was, he was attacked, despised, and disowned by many, including many of his closest associates at Rand and in the government.  Ellsberg said recently that human beings are herd animals and will go along with most anything to remain a part of the group.  And a big part of going along is often saying nothing about what you see, even if you are clear that it is not right.

So you might say that Daniel Ellsberg indirectly managed to stop the Viet Nam War and remove Richard Nixon from office, although it was Nixon's attempts to destroy Ellsberg that led to his own destruction.

Narrated by Ellsberg, this film reveals who inspired his action. One inspiration was Thoreau, who wrote in his essay on civil disobedience,  ""Cast your whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence.""  He describes his powerful emotional response to a war activist, who went to prison for his protest, as a turning point.  He reveals who assisted him:  his antiwar activist wife; his Rand associate Anthony Russo (who suggested and assisted him in copying the papers and was charged in court along with him); and  his young children  (who helped him make copies).

It is discouraging how lukewarm the public was toward the release of the Pentagon papers.  Perhaps we have long accepted it as normal and all right for public officials to lie.  Also discouraging is how the same patterns are repeated.  Ellsberg, still an activist for peace and for transparency of government (for which he has been arrested fairly regularly), notes in recent interviews that the Pentagon papers were a wakeup call in the 70s but the 9/11 events have wiped that out.  He sees worrying parallels to the Viet Nam War in our relationship to Afghanistan today.

I didn't expect to write such a long review when I began this.  The film provokes much thought about vocation, about standing for what is right, and standing alone when you have only your conscience to guide you.  These subjects need to be high on the list of ""those who have ears to hear.""",1348531200,6,4358,4.789825970548862

When I saw the film Mr. Ellsberg spoke afterward about what we had seen, what many of us remembered about the time, and what was still missing from the story just presented to us. Good as the movie is - and it deserves to be seen widely as an example of how individual choices and individual courage can inspire change - the movie that could have been is even greater.",1322092800,4,620,4.495575221238938
4055043,5,B00329PYGQ,I bought two different movies having to do with the Pentagon Papers.  The Most Dangerous Man in America is the best one. There is allot of political passion and deep conscience of the man who revealed what is the truth.  This movie shows secrets and cover-ups in Congress and all the way up to the CIA and all other Intelligence.  To include all of the lies that America was fed just to keep up a war in Vietnam that should have never been.  I was never against this war but this movie caused me to reconsider my old opinions.  I was just a child when this war was started.  I am glad that I purchased this DVD.,1313452800,9,611,4.17948717948718

4055045,5,B00329PYGQ,"What kind of transformation would move someone who was a dedicated Marine, and scholar, and who worked for the American Military Industrial Complex and turn them into a leaker of classified information to the American public and the world - making them in the words of Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State under Richard Nixon the ""Most Dangerous Man In America?""

Daniel Ellsberg's story is told here, filling out a lot of unknown history the United States during the Viet Nam era, but informative to the whole Post-WWII mindset of the United States as an empire and one of the most militarily active hegemonies that has ever existed, particularly given our branding and self-image.

This is an amazing documentary, should be required viewing for all Americans as to what business as usual means in the United States of America.  At least watch this movie, if not buy it!",1295222400,6,870,4.904761904761905
4055046,5,B00329PYGQ,While the events in this film took place in the 1970's they are equally relevant today with unnecessary wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan and current Wikileaks disclosures.  This is a must view film for anyone who fears the damage that can be caused by unchecked governmental power.  We sorely need another Daniel Ellsberg today.,1294012800,3,329,4.963636363636364
4055047,5,B00329PYGQ,"I was transfixed by this moving account of Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers. If you lived through this era, all of those names flashed repeatedly in the nightly news at the time will come alive to you. If you were born post Pentagon Papers, you can find out about an absolutely pivotal time in the history of the United States. I took away SO much from this movie. It is a fascinating, riveting portrayal of the events and issues of that time.

But, more importantly, it shows how this man, Daniel Ellsberg, evolved. Mr. Ellsberg reveals, in a very personal, raw narrative of how he came to make this profound, dramatic turn. The culture of denial, cover-up and delusion became undeniably apparent. He stated, ""it wasn't that we were on the wrong side, we were the wrong side."" He teaches us, through his experience, without being preachy, not only to question authority, but to question ourselves. To face reality, and act responsibly, even if this means facing disdain and contempt, losing your career, and indeed, your very freedom.

The documentary also elucidates the role of Randy Kehler, a war resister, in his dramatic influence on Daniel Ellsberg. We had never heard much about him. One person really can make a difference. Even if he or she is not famous, or in ""high places"".

I am tempted to say this movie ripped my heart out. And it did. But it also reached in, very deep, and grabbed my conscience.
The messages in this documentary will stay with me forever. This man's bravery and courage continues today as he speaks out when it is not popular. I feel like I know him now. Thank you Daniel Ellsberg. And thank you to your late, bold, daring ""partner in crime"", Anthony Russo. I can still hear your whistles blowing.",1293926400,7,1739,4.676470588235294
4055048,5,B00329PYGQ,"I watched this film tonite and was absolutely riveted at all times. The documentary does not have a slow moment, and can only give the viewer hope that BIG government will not take over; that one man CAN make a difference. Narrated by Ellsberg himself, it's as straight-forward as could be; fine insight from smart contemporaries. I can't recommend this film more highly.  I was a student at UW~Madison during the '70 protests/riots.  It's good to know the protests weren't (entirely) in vain. Show this to your kids, if you dare, though Nixon's foul language may not be acceptable. DVD extras can only bring light to Ellsberg's ostracizing, and Nixon's paranoia. Domestically, Nixon was OK; he just didn't know how to deal with the world at large. Nothing was said about Ford ending the war and pardoning Nixon, which I thought was a smart move; let's be glad it was all OVER! No more baggage to burden the taxpayers.

Watching this documentary provides not only a window into past American foreign policies, but also a solid body of knowledge to understand how US government operates. Thirty five years after the end of the Vietnam war, we see the nation in not one, but two other unjustified and un-winnable wars, and the same stubbornness to ""stay the course,""at the immeasurable price of human life and resources. Once again, three and a half decades later, the whistle blows on war crimes and, as with The Pentagon Papers, the government goes after the whistle blowers; the crimes continue.

What most astonished me in this documentary was not the story of how the Vietnam war was rejected in the '70s, but the fact that nowadays nobody seems to care on the current wars being fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Nixon administration classified a man like Ellsberg ""the most dangerous man of America""; nowadays, we still have ""dangerous men and women"", but nobody cares; Richard Gage has united more than 1.000 architects and engineers, people who professionally know that the three skyscrapers that went down on 9/11 couldn't possibly have done so due to fire, but were controlled demolitions (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-Mysteries-Part-1-Demolitions/dp/B000QGE8A6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11 Mysteries Part 1: Demolitions</a>) - they all insist in a new investigation; we have a man like David Ray Griffin, who has summed up more than 50 arguments why the official version of 9/11 is a big lie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-New-Pearl-Harbor-Revisited-9-11-the-Cover-Up-and-the-Expos/dp/1566567297/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the Cover-Up, and the Expos</a>); we even have a former Pentagon officer, April Gallop, prosecuting her own former boss, for the bombing of the Pentagon, where her son was seriously hurt; but : who cares?

Nobody cares, because the press is no longer independent.  Forty years ago, the New York Times and The Washington Post still had some editorial independence and somehow fulfilled their role as government watchdogs; nowadays, those papers are fully corporate-controlled; CIA director William Casey claimed in 1981 that ""We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.""

Nobody cares, because even if there would be a desire to do so, there is hardly any free time left... precisely because we are submerged, once again, in a Great Depression, courtesy of our real ""masters"" - the big banks...  Obama recently said : ""We have spent over a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas. This, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits. For too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform. As a result, too many middle class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation's long-term competitiveness is put at risk.""

On top of that, we don't have popular leaders any more firmly opposing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  John Lennon sang ""Give peace a chance"" and wrote ""Power to the people"" to give the demonstrators a new hymn in the '70s.  He has not only been shot, but no pop star has even come close to his heels to replace this real working class hero.  We are left with Bono, who likes to be invited by Bush and Blair.  He even claims that John Lennon did much harm writing ""Imagine"", a ""very deceiving"" song following him.  Yeah, right, Bono.  The only deception I see in this is you befriending mass murderers, instead of standing up to their unjustified wars.

America 's new legally criminal social structure based on administrative detention, enshrined in The Patriot Act and a number of executive orders, some secret, changed society profoundly, more and more in the direction of a totalitarian state, very far away from the democratic republic the Founding Fathers had in mind.  Heavily-armed SWAT teams smashed down doors and agents armed with search warrants carried out simultaneous raids in Minneapolis and Chicago early morning on the 24th of September 2010.  Rummaging through personal belongings, agents carted off boxes of files, documents, books, letters, photographs, computers and cell phones from Minneapolis antiwar activists Mick Kelly, Jessica Sundin, Meredith Aby, two others, as well as the office of that city's Anti-War Committee.  Meanwhile, FBI agents raided the Chicago homes of activists Stephanie Weiner and Joseph Iosbaker.

4055058,4,B00329PYGQ,"""The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers"" does not offer a detailed account of the contents of the confidential Vietnam study that Ellsberg leaked, but of Daniel Ellsberg's transformation from planner and analyst of the US involvement in Vietnam to anti-war activist, and of the effects that the leak had on Ellsberg, the press, and the Nixon administration. Ellsberg worked for Robert McNamara at the Pentagon in the mid-1960s and then at The Rand Corporation as an analyst, positions which made him privy to information about the Vietnam War that was not known to the public, including a 7,000-page study commissioned by McNamara. After visiting Vietnam himself and digesting all that came across his desk, Ellsberg came to the conclusion that his role in suppressing the information had been dereliction of duty.

In 1969, he resolved to no longer suppress information about the war but to leak the Vietnam study, first to Congress, then, when that didn't produce action, to the press. Ellsberg, himself, takes us through his years of work for the Defense Department and the moral crisis that motivated him, along with Anthony Russo, to run afoul of the Espionage Act. The focus is more on the suppression of the information and the deception of presidents Johnson and Nixon than on the information itself. Ellsberg speaks about his own experiences; family, associates, and co-workers from Rand speak about Ellsberg, to provide a more rounded picture of the man. Once the files are leaked, the film shifts to an account of how they were received by the press and in government, including interviews with New York Times journalists who were on the team that published the first batch of papers.

Ellsberg had (and has) an unusually strong sense of responsibility. He believed that he was responsible for the consequences of his actions at the Defense Department, and so it was his duty to take responsibility and try to limit the harm his actions had done. Of course, he was only one person responsible among many for concealing the reasons and scope of the Vietnam War. In truth, the public did not care as much about the secrets and lies as Ellsberg probably hoped. Perhaps they already suspected. But the leak had the indirect effect of removing Nixon from office and setting important Supreme Court precedent. Filmmakers Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith have made a strong and clear documentary on how a person gets to that point where he no longer feels he can participate in something wrong and is willing to turn against his peers.

The DVD (First Run Features 2010): ""Woody Harrelson Interview"" (4 min) features the actor talking about why he admires Ellsberg and the film. ""Naomi Wolf Interview"" (4 min) interviews the author and academic on how Ellsberg's actions disrupted the lies perpetuated by bureaucracy, as well as his story as great drama. ""The Nixon Tapes"" are 5 audio clips from the Oval Office Nixon tapes on subjects relevant to the Pentagon Papers leak. This includes a conversation in which FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover schmoozes the insecure president, who seems well aware of what Hoover is doing but appreciates it anyway. There are also filmmaker biographies (text). No subtitles are available for the film.",1280448000,5,3273,5.012867647058823

This new film - while honing in on the 1970s Pentagon Papers - really exposes how government tried to squelch the freedom of the press. As such - and because a whole generation of adults are too young to remember when this occurred (or were not born yet) - this film needs to be seen by every American. Whether you consider Ellsberg a hero or traitor the film will show you what he uncovered and how the Supreme Court resolved it. The film WILL hold your attention.

By making it available on home DVD so soon after it received the Oscar nomination, First Run Features is making sure it gets out there. Every school and library should be stocking this.

The DVD has some bonus features both essential and superfluous. The 4-minute ""Interview"" with actor Woody Harrelson (never sure why he was chosen) is really a trailer for the film with Harrelson's urging viewers to see it blended with scenes from the film. Author Naomi Wolf spends four minutes basically doing the same. Then comes the real prize: A selection of audio clips from the Nixon Tapes, which were only excerpted in the film. These are riveting and the clarity is astounding. They add so much to understanding the mind-think of Nixon and his advisors that I recommend this part even to those who saw the film in the theater.

A well-deserved Oscar nom. Get the DVD.

4055060,1,B00329PYGQ,"He took a security clearance and committed espionage in the release of information, based on his political opinion.

He lied when he said he would honor the protection of classified documents, he handed the enemy a bonanza of information and propaganda points.  He worked hand in hand with a leftist press (not that it's changed, but in fact is even more obvious) to change foreign policy.

He's not a Whistle-Blower, but essentially a traitor.

You now have the intelligence agencies now filled with this type of narcisitic scum.  Disagree with what the elected administration is doing?  Well just cherry pick and release classified information to try and derail it.

These people wrap themselves in the mantle of being oh so special, but simply show how huge an ego they have, that they alone should release the nation's secrets.

You may not agree with policy, but it's not your policy to make.  That's what elections are for.  And if you think a nation shouldn't have secrets, you are simply some naive dreamer that doesn't understand the real world.",1279756800,10,1054,4.903954802259887
