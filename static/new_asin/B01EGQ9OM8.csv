This has a fairly complex story that uses the motives of love and greed as motives for crimes. The idea of a banker taking bank funds for his personal use must have occurred enough times to make this story believable.

Before this a bank robbery would create a local economic hardship due to a loss of cash needed for commerce.",1510012800,,2586,4.4724576271186445
