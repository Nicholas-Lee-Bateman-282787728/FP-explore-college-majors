711716,4,6303686737,"Businessman Jake Van Doren's(George C. Scott in a riveting, brilliant performance) life and his deeply held religious beliefs are shaken to their core. Van Doren's teenage daughter doesn't return from a church outing. Worried, Van Doran hires a private detective Andy Mast(Peter Boyle)to help track her down. What Mast returns with shakes Van Doren Calvinist faith. His daughter has been appearing in cheap porno movies. Van Doren realizes the only way to bring his daughter back from this seamy, sordid world is if he goes to get her himself. He poses as a porno producer to get leads that will take him to his daughter in hopes that he can get her back before something truly horrible happens to her.

This riveting drama from Paul Schrader (""Taxi Driver"")clearly draws from some of Schrader's own convictions and religious beliefs. His upbringing as a Calvinist influences and informs the character of Van Doren. Scott, Boyle ""Outland"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), Dick Sargant (""Bewitched""), Season Hubley and Marc Alaimo (""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"")The DVD transfer looks crisp and sharp. Unfortunately, the age of the film and the film stock means that it does look grainy but that actually works in favor of the story capturing the harsh look of porno movies and giving a gritty reality to the film.

There's no extras on the film which is a pity. I would love to have heard Schrader's comments on the making of the film 25 years later. While George C. Scott isn't around any longer, Season Hubley and Peter Boyle could also have provided a commentary track (and it would have been less expensive to produce than a featurette on the making of the film). It seems to me I recall a vintage promo piece that was aired on TV during its theatrical run. Including that along with some updated interviews with Boyle, Hubley and producer Buzz Feitshans would have provided extra value here but, knowing the limited budget the producer of the DVD had to work with, it was probably cost prohibitive. It's a pity as this terrific but brutal film certainly deserves far better than just a standard transfer without any extras.",1095206400,22,2123,4.894444444444445

Schrader himself is a product of the christian reformed dutch immigrant tradition, with the apex of that life being in Grand Rapids, MI.

711718,4,6303686737,"...  As I had a pre-existing interest in the darker aspect of human sexuality, I was intrigued by the content of this film.  George C. Scott's character gradually descends into a realm of the human experience which he finds disturbing & shocking.  It's a realm where sexual deviancy exists.  It's a realm which is diametrically opposed to his conservative religious beliefs.  One scene which remains imprinted upon my mind involves Scott's character entering a sadomasochistic establishment to track down one of the pornographers who knows the whereabouts of his lost daughter.  During this sequence of scenes, Scott's character is enraged as he rampages through various chambers within the establishment; each chamber contains different bondage paraphernalia and is bathed in a different colored light.  This is an eerie but surreal sequence of scenes.  It's quite effective; it conveys the twisted & warped atmosphere of the dark region of the human experience Scott's character has finally infiltrated in a desperate attempt to locate his missing daughter.
  One of the most frightening aspects of the film is the allusion to snuff pornography. ...",1045612800,4,1151,5.344444444444444

Hal Williams, who was also in ""Private Benjamin"", steals this movie in a startling scene where he is interviewed by Scott, who is masquerading as a porno filmmaker. Williams portrays porno star Dick Black, a.k.a. ""Big Dick Black"", who, when told by the Scott character that he's ""not the type"", proudly tells him of his ""qualifications"".

Because he wants to find his daughter, who has disappeared into the porno  underworld whilst on a field trip, Scott bites his tongue and adapts to a  world that he cannot comprehend.

Scott is as good as I've ever seen him, and Season Hubley makes me wish she'd had this kind of material for more of her  career.  But speaking of material, it's Paul Schrader's script and  directing that make this thing run.  Though the ending is a bit contrived,  there are scenes that seem so *real*; there are others that seem so  *surreal*.  There are others that seem to be both, and those are the ones  that always get me.  Schrader's Calvinist background collides violently  with the latter 20th century, and the results are frequently amazing and  quite thought-provoking.  For its seedy subject matter, this is a radically  religious, moral, and ethical film, and a worthy successor to Schrader's  TAXI DRIVER script.

711885,5,6303686737,"First off, before the review of this movie, which finally received a terrific HD transfer on the Twilight Time Blu Ray, it must be noted that the 2016 Commentary Track by director Paul Schrader is just... heartbreaking. At this point of life, he's very difficult to understand, and while his nightmare stories on dealing with George C. Scott are kind of interesting, all he does is knock the movie, telling all the people who shelled out $30 bucks or more that it's nothing compared to the movies he does today, all of which are either forgotten or unknown. He points out he wasn't a good writer in the 1970's. That even Warren Beatty, in 2000, told him he turned into a good writer. The guy who wrote Taxi Drive and Blue Collar and this masterpiece of subtle brilliance has no clue about the cinema he helped created. He says that 70's movies are hard to sit through because of the time spent on dialogue, and getting to know the story and characters. Guess he prefers the MTV style change after Top Gun. Sad. But anyhow, now... onto the movie...

George C. Scott is a straight-laced, Midwestern business-owner with an innocent daughter who, on a church trip from hometown Grand Rapids, Michigan to Southern California, suddenly goes missing at an amusement park (Knotts Berry Farm, to be exact)...

Desperate, and with only a mellow lecture from the police, he hires a street-smart, quirky L.A. Private Eye, Peter Boyle, who literally proves that his client's runaway daughter is a porn actress, resulting in an awkward (and at this point, YouTube-famous) tantrum from Scott that few actors could get away with... But what's really intriguing, and even humorous without being distracting or contrived, is how Scott's Jake Van Dorn clashes with Boyle's gumshoe, symbolically named Andy Mast, their verbal dynamic exceeding intentional scene-stealer Leonard Gaines as a Los Angeles porn producer more talkative than ""Easy Andy"" from Schrader's original game-changing script of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, TAXI DRIVER...

Back on track: After a few weeks, Jake returns to California and in doing so, wanders the streets, going from porn stores to massage-brothels backed by Jack Nitzsche's bluesy hard-rock score, practically bursting through the screen (eventually curbed by Neil Young's vulnerable acoustic 'Helpless' playing in a sex shop). The juxtaposition of the conservative loner lost in a modern Gomorrah is both mesmerizing and familiar (""Are YOU talkin' to me?!""). Eventually, the film loses some validity when our woebegone lead goes undercover as a would-be-producer, donning a bogus mustache and mirrored shades, weeding out young porn-actors in search of the one guy (Ryan O'Neal's failed getaway driver in THE DRIVER) in the only photo of his daughter, at work. Although this sequence is entertaining, providing a more conventional audience a break from the severe mainline, it somewhat trivializes the edgy and risque subject-at-hand, curtailing the essential danger of the quest, which had a sparse, unapologetic exploitation vibe beforehand.

The most pivotal and engrossing scenes occur during the third act, not involving sex or nudity, but what Schrader does best: one-on-one dialogue when Scott hires multi-talented prostitute, porn actress and window-room dancer Season Hubley to help him since Boyle, spending more time with skanks than finding clues, wasn't closing the deal fast enough for a desperate and determined father: Their conversations, ranging from Faith to Johnny Carson, Damnation to Bestiality, evokes peripheral comparisons of two completely different human beings  the Calvinist and the Whore, both alike in their aloof indifference to society, and sex  injecting a philosophical edge into the forefront, even surpassing Travis Bickle's similar-themed conversation with young hooker Iris (ala Robert DeNiro and Jodie Foster in, again, TAXI DRIVER). But some of the time, much like William Freidkin's CRUISING, we don't get as involved or firmly-planted inside the ""perverse"" underworld as we're led to believe...

The voyeuristic camera seems mounted to the wall during many scenes  often more seductive than revealing. And the finale, involving Scott beating up the villain, is way too typical, more befitting the following decade (when heavies were punched into swimming pools): It's the contrasting... and ultimately connecting... philosophical discussions, providing random breaks throughout an intentionally grueling road, that makes this semi-obscure Paul Schrader vehicle work: a late-70's counter-culture flick (with a few STAR WARS sightings) that needs a much bigger, far more dedicated cult following  hope this helps.",1489276800,4,4673,5.407967032967033

711889,5,6303686737,"Presented as a tragedy, it's almost a comedy. The protagonist ""Jake Van Dorn"", played by George C. Scott, is a staunch right winger from a northern bible belt. He's God fearing but not above violence. Occupied by his small business and ulcers, he doles out free advice even when it's not welcomed. Incidentally, he loves his daughter. Perhaps these are the traits that make her rebellion credible as she succumbs to a fate worse than death.

The detective ""Andy Mast"", is hired to search for Jake's daughter. Actor Peter Boyle, is known for his performance as the campaign manager in ""The Candidate"" as well as many other noteworthy appearances. Admitting to an occasional roll in the gutter himself, Andy challenges Jake's moral high ground.

Here's the twist. In the pursuit of his daughter Jake finds himself the surrogate father of a whore ""Niki"", played by Season Hubley. Unwittingly trying to convert her while she tries to relate to him, they both must fail in the end.

Like many good movies, this one is almost a documentary. We get a glimpse inside the sleazy world of the sex industry. The porno wheel ""Ramada"", played by Leonard Gaines is brilliantly written and must have been fun for the actor to do. Directing and shooting a porn scene is very serious business.

712022,5,6303686737,Excellent morality film about George C Scott's Calvinist faith and the seedy porn industry of 1970s Los Angeles. The polarity is superb as he searches in vain for his missing daughter who had fled her ultra conservative loveless small town home seeking the Californian dream of becoming a somebody but ends up sliding into the dark world of cheap porn. George C Scott hires private eye played by Peter Boyle to help find her because at times he is completely out of his depth in this alternative lifestyle of porn clashing with his strict Calvinist beliefs. He appears cold at times. His wife has left him and his daughter a runaway so we gather all is far from perfect in his little world. We also see a complete personality change as he has some sort of breakdown by what he sees in the porn industry but is his daughter doing it against her will or is she doing it as freedom of choice and breaking away from the strict Calvinist conservatism. Arguments for and against both lifestyles. A true groundbreaking film with thoughtful lness and moral reflection. Peter Boyle not to be overlooked as cynical weary private eye.

The low anthropology (and the high Christology)  of the Dutch Reformed communion is captured perfectly and pornographic California and San Francisco make one understand the insight of Calvin's theology.

712347,2,6303686737,"Hardcore, 1979 film

This is a story about a decaying family. The wife has left her husband, their teenage daughter has run away. The father learns his daughter is in the Los Angeles area. [The pornography capital of America?] The father hires a private investigator, then goes searching for himself. This involves scenes with pornography where parts are blurred out for broadcast quality (but you get the idea). In one scene the father interviews male actors for a porno movie. Are these character parts?

Some of scenes involve subjects that couldn't even be printed in family newspapers decades ago. Now that many newspapers are decaying their standards are lower. This is worth watching for its education about this sleazy exploitation, if you need it. There is little about the family life except what is inferred. Why did a wife abandon her family? Was it her fault? Why did the daughter run away to a destructive life? Drugs aren't mentioned here. Was Daddys behavior suspect?

At the end there is a shooting. Did Justice triumph? But the same emotional and economic forces will generate a replacement to satisfy market demand. Or will there be a slackening of demand due to burnout? There are some comments on the religious beliefs of the father; was this meant as a sick joke? What kind of family life results in a runaway girl? The past life of the father isn't discussed. What did he do for a living? What about their relations and the family settings?

712355,4,6303686737,"""Hardcore"" is just short of a masterpiece solely due to George C. Scott's performance. As a conservative Calvinist from a Dutch Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, MI, Scott must travel up and down California's coast in search of his daughter, who vanishes at a teen church function. However, the film's actual PLOT is quite underdeveloped. The viewer glimpses almost no relationship between Scott and his young daughter before her disappearance; unfortunately, this lends an overall lack of empathy to much of the proceedings. No, the viewer's sympathy lies with SCOTT as a Middle American parent in search of a missing child, and the overall plot, rather than with the young girl herself--we simply know nothing of her, other than her adolescence. Viewers are also led to disgust and revulsion over the seedy pornographic underbelly of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. Scott's brief surrogate fatherhood over a ""fallen woman"" he meets (who gets him much information from the adult film community up and down CA's coast) is thrown by the wayside at the film's denouement, discarding by far the deepest emotional bond in the storyline. More than one character informs Scott: ""You don't belong here."" Indeed, how true this is. I'm not sure the viewer belongs in this picture either, other than catching an opportunity to watch an amazing performance by one of America's greatest actors. Films like this opened the door for the much more violent, but engaging ""8MM."" Naturally, Mr. Van Dorn (Scott) returns to the Midwest in the end, daughter in tow. Her two-minute explication of his emotional distance and maternal absence fail to render any emotional impact so late in the story.

I also liked the fact that this movie was made in an age when there were no fake boobs, and everything you see here is natural. Heck, women were even allowed to have flat chests in those days, and could still be considered beautiful. (Wish it were still that way!)

But I'm getting off track here. The bad part to me - and the reason I don't like the movie - is the character that Scott plays. The man is so crotchety and is such a jerk to everyone that I just could not find myself able or willing to empathize with him. I realize it was part of the character. He would rather beat up people than stoop to asking for help. But I didn't like this.

And he never got any better. He never learned. He went back to Michigan just as closed-minded and insufferable as ever.

Still, gotta love the shirts that George C. Scott wears in this movie! Those 70's shirts rocked. And the pimp-stache he wore for one scene was hilarious, perhaps intentionally so :)

712480,4,6303686737,"I had to laugh at one of the titles of the reviews for this movie ""The Searches Does Porn.""  It is the perfect description of this movie.  For those of you familiar with George C Scott in ""Patton,"" this movie is a great new side to him.  He brings his typically unhinged persona into his father-figure trying to rescue his wayward daughter from her abduction into the late-70s porn world.  But just how willing is she to come back?  You gotta watch.

Schrader is a great writer, but competant director.  He can certainly tell a tale, but while ""Taxi Driver"" is incredible, this is only a journeyman at work as director.  It is a pretty interesting story, but a tad predictable.  But don't let that deter you.  It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged.  But my personal favorite is the vision of porno hell this picture paints of late 70s California.  When looking at it through today's more jaded eyes, it is almost funny how much this world is caricatured in this movie.  It is almost quaint in comparison to the slimy streets of LA portrayed in ""8mm.""  The fashions and mannerisms of the characters in what was a much more innocent in some ways and much more dangerous world in others compared to today are fascinating.

Better than Taken, 8MM, or (dare I even say it?) The Searchers in showing how the obsessive quest to find a lost girl in a seedy milieu corrupts the man trying to find her, Hardcore is perhaps sometimes guilty of exploiting the pornographic material it wallows in, but it's a powerful film that deals in shades of moral ambiguity and is all the better for it; writer-director Paul Schrader--who penned Taxi Driver--brings the audience another dehumanizing urban environment with this film and delivers quite a memorable movie.

712484,5,6303686737,"Paul Schader's ""Hardcore"" (1979) stars George C. Scott as Jake VanDorn, a rigid Calvinist who goes to Southern California to search for his 15 year-old daughter who disappeared during a church youth convention in Disneyland. A hired p.i. (Peter Boyle) finds his daughter on a cheap porn flick, so Jake eventually masquerades as a porn producer to find her. Ultimately a young, lost prostitute, Niki (Season Hubley), assists him and they develop an interesting relationship.

Since ""Hardcore"" deals heavily with the sex industry of the late 70s it's obvious that the film isn't for everyone, but if you can handle it this is a nigh work of genius. Part drama, part thriller, with a bit o' black humor thrown in for good measure, ""Hardcore"" is simply fascinating.

As another reviewer so perfectly notes, ""Hardcore"" explores the dichotomy and similarities of people who live 'hardcore.' Jake's Dutch Calvinist religious faith is so hardcore and rigidly structured that he can explain it in-depth with an acronym (TULIP), whereas the sex industry of S. California is hardcore in a ultra-hedonistic manner. The lifestyles couldn't be more different and yet there are similarities. Niki points out to Jake that they aren't so different -- he feels so little about sex that he doesn't even do it, while she cares so little about sex that she doesn't care who she does it with.

This is a smart film that doesn't spell everything out, but if you watch it closely details emerge. For instance, why did Jake's daughter fly the coop? Why did his wife divorce him? It becomes clear that the VanDorn household was overly rigid and sterile; there was little life, joy, and love, which are intrinsic Christian qualities. The most toxic poison was Jake's hardcore pride, which he weepingly repents of in one potent scene.

But this isn't an anti-Christian film, although it shows the obvious flaws of Jake and his denomination's religiosity, Jake clearly plays the deliverer and the sex industry is portrayed as the ugly, deceitful mire it is. This is one of the few mainstream modern films where the protagonist's Christian faith is overtly depicted. The film doesn't shy away from exploring Jake's faith, and testing it. There's even a prolonged scene where Jake explains the Calvinist credo to Niki. How many Hollywood films allow a character to spend five minutes detailing theological concepts? This alone distinguishes the picture.

Despite Jake's serious pride issues and the sterility of his household, his Calvinism comes off better than the hedonism of late 70's L.A. Jake is on a crusade into the land of heathen and is admirable in that he puts himself in harm's way to find his daughter, and he never succumbs in a land of a thousand temptations. If the Midwesterners are depicted as stern and brittle, at least they are better off than the hedonists of S. California, and the sex industry is a slippery slope that leads to dissatisfaction, addiction and death.

Some complain that it's not believable that Jake's daughter would take such a radical turn toward the sex industry, but let's keep in mind that it's easy for a naive, inexperienced girl to get swept up into something she can't control. Also, don't think that she chose the new life knowing everything up front. It's a slow spiral into hell. The first few steps are exciting and the rest are horrible but tolerable. As you descend, the cumulative effect is balanced by the hardness one gains. You aren't 'hardcore' the moment you step off the bus, so to speak.

The first hour starts to get rather tedious with Jake's intro to the sex industry and ensuing search for his daughter but, take heart, the story picks up in the second half with the introduction of Niki. Her relationship with Jake is the heart of the picture. ***SPOILER ALERT*** We meet this totally lost and humble prostitute and we (and Jake) inexplicably come to like her. She was a runaway of sorts who started turning tricks in Vegas at the young age of 15. Can she be blamed for the hideous hole life has thrust her? (In a way, yes, but that's another subject; let's have some compassion here!). She acts hip but at the same time is desperately seeking a savior. Jake merely hires her to help in his search and unexpectedly finds himself getting close to her, enjoying her company, and vice versa. Jake isn't in any way, shape or form an evangelist but he finds that he can open up and freely discuss his Christian beliefs with Niki, and she's just as free and comfortable to discuss her beliefs (she's a Venusian, whatever that is, lol). ""Hardcore"" is so incredible and original because these characters are ""real"" and they really talk. What's more, although Niki is a pathetic, lost prostitute she has amazing insight into things. For instance, although Jake informs her that his wife died, she ""guesses"" that she actually divorced him and also discerns why she left. Yet, she's not arrogant about her insights; she's obviously highly gifted and yet wasting her life away in the sex industry. ***END SPOILER***

Some complain about the ending but I think it works pretty well; it's happy in one way but downbeat in another. It rings of authenticity (disregarding the contrived Ratan theatrics, that is). ***SPOILER ALERT*** Jake may be a changed man at the end, but not changed enough to handle bringing a former-prostitute back to Michigan as his quasi-adopted daughter. After he successfully finds his daughter he looks at Niki from a distance and she looks at him to discern his intent (will he offer succor or not?) and she KNOWS the truth and turns away, forever. It's a heartbreaking scene, but I guess more realistic than Jake taking her back to Michigan. Regardless, I wish it would have ended with something more hopeful, like Jake doing SOMETHING to help her out of the pit of prostitution. ***END SPOILER***

I was in Las Vegas recently and came across a prostitute like Niki (albeit not as anorexic). She was very young and therefore still beautiful; she looked at me with eyes of feigned desire, likely to pick up some business. In the film these girls are written off as ""a dime a dozen."" I guess no one cares about them.

This is a frightening picture of the pornography business 30 years ago featuring about everything you can think of in that seedy world. Unfortunately, the story centers around finding a girl from a ""religous"" family and the father, played by George C. Scott, is painted as something of a fanatic. He's portrayed as a cold and violent figure. (Hey, Hollywood isn't going to portray a Christian father as kind and loving.) Yet, Scott is not all that bad because he still is extremely dedicated father who went to all lengths to get his daughter back.

This movie really shows the sleazy side of the entire porno business and, thankfully, it doesn't glamorize any of it. Peter Boyle is good as the detective and Season Hubley is interesting as the prostitute who gives you her ideas on life in the business.

This is a fascinating film in parts but also very tough to view in a number of areas. This may sound naive, but when I saw this in 1979, I was stunned that this type of sick-underbelly of a society existed....at least to this degree. I can't imagine what's out there today.

712546,5,6303686737,"In this movie, we see the dichotomy and similarities of people who live ""hardcore.""

First we see the ""hardcore"" world of straightlaced Jake VanDorn (George C. Scott.)  He lives in a world so structured that everything in his life is alphabetized in his hardcore religious faith.  It is such a world that drove away his wife and drove  away his daughter to seek warmth in another world equally as hardcore- the sleazy world of the sex industry.

These two worlds collide in the movie ""Hardcore.""  The worlds are completely alien to each other.  There is no compromise in either of the worlds.  Although the whore Scott befriends and uses (Season Hubley) attempts to draw similarities in these worlds, (Jake feels so little about sex that he dose not even do it and she feels so little about sex that she dose not care who she does it with,) both attiudes are extremely jaded.

You get the feeling of nostalgic timebase in this movie. This was before the videotape and internet sex revolution.  This was the times of the smaller church congregations, before the 10,000 seat megachurches.  This was before the times when men could see on the satellite television what used to be shown in peepshows and 8 mm films.

lots of symbolism was shown in this film.  My favorite example was after the snuff film producer ""Rattan"" was shot.  He stumbles down the sidewalk bleeding to death then smashes his head in a window display of a porn theater. The next window display has a pornographic image, and the writing above it ""love act"".  Could it  portray the death of Rattan as a love act in his twisted world?",1179619200,11,1600,4.660714285714286

The film is stolen, however, by the actor better known for his television work, Hal Williams (who, director Paul Schrader, in the film's commentary, amusingly calls the actor ""Dick Williams"", ironic, since the character Williams plays so memorably is named Dick Blaque.). Williams has said that he regrets this role, which is unfortunate, because he is outstanding as porn star Big Dick Blaque. Williams as Blaque delivers a convincing and powerful performance, boasting about his sexual prowess and the size of his penis. It is a startlingly raw and beautiful scene. The whole movie feels unique and unto itself, signs of a true cult classic. From that wonderfully sexy year of 1979, when disco ruled and sexual freedom abounded.",1174176000,2,1076,5.119318181818182
712548,4,6303686737,"After the obligatory DID WE MENTION HE'S RELIGIOUS??? opening of the film with all the typical Norman Rockwell scenery and lots of organ music (actually not bad...kinda tense and creepy), what you have is a pretty well directed (though badly edited) film with some great performances from George C. Scott and Peter Boyle. Season Hubley does a good job for her (short) part of the film, reminding me of Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Supposedly, the crew of that movie (sans Scorsese) made this one as well, and if so it shows. Replace the (annoying) sax music that pops up constantly in that, replace it with the odd organ music from this and replace the world-weary Travis for an uptight religious guy from the red states and you have the basic idea.

I was expecting it to be at least half as raw as Taxi Driver based on all that, but it's actually closer to a black comedy (okay, except for the snuff film) with Scott delving into the amateur porn industry and getting throw out of a whorehouse. Peter Boyle manages to be sleazy and likeable at the same time, and there's enough 70's style action to keep you interested (since the actual finding of his daughter seems like an afterthought...she's in movie for about ten seconds before she disappears.)

A scathing attack on the recent 'legalization' of pornography when it was made, it ends up being titillating in a disturbing way.  And so over the top, it gets funny, even though the subject is anything but.

An overbearingly religious man loses his daughter and then goes into the underworld that swallowed her, trying to hold onto his own soul as he goes through what he percieves as 'hell on earth' or pretty close to it.  The film's only flaw is that it showed nothing of the reason why his daughter went from a college student to a dead-end porn actress during a 4 hour tour in NYC.  And the Dad was potrayed as being too heroic.  I've met his equivilant in RL, at coffeshops.

712550,3,6303686737,"Hadn't seen this movie in quite a few years. I thought I would check it out when it came out on DVD. This is a story about a Michigan man who is a single parent and lives in a good Christian extended family that he is very close to. His 15 year old daughter inexplicably runs away from home which leads the father to hire a private eye to find her. After several agonizing months the private eye comes to Grand Rapids and takes the father to a dirty movie theater he has rented out and shows him a pornographic film that his daughter is in. The father then goes on a quest to the big city to find his daughter.

George C. Scott is the star of the movie as the anguished father. Peter Boyle also shines as the private investigator. This movie is rated R for obvious reasons. It is a kind of fish out of water movie as this devout Christian father plummets into the depths of the seedy underbelly of the adult entertainment business in the 70's. It is a search that takes him to the most nasty of places, peep shows, massage parlors, S&M places and to the set of porno movies. He also meets and deals with all the people that are a part of this world. Scotts portrayal of the father is fascinating. Seeing him cringe and then become completely undone as he sees his daughters fate on screen is a fathers worst nightmare and he brings that thru to you. He also is like a powder keg as he deals with these scummy people knowing that his daughters life is at risk.

 Boyle is the P.I. who is totally grey through out most of the movie. He is self serving and out for his own interest but he is also an ally to Scott who knows the underbelly of the big city and who and where to look. But he also has his own motives and is hardly a white knight who feels little sympathy for the fathers plite.

Instead it resounds limply, what with everything working out and real change, catharsis completely absent. Scott, despite glowing feelings from other reviews here, seemed bored to me. The direction too left much to be desired, as Scott seems, during one key scene, to be both out of it and riveted, seeing his daughter ""perform."" Scott also has a scene where, perhaps in deference to etiquette (or repressed curiosity?), he allows and ""actor"" to show off his wares. Then later in the game, in a scene between father and daughter there is a hole left gapping, as to what it was that drove her into such a world.

For a time piece, of a world where porn and sex weren't as in-your-face as today, Hardcore has significance. When porn films switched titles constantly and were cast out of the classifieds, Hardcore also has a weight.

Watching Scott delve into this world in various Leisure Suit Larry get-ups going from peep-show to bondage house is laughable.  The film seems more concerned about displaying every form of perversion than about finding Scott's exploited daughter.  It's a credit to Scott's superior acting ability that the film and not he appear silly.  It would also have helped that we knew a little more about his daughter for us to sympathize with his plight.  Peter Boyle also gives a commendable performance as the sleazy detective Scott hires to find his daughter, lest people forget that Boyle was a superb character actor before he became a crotchety couch potato on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"".  This film can also be viewed as a decent time-capsule curio of a time when red light districts thrived before the advent of home video and cyber-porn.

7853486,4,6303686737,"The world of pornography has changed so much since I was young. Back then it was a taboo item, something sold from beneath the counter at the local drugstore or with boards covering all but the titles of the magazine. Movies were 8mm reels sold from those magazines. They moved on to feature films shown in seedy locations in larger cities until the late seventies when an air of respectability was bestowed on them as couples rather than raincoat wearing men began to frequent those theaters.

With the age of video pornography got a fast forward into more mainstream areas. Now people could order these movies delivered in brown paper wrappers to their homes where they would watch in privacy over and over again. So invasive was the world of porn that the formats chosen down the line were determined by the industry since more porn films were sold than mainstream ones.

Now the world of pornography has taken over the internet with the majority of online websites offered one form or another. There are numerous stars of the industry now where once there were only a few recognizable names. Mainstream Hollywood and celebrities have also embraced some members either dating, marrying or featuring these stars in mainstream roles. Theyve become millionaires. But once it wasn't like this.

That early world of porn was filled with wayward teens looking to earn money while living on the streets. Committing unspeakable acts and at times placing their lives in danger it was a seedy world. And from that seedy world writer/director Paul Schrader showed us how bad it could be in a movie that will stick with you long after the final credits role.

George C. Scott stars as Jake VanDorn, a strict conservative Calvinist raising his young daughter Kristen in the heartland. When she goes missing on a planned youth trip to California, Jake hires private detective Andy Mast (Peter Boyle) to find her. What Mast discovers is that Kristen is now involved in the porn business. Jake heads to LA to learn more about what happened. When Mast shows him the footage he came across Jake is crushed but still determined to find his daughter.

Feeling that Mast isn't doing as much as he can Jake delves into the world of hardcore pornography, posing as a director in search of new talent with the hope of coming across one of the actors in the film he saw. His intent is to get a lead from one of them as to who has his daughter and where he can find her. Along the way he gains the help of a porn actress Niki (Season Hubley) and more help from Mast.

Jakes journey into the scummier side of the porn industry is what makes up most of the film. Backroom screening locations of films that show the worst there is to find as well as a snuff film eventually would deter the most hopeful father. Jake qualifies as he continues his search. The men he comes into contact with leave him disgusted and fearing the worst but he carries forward. Whether he will find his daughter or if she will become the latest victim in a snuff film isn't answered until the film is near an end.

The movie takes off the glamour image that many tried to paint on the pornography business at the time it was released in 1979. It showed behind the scenes glimpses of what life was like in the industry composed of drug addicted stars, criminals with no care for human life and uncaring individuals who feigned affection while caring for little more than the cash they could derive from their casts. Many now claim that the business better than ever and that criminal elements are no longer involved. After watching this thats hard to believe with the amount of money to be made now.

Scott turns in his usual amazing performance here. As the tormented Jake he has such a strong conviction of faith that is tested on every level. It is his faith that holds him together both in God and in the hope that his daughter is still alive. We feel both his frustration and his anger as he begins to piece together the puzzle of where his daughter is. We hope as deeply as he does that she has survived and is merely waiting to be rescued.

The rest of the cast does an equally commendable job. Boyle is particularly sleazy but a hero none the less. His character is one who has lived on these mean streets and understand them, passing no judgement on the surface but retaining something inside. Hubley may not be the hooker with a heart of gold type character here but she too has something buried inside of her that makes her want to do what is right. Deep inside she dreams that Jake will rescue her from her life choices along with his daughter. Her character is perhaps the saddest of them all.

HARDCORE is a movie that will disturb on a deep level but it is a movie that needs to be seen. Even more so young people need to see this to find out more about just how glamorous the industry is. It is a cautionary tale and one that will hold you in its grip from start to finish.

Twilight Time has released a great looking copy of the film with a blu-ray image that is the best you will find for this film. Included in the extras are an isolated score track, audio commentary with writer/director Schrader, audio commentary with film historians Eddy Friedfeld, Lee Pfeiffer and Paul Scrabo and the original theatrical trailer. As with all Twilight Time releases the pressing is only 3,000 copies so if you're interested pick one up before they are gone.",1502323200,2,5414,4.5482546201232035
