5726616,5,B00CMDPTJ0,I gave this movie 5 stars because it is full of great Kung Fu action.  There is some humor in the movie which contributes to its entertainment.,1379030400,4,143,4.296296296296297
5726617,4,B00CMDPTJ0,"This is another new Mill Creek set of 12 martial arts movies from the 1970's and 1980's.  They are not restored or remastered.  Many are fullscreen cropped, others are cropped letterbox which I will call widescreen for this review.  The image quality is not very good on most of them, but they are watchable in my opinion.  Many of the movies are known by more than one name.  The audio in this set is all English dubbed with no alternate audio and no subtitles as far as I can tell.  No special features, just 12 movies. I don't think any of these are on the Mill Creek set of 50 martial arts movies.

There are better versions of some of these movies available but for the price this is a decent collection if you don't already have most of these in your library.

5726623,4,B00CMDPTJ0,11 of the 12 movies are horrendous but crazy horse intelligent monkey is hilarious and mostly in a good way. The fight in the chicken coop is funny beyond words. My brother and i were laughing hysterically through most of the film. It stars dean shek who is a fabulous comedic actor whom you may know from some jackie chan movies. Most notably as the hilarious restaurant owner from fearless hyena 2. Crazy tiger excellent monkey is the only reason to buy the set and is why i give a 4 star rating,1459036800,,497,4.354838709677419

5726628,4,B00CMDPTJ0,"These films are rare or hard to find at least. I really liked 10 outta 12 of the flicks,so I have no regrets buying this bundle. Only one flick jumps very little and it pauses twice but its still worth a watch since it was among my favorites. So don't panic as you view ""Crazy Horse,Intelligent Monkey"" on disc 3. It has a few other flaws such as muffled sound during ""Wu Tang Magic Kick"" and a short lack of English dialogue in only one flick on disc one. Great buy regardless.",1442707200,5,478,4.206521739130435
