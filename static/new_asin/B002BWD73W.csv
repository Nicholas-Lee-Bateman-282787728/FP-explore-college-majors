3896875,5,B002BWD73W,"I admit I'm a few years late to this particular party, but I definitely feel the need to post a review to give a nod of recognition to this excellent series. Welcome to the NHK is part comedy/part drama. Like all the best comedy it is meaningful, and like the best drama it doesn't take itself too seriously. Sato is a hikikomori: (I hope I spelled that right) basically an unemployed hermit who fears the pressures of the outside world. How Sato reacts to the outside world is a source of most of the humor.

First, I'd like to rave a little about the characters. ALL the noteworthy characters in this show have problems of some sort. Sato's problem is the focus of the show and being a rather self-absorbed person his perspective doesn't allow him to learn that much about the people around him. As a viewer we can empathize with Misaki and Yamazaki (God, I hope I'm getting these name's right) his two closest friends. To avoid spoiling too much let's just say that Misaki is a young girl who apparently wants to help Sato overcome his problems for no reason other than kindness and Yamazaki is an Otaku with rage issues.

The animation is excellent with a few exceptions. A couple shows look terrible and it makes me wonder if they intentionally designed them that way because it is sooo different than the rest of the show. The music is amazing and really sets the mood of the series. (I especially like ""Dancing Baby Human"" the ending song for the first disk or so)

The high point of the show, however, is not so much the things that happen to the characters, (although some rather extreme situations do crop up) but how the characters react to their situations. Sato's first reaction to any situation tends to be addiction and escapism and it's easy to see why. The introspective sessions which follow these boughts of hedonist revelry tend to be brutal and tainted with what can only be called psychosis. Misaki is a puzzle at first, but the seeds of her character are planted from the start. The neighbor and best friend Yamazaki is much more complex than he appears. His abrasive behavior and misogynistic rants are a product of real pain, and the writers do a great job of making his character sympathetic despite his many faults.

If you're interested in character studies and psychology (the ""dream analysis"" scene is the funniest thing I have seen in ages) than buy this series immeadiately. Some people will be put off by the numerous reverances to ""deviant"" Japanese culture, but it wouldn't be a very honest show if factors like internet pornography and hentai games didn't enter into it at some point.",1281571200,,2620,4.652267818574514
3896876,5,B002BWD73W,"This is one of the comedies/dramas of anime that does not have characters too goofy or rediculous. I actually managed to laugh a good amount of times while watching this series and it is not easy to get me to laugh. Most of us should have no problem relating to this anime series because it is about an anti social person.

Tatsuhiro (the main character) never goes outside unless its night and he needs food. He blames the NHK for all of his problems. He is called a neat (a hermit that never leaves his house). Then one day a girl (Misaki) comes up to his door and tries to sell him a magazine about neats. She later tells him that she wants to cure him of being a neat. He eventually agrees and they go through and over come many challenges and of course Tatsuhiro falls in love with her.

This is an amazing anime that will leave with a different perspective on life after you finish it. If you were anti social at one point in your life you will love this anime and even if you were not you still probably will enjoy it. All of the characters are easy to relate to and you can always manage to find some humor in every situation. I do not recommend this series for people under the ages of 16 because of all the suggestive themes.",1279843200,2,1235,4.206751054852321

3896879,5,B002BWD73W,"I own and have watched many animes, but this one stands out as a fairly unique series. First i'd like to say that this series is not a gory hack-n-slash with shotouts with zombies demons and aliens being resurected to take over the world. Nope not at all, this series is likely to have alot in comon with the people who watch animes for the Mature Humor. the Series is basicaly about what hapens to a person if he shuts himself away from the world and the toll it can take on the mind. It has alot finer points to it that you normaly don't see in animes like the *Real Life Factor* no magic, no guns, no swords, well actualy it does have those things but its all in guys mind. There is lots of sexual humor... well I ant gunna write all day soo i'll get to the point.

Its a Psychologicaly Hilariuse Anime.

Its full of things that people would connect and relate too.

Its a fairly deep complex story that can throw people off which may lead to people misjudging it.

Its a College Student Must Watch!

3896880,3,B002BWD73W,"There are some anime properties that you really can't imagine working in any other medium.  Sure anime is very closely related to its manga cousin but comics fail to deliver when things really get zany and personable.  Welcome to the N-H-K is exactly one such property.  It's so unique on so many levels that it's actually hard to believe it came out of the typically conservatively regarded Gonzo studios.  But before we get ahead of ourselves here, let's take a look at the hard facts.

Originally released by ADV Films, Funimation has recently acquired the rights to the show and has wasted little time in getting a Complete Series release out to the public.  Coming in at a total runtime of 600 minutes, Welcome to the N-H-K the Complete Series spans 4 discs and comes packaged as a pair of thin packs within a cardboard slipcase.

The show wears an appropriate TV MA (17+) rating, which is surprising should you base the show on the previews alone (a more accurate depiction of what's in store would be to check out the cover art and its foaming can of beer, pair of scantily clad women, and lead character looking slightly neurotic).

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning the option of original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or an English dub (5.1 Dolby Surround) and English subtitles available under either language choice.

Extras are limited to textless songs and a host of Funimation trailers.

I'll do my best to summarize the story without giving away any spoilers.  The viewer is introduced to Sato, a college dropout who has just about had all he can take of society.  So withdrawn from society is our hero that he locks himself up in his dreary apartment where his very grip on reality is becoming more and more twisted by the day.

His own delusions coupled to his lack of outside contact result in his becoming convinced that he is the subject of a vast conspiracy designed keep him under wraps by the secretive agency known as the N-H-K.

Like most mentally ill individuals, being a delusion-suffering recluse results in a twist of incredible fortune when a friendly, pretty, and just generally good hearted young lady named Misaki shows up one day out of the blue with intentions of getting old depressed Sato back into society.

The lead character pair ends up becoming a trio once the loud-music bumping neighbor of Sato's (and an old high-school pal, it turns out) joins the fray.  In all this unlikely team makes it their mission to rehabilitate the ever-degenerating mental and social health of Sato through a sort of long and drawn out intervention.

Believe it or not, this is a comedy anime title despite what you may have figured after reading the summary.  It's based on a novel, which although I haven't had the pleasure of reading personally, can't possibly capture the oddity and personality that the anime just relishes in around every corner.

 The core of the show alternates between a cityscape reality and the hallucinations of Sato, which sometimes border on sexual fantasies.  I should note that there is no real nudity involved in said scenarios, but rather provocative outfits and a bit of suggestive dialog.  It is the language that earns this show a majority of its MA rating here in the US.

A lot of the show's charm stems from the age-old gag of presenting a fairly ""out there"" conspiracy theory that can never fully be dismissed by the viewer.  The show's creative team does a great job painting a lead character who is clearly suffering from social dysfunction although there are moments along the way where you can't help but wonder if indeed some other forces (like a top-secret agency for example) aren't at play.

The biggest problem I had with the show is that it lacks consistency in nearly sense of the term.  There are some genuinely funny moments but they are few and far between.  There are some intriguing psychological undertones that slip away to cheap attempts at humor.  There are some nice textures and visuals on occasion but more often than not you'll be looking at art that simply gets the job done.  About the only aspect of this program that holds steady is the soundtrack, which includes some smooth melodies and catchy J-Pop numbers throughout.

The acting work is solid in both language options, with the Japanese dialog squeaking into the top-spot thanks to a female actor ensemble that feel almost custom tailored to the material.

In all, this is definitely not a show for everyone, nor is the silly/ goofy type of light-hearted romp that previews suggest.  It's really a tragic tale if you allow yourself to look beyond the bright visuals and giddy personalities that make up the superficial.  Pacing is nice and swift even if the show does struggle at times to firmly establish itself into a genre.",1250726400,87,4787,4.77764277035237

3897026,5,B002BWD73W,"I was literally exhausted from laughter after one of the episodes. The only other anime that has come close to being as funny as this one, is School Rumble. Actually I take that back, because no other anime comes close over all. I am afraid I will ruin some thing if I comment on the contents much. I guess I have to though. We have a guy who is supported by his parents to attend college in Tokyo, only he dropped out about 4 years ago after being thoroughly embarrassed socially. He subsequently locked himself up in his one-room apartment coming out only to get to the convenience store and to take an occasional trip to the neighborhood park.  He receives an offer to help with his NEET problem from a young girl who came to his door accompanying her aunt in a ministry work passing out pamphlets. He winds up getting involved with society once again gradually over time, and the hilarity ensues. This is one of the funniest anime out there. I probably found it that way because it hits close to home which says a lot more about myself than I would like, but this psychological humor and conspiracy theory stuff along with the well built characters, as well as a well focused story, make ""Welcome to the N-H-K"" a great show. It is a totally different story and theme, but I put it right with my other Anime favorites. Black lagoon, The Twelve Kingdoms., and others. This show is nothing like those, but it is just as well written. In my opinion the story and theme are a masterpiece. Some of the comedy is a bit twisted, but some of it is funny I don't care who you are. It is much more real to life than Outbreak Company, and it gives a real peek into the actual life of a NEET, much more believable than ""Heaven's Memo Pad"". If you don't get it by the end of the second or third episode, I guess you should move on. I could see people getting puzzled after only one episode, so give it more of a chance than that I guess, though I don't think most will be too confused by it, definitely not any Anime fans. If you bust a gut or wet yourself don't say I didn't warn you.",1459728000,,2075,4.266497461928934

Nothing has quite lived up to Death Note in my mind so far.  BUT Welcome to the NHK made me fall in love with the possibility of anime in a whole other way.  This is a straight up drama.  It is very dark, but remains funny and watchable.  And even  if you cant relate to why somebody would lock himself in his home (lots of us can!), you still care about whats going on.  Yeah, it is weird, like many reviewers say.  But this is an example of what anime can do that a lot of other mediums probably just wouldnt attempt, at least on this level.

Sadly when we talk about anime most people think about squeaky girls with huge boobs, big, doe eyes and males fantasy.

3897174,4,B002BWD73W,"(Reader note: my review is based on the Japanese dialog version, not the English dub.)
I'm glad I stuck it out with this series, because initially, I was put off by the craziness and the anthropomorphic animation in the first episode. But it gets better as it progresses, and by episode 5, you'll be hooked.
This is a largely negative world view story, but the situations that many viewers will find personally identifiable will have you yelling ""YES!! I've BEEN there!"" whether it's the multilevel marketing scheme where you demonstrated detergents by dissolving them in glasses of water (yup, did that forty years ago), or the struggle to write video games, or the problems of just coming out of your apartment after adjusting to a lifestyle of being alone for too long, it's all in there. Anyone who's had a dysfunctional past will immediately identify with the main character, Tatsuhiro Sato.
One of the strong appealing characters in this series is Misaki Nakahara, the ""girl next door"", who one day, happens upon Sato's apartment while doing door to door visits with her aunt's religious group. She is largely a mysterious character for most of the show's run, but in the last few episodes we learn of her unfortunate and dysfunctional past, making her one of the more tragic characters whom we feel sympathy for.
Sato is constantly scheming with Kaoru Yamazaki, an underclassman whom he knew from school, and the source of annoying ""Puru Puru Pururin"" theme music that seems to constantly play on his computer in the apartment next door. Kaoru convinces Sato to help him write and produce computer video games, called ""Gal Games"" to appeal to the ""hentai"" anime fans in the marketplace. He's scheming, always coming up with ideas to ""make it big"" and Sato gets suckered into it all because he wants to convince Misaki that he's up to something productive and that he'll make a good living at it one day.
Another notable character from Sato's past is Hitomi Kashiwa. She was his upper classman in high school and a fellow conspiracy theorist. Her attitude is somewhat dark and malevolent, because of her deep immersion in conspiracy beliefs, and probably influenced Sato into becoming the somewhat negative person he was throughout this series. She makes recurring appearances from time to time and is a fascinating personality.
As the episodes progress, a series of interesting circumstances arise and often, they are situations that could be a chapter out of the lives of any person who has tried many ways to make a living.
The conclusion isn't nearly as satisfying as I'd have liked, but there are hints that things will go in a better direction. Still, I would have liked to see Sato have more trust in Misaki.
This is a series which I will watch again in the future. It's certainly one to make you think about aspects of life that we don't frequently give much thought to. While I'm not crazy about the animation, most of the character designs or the music, the do work well together and this is more of a story about ideas. If you love a drama that relates to events in your past and stimulates thought about what is our purpose in life, you may find this series enjoyable.

The main character has hallucinations, a nervous breakdown, and struggles to continue living like a neet. He meets pressures of parents, suicide pacts, going through therapy and so forth. These are characters that you desperately hope that their lives get better, but once they don't, it's the funniest thing to come across.

3897178,5,B002BWD73W,"Run for the hills!  This isn't Harem but looks like it.  This isn't blood-soaked ninjas driving mechs either.  ""Welcome to the NHK"" is a unique and hilariously depressing look at a sweeping epidemic of agoraphobic culture that's already here in the states, but is so solidified in Japan that it's coined a culture and an acronym, N.E.E.T. (No Employment, Education or Training).

While we have a thousand and one reasons to stay in our apartments and never leave, our main character has agoraphobia and doesnt need those internet trinkets to help keep him indoors.  Now he will be introduced.  This show tracks his progress and pitfalls as he discovers all the new reasons to never see sunlight.  Porn, World of Warcraft, Ponzi schemes, suicide cults, video game design, and laughing, purple conspiracies are just a fraction of the gauntlet our hero must face when deciding whether or not its worth opening the door and dealing with anyone.

This show also makes sure that any outsider who manages to break into his Fortress of Solitude (made of empty beer cans), also carries their own realistic baggage packed full of psychological flotsam.

NHKs narrative can drag at times, but is oddly powerful.  The comedy is nerve racking and the emotions are crushing at times.  This show will blindside you with some heavy concepts and human suffering if you're not careful and just expect him to quiver around girls all day.

This is a hard show to recommend; 26 EPISODES ABOUT A GUY NEVER LEAVING HIS APARTMENT. Insecure fan boys might not like the mirror it holds up.  Many will find it outright boring.  The conclusion at the end is anything but epic, but instead is highly realistic and sobering.

To speak of its production value; the animation is very smooth and well done.  The music is catchy and fits perfectly with the shows tone.  The dialogue is bipolar and shifts quickly between pensive comedic stabs and somberly charming ballads.

The fact that its on S.A.V.E. makes it a safer purchase.  Take a chance on it, but know what you're getting yourself into.  Welcome to the NHK is hard to market, because it reminds adults of the child trapped inside, and reminds children of the adult waiting inevitably for them in the future.

Welcome to a truly admirable slice of life.",1387929600,11,2279,4.822164948453608
3897249,5,B002BWD73W,"Interesting. It goes nowhere near the average high-school-anime cliche. The depth of the subject matter (being a shut-in agoraphobe, suicide, sex in media, etc) and the lack of naivete makes it as decent to watch as a good book is to read.",1386028800,,239,4.714285714285714
3897250,5,B002BWD73W,This anime is truly one of a kind. Currently one of my favorites. The life of a hikikomori is perfectly portrayed in this wonderful series.,1385856000,,139,4.6
3897251,5,B002BWD73W,"There is nothing in anime, film, or television that is quite like this show. I've searched far and wide for years, but nothing has ever captured my emotions this well. Welcome to the NHK is about a hikikimori (a shut in) who believes his life is surrounded by conspiracy. He has no job, lives off of his parents money, and is afraid to even step outside of his small apartment.

When a mysterious girl appears in his life and wants to help him get out of this lifestyle for no apparent reason, his time in limbo ends and he starts a journey of self-discovery. It's a fairly simple plot but it's portrayed so well. Even though I am not necessarily a shut in myself, I can easily relate to the characters as they deal with failures, social anxieties, and the feelings that everyone is looking down on them.

There are points when the show has its ups and downs, especially when it comes to the quality of the animation, but I've always found the situations entertaining in a way that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. It's a really great balance and something that is sometimes pretty difficult to find in the world of anime.

I would recommend this to anyone who has ever felt intense feelings of loneliness or depression. I guarentee it will hit straight to home. It did for me, and even helped inspire me to get out of a rut that I've been in for years. It is imperfect, it has many flaws, but it is unique in such a way that it is likely my favorite anime series of all time.

There are plenty of times I'm really in the mood to watch it again, but I've decided to limit myself to once per year, as I don't ever want this anime to lose interest to me.  I would have to say it's almost perfect.  The situations are pretty realistic to me, maybe a little over the top which adds some hilarity to the show, but it's all in the realm of realism as far as social and psychological issues people have.  I love all the characters and oddly enough I feel everyone can relate to Sato in some way.  Like I said, everything in this series is about perfect to me as far as characters, animation, music, storyline and pace.  The story moves along nicely, never too slow or too quickly.  Other than those tangible things, there is just something about the series that really connects with me, almost on some sort of deeper spiritual level.  I wish there were more anime I left this way about, but there simply aren't.  Welcome to the NHK is something special.  If you're on the fence about this one, I definitely suggest giving it a shot.  It's an absolute classic IMO.  I know others who regard it as highly as me as well.  And shockingly enough, I've heard people say they didn't care for it.

This anime is based of a novel which became a manga which became an anime ha. If you can, I would suggest also buying the novel. To be honest, I don't know where to start to explain this story. This anime is actually one of the most down to earth anime's I've ever had the pleasure to watch. Don't let the boxart fool you or the fact that it is even an anime fool you, most of the ""characters"" are based upon people in general with the many problems and difficulties we face in life. I wouldn't recommend this to a younger viewer of anime as in this is mature rated, most of the scenes a younger viewer will most likely not identify with it. This anime does not have any supernatural elements to it, like many anime do. The only supernatural thing I can think of, I guess would be that the main character hallucinates throughout the series, which is all explained. Actually a difference between the novel and anime would be that the anime left out the fact that the main character Sato during times would be taking drugs and it would cause his hallucinations. Being that there is so much to explain, I recommend this to anyone of certain age. Even if you don't like anime, I guarantee this will touch you in a way. This anime will make you feel all kinds of emotions, if you can't identify with neither character then I would wonder if you were human. It starts off looking into the average life of 21 yr old Sato who basically is a N.E.E.T and Hikkimori which is a Japanese term which a lot of people aren't familiar with because it's common amongst many people in general but Japan basically has a term for it. You could look up these term for more info. Immediately you get introduced to the main character within this first episode. His character and personality is so easy to identify and very likeable. In all honesty, I guarantee if you give this a chance you will watch it more than once and in cases it might help you out in the long run, of your life. Very realistic, very different, very enjoyable, there's just so much to like about this anime. I'm sure other reviewers can give more details on the series, but I can't find words to say. In just 26 episodes, this anime fledges out a life story. Worth a try and especially for the price of the S.a.v.e edition by Funimation which has nothing to do with quality it's just a whole lot easier on the wallet.

He convinces himself that a group called the NHK (Nihon Hikkikomori Kyoukai) is out to get him and turn the entire country into NEETs. One day a pretty high school girl named Misaki visits him and offers to give him counseling to cure his hikkikomori condition. The 2 become closer and begin to rely on each other. As their relationship strengthens Satou is able to venture out and do things on his own. Lot's of drama and comedy ensue.

This anime is completely different from anything I've ever seen. It dark and methodical vibe are complemented by the main characters hilarious paranoia and perverted imagination. The production is top notch. Animation and music are all very good. It also stars 2 of my favorite voice actors, Chris Patton and Luci Christian.

3897284,4,B002BWD73W,"The characters were all over the place, some of them being at times very good and at other times despicable, and some of them simply being awesome all anime long. Satou was the perfect example of the `'unperfect'' character, he was great in the beginning since the show was heavily going for comedy, but when it got serious his idiocy tended to get old, he still was a majorly good character since he fuelled all the social problems, but still was at times annoying. The characters in this anime are splendid apart for that small fact, all of them having developed characteristics, behaviours, tics, back-story, goals and development. I would praise the person who built Misaki particularly since she was a very nice character with a lot of background and a very likable and hateable personality at the same time; I particularly like her slick manipulative side. She will definitively go down in my memory for being one of the best female leads I have ever seen.  The only downside to the characters is that after episode 10 we seem to cast aside the main duo and their development together, thus further hurting the romantic mood established in the first part. By doing it develops the side characters, but some of the development seemed too much for them. All in all, it was an amazing cast, if only Satou wouldn't have been such an idiot sometimes, but that stupidity actually helps building the story; so it's not all bad.
The art was frankly the most disappointing part of the anime, since it was at times very sloppy, it seems the anime lacked funding in the end, or somewhere along the line and the artwork suffered from that, giving us a lot of still backgrounds. But it was still very befitting and good for the anime; it gave it a sort of ''amateur'' feel which contributed at times to the anime's style.

Even if the animation suffered from this lack of budget, the music did not, it was one of the tremendously well done parts in this anime. It always complemented the anime and simply established the mood lived by the characters perfectly. I cannot see how the music could be unappreciated.

In the end, it gives us an odd and nice mix of a light comedy/romantic slice of life and a depressing and heavy slice of life, it shows us the good of relations and the fact that these relations will end and paths will split. It got hard to love this anime at the time the romance died with the humour, it got heavy and the refreshing mood from the beginning got lost along the way, it almost seemed as it had lost its magic in the second half, but it simply shows us matters from a different viewpoint, not trying to entertain us in the end but make us change some of our ways, or at least be conscious of these saddening facts. It was a great and hard slap to the face to take, and I absolutely loved this anime with all its flaws and all its hard realisations.

I would suggest everyone to at least take a look at this, it's a good critical viewpoint on society and a good anime in general.

You can indeed reverse the slip to remove the UNSIGHTLY green bar around the edge which may as well say ""I.M. C.H.E.A.P."" Not that if you buy this you are cheap in anyway though, the box just would make it seem like that. I personally like the designs on the CDs, and you can tell them apart they are not identical.

I'll jump right into it and talk about some of the pros and cons. I like that not only is there cover art on the front, but because the case itself is transparent, there is art on the inside as well, but my qualm is that it is the exact same image from the cover. It also has a list of episodes on the inside of the cover so you know which episode is on which disk. As with all of the S.A.V.E. edition box sets you will see a green bar on the left of the case, which is normally part of the disposable packaging, however with this particular box set it isn't part of the plastic packaging, but a part of the cover art, which I personally really don't like because you can't get rid of it, and it takes away form the beauty of the cover. The case is the same size and thickness of a normal movie case with two flaps inside it which hold a DVD on each side of them to make four DVD slots. The art on the DVDs is nearly identical between the four of them, with a light grid pattern in the background and a picture of those strange purple creatures seen in the anime. (I honestly don't know what to call them) My only other qualm is with the DVD menu. Unlike most DVDs which have 'play,' 'episodes,' 'settings,' and 'extras' in the main menu, with Welcome to the N.H.K. all the episodes are listed over a background picture, along with languages and clean opening and ending options.

The story begins with the introduction of the main character Satou, who is a Hikikomori.  Meaning that he secludes himself from the outside world.  After his first encounter with Misaki, Satou decides to go search for a job.  He decides to apply at this manga shop, where he runs into Misaki again and runs out of the shop.  This is his first step into starting a new life.  Misaki eventually starts a contract with Satou that is a promise to help him end his Hikikomori ways.

Along the way he also finds out that his neighbor who had been blasting annoying anime music, was actually an old high school classmate, who he had once saved from bullies.  His name is Yamazaki.

With his new friend and old friends Satou struggles to find his way.  Their is triumph and failures along the way and Satou must struggle through the emotional roller-coaster.

If you know what it is like to want to close yourself off to the outside world, you will understand what Satou is going through.

3897389,5,B002BWD73W,"Anime is one of the great joys of my life.  I tend to research my shows before viewing, scoping reviews before renting or hooking up the laptop, because I would hate to waste any of my precious watching time on a load of crap.  It has unfortunately happened a few times, and I'm always piqued when it does.  On the other hand, I've also seen some animes so good, so well done, that my expectations were exceeded.  Enter Welcome to the NHK.

 I think what appealed to me most about this series was it's realism.  NHK is not a college drama; its action exists rather on the fringes of this environment.  However, for those of us who have entered a college away from home, and have experienced the type of world within which Satou, Yamizaki, and Misaki survive, this show is about as true-to-life as you can get.  For many of us, college did not offer the experiences portrayed in movies like ""Animal House"" or ""Van Wilder""; its aftermath--joblessness for many--is simply too disheartening for most comedies.  NHK nods towards those who strive on the outskirts to realize some great dream, no matter how trivial others might think it.  We see the underbelly of life as a 20-something college drop-out, with the depression, loneliness, and unemployment that often accompanies it.

 That being said, this is a comedy, and a really good one.  I've noticed some reviews claiming that NHK is depressing, but frankly I can't see it.  While the problems it wrestles with are real (internet suicide, multi-level marketing, MMO addiction, to name a few), NHK never becomes bogged down in its own subject matter.  The characters remain sympathetic and likable, and the show holds tight to its humor throughout.  What we get is a show that understands the failings of young people faced with city life, but one that believes that life finds a way.  We may not end up where we want to be, and we may not be better off for it, but we live.

 If you think you might enjoy a story about the interactions between disparate yet equally socially repressed characters, then this show may be for you.  If you enjoy slice-of-life animes in general, then please watch this immediately.  Definitely the best show I've seen this year.",1309478400,,2207,4.70757180156658
3897390,5,B002BWD73W,"considering that almost everyone I have met in the US that are avid fans of anime have not heard of this series saddens me especially when this is one of my favorite series. I even met a guy cosplaying as the ""H Ningen/Human"" thing carrying around a big sign with ""THE NHK IS A CONSPIRACY!"" written on it at one of the biggest anime conventions in the US and he said I was the ONLY one that recognized his costume all day. truely a great series that touches on many subjects that most would like to avoid, ranging from phobia of social interaction to suicide and conspiracy theories. I will recommend this series to anyone that loves anime, since it really gives an idea of how things are like for many people in Japan and many of the social issues they have to deal with. since the series deals with a NEET/Hikikimori as the main character, it may resonate with many outside of Japan, especially when NEETs and Hikis are becoming more prevalent in other countries like the UK as well.

If you haven't seen this already and are willing to have a fun time while learning about some Japanese social issues, I highly recommend it. who knows, it might even make you re-examine yourself or others you know.

as to the actual product, the SAVE version is a pretty good deal, its cheap enough so that most cash strapped anime fans can afford it. though you have to remember that its a no-frills release, its just a small box with the DVDs crammed inside, even the DVD data is no frills, they squished as many episodes on the DVDs as they could. the only complain I have to Funimation is that they don't include the original high quality Japanese audio, its just plain stereo when the cruddy english dub gets the full surround sound makeover. One thing I wish they could do is just have the original Japanese videos, with an option for english subtitles and english translated menus. there are many fans out there like me who never touch the English dubs, wouldnt it be better if they can shave a good amount of cost by just releasing a non-english dubbed version? that way the savings can be passed down to the consumers by lowering the production cost. I am also personally against dubbing of anything in a foreign language, since almost always, when a dubbing is done, much of the meaning and feeling behind the original work is lost due to a variety of reasons, including the fact that it is impossible to perfectly translate between languages and also the cultural differences as well. This is especially true when translating languages from different roots and radically different cultural backgrounds like Japanese to English.

enough with the rant, If you are looking for a slice of life/drama series that will enlighten you, N'H'K''''''(NHK ni youkoso! ""Welcome to the NHK!"") is a great choice.",1301961600,,2795,4.642424242424243

The way that society treats losers is sad, which is effortlessly illustrated in the anime.  This anime changed my life and the way I viewed the world.  Rather than seeming like a documentary, Welcome to the NHK made me laugh out loud, gasp, and snicker all at the same time.  There's nothing else to compare it too. You'll just have to watch it.",1298937600,2,498,4.689655172413793
3897392,5,B002BWD73W,"This is a series I have wanted to watch for a long time. Another that was featured in NEO magazine a couple of years back but as always the UK release of anime lags behind the American releases.  I always try and wait for a box set and seeing the SAVE edition I just had to treat myself.

The series eases you into the daily life of a shut-in, socially inept, waster of a young man who had just turned 22. He's been out of college and out of work for four years.  Now I am 22 myself and just finished college myself so for the last few months I've been feeling a bit like a hikkikomori myself.  It makes me rethink my life that it needs to go beyond helping out the family business or bantering around with the people in the boys club/karate dojo.

The series is a little disturbing at times in how extreme it can take things, how a lonely, depressed guy things and especially when he is ""comfortable"" in his own little bubble (for example living day-by-day on instant foods, porn, games, dodgy anime music). It also portrays a little bit of the psychotic and paranoia.  You find yourself rooting for Sato (the protagonist) despite all that and his journey into a ""normal"" life through the help of a girl who has taken pity on him and provides him with counseling and daily goals.

I watched it in the Japanese dub with English subtitles. I would consider a rewatch in English though since one of the other reviews mentioned it. But since the hikkikomori problem is probably more common in Japan and its otaku culture  I think watching the series in Japanese is ok too.  This series touches on some themes from the series ""Chobits"" by CLAMP... the personal computer/ persocom. The longing for company... the sex (apparatus/tools/dolls/imagery)... and the remedial classes/NEET (neither in education, employment nor training).

If you are an anime/game/Japan nerd, give this series a go. You won't be disappointed.",1298764800,4,1913,4.633136094674557
3897393,5,B002BWD73W,"When I first caught wind of this anime I was seriously unaware of what I was getting myself into. Needless to say the NHK is definitely my FAVORITE anime I've seen in my course of geeking out over this sort of show. I've been an avid anime watcher for the last 7 years (I'm 22 now). The last few years of my anime watching has been rather lack luster, however, when I got a hold of a copy of Welcome to the NHK, I was astounded and pleased to see that SOMEONE (ie: the producer) had a mind about him when he made this show!

To sum it up in so many words, this anime is so absurd, yet at the same time, you could totally see this happening in the real world. The story follows a character who could easily be anyone and the several supporting characters also complimented for similar, yet differentiating aspects of the ""shut-in"" types (meaning that there are more-types of shuts ins than just the people who don't leave their houses). Ignore the description on the back of the box; it doesn't do it justice whatsoever and it's much deeper than the surface moe/porn jokes/cliche anime syndromes that many series' lately have fallen into). Quite the contrary, this series lends the public with the knowledge that there IS a conspiracy of life out there, however, it's all about how you go about living in it.

From the deeper discussions of philosophical conspiracies, to the downright awkwardness of Satou trying to find his way back into working society, this series is definitely a MUST see and I would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who is looking for something a little bit out of the ordinary, but also looking for a good time!

Some may find this anime a little offensive for some of the content that is within it. You probably wouldn't want to watch this with your grandma (that's for sure) however, it's definitely a good one to watch if you're looking for that laugh with your dirty-minded satirical friends.",1298505600,3,1917,4.550724637681159

  Irk 3: The production QA on these discs was so low I had to return the first set for a bad disc 1.

  Special Features: Disc 2: Also Available - some of these are pretty old. None were very good at describing the series they advertised, others were useless, complete wastes of space. One was for a live action movie, not something I consider useful on an anime series preview list.
  Disc 3: Clean open/close,
  Disc 4: Also Available previews.

  More drama and some situational comedy woven into the storyline than the usual one-liner style comedy. The same with the romantic aspect, it's not so much about love as need. The style changes from a conspiracy/paranoia story about a NEET (shut-in) to struggling game creators (""girl games"") type then on to a love story (that turns out is and isn't). This is a bit confusing at first, but pulls the storyline together well while bringing forward enough info and background to tie it all together. Somewhat unique in dealing with issues of NEETs/Hikikomori, but overall I'd say it's pretty mediocre overall.
  This is one of those animes with a brief bit after the ending credits of the last episode but nothing major. Sit through the end credits once and you'll have seen it and not need to do so again.

3897398,5,B002BWD73W,"This anime isn't for everyone, but it sure as hell was for me. I love shows like FLCL, Cowboy Bebop, Genshiken, and Full Metal Panic.

The main character is a Hikikamori, basically a shut in supported by his parents. He makes a few friends, each with their own set of problems too, who help him to overcome his situation.

This anime is all about the characters and their interaction and development. There's pretty much no action.

Some of the strongest themes are depression, loneliness, social anxiety, and paranoia.

There are also some nice romance aspects in the story that I found very endearing.

I prefer anime in english dub because the original creators intended for their work to be watched, not read. I found the english dub to be quite good. The voice actors did a great job and it definitely adds to the experience.

This set has almost no extra content at all. It has the episodes, a few trailers, and clean opening and closing themes. That's it. Another thing to note is that the green bar on the dvd box is permanent and cannot be removed. It is super ugly and a shame because the box art is pretty good otherwise.

I highly recommend this series if you're into characters more than action. If you like romance but don't like harems and asinine romantic comedies then you'll enjoy this.",1293408000,10,1304,4.619047619047619
3897429,5,B002BWD73W,"Recommend 18+ viewing due to adult themes, smoking, and occasional animated nudity (top only).

The series revolves around a NEET (hikkimori) named Sato: basically a modern day shut-in who watches TV all day and never ventures outside unless absolutely necessary.  Queue the cute but absent minded girl who takes it upon herself to 'change' the main character for the better.  Add a hilarious neighbor and hilarity ensues.  There are a lot of Otaku references, so this is probably not a good intro to anime or Japanese culture, but those familiar with other anime series and modern Japanese society will surely enjoy it.

Oh and one last thing:  Puru puru pururin!!!!!!!!!
Watch the series and you'll get it!
------------------------------------------
Update:  So I watched the entirety and I must say that this series surprised me greatly.  What appears on the surface to be a simple slice of life comedy is actually much more meaningful and deep than the first impression would give.  The series does include a lot of humor and some clever anecdotes on life, and is immensely satisfying for casual viewing but...

The series definitely takes a dramatic turn and all of the sudden, real life rears its ugly head.  This series touches on a world wide problem with youth who are unable to adapt to the modern world and hectic pace of life today.  What Italian directors portrayed in the 60s is shown in this series.  Inability to adapt brings out the latent neurosis is some people.  Most of the characters exhibit this to some extent.  Most find ways to adapt, though they aren't completely 'cured', which is all very realistic.  There are references to Freud and Jung throughout, even the 'lessons' by Misaki feature the works of Jung.

This is truly a black comedy, rife with angst, pain, suicide, social anxiety, love, questioning existence and god, and finally acceptance.  What I took from this series is that everybody has their share of problems, especially in a world where it is so easy to remove oneself from society, but that there is hope for some happiness.  Truly an existential work and one that is so deeply layered and complex beneath the surface that it is well worth viewing many times over the years.

The only con would be the animation is rudimentary in some instances, disappointing since I know Gonzo is capable of perfection (i.e. Last Exile).

Please view with Japanese language and English subtitles for the true effect of this series.",1292544000,2,2462,4.912832929782082

The main character, Sato, a college dropout who suddenly became a phobic social recluse, a ""hikikomori"" as it is known in Japan. After a few years, he begins to formulate theories of conspiracies against him and makes a desperate attempt to get his life back.

Having an anxiety disorder myself, I was able to really empathize with a lot of what the main character was going through (minus the more neurotic habits).

A wonderful anime series with an original story, highly likable characters and a strong plot. Definitely reccomend it for any anime fan who enjoys a comedic series.",1291075200,,753,4.913385826771654
3897432,5,B002BWD73W,"Welcome to the NHK is one of the best anime that I have ever seen.

It is a 'realistic' anime set in the year of 2006 in Tokyo Japan.  This series fell under the cracks of main stream anime audience, and maybe because it is series without suer-human ninjas or giant mecha.  For really good reviews of this anime look under the Box Set edition dated for 2009 on anime.  There are over a dozen reviews on Welcome to the NHK that you'll get a good perspective into the series.  Each review in that thread is full of unique philosophical insight -- which shows the power of this series.

The series does start off somewhat slow and wired in nature.  The story focuses on the depressive state of the main character, and someone who is mainstream might not get into the series right off the bat.  That being said the anime progresses very nicely and the characters become fully developed towards the end.  The relationships between all of the characters is what steals the show of the anime and serves as the backbone of series.  There are no filer episodes in Welcome to the NHK as everything is continuous.

The soundtracks is above average and quiet endearing and I'd rate the animation above average as well.

Pick up Welcome to the NHK in either it's box set form or through this S.A.V.E package.

If you enjoy romance, if you enjoy character relationships and interactions, if you enjoy true creativity and solid writing in your shows then Welcome to the NHK is for you.

--Once again.  See the reviews in the Box Set Edition (2009) to get a better idea of the series.",1290816000,40,1568,4.51063829787234
3897433,3,B002BWD73W,"Interesting anime you get to see through the eyes of the Japanese culture. Its kind of like therapy and cheerleading for the hikikomori or recluse. Though Japanese society of course is portrayed as totally blameless, it is highly taboo in Japan to question the structure of their society, likewise the Japanese family structure is shown as above question and totally blameless. Never mind I'm sure many of the hikikomori were victims of abuse and neglect in the nuclear family. The crushing spiritual weight of the Japanese educational system and career expectations are likewise not give air time. All the reasons for Satou withdrawing totally from society are goofy and simply don't resonate. The anime simply doesnt have the guts to challenge Japanese society on any deep level and kind of feeds into the superstitions and invectives used on hikikomori. They had some silly emotional rejection, they withdrew, society is great and they just need to pull it together and get moving.
 So really if the anime refuses to deal with these mammoth social problems in Japan I have to question how helpful this anime was really to the hikikomori. Could it really resonate with them? Or does it just make them blame themselves even more for their inability or lack of desire to connect with Japanese culture in the 'normal' way. Perhaps just bringing the issue to light in a way that isn't totally negative is pleasant for the hikikomori, here is hoping so.
 Taken purely as entertainment its got its moments. Some of the more wacky scenes are quite a bit of fun and some of the scenes work on an emotional level. There are also moments of humor but some of it is heavily ingrained in the Japanese culture of strick social rules so it loses a bit of impact to Westerners. Some of the episodes feel contrived and feel like an American 'after school special', an example of this would be the death pact group. The anime's intentions were good but it just felt heavy.
 The anime is overall enjoyable and worth watching but it is hit or miss most definitely. I would give it 3.5*'s if I could but I cant.",1289347200,2,2093,4.728767123287671

Well this is definitely an adult anime, uh maybe a little too adult if you ask me.  Sometimes curse words just get used to make the show seem more mature; and the chauvinistic sexuality gets a little annoying at times but the show manages to carry on through the really dumb parts to actually be somewhat refreshing in the homogenized world of anime.

If you can enjoy a piece of life anime where the main character is battling a chronic masturbation addiction then this one is for you.  Definitely not saying that is a (good) reason to like it.",1288915200,,704,4.303030303030303

The story revolves around the psychological and social challenges of Tatsuhiro Satou and other characters. These include lack of self-confidence, yearning for sympathy, poor social skills, love, and many other emotional pains. With all this, ""Welcome to the N.H.K"" maintains a very truthful and emotional approach to life especially with a relating author. The anime also shows how ordinary people have painful pasts and deficiencies ""deep down inside"" or in their lives. Such a presentation provides the acknowledgement and understanding that it is okay and not ""creepy"" to have issues. Certainly, the characters can lead different lives from a typical young person. Also, some of Satou's subconscious thoughts are illustrated strangely and outrageously wild. However, that keeps this anime constantly funny and embarrassing.

It's a romantic dramady focusing on lives of Otaku.  The driving aspect of this anime is it's realism, it has a certain charm that makes the story, stick.  It has a dark theme to it, but just when it becomes to much they spice it up with a dash of comedy and a pinch of romance. I would have given this anime five stars, however one aspect bothered me.  Certain episodes within the series just slowed down the plot completely.  They were unneeded and had almost nothing to do with character development.  This series is great, but if those were dropped it would have been flawless.

  Animation style was relaxed and in a way very crisp.  The art was stimulating to the eyes and never really took away from the series.  In certain scenes the artists used a very dark undertone yet never making it feel too dark, a perfect mix.  In the animation department, I have no real complaints, the artists were spot on.

  The soundtrack was also hit the spot.  The soundtrack fits the tone of the story and really sets the mood.  It never feels as if they dragged out any of the music and kept it fairly simple.  It never became to dark or to fluffy and the soundtrack kept perfect balance.
