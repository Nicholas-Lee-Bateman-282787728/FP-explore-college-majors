8648988,5,B009JVYFXO,"I have been doing Dayan Palm for less than a week and already love it.  In my 18 years of martial arts experience, I can not recall many forms this dynamic.  I can feel the power and energy in every movement.  On this DVD, Shane Lear performs both a slower, more qigong style version as well as a full-speed, martial version of the form.  The movements are explained in a manner that is easy to follow along with and learn from at your own pace.  This DVD is a necessity for those looking to make their training more well-rounded.",1351900800,2,530,4.313131313131313
