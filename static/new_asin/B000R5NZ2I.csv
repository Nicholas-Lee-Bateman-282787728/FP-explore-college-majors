8198972,5,B000R5NZ2I,"unlike these other reviewers who seem to have been nutured on graphic bloodshed,  this is an effective lowbudget one of a kind horror film it is as much of a psychological as a physical horror  a key reference point is the disturbed mother's fascination with alice in wonderland,  as the monster takes people literally down the rabbit hole into an imaginary dimension and sucks their life force dry.  the ending is truly disturbing. we need more of these brilliant indies and less of these sick torture porn and living dead flicks that inundate the horror field.",1348876800,,562,4.822916666666667
8198973,4,B000R5NZ2I,"This film reminded me of one of the better, older episodes of the X-Files where the mystery at the center of the story is ambiguous for much of the film. Is the baby crying in the field, or is it coyotes? Did an evil force steal the baby or is the mom hallucinating from the pills she takes? I found the whole thing to be pretty engaging.",1221782400,,338,4.059701492537314
8198974,5,B000R5NZ2I,"The Empty Acre is an innovative 5 star film, different from any I've seen.  Actors are low key, giving a sense of realism.  Great for Halloween!",1193097600,,144,4.5
8198975,2,B000R5NZ2I,"I know they were trying to make an atmospheric ""horror"" movie that didn't include the usual blood, guts and gore to scare up thrills, and I'm all for that, but I really couldn't find many redeeming qualities in this stinker.  Maybe they should have thrown in a fair amount of gore to get my attention.

This movie should have been interesting, it was plugged by Fangoria as being a slow burning pot-boiler or something like that - but I just couldn't stay awake!  I love slow movies - give me Ghost Story, The Dark, or Below anyday - but slow to the point of needing to be shaken awake isn't my idea of good.

The plot seemed like alot to work with - a small family in the midwest farms a plot of land that has a big ""empty acre"" in the middle of the field.  Nothing grows there. Farm animals disappear. People disappear. The couple's baby disappears.  Wife meets mysterious stranger.  You following me?

Let's just say I was not in the least bit frightened at any point in this film. Matter of fact I was so bored I began to read a magazine.
The lead female character wasn't a bad actress, but she can't work miracles with this material.  To me it seemed more like a Lifetime Movie of the (mid)Week than anything else. But if you'd like to sleep soundly for about an hour and a half, feel free.

Try harder next time, guys - please.",1191542400,,1333,4.317269076305221

There is a patch of land on there farm that nothing grows on and Jacob's cattle die on, hence ""The Empty Acre"".  One night there son Michael starts crying upstairs when Jacob goes to check on him he finds his crib empty.  Beth and Jacob become more and more hostile and depressing as they try to find answers all the while more and more people start to go missing as it seems they are abducted from blackness that rises from this piece of land that nothing grows on.

I wanted to like this film and have liked others Fangoria has recommended however this one just didn't do it for me.  For the first hour the camera goes back and forth back and forth, we see the acre, and darkness, then the acre and a plant will die on it, then the darkness creeps in, then some more of the acre over and over, just became repetitive with really nothing happening.  Fangoria said the movie is atmospheric and eerie, empty fields, the dark, and woods in general are eerie and creepy if you were to put a surveillance camera on them for a night.

The cover also says "" A Masterwork of suspense that brings back the concept of sinister"" - Film threat.  I really can't remember being on edge  at all.  A few nights ago I watched Vacancy and was completely shocked at how good it was, the beginning of that movie while there driving in there car your just waiting for something bad to happen.  I don't know exactly what there doing with the camera to make me feel that way but I felt it and here I didn't.

I'll add that I am a big fan of what you don't see can be scarier and I'm all for leaving things up to the imagination.  I don't need blood and guts  or a big digitized ghost and you don't get that here, however you don't get much of a pay off.

Some positives:  The writer/director Rea is trying to do something different here as opposed to what horror is out there now, he has you all set up in an eerie place in the woods it just doesn't pay off.  He mentions in an article he ""wanted to create a story that dealt with being trapped in a situation you can't get out of"".  I believe there is a primal fear that many people have of never getting out of an unhappy position, whether it be a job, or in Beth's case, her marriage.""  On this side of things he paints a marriage that is awkward to watch and is filled with despair and paints a good portrait of depression.  Also the neighbors that take pride in the gossip of others pain, being two faced, and toxic that like the empty acre suck the life out of people.  That is scary and gets to you because we all know people like this, and that is real.  However I just couldn't relate or buy into this acre that can't grow grass that has somewhat corny blackish stuff come out of it.

The ""Empty Acre"" could be a metaphor for how hard life can be at times and how it could suck the life out of you, your hopes and dreams and then spit you out and you don't know where the years went.  It probably is trying to say something but to me personally as a film it just didn't get to me, and wasn't that enjoyable.
This had potential and I believe could have been real scary, it just didn't happen.  Maybe next time.

** I would recommend renting this before buying.**
