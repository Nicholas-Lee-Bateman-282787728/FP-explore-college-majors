8448300,4,B004YGLPVE,"I was able to see this original version, along with the more recent remake, which are really two very different films. While the film noirish story lines were more or less retained, the original film keeps its power, partially in the sense of how one person can upset one family's domestic tranquillity, and in a greater sense, how a curse seems to settle in to punish good-hearted, decent people, through no real fault of their own. The actress who portrays the ""homewrecker"" was publicly ostracized, as so many in post-war Korea wanted to blame her for what happened to the family of her employer. There is even an added scene where the actor portraying the husband gives sort of a public service announcement, warning the audience that the best of families were susceptible to manipulation and seduction. What is strikingly different about this film and the remake is the claustrophobic feel of the home, which must have seemed luxurious to South Koreans in the early 1960s, and the spacious, luxurious accommodations in the remake. The remake also emphasizes class and power relationships more than the original, where the family is middle-class. While perhaps more theatrical and melodramatic, I think this film still holds up well, and still has a strong message for those who think that a nanny, or other domestics, can really fill the void in any household's relationship dynamics. It is important that boundaries are maintained, and that employers do not treat servants as surrogate lovers, confidantes, parents, or siblings. There is work that can be done by others, but they cannot be hired for love and emotional fulfillment, without disastrous consequences.",1529280000,,1670,5.098540145985401

8448304,4,B004YGLPVE,"The premise of this movie is really good and it really is suspenseful - keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how it is going to turn out. The music score is way over the top, though - you will probably never hear a more ""dramatic"" score in your life and actually detracts from the movie because it makes it sound like a parody.  It's a serious movie, though - no joke.  That said, the characters and their behavior is pretty bizarre and I found it interesting that a movie like this would have been made back in 1960.

The movie is about a family man who conducts a music class for the female workers at a nearby factory - I guess that's supposed to be their diversion or entertainment when not working.  He winds up hiring a young woman to be the maid for the family and as you might guess, gets seduced into an affair with her.  It then becomes a psychological thriller as the woman blackmails the man and takes control of the entire family once the wife finds out. The whole thing just makes you squirm, partly in suspense and partly because of the disgusting behavior that takes place.",1419897600,2,1097,4.331707317073171

I would put it up there with Psycho.

Crazy maid + rat poison + children = Exciting movie.",1396656000,2,161,4.161290322580645
8448306,5,B004YGLPVE,"Been waiting a very long time for this. HOUSEMAID is ""the"" classic Korean film. Its the most famous film in Korean movie history. For a long time, chunks of the film were lost and no good print existed. Apparently the World Cinema Foundation assisted the Korean Film Archives in painstakingly remastering this film. It took a lot of time, and cost a ton of money, but this DVD is the end result. This is such an amazing film, that it recently was remade in 2010, and even the remake (Amazon carries it) was screened at Cannes in 2010. If you want to see a true classic of cinema, check out this film. This DVD is absolutely excellent quality. And yes, it will play in the USA.",1304121600,12,676,4.373015873015873
