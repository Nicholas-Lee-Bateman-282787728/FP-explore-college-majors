6243328,5,B00HY70U70,"This is one of the most engaging and interesting stories I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Aniplex unfortunately slapped a MASSIVE price tag on it which is nothing new from them, however the show itself is outstanding and worth your time.",1395964800,2,245,4.72093023255814
6243329,1,B00HY70U70,"It's a good anime from what I got to see of it on Neon Alley... However paying 84.98 for a dvd set and it only being half is crazy... Honestly I don't see nor do I understand why everything from Aniplex is so over priced.... I could understand if this was 30$ or 40$ at most... But expecting someone to pay over 80$ for only half of the anime... -__- Not going to happen, I was going to buy this if it wasn't pried too high...>.> And it's sad considering this isn't even a blu ray dvd combo pack... ._. So yeah low rating do to ANIPLEX and THEIR INSANELY HIGH PRICES.",1395360000,19,567,4.071428571428571
6243330,1,B00HY70U70,"That is, making it impossible, impractical, or outright stupid to even own the show regardless of how much you like it or the overall quality.

To put it into perspective:
-You get 12 episodes
-This is on DVD, NOT Blu-Ray
-And....a few postcards.

And you are realistically expected to pay $75 MSRP ($60 through specialty retailers) for that (keep in mind, this set is only HALF of the entire show).  Just out of pure curiosity, I decided to look up an offering from Funimation - another shonen series that's around Magi's ballpark in terms of demographic and quality:  Fairy Tail.  And they offer in the first set...:
-24 episodes
-Blu-ray and DVD combo pack
-MSRP is $54 (around $40 through specialty stores)

I gotta ask:  Just what the hell is so special about Magi, or any shows licensed by Aniplex that not only deserve the premium price, without anything actually WORTH the premium?",1393632000,50,889,4.771241830065359
6243331,4,B00HY70U70,"Alibaba is a poor lad who works for various merchants to earn his living. But he dreams of bigger things - such as conquering one of the mysterious towers called ""Dungeons' and becoming fabulously wealthy. But it isn't until he meets a strange boy named Aladdin that he starts working to make his dream a reality.

Magi is obviously influenced by stories from The Arabian Nights (and Sinbad later on), but it isn't a retelling. It seems like a colorful children's adventure story, but it quickly dives into themes such as slavery, oppression, discrimination, betrayal, and politics. The characters are rather interesting as well - Alibaba seems like a complete wuss, but proves to be both braver and more complex than initially portrayed. Aladdin seems like naive kid, but he manages to develop and grow over the course of the series (a little anyway). Morgiana starts out a downtrodden slave, but regains enough self worth to become an awesomely strong character. I don't normally like female characters in anime, but I found myself quite fond of Morgiana.

This set contains the first 12 episodes of Magi: The Labyrinth (out of 25, and then there is the second series Magi: The Kingdom of Magic which is currently airing, but will probably be around the same length). Set also includes a deluxe booklet and five collectable foil stamped postcards. Japanese & English audio are both available.

Buying tip: This set is much cheaper if you buy it from rightstuff (at this time it is $59.98 vs Amazon's $84.98).",1392163200,12,1510,4.890625
8637265,5,B00HY70U70,"Saw this series on Netflix(which is a sequel to ""Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic"")  Both are truly epic  as an anime series even if you aren't into fantasy.  (I'm more of a scifi, action, drama anime goer)  The English dubbed version of this Anime isn't bad ether (which I'm usually 50/50 on).  The fact is- when you watch this series - you feel what each character goes through.  Each character has their own goals, aspirations, special abilities.  Even if you aren't an anime goer- you will fall in love with this series if you love great storytelling.  I did.",1528416000,,559,4.575757575757576
8637266,5,B00HY70U70,"I love the anime Magi and I really hope they continue it once the manga wraps up. The characters and story were just amazing I think, and I really enjoyed the world they made in this anime. Its got an old middle eastern vibe and is based on an old Arabian book, the same one Disney got its inspiration for Aladdin from. Anyways do yourself a favor and pick up this series wether it be in a hard copy version or even watch it on Netflix/Hulu it really is awesome and worth the time.",1520899200,,481,4.127659574468085
8637267,5,B00HY70U70,Expensive yes but this is quite possibly my favorite anime the characters are awesome and I love the world they made from the old Arabian tales One Thousand and One Nights. The second season is a lot better in terms of action but I still love the first season.,1520899200,,260,4.326530612244898

Look it up on the internet and find the first season for $24.99  the sellers are obviously ripping you off, $70 for HALF of the first season either you're desperate or just stupid, still a great series though should be top 10 for magical anime great story ",1456790400,,293,4.509433962264151
8637270,5,B00HY70U70,"I admit for both my creative writing hobby and for other reasons I prefer to avoid elaborating on, the anime series ; Magi;The Kingdom of Magic caught my attention because it touches on themes relating to the unifying power of magic and doing good with the gift of magical powers. I also like how Magi The Kingdom of Magic touches on the spiritual battle between good and evil and characters who journey to other worlds.  For instance, there is a scene where the characters travel together on a special ship that takes them to where they need to go. One of the characters eventually follows them after he leads  them to  at first believe that he is not coming along. However, the characters group of friends playfully chastise him for his innocent plot when they are reunited.  There are episodes of Magi;The Kingdom of Magic on Netflix for those who are still unsure.  Additional anime series for helping a person decide if they would potentially enjoy Magi  The Kingdom of Magic anime tv series is to also take a look at the following anime tv shows available on Hulu; Rental Magica, Wizard Barristers, and Magical Warfare.",1450483200,,1125,4.714285714285714
