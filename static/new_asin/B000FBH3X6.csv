8120154,3,B000FBH3X6,I love this show. The characters that Tracey plays are very convincing and funny. My personal favorite is Shanesha who works at the airport.,1417824000,,140,4.875
8120155,5,B000FBH3X6,Tracy Ullman is one of the funniest ladies on the planet. She amazes me with her scope and her change of wardrobe! I only regret that I don't see her in more movies and tv shows.,1348790400,,178,3.9722222222222223

I don't know where Tracy is hiding these days, but she is sorely missed by me.  (Maybe she's just taking it easy enjoying her status as one of Britian's Wealthest Comedians, to which I feel I've done my part to advance her status :)
This cd set is one of my all time favorites.  Her work is timeless,truly brilliant.  I never tire of watching them.
A few of my favorite sketches have become part of my 'dating litmus test'.
If I bring out my, Tracy Takes On dvd's, and my date isn't laughing, he's outa here! (or at least serious cause for concern  :)",1285027200,,571,4.308411214953271

I've been looking for Tracey Ullman's 'Tracey takes on' for YEARS and I finally found it at Amazon - where else??
It is even funnier that I remember, Tracey's characters are hillarious. Takes on is a definate classic.",1232236800,,830,10.871428571428572
