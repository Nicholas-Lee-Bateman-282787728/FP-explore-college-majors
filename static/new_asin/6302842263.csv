521823,3,6302842263,"Hollywood, now Bollywood and rest of the world cinematic trends as well, has always thrived on, heck, lived for decent if forlorn romantic movies to set the hearts of the female patrons a-flitter (and get the guys or these days whoever the escort may be to take the next seat). Back in the day, back in the post-Code 1950 (well before subject matter, nudity, profanity and whatever else a production company could think of to titillate trumped the restrictions of the increasingly unenforceable Code) most of the romances were straightforward, were look a-like boy meets look a-like-girl vehicles (meaning same race). Seldom did Hollywood venture in interracial relationships (at a time when in the United States it was illegal for blacks and whites to intermarry, for example) and so the subject matter here struck me as a viewer in 2016 of the 1955 tear-jerker (good tear-jerker but tear-jerker nevertheless) Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing seemed as rather going against the stream.

Of course the main character Mark Elliot, played by William Holden last seen in this space face down in faded film start Norma Desmonds swimming pool in the Oscar-winning Sunset Boulevard, a classic All-American guy, good-looking guy with physique to match, a writer, a newspaper writer living in Hong Kong waiting for the other shoe to drop in the coming to a head Chinese Civil War is looking for love in all the wrong places. But he can be excused for his errors since he was tied down by an extremely unhappy marriage (to an unseen off-screen wife) and because he was attracted to the Eurasian beauty Han Suyin, a stern and solid doctor out to help her people, her Chinese people. Of course, maybe reflecting the tenor of the times, as well that Eurasian beauty Suyin was played by the American actress from Oklahoma Jennifer Jones (last seen in this space playing a seemingly goofy Brit in Beat The Devil) and not a real Eurasian beauty. (By the way Jones seems to have been an all-purpose 1950s ethnic playing Latina, Native American and that Brit role as well).

In the nature of such films Mark and Suyin, or rather Suyin played hard to get, or rather has no time for romance since the death of her Nationalist-side husband in the civil war. She is all about work, all about not getting involved with a married man (at least he was honest with her at the beginning about his marital status), above all very concerned about being a proper Chinese high society denizen above reproach and above getting tangled up with a gringo. But he wears her defenses down and they begin thinking about marriage to make things right (everybody except twelve year old boys like me when I was twelve back when this film was first released knew they were hitting the satin sheets, having sex, making love not shown on the screen in those days so leaving us clueless about those chaste love scenes and then fade as usual). Making her an honest woman in society, Chinese society as well as colonial, where she faced some serious scorn and trauma for hanging with Mark. Including losing her position in the British Crown Colony hospital. Then the Korean War came along to save them once Marks wife would not divorce him. Came along and solved everything when he was killed while reporting from that benighted place, leaving Suyin with nothing but beautiful memories of her beautiful man. Love may be many-splendored but sometimes its a tough dollar too. Like I said a tear-jerker, a good tear-jerker, but tear-jerker nevertheless.",1466812800,,3503,4.826955074875208

Dr. Han is female and has a love affair with Mark Elliot, an American war correspondent in Hong Kong. The movie came out in 1955, during an period of romantic movies, and there could not be a more romantic story than this one. The couple has to deal with racism and cultural differences from both ends. Maybe all love ends in tragedy, and this love ends with Mark being sent to Korea. I remember when the theme song was popular. Jennifer Jones was among the more beautiful actresses of her era.",1444694400,,636,4.539130434782609

521859,4,6302842263,"A superb film about inter-racial identity and trans-national love.  Holden and Jones light up the screen.  Certainly, a Eurasian actress would have been more appropriate in the role of the female lead, but Ms. Jones is convincing and the script evinces a sophisticated appreciation of her character's predicament.  The film's subplot about the conflict between love and duty that fuels passions and breaks hearts in the midst of war gives the story a memorable tragic import.  The film also has a political dimension that explores the patriotic roots of the Communist Revolution in China.  In sum, the film is rich with psychological and historical observation.  It belongs on everyone's bucket list.",1443744000,,700,5.261261261261262

Having grown up since then, I was surprised by the superstitions of the Eurasian Dr. played by Jennifer Jones. The acting was excellent and cinematography excellent. I was again surprised by how cigarette smoking was glamorized. The acting was exceptional and the love story was wonderful and poignant the same time. A beautiful, clean love story and well worth watching. My 16 yr. old granddaughter enjoyed it also, with those two glaring exceptions.",1441584000,,539,4.923076923076923

521884,5,6302842263,"I purchased this movie (at an exorbitant price I might add) after buying an Oppo 103D bluray player.  The movie received excellent reviews regarding the bluray transfer and I can certainly see why .  I last saw this movie on DVD and never watched it again such was the poor quality of it.  The Twilight Time BD transfer is spectacular and the color fidelity is right on the money.  Viewing this on the Oppo 103D was worth the money spent but I would probably never spend that kind of money on a movie again.  Considering this is a 1955 movie the transfer is even more impressive. The  opening flyover scene of Repulse Bay is astounding, but even more spectacular is the whole low-profile seemless sequence of the chapter.  The scene of the ambulance driving into the hospital is, technically, jaw-dropping.  I won't spoil this to tell you how it was filmed but once you know it's even more breathtaking.  The audio and video are reference quality and this easily rates 5-stars.  Every scene has been lovingly restored and we are all the beneficiaries of  the sheer beauty of this. Further, considering the trite that passes for romance, or love story these days, makes this movie all the more precious and everlasting.  On second thought maybe I would spend this kind of money again - but the bar this transfer set is rather high - so the next BD transfer better be able to match its quality.",1433116800,3,1392,4.6138211382113825

A great companion/comparison film would be The World of Suzie Wong where finally the Asian girl was played by an Asian girl appearing opposite the same big male Hollywood star, William Holden.

William Holden and Jennifer Jones play the couple in this bittersweet tragedy of an American and Eurasian beset by racial hurtles during the period for half Chinese/European romances. Suyin, a doctor, is fired from the British hospital where she woprks, and Mark is sent to Korea when conflict breaks out. Beautifully filmed and acted, though the drama was not as powerful as Holdens movie with Nancy Kwan in The World of Susie Wong, still the story was sweet, if not tragic. The author is also a fascinating story. Under the pseudonym of Han Suyin, Rosalie Matilda Kuanghu Chou, a China-born Eurasian, she was a doctor, and wrote numerous books on the East and South East Asia. Love Is A Many Splendored Thing is actually based on her romance with Ian Morrison, an Australian war correspondent who was killed in Korean.",1404345600,5,906,4.814102564102564

522091,2,6302842263,"I've had this film on DVD for many years and back then I thought that the picture quality was tolerable.  Now that I have this limited edition Blu-Ray release from Twilight Time, I find this somewhat remastered version to be not so impressive.

Some frames look very muddy for about a second before it suddenly begins to look sharper, and then sometimes too, it will look blurry just before it changes to another scene. Which goes to say, that every frame gets the remastered treatment to a degree, but some frames are left un-mastered here and there. Like they got lazy sometimes. It is only more noticeable now on Blu-Ray then the previous DVD version.

I'm wondering if the remastered frames were mostly done by women because the scenes with William Holden seem to look like a better remastering effort was applied more than that of Jennifer Jones.

Well, anyway, about the film itself. I guess the only reason why I liked this movie in the first place is because I like William Holden's later film ""The World of Suzie Wong"" and though it was only made five years later, my DVD of that film looks better than the Blu-Ray of ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing.""

What's more, Nancy Kwan, and the other asian girls in the film of Suzie Wong were all alot prettier than Jennifer Jones. Probably because both films were done in Hong Kong, I appreciated the more asian presence of the leading girls in Suzie Wong.

Since this Blu-Ray is of a limited edition (only 3000 copies made), I may just resell this Blu-Ray film and hope to see ""The World of Suzie Wong"" come out on Blu-Ray someday.

Both films have a lot of prejudices and I find that very uncomfortable to sit through but for this film's already many disappointments, I don't think I'll bother to watch this one again.",1389052800,2,1773,4.574132492113565

There is no comparison between the two films.  To me, Splendored Thing is a rather flat, slow moving film that lacks real chemistry between it's stars and there just simply isn't enough story.  The fact that Jennifer Jones has never been one of my favorite actresses may be some of the reason for my lukewarm opinion.  She does less contorting and twisting of her face in this but still has that little lisp thing that I find annoying. I just never believed either of their performances and I know Bill Holden is capable of a much better performance than this.

There are sections of her book that are spellbindingly beautiful and very touching. If I have any reservations, it might be when she shifts into full poetic levels of descriptive passages. She often stays up in the heady layers of stratosphere too long. However, an area where this certainly wasn't the case is when she applies a stunning variety of angles of observation when she and Mark are admiring the rising or setting moon in Hong Kong or in China. It may be time for Suyin's works to be rediscovered as she had her finger on the problems and the changing face of Asia and western reactions long before it became fashionable in the West. And, perhaps, its time for Hollywood or Broadway to revisit LIMST with an eye to reimagining a new, fresher production with a real Chinese actress playing the part of Suyin. It would certainly warrant serious consideration, especially since Suyin's observations would still seem pertinent to todays situation of West meeting and understanding East.",1354924800,3,1136,4.952879581151833

522277,5,6302842263,"This movie has been panned as melodramatic and not very deep when it comes to talk about Communist China.  There are also complaints about Jennifer Jones not being good in the part.  It's this last criticism that I find most strange.  In the 50's no less, she portrays a beautiful and complex woman with an independent life she never even hints at giving up for love.  It's perfect.  The love story is romantic but not unrealistic--what I mean by that is the people had just fallen in love and people really do act like that during the first meeing of two souls.  The music is wonderful, the architecture and costumes beautiful.  It's just magic and well worth having.  Ok, women are going to like it better than men.  I also think the comments on communism have actually grown more relevant over time.  They are not silly.  I don't think the movie is dated, it portrays a love story with complexity yet maintains a simple enough story to make it easy to just concentrate on love of life.",1239926400,4,988,4.52542372881356
522278,3,6302842263,"That line never fails to make me laugh when I hear it within the context of an intentionally dramatic scene in this atmospheric 1955 romantic sudser that was a big hit in its day thanks to the familiar Sammy Fain theme song. At the same time, the somewhat patronizing Orientalism of that line represents much of the arm's-length approach the film has in reflecting the U.S. attitude toward China in the 1950's. Viewed by today's standards, the result feels emotionally simplistic like a more thoughtful Harlequin romance novel, even though the production values are first-rate. However, the bigger problem with the film is the unfortunate lack of chemistry between the two leads, Jennifer Jones and William Holden. Their characters' romance never quite resonates, and the pacing is not helped by Henry King's lugubrious direction.

Set against the backdrop of the 1949 Communist Revolution, Han Suyin, a Eurasian doctor in Hong Kong falls for Mark Elliott, a married war correspondent. The film focuses on their somewhat illicit love story at a time when a relationship between a half-Chinese, half-European woman and an American was considered as forbidden as the inevitable adultery. The racism and culture clashes between East and West take up much of the storyline with the lovers surrounded by English colonialists thriving on the class distinctions left over from the Victorian era, and by her equally traditional Chinese relatives who shun the imprint being left by the Europeans. The film benefits immensely from the use of actual Hong Kong locations with the cinematography by Leon Shamroy and Charles G. Clark providing a textbook example of how to create the right atmosphere given the exotic locations.

Because of her Svengali-like relationship and eventual marriage to mega-producer David O. Selznick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B0002V7TZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>), Jones had an interesting array of roles during her career. She can be appealing in the right role (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Portrait-of-Jennie/dp/B0002KPHYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Portrait of Jennie</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beat-the-Devil/dp/B00005YUNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beat the Devil</a>), but she never quite brings this conflicted character to life. Burdened with trying to look and act Chinese, she comes across as stiff and often actressy, although she improves as the story moves along. As Mark, Holden is wasted in a relatively colorless role given that he was at his career peak at the time, and despite his expressions of enduring love, he can't seem to create the desperately needed sparks with Jones like he did with Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly. Even with all its flaws, the movie is still worthwhile to see for its lush production and for the surprisingly robust set of extras on the 2003 DVD with a commentary track provided by film historian Sylvia Stoddard, UCLA film scholar John Burlingame, and cinematographer Michael Lonzo. Stoddard and Burlingame fill in a lot of the interesting details on the life of the real Han Suyin, while Lonzo's comments are limited to the technical details of the CinemaScope production.",1238371200,17,3314,5.816872427983539

522308,5,6302842263,"This 1955 movie is about the struggle between honor, propriety, cross cultural relationships, and love. The story develops with two people who fall in love. Jennifer Jones plays the part of an Eurasian doctor, a widow, a woman who has resigned herself to the care of others and promises never to allow her heart to open up to another relationship.

William Holden plays newsman Mark Elliott, a dashing correspondent, a gentle and virile man who has the patience and the subtleness to spark the necessary fire for her to allow herself to find new meaning to her life. But, he is a married man.

As she says... ""look at the faces of unhappy people who don't have the love we share!"" There is much going on around this lovely couple, communism is surfacing all over China, the Korean War calls William Holden away, she travels back to China to visit her family and bravely confronts her relative with the news that she wants to marry out of her own culture, a foreigner, an American. He travels to ask his wife for a divorce, which she at first grants, only to later deny him his freedom.

Throughout the movie we are at the edge of our seat... what will happen next? The dialogue between these two human beings is superb, capturing the struggle and ending in poetic promises of honor and ardent love.

The costumes are simply magnificent as she wears silk Chinese suits, and he... simply continues to capture the hearts of audiences. My favorite part is the symbolism shared by this movie, with butterflies providing the essence of the transformation the characters undergo as they interface and fall in love with one another. And the theme music of this movie is unforgettable... you will find yourself humming away for days after you watch and enjoy... Love is a many splendorous thing!

This DVD offers additional features, and the biography of William Holden alone is enough for us to want to own this classic in our collection. It provides a rare and intimate view of the life of one of Hollywood's greatest actors, allowing us to see his wife and children.

I love watching people fall in love... It must have something to do with the excellent chemistry between the main characters...

Mark Elliott, a charming sensitive American war correspondent, arrives in Hong Kong at the dawn of the Korean war... He finds in Han Suyin an awesome beauty of true grace...

Han Suyin, a lovely Eurasian doctor is captivated by Mark's tenderness and insight...

It was instant attraction when they first met... The two commence a passionate affair, leading them to fall deeply in love...

Their love is so strong, so wonderfully expressed that highlights Elliot's married status, and the difficulties of the troubled time of the Korean War, communism and race relations...

Holden is an inspired choice for the role... Not only does he have an imposing screen presence, but he brings the perfect mix of enlightenment, compassion and emotion to the part...

Opposite him Oscar Winner Jennifer Jones, perfect in her oriental look, radiantly beautiful in that traditional and modern Asian-inspired Cheongsam... Jones floods her role with personal emotion giving her character a charismatic life of its own... She delivers a heartfelt performance turning her character into a woman who undergoes a spiritual and emotional awakening...

Her scene in that verdant hill where she takes refuge is exquisitely touching specially when we heard Mark's voice whispering: ""We have not missed you and I... that many-splendored thing.""

Henry King - who has established himself as a masterful director of romances - spreads the theme tune (by Alfred Newman) in the air above the cosmopolitan harbor... His film is colorful, elegant, with excellent cinematography and set design...

522355,5,6302842263,"This film is one of my favourite movie by my equally favourite actor, the late William Holden. (Holden acted in many a quality film, including The 7th Dawn, 1963, filmed in Malaysia about the daring jungle fighters of Chin Peng...!)

Incidentally, Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing, is based on the popular novel called A MANY-SPLENDOURED THING by Miss Han Suyin, published  in 1952. Suyin is a prolific writer of Chinese stories, as she was borned in China and a doctor by profession. She wrote more than a dozen books on China. I hope she will be nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Her fascinating accounts of China are as fascinating and accurate as those written by the acclaimed Pearl S. Buck (1937 film - The Good Earth available on DVD).

Han Suyin's  novel to which the film is based on is centred around Hong Kong in the early 1950s, historical as well as romantic in perspective. History in that China was newly  liberated by the armies of Mao and romantic when she felled in love with Mark, an American journalist, who subsequent died of a bomb explosion while covering the outbreak of the Korean War.

William Holden as Mark enjoyed life in postwar Hong Kong and felled deeply in love with Han Suyin, who steeped  in Chinese culture, had to fly to Chung King to consult her uncles and aunts, which reluctantly consented to their getting married. However, Mark's wife in Singapore  refused to divorced him, thus making it impossible for Suyin to be his wife legally.

The beautiful and romantic scene on an isolated Hong Hill top and under an old and gnarled tree, Mark and Suyin swore to love one another ""eternally"" makes a deep rooted impression on the true meaning of love....!

I strong recommend this DVD version of the film to viewers because the entire film was made in Hong Kong in 1950s - fascinating views of life in this British colony (including the cluster of simple boatwomen with babies on their backs and earning a living rowing their crafts)  with its geopolitics looming across the border from Mainland China. And the expatriates arriving in Hong Kong to ""escape"" the trauma of the Mao's liberation armies, unknown quantity then!

The theme song and music are both touching and fantastic...so go for it before it is gone forever. Cheers and happy viewing pals!",1153699200,4,2299,4.763224181360202
522356,5,6302842263,"I saw this film for the first time when I was very young.  I went with my parents to see it when it was first premiered.  CinemaScope had recently been 'born' and the novelty of the wide screen and the stereophonic sound were still fresh.  The 'high and windy hill' and the panaroma of Hong Kong were as much a part of the film as the actors and dialogue and were a joy to see.  I expect that by today's standards,  this is a corny film, and is politically incorrect and of little value.  However, I still find it a delight.  This film has charm, which is something that can not be said about many movies or actors today and a joy to behold when watched.  Certainly, one has to be a 'romantic' to enjoy it and, I for one, am not ashamed to be labelled as such.  I remember when I first saw this film, many people in the cinema were seen to be wiping their eyes once it concluded and the house lights came up.  I suspect that many still do this when they watch it for the first time.",1152748800,,982,4.067708333333333
522357,4,6302842263,"Dr A: Okay, guys. We need a differiential diagnosis. Here are two inter-racial, middle-aged films set in Hong Kong. LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING born in 1954. And&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WORLD-OF-SUZIE-WONG/dp/B0001ZWLTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WORLD OF SUZIE WONG</a>&nbsp;born in 1959.

Dr B: Uh...did you know that the first movie was based on a partially autobiographical novel whose title was A MANY SPLENDORED THIING. I guess movie goers need things spelled out.

Dr A: Thanks for that diagnostically irrelevent interruption.

Dr C: Well. They both have the ever-reliable, All-American William Holden playing a part that in the originating novel was an English dude.

Dr B: Uh...both are color films, altho, LOVE is a Hollywood film with richer, saturated colors while SUZIE has a more natural look to it.

Dr D: Have you noticed that the women characters are opposites?

Dr C: Yeah. Han Suyin is an doctor while Suzie Wong is a prostitute.

Dr D: More than that. LOVE's central character is a Eurasian woman played by an American, Jennifer Jones. While SUZIE is about a young Chinese woman played by an Eurasian, Nancy Kwan.

Dr B: They both have a little Chinese dialog.

Dr A: That could be the source of infectious embarrassment. Maybe. The occurrences of Jennifer Jones's linguistic mutilation are pretty rare and relatively painless. And she remains one of my favorite actresses.

Dr C: Mine too.

Dr D: Mine too.

Dr B: Not mine.

Dr A: Who asked you?

Dr B: No one, but I just wanted to say that Nancy Kwan's hot, anatomically speaking, and does pretty well for a first time actress. And she speaks real Chinese.

Dr A: Such insight. But I agree. Just don't diss Jennifer again or no Jackie Chan movies for you for a week.

Dr D: I like the music of both.

Dr C: They were both written by Westerners, you know. Lyrics were added and LOVE IS A MANY SPLENDORED THING became a smash hit. SUZIE's music is the more Chinese-sounding, however.

Dr D: Speaking of Chinese sounding, LOVE sometimes sounds as if Confucius wrote the script. Don't you think Suyin's dialog sounds like Chinese aphorisms?

Dr C: I read that Chinese often employ ancient proverbs in conversation. It just sounds stilted to us. I bet English expressions sound weird to them.

Dr B: I thought Jennifer Jones made it sound refined because she made the character seem so intelligent and refined.

Dr A: Oh, admit it. You're just saying nice-nice about Jennifer in order to suck up after your faux paux.

Dr B: Maybe. A little. But the movie's worth a look-see. Haaa...did you notice? 'Look-see' was taken from Chinese language.

Dr A: That's it! No Jackie Chan for a month!",1152403200,4,2718,4.977827050997782

Set in the turbulent days of Hong Kong during the Korean War, the story concerns war correspondant Mark Elliott (William Holden) who falls in love with widowed Eurasian doctor Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) who, while coming from completely different walks of life, fall in love. Based on the real-life Han Suyin's bestselling novel of the same name, the film candidly deals with themes of prejudice and the dangerous political climate of the time.  Beautifully-filmed on location in Hong Kong.

The casting is impeccable: Jennifer Jones is luminous as Suyin (even more glorious in Technicolor) and William Holden adds a great edge to his performance.  Isobel Elsom plays Mrs Palmer-Jones, the racist wife of the head of the hospital (her scenes with Jones still ring true).

522405,4,6302842263,"The depth and power of this movie lies in the slow development of a resistant yet decisive woman who capitulates to feelings of a love that she has never known before and the determined persistence of a man who yields to her needs during the courtship and finds himself succumbing to a love he has never known before.  No matter how tragic the end, they did not miss out on the ""many-splendored thing"".  Not many find such exquisite love or are touched by tragedy so cruel.  People who think the movie is silly or unreal have probably never experienced a deep and powerful love or a true tragedy.  The movie must be judged in the context of its time but it is not hard to forgive some of the stilted scenes since the passion and the nuances of the range of emotions (including her debates within herself and his transformation into resolving his problems) shine through the whole movie.  The dialogue may seem unreal to some but very intelligent people are often poetic and philosophical in their romantic conversations and every word is to be treasured. Such phrases are always etched in the memory of a lover who has found such a rare love.  I have not read the book but am not surprised to find that it is a true story.  It is too real to be fiction, too profound to be based on imagined characters.  The rendition in this movie is breathtaking.  I watched it 3 times in one week and it gets better every time.  Yes, and the ending is a crescendo of beautiful, haunting music and lyrics that supports and soothes the audience's tears.",1111536000,9,1537,4.496402877697841

- there are beautiful shots from 1950s Hong Kong.

- there is no unnecessary violence, bad language etc.

- it makes an effort to be a nice, family-oriented love movie.

On the other hand

- Jennifer Jones as a ""Eurasian"" physician appears ridiculous, come on Hollywood, why not take a real Asian.

- The dialogues are totally unbelievable, nobody speaks that way in real life.

- The colour and lighting of the film makes the whole surrounding appear unreal.

- The emotions don't appear genuine either, neither does Holden appear to love Jones, nor does Jones appear honestly sad when Holden dies.

- The music is horrible.

- The plot is boring and predictable.

- There is no happy ending, what kind of love movie is that?

For a really good love movie featuring Holden, with a similar theme and much better acting, better go for ""The World of Suzie Wong"", which also plays in Hong Kong, sharing the strong points of this film while not suffering from the same weaknesses.",1100390400,5,1056,4.588235294117647
522407,2,6302842263,"This film looks great, and that's about where my praise ends.
""Love Is a Many Splendored Thing"" came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-coloured nonsense like this co-existed with trail-blazing artistic fair like ""Kiss Me Deadly."" As a trend toward smaller, socially conscious films like ""On the Waterfront"" and ""Marty"" established itself in the mid-50's, other directors felt the need to stick with the unchallenging, pandering melodrama that classifies so many other films from that decade, and ""Love"" is one of the latter.
This is the kind of 50's movie where the Technicolor is used to its garish utmost and the lighting is invariably high-key; even scenes taking place in a dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day.  I never want to hear the theme song again, as it's played frequently enough over the course of the film to last anyone a lifetime, and I certainly don't want to hear it sung by the shrill, ear-piercing choir that belts it out over the end titles.  Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but really anybody could have played these parts.  Jones' role is horribly written--her character is incredibly inconsistent, and it seems as if whenever her character is required to make a decision about something, the screenwriters flipped a coin to decide what that decision would be.
People will undoubtedly tell me I'm taking this film too seriously, that I'm unromantic, etc.  But I loved ""All That Heaven Allows,"" released the same year and just as cornball in its own way, except that Douglas Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, whereas Henry King (director of ""Love"") is not.
I'm usually able to enjoy bad melodrama, but in this case I was just bored.

522409,4,6302842263,"When 20th Century-Fox initially released this film to DVD the 2:55:1 transfer was not enhanced for widescreen televisions.  This new version of ""Love Is A Many Splendored-Thing"" corrects that oversight and gives us a comprehensive documentary on William Holden besides.  The film concerns itself with a real life love story between Eurasian doctor, Han Sue-Yin (Jennifer Jones) and married American reporter, Mark Elliot (William Holden).  Set in the unstable political climate of Hong Kong, and featuring some breaktaking cinematography, captured in all its Cinemascope glory, this film is a remarkably effective piece of fiction and, with its Oscar-winning title song, remains a sure fire hit.
Aside from its anamorphic enhancements, this new transfer doesn't make any quantum leaps forward in image quality.  The initial print was remarkably smooth looking, save a few instances where film grain is a bit excessive.  Edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering details are kept to a bare minimum.  Colors are very rich, vibrant and, for the most part, accurate, only occasionally giving way to orangy flesh tones.  Pixelization is a problem from time to time. The audio is the same 4.0 as the previous disc - occasionally strident, but on the whole very well spread across all of the speakers.
As already stated, this disc includes a Biography special on William Holden that is remarkably comprehensive, considering its running time plays at under an hour.  Image quality varies, according to the elements of film stock from the various movie clips used.  There's also a theatrical trailer - badly dated, and a Movietones news reel of the film's premiere.
BOTTOM LINE: NICELY DONE FROM FOX THIS TIME AROUND.  My only concern is this - as with all Fox movies previously issued to DVD, the source elements were cleaned up before their reissue.  As in the case of ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"" (last month's studio classic release) the image quality of a first run DVD was bad to awful.  I only hope that next month's release ""The Song Of Bernadette"" comes closer to ""Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing"" than ""The Ghost And Mrs. Muir"".

It is suffused with the most patronizing stereotypes and condescending dialogue, including the ""how could the poor benighted Chinese do this to themselves"" mentality that was so prevalent in the '50s.  The dialogue is badly written and even more badly delivered.  The crowning moment of absurdity, among many such moments, may be the scene in which Holden and Jones reach the climax of one of their many thoroughly unconvincing love scenes by having Holden light a cigarette, stick a cigarette in Jones' mouth, and stick the lit end of his cigarette dramatically against the end of her cigarette as the overwrought theme music rises in the background.

522411,5,6302842263,"The movie was incredible.  I knew that it was going to be a sad ending.. it would have been more difficult to tolerate a happily ever after ending for the white audiences. Expecially during the time the movie was made. Although times have changed i think there is still a very strong 'discomfort' from society with different racial romances. The chemistry between william holden and jennifer jones was extraordinary and magnificent. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what attraction and chemistry is.  I think the reason may have to do with the stars explosive relationship off-set.  Supposedly Jennifer Jones was very aware of William's playboy ways of having an affair with his leading ladies.  Jennifer wouldn't tolerate any of William's advances and that lead to them having firey relationship. Jennifer Jones would try to deter him from being attracted to her by chewing garlic cloves during the love scenes.  When William Holden tried to give her a bouqet of white roses, she threw it back at him!  My guess is that Jennifer was smart enough to know she didn't want to be involved with a playboy but was attracted to him neverthless.  why else would she be so explosive and try so hard to keep him at bay? I think that was the ingredient to such amazing chemistry onscreen. They're both incredibly attracted to each other but couldn't go any farther than that. I mean she's absolutely stunning and beautiful in the movie and william holden is gorgeous and sexy as always. How could they not be attracted?  The only thing i wasn't happy about was the china scenes. Talk about robots.  Why did they make the chinese actors so stiff? Jennifer Jones's chinese was horrendous but of course that can be overlooked. I also didn't like the way Jennifer kept on stressing over and over that she's EurAsian.  She kept saying it but the more it seemed she was European than anything else. Maybe a EurAsian who doesn't know much about China or Asians except maybe what she read about here and there.  But i understand its hard to fully portray the nuances of an ethnicity that ur not. I couldn't stand William Holden's character when he couldn't get a divorce from his wife. That didn't make much sense. Sounds a little fishy there.  It reminds me of Ms. Saigon where the lead white character profess undying love and then marries another woman his own race. While the asian girl never forgetting the love kills herself at the end.  And the man explaining to his wife ""it was just one of those thing when he was young, haha"". JERK.  I get so angry seeing all these asian prostitutes in american films.  Its a bit refreshing to see a doctor in this one.  Most asians are NOT prostitutes.. only a small handful-just like anywhere else in the world.  Its only because american soldiers surrounded themselves in that atmosphere that thats the only thing they know about asian culture. Most respectable asian women never go near or see a prostitute for all of their lives.

522452,4,6302842263,"Love involves a blend of chemistry, which was displayed when American war correspondent William Holden met Eurasian doctor Jennifer Jones in Hong Kong.  It was the kind of romantic setting for love to bloom.  The beach at Repulse Bay is shown in its idyllic splendor, as well the breathtaking mountain top view of Victoria Peak, which Tennessee Williams called his favorite world site.  Love inspires song, and the title song, also called ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing,"" won a highly deserved Oscar and has remained a world classic.
Twentieth Century Fox assigned the most prolific director in the history of the studio, the talented Henry King, to the project, and he delivered with highly favorable results, keeping the story moving at the right pace while utilizing the magnificent scenery of Hong Kong.  While the film is classifiable as a love story, an interesting aspect involves the adjustment problems encountered by Jones as a Eurasian, trying to blend into a sociological picture where Chinese and largely British elements fraternized with their own, with individuals falling into both the Oriental and European categories, such as the case here, being frequenty shunned by both groups.
While the film ends on the sad note of Holden's death while covering the Korean War, Jones' strength is displayed as she remembers the man she loved while vowing to endure.  Jones accordingly generates admiration for her survivor status as well as her capacity to love correctly.",1014508800,4,1480,5.15

I first saw the film on AMC (American Film Classics).  The on location scenes of 1950's Hong Kong, made me felt warmth all over, as I remembered again what Hong Kong was like, before the real estates tycoons invaded the landscape with towers.  The lush green pastures, the narrowed crowded city streets flanked with 3 stories buildings with huge terraces, all made me recollect how Hong Kong was in those year round hot and humid days.
Although the love story is wonderful and I did get very emotional toward the end, the best part about the film; (at least for me), was the score, and the great love song, ""Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing"".  Who can argue with the idea that ""..Love is natures way of giving a reason to be living.."" and ""..two lovers kissed and the world stood still.."".

Jones is at her best and it shows her subtle voice; it is neither weak nor nagging but this film belongs to love and to have it you need another person and at a key scene at a party we are introduced to Holden! Wow, this man was a master of presence and had such a natural flow to his acting. The intimate scenes of them on the way back from visiting one of Jones' friends are simply haunting.

Although I have to applaud the film for shining some light on the racism so blatantly and sometimes subtlely displayed towards a people in their native land.  Never ceases to blow my mind how arrogant, ignorant and downright rude Americans (whom I am one) can be.
The romance was obvious and there was little chemistry between Holden and the lovely Ms. Jones.  More character development could've helped the story.  What was it about Suyin that William Holden was so attracted to verses other women.  And vice versa.

522457,5,6302842263,"I have to admit that it is a pretty cheesy way and a cheap shot to market this film with a half naked William Holden holding a seemingly breathless Jennifer Jones.
But the movie is anything but cheesy and cheap.
Shot in breathtaking technicolor, Love Is A Many-Splendored THing opens with a spectacular aerial shot of Hong Kong in the early 1950s. We are introduced to Han Suyin, a doctor who is half chinese and half English. During a reception, she met Joe Gillis, an American reporter.
Suyin, being a widow, at first denied any attraction she feels for Joe, but eventually she gave in. But her relationship with Joe is blocked by obstcales, both social and political: Suyin's relationship with Joe threatens her position at the hospital she works, Joe's wife refuse to grant him a divorce, the communist threat on mainland China which puts Suyin's family in danger, and the Korean war brewing nearby, to which Joe may have to cover for his newspaper.
Jennifer Jones delivered one of the best performances of her career. Originally, she was supposed to don Asian makeup, when the tests turn out horrendous, Jennifer was allow to look the way she does, but she convincingly played a Eurasian on mannerism and speech alone. Her performance at the finale wrenches your heart.
As for the movie itself, it is best to watch it on DVD, because it is where you can watch it on widescreen. You get to see the movie without anybody's face being cut off, the pan and scan effect, and you can enjoy the amazing cinematography.

Henry  King did a superb job in combining all the aspects of romance, racial  unrest, political and social power, and socio-economic conditions out in  the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong during the late 1940's.  Suyin fell  in love with Mark Elliot, but she had difficulty in coming to terms of  becoming European, and at the same time, the Palmer-Jonses had tremendous  power in the colony.  Adeline Palmer-Jones as the wife of the director of  the hospital was always there to let Dr. Hom know in subtle ways that she  did not fit in.  The scene where the director orders Dr. Hom to attend to  his wife before she dares to go onto the wards well illustrated the  socio-economic problems in Hong Kong.  The British society people ruled  Hong Kong, and the poor or ailing Chinese were treated as second class  citizens, including Dr. Hom.  Another powerful scene was when the Chinese  doctor gave Dr. Hom the news that her residency would not be renewed.  Dr.  Hom replied that she could go into private practice, and her friend  informed her that to be realistic, it would not be possible because the  British people would only seek medical assistance from their own kind.  It  was interesting her girlhood friend did what she had to do in order to fit  into Hong Kong society, and as another Eurasian, she passed herself off as  English.
I recently watched this movie again for about the fourth time,  and it has been about some 45 years since I saw  it for the first time.  I  am no longer a young person, but I could still appreciate the handsome and  romantic William Holden as Mark Elliot.  He was divine.
