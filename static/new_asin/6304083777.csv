776609,4,6304083777,"Possible spoilers.  This excellent Japanese animated movie comes from director Mamoru Oshii and was the inspiration for the 2017 live action film starring Scarlett Johansson.  Here the heroine, Major Motoko Kusangi is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka, at least if you're listening to the Japanese versionand you should be.  There is an English track but the voice acting is stilted and uncomfortable.  Id rather hear it in the native language and read the translation.

In any case Major is the most advanced cyborg cop.  A human shell of advanced technology but with a human brain with some enhancements.  The brain retains but a ghost of memory.  Working for Section 9 and their chief, Aramaki (Akio Otsuka), Major and her squad are attempting to find a character known as The Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi).  She is trying to destroy the corporation which is responsible for integrating cyborg bodies with human brains.  This includes Major and others.  As time passes, Major begins to question her own past and whether the story of how she was saved from death is accurate.

This DVD obviously limits the quality of the picture but it does seem to do well upgraded with new TV technology.  The Japanese animation is mostly hand-drawn cels with some computer enhancements.  Like much of the anime, it is dramatically paler than what you might see from Pixar and others.  The film is R rated primarily for female nudity and language.  Both Major and The Puppet Master are well-endowed and anatomically correct, something Scar-Jo didn't go for.  This is a terrific motion picture by any standard and is perhaps deserving of a visual upgrade on my part.  A great introduction into Japanese Anime.",1514764800,2,1686,4.960714285714285

776614,3,6304083777,"Purchased the 25th Anniversary with my Fire TV from Amazon Video. I was excited when I saw it was subtitled in English and the Japanese cast was credited. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be the dubbed version only. Sure, I can turn on the English subtitles, but not the Japanese audio. I am grateful that Amazon Customer Service allowed me to return it. So disappointed.

776668,2,6304083777,"I should have learned by now but I keep forgetting that ""deep"" stories in geek culture are still pretty superficial compared to genuinely deep thinking.

Perhaps when it came out these ideas hadn't been beaten to death but I had trouble staying engaged. Perhaps the hardest part was it's clear the talent lies in the visuals and perhaps the concept but they didn't hire writers who could translate that into engaging dialogue.

It is beautiful, though. The best part was the interlude where they just showed scenes of the city with a haunting song playing.",1511395200,,556,4.842105263157895

There are some differences but also a lot of similarities. I really enjoyed seeing the film again. I also have the 2.0 version and watched it again too.

776727,5,6304083777,"Otaku John here to review what is in my opinion the first anime film to get the entire genre taken as a true classic art form by the rest of society.  Ghost In The Shell, (hereafter abbreviated as GITS), is a definitive sci-fi / action / drama that is amazing and stands the test of time.  Animation is breathtaking, and it blends dystopian cyberpunk (think blade-runner) with philosophical intellectual self-awareness (think Carl Jung).  The writer,  Masamune Shirow, is a master, as is the director, Mamoru Oshii.  Like Akira, Cowboy Bebop, and Blade Runner, this film pioneered a genre that has made Anime into what it is today.  You can't call yourself a true anime fan if you don't own a copy of this fine film.  If you've only seen that awful live-action movie they butchered recently, give this a try. It'll make you a GITS fan for life.  But be forewarned, once you start watching GITS, you're going to want to watch them all, it's that good of a series.  And if you like to read, check out the Manga too.  Excellent all-around.",1503619200,,1036,4.612021857923497

I really liked the story, the characters (if not the English-speaking voice actors), and the animation. It starts to bog down at around 30 minutes, when two characters woodenly recite some Philosophy 101 blather for a few minutes. After that, every ten minutes or so the movie grinds to a screeching halt for more what does it mean to be alive blah blah blah. Its the sort of tedious philosophical crap that seems deep when you're 16; after you take a couple of philosophy courses, or read a few books, or get some life experience not so much. Aside from that, and the English voice actors in the dubbed version being really just terrible (dont judge me for watching the dubbed version), I thought it was okay, but I expected it to be a lot better.",1502755200,,843,4.445161290322581

776784,4,6304083777,"Interesting ideas, good animation, a bit on the nose. There are points where the characters just turn to face to camera and explain a philosiphical point, which makes it feel like some sort of educational breaking-the-fourth-wall video. Just framing it so they're depicted as still in conversation or really anything than looking straight at the viewer would have been less jarring to me. I'm not a giant fan of the voice acting either sometimes.
It's still a great movie though (and about a million times better than the live action version).",1499212800,,543,4.978021978021978
776785,4,6304083777,"This is a review of the DVD.  Pros: Japanese and English both available in DTS-ES or DTS-EX. The color looks better than the 25th Anniversary Blu-ray. Some of the dub actually made more sense than the subtitles during some of the more philosophical moments. Cons: subtitles are not quite as good as they should be. The English dub is okay but is quite different from the subtitles which are the same in both languages, there is also a difference in tone. Example is at the start Motoko says ""I'm on my period"" in Japanese in English she says ""Must be a loose wire"" a few other spots through out the film. The DVD also has special features on a separate disc, none are available on the 25th Anniversary Blu-ray.",1499040000,10,710,4.503875968992248

All in all i wish I'd bought the original normal version or the BluRay (i didn't have a bluray player when I ordered it.

776928,5,6304083777,"After seeing the recent live action remake of Ghost in the Shell and then reviewing various video essays on youtube, I decided to purchase the original anime to see it. The story in the original makes more sense in that the entire film seems to fit together in a cohesive narrative.

The live action remake has more action in it than the somewhat contemplative feel of the anime which spends time on visuals of the city to give you an idea of the city. So this is very much a Japanese film and not a Hollywood action flick.

The animation is good though different from the animation of current Hollywood animated films. The animation seems a bit flat and a bit subdued and a bit less detailed than current animation and the movement is not always fluid. At the same time there seems to be more life feel to the film, more realistic than the live action remake because though the animation is not detailed, the narrative and story is.

This DVD came with several different audio allowing to choose English dubbing or the original Japanese with English subtitles. I found it interesting to check the English subtitles of the Japanese against the dubbed English. The English subtitles seem to be more appropriate so I wonder about the translation used for the English dubbing.",1494633600,3,1273,4.674107142857143

They both have the same dark ""feel"" and music but not all of the story is identical. In many ways the feel is like ""Blade Runner"" although they have different plots. The English subtitles and English dialog (dubbed) do not always match. This was not a problem for me because the English dialog was very clear. If I watch this movie again I will just turn the captions off. I wear hearing aids and frequently used captions but I did not need them for this version of the movie. My guess is that the spoken dialog and the captions were independently translated from the original Japanese. The translations mean the same but the phrases are not identical.

777041,4,6304083777,"I recently saw the live-action film, so I decided to watch the original again for comparison. This was the second time that I had watched it, with the first time being 10 or more years ago. In that 10 year period, I had also seen both seasons of the series (Standalone Complex, Gigs 1&2,) which I LOVED. Excellent anime, with a truly intelligent storyline and execution. However, when I went back to the original movie, I was slightly underwhelmed. I found it to be less exciting and thought provoking than the follow-up series. In fact, it seemed more like a pilot episode for the series, rather than a true movie. That was not helped by the fact that most of the English-speaking voice actors in the film reprised their roles in the series, voicing the same characters. The biggest exception being the woman who voiced the Major. In my opinion, the woman who voiced her in the series (who played Peggy Bundy in the series ""Married With Children"") was WAY better than the woman who voiced her in the movie. In the movie, she sounds much younger, and less mature/confident. That being said, it is still a very good movie, and was the inspiration for many good stories/series in the years following its release. I just wish the story had been a little more involved, and less vague in certain areas. I think the new live-action version did a great job with that, by adding an altered storyline that explored the characters a bit more. And Scarlett Johansson did a great job as the Major, though her character is a little less ""tough"" than the one portrayed in the series. Still, I would recommend the original movie to anyone who is a fan of ""intelligent"" anime, especially the classics.",1492300800,6,1686,4.642140468227424

777043,2,6304083777,"Manga and Anime have become chic ...the trendy, hipster genre of the film world. No matter how bad it is, there will be people regaling about these movies' incredible animation and social/human/tech undertones. But with these once-upon-a-time novel movies, you find whimsical, childish human interactions conflicted against stiff, overly-mature (yet barely elaborated on) subtexts. I loved and was bewildered by the beautiful AKIRA as a teenager, but as an adult, I find the themes rather bland and the pace tedious.

I watched this 1996 film after being mildly disappointed with the 2017 remake. I had read the poor reviews of the remake (essentially regarding it as greatly inferior), seen the latest incarnation, and was certain that the original material had been spoiled by Hollywood. I assumed there had to be more to it. I was wrong. In actuality, the 2017 remake takes the subject matter more seriously than the original and delves into the conflict that a mind-wiped female cyborg may be experiencing in finding her true past or even understanding her own sexuality (noting that the 2017 scene with the prostitute had been edited for final release). The characters of the 1996 version are a naive happy-go-lucky bunch, despite working as an elite police squad in a society where we are led to believe that no one is to be trusted, and even our co-workers, who are the closest thing we have as friends, may be keeping secrets from us. And yet, in true frustrating manga fashion, the people asking simple questions are sincerely curious and caring, yet are content with vague, too-cool-for-school answers that only illicit more questions ...along with awkward silences and strange, coy smiles.

I will concede that this film may have spawned the themes of a thousand stories to come, but only because it failed to do so on its own. There are many minutes of this version where we are given simple images of our possible future's cityscape that could have been better suited for dialogue to intrigue us about the humanity themes this movie barely scratched the surface of.",1491868800,3,2078,5.002890173410405
777044,5,6304083777,"This is now ranked as one of my favorite movies. As other reviewers have said, it's based in the future, so plenty of sci-fi elements. The integration between humans and AI is more solidified. Nation states (sections?) are still affected by political corruption and hackers are a constant threat. The interesting concept here is the 'ghost' of those that are cybernetically enhanced and whether that refers to a soul, consciousness or individual personality traits remains in question.

Ghost In The Shell was produced, released, and brought to English speaking cultures during Anime's most groundbreaking era: the 1990s - and it shows. Remarkable for its inclusion of both hand painted and computer-generated visuals. Also remarkable for its mature themes of artificial intelligence, sentience, and what it means to be human. Like many cyberpunk classics, and not-so classics, Ghost In The Shell theorizes corporate and government manipulation via technology. All of this is set in a backdrop of crowded, high-tech slums - which have become a First World reality since its 1998 North American release. Both exciting to watch and allegorical of where human civilization is heading, Ghost In The Shell is a remarkable film worth watching - whether you're an Anime fan or not.",1485129600,,872,5.184397163120567

777671,5,6304083777,"A side note before I get started: My page shows Richard Epcar as the headlining actor. He's the English voice cast for ""Batou"". He has also voiced ""Genma"" for another popular anime, Ninja Scroll. ""Kusanagi"" is the main protagonist. She is voiced by Mimi Woods. Just a little bit of bother.

With the upcoming live-action version coming out, I felt a need to watch it again. With most good anime, there's a cohesive storyline. Ghost in the Shell has that in spades. You'll ask questions as to why things are happening and who particular people are. Everything is explained to you in the dialogue... Yes, you have to pay attention to the dialogue. That might throw some viewers off who might only like to watch anime for the action and artistry but the dialogue is important. It's well written and allows you to formulate reasons for what you think might happen later in the story.

I mentioned action and artistry earlier. This anime was made back when ink and paint was used and used well. The attention to detail was and is stunning. The action sequences hold up to what you'd see in live action films to this day (with the exception of The Raid 2 that has unbelievably well choreographed and brutal hand-to-hand combat sequences). With car chases, gunfights, brawling, and more explosions towards the end there's something for everyone in this movie.

I've watched the dubbed and subtitled versions. The English voice acting is well done. That personally makes or breaks the deal for me when watching anime. A feature can look as good as it wants to but if the voices don't mesh with the character I'm watching, I look for something else. Ultimately, Ghost in the Shell will not let you down if what you're looking for is a futuristic, sci-fi anime fraught with detailed dialogue, art and action.",1461369600,,1798,4.738019169329074

I literally almost wanted to stop the movie because of it. Then they play it again at the middle of the movie for like 10 minutes. Almost made me want to stop it again. The concept I think is cool and maybe the show is better. But I feel like the movie was too short to do anything really interesting. It almost felt like a 2 part show of an ongoing series. The ending to me was kind of anticlimactic and almost pointless. I had no connection to any of the characters really.

This movie was unfortunately dubbed in a time when anime received little to no love in the west. It is because of this that most dubs from this era are.. Well, bad.

This particular anime was visually striking and very good for what it was but by the end of the movie it felt like a very long one episode of a longer series.  Too much was left to the imagination of the viewer; and not in a good way.  The main character spent entirely too much time musing about her ""reality"" and you wonder how she ever became a high level cop or operative or whatever she was with that kind of preoccupation.  The nudity in the film carried on so long that it seemed gratuitous rather than, oh, this is what a female cyborg looks like with no clothes on.
Too long, too boring, and too confusing to be an enjoyable movie.

777746,5,6304083777,"I've watched Ghost in the Shell many years ago, so review is about the movie itself, not about this particular edition.
I will agree that it isn't comparable to Matrix. Yes, Wachowski Brothers were inspired by GITS, they took a lot of things from it, including the idea of ""life in the network"", but in Matrix, conflict of machines and humans is very primitive, there is nothing to think about. In fact, only ""The Second Renaissance"" from Animatrix raised a problem and gave some food for thoughts, but then Matrix 3 turned it all into a simple blockbuster, closing all the open questions by just saying ""shut up"".
But I also wouldn't directly compare GITS to the Blade Runner. GITS isn't a cyberpunk movie of troubled future. It is neither utopia not dystopia. There is even a 3 minute part (after Kusanagi talks to Batou on the boat) that shows the life of the city, which is kind of similar to what we had in 90's. But these 2 movies are very close in one of their philosophical problems. I would say that they complement each other. BR raises the question of how close an android can be to the ""human level"". GITS shows it from an opposite side - how small is that gap that make humans different, ""better"" than androids.
Definitely recommend it to people who enjoy using their cortex during movie watching.",1442966400,,1310,4.578723404255319

777784,5,6304083777,"This review is for the first DVD release of the original movie.
I bought this movie back in the late 90s after some friend suggested it. I'm not really a anime, comic, manga guy but the story and depth of what was happening really grabbed me. After not having watched it in years, I dusted it off for another viewing the the internet erupted in both joy and anger then a live action version of this 1995 movie was announced. Watching it again got me on a Ghost in the Shell kick when I found out that not only did it have a sequel, but that there were a few TV shows as well.
The general plot and themes presented in the narrative have already been covered very well by dozens of other reviews, so I won't bother with those details.

Pros:
When first released, Ghost in the Shell mixed CGI with classic animation techniques, which was a pretty unique thing to do at the time. Both hold up amazingly well considering how old this movie is now. What's more, the integration of the two is tastefully done and nearly seamless. I've seen clips of the updated version with newer CGI and don't care for it. In my opinion, if you are going to mix two mediums like that, it shouldn't be glaringly obvious which is which.
The narrative is a heady combination of political intrigue, science fiction, and philosophy that I wasn't expecting from a cartoon. In the US  animation is generally used for movies geared towards children. This movie is anything but. Beyond being beautiful, it really gets your brain spinning over existential questions like ""what does being alive even mean.""
The visual part of Ghost in the Shell is stunning enough, but what really hammers it home is the haunting soundtrack. Too often the title and ending credit music used in anime is so ridiculously inappropriate to what is happening that it ruins the experience. There can be something completely horrific happening and then the J-Pop music kicks in with some lyrics that, when translated, seem to have nothing to do with the movie. The title theme during the opening credits of this movie are solemn, eerie, and deeply stirring. The rest of the music through out sets the tense, surreal tone of the movie perfectly.
A welcome aspect for me personally was that the movie didn't feel ""too Japanese"" to me. The few other anime movies I've seen often have cultural references so steeped in Japanese traditions that they either goes over my head or are jarring. There are a few common themes in Ghost in the Shell that you have to work through, like all of the political jibber-jabber, but others like feeling isolated in a crowded city or questioning the nature of life are set up in a way that is approachable.
I'm able to deal with either subtitles or dubbing, so if you watch it both ways, you are really almost getting two different movies. The general plot is consistent, but the dialogue is very different.

Cons:
I honestly don't have any personal problems with this movie.
For some I would say that the plot may be too dense for them.
It is pretty violent and has heavy doses of female nudity, although no sexual content per say to worry about. Parents of young children should be wary.

Bottom Line:
Before we were given The Matrix to get our wheels spinning (which subsequently ground to a halt abruptly by two terrible sequels) Ghost in the Shell gave us a glimpse into a possible future where man and machine meet, raising some very serious questions about consciousness. Fans of that movie or Blade Runner (or the superior book it is based on) should really check out Ghost in the Shell. It has great action, a deep plot, and stimulates the mind.",1436832000,,3626,4.599690880989181
777785,3,6304083777,"This is an anime that really reminded me a lot of the Shadwrun tabletop RPG.  It was an okay anime and I will admit that I loved all the gunfights and the car chases were cool as well.  Plus the idea of implanting false memories into people's heads in order to get them to unknowingly do someone else's dirty work was a cool idea!

The main downside is that there are too many shots of topless robot women in it.  It's like they just threw some robot boobs in there in order to keep teenage boys interested.  If you ask me, the story is very good and it can stand on it's own without having to resort to using topless women to keep people's attention.

777787,5,6304083777,"NOTE: This review is based off of the recent Blu-Ray release by Anchor Bay. It was watched with the original Japanese audio and the English subtitles supplied.

 This movie is a classic, and looking back it retains all of its glory even 20 years after its release. The movie dedicates the first half of the movie to engulfing you into its setting, as well as give some background for what's to come later. The world is set in a futuristic city in Japan where cybernetic enhancements are the norm. Unfortunately, these mods allow for ""ghost hacks"", a method of mind control where someone's memories are replaced with fraudulent ones to give incentive to commit crimes. While the rest of the world is exhibited beautifully, some of this information about reasoning isn't too clear. Luckily, most of it hidden under technobabble, so it's easy to just accept it and forget about it. The world is beautiful, yet bleak; it's a fantastic setting for the story to be shown.

I don't want to spoil too much of the film, but the story is great. The undertones of man versus machine is a great addition to a movie already filled with the combination of the two. What separates a person from the manmade? Is the difference purely the brain's natural formation, or is it something deeper? These questions are touched upon, and definitely were attempted to answer, but it might not have been a complete success. Some of the arguments are hidden under dropped backstory or technology that isn't explained, and even the ending is dubious. Still, it is quite a trip to watch, especially the action sequence before halftime and the climax of the movie. My only complaint outside of some missing backstory is that my copy seemed to have some of the backgrounds scroll faster than the characters move, making it look slightly jarring, but that might just be a problem with my BD copy.

777808,5,6304083777,"A dark cyberpunk adventure that explores themes related to trans-humanism, evolution, and the human soul. Although this film was first released in 1995, it still has some of the best (and most memorable) animated sequences of any animated film.

If you aren't familiar with Ghost in the Shell, it originated as a manga that follows a Japanese anti-terrorism team that combats anti trans-humanists, hackers, and other cyber criminals. The film centers around the main character, Motoko Kusanagi, who has been augmented to the
point that she is more cyborg than human. This raises some interesting questions about life in a world where technology is integral to is existence.

The film is essentially a very condensed version of the original manga and focuses on Motoko's interaction with the main antagonist, a super hacker known as the puppet master. The films tone is much darker than the manga, but in my opinion that isn't a bad thing. There is a shocking amount of violence and nudity at some points so it definitely does not belong in the kids section.

Like the other two anime I saw previously (AKIRA and PAPRIKA), GHOST IN THE SHELL deals with human's relationship to technology and how it can positively or negatively affect the our collective experience. In this one, however, the primary philosophical concern is the nature of consciousness and what it means to be alive. In a world where artificial intelligence can exist independent of a physical form, would you consider it to be ""living""? That's just one of the many thought-provoking questions the film asks, and attempts to answer. From the technical side of things, I thought the hand-drawn animation was absolutely spectacular and the world-building was amazing as well. There was so much attention to detail that it made this future seem believable. I also liked the score which struck the right tone, kind of a BLADE RUNNER-esque futuristic noir. The only things I can find to complain about are really hardly complaints, though. First, a few of the voice actors in this dub were kind of awkward-sounding, and second, some of the computer animation/graphics date the film somewhat. Outside of that, however, everything here was exceptionally well-done. Overall, GHOST IN THE SHELL tells a fast-paced, intelligent story that has influenced science-fiction in so many ways (without this film, there'd be no MATRIX). If you're an anime fan, you've probably already seen it, but this would make a good entry point for those just getting into anime (like myself).",1427500800,12,2072,5.133136094674557

777840,5,6304083777,"Ghost in the shell was released in 1995 and is a classic anime film. It has spawned a number of spin-off series of varying quality. The plot follows the adventures of Public Security Section Number 9, their boss Chief Aramaki, Major Motoko Kusanagi and Batou. Motoko became a public icon as a strong female character. She is essentially a cyborg with an artificial body. The film has an iconic scene of the Major ""climbing"" down a building and fading from view through thermal camouflage. This is a scene that everyone should see at least once. The movie explores some complex identity issues and has a strong philosophical character. The combination of CG and cell animation enables some truly artistic visions to be explored and whilst it can look a bit dated now it still has immense visual power. The music, composed by Kenji Kawai, blends beautifully into the overall character of the film too. This is a classic that every anime fan should see at least once to understand how complex stories can be presented and to see how the genre has evolved. Highly recommended.",1419984000,,1072,4.8

Namely I am a massive fan of sci fi, where I was expecting a movie that makes you question whether or not robots or AI could ever develop consciousness, the science and math behind it, and like any good sci fi I was expecting to question reality as I know it. You know, the typical ""how can I expect to question whether a computer has a consciousness or not if I can't even prove my own wife or children have it.""

Unfortunately this movie is none of those things. It only gives the illusion its deep, when really its 1% sci fi and 99% naked anime action woman. This is not at all what I expected.

If you like movies like gattaca or the matrix, or interstellar, contact etc, and are looking for a movie in the same vain. You will be dissapointed. Ghost in the shell gives the illusion of deep undertones when really it doesn't challenge your mind at all.

I would say maybe this is intentional, since her character is an android trying to determine the meaning of humanity and if she in fact still qualifies as human, but it's not consistently monotone. It just sounds like a bad delivery.

It feels like a near miss for me, but I think that  I may watch it again at a later time and see if I missed any points that tie it together better.  I did find that the video quality and sound were not that good (I know that this is the original) and I found that a bit distracting. It is therefore possible that watching the Blu-ray version may be worthwhile if it has been cleaned up.

I enjoyed the story.  Although it does not seem terribly original in the post-Matix era, it must have been quite an interesting story when it came out.
However I can't help but wonder if the reason why it was such a big hit is that 14-year old boys would have gone crazy for the titillating sequences of a near naked robot/ghost slinking around in certain scenes.  I know it would have made a big impression on me had I been 14 when I first watched it!
However I can't help but view this film in the modern context and I did find it a little bit simplistic or cliched.  Maybe that's not being fair because i'm sure it's an influential work.  I enjoyed it, but maybe it's more suited to a younger demographic.",1408665600,,845,4.2625

In case that applies to you too, the series is called ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"". Apparently this is the first anime adaptation of the comic though, so it seems like a reasonable place to start if you are interested in Ghost in the Shell.

As such, I found it pretty disappointing. Some of my friends had talked up Ghost in the Shell and I remembered seeing a few episodes on Adult Swim and liking them. But I found the plot of this film too convoluted and not particularly interesting. There are interesting philosophical ideas brought up about human identity and the soul, and some of the art is pretty. Overall however I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected, primarily, I think, because I didn't really understand what was going on.

The plot is very fast and complicated: characters and major themes are introduced very quickly with no time for anything to sink in.

Cybernetic cops are after an unseen villain called The Puppet Master.  Several dubious agencies on the fringe are also involved.  But not much in the way of suspense is maintained.  Everything is handled on an apathetic level.  All the characters are uniformly flat (in more ways than one).  One character does more than just bare her soul (Major Motoko Kusanagi), at the most bizarre moments she suddenly strips naked and carries on with her duties that apparently just involve a lot of shooting, running, and dodging bullets, when she's not standing stock still and carrying on internal conversations.  Half of this film is stationary.  Just when you think you're dealing with a glitch in your DVD player, something moves.  For an animated film, very little of it is actually animated/active.  The backgrounds are fixed, there's little action to be had until a scene shifts to a shootout.  It's all rather blas.  To make matters worse, there are two extended, as in very long, musical interludes (one's a song, the other's just noise passing for music; both are arbitrary to the plot).  I know this is supposed to be a hallmark Anime film but I've seen (and kept for future viewing) better examples.  This film doesn't nearly provide as much adventure and excitement as it claims on the DVD cover.  But Siskel & Ebert did give it ""two thumbs up!""  And there is a legion of fans.

sadly marmoru oshi decided to go all george lucas and rework it.  he had pefectly well done sequences replaced with 3d ones that just broke up visual continuity and had the entire film tinted orange to force it to look like the sequal: innocence.  whats even sadder is that this '2.0' version now outpopulates the original in dvd versions and prevented the original from ever even making an appearance on uk shores in blu-ray format and because the original is superior to the messed up 2.0 version it seems you will struggle to find it without a high price tag.",1373587200,,1155,4.688118811881188

You don't need people passing away horrifically to make a good story. But I still liked it over all!

There were some scenes which, I guess, were supposed to set a mood and build the audience's empathy for the main characters through... slow scenery and shrill music... meh...

777976,5,6304083777,"I was in highschool when I first watched this movie. I had expected this to be one of the typical ""anime"" movies. Boy, was I caught off guard! I ended up with a miserable maldigestion - I wasn't intellectually mature enough at that time to understand the true implication of this movie. After I studied life science at a university, I have felt that the greatest feature of this movie is the dynamic imagination based on the essential understanding of ""life"".

The keyword of this movie is ""ghost"", which is a synonym for the ""mind"". In the world depicted in this movie, where the majority of the population has some parts of their body replaced by a machine, possessing a ""ghost"" is equivalent to being alive. In this movie, a ""ghost"" is born in the ocean of aggregated digital data. I do not find this part terribly outrageous, because even the modern science is completely incapable of answering ""the hard problem of consciousness (raised by David Chalmers etc.)"", i.e., ""where does the mind come from?"". The majority of the neuroscientists, actually, have abandoned the hope of answering this question.

The human being can be regarded as an information processing system which is composed of two major subsystems - a nervous system and a genetic system. It is noteworthy to point out that the information processed by both systems consists of digital data. In the world created in this movie, people are capable of storing their own memory outside their brain in the form of digital data, which led to the protagonists' crisis regarding their own identity.

The essence of sexual reproduction is the generation of a novel data sequence by shuffling the DNA code provided by a male and a female. This type of work is suited for computers rather than organisms, and that is exactly what happens at the end of this movie. At the museum, where the final battle takes place, the ""evolutionary tree"" depicted on a slate is torn by bullets, which leaves the word ""hominis(human)"". I was amazed by the effectiveness of this scene, which portends an evolution of life at an unprecedented level. Life, at which pinnacle lies the human being, ""shifts to an even higher level"". The grandiosity of this consummation is truly mind-blowing.

In my opinion, this movie will never become obsolete.

777978,5,6304083777,"I resuced this pre-viewed DVD when Blockbuster took a dump.  The first viewing was kind of confusing because of the interleaved political intrigue on top of more technological and moral issues.  Things become crystal clear on subsequent viewings. The soundtrack music is fantastic, as is the foley artistry. It asks some interesting questions about the definition of life so early in the infancy of the internet.

One strange feature of the film I still don't understand: thermoptic camoflauge.  I can imagine a trenchcoat that bends light around the person using it.  In fact, they chase a hacker through the streets with one on.  Now when it got pegged with bullets, it failed, and it looked like a tyvek body suit/trenchcoat combination.  He rips the thing off and wanders into a wet street fully clothed.  Now when Togusa wears it, (our lady agent in the film), she goes topless, frontless, and underwearless, yet retains boot/leggings and a gun holster strapped to her naked body.  OK--she's totally hot, but this film has a lot of boob in it.  Does the boob have purpose or is it just eye candy?  Maybe a fearless reader can fill me in...  And of course in Japanese style, they always mess around with gender for kicks--in this case project 2501 voiced by a male gets to inhabit a female cyborg body with--you guessed it--a nice rack (boobs!!!)  There's a famous scene where it (2501) is on the table in the lab getting powered up.  It gets all jiggly and the boobs--well you just have to see it for yourself.",1368921600,,1515,4.732824427480916

778064,4,6304083777,"The plot of this first ""Ghost In The Shell"" (GITS) movie takes a different direction than the series (Stand Alone Complex; S.A.C.) setting up an important plot element in the second GITS movie, ""GITS 2: Innocence"". Although the animation of this first movie is striking for its clarity and attention to detail, it does not rise to the level of the stunningly beautiful ""Ghost in the Shell 2:Innocence"".&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell-2-Innocence/dp/B0006A9FMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell 2 - Innocence</a>

Having said that, this GITS movie is the first time the creators devoted this amount of uninterrupted time to the things that make this franchise special: (1) As I stated above, the animation is crisp and the attention to detail is unfailing; yes (2) the creators use futuristic technology to enhance the characters' physicality and ability to use violence (""action""). But most importantly, (3) a well-crafted, well-written story was not abandoned or sacrificed on the altar of graphics/visuals. The crimes investigated by the members of ""Section 9"" are complex. This story, like all the GITS stories, is crafted on different ""levels"".  At one level, they're crime dramas,reminiscent of an episode of ""Law & Order"". There are plot twists and exchanges of dry humor between the characters.

At a deeper level, these stories are immersed in the ""deep politics"" of the fictional place and (future) time in which they occur. Likewise, they are immersed in the theme upon which the concept of GITS rests; asking the viewer one question: ""In (this vision of) a future where mechanical, computerized enhancement is the norm, what does it mean to be 'human'?""",1351209600,,1739,5.554716981132075

Although I used to love science fiction, at the age of seventy I find myself living in a world even beyond some of the science fiction of my youth, so I now rarely seek out science fiction, but I purchased this film because so many sources emphasized what an important film it was.

At the beginning of the film I was stunned by the exquisitely beautiful, soul wrenching women's vocal music.  As I got to know the extraordinarily powerful cyborg female who was aching to understand more about herself, I realized that the main theme music represented the main character's situation better than any other movie music that I could remember.

In the Special Features the various production staff members comment on the film shortly after its world premier.  The Musical Director, Kenji Kawai, praised the excellence of the sound and recording quality, but politely and modestly added that he was ""not so sure about the music though"" (even though he had written what might well be the best movie theme music ever)!

I just Googled his name and am happy to see that this theme is indeed recognized for the gem that it is, and that he is a prolific composer for films, tv, and video games.",1319500800,10,1267,4.633928571428571

778072,5,6304083777,"This anime was my first exposure to anime in general aside from my fanship of Dragon Ball Z.  I must say, I was absolutely blown away by this movie.  It was genius, deep, dark, philosophical and a powerful commentary on contemporary society.

The movie follows members of a special group of Japanese national police officers referred to as section 9 and encapsulates their feud with the foreign affairs branch denoted as section 6.  The movie focuses on two cyborgs who have human brain cells (ghosts) and their entirely human counterpart who are working to track down a hacker called the ""puppet master"".  This hacker has been hacking into the cyborgs and have been controlling them remotely and having them commit crimes.  The movie follows the investigation into the puppet master, the conspiracies rooted deep within the Japanese government and the reason behind the puppet master's modus operandi.

The movie is extremely existensial with deep dark overtones of nihilism.  The movie focuses on the vulnaribility of computers and how they are ultimately able to enhance our lives while at the same time creating an ever present danger to us.  The movie also delves into Japanese conspiracy theory and is a commentary on the increased reliance of society on machine in general as well as a commentary on how burecratic pissing matches can destroy a society from teh inside.

Definately go and pick up this movie is is absolutely phenominal.  The animation is great for its time.  Just a slight note, the music is very odd and pecuilur and certain aspects of this movie can be slow moving.

The DVD has two languages: Japanese with subs being default, but the subs can be removed, or the film played with the english dub.

The film:

The protagonist is a cybernetic denizen of the uncanny valley who is working for the government looking for hackers.  These are not the sort of hackers that invade company home-pages and replace them with random images, and turn out to be overweight 14 year old kids when they are caught.  These have a much cooler evil scheme.

The story goes about in the future, which happens to be rusty and used up, but unlike so many live action cyberpunk films the sun does shine in this one.  Which is how we can see the rust.  Then the sun goes down sowe can see the neon.  Can't have cyberpunk without neon.  Or at the very least a creepy guy called Neo.

Creepy things happen, stuff blows up, there is spectacle.

In the oriental style, the film states its message and ends.  That makes the film feel cut off at the end, but it actually said what it came to say, and didn't bother going into fireworks or other showmanship to do it.  It is more of an idea movie than an action movie - on the bright side it is an amusing idea you may have considered yourself or seen it on Star Trek.  In which case this can add something new, or just a different point of view.  Afterwards you could watch the series.  They are good, if different in many ways.",1256169600,,1605,4.42320819112628
778147,3,6304083777,"I saw this film around the same time as 'Akira', and was struck by the similarity between the two. 'Ghost In The Shell' has a similar sci-fi/cyberpunk atmosphere, and features outstanding animation and artistic quality. But there is also the same sense of style overcoming substance, and the whole experience left me feeling a bit flat.

First off, the animation: it was some of the best of its time, with a seamless integration of hand-drawn and CG elements. The anime really succeeds at bringing to life this futuristic, AI-dominated world. Just a pity it couldn't make a story to go with it.

Like 'Akira', 'Ghost In The Shell' is a compression of a very long manga, and again it feels too rushed and sketchy to satisfy. Apparently the story was taken from the very first and very last part of the manga, meaning the film has a first and third act but not a second. It really does feel as if the movie jumps straight from the set-up to the conclusion without much substance in between. At under 90 minutes, this film simply cannot do justice to its very complex, detailed story.

In a similar vein, the characters are given little room for development; they're all cold, ruthless, determined types, and the heavy focus on the Major means the remaining members of Section 9 are given cameo roles at best. Why does the Major look so different from her manga appearance? And all that nudity is just distracting.....yes, we GOT the point the first time....they overdid that concept to the point of it being gratuitous.

It's probably better to view the various television series first, or even better, to read the manga. Both of these do a much better job of fleshing out the story, environment and characters of this world. The film makes far more sense as an extension or conclusion to these series than as a stand-alone piece.",1255651200,2,1828,4.703125

778150,5,6304083777,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is an intricate masterpiece of cyber-punk fiction and storytelling, successfully melding intriguing philosophical ideas with a coherent, well thought-out (albeit) confusing plot.

Even more, it's a nightmarish vision of a society that's dominated by cyberspace and looking back now, is eerily prescient of today's computerized times. Many of the characters in the film are enhanced, someway or another by machines, to help them get the advantage in a vastly changing society.

I'll avoid going real deep into the plot simply because there's a whole lot to grasp and even I got more than a little confused trying to follow it. The story is that a team of high-level government operatives are hot on the trail of a notorious computer hacker called the ""Puppet Master,"" who is wanted for various crimes in cyberspace and has taken a particularly fond interest in the team's tough, female cyborg leader.

Not surprisingly, as with the stigmas surrounding Anime', ""Ghost in the Shell"" is not short of nudity and graphic violence. But it's far from being gratuitous, and does not slow down the movie at all.

""Ghost in the Shell"" was one of the first Anime' films to skillfully blend traditional drawn animation with computerized imagery. This helps to give the film a surreal, yet beautiful look. And the dialogue helps sometimes too, with helping to sort out the confusing plot and many of its mythical ideas about personal identity and human evolution.

This film is also even more revered today, in 2004, since some of this film's core themes helped to develop the plot basis of the insanely popular ""Matrix"" films, and some scenes from ""Ghost in the Shell"" were even homaged to in the first ""Matrix"" movie. The Wachowski Brothers certainly do owe a lot to this movie for the success of their work in America.

I think that to understand ""Ghost in the Shell,"" it would help to accept that Anime' is much more complex and daring than traditional American animation. Most Japanese animation films, like this one, ""Akira,"" or Mayazaki's ""Spirited Away,"" are on a level of sophistication that will never be matched in America.

It has been said that the majority of American audiences would be afraid of Anime' because of the many stereotypes surrounding it, but that's why it's boundless - it's been given free reign to use those stigmas to its advantage in developing truly remarkable pieces of art that have gone largely ignored here in the U.S. ""Ghost in the Shell"" could very well be a mere reflection or a parable of a doomed society that's probably already accepted its dark fate. Most American animation would never touch up on this sort of subject matter.",1251331200,3,2679,4.913716814159292
778151,5,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is one of the rare sci-fi movies that manages to entertain as well as pose interesting questions.  To often sci-fi is used as entertainment only with fun trappings of zipping space ships and explosions. There is a place for that kind of story and hell, I enjoy them.

But every once in a while I wish there was more stuff like Ghost in the Shell.  You get a interesting story with a resolution that makes you think.  On top of that, the animation is still stunning even over a decade later.  For me it ranks up there with the top tier animated films like ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Akira"".

First off the animation is very impressive for a number of reasons.  The backgrounds include amazing amounts of detail for a mid 90's feature.  There is some use of CG, but there is plenty of hand drawn stuff here.  The most stunning sequence is where the Major is journeying down the water ways of the city.  There is no dialogue, only animation and music.  The visuals show the city living around her, no freeze frames or still bodies, everything is moving and alive.  It starts to rain and the effect is amazing, transforming this near future metropolis into something beautiful and sad all at the same time.

Those familiar with the manga by Shirow will be a bit disappointed to see much of his character design has been revamped.  The characters are given a more realistic look and the comedy of the manga has been toned way down - instead the movie is deadly serious and very moody.

The action set pieces are top notch.  The two key ones are a chase into a crowded market place.  Again, everything is moving in the market, the villain is camouflaged and attempting a desperate escape.  The tension is high and the visuals are excellent.  The second involves the Major being seriously outgunned by a tank, and yet doing everything she can to turn the tables.  The animation is fluid and angles and mood are used to drive the intensity to a solid climax.

The story combines elements from the manga, picking up a villain here, a plot point here, a revelation there and mixing them all together.  Normally this type of approach could end up hurting the film and creating a mish mash of story lines.  But the writers have integrated all of it together very well.  The key story involves the puppet master and his quest to become something more.

It is the themes that are in the manga and are well executed in the anime that make this film work so well.  The character of the puppetmaster is interesting (and probably based off the idea introduced in the novel ""Neuromancer""), and it's quest is intriguing.  The ending always leaves me a bit chilled.  What kind of being has been created and what will it do.  The possibilities are endless.

The sound effects and music are well done and used to help create and sustain mood.  As I mentioned this mood is one of tension and melancholy.  The score is interesting in that it uses a very traditional Japanese sound and mixes it with a minimalistic and sparse soundscape.  It's very effective in the film, but I know several people that find the main theme to this film to be too discordant and irritating.  I think it fits in its own way, but I also understand their point of view.

Voice acting in Japanese fits the film a little better than the English cast does.  When I first saw the movie it was with the English cast and some of the lines just never seemed to click.  I'm not sure if they were playing the cyborg characters as robots or just trying to affect the gloom of the film in the voices, but it just didn't work.  The Japanese actors seem to have a better handle on it and the subtitled script seems a little clearer as well.

Director Mamoru Oshii takes all these pieces and adds his own spin on it.  Oshii is a man who takes his time telling a story.  Even though there are moments of explosive action, for the most part the movie moves at a slow pace, allowing the viewer to drink in the world of the film and most importantly the mood.  This creates a common complaint I see leveled against the movie - it's boring.  I see where the argument comes from, but I'm never bored watching it.  It is not an action film: it is an idea film with action in it.  The themes of humanity and identity are what drive the film - not the action.  As I mentioned this is very different from what Shirow did in his manga.  The themes were there and sometimes they were focused on, but it was done with more humor and more action.  It doesn't make Oshii's approach wrong, or Shirow's right.  In fact I enjoy both.  Oshii adapted the manga and put his own touch on it, and for me he struck a great balance.  This was disrupted a bit in his follow up which ended up sacrificing storytelling for philosophy - but that's another review.

This is not part of the ""Stand Alone Complex"" television series.  It does lead into the second feature film, ""Innocence"", but as I said it is not directly tied to Shirow's work.  Still it's a great price for a classic sci-fi anime.",1251158400,,5023,4.425764192139738
778152,5,6304083777,"Before I go off reviewing this anime masterpiece, I'll share my personal history with Ghost in the Shell, which dates back seven years ago.  Back in July of 2002, I had a bug to watch anime that came out of nowhere.  I went to the nearest Blockbuster and gazed at their meager selection of anime and the two VHS tapes that caught my attention the most were Akira (because I heard good buzz from friends) and Ghost in the Shell.  I noticed Ghost in the Shell because the tape box had a naked cyborg woman holding a gun and a ""mature audiences only"" sticker on it and my immature 14 year-old brain screamed ""Violence and nudity?  Yeah!!  This is gonna be awesome!!""  I had to have my older brother come with me because I couldn't rent these tapes by myself due to my age at the time and a little bit after midnight on July 17 (when everyone was asleep), I popped this baby in my VCR and I was blown away.  Much to my surprise, this had A LOT more to offer than superficial violence and nudity and I was very pleased with that.  Along with Akira two nights prior, this completely changed my view on the complexity and maturity animation can achieve since I was rather uncultured concerning ""adult animation"" since all I watched until then was stuff like South Park and The Ren and Stimpy Show (I'm not saying they're bad, they're all good, just not nearly as sophisticated.).  Needless to say, I was so impressed by both anime titles, at around that time, it was those two that made me want to pursue a career relating to animation.

PLOT

The plot is that in the year 2029, computers and the internet have taken over everything and cybernetic humans are so complex and powerful, they easily pass off as the real thing.  There have been a spike in reports of cybernetic humans getting ""ghost hacked"" by an elite hacker known only as the ""Puppet Master,"" Public Security Section 9 are ready to get to the bottom of the whole Puppet Master dilemma.  Major Motoko Kusinagi is a powerful female cyborg and second in command of Section 9 and while investigating the Puppet Master case, she begins to doubt her own ""human"" authenticity due to her being a cyborg.

COMPLEX, THOUGHT-PROVOKING THEMES

This is why I love Ghost in the Shell so much, it's not the type of movie where you can just veg out and  still be able to comprehend the film, you actually have to pay attention to it.  Another thing about GITS that's great is that the focal point of the movie isn't about catching the Puppet Master, but rather about the Major's relationship between her body and her ghost.  One of the most moving scenes involving the Major's dilemma has to be where she's on the riverboat as she stares at various windows of department stores and office buildings as she stares at them, she begins to see herself as the manikins or office employees.  The Major is consumed by angst over the fact that she doesn't know her origins or even if her ""ghost"" is an authentic state of consciousness or a collection of artificial memories to feel like such.  I particularly enjoyed the scene were Batou and the Major are on the boat and after the Major goes scuba diving (which she needs flotation devices otherwise she'll sink like a rock) in which the Major says to Batou how that when she surfaces from a dive, she feel like she's becoming a different person.  I especially enjoyed her explaining to him the aspects of personal uniqueness:

""There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind like all of the components that make up me as an individual with my own personality.  Sure, I have a face and voice to distinguish myself from others, but my thoughts and memories are unique only to me and I carry a sense of my own destiny.  Each of those things are just a small part of it, I collect information to use in my own way, all of that blends to create a mixture that forms me and gives rise to my conscience.  I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries.""

The Major is also disturbed by the fact that she can't evolve by any natural means since her cyborg body can't grow or change overtime, she's dying to embrace something new, so to speak.  After the cyborg suspected to have the ""Puppet Master"" itself inside it is snagged by Section 9, Motoko is dying to ""ghost dive"" into it and Batou dismisses the Major's inner struggle about herself and tells her to quit with the angst since she's treated like a normal human and the Major says one of the most memorable lines in the movie:

""But that's the only thing that makes me feel human, the way I'm treated.""

When the ""Puppet Master"" hacks into Section 9's security system and communicates with Chief Aramaki and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the ""Puppet Master"" says a lot of thought-provoking things, but to not spoil everything for you, here's what I think is one of the best:

""A memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind.""

As far as the themes about the meaning of being human, the advances of computers, and with the fusion of man and machine, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I'll let you watch the movie so you can absorb the other themes I didn't cover.

ACTION SCENES

While Ghost in the Shell isn't exactly an action anime, the action scenes it does have a rather inventive and cool.  For example, the scene towards the beginning where one of the Puppet Master's ""ghost hacked"" pawns tries to fight off the Major and her partners in Section 9, the pawn disguises himself with thermo-optic camouflage to make himself invisible and makes the shootouts more interesting.  The Major and Batou have to use infrared to find the invisible man and snag him.  The Major beats the guy at his own game by disguising herself with similar camouflage and hands his butt to the perpetrator in the process.  Needless to say, the scene towards the end where the Major battles a mecha-tank with only a machine gun is one of the most intense battle scenes I've ever seen in anime.

ANIMATION, ARTWORK, AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS

Ghost in the Shell is very revolutionary to be one of the first anime titles to incorporate computer graphics into traditional cel animation.  Best of all, the computer graphics are used to enhance the cel animation rather than use it as a crutch.  One of the best examples of this is right before the Major beats the snot out of a ghost-hacked criminal, there's a thermo-optic silhouette of her that zooms in on her head that looks so fantastic and despite that this was made in 1995, it could compete with computerized special effects in today's animated work.  The other special effects, particularly the simplified computer-generated images of the city and of the complex scans of cyborg brains are very, very impressive.  The animation itself is excellent, the characters and other animate objects move very fluidly as if they were real.  And as far as the smoothness of frame rates goes, it easily competes with Akira and the animated films from Studio Ghibli (in other words, as close to perfection as possible).  The artwork of the characters, vehicles, buildings, and everything else are all absolutely fantastic.  The characters have that ""anime"" aesthetic to them but at the same time, look much more ""human"" than the typical anime character.  The surroundings and high-tech stuff have TONS of detail attached to them.  You can clearly tell that these people didn't cut corners ANYWHERE.  I also love the colors used in Ghost in the Shell as everything seems to have a dark tint to create a feeling of uneasiness and even some fear in the depths of a futuristic Hong Kong.

MATURE CONTENT

This anime is recommended to viewers that are 17+ years old due to graphic violence and nudity.  I felt that both were used very tastefully as they were only used in scenes when necessary.  Also, contrary to what many of you are thinking about the Major's camouflage suit, she's NOT naked when she engages camouflage mode.  Her camouflage suit is merely the same color of her skin.

SOUNDTRACK

The soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell is outstanding.  Kenji Kawai did an excellent job on his behalf as this really is a big part of the whole GITS experience.  The soundtrack consists mostly of minimalist, dark ambient electronic music intertwined with ethnic Japanese female choirs and even some ethnic percussion.  The soundtrack in general sends chills down my spine, particularly the scene where the Puppet Master is in Section 9's headquarters and is lecturing everyone about his origins.  The music track in that scene has a droning electronic passage accentuated by church bells to create the ultimate form of  ""doom music.""  That music track by itself is unnerving, but when coupled with the dark visuals in that Puppet Master scene, will make anyone clench their whole bodies like a fist in fear.

EXTRAS AND FEATURES

Since I have the two-disk special edition of Ghost in the Shell, I'll delve into the special features of that edition of the movie.  Overall, I felt pretty pleased with the extras, particularly the Production Report and Digital Works featurettes.  The Production Report is in English and while it gives a somewhat simplified exploration into the production of GITS, it offers neat interviews with cast and production members and even of Masamune Shirow himself, who is depicted as a drawing for the interview since he doesn't like having his actual face shown in the media.  The Digital Works featurette was the best part.  It's in Japanese and give a much more in-depth exploration of how GITS was made.  Before watching the Digital Works segment, I thought the integration of CGI into cel animation wasn't that difficult but boy was I wrong!!  They needed a lot of different software to get GITS done, infact, the warehouse featured towards the end of the movie had to be constructed with CAD software to be done right.  There's even dossiers for the key characters in GITS, and while not really that big of a deal, are a nice addition to the DVD.  My only big gripe with the special edition is that there's no slide show of concept art, storyboards, vehicle designs, production artwork, or anything along those lines.  You'd think that something like Ghost in the Shell that's so involved with visuals would have something like this by default for the fans but sadly that's not the case.  There's also a bunch of trailers for other Manga titles and of promotional trailers for GITS.  There's a multitude of language tracks for this edition of GITS, but honestly, I'm pleased with only watching it in English and Japanese.  There's a dual-sided foldout poster with one side of the promotional image used for Ghost in the Shell while the other side features a nude Motoko floating against a computerized red backdrop with a bunch of wires and tubes attached to her body.

FINAL WORD

In terms of anime, Ghost in the Shell is a superb feast for the eyes and the brain.  This anime will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the initial viewing with its intense action and nail-biting intrigue throughout the film and when it's all over, it'll leave you wondering about many, many things about humanity and technology.  I raise my ice-cold shotglass of Stolichnaya vodka to Mamoru Oshii for making such a timeless, excellent anime.  In a time where the words ""masterpiece"" and ""art"" are thrown around way too much by unseasoned, newer anime fans, Ghost in the Shell is one of the really few titles that truly deserves the title.  If the cyberpunk themes in Ghost in the Shell are your cup of tea, I suggest that you check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armitage-III-OVA/dp/B0009X7600/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armitage III: OVA</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-Files-1-3/dp/B0002J4X3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D.

778153,5,6304083777,"Believe it or not, there is still a large portion of the general public that believes that animation is a genre of entertainment that is for children.  One shot of this classic cyberpunk anime would kill that notion dead.  ""Ghost in the Shell"" is to anime what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>&nbsp;is to Hollywood: a modern classic science fiction masterpiece that defines the genre and even transcends it with a spectacular relevance to both the present and future of humanity's technological advances.  GITS can easily stand alongside the the best works of the genre and is absolutely required viewing for fans of sci-fi.  Combining the classic themes of artificial intelligence run wild, synthetic humanity, and cyberspace and adding in touches of noir, espionage, action, fantastic visual effects, and a unique overall sensibility GITS delivers in every sense.

The tale begins with the top secret Section 9's star agent, a cyborg nicknamed The Major, carrying out one of the coolest assassinations in film history to prevent the possible defection/abduction of a technician with some very sensitive information.  In addition, a criminal hacker known as The Puppet Master has began hacking the cyberbrains of humans with cybernetic implants and using them for dubious purposes.  As the plot thickens we find that espionage is only the beginning and that indeed we may be looking at the final step in the evolution of human and machine alike.  But before the heavy existential philosophy fully kicks in there are some seriously killer action sequences to enjoy.  GITS is heavy on nudity and has a few shots of seriously brutal gore to sate your bloodlust (or regular lust, you pervert), but neither are a good reason to see this film.  A story that makes you seriously question the value of your own humanity and existence is a success any way you look at it and that's what this anime offers in part. A side-by-side comparison of the data that defines each and every one of our identities with the data that could make up a virtual entity yields few meaningful differences, especially in a future where humans routinely replace their bodies and even their brains with artificial ones.  And should the data that makes up a virtual existence find a way to integrate itself into another similar being and create a third being mixing traits of both parent entities, is that any different from our physical reproduction and evolution?  Indeed, what is to there to stop us as beings comprised entirely of information from simply ceasing physical existence altogether and taking to the limitless depths of the net itself?  This is what great science fiction is made of.

As human and computer become more and more compatible with one another it will be extremely interesting to see what the future holds.  GITS has spawned a Blade Runner-esque&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/direct-sequel/dp/B001K98MFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">direct sequel</a>, a much lighter-themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/television-series/dp/B000HIVQAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">television series</a>, and another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/movie/dp/B000PWQPAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">movie</a>&nbsp;based on the television series.  All are good, but none has captured the sheer originality and brilliance of the original.  The relevance of this work will never be diminished and the subtle but poignant political and social commentary is there if you want it.  Read between the lines of the opening text's explication that in spite of the advances in technology and communication racial and national distinctions remain for a little personal philosophy suggesting that such meaningless distinctions may have overstayed their usefulness.  And being as that is the case, perhaps  the answers to humanity's problems lie in leaving physical and geographical differences behind altogether and creating an existence for humanity that is a bit more more....infinite.  Food for thought.",1245974400,,4207,5.920661157024793
778154,4,6304083777,"The film receives the highest possible figure on any scoring system from me.  From the smooth and vibrant animation, the well developed characters and smooth pacing, the great direction and the atmosphere it creates, the stunning suggestions of the future and their execution,  the action and the intrigue, and of course the philosophical musings and the concepts they explore with quite a bit of depth..it's all near perfect.

This particular DVD release of said film gets a 4/5.  There are some very good things about this package, but there are also some very glaring flaws.  You would think Manga Entertainment would give the utmost care to any and all releases pertaining to such an acclaimed and important film.  That they wouldn't have very bland disc art or flimsy image quality on the free poster inside.

But they do.  The discs are horrid looking.  It's quite a shame, since the rest of the packaging is quite nice.  The digipak is shimmery and attractive and the slipcase around it eye-catching.  The disc content itself is very nice, the menus do not disconnect from the mood of the film.  The extras are quite dated compared to the film,  but that's one of the reasons why the film is great.  There's lots of extras here, but the second disc's space is mostly taken up by an elaborate maze of advertising.

The new cleaned up version of the film is done quite well.  What's new?  Nothing is inserted, nothing is altered.  The color and sharpness is enhanced and film spots are taken away.  Purists take no fear, it is the original film with slight enhancements for the better.  Should you buy this?  Only if you can't stand to wait for a better edition to come (which is only eventual given the historical importance of GITS).  It's quite perfect for those die-hards who really can't wait, because the new transfer really does look kickass on the home screen.",1240790400,5,1873,4.751552795031056
778155,1,6304083777,"The only reason I am even commenting on a movie that I care so little for, is its unanimous praise.  This is not just a review on ""Ghost in the Shell"", but a critique on the wider world of anime.  As a long time student of illustration and fan of 2D animation, I can honestly say that this movie encapsulates everything that is wrong with anime and its fans.  As in most touted anime films, most of the animation and set design of this movie are excellent.  The basic plot is also highly creative.  These have never been weak elements in anime.  The problem is that fans and creators of anime obsess over these things and forget that they are  not what carry a film,  characterization and human expression carry a film.  Whether animated or live action, characterization and a dynamic between characters are what draw a viewer in.  The problem with this is that actors emote with there face, and anime characters have stone-dead ones for some reason.  It is predictable and excruciating how characters in ""Ghost in the Shell"", and all anime films, will be allowed to monotonally dribble lines back and forth at each other for minutes at a time with less emotion than a crash test dumby; there mouths will part and unpart robotically, while there faces and eyes do nothing.  If there faces do do anything, they are forced and exaggerated attempts at suprise, pain, or fright. The great Disney animators understood that for every word a person speaks, there is an elaborate dance that takes place within the structures of the face.  This is why there is more humanity in any one disney character than  all of the anime characters you will ever watch.  People like anime because they appreciate 2D animation as a form of moving paintings and want it to be more than a vehicle for children's cartoons.  The truth is, this movie is no more than a contrived meditation on artificial intelligence and existentialism.  Most anime movies are contrived meditations at best and senseless filth at worst.  This is how it will remain until anime animators and writers understand that 2D animation will not hide there inadequacies, only bring them out.",1239667200,10,2138,4.732432432432432

778220,3,6304083777,"I'm not usually a big fan of anime, sure, I was into it for a year or two but after that it wasn't a real draw.  Revisiting Ghost in the Shell however, I was surprised to find that I actually liked it more than the first time around.  Maybe it's because I can appreciate the philosophical and psychological ideas presented or maybe it's because I have a more experienced eye for what makes good cinematography.

Philosophically this definitely isn't the deepest examination of the concepts of self, sentience and life but it's very effective in the way it presents these questions and it doesn't try to hand you any answers in gift wrapping like many similar films.

From a cinematography and animation standpoint it certainly is one of the best of it's kind in the genre of anime and rivals many of the best western 2D and 3D animation in that sense.  In particular, I think it's great edit, very effective music and superb camera shots shine so vividly.

However, I don't actually feel like the narrative of the story is particularly good, the pacing is okay but I never really felt like I identified with the characters--which I think is really important for this film--and I certainly didn't believe they could be real.  I'm often a fan of movies leaving things wide open but this one didn't even feel like there was any ending, maybe it was just it's short length.

Ghost in the Shell is a shining example of an anime that I think transcended the genre, but I'm not sure I would really want to sit through it again.",1229212800,,1520,4.5625

One pair, Maj. Motoko Kisangani and Batou, are tracking down an infamous, anonymous cybercriminal, alias ""The Puppetmaster"".  He's a cyberterrorist on the international most wanted list, sometimes viewed as a virus within the mainframe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>), and he's feared the world wide.  His specialty is ""ghost hacking"", which is essentially breaking into the brains and souls of other cybernetic beings wired into the system, controlling their movements (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>?).  He's been tapping into major political figures, and using humans as his lackeys by inserting false memories and lives, a simultaneous reality and fantasy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Total-Recall/dp/B00070FX5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Total Recall</a>).  During the rundown, Kisangani taps into the mainframe via ports in the back of her neck (Matrix) to trace the last known hacks.  The Puppet Master is shown to be creatively conniving villain, with an arsenal of powerful weapons and thermoptic camouflage (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B000244EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>) at his disposal.  His insidious secondary goal, however, sheds light onto the complicated concepts of life and the philosophical ""existence precedes essence"" concept of robotic/cybernetic existentialism (Short Circuit, Wall-E, Steve Guttenberg in every Police Academy movie).

What I found very interesting was the concept of ""ghost hacking"".  Breaking the barriers of others' brains, people who are wired into the system - technological brain control - doesn't seem to be all that unlike the trance placed over droves of easily persuaded, technologically-dependant teens of today.  What happens in the movie may be a little more direct, but the results are nonetheless similar.

One other very compelling concept is the creation of a perfect being.  Whether it's Ghost in the Shell, The Fifth Element, or Weird Science, the perfect being usually ends up being a naked or scantily clothed woman, usually appearing in either a vulnerable or fetal position (Terminator).  I agree wholeheartedly with this concept.

Based on Masamune Shirow's manga (Japanese comic) with screenplay by Kazunoki Ito and directed by Mamoru Oshii, the film attained an award-winning worldwide acclaim not just because it revolutionized current animation standards but also because of its enormous plotline. The film heritage can be traced back to Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and the Japanese anime ""Akira""; but it went on to inspire blockbuster Hollywood films such as ""The Fifth Element"", ""Dark City"" and even the Wachowski Bros'. ""The Matrix"". It is also the winner of the 1997 WORLD ANIMATION Celebration Awards. (Best Theatrical Film and Best Director)

2029 A.D., a time and place in an undetermined future where the fusion of humans and machines, the network and human comprehension has been attained. People have been enhanced by cybernetic implants that makes them stronger, faster, smarter. Section 9, a group of cyborg cops led by Maj. Motoko Kisangani (voiced by Atsuko Tanaka) and Batou (Akio Atsuka) are caught in political intrigue as they search for answers to a mysterious ""Puppet Master"" or as it would like to call himself; Project 2501. Their investigations have led them to believe that this ""ghost"" hacker is the one responsible for numerous attacks on public mainframes that changed financial, network manipulations. Findings have led them to conclude that the ""hacker"" may be an artificial computer intelligence that seeks to co-opt a synthetic body for its own needs.

This anime feature is a dramatic thrill-ride that would be an excellent introduction to Japanese animation with the depth of its script and the complexities of its plot. The story is so rich with philosophical undertones of existentialism and social relations. The cinematography is fantastic and the animated visuals is a ""merging"" or digitizing of traditional cell animation, computer generated graphics and live-action footage (although one would be hard-pressed to notice). The marvelous compositions and set pieces may cause one to forget that he is watching an animated film. The film is also shot with a lot of moving perspective to convey its mood. The animated invisibility (when Kusanagi gets totally naked) is a first during the time of its release While its premise is almost excellent, the visuals is also its main showstopper, even for today's standards.

The film is a philosophical movie, and while there are quite a few sequences of action, one of which highlights Kusanagi going up against a robotic tank with enormous firepower, the film is full of emotional content, very brooding and quite moody. Shall I say it even contains quite a lot of drama with a restrained amount of human (?) angst. If you approach the film as you would any other action-inspired anime then you will be lost in its translation. The film may be a little slower-paced than most anime features but I found this very inspiring and a refreshing approach. It deliberately takes its time to express its mood through its slow-revelations. It is quite ingenious for director Oshii to abandon the usual dynamics of fast-paced scenes. It allows the viewer to ponder the different existential and social points it is making and take everything in.

What makes an individual? What makes one attain individualism? Is it memories and experiences? The supposed thin line between humanity and cybernetics is drawn in the character of Maj. Kusanagi. She is a female operative who ""died"" before but is now able to live in an enhanced cyborg body. The main antagonist ""the Puppet master"" causes her to question her very existence--just how much of her is still human? How can one whose entire body is composed of cybernetics and synthetics be any different from a simple machine? Is Motoko Kusanagi a ghost in a cybernetic shell? Can a machine gain sentience through experiences and generate a ""soul""? These are the complex questions that the film delves into--quite impressively I have to say.

The film's main strengths are its groundbreaking visuals, mature and complex storyline and its reliance on emotion and mood rather than a hectic screenplay. Those who are looking for the usual ""shoot them up"" anime feature may be a little disappointed. While there is action to be had with ""Ghost in the Shell"", it is NOT an action animated film but a very philosophical sci-fi drama. I only have one response to those who question the reasons as to why Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece is so highly acclaimed, it paved the way to current animation techniques but it didn't stop there; it took its time with a mature and complex storyline that is definitely not for kids but for those esoteric few very adulterated to Japanese type of storytelling. Mamoru Oshii's ""GHOST IN THE SHELL"" surpasses most of Hollywood's big-budget output, BOTH in style and substance even up to this day. It wasn't a huge box-office success in its U.S. theatrical run, but nonetheless its thoughtful and interesting storyline cannot be matched  by any box-office popcorn giant--its non-mainstream appeal is its greatest strength. One of the great Sci-Fi masterpieces.

778269,5,6304083777,"Ghost In The Shell' (released 1996 in the U.S.) by director Mamoru Oshii was a real butt-kicker for its time and brought renewed interest to Japanese Animation from North American film critics long after the landmark emergence of Akira (1988). The highly cerebral and detailed scriptwriting brought raves from some critics, while the sometimes altered translated English-dubbed version brought baffled reviews from others.

While there are some great animated cinematic-styled action sequences, the film is still also an intellectual and philosophical mystery maze with characters struggling with the meaning of survival in a cybernetic world - themes that would years later influence and inspire the Wachowski brothers as they explored similar themes in 'the Matrix' trilogy.

Along with possibly being one of the first original and sophisticated cyber-mystery thrillers, 'Ghost in the Shell' was also one of the first anime that appeared to integrate the old ink, cell, and paint methods into computer CGI digital graphics thoroughly and successfully to a seamless level of cinematic film mastery.

(Back in the 80's, 'Akira' was still heavily using cell graphics and original BG paintings, while another early CGI anime in the 80's,'the Lensmen"", still had computer technology in its underdeveloped early stages - the differences between CGI and Cell animation could be easily observed by the viewer.)

Kanji Kawai's striking operatic music beautifully enriches and enhances the mood of 'Ghost in the Shell'. The music classically and digitally bridges the new with the old.

Still, the qualitative uniqueness of the movie comes down to its detailed and highly complex science fiction screenplay, which is similar in sophistication and spirit to the ones that exists in films like 'Blade Runner' and '2001 A Space odyssey' (and also to some degree Pixar's new 'Wall-E'). These are the type of films that force the viewers to think at times while going along for the ride. (And it appears that films like these just don't come along very often.)

But if that gets too boring for some viewers there's still always enough stylish but brutal butt-kicking by Motoko (Major) Kusanagi and Batou to keep any viewer tuned into the cyberpunk thriller right to the very end.

778272,4,6304083777,"This is the first ""Ghost in the Shell"" movie to have been based on the popular manga. It's set in 2029, apparently in Hong Kong, and follows the agents of Section 9 - a government agency that deals with unsavoury (and frequently criminal) elements. Life is very different : the internet plays an much greater role in life than it does now, while most people now have technology-enhanced bodies. These improvements range from controlled metabolisms to cybernetic bodies.

Section 9 has a small, though clearly very effective team. Daisuke Aramaki is is charge, though takes no active part in the missions - a rather elderly gentleman, he deals with bureaucrats, politicians and reports. (In fact, he life seems to ne so busy that her doesn't always get to read the reports submitted to him). Major Motoko Kusanagi effectively operates as the team leader in the field. Kusanagi is a cyborg - a human brain fitted in a metal body  that features some very cool optional extras. Batou is not only a very experienced officer, he is also - apparently - the closest thing the Major has to a friend. While he is primarily biological, he does have some quite significant implants - most obviously his eyes. Togusa, who has virtually no implants at all, is the most recent arrival to Section 9. He was recruited by Kusanagi herself, who views diversity as a strength. Ishikawa, meanwhile, barely appears at all - he acts as Section 9's computer expert and doesn't6 take part in any of the fighting.

As the film opens, Section 9 has been helping the Ministry of Foreign Affairs deal with a couple of difficult political asylum cases. (The individuals requesting asylum were proving to be as unsavoury as those they were requesting asylum from...Section 9's involvement meant no awkward decision had to be made by Minister Nakamura). At the same time, Nakamura is building up to a round of very secret talks...disturbingly, it would appear that the talks and the delegates are now under threat. The Minister's Interpreter has been attacked, with the technological upgrades to her brain proving her weakness. These upgrades have been hacked into, by a shadowy terrorist known only as the Puppet Master. This process is known as Ghost Hacking, and is an attack on the victim's very consciousness. It allows the hacker to alter his victim's memories - essentially destroying their very identity. The interpreter, the Monkey Man believes, would have been used by the Puppet Master to kill the key delegates at the talks - and everyone involved with these talks is now under surveillance.

There is very little to go on as to the Puppet Master's true identity. The ""infamous Master Hacker"", whose nickname was coined by the Ghost Pack, is believed to be American. However, any remaining details - age, background and (despite the moniker) even gender - are all a matter of speculation. However, this incident is the first confirmed Puppet Master attack in Hong Kong - and it seems clear that, for whatever reason, Nakamura's round of talks is his intended target.

The film features some great artwork and is very atmospheric. With the Major, in particular, there is a very clear and real sense of isolation. This stems from the fact she is largely technological, rather than biological - ""cyborgs"", she says ""have a tendency to be paranoid about their origins"". Ironically enough, she's not alone in her loneliness - despite how much easier technology has made it to communicate, it's a mood that seems all too common throughout the city.",1212278400,,3522,4.912605042016807

778277,3,6304083777,"Though having had a lukewarm reception in Japan, director Mamoru Oshii's film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga was hailed in America as one of the most groundbreaking animated movies of its time and has made anime itself a staple in mainstream pop culture.  But whether the relentlessly hyped ""Ghost in the Shell"" still maintains its beauty rests in the eye of the beholder.

In a world where technology dictates everyday life but fails to erase nations and ethnic groups, the agents of Section 9, a secret organization, are on the hunt for the Puppet Master, a mysterious hacker infiltrating the digitized brains of government officials.  As ""Major"" Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg soldier, delves deeper into the mystery, what she finds leads her to question her own existence, as well as the bond between man and machine.

Among the first films to use traditional cel animation with computer animation the visuals, while nothing new to most of us, were quite a feat in the film's heyday.  From the creation of the Major's cybernetic body to her wandering through the inner-city streets, the results simply speak for themselves.  As for the story, one of political intrigue, espionage and spirituality, is actually simple to follow once you get pass all that jargon.  Like the manga, eye candy is also prevalent here; since Major's body is completely prosthetic, she doesn't seem to mind showing off all that (fake) skin.  But if anything complements the film to perfection, it's the soundtrack composed by Kenji Kawai, featuring a haunting Japanese wedding song which goes well with the image of the ""marriage"" of man and machine.

And yet all the other billions of people in the world, each of them was also the center of the universe, and only perceived of it what THEIR senses showed THEM.  We were all trapped in our own heads, as though we were all in Separate Universes.  Wow!  Eventually, somebody put it into my head to wonder how I could PROVE that anything but myself really existed at all.  I would touch things and think ""Am I really touching this, or do I just THINK I'm touching this.""  And then - but oh, wait!  I am so sorry. Am I BORING you?

If NOT, then you might like this movie, which is about a woman who stares at the floor a lot and ponders in monotone the fact that she is an android.  Her body and much of her brain have been replaced by cooler android updates which make her smarter and more kick than the average human.  But IS she still human?  Does she have a soul?  Why is she asking that question when a soul is something which shows up on a scanner in this movie anyway?

""What is me"" she wonders, ""Am I my hand, my arm, my big soulful eyes (closeup please), my soft brown hair which keeps waving in every breeze?  Is it this really sturdy android body that I strip naked at every opportunity so that the viewer can stare at it, and stare at it, and stare at it some more, and chastely ponder the fact that it is not a real body, while my partner chivalrously avoids staring at it just as though it was a real body, even though it is not.  And when you are not staring at me or watching him NOT stare at me, let's have long dreamy shots of the city, which pause at store windows to stare at the mannequins within, so you can further ponder what the difference is between those artificial bodies and MY artificial body.  Because that is a very important difference to ponder, and we must make really really sure that everyone in the audience ponders it whether they give a rat's rear end or not.""

The animation is seriously excellent, so much so it is probably enough for those who already know and love the story and characters from other sources.  But judged on it's own, this film hardly thinks much of the viewer's intelligence.  Other films this has been compared to, MATRIX and BLADE RUNNER, might not have been perfect, but they took their main Idea and made it a story.  GITS takes an idea and has people stare out the window thinking about it.  You can get more Deep Concepts in a single paragraph of HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.  Either GITS doesn't really have anything to say, or the manga had TOO much to say, and the movie chose not to even tackle it.  The plot is a convoluted mystery in which we must put a good deal of effort into following, despite that we have zero emotional investment in anyone involved, with an ending reminiscent of bad Star Trek.  I personally found it wearisome and even overlong, but what is boring to some might have a meditative quality to others.

This film leaves me with zero desire to read the manga or see the series, a reluctance to attempt any more ""classic anime"", and some horrible STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION flashbacks.  For some reason it also gave me the urge to look up Wordsworth, whom I have not read since freshman English, so I got something out of it.",1169337600,9,3407,4.251552795031056

That being said, I cannot give the movie such a high rating. It seems to miss some of the magic from the original manga, and although the main plot is essentially the same, there are a number of things that made the movie seem comparatively empty. While in the manga you got to see a fair amount of character development and a large variety of action sequences, in the movie the characters seem rather bland and the action seems limited.

The parts that were used from the manga for the film seemed to have been translated from paper to film perfectly, but so many essential parts were left out.

Overall, if I had not previously read the manga, I would have possibly given the movie a much higher rating.

From start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline. I think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough. There is a lot of violence and some language. Also, some slight nudity, but very non-sexual. Overall, I think this is one of the best anime ever.",1144368000,,590,4.5233644859813085

I'm intirgued by how it has been dubbed into english, there are lots of blank spaces in the dialogue and stillness in the image that I'm guessing might come from a more involved Japanese original. The effect is that sometimes the pace looses dynamism, All in all though its an astounding vision and what really mkes it is the depth of the surround sound track, alongside some really great drawing of course.",1142985600,4,450,4.782051282051282
778439,5,6304083777,"In Mamoru Oshii's outstanding Ghost in the Shell (1995), the director/writer gave himself little time, at less than 90 minutes, to explore the many questions he raised in that script.  With his long-awaited sequel, Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence, he succeeds in answering many of these questions whilst at the same time giving us many more to ponder, in a film that, though flawed, deserves a 5 star rating.

Rather like a Disney animation, the film can be viewed on more than one level by more than one audience.  On the surface it is a sumptuously-animated film in which a fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds; robots are murdering humans, and a crime specialist is brought in to solve the case.  Period.  We have already seen equivalent plots in films such as Blade Runner or I, Robot and this film has nothing new to add to the basic idea.  However Oshii's world is far more disturbing and complex below the surface.  He subverts the ending of the film which, could be taken as a triumph of good over evil.  However, when distinctions between robot and human become blurred the central notions of good and evil in the film fall down.  He pulls other tricks to undermine our assumptions about humanity; at one point the main cop character puts a coat over a robot to hide its nakedness; another time a robotic character philosophises over the meaning of existence, whilst chain-smoking.  It is in the director's treatment of the paradox of what it means to be human that the film's value lies, not the superficial plot.

Characterisation is a little scimpy (with the notable exception of the depiction of Oshii's own basset hound, which is drawn with clear devotion) but visually the film is stunning.  Oshii is one of the few directors able to practice the delicate art of inactivity on screen.  He is not scared to abandon the plot for minutes on end to luxuriate in, for example, an extended arial shot of a city, or to dwell on a completely motionless face whilst we register its owner's emotional state, or to allow his main characters, motionless on the screen for what seems like ages, to quote western philosophical and religious texts.  None of these scenes moves the plot forwards and yet the film would be immeasurably poorer without them.

Too many sequels to outstanding films try to provide glib answers to the issues raised in the original and most fail by this approach; examples such as 2010 and Matrix Reloaded spring to mind.  With this film Oshii has avoided this pitfall and given us a rare sequal, that takes the theme of the original and finds something fresh to say.

In summary, the film deserves a 5 star rating, but I think that it falls short of greatness.",1142985600,9,2696,4.714285714285714

Plus, the whole idea of The Puppet Master has to be one of the all-time great concepts for a villain.  The notion of a hacker using you and not only wiping out your real memories, but also creating false ones really plays out in a terrifying way in this movie.

778516,2,6304083777,"Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.

There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.

The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.

The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.

In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex.",1140220800,3,2651,4.563025210084033
778517,5,6304083777,"The first time I rented this movie, I fell asleep half way through. The second time, I fell asleep again. Undeterred, I went on to watch the first season of the Stand Alone Complex TV series and then to read the original GITS manga in its English-language collected form. Having been hooked by the ideas and the characters, I came back to the movie and instead of finding it slow and somewhat impenetrable, it struck me as far too constrained by time limitations to do the story justice. So I guess it all depends on your viewpoint and how much you already know about the world in which GITS is set and the characters who populate it.

Now I am a lot more familiar with the GITS world, I would strongly recommend that anyone struggling with the original movie does stick with it, and then goes on to watch the TV series as well. The latter may not have the same production values but does have the time to expand on many ideas and develop the characters much better than the film could possibly do.

This is a world in which people can truly live ""inside their heads"" (or indeed, other people's heads) and in which the external body has largely become insignificant. This is a very attractive concept for anyone who already tends to think this way and regard their brain as their most significant body part, if not the only one. It's a world in which physical pain and sickness is limited to those who have not chosen to become full cyborgs, sexuality is potentially irrelevant as anyone with a cyber-brain can switch to an outwardly opposite gendered body, and we can presume that lifespans are extended and far more predictable than they are today. But there are flaws in this futuristic Shangri-La, not the least of which is that people are still people and however perfect their bodies may be, they still struggle with concepts of identity, still strive for power, still feel emotional pain and are still prey to all those human weaknesses that are independent of the ""shell"".

The movie and the television series both carefully overlook the sexuality of the main character, although there are indications that there may be something more than a business relationship developing between the Major and Batou in the first season of SAC. In the manga, though, which is intended for a more adult audience, the Major does have a boyfriend and also indulges her sexual inclinations elsewhere. It's definitely worth bearing this in mind when you judge the characters in the movie, which does not have the time to develop them nor the adult certificate it would need to do so. Despite being almost entirely robotic, these are still ""real"" people and their acceptance of mechanical forms and the compromises they have to make in return for the benefits they gain are a significant aspect of the story.

I would say that if there is a flaw in this movie it is that too much has to be compressed into too short a time. Things develop too fast and are too soon over, and explanations have to be passed by in order to get to the end of the story in time. It's not unusual for Japanese storytelling to be thin on explanations but in this case you really do wish you could spend more time with the characters before it's all over. If you find yourself hooked by the concepts of life with a cyber-brain but left wanting to explore more when the movie is over, do follow up with the original manga and the TV series and you won't regret it.",1139356800,9,3427,4.567479674796748

778521,5,6304083777,"When this film was released in theatres in the US, it was denounced by some critics for being ""too philosophical."" It's amazing how often that term comes up around great works of art. Socrates, Jesus, Ayn Rand... so many people denounced for being ""too philosophical."" Honestly.

Anyways, I am relatively unfamiliar with most Japanese animation, but I am a great fan of cyberpunk films and this one fits the ticket well. In the future, when the information age has grown to the level of cities and structural definitions of separation between machine and human are breaking down, a feminine cyborg is hunting down a mysterious hacker called the Puppet Master who's history and purpose remains completely unknown.

The animation here is really beautiful and contains magnificent imagery. One of the great things about going with animation as opposed to filming sets and the like is that every shadow, light, and body is completely controllable, even if it's just added in as an afterthought. Nothing in this film seems just ""added in,"" though, as everything from the city to the nudity is of symbolic import.

It's also clear that this film is yet another of the many various works that culminated inspired the Wachowski brothers. A lot of the imagery of this film is very much reminiscent of The Matrix (or, to put it more accurately, The Matrix is very reminiscent of this film).

It's not actually much on the action side of things (though it has it's moments), but it certainly is worth the watch, especially to see mostly the imagery and how the characters live and interact with it.

778522,5,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years.

Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"" and Huxley's ""Brave New World"", and later Orwell's ""1984"". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. ""2001"" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where ""2001"" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins.

Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain?

Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, ""Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences"".

Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinating dialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. ""A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.""

Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film. This is one of the few movies ever made that everyone should watch at least once.",1130976000,8,3306,5.003636363636364
778600,5,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is set in a future not that far from today, and some think that it is an accurate portrayal of the world that will come about in that time-frame.  It focuses on the idea of what will happen when technology becomes so powerful that humanity will fuse with it almost entirely.  The Internet is the technology used in Ghost in the Shell to show this in the best way.  When the Internet achieves such power, people start getting cybernetic brain implants to link their minds to it - thinking that it will make their life easier.  However, people always fail to realize that the more complex something becomes, the higher the chances that disorders will start to arise.  The Puppet Master - the so-called villain - is depicted as a type of disorder that arises from the vast sea of information created by the Internet.  Being aware of it's own existence, the Puppet Master can be called conscious or even alive, a valid point that it tries to make in this film.  And since it is the child born from the Internet, its goanna have access to everything linked to the Internet - meaning that it could hack into the minds of anyone who is connected.  A certain hack occurs that leaves a person with fake implanted memories.  But is it better to live a depressing reality or a happy and meaningful illusion?

Ghost in the Shell's two major protagonists are Kusanagi and Batou - both from an organization called Section 9, which deals with public security.  A film that is quite heavy in philosophy and somewhat mediocre in action, mixed with artificial intelligence and that dark, gloomy feeling - creating the perfect recipe and making it not only my favorite anime, but also my favorite motion picture.",1128729600,2,1712,4.635761589403973

I know of no better film to compare Dolby Digital 5.1, 5.1 EX, DTS 5.1, and DTS 6.1 ES soundtracks on your home theatre. The EX and ES tracks boast a sixth channel for Surround Back speakers (on 6.1 surround receivers), and the film utilizes all these channels to the greatest possible degree of realism, and musical immersion. The title sequence (music) and the Major's climactic battle with the tank sentry (sound effects placement) are scenes that will knock your socks off with a properly set up home installation. Also worth noting is that both Japanese and dubbed English tracks are presented in 5.1 and 6.1 formats.

(Be aware that Dolby 5.1 EX features a ""matrixed"" sixth channel, that is, it is encoded into the SL and SR channels; Dolby Digital EX receivers will decode the channel and play it through the ""SB"" speaker. DTS ES features the sixth channel as a separate channel (""Discrete"") and also matrixed into SL and SR (""Matrix"") for backward compatibility. Suitably equipped receivers will display the soundtrack ""flag"" information for both formats, and decode the best option appropriately.

Visually, it is brilliant, as everyone has noted, combining CGI with cell animation and some other stuff I forget.  It really is a great-looking animated film.  Anime purists may bash the dubbing, but it in fact quite good; it certainly isn't the unintentional bad comedy that many dubs are (e.g., Godzilla).  For normal humans, the dub does not detract from the film at all, and would simply be considered good voice acting.  The film has slam-bang action, an interesting premise, a convoluted plot, and an excellent soundtrack (though the Japanese song vocals *can* be grating to my American ears).  If nothing else, that means that it trumps 90% of the live-action action movies you've ever seen.

The film does have its weaknesses.  The plot is hard to follow, not so much because it is complicated per se, but because it throws alot of things at you at once right from the get-go.  And it certainly has what seems like gratuitous nudity (or *apparent* nudity: in most cases, she's actually wearing a skin-colored body suit, e.g. her ""thermoptic camoflage"" scenes.).  Sometimes the philosophical rambling seems to go nowhere, though in fairness it never gets as dumb or boring as the philosophical rambling in the ""Matrix"" movies.

She is partnered with a fresh recruit named Togusa whose cybernetic brain has just enough gray matter to make him `human'; Ichikawa, the oldest member, spends most of his time alone on the Net; and Batou, a blonde, surly tank serves as Kusanagi's right-hand-man and is completely cybernetic.

In an unidentified Asian metropolis, ribbons of silicon and concrete tie skyscrapers and corporate networks together. A shadow organization creates a program called Puppet-Master or Project 2501 for industrial espionage and intelligence manipulation. The Puppet-Master becomes sentient, however, and escapes his physical body by uploading his mind into the Internet. There he monitors Kusanagi's (Motoko) online activities and allows himself to be captured. She uplinks with him and is forced to confront the meaning of her own existence; what does it mean to be human? Does the presence of a ""ghost"" or soul constitute life, even if that soul is in a synthetic shell?

The cityscape of Ghost in the Shell is so detailed that, at times, it's as though acetate was laid over actual maps and traced. Skewed angles transform vertical highways into prisms. Lights fleck rippling water, reflections skate across panes of glass. The look of the film draws a razor-sharp line between upper and lower society, juxtaposing hard, silvery skyscrapers and high-tech gadgets against the grimy tones of urban existence. This cinematography is reminiscent of the movie that started cyber-punk, Blade-Runner. Lengthy utterances on the duality of human and machine existence are interspersed with loud, beautifully styled action sequences.

Ghost in the Shell is a cult classic among many, many anime fans, but to be honest, I'm not sure why. I've seen Ninja Scroll, Evangelion, El-Hazard, Princess Mononoke, Patlabor, and more - so I think I'm sufficiently experienced to say: Ghost in the Shell ain't all that. Even though the animation is incredible (even by today's standards), what this boils down to is a high tech animated cop drama.

The entire Ghost in the Shell world revolves around a cyber cop (the woman on the cover, Motoko Kusanagi) and her team of investigators (called Section 9) as they track down cyber-criminals and hackers. Aside from the glorious animation, that's not enough to keep me thrilled. The characters aren't as deep as I would have hoped, and they all seem a tad bit dull, in terms of personality.

Some of the people who rant and rave over GITS may have more experience with the Ghost in the Shell manga (on which this movie was based). Perhaps their love of Motoko is deeper than mine will ever be, and perhaps they understand the Ghost in the Shell universe better than I do. But the fact is, just watching this movie by itself won't do much to draw you into the world of Section 9.

However, the movie depends mostly on the voice of the Major, and Mimi Woods was (no offense) a terrible choice.  Motoko Kusanagi is practically a perfect cybernetic being, so one might think she'd have a beautiful, almost mystic voice to go with her looks and personality.  Woods, however, sounds unrefined...natural, but too simple and out-of-character.  If you close your eyes and try to picture the Major through Mimi Woods' voice, you don't.  You can't.  And everything she says loses its strength because the voice just can't deliver it with the thoughtful tone it needs...and since most of the insight revolves around her character, that leaves a big dent in the strength of the film's philosophical core.

If you hate all dubs and are strictly a ""subbed"" person, then enjoy; otherwise, be warned: with that dubbed voice, the Major's credibility only hangs on by its teeth.",1115337600,11,1385,4.785714285714286
778684,4,6304083777,"I've watched Ghost in the Shell several times and have never gotten bored with it. The heroine, the Major is an ususal character. She's a tough girl, whose body is entirely machine. Her life is all business. She solves crimes and saves Japan everyday and yet because this is a Japanese movie she's not happy. Although her brain and soul are still human there's something missing and when she's not kicking butt she goes into these marvelous long soliloquies about the nature of individuality and the state of mankind. Her huge partner, Batou who is also 90% cyborg acts as sort of a stand in for the audience. He's the one who breaks into her speeches and moodiness and he's the one who points out that being super strong with parts that can just be replaced with a quick trip to a hardware store is pretty cool. Batou is smart, just as tough as the Major and he's the character that the audience comes to care about the most.

Out of the blue comes a character named the Puppet Master who might be a hacker, or a virus or AI or something else who is extremely interested in the Major.  The final scenes are beautifully done. You have action, you have sacrifice, you have suffering and beautiful, dreamy music. Another reviewer compared Ghost to Blade Runner and that's a good comparison except the future depicted in Ghost is far more dark. There's no happy ending in Ghost. Innocents get hurt, the bad guys get away with it in part and the Major is required to make a decision that changes her life forever.

It's a gorgeous film. Even if you're one of those people who would never look at anime check this one out. It's a classic.",1114905600,4,1633,4.491582491582491
778685,5,6304083777,"I have seen this movie both on TV and on DVD, and it's still one of my favorite anime films ever. People keep conparing it to the Matrix series, but it's NOTHING like the Matrix. It's a sci-fi/mystery story instead of a crazy sci-fi saving man-kind form the obvious forces of ""evil"". Instead it deals with human psychology and with mystery. It follows the two main characters(the Major and Batu)as they try to hunt down a new hacker calling himself ""The puppet master"" who has been cyber-brain hacking cyborgs all over the place. The story is really good, and the art is incredible. Ghost in the Shell is one of those anime cult classics(much like Akira or Macross) that leaves you breathless everytime you see it.

The action scenes are very well done, and very smooth. The scenes where characters are talking(and let me tell ya, they talk a good amount of time) are informative to the plot and the background of the world these people live in. If you want jsut wild shoot 'em up action, then I would suggest something more like Akira. This film has a good amount of talking, and a good amount of action.

All in all, this is still one of the best films ever made(I like anime and live action films) that i've seen. On a scale of 1-10 it gets a 9.5(only because it was a little too short).

If you enjoy this movie, i'd check out Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. It's a good series that follows the exploits of the Major, Batu and everyone else at Public Securtiy Section 9. Great show, great movie.....great series in general. Check it out.",1113782400,4,1550,4.48936170212766

778730,1,6304083777,"I was really excited about Ghost In the Shell Special Edition.  I am a fan of the movie which covers similar ground as Blade Runner.  Unfortunately Manga, which a lot of fans refer to as Mangled got the rights to this title.

The Special Edition is much much better than their original release.  The menus are very well done keeping the green terminal like computer motif represented within the film, and makes effective use of the score as background music.  Too bad the content is where the disc starts to go downhill.

First, the transfer and audio well done, except that for some lame brained reason, they decided to replace the closing song.  This totally throws the flow of the ending off balace.  This is a big thing in my book.  Who do these people think they are, overriding the original song?  Do they think they have more artistic talent than the creators?  They also included only english credits, while this isn't anything big, they could have taken the extra step an made a multiangle disc like what disney did for Princess Mononoke.  These are pretty glaring considering this is supposed to be a ""Special Edition""

The new release comes with a few more extras and on a second disc.  There is the production report that was included in the first release of the DVD, but they did not include the Japanese audio track as they did with the original disc.  A new feature has been added showing the computer production techniques they used on the move, but this only has a Japanese language track.  This time around they also included a few more trailers, but are in one long single sequence showing each of the three trailers back to back.

The packaging is very nicely done.  The discs come in a tri-fold that is becoming more comon with dvd's these days.  That in itself comes in a clear plastic sleve with graphics printed on it.  If you own the original disc, you're just getting fancier packaging, a new extra, good menus, and multi-channel Japanese tracks (a big plus), but still with the messed up ending (a big minus).",1106524800,33,2036,4.618384401114207

Not so much politics (and they explain those confusing future terms so you know what they're talking about). The music is the worst part. It's kind of scary.

It's not as good as the Matrix (sci fi); nor is it as good as Shrek (animation). It is for anime geeks, which until I saw this movie, I thought I might be one. But for you anime geeks, can you honestly tell us this movie -- which most claim to be the standard in anime -- has better animation than the Incredibles? better effects than Spiderman 2? better story line than Terminator?

I DO LOVE THIS FILM. Years after it's release, I still find enjoyment in watching it.

This is a visually exciting, dream of a movie that brings the viewer into a world that does not exist .. as of yet. It is not about the 'psycho-babble' as one reviewer called it, or conveying ideas that are meant to re-shape the World. It is a beautiful and entertaining piece of work... illustrated to the finest degree.

Some things should not be over analyzed. I know it's in our nature to take things apart and see how they work, and what is in the depth of them.. but sometimes you have take things for what they are. In this case, it's art, animated, telling a story, for entertainment.

Sure there are ideas that are brought up, but mainly they are to help convey the meaning of what is happening. These 'Ghost' stories take place in a future world. It is really not that far off.. if you do your research. Like I said though.. sit back, be entertained..and aspire to your own greatness.

Anyway this film is does what should be done with animation. It does things that otherwise would not work with a live action film. This film is very heavy on the philosophical side so for some people they may find it extremely boring. To give this film anything less then 4 stars would be a crime just because of the sheer artistry, and the amount of time spent by these people making this project.",1099180800,6,814,4.582191780821918
778736,5,6304083777,"If you hear the word ""anime,"" or Japanese animation, and instantly think of popular shows like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Dragonball Z or Inuyasha, then it's high time to re-think those perceptions. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is japanese animation for adults, in terms of both content and thematic material.

Based on the original Japanese manga by Masamune Shirow and directed by Mamoru Oshii, ""Ghost in the Shell"" represents some of the best Japanese animation has to offer. Along with ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away,"" this film is one which truly showcases the creativity and artisitic potential of animation as a medium. Despite being almost 10 years old, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a movie which still resonates with audiences of today.

The movie centers around Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg police officer involved in some vary dangerous work. The story starts with a bang, almost literally, as the Major assaults a secret meeting by jumping off the top of a building and shooting through a window, then vanishing. Everything about this sequence -- the gorgeous animation, the high-octane action, the developing story -- sets the stage for what is to come.

The animation of ""Ghost in the Shell"" raised the bar and set the standard for future animated films. The animators somehow combine the violence of the story with an unparalleled beauty in the animation that still stands out today. True works of art are timeless, and that's just what ""Ghost in the Shell"" is: timeless.

Of course, much of the animation is used for the many action sequences in the movie, which are quite unforgettable. From heavy-hitting gun battles to a one-on-one fight with an invisible enemy, the action in ""Ghost in the Shell"" is breathtaking.

The story is surprisingly complex and engaging for a relatively short film. Involving government conspiracies, a talented hacker known as the Puppet Master, and some really excellent science-fiction concepts, ""Ghost in the Shell"" expresses some pretty deep themes about what being human means, what constitutes a human soul (or ""ghost""), and how we define ourselves as individuals. The ending is surprising and will keep you thinking.

Simply put, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is an animated film that sets a high bar for other animated films to achieve, on all fronts. From storytelling to animation to thematic material, it's just one of the best out there. Definitely not for kids, but well worth viewing for almost any adult.

This movie isn't rated, but it should get an R at the very least.  The only problem sith this movie is the overdone nudity.  There are two characters who go nude in this movie.  The first is a cyborge body, which is busted up for most of the movie, but you  can still see its breasts.  Yes, it's a ""female"" body.  The main character, also a girl, is naked on three diffferent occurences.  On the seccond you don't see anything though.  Technically, she is  wearing a body suit, but it does little more than hide her lower private parts, and is also skin colored.

778798,5,6304083777,"As far as the original goes...

If you liked Major Kusanagi's dark night of the stroll through the rain-swept back streets of Hong Kong, you're going to love Bataou's visit to the Far North. Japanese film makers are twenty years ahead of us in every category, and if it hadn't been for Iraq, this joyride would have won the gold palm at Cannes, hands down.

Only two films invite comparison, not counting the first GITS, of which this is a seamless continuation. One is Hayao Miyazaki's brilliant Cullinan of a movie, Spirited Away, which together with this one, sets the bar so high not even Pixar will reach it before 2020. The other is Blade Runner, oddly enough, which was as darkly epochal as either GITS, and apparently evocative as well.

The viewer wades waist deep through a soup of rich pop-Mahayana aphorisms, but I guess if my culture were over a thousand years old, I'd be shy about introducing a new idea into the conversation without playing it against received wisdom, too. It pays to pay attention, though. This is a film about Batou, and no film about Batou is complete without mentioning Motoko Kusanagi, who only has a bit role in this film (so to speak, pun intended). Relax. Batou and the viewer are in good hands.

With a plot so detailed it could make your head spin, Ghost In The Shell is a must-have for the serious anime collector.  Many have drawn parallels between Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix.

The imagery was nothing short of stunning. So I knew I had to see the original ""Ghost in the Shell"". I found myself enjoying this movie immensely but next time, I will set the movie to Japanese w/English subtitles. The english was kinda made the film cheesy. Nevertheless I thoroughly enjoyed watching Motoko Kusanagi (a/k/a The Major) and her companions who are also in the sequel search for the mysterious Puppet Master who is this superhacker. Yes this film is confusing at least for this manga newbie however I still enjoyed watching it and managed to keep track (somewhat) of what the characters were doing. I personally enjoyed the music to this movie. I wasn't bothered by the Japanese singing. My only one regret is not seeing this in the theater like I did with the sequel and see/hear this film surround sound. I also saw where ""The Matrix"" copped some of its ideas from which I find rather disappointing because it shows lack of inventiveness when you take something unique and original like what I saw in this movie and turn it into some overproduced, overhyped crudfest like ""The Matrix"". The bonus features on the dvd like the half-hour documentary of the making of ""Ghost in the Shell"" was cool. I found it fascinating to see how the film was put together and the amount of work the artists invested their time in.

My only complain is that the DVD is made for surround sound, so unless you're wired for it you might miss some of what is said by people off-screen.

Otherwise it is almost a perfect DVD, with lots of extras, including a 30 minute making-of-the-movie feature.  A must for fans of the manga and for people who wish to watch Ghost In The Shell 2!

Kenji Kawai's music fits the underlying philosophy of the movie so well that it becomes an integral part of it, making of the Anime an awesome visual and auditive experience.

I remember back in 1996.....already a full blown anime aficionado, I had followed the production of this film since the first Japanese press release and was eagerly awaiting its indefinate arrival on American shores.  Having read Masamune Shirow's graphic novel that inspired the film, this became the first anime title that I ever pre-ordered and counted the days upon its release.
But the movie wasn't what I had expected.  The entense action was toned down a bit.  The humor in the graphic novel was entirely non-existent in the film.  What was left were the deep philosophical ovetones.  And I commend Mamoru Oshii for making the risky decision to focus mainly on this aspect of the story.  The movie, in fact, was BETTER than I could have ever hoped.
The story seems simple even typical when described, but it's the underlining philosophical themes that make this film such a treasure.
Our protagonist is Motoko Kusanagi, an officer of a military division known as Section 9.  On the trail of a Notorious hacker dubbed The Puppet Master, Kusunagi begins to question her own consciousness or ""ghost"" as she unravels the case.
Deep in 'noir' territory, Ghost in the Shell is definately not for the viewer who likes to check their brain at the door.

For all its skyscrapers and other features, the city still has its crowded streets, banners, and open store fronts. They are part of the answer, functioning human communities in a man-made physical environment.
The animation was uniformly good throughout, but I found the script to have a choppy pace. There were long, leisurely canal rides between the chases and shooting, and long philosophical monologues. As long as the director chose an action movie for a vehicle, I would have preferred to see the basic questions acted out rather than spoken.

The Puppet Master is a master hacker who hacks into people's brains and uses them for his dirty work, presumably to carry out espionage or terrorism, leaving his puppets no memory of their infiltration.  One of his puppets keeps using a public computer to try to infiltrate the brain of his wife, who is divorcing him and wants custody of their child.  When he's picked up, he is told by Section 9 that his wife, child, and divorce are all false memories imprinted by the Puppet Master, causing further distress to the man when he is told the fake memories can't be erased.
However, there are two conflicts going on.  One is Kusanagi's mission to hunt down the Puppet Master.  The other and the one with a deeper meaning is the search for her identity within the scheme of a whole, or rather, something beyond her individual self, highlighted by her words taken from the Book of Corinthians:  ""For now we through a glass, darkly.""  This reflects an earlier statement when she says in observation of a victim of the Puppet Master, ""all data that exists is both fantasy and reality.  Whichever it is, the data a person collects in a lifetime is a tiny bit compared to the whole.""  A postmodernist flair is introduced when the Puppet Master says  ""While memories may as well be the same as fantasy, it is by these memories that mankind exists.""
The question thus is, is it possible for the soul to exist in a highly technological world, where special operatives have cyborg shells, metabolic control systems, ESP, and cyber-brains?
The search is also symbolized when she surfaces, and the animated image of her rising up to meet her reflection, representing her true self.  She wonders if she has a ghost, an animating soul or spirit.  In looking at the construction of her body in the opening credits, one sees that she's heavily mechanized, with an outer layer of flesh surrounding her.
Her attempt at defining the self begins with a unique face, voice, childhood memories, feelings for the future, and the set of mental processes producing a consciousness that is ""me.""  However, upon a discovery involving the Puppet Master, she further worries that what if there wasn't a real ""me,"" that ""I believe I exist based only on what my environment tells me. ... What if a computer brain can generate a ghost and harbor a soul?  On what basis then do I believe in myself?""  In other words, what if there is no higher power to connect to, bringing into mind the word ""religion,"" which means ""to reconnect to.""
The action sequences aren't extreme, ultraviolent, or gratuitous in the chase sequences, but are moderate, that is until the heavy artillery is brought out, at which point glass, metal, and rock starts to fly.  A very intelligent, thought-provoking, one-of-a-kind existential, soul-searching anime, with Kusanagi despite its cyborg dominance showing some human traits.",1078531200,95,3718,5.009740259740259
778842,3,6304083777,"Japanese animated films are unusual. A lot more effort goes into them than for conventional western animated films. The extras on this DVD illustrate this and show that the attention to detail included the fact that when bullets were fired they sparked when they hit metal but not other surfaces. The plots are also multi dimensional and the characters more realistic. (There is of course something strange suggesting that animated characters are realistic)
This is a science fiction story set in the near future in a strange city that from a distance looks like New York but up close looks like Bangcock or Hong Kong. In the future law enforcement officers are not entirely human. They are people who have had parts of their bodies reconstructed using mechanical parts like the old television series the six million dollar man. The central character is a cyborg who probably has some form of human brain but is constructed in the form of a 20 year old playboy centrefold. She is involved in tracking down a computer hacker who is able to plant false memories into people so that they become his unwilling agents.
The film is one that is perhaps more action packed than a Stevan Seagal move with well constructed car chases shoot outs and so on. However it contains meditations on the nature of human identity, a debate sparked by the villain who in changing peoples memories changes the nature of people. A good deal of the film is obviously taken from Blade Runner. The feel and atmospherics and some of the lines of the characters interrogating those who  have become the agents of the villain.
Perhaps more interestingly the film seems to be an inspiration for a number of ideas in the Matrix. The opening titles were clearly the basis for the visual portrayal of the matrix itself. Others have commented on how the main character of this film is a role model for Trinity.
In watching the film was is amazed by the skill in the animation. The street scapes, the movement of the people in the background, the use of focus to create the impression of depth and movement. All in all a considerable achievement if at the end of the day it is only a science fiction adventure film with a slightly hackneyed ending.",1075680000,13,2213,4.703608247422681
778843,5,6304083777,"Like many other reviews about Ghost In The Shell, I highly recommend this movie.  I have had this movie for quite a while, and what has compelled me to write a review is the recent innovations in technology...especially biomedical engineering.  Current research in neuroscience, Electoactive Polymers (plastic muscles), nano-technoloy, flexible electroluminescent panels (could make skin the new light bulb), and replicators (printers that make 3 dimensional objects out of plastics....now some are experimenting with live cultured human cells in hopes to build a new organ (they've already made an ear)) is the science fiction of this movie.
Ghost in the shell is a powerful movie for those who know what is possible in today's revolutionary merging of man and machine.  Our electrical signals generated in our brains and body are currently being deciphered as a code which is very similar to the 1s and 0s the computer uses you are working on right now.  Soon, with respect to historical timelines, our lives just might be parallel to that of this movie.
Stylistically this movie is sharp, interesting and familiar to most anime fans.  I first saw this movie over seven years ago and was amazed.  Now I occasionally view it and reflect on the technology around me, my colleagues (teachers and scientists), and my students.  Those students will be the scientists who make the subject matter in this movie a reality.

778844,5,6304083777,"Ghost in a Shell is first class Manga entertainment with a positively techno-orientated feel to boot. The world that has been assembled for this movie will blow your mind and at times it feels like you are watching a live action film. The plot is certainly going to bend your intelligence in more ways than one as you must come to grips with a Neo-Tokyo that is home to humans, half-human/half-robots, full robot humans and ghosts that are a type of robot that exist in human form - all before the story even begins. The artwork here is outstanding and many of the action sequences can only be seen in this animation as the cost of a CGI movie done this way would probably be double or more that of the whole Matrix trilogy.

The story revolved around a hacker that is hacking ghosts so that it can take control of the political and economic infrastructure of Neo-Tokyo. Ghosts, humans and half-human/half-robots set out to track the hacker down and along the way meet all sorts of conspiracies.

Yes, GIAS has probably influenced nearly every modern techno-orientated sci-fi movie and certainly movies like The Matrix and games like Metal Gear Solid can not deny where their roots came from.

Ghost in a Shell is not flawless and does end in a strange way that does not feel satisfying but you do not really care because what you are really watching here is the mega-fantasy and unbelievable animation that is on display.

Ghost in a Shell looks visually stunning but is heralded mostly for its techno-philosophical storyline that plays out as brain candy for computer enthusiasts. There are many creative moments to be had and it has heavily influenced many films such as The Matrix and lots of popular directors such as Quentin Tarentino.

The story revolves around cyborgs that are being hacked by the mysterious `Puppetmaster' to perform geo-political crimes. Cyborgs are sent out to track down and reveal the identity of the mystery hacker, with a shocking twist.

Ghost in a Shell is up there with the likes of Ninja Scroll, Akira and Vampire Hunter D but is the most divergent of the four. Those expecting lots of action, or even a long Manga, will be disappointed. Ghost in a Shell is surprisingly short and there is more than a fair share of dialogue, politics and techno-jargon to get everyone's neurons firing on all cylinders. That is not to say that the action is absent. It is there, and done well, but not as plentiful as the other top Manga, especially during the second half which is mostly cyborgs talking about neural-stimulating ideologies.

778875,5,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell takes the most common themes of Japanimation and shows it to you in a different spectrum, wide open solidly in one point of departure, from there its interpretation expands to everyone's own perception of the concept. The film essential story uncovers the elusive meaning of life by this new technological era, where everything can be assimilated by computer intelligence and political will to drain information and manipulate the spheres of power with all their generous killing for the sake of National Security, but the movie goes even further, convey modern science and method is the existentialistic question represented metaphorically by Motoko Kusanagi, in a multiplex compilation of uncertainty and doubt into the depths of artificiality. No cheap Matrix Reloaded philosophy, no free given action, just pure state of the art reflection and a resolution of the story line that is completely breathtaking, the result ends in the beginning of a new frontier of thoughts and memories.
Similar at first sight with Blade Runner, but far from it's point of view and treatment, Ghost in the Shell offers both emotion and sense, with smooth and much wise touches of intellectuality expressed in a level of animation that takes this genre and style to new boundaries. The Wachowski Brother (The Matrix trilogy), took from here their visual style and blended closely in flesh and blood, but always the main source stays magnificent, becoming the standard for new projects in this field; unprecedented.
Complex and beautiful, the film enters a world based on computerization of the human being, over specialization, and the unique characteristics of our personalities, the Ghost is the only thing that separates the organic real from absolute artificiality. And so, we are connected to a vast net, parallel to our own world, complex overwhelmingly by information, life multiplies responses and conducts improving it self by mechanic adjustments, man defines it's actions, but actions defines mankind, no proof of existence, where no modern science nor philosophy can't give an accurate explanation of life, a fragile state of lost conscience and greed for the objective in every aspect of life.
Project 2501, becomes aware of his existence, and so targets Kusanagi for his only and last attempt to blend himself and the Mayor for the organic achievement of breeding, perhaps to fully become touch by emotions and the tragic fate of dying someday, it really doesn't matter, all for the being, away from the synthetic is the goal, anything else is unsubstantial, beneath the remains, politically it ends in a draw, individually it ends in new possibilities with never before seen points of view, a completely new life, a new born child, this is the analogy of doubt becoming answer.
Mamoru Oshii directed this landmark movie, far surpassing any predecessor  (including the legendary Akira), in both animation and storyline. The graphic Japanimation style blended with computer effects, along with the smart script, created an unforgettable piece of science fiction, and most important, contributed the genre with an intellectual mood, elevating Japanimation to the highest level: an adult masterpiece. The film artistic and emotional level is magnified by an excellent original score by Kenji Kawai that perfectly matches every frame and adds more Insight and atmosphere to the story. Detail, architectural design, and colors contrasting the moods by expressing them into forms, pushes every scene to magnification and simple state of the visual manifestation, straight and solid.
A great DVD, where the transferring of every image is a pleasure to watch, the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is one of the best I've heard so far, and the Making of, illustrates clearly and in much detail the ways of such a magnificent film. This is one of those few pictures that grasp its theme and elegantly enhances it in the big screen for a mesmerizing ride. The Animatrix will be the next step in out breaking Japanimation and story line concerning science fiction, but still this are short films; no animated full length picture is at this level.",1069286400,,4142,5.200598802395209

778878,5,6304083777,"This is it, folks.  Accept no substitutes... well, at least not until you've seen this one.
Akira is a masterpiece, IMHO, but one targetted at the juvenile, which is no bad thing, really.  Ghost in the Shell is aimed fairly and squarely at the adult audience.  The characters are adults, the themes are adult, and the plot is very very adult.  Not in physical imagery, just in adult needs, angst and ponderings.  Also, the craft that went into the movie is adult...
Check out the instrumental scenes, for example the one that links the chase scene with the diving scene.  Not simply a work of art, nor a superb sensory experience, it's actually a peerless demonstration of animation expertise.  Take a pair of scissors and trim off the rest of the movie, and that particular two minute scene still warrants a viewing in itself.
Also, check out the scene with the Robocop-style battle tank. Never, but never have I seen such a dangerous looking machine.  You really wouldn't want to stumble across one of those on the way home from work.  Drop one of those on your foot, and you'd never walk again.  And that's before it fires any guns in your direction.
Check out the way that the editors depend on your intelligence to figure out what's going on.  No Hollywood-style spoon-feeding here.  No corny narrator: no artificial lines inserted into one of the characters mouths; no overt explanation at all.  Great.  A movie to get yourself involved in.  A movie that requires your brains as well as you eyes.
Buy the DVD.  Watch it.  Watch it a few more times.  Show your friends.  Think about it.  Oh, and then get Akira, and enjoy that too.  But first: Ghost in the Shell.

I have watched it three times now and don't have a clue why!?  First off let me say that I thought it was a good movie, and a great movie compared to a lot of other things I've seen.  However, I can't quite tell why people think this is so amazing.
Enough of me blabbering about my feelngs, you probably want to know why I didn't like it.  I am a big Fan on the storyline.  Secondly, I like a few metaphors in my movies and I need them to make me think.  However, I also don't like movies that have really really dense (and questionable)metaphors going on.  Akira made me question my life for a week, Evangelion made me think about my beliefs for even longer, Ghost in the shell made me think about the...dollars I spent on it.  It goes on about how it will make you question yourself and is a great metaphor for how technology is affecting your life, but frankly I didn't find that true.
I also don't like movies that don't end (The follwing statement should give you a pretty good idea about what I'm saying: ""Evangelion has an end; this doesn't"").  In my Mind, the whole thing is a prologue to ""something else"".  Although I've heard rumors about a series over in Japan I don't exactly think this was made with such a sequel in mind.  The ending has more to do with showing the viewers a omen of their lifes with technology to come and then sends them out in the world to change it.  That is a key element to the metaphorical storyline.  However, the story will leave you feeling very unsatisfied where they choose to end it.  If you haven't seen it, I'm warning you now.
Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let me end by saying that the animation was beautiful!!

From it's haunting, cultural soundtrack to the incredible visuals, to the intricate story - and it's more then worth your time to watch it if you have the patience and brain capacity to give it a chance. The story is slightly akin to the Matrix but not exactly. Entities have the ability to live on 'the net' as we all know it, a source of vast untapped potential which certain persons are hoping to exploit for their own ends. There are scenes in this anime which you will remember for quite some time, each of which are spectacles in their own right.

I watched it the second and third times, and I didn't get it. I read the manga (which had a completely different tone), then watched it again, and now I *sorta* get it. It's all very interesting, but it's hard to keep track of what the characters are actually *trying to do*. ""Okay, why is Kusanagi fighting this tank again?""
But, it's definitely a Good Film. What starts as a hunt for a malicious hacker, transforms into a journey to discover the nature of self.
Major Motoko Kusanagi, while the protagonist of the film, cannot fairly be called a hero. After the abovementioned tank has been destroyed, just when you're about to forget about it, the camera focuses on its dead pilot. Kusanagi and her partner have become completely jaded to the concept of death. This is an important trait of Kusanagi throughout the film. Without giving too much away, her decision at the end of the film is made entirely based on her lack of concern for the survival of her own identity.
Ghost in the Shell is a beautifully made movie, so that if you have trouble following the plot, the animation will probably be enough to keep you watching regardless.

What's even worse is that Shirow's characters are drawn and animated by other people! His great artistic style is not at all present here. If you have ever seen the ""Ghost in the Shell"" PlayStation game, you've seen Ghost in the Shell as animated by Masamune Shirow. That is what this film should have looked like.
Roger Ebert and James Cameron gave this film two thumbs up, but it's doubtful they read the source manga. If they did they would say the film is the equivalent of trying to grasp the meaning of the Bible in a 10 page synopsis.

There is much more. Conspiracies, cyborgs and artificial intelligence being more than the real thing... It is a world were only the Ghost - the indefinable element of human consciousness - exists to determine who is truly alive and who is purely a creation of the Net.

Personally, I think both of them are great and are based on totally different philosophical principles. Both of them are philosophical, seemingly influenced by different principles. The title ""ghost in the shell"" is very similar to ""ghost in the machine,"" which is said by some behavioristic philosopher who denies the existence of the mind. They thought that the mind is equal to the brain. They support the view that only what we can see is true. On the other hand, the matrix seems to be influenced by skepticism, which support the view that we never know whether things we see is true.

Is it just that you have no critical thinking abilities, or is it that your brains just for some reason shut off when presented with Japanese animation?  Regardless, the truth will out: this is a plodding (god knows how they got an eighty-minute film to plod, but there you are), pretentious, and terribly dull piece of work.
In many ways, Ghost in the Shell reminded me of The Matrix, another bad film that put style wholly over subtance, and deserves to be mercilessly ridiculed for its obvious and oh-so-shallow stabs at 'depth.'  I'm not saying that it would have been impossible to make a decent film built around the hoary old 'what does it mean to be human?' cliche this is emphatically not that film (that film would be Tezuka's Metropolis, which is polite enough to at least not beat you over the head with it).  And, regrettably, the shalowness of the philosophy is only matched by that of the characters, removing another element by which the film could have been made to appeal.  Do the action scenes succeed, then?  No.  They are dull and poorly paced, with no really feeling of excitement at any point.
To be fair, it's not all bad: some of the visuals are sort of decent, and the soundtrack is good (the ending theme is apparently by U2 and Brian Eno...whaddaya know about that?).

Even though I viewed this movie countless times, there are still new things I discover every time I see it, and more of the story I understand. Still the story seems somewhat confusing to me, especially with the extremely confusing ending. I recommend this movie to any anime fan whose looking for a serious movie, with a lot of mystery in it. There isn't too much fighting in it, but the few action sequences are marvelous. The graphics were stunning, with amazing enviorments, and beautifully textured characters.

This movie is full of action. The graphical detail is incredible, and every time you watch this movie, you will probably see something new. The only downside is that the character development is slightly weak. If you haven't read the manga, you initially might need help figuring out who is doing what, and why.
Motoko Kusanagi is a great heroine. She is motivated, introspective, and fearless.
Batou's character does a great job in the supporting role. Clearly he is not as philosophical as Motoko, but he knows where his heart is.

779106,1,6304083777,"There have been great existentialist works in the past, and there have been mediocre ones. Here's one way in which they can be distinguished - in the great works, the existential themes of the works are _never_ delivered literally by one of the characters, speaking in monotone, in a dialogue that is so contrived that it sounds like a series of monologues, addressed directly to the reader or viewer. That is not profundity. That is incompetence. That, however, is exactly what happens in Ghost in the Shell.
I have not read the book this was based on, and after seeing the film, I will never have any desire to. Even if I charitably grant the possibility that it was good, the film still failed entirely at presenting its content. There is no reason to care for anyone in this film. It supposedly poses some profound existential questions, but it does so in such a self-important way that I could almost hear the sound of the director patting himself on the back, congratulating himself for his own coolness. Since the time that could have been used for character development goes to use for these affected monologues (complete with quoted scripture), at the end of this film I felt no closer to its protagonists than I was at the beginning. I also felt no desire to get any closer to them, since they never serve as aught else than wooden mouthpieces for the director's profound existential questions (which, when treated in this manner, are not anywhere near as profound, or as original, or as worth pondering, as he would like to think).
The result is drabness and tedium. The screenplay is dry, the characters and their drama are so stilted and forced that they may as well not exist, the action scenes are boring (since there is no reason to be emotionally involved), and the film doesn't even have the saving grace of looking good. I vaguely remember one or two scenes when it was raining that I might have perhaps considered visually appreciable, but I have more recollections of scenes that induced headaches. And the nudity is nothing but gratuitous - bafflingly so, since Motoko Kusanagi is so unlike a real human that she is not only unattractive but vaguely repulsive.
There is one good line in the film, and even this line is only good relative to the rest of the screenplay. It is this: ""You're treated like other humans, so stop with the angst!"" There you go. Now you have no need to see this film any longer. This could have been a thought-provoking, beautiful, profound film that might have given Japanese animation some much-needed credibility in the arena of world cinema. Unfortunately, the director of Ghost in the Shell was blissfully unaware of what makes a film any of these things. The result is thoroughly unlikeable.",1026864000,19,2745,4.7447698744769875

It also carries the distinction of being the only movie I've seen that views the onset of technology as a good thing.

Especially, I love the fighting scene.  They fight on the water.  The shadow, lightening make up all the beautiful pictures.
 Ghost in the Shell was made in 1996.  I say, it wasn't quite successful from the money perspective in Japan, however, it was more successful in the US.
 I thought the story was too complicated.  One of the voice actors said ""you should see this movie from your heart"" or something.  I think that is very right.  I tried to understand what was going on there, but it was just too complicated; I guess I need the booklet to read the story setting etc.  I was thinking ""why were Japanese government people in Chinese city (you can assume that city is probably in Hong Kong by the writings and houses etc)??""  Also, in some part, the main character says some phrase from the Christian Bible.  The voice was so low that I couldn't understand what she was saying.  Even if I could hear, I wouldn't know that was from the Bible.  I think if you have some knowledge about the Bible, you might be able to see something in the story other can't see.

 The theme music was made base on Shinto music.  Shinto is the Japanese religion, basically believe in spirit everywhere.  However, it is more emersed in people's daily lives.  So that, most of the people don't know they are practicing Shintoism.  Anyways, the music was very mysterious and I think it fits to the movie very well.

No, ghost in the shell isn't really short ( 88 minutes ) but there isn't much of a story line beyond the world they live in. It's kind of one of those ""What does it mean to be human?"" plots.
For an action movie Ghost In The Shell has very little action. But every time there is an action scene it`s excellent beyond all reason.( The Major beats the monkey out of a guy while she's invisible on top of a roof ).
Ghost In The Shell is also really REALLY confusing. It's actually kind of like mission impossible. Mostly talk then it blows you away with unbalieveble fight scenes.
This movie is kind of for adults. Not because it's inapropriate but because it would bore the cheese out of little kids. It's (like I said earlier) very confusing. Lot's of stuff about section 9 section 3, ghost this, ghost that. Kids really wouldn't enjoy it.
Ghost in the shell is an overall high quality movie. It has top-notch animation (better than the manga which is very unusual. Well actually the manga doesn't have animation, it has drawings, but you know what I mean). And really good voice acting. But there isn't a lot of CG like everyone says there is. Not like Metropolis.
It would hard to give a rating to Ghost in the shell (By rating I mean like R and PG-13, not like 4 stars and 5 stars) because first of all it's a cartoon which changes things a bit, and it doesn't have a lot of innapropriate stuff but when there IS blood there's a lot of it. Of course there's a lot of nudity too but it's never in a sexual manner or without reason. Like when they make the robots they're obviously going to be ""without cloths"". By todays rating system it would most probably be rated from PG-13 to R. But I would say that a reasonably mature 12 years old could handle it.
Ghost In The Shell is messed up, but at the same time completely amazing. You should definitely check it out, but it's not for everybody.",1024963200,2,1990,4.352150537634409

779184,3,6304083777,"Back when anime was a struggling medium in the United States, there are said to be two movies that really started to open the minds and ears of stubborn US citizens who thought animation was just for children. The first is ""Akira"", and the second is ""Ghost in the Shell"". Both were based off of now legendary manga series; in the case of ""Ghost in the Shell"", it was based off the fantastic manga by Masamune Shirow. But the manga was so complex that they had to omit a lot from the manga and change quite a bit in order to make an anime movie out of the manga. The result has become a cult classic in the anime circles, but sadly that is all the movie is and will ever be.
The movie deals with Major Kotome Kusanagi, who lives in a futuristic world where cyber criminals are everywhere. One of the biggest crimes concerns ghost-hacking, which is the crime of tampering with someone's spirit, essentially. As the story progresses, Kusanagi must find a mysterious hacker known as the Puppet Master, and from there things take a very bizarre twist.
One of the biggest flaws of the movie is that it tries to condense a fair amount of the manga into the movie. For the most part it succeeds, but occasionally it gets so confusing that a second-viewing might be necessary. Another flaw is that a lot of the movie is talk. It might be argued that talking isn't bad because it makes sure the movie isn't a mindless action movie; but when there is too much talking, watching the movie can be the same as listening to books on tape. Luckily, this problem isn't present everywhere, but it can get quite bad when it is present.
Not necessarily a flaw but a personal annoyance is the amount of nudity in the film and how much of it isn't necessary. There was nudity in the manga, but not this much. One scene in particular is when Kusanagi, for absolutely no reason, strips her clothes to fight a large robotic tank. But it can hardly be called fan service because of the serious tone of the anime, and the nudity is more tasteful than tasteless.
Visually, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a marvel to look at. The tone of the movie is dead serious, and the animation has that same tone. There are no chibi-like moments here: no sweat drops, no incredibly large eyes, just realistic character models and interactions. The environments are breathtakingly detailed, and the character models are marvelous.
Soundwise, the dub is one of the better dubs on the market today. Dialogue never sounds flat or static, and the voice-actors sound like they are actually enjoying themselves. Don't go in expecting something like the horrible dubs for ""Ronin Warriors"" or ""Pilot Candidate""; ""Ghost in the Shell"" makes the anime readily available for its English-speaking audience, however limited it is.
All in all, ""Ghost in the Shell"" is a true anime classic but will never grow to be more than a cult classic. Some people will be turned off by the complex story; others will cringe in disgust at the choral music of the opening credits that is an aquired taste.

The Good:
GitS is a very thought provoking story centered on the importance of humanity. The story line really makes you think, so much so that it may take a couple watchings before you ""get it.""
The animation is nothing short of fantastic.  The music really sets a mood that, while not heart pounding by any means, does seem to get you exactly where the director wants you. It is a very well thought out story, and the care taken in making the animation and music fit that story is very evident.
Last note, this is a gate-way-drug for many anime fans for a reason. It's that good.
The Bad
It is short, a mere 82 minutes. It's one of the shortest ""feature-length films"" I've personally seen in a while.
The English dub is also lacking miserably.  In many places its half hearted and hokey.  Definitely go for the Japanese track with sub-titles.
This seems like it tries to be an action flick, but the battle scenes are few and far between. The music, while setting the mood the director seems to have wanted to set, just doesn't seem appropriate if you want the audiences heart pumping adrenaline.

The Bad: The movie loses a good chunk of the political intrigue and philosophy that the books contain.  Thus, the characters feel flat, and the story is often rushed and disjointed, as though the only things kepts intact were the action sequences.
The Ugly: The English dub features some very poor voice acting in spots, and some fairly major changes in dialogue.  The Japanese dub & subtitles however, are excellent.

779301,5,6304083777,"[NOTE: Considering that the storyline has been dealt with ad nausem, I'll try to highlight the more ""Philosophical"" points of the Movie]
Hailed as a piece with no equal, ""GitS"" provides the viewer with both a Visually Stimulating Picture coupled with a more Mentally Irritating Storyline that could possibly cause you to think of the Philosophy of Machines and Souls.
Probably drawing upon the question ""Do machines dream of electric Sheep?,"" the film raises the question about machines being sentinant lifeforms like us, with a soul, and rational thought. It also dwells into the ethics of technology, and how it quietly inflitrates society and in time, subvertly takes control. (The quote in the begining of the film highlights this point somewhat.)
The main chracter, Major Motoko Kusanagi, deals with questions concerning her body. She is nothing more than a Cyborg Body with very few of her ""original"" bodyparts left from her previous body. She begins to doubt her existance, and even her limits, trying to find answers to her questions. But she does find some solace in the main ""villan"" in the film, which leads to a very intense debate that couldn't have been written finer by a Professor at some Ivy League College in Philosophy.
This film provides something for everyone; Girls with Guns, Intense Action Scences, and for the Academics, questions concerning Machines and Souls, Ethics of Technology, and I think a debate on Evolution. In fact, some Professors use this film (And others) for their classes.
I suggest you try to watch both sides, as both seem to interact with each other. Who knows, perhaps you can learn something from a cartoon?",1008201600,2,1654,5.0181818181818185
779302,4,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is one of my favorite movies.  Whether anime or not.

779303,5,6304083777,"I want to give the bad review right away: I would have appreciated very much if they gave more movement to the animation, very stiff, at least let them wink! The dialogue is a little artificial, but I'm sure it was the translation, I hate dubbing, really do. So, some dialogues were thrown at the spectator in a very cold manner. Other thing, about the sound, probably for the dubbing also, it sounded very low and could have done a little bit more of work, and for the music, well, not my taste.
Anyway, it might seem I really dislike it, but quite the opposite. I can compare it to the other few anime I've seen, Akira, Mononoke Hime, and still I like this one more. Mainly for the smooth pace, uncompromised to show stupid action sequences. The plot reminded me a lot of Blade Runner (which I prefer), it deals with similar theme. The director probably saw to many art films, and that's good, let's change anime stories; it has a lot of potential, you can create a world from a scratch, but I can't still see how everybody is obsessed to making futuristic fantasies (for Ghost it's alright, its the whole point). Well, I'm drifting away... This movie reminded me to Apocalypse Now, althought is not nearly as good as it, it has the same dedication for the visuals, to create an hypnotizing mood.

779381,4,6304083777,"""Ghost In The Shell"" is the most engaging anime I have yet to be exposed to. I've also seen: ""Vampire Hunter D"", ""Macross Plus"" (loved it), ""Do You Remember Love"" (a fave), and...uh, does ""Robotech"", ""Transformers The Movie"", and ""Voltron"" (Golion/Dairugger XV) count? Okay, you get the picture -- I'm not exactly a die-hard anime fan yet, but I really do prefer Japanimation to any other kind of animation (seriously!); so here goes my review:
I'd heard so much good stuff about this film that I finally decided to rent it, along with 1998's ""Dark City"" (which was a good decision). The first time I watched it, I found myself resisting the urge to write down technical details like ""Section 6"", and ""Section 9"", and ""MOFA"" because they seemed to be important details to remember. The movie ran its course, and I felt a little (no, very!) disappointed. Then I decided to read what others had to say online, and they seemed to (for the most part), enjoy it. Many folks also suggested that viewers watch it at least twice. I decided to watch ""Dark City"" instead.
After watching ""Dark City"", I realized that one very cool movie released in 1999 borrowed heavily from both ""Ghost In The Shell"", and ""Dark City"", and that ground-breaking film was ""The Matrix"". From ""Ghost"", I feel that (visually) Trinity's character can be likened to Major Kusanagi (sexy, tough, short-haired), some of the combat scenes (pillars being blown away by machine-gun fire), EVEN, Trinity's deadly entrance (the same way the Major makes her deadly entrance). Lastly (and most obviously), the neck interface plugs, and the significance of the internet in this film seem to be elements borrowed for usage in ""The Matrix"". Even the open-ended ending reminds me of the way Neo seemed to look triumphantly on his situation with opened eyes...""Ghost In The Shell"" ends in very much the same way. (Perhaps both Neo and Trinity owe elements of their identities to Major Kusanagi, or maybe I'm stretching things a little to far...)
For those of you who haven't seen ""Dark City"" or ""Ghost In The Shell"", I suggest you see them both. All I will say about ""Dark City"" is, in that movie, things aren't as they seem, and like ""Ghost In The Shell"", the film deals with our perceptions of reality, of our memories, and our souls. Upon my second viewing of ""Ghost"", I realized just what everyone was talking about -- ""Ghost In The Shell"" is a super-cool anime, that raises the bar (thematically) for any anime that aspires to deal with realistic issues. I liked it much better the second time around...
Also, I enjoyed hearing the tough-guy vocal stylings of Lunk (Robotech) and Guld (Macross Plus) return in the form of Bateau in this film (Richard Epcar). His performance was the best in my opinion. Vocally, Major Kusanagi could sound very cold and flat, but at the same time, maybe this is the way a hardened cyborg would sound -- so you never know; it may not have been a case of bad acting.
Visually, this film is simply a masterpiece. I loved the exquisite art detail presented during the riverboat scene (when we got a chance to look at buildings within the city), and the lines the artists added during monitor screen scenes (tre-cool). In addition, the final battle scene between the Major and that tank is a must-see. Also, the arguably overdone nudity isn't nearly as distracting the second time around; it just serves to add a sense of realism. Same with the elaborately depicted ""offings"" of the government official in the first scene, and the guy in the car near the end.
So all in all, you've just read the review of an extremely satisfied viewer. Next up? You guessed it -- ""Ninja Scroll"".
Thanks for reading!

779454,3,6304083777,"Ghost In The Shell was an anime that I have been wanting to watch for a long time now. Have heard rave reviews from not only fellow friends and critics alike, I figured that I would like this. And concidering I have recently seen some of Mamoru Oshii's earlier works(the Patlabor movies were excellent. The second one was better than the first, in my opinion), I figured that there was no way I couldn't like this. So after seeing it, why do I feel just so, 'eh...' about the whole ""experience""?
First off, I guess I went into the movie blindly. I have never read the manga, nor did I have any previous knowledge when I watched the film. Unfortunatly, in the begining, I felt like was dropped into a world completely alien from my own. Things would happen seemingly like they would all the time in this universe, leaving me to scratch my head in a stupified mannor(this happens alot to me). As the story progress, it lets you in on more and more of what is going on. The only thing is, in the short span of this movie, tons of dialogue and information is thrown at you. You kind of have to be able to weed out the unnecessary things and pay attention to the more important plot keys. But ultimately, it becomes too confusing and sometimes boarders on incoherency.
One thing that would have helped the film maybe was more time to develop. Everything in this movie's 80 minute splendor seems just so rushed. In some cases, that's fine. Pi(another short, stylized film)was movie that did it perfectly(it also helped keep the pace of the movie frantic, which was what the director was trying to do). But everything here just seems like the budget wasn't big enough or the script had holes that were not filled by the time this film went into production. The end result is a mess of a movie that just has you staring at you screen wondering what just happened.
Despite that overly-long rant(it was a bit winded, don't you think?) there are still plenty of good points to this movie. The animation is high-caliber and is quite smooth. This movie deffently could hold its own visually on the big screen. The action is very well directed and creates a great tension when needed. Speaking of direction, Mamoru still does a great job of trying to bring this future to you in a very stylized way(if only the script were better). And as usually,  Kenji Kawaii's music fits the tone of the movie perfectly.
So in the end, what do you have? You have a short movie that is seemingly thin on plot but rich in underlying messages. As usual, I think for the most part, anime is still probably one of the best media to get that message accross(you know, aside from books). I know tons of you enjoyed this movie more than I did, and I think its far from being as over-blown like EVA was(that ""ending"" still doesn't sit well with me. Mainly because it wasn't an ending!), but it just didn't do it for me like Patlabor 2 did for me. Still, it's worth watching just to see if you like it. But you'd be wise to note that you might want to turn your thinking cap all the way up. As you are about to imbark on one of the most confusing rides of your life.",996710400,,3129,4.394827586206897

Recently two new movies (Jin Roh and Blood:the last vampire) have been made based on stories and screen plays by Oshiisan and he directed the live action film ""Avalon"" (not available in the US to my knowledge). Ghost in the shell is the last Anime film directed by Oshiisan and it stands as the apex of his directing ability. The story has many complex philosophical levels that deal with;(bear with me) the nature of individuality (Practicallity stressed over romance), the desire to find ""self"" (the origins of romance), the apathy created by human expansion, future-shock (the flood), and the nature of experiences (simultainious reality and fantasy). The animation, directing, and musical score are all masterfully blended into an experience that goes beyond simple movie watching and becomes a profound pyscological debate.  On top of that, the mundane plot (as opposed to the thematic progression) is ultra complex, dealing with politcal intrigue and high technology. The downside of the film is that appeals to a very select audience. long time japanese cinamatography  meathod was to use paced plots, in which the story progressess through several very slow moving and overly detailed scenes. American audiences will often find the movie slow, or feel that ""nothing is going on"". Their complaint is justified. To enjoy this film you have to ""argue"" with the screen, atempting to passively absorb the message will result in a very boring experience, broken by examples violent deaths and instances of nudity.

One area where this film completely blew my mind was the script.  Not only is the 'plot' extremely complex and interesting but there is also an extremely well thought out discussion of artificial intelligence.  This film is surprising cerebral, especially for a genre normally associated with little school girl superheroes.  This film is a great way to spend 115 minutes of your life.",994809600,,1244,4.857142857142857

I was debating whether to give this 2 or 3 stars, and ended up with 3 only because the Audio and Video quality was very good.  The plot is difficult to follow and I can hang with even the best technobabble filled plots.  In this case, the conmstant meaningless technobabble and plot were hard to follow leading to a poor experience.  It was if way too much of the movie was an 'inside joke' type of experience.  I did not gain anything pleasurable or meaningful from this 'Anime'.  Unless you are a proven Anime fan, I'd rent this DVD (at best).

779556,4,6304083777,"Widely popular on both sides of the Pacific, Ghost in the Shell was a revolutionary anime that set the standard in animation, and questioned the existence and fate of man. On the surface, you have a simple story; In the future, synthetic humans are developed with the same features as any normal human being, except for a real soul, referred to as a Ghost. Major Kusanagi, a cyborg herself, and her unit are to track down a terrorist known as the Puppet Master, who is able to hack into anyone's Ghost. The movie is incredibly realistic, and some of the animated scenes are simply breathtaking. The dubbing is good, but there's an unnecessary amount of cussing, probably to make things more realistic, or something....
The movie at some times crawls at a terribly slow pace, presenting lengthy showings of atmosphere, or talking about humans and existence. There is a LOT of talk about individualism and creation, but it's at a very simple level and gets boring fast. Spectacular action scenes break up the monotony; the battle against the miniature tank is absolutely the most realistic gunfight I've seen in anime, hands down. Unfortunately, the action scenes appear sporadically and only introduce and finish the film. The curse of the slow-moving plot is enough to bring an anime down to its knees, but Ghost in the Shell remains standing. Barely, though. The 30-minute ""making of"" feature after the movie is a great extra; how many VHS tapes do you see with extras? I appreciate this anime more every time I watch it. This was THE anime of 1995, and no anime fan should go without seeing it.",992995200,,1596,4.786231884057971
779557,5,6304083777,"Alright, there are like 235 reviews on this DVD alone,, and what's the point of writing another same review again?  Well, I recently got into watching and collecting animations and have put 'Ghost in the Shell' as Rank #1 of all the animations (and what are the other top ranked animations I have?  Mononoke Hime, Samurai X, Neon Evangelion Genesis [latter part], Blue Submarine No. 6,,get the idea?).  First time I saw it,, I simply decided to see it because of half naked woman-cyborg cover,, I was like in high school,, and didn't understand what was going on,,  and after 10 years,, with my friend's recommendation, I bought it and had to watch three times in a row to fully understand the story (it was more like I WANTED TO watch it twice,,).  I think it's sort of pointless of writing another review here since this animation is just perpect in everyway imaginable, but I will just state one point here and disppear.  The very first time I was watching it(well, second time), I had this feeling, feeling you get when you experience dejavu, or seeing certain places, situations, objects which bring you that strange feeling of being nostalgic,,  That was the feeling I experienced.  I think I was getting that feeling because of the content, which asks something that's highly philosophical, yet it pierces into and asks YOU the existence of very essence of human being/human nature,,,, and yourself-  And you can almost, almost begin to relate yourself to the story where the technology is being developed at such a high speed, yet not only human minds are not fully prepared to adjust to that rapid change, but also it's being dried of its emotion,,  we are living in this high tech society where things are getting much more convinient and life standard is getting better and better every day, yet there's this small part, small part of us in our sub/conciousness or mind,, asking what are we, who am I,,, it's more like a trade off where you have to sacrifice to fully appreciate yourself in the nature to live in this ever changing high tech society,,
After watching this animation, I just took off and drove aimlessly, putting on low volume music(lyric was about asking the very reason you are working so hard yet so blindly, for what and for whom?), all windows open, feeling cool breeze of early summer night, driving through the place I've never been to,,going under freeway bridge, over the low hills, into residential area,,and it was after 2 AM,,, I felt like I was that cyborg woman for awhile-",992390400,,2513,4.729977116704806

I have to admit that this is not one of my favorite anime,the plot wasn't very clear and I felt that I messed a lot of details just because I haven't read the manga. It interested me a lot because it was beautifully made and the backgrown was pretty similar to the backgrownds in AKIRA.I woulded give it 4 stars but I actually respect anime very much to concentrate just in what I like and forgetting about what is really important.

779693,3,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is a brilliant, highly sophisticated, philosophical film. A film that was made for and requires attentive, intelligent audiences not only because of the subject matter in deals with (artificial intelligence, what makes us human, what is ""life"", how do you define a human being, can computer programs develope ""souls"") but also because of its highly complex narrative structure (I had to view it several times to fully comprehend everything and I am not ashamed to admit it). If I were forced to compare it to live action SF movies I would choose ""2001"" or ""Pi"" (for the overall philosophical tone) and ""Strange Days"" (for narrative structure). As for the presentation on DVD, Manga Ent. has done a generally fine job (they co-produced this film so they probably had easy access to bonus materials). The making of ducumentary is great and provides many fascinating insights into the technical aspects of the film's production as well as on the anime industry in general. Sadly the original Japanese trailer is not on this disc. I also missed the original Japanese credits and the original song that played over them. For the Western release (in the so-called International Version of the film) a new song was composed by either U2 or members from U2 (I am not quite sure) and while it is not nearly as horrible as the new music Manga has put on FIST OF THE NORTH STAR TV, STREET FIGHTER 2 - THE MOVIE and the (UK versions) of the CYBER CITY OEDO OVAs it still lacks the overall ingenuity of Kenji Kawai's haunting score. This problem could have been easily solved by putting the alternate credits and music on an alternate video/audio track as seen on the now out-of-print DVD of AD VISION's BATTLE ANGEL. The original end credits and music can be found on the subtitled VHS release of the film. To further justify why I gave this disc only 3 stars: Manga Ent. actually managed to make spelling mistakes in the subtitles. We are now treated to pearls like: ""I SPAKE AS A CHILD"".

The animation of Ghost in the Shell is fantastic. In a few places the scenery looks more like it has been filmed rather than drawn, and even the characters have movements that are fluid and graceful, instead of jerky and robotic, like some animated movies can have.
The storyline of Ghost in the Shell is pretty straightforward, although the last 15 minutes or so was quite a surprise.  There's a lot of philosophy involved in the movie, mostly about what makes a person truly human, is it the ghost (a soul), or is it the fact we feel human.

I couldn't find anything to watch, and was  channel flicking, and came upon the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell. I removed my finger  from the remote as I watched the Major falling earthward, and from that moment forward, I  forgot all about my cold, I forgot about the misery I was in, heck - I probably forgot to blow  my running nose I was so completely entranced and involved in this movie!  Ghost in the Shell was a mindblowing visual experience like nothing I had ever seen before. It  was the very first Anime I had ever seen, other than commercial clips advertising some  Pokemon movie or other on TV, which I was definitely NOT interested in seeing.  I stared agape as scene after beautiful scene rolled past in fluid, beautiful, artistic splendor. I  listened as the background music and sound effects floated through my eardrums like perfectly  synchronized instruments seamlessly meshing with the visuals. The movie just kept getting better  and better, and by the time the ""going to work"" sequence was halfway through, I was in sheer  ecstasy.  I have always considered myself to be a connoisseur of cinema and have a DVD library of only  about 20 carefully selected movies out of thousands I have seen to date, but after seeing Ghost  in the Shell, everything I thought I knew about what makes a fine piece of cinema flew out the  window. This piece of sheer movie making artwork was done so fine, so flawlessly, so  perfectly, that nothing else in my library even comes close. Walt Disney? Don't make me laugh!  Nothing Disney ever saw in his most vivid dreams could match 1 perfectly  animated cel of Oshii's masterpiece.  Oh yeah, did I mention that this was an incredible movie? Well, I take that back. This is a superb,  exquisite, rapturous delight of a movie that not only takes my breath away every time I view it,  but has absolutely stunned everybody I have had the opportunity to show it to.  Ghost in the Shell was my own introduction to the world of Anime, and although I have since  found several other gems among the anime movies available, none of the anime I have yet  viewed has affected me in quite the way that Ghost did or been of quite the same caliber of  work.

To me, the tell tail sign of a good movie is whether I am still thinking about it the next day.  Ghost achieved this.  I love the idea of a consciousness spawned out of the net that strives to merge the best parts of human and computer intelligence.  The movie delves into the philosophy of being human without getting bogged down in it and becoming overly preachy.  This is by no means just an intellectual film.  The animation is absolutely breathtaking and, I would venture to say, the best I have seen to date.  The computer rendering really adds to the panoramic scenes, giving them sense of depth and distance that cell animation alone cannot achieve.
The world Ghost paints is also exciting.  We see snap shots of a politically complex and technologically exciting culture that leaves the viewer dying to know more.  My one qualm with the film is with the dubbing.  While it is certainly better than average, it runs into a common anime problem of sounding overly cheesy.  The words are right, but the tone of voice detracts from the drama in some of the scenes.

Granted, the manga was more than 200 pages and if it were made into a coherent movie it would have taken at least 5 hours of running time and a lot of effort, but I have to say the manga was better. The anime did not go into half the detail concerning the characters' backgrounds or even who they were. I had to watch the dub with subtitles on to catch the characters names. However, it was great to see it in color, because the manga only had 3 colored pages at each chapter. Yet the ending was anti-climatic since the original ending (it was quite different) built up a lot more suspense.  Still, it was pretty good considering the subtitles were different from the dub, meaning they didn't just take the dubbed translation and tack it on as the subtitles. So all in all, the DVD was pretty good, but if you have the time and the patience, get the manga because it is substatially better.",980899200,3,1108,4.326923076923077
779749,4,6304083777,"Ghost in the Shell is one of those movies that you must see more than once to really benefit from the complexities of the story.  But once you understand what is really going on, it is fairly easy to follow.  The acting is fairly decent but does suffer from some stiffness, this in part because of the translation from Japanese to English.  Thankfully it doesn't detract from the overall experience and mood of the film.

The coloring is great with a lot of contrast, paying special attention to the theme of the movie, science fiction.  Sadly the color scheme does become drab and a little boring, but that tends to be a staple in sci-fi animation.  What does shine in the film is the animation, although several years old, the animation is able to stand alone as some of the best that I have seen.

The DVD does offer several bonus features, highly uneventful.  ""The Making of `Ghost In The Shell'"" is unbearably boring.  It is presented in a cheap first year community college media project where many of the Japanese staff is interviewed.

Personally, I prefer titles like Nightmare Campus, Demon City Shinjuku and Detonator Orgun.  I purchased Ghost on DVD and it was OK.

779752,5,6304083777,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is a personal quest for identity eerily reflected off the gritty espionage plot in cyberpunk Hong Kong. GITS is unnerving, if nothing else. Not because of any particularly gory passages (which are fairly numerous), but because of the question the film asks: Is the ""I"" real, or is it an illusion? Am I the same person who I was a minute ago, or am I a simple copy with the original's memories?
Motoko Kusanagi, a cybernetic member of an elite strike team, is facing a personal dilemma: is she the same person she was before her body was destroyed and her personality was instilled in a cybernetic brain? She finds herself drawn to the mysterious entity known only as the Puppet Master, an individual with a bizarrely long list of crimes, from stock manipulation, to political machinations, to mind-hacking of innocent indivuduals. Lately he seems to have taken an interest in Motoko's area of operation, possessing a diplomat's enterpreneur. Foreign Relations department seems to be taking an unhealthy interest in the case, enough to secretly bring a thermoptically camouflaged (Predator-style) individual to a top-secret lab when a lone, confused cyborg is found wandering the streets. When it reveals its frightening identity and is stolen, Motoko sees her chance to discover her true nature. This takes our heroine from a car chase to a shoot-out with a huge tank, to the final moment of lucid revelation of the argument behind the nature of self-awareness and life.
In all honesty, I was so caught up with the puzzling plot that I barely noticed the artwork, although several CG scenes did capture my attention with their mastery. On the other hand, the sound scene is a bit barren: there are voices, and some music, but the sound effects are sparse.
The ""Making of GITS"" part seems amateurish to the extreme, and the interviews with the grizzled creators are not at all helpful or even interesting. At least it includes the translated version of the main theme.",980208000,,1988,4.902077151335312

Both of them start off the same and both of them end the same (sort of) but still it doesn't excuse the fact of what was done to the series. The magna contained humor and plot combined perfectly.  This tape while having some humor still can't compare to the magna. Some people say that since I'm into humorous anime I won't like any serious show.  This is not true.  I love Record of Lodoss war and that is serious.  This show just didn't have enough plot to get me into it.  They also tried to combine a pretty hefty magna into a 90 minute movie.  As such they had to sacrifice plot, comedy, and the funniest robots of all time.  If you want Ghost in the Shell go get the full issue magna from Dark Horse Comics this just isn't worth it. So unlike almost all the other reviewers I don't love this movie.  Sorry.",980121600,6,911,4.073033707865169
779754,3,6304083777,"I tried to get into GITS way back in 1999 and it just didn't wash with me. I thought it was because the material was perhaps above me and that this kind of sci-fi was outside of my comfort zone. Now, all this time later, I decided to revisit the movie hoping that my older, more refined judgement would let me see the movie in a different light. Nope. It's still as impenetrable as it always was.

In light of more recent sci-fi such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Transcendence, and even RobocCop when you think about it (all of which have a strong thematic connection), GITS does have some relevance and an intriguing idea in a world that is evolving digitally far, far quicker than it is evolving socially or ethically. The story has so much to offer in that regard, it's ripe for satire, commentary, and allegory but nothing becomes of it. The credits roll at the 78 minute mark leaving you feeling that you've been short-changed. There is a lot of potential in the set-up but it's mostly squandered on techno-babble and overwrought, pompous dialogue that is rife with exposition.

The movie was followed (and its universe expanded) by a sequel in 2004, an OVA, and a TV series, but this original venture feels more like a truncated TV pilot instead of a completely stand-alone movie. I am glad I gave the movie another go but the adoration mystifies me and the fans don't convince me.

It is totally different from general anime, such as Gundam, Tenchi, Eva or even Pokemon. what you have here is a very serious, groundbreaking film, worthy of international critical acclaim. As well, some people here say that the subject has been visited many times, i.e. robots having human intelligence, being able to understand emotion. WRONG. This movie was made starting in 1994, and the story was based on life (stored as computer information) travelling over the internet, and existing in the internet. This was an amazing story for a time where people were just beginning to pick up the internet.
The action sequences in this film may be few, but they are exceptional, including amazing visuals and real gunshot sounds. the story is very phylosophical, but not so that not every person could understand, but bordering on intelectualism and fantasy. The scenery is well-drawn, even though you see each for only a couple of moments. Overall, I would say that this is one of greatest animation films I have ever seen.

779831,3,6304083777,"When Ghost in the Shell was released, it was hailed as ""the future of anime.""  A fair claim, as more recent works blending drawn artwork and CG have demonstrated.  In this respect, it's an interesting piece of work.  Note that Macross Plus experimented with this visual technique 3 years earlier, but not to the extent of Ghost.
Unfortunately, Ghost in the Shell borrows heavily from ""Blade Runner"", ""The Terminator"", and even ""La Femme Nikita"" to creative an unoriginal storyline.  American movie fans will undoubtedly see the similarities here.  I don't think Mamoru Oshii was racking his brain to create something absolutely original from a script perspective.  He probably had a ""look"" in his head of how the film should have appeared, and filled in the narrative gaps to include as many special effects as possible.  Hardcore Ghost fans will undoubtedly disagree with me on this.
The anamorphic format is great, picture quality is great.  The sound quality is good, except it's too bad that there wasn't a DD5.1 Japanese audio track available on the disk.

779898,4,6304083777,"""Akira"" may have been confusing, but keep in mind that film's challenge of adapting 2,000 pages into 2 hours...right! And I still think that movie did remarkably well. Now we have the brainchild of Masamune  Shirow, the current cyberpunk manga genius adapted for the screen. And in  spite of the endless praise this film gets for its action and its skillful  blending of computer graphics and tradition cel animation, I have to say  that this film is lacking. Don't get me wrong, it is still my #2 favorite  anime of all time, and my #4 favorite sci-fi film of all time (""Blade  Runner,"" ""Akira,"" and ""2001"" being the first  three). However, in reading the comic, I have to say that the script-writer  for this film (even the original Japanese script, which always tends to be  better translated in subtitles than dubbed) made the mistake of taking a  series of 6 storylines, cutting 2 or 3 of them out, and cramming the rest,  even though not all of them were related. Elaboration: almost each issue of  the original manga had its own storyline, connected only by characters. Not  ALL of them had to do with the Puppet Master. However, cut a few  unnecessary stories out, add the Puppet Master in place of the badguy, and  blend it all in...you got the plot of the movie. In spite of that, the film  did a rather good job of adapting the original comic, but because of the  cramming of storylines, there is a sense of the film being rushed. Hell, it  doesn't even clock in at 90 minutes, which tends to be the animated film  standard. Now, with that aside, let's get to the real point. The movie  itself. It is fantastic! Without this film, ""The Matrix"" would  not exist, or it simply would not have been as good or as interesting,  because 90% of that movie (plot, stunts, special effects, etc...) came as a  result of the innovations of this movie. The story is very well thought out  and brilliantly executed. Because of its shortness, there is a sense of  something missing or being lost, but the action in the main gunfight scenes  make up for this. The animation is wonderful. The set designs are  remarkably well-crafted to recreate a Hong Kong-style city, and the  integration of computer-generated 3-D virtual cityscapes is exceedingly  well-done. The character designs and their personalities are given their  just attention, and while the unbelievably pale white skin of the  characters might blind the viewer, the use of transparent eye colors give  the cyborg populace of this film a soul all their own. That is the entire  point of the movie...the soul. The computer effects are wonderful, and the  music score by Kenji Kawai is soothing, ambient, eerie, and beautifully  compliments this shadowy virtual world. Of course, the Japanese dialogue is  better suited to the characters (especially since they really tend to go  all out and pour their souls into it...heh, souls again!), but the English  voice cast holds its own. Somehow the bland and almost monotone nature in  which Mimi Woods delivers her interpretation of the character of Major  Kusanagi compliments the quandary of the cybernetic femme fatale's ghost.  The voices of Bateau, Togusa, and Chief Aramaki are well-suited as well,  but the dark voice given by Abe Lasser to the Puppet Master is almost  frightening. Overall, this film is one of the best animated films to be  released in a long time, not to mention one of the highest ranking sci-fi  films of all time. Flaws and all aside, this is not to be missed!",962841600,32,3494,4.759599332220367
779899,5,6304083777,"WOW! I say again WOW! Masamune Shirow's masterpiece ""Ghost in the Shell"" was orginally manga yet it is even better as an anime. At first I was scepitical about this one, consider the anime ""Appleseed"",  yet never did I expect it to surpase the manga. Director Mamoru Oshi, whom  directed Patlabor and Patlabor 2, creates a future where what you see is  not always real.

The musical score like ""Patlabor 2"" is haunting  yet also tranquil, I highly recomend the soundtrack.

A.I. personalities known as ""ghosts"", (another name for soul) live and control mechanical  bodies who excel combat, can brake down alcohol, and have super  intelligence, not to mention own further, more advanced technology.  A team  of A.I- cyborgs must stop a powerful computer hacker who calls him self  ""The Puppet Master"" who is hacking into the minds of local people  and different cyborgs, giving them artificial memories, and causing them to  hallucinate-forcing them to do as he commands. 
His whole mission is to  merge into the life of one cyborg; Kusanagi Motoko, who is more advanced,  and acts like a human- meanwhile trying to discover who she really is and  how she wants to be treated-like a human, or a machine. Love and emotions  are something that these cyborgs tend to forget about, which is sometimes  considered a flaw, but romance is definitely what's NOT on these soldier's  mind.  Durring the climax with the puppeteer, Kusanagi discovers that it  is not just herself that she doubts at time, but the technology she is  built with. She is told my the Puppet Master when he enters her mind, that  they are more a like than she really thinks, and if they merge, they will  be the most powerful cyborg there is. Kusanagi is tempted, but stands her  ground inside of her mind and refuses his offer.
From a former  encounter with a man's power tank, Kusanagi's old body was left as nothing  but a shattered wreck that was beyond repair. She regains life, however,  now inside the body of a young child and then sets off searching for the  right path in which to lead her to a new destiny.

Everything is extremely fluid  and detailed. This film uses an interesting mix of both computer generated  animation and traditional cell animation. The result is a visual style that  is far superior to anything Disney has put out so far.  Kusanagi's tour of  the city examplifies what i'm trying to say guite well.  The plot is top  notch.  Though some have acussed it of being a bit to phlisopical, I belive  those statments are just to unfounded. The plot is very deep.

This is an anime so there is some great  action in it.  My favorite scenes are battle with the tank and the chase  scene involving the ghost half human.  The chararcters are also excellent.  Kusangi is one of the most interesting women in anime. Baeto is also a  great character.  He plays the voice of sanity in an insane world.  All  and all this is excellent anime for mature audiences.

Ghost in the Shell is very unusuall work, it is much deeper and thought-provoking than most of the titles you can find  on the shelf.  I also personally believe that the subject matter of Ghost  in the Shell is very accurate interpretation of what future will look like.  I am very sure that technology will reach a peak where it will be able to  blend human species and machines into one being.  I think that evidence of  the progress can be seen in all of the complex robots and synthetic organs  that scientists are working on these days.
  Anyway, I greatly  enjoyed watching the story unfold with all of its twists and turns. The  plot was great and phylosophical conversations between characters were  touching.  The only drawback of Ghost in the Shell would be in its end. The  story did not reach its climax and left it as a loose end almost like in  Ninja Scroll.  On the other hand, life is a loose end.

The world is becoming more & more computerized, and people  can communicate every in any situation, just by patching in to the  ""net"". The police and the special agents have superior body  functions, and some are practicly Cyborgs.
The story line is complex, and  very out-studied. A hacker is terrorising the city (Tokyo), and his nick  name is ""puppet master"".  The rest you will see for your self.
The colors and the art-work are all extra-ordinary, and just stunning.
MY OPINION: The longer you see, the longer you get infiltrated in the  story. And by the end you're just gasping for air, and your sences are all  on top.  After a while in the movie you have all forgotten that it is  animated, and you just live the movie with your heart. To compare this  movie with Matrix may not be a wrong judgement but I think this is the  original, and it is a stand-alone and should not be compared with any  movie. This anime-film makes you wonder for days, and you forget the world  you really live in. And the more you watch the movie, the more you love it.

780087,4,6304083777,"""Ghost in a shell"" Begins with a bang.  It begins with an image of a furturistic city. It zooms on a tall lumious building. On the top of the  building is Major Kusanagi, her hair blowing in the cool, night breeze. Major rises from her crouched postion into her full height. She  looks down upon the vast city. As cold as it is, Major removes all her of  her garments, and, gun in hand, leaps off the building. Major activates a  certain device, and becomes invisible. Major lands and materializes at the  window of very important person,(its revealed later). The V.I.P is  currently giving a speech, but Major decides to interup. She fires  multiples shots from her weapon, and the V.I.P wrenches. His upper body  explodes. Major leaps backwards and descends into the vast , furturistic  city, and vanishes.
 ""Ghost in a shell"", based on the manga  of the same name, revolves around a cyborg named Major Kusanagi. She gave  up most of her once human body parts for robotnic replacemets, but still  looks strikingly human(unlike the manga,in which she cleary resembles a  cyborg). Major completes her missions almost effortlessly, and is  incredably agile. But her a new mission may be her last. The malicous  ""Puppet Master"" does not kill his victims, but it is just as  worst. Instead, the ""Puppet Master"" alters its victims  minds,giving their memorys.  ""Puppet Master""'s frightening power  causes terror and confusion, but when even Major kusanagi bravely attemps  to stop the ""Puppet Master""  she too starts to question her own  self. Are you truly alive if you are a cyborg or a machine? Can you feel  true emotions?
 I will start with the following,""Ghost in a  shell"" is a thinking man's film, as it is though provoking, and is  fairly complicated. But even if you don't like to think,  This film is worth  seeing in my opinion simply for the visuals. Animation wise, Its one of, if  not the, well animated I have ever seen.  The animation blew me away. The  character designs looks excellent. The good artwork, attractive animation,  spellbounding frame rates(I swear, the character movements look almost  human), and toss in computer graphics and you've got... well...what do you  think? The way they combine Computer Graphics with their artwork is done  flawlessly. I never knew I could get so much enjoyment from watching  someone walk.
 The story for ""Ghost in Shell"" is a good  one, too. The ""Puppet Master"" has so much power, so powerful that  it pychologicily defeats Major. I do have a complaint, and it is about the  plot. Similar to ""Akira"" things seem to happen for no reason, and  despite the clever story, It all seems extremly confusing. This didn't  entirely suprise me much though. How good can a plot be if it is based on a  long running Comic book series. Either way, The plot is overly confusing  and seems conpressed. One other problem is the weak character  personalities. There was next to nothing character development, and all of  the characters personalities seemed lifeless. The Drab dubbing didn't help  much either.
 I suggest you see this film. Even if you don't like to  think,I guarentee you will like the breathtaking visuals. If you like  intellect in films, don't hesitate. There are worse animes you coulds rent,  plus this one has some cool battles to boot.",957225600,4,3302,4.845323741007194
780088,1,6304083777,"I know that most people will disagree, but I found this movie to be wholly disappointing. While the concept is good, albeit unoriginal, the payoff just is not there.  Comparing this movie to the Matrix is doing the Matrix  a grave injustice.  The technobabble in this anime, while necessary, often  times gets a bit excessive and hokey.  The segments of  ""characterization"" come off as shallow and unfulfilling.  Perhaps  my reason for disliking this so much is because I expected much more  action, of which there isn't that much(although the opening sequence is  beautiful).  The plot seems fragmented and disjointed at times, coming  together to form what I felt was a completely contrived conclusion.

But unlike Akira, every character has its own look (I dunno about you, but it got hard to tell between characters in  Akira). Sound is incredible in this anime. While sound usually never takes  a major role in Japanimation, Ghost in the Shell proves it does. There is  only one thing wrong with the movie...plot...now don't get me wrong, the  plot is by far one of the most intellectual and genius plots you could ever  imagine, but few will only understand it if you have read the manga. I  unfortunately did not, so like Mission: Impossible (a movie you had to see  like 3 times to understand everything) Ghost in the Shell has to be watched  more than once to let everything sink in. My 3rd time watching it, I  understood it and appreciated its genius and cleverness...This will be a  classic for generations along with Akira and Ninja Scroll. I highly  recommend this anime if you want action and well thought out plot. Both  subtitled and dubbed are excellent, I recommend both of them.",957052800,8,1097,4.569230769230769

780091,3,6304083777,"An extremely stylish film with great production values, but far too abridged in movie form.  It only runs 78 minutes (a far cry from the 115 minutes listed in the specifications here as of this review!), and the  story's depth and scope suffers quite obviously in its adaptation to this  media because of its relative brevity, equally obviously due to the expense  and effort involved in developing animation of this quality.  One gets the  unavoidable sense that there's an incredible story behind Ghost in the  Shell, easily worth several hours of storytelling, but that its surface is  only barely scratched in this film.  Events happen too quickly, too little  is explained beforehand or afterward, and the final credits start scrolling  before much of real substance has taken place and before the viewer knows  what's really happening.  I consider it really unfortunate; a true  injustice to the story's potential, but unfortunately nothing new to anime  adaptations (see Battle Angel Alita, for another, even better example).  Ultimately, readers of this review will want the answer to one basic  question: is it worth owning?  Sadly, in my view it isn't; while the  audience's glimpse of its beautiful, stylish cyberpunk world is not without  its rewards, it is ultimately too brief and disjointed to have continued  viewing value, especially for those who are not intimately familiar with  the original manga (comic book).  You may, quite reasonably, disagree and  enjoy this film for whatever it does bring to the table, in which case you  would find it worth its purchase price.  If, however, like me, you find  that unfinished potential animation masterpieces like Battle Angel Alita  and Lord of the Rings are more a source of mourning than enjoyment, you'd  do best to steer clear of buying this DVD, and simply rent it.",956188800,12,1834,5.060402684563758

780093,4,6304083777,"Maybe I'm just being really nitpicky, but I was really disappointed by the end credits on this DVD edition of Ghost in the Shell.  Yes, the end credit sequence.  I know how ridiculous that sounds.  This version of the film  ends with the credits of the English dub, which mistranslate a few of the  characters' names and scroll to a fast, upbeat European-sounding techno  piece which utterly spoils the creepy, ambiguous mood as the movie ends.  The English-subtitled VHS version, by contrast, used the original Japanese  end credits set to the original music by Kenji Kawai (a continuation of the  chanting theme that appears over the opening credits and the  ""Wandering the Streets"" sequence).  I know how crazy this all  must sound, but it really hurts the experience of this movie to hear the  beginning of Kawai's brilliant original music as that last shot of the city  fades away, then hear awful techno when the credits begin.  If Manga wants  to give us a Japanese audio track then they should make it a friggin'  Japanese audio track, giving us the original music and simulating the  experience of seeing this film in a Japanese movie theater.  (They should  also have given us a DD 5.1 Japanese audio track, but we can't have  everything.)

This is a highly intelligent story masqueraded by its anime facade, which has fooled many and thus typical reviews were always ""boring"", ""plotless"", ""what's the story about! ""...etc.
I have lost count of the number of times that I have watched and enjoyed this masterpiece. The DVD format offers a valuable insight into how this manga was made, thus allowing the audience an intimate glimpse of every major production stage and the efforts involved in realising GITS.
To fully enjoy this piece, one should watch it till full comprehension is attained, as the main enjoyment is derived from understanding the intelligence, rationale and storyline behind the film; being realistic in actuality and very much so philosophically... pretty much like the sciences behind ""Star Trek""; fictitious as of now, but who knows what the future may hold?
Amidst the main plot, my personal intrigue was derived from the discussion of what truly makes an entity a living one; of how it can understand its true existence and identity; of how we humans beings and 'artificial lifeforms' alike can reach within our inner selves to seek and reconcile with whom or what we truly are; of how we can affirm our intelligence sources despite not having seen our own brains or thinking components...Amongst the sea of seemingly obvious absurdity lies an intricate depth of scientific and philosophical substance.

780314,4,6304083777,"Definitely aimed at the mature audiences, Ghost in the Shell addresses some of the more profound questions that people ask everyday.
To be honest, first time around, I couldn't fully appreciate its thoughtful  content because I was overwhelmed by spectacular graphics and dramatic  action sequences.  However, during the second viewing I was able to go  beyond the pretty face and catch the glimpse of its soul, a profound tale  of a cyborg haunted by questions that some people choose to ask, or choose  to ignore, or worst, forget to ask.
Only aspect of Ghost in the Shell  that I thought lacking was the viewing time.  I really think it could have  been longer to further develop the plot and deal with barrage of questions  it poses on the audience.
If you happen to enjoy this Anime, I also  recommend Patlabor 2, by the director of Ghost in the Shell, Mamoru Oshii,  which I think is more refined one of the two.",945907200,8,918,4.633540372670807

And the sound is phuckin awesome. And  the story, if you like The Matrix, you would LOVE the story. At some level  the story is even more intriguing than the Matrix.

Hailed as a classic the film concentrates on the work of Motoko Kunasagi who is connected to the shadow organisation  that deals with cyborgenic theft and diplomatic problems. This might make  the film sound dull,however there is enough guns, action, bloodshed and  cyborgs to keep the average manga fan happy. The film reveals its depth by  introducing the concept of sentient beings that are created out of computer  files. This is where the film derives its title as a ghost is that part of  the human soul that remains when the cybergenic  implants and regeneration  takes place. The voice acting is good and the music perfectly suits the  mood of the film.

The contrast between the quiet and the chase is really effective here.  Matoko's nudity seems a bit gratuitous at  times, with the way the camera seems to linger, and sometimes they seem to  try to cram too much speech into too short of a time (they cram about a  page's worth of philosophy into a REALLY long sentence), but those are the  only complaints I could come up with.

The animation is brilliant, detailed and well crafted to lend the perfect futuristic feeling to the film. Montage scenes of the city lend to  the feeling of the film.  sound quality is also excellent, with  beautiful 5.1 channel dolby digital sound for the english tracks. if you  prefer subtitles, the japanese track is only 2 channel PCM, and looses  depth, but it is still very good.  finally, the film and it's message  come through clearly without dilluting the fun for someone who just wants  to watch an action packed film, while remaining something to think about in  an ever computerized world for those who choose to.  the only strange  part is motoko's constant nudity. although it isn't gratuitous, and is  necessary for some plot elements, it's still a little strange for an  american to see.  the only downer on the film is the limited character  development that takes place. i only really identified with motoko, not  with anyone else, and only then partially becuase of her aloof nature.  overall, this is a superb film for anime fans and film enthusiasts in  general. a must see.",944092800,5,1176,4.79

It's terrible in the dubbed version. Also, I really  wish more of a soundtrack is used... when it is used, it evokes a  wonderfully eerie feeling (check out the minimalistic music during the  scene where the puppet is getting beaten by the Major in the water... I  love that scene 'cause the music makes it so surrealistic). But despite a  few _minor_ shortcomings, this is still a fantastic film and it only  improves upon repeated viewings.

And I bet Bateau would agree.  Seriously though, I love this  movie.  The animation is so realistic it's astonishing.  Except for the  scenes with the old police chief, it's eye candy from start to finish.  The  story is mostly good, but the ending is unsatisfying.  Especially  considering that there hasn't been a sequel yet. (has there?)  I find the  car chase scene absolutely beautiful.  It's very hypnotic.  I also like the  visual of the tank being hit by Bateau's ""Big Gun"". Just about  every visual element of this movie is so realistic.  It's amazing.  I've  watched this movie at least a dozen times since I got it on DVD a week ago,  and I also saw it at Piper's Alley theatre in Chicago in 1995 when it first  came out.  Two of our friends that saw it with us fell asleep twenty  minutes into the film.  I can almost sympathize with them as most of the  movie is so sedate.  I wonder if that's the influence of the Shinto and  Buddhist religions in Japan.  As a piece of visual and sonic art, this film  is one of the best ever.

The  animation and CG compositing are exceptional, in strong competition with  Disney's latest, Tarzan, in the eye candy department.  The original  Japanese voices made you feel something that you simply won't get with  animes dubbed into English.  Towards the end when Batuo screamed out,  ""Motoko!!!"" and her response was hollow and weak.  You never get  those feelings portrayed by the American voice actors.  The story wasn't  all that gripping to me.  I was confused at many points and just when I  thought I understood something else would come up to confuse me again.  I  finally got it after watching a few more times.  I suppose my only qualms  were with the story which I felt was a bit weak at times.  It has a Blade  Runner-esque feel to it, but I never was too hot for that movie either.
