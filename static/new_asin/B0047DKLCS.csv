4284923,4,B0047DKLCS,Lives up to my expectation of a classic early atomic-age sci-fi monster flick.  The ending is lifted from the Odyssey.,1368057600,,118,4.9
4284924,5,B0047DKLCS,"Folks here keep talking about the different versions that are cut, missing the scene when the Cyclops pulls the spear from his ruined eye. And that this version from Warners is ""uncut"" because it HAS the scene in it. No one has mentioned the other four (at least) scenes that are generally edited from other versions.

In addition to the scene where the spear is pulled out of the eye, other commonly edited scenes include:

-The first scene where giant wildlife is encountered, when the giant hawk attacks the big rodent. Most versions (including TCM's) show the bird landing & the initial grab, then the standard shot of the shocked onlookers, then a shot of the bird covering the rodent with his body & that is it. In the uncut version, there are 3-4 close up & lingering shots of the hawk attacking & tearing apart the rodent as it kills it. If you look closely at edited copies (ahem...TCM's), after the bird lands on the rodent, the camera stays fixed on the man & woman, but you can see slight jumps where the violent scenes were edited out.

-In the scene in the cave when Lon Chaney shoots the Cyclops & the monster grabs for him & kills him, there are several super close-ups of the Cyclops roaring in pain that are missing in the edited versions (I guess the Powers That Be felt these close-ups were too shocking for children to comfortably watch).

-After the battle with the python, the Cyclops throws the snake down, and TCM's print goes immeditaly to the heroes walking to their tents. In the uncut version there is a nice close-up of a bloody-mouthed Cyclops roaring as he realizes that his sister has gone.

-In the much discussed scene with the spear in the eye, not only is the scene of the Cyclops pulling the spear OUT of the eye usually cut, but also the scene of the flaming spear ENTERING the eye as the hero hurls it into the monster's eye. A fairly hokey effect to be sure but still part of the uncut version (and surprising, not a scene anyone has mentioned, even though for me, this was the ""money shot"" of the entire film!). The hero tosses the spear & we see it actually fly into the Cyclops's eye and shatter it.

So, MY question, before I fork over the money, is this Warner's print ENTIRELY intact, with all the aforementioned scenes?  No one has mentioned any scene other than the one with the spear being pulled out of the eye so I was wondering. I would ASSUME that if Warners bothered to re-insert the ""spear removal"" scene, that means the rest of them are there too but folks may wanna check on their own before buying.

ADDENDUM (June 9, 2013): In case anyone is interested, I did end up purchasing this DVD and yes all of the aformentioned scenes are intact and the movie really is totally uncut! And great video quality too! Definitely recommended! Jeff",1335744000,16,2794,4.497041420118343
4284925,2,B0047DKLCS,"""The Cyclops"" is an early Bert I. Gordon ""giant thing gone wild"" movie that has some treats for lovers of the genre, but the DVD as executed is problematic. My copy was from the ""remastered edition,"" and as such appears to be complete. I can certainly vouch for the presence of the controversial ""spear removal"" scene in my copy, which is the main point of concern. That's good news; also good news is that barring a major restoration effort, the print looks as good as it is likely to ever look, though it's still an obviously cheap black and white science fiction film from the mid-1950s.

The bad news is that the DVD mastering is disastrous. Not only are there no extras (the one option on the menu lets you play the movie,) but the film is presented in one giant chapter, so note carefully where you are before you interrupt play. Oh, you can't do that, because the elapsed time function doesn't work either. (I just noted that I took a break as the shrieking tarantula came onscreen, and when I restarted the disc, fast forwarded appropriately.) The fair warning on the back of the case concerning this cheap DVD-R is that it may not play properly on all devices (including recorders,) which is true. It would play on my recorder, but didn't even want to load on another machine, so I suppose it's highly finicky as to what level of cooperation it will extend to what machines. Hope for the best, but don't plan on it.

The film itself is just over an hour long, and contains huge swaths of padding as the protagonists walk around. The story opens in Guayjorm, Mexico with a foursome in an ill-fated joint mission to find Susan Winter's (the beautiful Gloria Talbott) former fianc, Bruce, whose plane crashed in a remote part of Mexico three years ago, and to let perpetually grumpy Marty Melville (Lon Chaney, Jr.) look for uranium. You'll quickly be wondering the obvious: why were these two parties ever on the same expedition? There's also two other disposable male hero types along to prop up the action sequences.

Lon proves to be a very nervous flyer (to put it mildly) and forces the plane down into the kingdom of giant things, which enthuses him by being chock full of uranium. There are gaping plot holes in abundance, to wit: why is it implausible for Bruce to escape the jungle for three years, but they can walk out in a day? Don't think too much, because you might miss the gigantic rat versus hawk, newt versus lizard, or singing mutant tarantula dramatics. (I was particularly enticed by the giant iguana biopsy scene!)

So you're halfway through the film, and you've noted that there's no Cyclops. Are you watching the right movie? Yes, as it turns out. Susan walks around and psychically finds a piece of Bruce's plane, and subsequently Bruce's watch. Where's Bruce? (Can you not guess?) Nobody onscreen can figure it out, but the valley is teeming with both radiation and huge things, and suddenly a 25 foot tall Cyclops traps the four in a cave. He looks somehow familiar, but where do they know that giant unblinking eye from? (Technically I don't think of it as a Cyclops as much as a normal human grown to a ludicrous size and with a traumatic injury to one of its eyes.) The makeup and special effects are especially cheesy (even by Bert I. Gordon standards) but the dialogue is even worse. Putting the topper on it all is Lon's off-scale over-the-top performance, which is priceless. I will not reveal the dramatic conclusion, and although I personally don't really think an improvised flaming broom counts as much of a spear, Bert obviously disagreed.

If the DVD had been more satisfactory I would have given this three stars, but the pressing has too many flaws (notable on multiple players) to ignore. The film is vintage giant monsters-and-radiation nonsense, and has its enjoyable moments, but it's pretty slow and the monster is not especially evil, convincing, or compelling, making genuine enthusiasm difficult to muster.",1323993600,,3963,4.729377713458756
4284926,5,B0047DKLCS,"I have purchased this DVD, and I have watched it. The picture quality is far superior to any previous DVD issue, and far better than any VHS issue. Also, it is complete and uncut. The oft-discussed spear-pulling scene is intact and complete. I have included four ""View and Share Related Images"" so you can see for yourself.

4284927,3,B0047DKLCS,"Ok, I just bought The Cyclops in the end of March, 2011 and it did indeed have the scene restored. Now we can watch Bert I Gordon's ""masterpiece"" in all its glory!",1302566400,4,163,4.125
4284928,3,B0047DKLCS,"This is a fun film from early in Bert I. Gordon's career.  In it, you can see many of the elements that would later become B.I.G trademarks: giant people and animals, seat-of-the-pants special effects, and deadpan sincerity.  If you like cheesy monster movies from the 50s, this flick is a good bet.  The actors are attractive and competent, and it's fun to watch Lon Chaney, Jr. chew the scenery -- though it's actually the titular character who does the most scenery chewing.

The Cyclops, by the way, looks like a dry-run for the later Amazing Colossal Man/Beast make-up.  Half his face is melted and the other half distorted, with a huge eye.  It's a creepy if crude make-up.  There's a lot of pretty dodgy matte work here -- Bert got better at that as he went -- and I'm surprised that he didn't do much of it with forced perspective instead.  Still, for all its flaws, this film is a must have for collectors of B.I.G's work or 50s monster movie buffs.

In other reviews, there has been some controversy over whether the ""pull the stick out of the eye"" scene has been censored from this release.  Well, I just got my copy of the disc direct from Warner Archives today -- 4/7/2011 -- and I can say that I _saw_ that scene in this DVD.  So, unless there's more to the supposedly missing scene than the cyclops pulling out the stick and weeping for a moment, I'd say the current edition is intact/uncensored, folks.

Make sure you get this release and not previous ones.  The DVD quality is good -- a nice widescreen (anamorphic?) transfer -- and it played fine on my old Toshiba player (not a player/recorder).  I would have given it another star, but the SFX are pretty crude -- clearly from early in B.I.G.'s career.  What it lacks in polish, though, it makes up for in imagination and sincerity.

Enjoy!",1302134400,25,1810,4.540123456790123
4284929,2,B0047DKLCS,"Known for being a quasi sequel to The Amazing Colossal Man before War of the Colossal Beast, The Cyclops is more of a curiosity than a real gem of a horror film. I know, I know....if you grew up watching this film, you may have fond memories of this low budget flick, but it really isn't all that good. There in no sense arguing over how good this movie is, it's really about the release of this film to DVD. The print here released by Warner is cut by a few seconds when the Giant pulls the spear from his eye in agony, but the print is very clean(probably because it wasn't aired all the often). I personally enjoy the other two films I mentioned above much more than this one, but I grew up watching those two on horror hosted shows in the 60's on weekends.

In short , the print looks good, but slightly edited(the best part of the film!) there are no extras and it's expensive! you'll have to decide if this is something you must have in your collection, but after watching this one, I was only too happy to return it for a full refund because my copy froze once or twice. Enough reason for them to warrant a refund. I'm glad Warner and other companies are at least giving us a chance to own some of these obscure films, but please keep the price reasonable and make sure you use unedited prints!",1292284800,4,1301,4.245967741935484
4284930,5,B0047DKLCS,"For those interested, the Cyclops (1957) DVD-R has ""reappeared"" in the Warner Archive catalog.  I spoke with Warner Customer Service today and they informed me that ""the problems with the initial release have been corrected"".  I assume that means that the missing scene that caused such a stir has been added to the current copies being produced.  If this is true.....and I say ""if""...... I am impressed.....  Hats off to Warner!  If anyone can confirm that this is indeed ""fact"", please chime in.....  I love that The Cyclops has found a legitimate DVD release.  My only gripe is the format (DVD-R) which is a less stable medium than pressed DVDs.  That, and the ""giant"" price tag....

The scene cut is the spear in the Cyclop's eye aftermath where he pulls it out and cries.  A nifty scene that is in all prints I have seen, so why not here.  Shame on you Warner's.

4284956,5,B0047DKLCS,"I am a huge fan of 1950 sci-fi flicks.  Whenever I find one, I add it to my collection.  This one was a surprise in that I had never heard of it before this.  Loved the DVD cover art so I took a chance and bought it (despite it being DVD-R).  The story is not entirely original, more of an excuse to produce some low level FX with ordinary critters made to look gigantic.  The plot involves a woman (Gloria Talbott) trying to gain permission to search for her missing boyfriend lost somewhere in Mexico.  He's been missing for three years.  One wonders what took her so long to start a search, especially after he was presumed dead.  Not to be deterred, she hires a dubious pilot (Tom Drake) in love with strong drink.  Also among the searchers is a supposed old friend of the missing man, in love with her (James Craig), and it should be noted he has two good eyes.  And my favorite character, Marty Melville (Lon Chaney) as a financial backer of the mission with an eye on finding uranium.  As far as I'm concerned, this is Chaney's movie, he plays a fabulous sneak, a bit of a whiner, with only one thing on his mind, GREED.  As for the rest of the cast, eh, they're entirely forgettable.

Not bad for its type, about what you would expect from sci-fi flicks of that era, low on sense, high on melodrama.  I didn't get it expecting it to be great.  In that, I was not disappointed.  But I loved it anyway.  A good addition to the collection.",1405641600,,1444,4.288888888888889

Why did the plane's ID number change?

* ""Special Voice Effects by PAUL FREES"" *= The man that did a lot of the voices on the TV series ROCKY&BULLWINKLE.
The voice on the radio was his, a few animals, and the giant's growls... THAT is Paul Frees, the man of 1000 voices... look
it up! He has dubbed countless films, most un-credited, like Humphrey Bogardt's VOICE in the last film before Bogie died of
cancer.
Great flick from MY "" $1 Saturday Triple Feature Matinee"" in East Saint Louis.
You already know OF this movie if not ABOUT it.
WARNER ARCHIVES, finally, released an unedited ""CYCLOPS"" DVD, but, make sure you order the
""WARNER ARCHIVES"" version. Demand no less, and you'll get S0Oo much more! No censored ""gore"", here.
Creighton Chaney was Lon Chaney's son. His, silent film star, father paid for his son's ""handyman school""  edcation
But, Creighton Chaney WANTED to be a movie star, after all, Creighton was a tall [6'4""], handsome, man. He was in
more than a few '30s westerns, but his family-name----like The Barrymores!----reminded the masses of family FAME...
and, BLAME, for his later-year alcoholism. Not only did the studios insist he take the PRESTIGIOUS stage name of
""LON CHANEY, JUNIOR"", shortly, thereafter, ""Jr."" was dropped. Re-issued films his father did were referenced to as
""LON CHANEY, SENIOR"".
I read, somewhere, that Chaney's character in this movie was more-realistic as he was ACTUALLY drunk by the time
HIS scenes were put to film.
This is a five-star flick to those of us that love schlock, and, probably a 2.5 to Millennials. Baby-Boomer Platinum stuff!",1498694400,,1658,4.985559566787003
