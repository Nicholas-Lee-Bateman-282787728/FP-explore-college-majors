7688428,5,B01CQ75N6K,"I will be buying this one. I remember the original airing all those years ago and the times I cried for the characters and rejoiced for them. After that I bought the book and read it. I just finished watching the remake. They took a lot of dramatic license with the book. I am not sure even Mr. Haley would have recognized his book in the remake. If you can afford only one copy of this miniseries, get the original. There is more than enough drama without making something up. Although the very end, which is not in the book, is something that is believable.",1464912000,4,559,4.333333333333333
7688429,5,B01CQ75N6K,"I was twelve years old when this program first aired on TV and I remember being spellbound as I watched. The film's emotional impact affected me in ways that have lasted these last 40 years.

I purchased the DVD set as soon as it came out. However, I don't recall if the DVD presented the film in widescreen or ""letterbox"" format. Although the series was filmed for television at an aspect ratio of 4:3, the Blu-ray description says ""widescreen."" If the Blu-ray is presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio (for today's wide-screen TVs), then that means we'll lose some of the top and the bottom of the original full-frame image. Plus, in order to fill a 16:9 screen with a 4:3 image, it requires ""zooming in"" on the film's print, essentially enlarging its grainy effect, making the image on the screen appear ""snowy."" I hope the film was remastered for the Blu-ray release because there are techniques that can remove granularity in old films that were shot using ""standard"" film stock. For examples, see the hi-def versions of ""Grease"" or ""The Wizard of Oz."" A masterpiece like ""Roots"" deserves similar treatment. Imagine watching ""Roots"" where every detail in the frame is sharp and crisp.  How much more would the splendor of the open landscape of Africa be?  How much more horrifying would the scenes in the hull of the slave ship seem?

I never do this, give a product a rating before actually having it in my hands, but I do in this case because ""Roots,"" in any format, be it low-quality VHS, mid-quality DVD, or high-quality (but grainy) Blu-ray, deserves a 5-star rating based on the film alone.

I will update this review with pertinent and honest details regarding picture quality, as well as about the new and previously released featurettes, as soon as I've viewed the Blu-ray.",1460764800,8,1781,4.750809061488673
7688430,4,B01CQ75N6K,"I have always enjoyed this miniseries.  it tells a very important story that covers generations.  I have the dvd version I bought several years back and I enjoy watching it. this new blu ray should be just as good if not better! the picture quality will be top notch.  as for the new bonus features..they are not listed here but I did some searching and found out what the features are.  For the inquiring in mind as to what exactly the new features are for this 40th anniversary edition is, here ya go!

7688432,5,B01CQ75N6K,"I watched the original series when it screened on ABC back in 1977.  I'm glad it was released in Blu Ray because I've always enjoyed watching this and it is even better given the new picture and audio quality. The audio is clear, nothing fancy, but the picture is excellent - colors and details are done very well.

As for the series itself, it is very well done. Writing and acting is good and one really gets involved with the characters and rooting for the good guys to prevail.  I also read the book and while that's got a lot more detail to it, the series stayed pretty true to the book.",1503878400,10,592,4.267857142857143

7688434,4,B01CQ75N6K,"This is a great story. When I first saw it on ABC in the 70s, I thought it was a true history of the now disgraced and late Alex Haley. Although Haley plagiarized much of his account, the film is still worth seeing and enjoying.",1502582400,,228,4.088888888888889

7688436,5,B01CQ75N6K,"Classic must have for any DVD collector. Amongst the first blockbuster mini series of all time and the fact that the DVD set comes with a digital copy is a huge plus.  It's not a series that I watch frequently, in fact I haven't watched it in several years BUT it is a series I want available to my children, grandchildren and future generations to watch.  It's history, love it or not.",1495584000,,386,4.347222222222222

7688438,3,B01CQ75N6K,"The classic Alex Haley novel relating the story of his family is finally brought to blu-ray in fine fashion. With an amazing cast of actors, many who
were unknown at the time, and others who would continue to have successful careers in films and TV. Levar Burton plays the young Kunta Kinte
kidnapped from his home in The Gambia and whisked across the Atlantic by a ship captained by Ed Asner. Others who make an impression are
Cicely Tyson, Leslie Uggams, John Amos (as the adult Kunta), Lou Gusset, Jr. (Oscar winner), Vic Morrow (evil forman), Ben Vereen (as Chicken George), Sandy Duncan, Lorne Greene (Bonanza), Lloyd Bridges, George Stanford Brown, Renn Woods, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Welcome Back, Kotter), Scotsman Crothers, George Hamilton, Roxie Roker (The Jeffersons), Doug McClure, and even OJ Simpson. This classic mini-series had America riveted to its TVs in 1977. The picture quality is excellent. The only complaint is that the sequel, Roots, the Next Generations, was not included in the package as in the DVD edition.",1491004800,5,1036,5.064327485380117

7688444,5,B01CQ75N6K,"This was one of the first great, groundbreaking TV miniseries, back when I was a kid.  To finally have Roots on Blu-ray, after all these decades, is great! Because of its age, it is not the very best transfer you would hope for, but it clearly passes the test, after all these years. I would still recommend it, without reservation, despite how its age affects the transfer. Get it!",1488844800,7,382,4.536231884057971

I bought it to remind me of what those victims of slavery went through, years ago. It must have been a terrible way of life for them, for which the United States should hang its head in shame. For those who know little or nothing about slavery, this set is a good starting point in your learning.",1485302400,,466,4.247191011235955

7688466,5,B01CQ75N6K,Roots out on bluray excellent tv series its a 5 star for sure restored and uncut for the first time it is a great tv series fron 1977 the best.,1466726400,6,143,3.8
7688467,5,B01CQ75N6K,"So here goes:

I won't really delve into the content as this has been covered elsewhere on this forum and on the reviews of the previous releases. Only thing I can say about ROOTS is that even 40 years after it first aired, it is still very powerful; even more so when compared to the recently released and inferior  History channel remake.

The picture quality is fantastic; color accuracy is spot-on; image is super sharp; the aspect ratio is correct at 4:3 and the source material is clean (don't know if it was restored). Another thing people have not so far mentioned is that the episodes are presented as they originally aired. The version that has been available on home video ever since ABC reran the show in the fall of 1978 has been the 6 episode ""syndicated version"". Those six episodes were each two hours long.

This BD release includes all 8 episodes as originally broadcast: Eps 1and 2 are each 2hrs long; eps 3,4,5 are each 1hr; ep 6 is 2 hrs; ep7 is 1hr and the finale ep 8 is two hrs. It's nice to have all the original intros and end credit sequences as they were seen 40 years ago.

Most of the extra material has been ported from previous DVD releases. Among the new ones is ""The Cast Looks Back"" which is very short and pretty thin, but good to have, nonetheless. Roots: The American Story Continues"" is again thin and includes testimony of some notables (Sharpton, Whoopi Goldberg, Debbie Allen te al.) on how it affected them when the program first aired and on why the show is still important today especially in regards to recent events.

Unfortunately, the audio commentary by the cast and crew that was available in the previous DVD release is missing here. I am puzzled as to why it was not included as I found it to be one of the most fascinating and informative part of the extra features. For that reason alone I will be keeping my DVD version.",1466294400,14,1876,4.470760233918129
