I love listening to Jackie's voice and I don't usually like this type of singing or female sopranos of any kind.  Her tone, though, is soothing and healing to me - even haunting at times.  I enjoyed this DVD very much as I like seeing her perform as well as hearing her.  This girl's voice is getting richer and better as she matures.",1451865600,,450,4.309523809523809
7125728,5,B00W7AHCXE,"Heavenly!  Jackie's voice is sublime!  Even as she is growing up and getting older, her voice is ever more magical as she matures.  She is mesmerizing!  I watch this DVD over and over, and always notice little things that I missed before. Incidentally,  I was so fortunate to hear her in person at one of her concerts, and her voice---enchanting on the CD / DVD, is even more so in person!  Adding to the delight of her voice and songs, is the breath-taking venue where this DVD was made, which makes this album the epitome of pleasure!  Bravo, Jackie!  I love your sweet innocence.",1450742400,,582,4.528846153846154

7125761,4,B00W7AHCXE,"There is only one Jackie Evancho, and Awakening In Concert is her first PBS special in two years.
All Jackie fans will have it, but I hope others will also check it out.  One senses that Jackie worked
harder in the live show than with the CD, and there are two numbers not found on the CD: ""Say
Something,"" a duet with Cheyenne Jackson, and ""My Immortal,"" in which Jackie accompanies
herself on piano.

In the beginning of the DVD, Jackie leaves a gingerbread house and her siblings, running full
out at the tolling of a bell to the house where she changes, Cinderella-like, into Jackie Superstar,
appearing almost magically---like a rabbit out of a hat---before the crowd to begin her concert.
Her blue gown is exquisite, and the still-child Jackie looks at it with happy astonishment.
Jackie's face glistens with moisture from high humidity, and after the concert, as on cue, the
rains come.

Unfortunately, the shimmery golden vibrato one found with her Dream With Me recordings is
not as present here, and she seems to strain to get certain high notes out.  Predictably,
she does better with the pop songs, such as ""Memories,"" ""With or Without You,"" ""Je
T'Aime,"" and ""Take Me There,""  ""The Rains of Castamere,"" based upon the Game of
Thrones song, is the kind of dark song Jackie loves, and it was a music video.

The classical music lover in me finds special solace in the Chilean lullaby ""Dormi Jesu,""
a song at Jackie's upper range which is so daunting that almost no one sings it.  The
Rachmaninoff ""Vocalise,"" and the Caccini/Vavilov ""Ave Maria"" are also very demanding
classical numbers.  With ""Vocalise,"" we get two ballet dancers which I feel detracted
rather than added to the number.  In ""Your Love,"" by the great Ennio Morricone,
there is a tenderness coming from Jackie which just melted me.

""Open Fields of Grace"" and ""Made to Dream"" are, with ""Take Me There,"" original songs,
and they mostly succeed.  ""Made to Dream"" echoes earlier albums, such as ""Prelude
To A Dream"" and ""Dream With Me.""  In ""Awakening,"" Jackie is indeed waking up.  And
this is why the recording was staged at a vast, fully blossoming garden.

As I said, there is only one Jackie Evancho, and at her best she possesses one of the
most beautiful, exquisite, even transcendent voices known in the history of recorded
sound.  It is so penetrating, so true, even humble, that many people at Jackie concerts
find themselves in tears.

Awakening In Concert presents so many shining moments that you might be surprised
at how much you're taken by it.  I give her four stars, confident that my reservations
regarding her voice are diminishing with every new concert.  After all, Awakening In
Concert was recorded in August of 2014, and subsequent concertgoers feel that Jackie
has only improved to the point where she is now exceeding all expectations.  Awakening
In Concert is an indispensable signpost on the way to where Jackie is now.  Buy it!

This concert establishes her as a serious artist.  Her performances of Ave Maria, Vocalise and Dormi Jesu showcase her dexterity as a serious vocalist.  Her performance with Cheyenne Jackson on Say Something is perfect.  New original songs are a pleasant departure from her standard interpretations of established music.  This album is her stepping stone into the future.  Jackie now has a more mature voice but still has that Angelic quality we have all grown to know and love.  Every performance is perfect.  At her young age, there are few female vocalists that compare to her range and consistency.  Her performance of Your Love is surreal.  Her voice is clear and pure on every note.  She is the number one female vocalist of the century.  The beautiful outdoor setting at Longwood Gardens truly enhances the regal presentation of this concert.  In addition, Jackie demonstrates that she not only sings, but plays piano.  A performance of My Immortal is included as a bonus video.  A genuine surprise for the audience.  And, a separate video of Think Of Me is also included.",1435708800,2,1307,5.0327102803738315
7125773,5,B00W7AHCXE,Really enjoy this. Since I could not go in person. So happy to see a little of it. I have to shake my head at times in Roger to cope with this little girlie when she sings. Amazing.,1435708800,,181,3.789473684210526
7125774,5,B00W7AHCXE,Bought this as a gift for a relative that I introduced Jackie's music to and is now a devoted fan. They were unable to see the PBS special when it aired and now they will get the privilege of viewing it. (I'd already purchased my own copy from PBS). I'd recommend this DVD to everyone who loves great vocals.,1435622400,,308,4.237288135593221
7125775,5,B00W7AHCXE,"This is Jackie's third performance for PBS and she has never been better.  Her voice is richer, more mature.  Her song selection is diverse and fits her lush vocal abilities perfectly.  The Longwood Gardens setting is beautiful.  The fans are enthusiastic.  Jackie expresses a range of emotions, from fun-loving to serious and all points in between.  Her gowns are exquisite, she is energetic (watch the humorous opening sequence as Jackie races to make the show on time).  She performs numbers that she has never sung in public before, and nails every one of them; if that is not enough, she also sits at the piano and accompanies herself for one verse - again, for the first time in public.  All of this takes place with a new Music Director, Peter Kiesewalter, replacing her faithful and much-traveled conductor, John Mario di Constanza.  The instrumentals have been pared from full orchestra to just the essential pieces, allowing Jackie's incredible voice to carry the concert. It's like David Foster, her erstwhile producer said:  ""She is fearless.""  Fearless, fun, focused and fourteen years old.  Incredible!",1435536000,5,1116,5.104972375690608
7125776,5,B00W7AHCXE,"My local PBS station did not show this when it was first broadcast, so I was anxiously awaiting the DVD release. (dumb!) It was well worth the wait. I was already familiar with the song selections, having bought the Awakening CD when it first released. Jackie's duet with Cheyenne Jackson was a nice treat. Their voices blend very well together. :D Longview Gardens is a beautiful backdrop for Jackie's voice. The DVD contains a bonus featurette tour of the gardens that is very nice. :) Jackie's Vocalise is stunning! Her version of ""My Immortal"" is excellent, and shows - along with U2's ""With or Without You"" that Jackie can move outside the typical Classical Crossover fare and blow it away. :)",1435017600,5,698,4.776859504132231

7125778,5,B00W7AHCXE,"Jackie Evancho have blossom into a beautiful young lady. I am so speechless of her talent. No matter what age you are in your life, you can pursue dreams anytime and anywhere. The concert is incredible. I loved her CD, Awakening. This concert is very special. I hope Jackie never changes. If you have the heart of a child, this concert is definitely for you.",1434412800,,358,4.523076923076923

7125780,5,B00W7AHCXE,"A wonderful concert by a very talented young lady.
I thoroughly enjoyed this concert. The setting is stunningly beautiful. The songs are all great. Songs like"" The Rains of Castamere"" are hauntingly beautiful. The producers cleverly combine Jackie singing on stage and walking in the gardens in some songs, adds beauty to the song. My favorite songs are: Your love; With or without you;The Rains of Castamere and Memories. Jackie has one of the most beautiful voices of our time, perhaps even the best. I highly recommend this concert",1434240000,,534,5.01123595505618
7125781,5,B00W7AHCXE,"I rate this video highly not for its production values but for Jackie's versatility in her song selections, and the risks she takes artistically. Her classical selections, ""Ave Maria"", ""Dormi Jesu"", and ""Vocalise"" are technically VERY difficult. She interprets them extremely well and seems to be at her best when the going gets toughest. Case in point, her risky (but quite passable) piano opening to ""My Immortal"", which requires courage and nerves of steel to pull-off in front of an audience and cameras, given she does not play piano. Viewing camera pans of the audience, we see a largely older group that may not be that receptive to her song choices. I give her high marks for tackling songs across the stylistic spectrum. She is not stuck in one genre, but may suffer in popularity for breaking away from old expectations. Jackie's voice grows in depth by the year, and ranges from low-to-high notes effortlessly. Her personality is self-described as 'nice' and having 'a sense of humor'. Add to that courage and toughness to meet vocal challenges confidently. Her interplay during the video with singer Cheyenne Jackson is rather clunky and juvenile, but their duet ""Say Something"" shows her remarkable ability to not only harmonize but synchronize emotionally with her partner.",1433721600,3,1287,5.104265402843602
7125782,5,B00W7AHCXE,"She always surprizes, delights, bewitches, and ispires...never disappoints! 14 year old Jackie Evancho delivers another powerhouse performance featureing songs from her latest album, and showcasing one of the most beautiful voices on the planet! Awakening Live In Concert is, indeed, an awakening of this beauriful young talent as an artist. The concert was filmed at the stunning Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania...a setting nearly as beautiful (but not quite) as the voice of the young singer herself!

7125783,5,B00W7AHCXE,"What an amazing young talent. I'm still waiting for my copy to arrive but I've seen selections from this concert on Youtube and the setting is wonderful. the concert has most of the songs from the album also a couple not on the album. Jackie sing a great duet and plays a little piano to begin one song. Over the course of the songs Jackie displays the full range of her maturing voice. I appreciate the high notes that she can reach but as a male I'm more comfortable when she sings more in the lower register and only hit high notes once in awhile. I really like 'Memories', 'Open Fields of Grace', 'With or Without You', 'Rains of Castamere' 'My Immortal' and 'Say Something' with is the duet I mentioned earlier. The setting for the concert is beautiful - the concert is a vocal and visual treat.

June 15, 2015 - my copy came just a day or two after the above comment. The song My Immortal is a bonus song so don't panic when you don't see it during the regular performance. There is also a feature on Longwood Gardens which is very interesting and Jackie's official video Think of Me is also a bonus. My wife and I can hardly wait for Jackie's visit to Seattle this Fall - it will be our second time to see her live in concert. If you like Jackie and have not seen her YouTube cover 'Blank Space' with Nick Marzock, be sure to check it out.  I'm already looking forward to her musical release.",1433635200,5,1399,4.295454545454546
7125784,3,B00W7AHCXE,"I'll review both the cd and the new DVD of the same performance. I will start with the good and then move to the negative. Firstly, her voice has matured beautifully in the past 2 years and has developed strong top notes. The voice is more in focus now. She's beginning to sound like an adult which is still amazing for a 14 year old. If you're a fan and you want to follow how her voice has matured, this is a must have. But from an artistic perspective, it is complete failure. I think she's trying to corner the market on elevator music. The performance on the CD is so uninspired and boring I was shocked. There is almost no dramatic inflection. The beautiful sound just rolls out of her without a thought. As an opera lover and lover of the great pop singers like Patsy Kline, she is DOA. She is clearly more exciting on her earlier DVDs. The the quality of the music on her first DVD is much, much better than here. And she sings with urgency. Her DVD of awakening is better sung than the CD. The live performance helped to inspire her and that's common with opera singers. But the quality of the music can't be compensated for. It is deadly dull and the arrangements, and music, sound like muzak. This recording won't appeal to opera fans nor pop fans. But it may appeal to the over 70 crowd who are afraid that stimulating music may cause a heart attack. As musical art, this is a complete failure, but as vocalism from a 14 year old, it is impressive.",1433548800,5,1460,4.3127272727272725

7125787,5,B00W7AHCXE,"I see this as the next installment in a career of great promise.
Jackie's voice remains the main attraction.
The rubber band vocal chords of the 10 year old Evancho have been replaced by a more sustainable but equally impressive instrument of great beauty.
Her interpretation and nuance remain outstanding to my ears. Truly a musical delight.
I look forward to the next installment.",1433462400,6,382,4.984375
7125788,5,B00W7AHCXE,"I've owned this DVD now for several months; this seems from the menu to be exactly the same as the pledge drive ""gift"" made to those who donated.  I watch it frequently and never tire of seeing Jackie and marveling at how she's grown into such a beautiful young lady while continuing also to grow as an artist of the first rank.  Of course, I'm not an unbiased reviewer - I attended the filming of this PBS special at Longwood Gardens near Chester, Pennsylvania, back in August, 2014.  ( Though I have yet to discover myself amid the audience - darn! )  There were a number of amusing incidents that occurred at the time, possibly the most memorable of which was that a severe thunderstorm was approaching and Jackie and the director, musicians, stage crew, etc. were trying their best to complete the filming before it showed up!  Fortunately, it blew itself out before reaching us, resulting only in some light sprinkles about the time we were making our way back to our cars - just another manifestation of what we like to call ""the Jackie effect!""

Jackie's performance on that warm August evening was nothing short of magical, and it transfers nicely to this DVD.  She was joined briefly by Broadway stage and film star Cheyenne Jackson who serves as a sort of host for the production and accompanies her on one of the standouts, a duet of Say Something as well as in short interview-like clips while they enjoy the grounds of Longwood Gardens.  The only other performers ( besides the small accompanying orchestra and choir ) are a duo of ballet dancers who come off as probably the weakest part of the performance.  The century-old outdoor stage was beautifully decorated with greenery the gardens are justly famous for and looked stunning under the lighting.

In her musical selection Jackie continues much as she has from the beginning - indeed this performance is very reminiscent of that in Dream With Me in Concert, her first PBS special which is also available on DVD.  The songs range from the purely classical Vocalise of Sergei Rachmaninoff and classics like Ave Maria to more recent pop-inspired pieces like U2's With or Without You and my own favorite, Memories.  There are also two original songs here first performed by Jackie, Take Me There and Made to Dream, both upbeat and very much expressing her own cheery outlook.  Of course no Jackie Evancho performance would be complete without something from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera, her own personal Muse - in this case it's the show stopper Think of Me with it's magnificent ending high note!",1433289600,16,2578,4.766292134831461

The production quality on this album and the acoustic engineering are not quite what I would like, it sounds a little muddy in some areas and her diction is very soft rather than crisp, but still the overall listening experience is great due to her unique vocal characteristics.  Now as I'm writing this it's summer '18 and she's all grown up (18) and trying to find her way among thousands of other young female vocalists.  I hope she goes back to what she does best - ""Classical Crossover"", and forget modern pop and only very carefully do an occasional new original song.",1532044800,,678,4.443548387096774
