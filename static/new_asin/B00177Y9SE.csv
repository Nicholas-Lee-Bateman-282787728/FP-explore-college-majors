8265346,5,B00177Y9SE,"This physically and emotionally extremely violent movie is a deep meditation on an essential philosophical problem regarding mankind: man's free will, his freedom and liberty of action.
It is the story of a man who tries to master his sexually sadistic drive against women.
With harsh explicit shots the camera shows the uphill struggle against this obsession baked into the genes: `It is inside me. It is inside me'. How can I get rid of it?
This movie, with a sublime Jurgen Vogel in an extremely difficult role, is one of the greatest masterpieces of all time.
It is a must see for all those who want to know who we really are.",1248480000,6,630,4.584070796460177
8265347,4,B00177Y9SE,"I did not read anything about this film before purchasing it and, due to an interest in the German langauge, I generally buy most German language films which become available on DVD. I usually do not watch films with much or any violent content. The Free Will features several scenes of brutal assault and rape which are difficult to make it through. There are many people to whom I would never suggest they watch this film. It is a depiction of a serial rapist and the difficulties he encounters while attempting to cope with living life outside of a rehabilitation facility. Jurgen Vogel gives an intense performance in a very demanding role. The film-making is quite effective and the camera unflinchingly places us near the troubling events as they unfold. This film is worth seeing but is certainly not for everyone. There are moments of tenderness, redemption, agony, brutality, desperation and regret. I am interested to read any other reviews people might post here.",1215561600,6,974,4.945121951219512
