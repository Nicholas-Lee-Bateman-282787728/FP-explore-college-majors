1633154,4,B00005NFZP,"""Run Devil Run"" is the greatest McCartney album out, and is also my number one favorite in  collection of over 115 CDs and 50 music videos.  Well, if you enjoyed ""Run Devil Run,"" then you've got to try out this DVD.  Paul closes this 1-hour performance with six songs from the ""Run Devil Run"" LP, all of which are joyous rockers.  If you have the Cavern Club DVD,then this makes a very good companion, and if you don't, then I don't think you'll miss it too much when you have this.  Paul, on this DVD, rocks harder and jams louder than at the Cavern Club.  He also performs the title track, which is not featured on the Cavern Club DVD.  All in all, get this instead of the Cavern, and see Paul rock his heart out.  Once again, this is BETTER THAN THE CAVERN!
Paul gives a 5-star performance, but my rating goes down because of the B-52's ..., and the bonus features, which are too disgusting for words.  Get the DVD for McCartney, but stay away from the bonus footage.",1030492800,5,970,4.314917127071824
1633155,2,B00005NFZP,"In fact, the only good stuff on here is a couple of B52 songs. The rest is boring and low energy.",1011744000,2,97,3.6666666666666665
1633156,3,B00005NFZP,"I'll be honest, the ONLY reason I got this DVD is for Paul McCartney.  As a hardcore Macca fan, it was a must-have.  Paul performs six songs, which closes out the program (which runs just over an hour).  He appears in various spots earlier introducing guests.

The non-McCartney material okay.  There's some stand-up comedy from Ellen Degeneres and Margaret Cho.  Sarah McLachlan performs her song ""Angel"" as a Linda McCartney tribute.  The B-52's do a fairly entertaining 3 song set.  Chrissie Hynde does one tune, ""I'll Stand by You"".

The whole program was designed to raise awareness of PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.  It's a more than worthy cause.(EDIT 07/06: Since writing this review, I have come to realize that PETA is a group of extremists and I do not in anyway support their organization) The bonus features on this disc consist primarily of PETA-produced, celebrity hosted videos which are basically exposes of fur farms, puppy mills, and other businesses which torture animals.  I watched one- on fur farms- and it was just too hard to view, so I didn't look at the other ones.  As the DVD case warns, the videos contain very graphic and disturbing footage.

Getting back to McCartney, I think most people will be attracted to this release for his mini-concert.  If you don't have his ""Live at the Cavern Club"" DVD, buy it first.  That performance is with the same band and it is all McCartney-- simply the best Macca live video available.  But if you, like me, think that the ""Run Devil Run"" band was great- you'll want to pick this up too.  It is not hyperpole to say that the ""Run Devil Run"" band is McCartney's BEST group since 1969.  It took him 30 years, but he managed to put together a fantastic rock group, yes ROCK group.  David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd)on guitar and Ian Paice (of Deep Purple) on drums really help make this band soar.  Macca is in great voice as they tear through 6 tracks from the ""Run Devil Run"" album, including the title track (which is NOT performed on the ""Cavern Club"" DVD).  McCartney fumbles the lyrics to the second verse, but it just adds to the looseness of the performance.",1011052800,18,2148,4.659574468085107

7946850,2,B00005NFZP,"This event is badly organized, badly lit, badly edited.  The performances and stage presence of Paul McCartney & Crissy Hinde were the only redeeming values.",1376006400,,157,5.28
7946851,4,B00005NFZP,"The whole point of the show was to raise awareness of animal abuse in this country, and to those who were afraid to watch the features of foxes having electricity shot up their anuses, circus trainers whipping a lion, and a tiger being clubbed over the head so hard that the wood splits in two, and cows having nails pounded into their feet before their ""death march,"" all I can say is, ""The truth hurts, doesn't it?""

Some attack the reputation of the Hollywood stars who narrate the features that contain these appalling images. I applaud them for their honesty in making us aware of abuses that are occurring in industries which use animals for their profit.

The media often attacks PETA for extremist activities, but this DVD shows the positive things that the organization does. The fact is that even though ""The PETA Concert for Party Animals"" is now 13 years old, what we see is even more relevant today. Viewers should realize that this is more than just a Rock Concert.",1370995200,,979,4.6531791907514455
7946852,1,B00005NFZP,"DVD arrived OK, from a used dealer. Buy it used, don't send any more money to Peta. They are wackos who give money to ELF, the Earth Liberation Front. ELF sets fire to housing areas under construction, and plants nails in trees in such a way that lumberjacks can get blinded by the flying objects. Yet Peta tells us how gross it is to hurt animals. Yes it is, but is maiming humans OK? Pauly is here doing some songs, but it loses credibility with Pam Anderson and the B-52s. Pam is always pictured wearing leather and suede (animal products!) and the Bs once played a concert at a BARBEQUE! They took money to play while meat was being grilled right there, but justified it by saying they didn't eat any of it! Margaret Cho is here primarily to make anyone thinking of eating anything sick to their stomach; she's always vomit inducing. Chrissie Hynde has also strutted around in leather gear. This thing is OK for some of the music, but the cause is nothing but hypocrisy.",1294617600,,974,4.477528089887641
7946853,4,B00005NFZP,"The best thing in this concert is the B-52's, they sing their best songs, they stole the show.",1223683200,2,94,4.277777777777778
7946854,4,B00005NFZP,"A friend and I had long since wanted to to to CA and we finally did.  Being at this very formal event surrounded by people who love and care about animals was such a wonderful experience.  The ceremony was incredibly moving and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that there wasn't a single dry eye at the time.  The concert was after the ceremony and you were able to get right up close to the little stage.  While I was a bit disappointed that Paul only did his latest songs, he looked and sounded great, and everyone had a fabulous time.  Having some of this experience on film is extremely cool.  Those who say it's boring apparently weren't there.  It was more than just a concert.  It was about people being together and sharing a common cause.  Maybe it seemed boring because the mood of the event wasn't always 100% happy.  A lot of emotions were there that evening.",1107734400,5,870,4.415094339622642
7946855,4,B00005NFZP,"This is a great rock 'n' roll performance by Paul McCartney.  To close the 68 minute performance Paul plays six songs from his ""Run Devil Run"" album, including the title track (which is not seen in the Cavern Club DVD).  Also performing are the B-52s, Chrissie Hynde and Sarah McLachlan.  But here's a warning:  the music here rocks, but the bonus features are very upsetting.  Don't watch them.  But do watch Paul, for he will rock you to death.  Also recommended is the Paul McCartney Live at the Cavern Club DVD.",1094515200,5,515,4.593406593406593
