This DVD is twice the 45 min running time of Vol 2 or Vol 3.
These two stories were the two in the Festival of Family Classics 1971 series, which were two parters.
Appropriately grouped together on this DVD, they appeal not only to Rankin Bass fans, but also readers of the author Jules Verne, whose novels were the basis of both stories.
So you're actually getting not two, but four episodes.
Check out my detailed review for Volume 2, especially Australian buyers.",1212192000,2,530,4.589473684210526

I thought 20000 Leagues Under the Sea was particularly enjoyable.",1178928000,3,285,5.0638297872340425
