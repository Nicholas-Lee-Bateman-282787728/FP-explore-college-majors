Comments follow:
Fascinating overview of the Roman origins, Republic, Empire, Emperors, subjects, slaves, conquests, and  the conquered.
It skips over most of the conquests in the east,  with the exception of Judea and the failed campaign  against the Parthians. Many of the additions/segments with historians are of interest, some are distracting  and seem out of place.
The Greek influence on the Romans? Check elsewhere  for details as that's given scant mention via this  DVD.
It uses a lot of old movie footage to depict wars,  slavery, gladiators, etc., although there are  original scenes with production value and quite  a lot of modern day footage of the areas/topics  covered.
Unfortunately, some of the footage is used  several times for different aspects of history,  but only someone (like me) who focuses on  detail would be bothered by that technique.
The strengths of the show? The narration by  Peter Coyote and the exhaustive coverage of  some little-known or little-mentioned aspects  of Roman history, such as
o the nuances involved in the spread of chris- tianity which were in no small part a result of Roman subjugation of conquered territories combined with increasing proclivities towards enslaving/impoverishing said territories,
o Rome's persistent focus on shifting resources  to the very top of the empire with steadily  degrading adversity for the vast majority of its  subjects, over time,
o the causality/impetus behind the endorsement/ official establishment of christianity by Roman emperor Constantine.
Unfortunately, it gives scant mention to details  on paganism, sun worship, the mystic cults,  and other religions, for the most part.
Parts of the show could be used by christian  churches to promote christianity (and appear  to have been constructed with a christian  audience in mind). On the other hand, other  parts (especially the details on pre- and post- Constantinian advocacy of christianity)  would likely discomfort a christian audience ...",980553600,18,2398,5.4227642276422765

1239267,3,B00000JYWU,"I purchased Rome: Power & Glory in order to complement my university studies. The content was disappointing: very few maps, too much emphasis on legends rather than historical facts. Some very necessary explanations are  missing: surprising if you consider the participation of very good  University professors.  The image of the entire title is a mix of  contemporary ruin scenes -very well photographed-, sketches from an old  b&w movie, and some modestly produced scenes obviously to fill up. The  reconstructions of ancient monuments are well made, but the 12 Caesars  Biographies are barely one paragraph long: any general encyclopedia  contains much more information.  If you are looking for a basic overview of  Rome the title is OK, but if you are seeking for a more historical content  and analysis, to complement studies for instance, you will find it lacks  professionalism.  However the image quality is good and the photography of  the ruins is excellent. No caption or subtitles in other languages.",958953600,28,1012,5.24375

You can see some things clearly, but a lot are fuzzy, and most can't be seen at all. This series tries to make it all entertaining, but in the end, we're left with the fact that despite all the bad press, the Roman empire was very sucessful. I think we're no where near as advanced for our stab at civilization as they were. Still, this one ain't too bad ... sammy",1411862400,,509,4.3125

I would highly recommend this series to anyone who would like to know more about Ancient Rome. A novice will walk away from the program with a much firmer grasp on the sometimes convoluted history of the once great republic. A great introductory series that can also serve wonderfully as a friendly refresher. The talking heads that populate the series are warm and knowledgable, often providing the series with interesting insight.

Watch the series, then buy a couple books. Absorb everything.

I like that this DVD set actually starts at the beginning of Rome, before it was an empire, and doesn't get caught up in wasting tons of time by having reenactments with lengthy dialogue.  This documentary set is one of the best I've watched, and I've watched hundreds of documentaries on various topics.

It gets to the point, starts at the beginning and ends at the end of Roman history, always stays entertaining, and of course is heavily educational.  Extremely recommended buy for anyone interested in Roman history or general fans of documentaries.",1399075200,5,825,4.956521739130435

Peter Coyote is a good narrator, adding his talent to the material being offered. There is a fine line up of professionals that add their opinions and comments to the topics being discussed that add a dimension to the program.

1239284,4,B00000JYWU,"I particularly enjoyed this product, wether from movies or documentaries we all now about the heights of Rome. What I most like about this series is both the nuts & bolts of Rome's early development & the true nature of its decline which was a decline, not a fall. What I would most want to see from developers/producers next is how (much) of Rome's advanced knowledge of engineering was lost? We recognise that civilisations come & go, but we expect that the wealth of human knowledge continues to grow. This is not necessarily the case however & it would be interesting to know the How & Why?",1300579200,2,594,4.5607476635514015
1239285,5,B00000JYWU,"Enjoyable view of Roman development. Helped me reference the achievements of the Romans to modern politics, culture, and technology. Really made clear to me some parallels between ancient Roman and current conditions: a little frightening. Corporations have replaced the landed estates and the slaves have been replaced by illegal aliens and former middle class workers now working at temporary or menial jobs without futures or sustainability. The technical and management personnel, and small farms have been replaced by mechanized and automated conglomerates owned by the chemical, media, and financial companies. The workers no longer have any stake in what they do. The military is made up more and more of non US born personnel, almost like mercenaries. What we have is just a Pax Temporum and probably very short.
The failure of the Roman Empire was the inequity in wealth and power of the classes compared to the opportunities of the Republic and the inability of the middle class and lower class to carry the burden of the empire. Is chaos and instability in our immediate future? Look at our farming communities now. They are now full of poor people. It had been the ""heartland"", financially and spiritually of our country. It is now BY Wall Street, the corporations, the media; FOR Wall Street, the corporations, and the media. The ""people"" no longer matter. Are we all going to new dark ages?
Could have been a little more organized to be used as a really good learning tool. The included time lines could have been much more useful by relating specifically to each volume. This could be fixed without any re-shooting.",1297987200,4,1630,5.018450184501845
1239286,5,B00000JYWU,"I do not consider myself an ""expert"" on Roman history, but I've studied enough about the History of Rome, to know that I understand a hell of a lot more than the average person who's only been acquainted with it. This documentary is great for anyone who wants to own their own library of information on the subject. While there is far too much history to cover the entire lifespan of Rome in huge detail, and within the time frame of 6 - 1 hour episodes, this documentary is one I strongly recommend. It does a great job of giving anyone interested in Roman History an overview; from it's beginnings as an Etruscan Monarchy, to it's founding as a Republic, to an Empire under the Ceasars, to it's fall. However it also hits on particular subjects in a way that is interesting, even for one like myself who is well read on the overall topic. I was not at all disappointed in this film.

Even though I was familiar with most of the material, I enjoyed watching it come to life beyond the pages of a book. I recommend this film for both those new to the subject, as well as those who are somewhat advanced in their studies, even if it only serves as a visual depiction of what they already know.

The fall of Rome seems to have come when the tribute
of conquests stopped flowing about 106 AD according to that video.
The decay was much due to the over use of slaves and the growth of large estates beside the decline of the moral virtues of the past.

1239293,3,B00000JYWU,"This has been mentioned ad nauseam by other reviewers but there is a tremendous amount of repetition within this series. Some cut-away scenes are shown 4-5 times on the same disc. While I realize this helped keeping filming costs low it also added a certain degree of boredom in the viewers. You have been warned.

  Things that I enjoyed-

- A decent overview of the Roman Empire. In this series you have the entire history of Rome - from the founding to the sacking!
- Nice commentary on the times with an historical perspective of the times.
- Some of the emperors are discussed in great detail - such as Nero.

Things for improvement

- A little too low budget - the repetitive scenes prove to be exhausting.
- For a 6 hour documentary there is surprisingly little depth on a variety of topics - Julius Caesar, Caligula, Mark Anthony or even the Roman presence in Great Britain.
- The narration is a bit monotous.
- The history of Christians in Rome is spotty. In all honesty, this whole section was poorly done - there is no mention of Paul -and unless I missed it the conversion of Constatine to Christianity.

Final Verdict-

  Interesting documentary but far from being authoritative. My recommendation is to do like me and watch it on cold rainy Sunday afternoons. If you are a history buff - it is worth watching. However, if you are a teacher watch-out for an unruly classroom if you try to force this on your students!

I've seen them all just about and this one gives a great picture over a one thousand year span of a rise to power that has yet to be and possibly will never be matched.

I was very happy about the extras in the Rome set of DVDs, but the disc on Gladiators was not just really detailed, but the extras are, in themselves, worth the price.  If you know anybody who enjoys history, this three disc set should help feed their need for Rome.  Like most shows on history aimed at an American audience it kinds of smoothes everything out and skips many of the details.  So if somebody already knows a lot about Rome you may wish to get them a book.  But if they are just getting into it, or wish to know about the over all history and culture of Rome, this is the best DVD set to buy for them.",1219104000,3,742,4.0479452054794525

But, as other reviewers have said, it's very repetetive.  When you are watching 5 hours worth, you kind of expect that they would have cut as much as they could have, but they didn't.  It is, however, difficult to not repeat things when you are trying to make logical points, as this documentary does.  The problem is, they don't even try to pretend that they aren't saying the same things.  They will use the exact same words to describe it, they will show the same video clips, etc.  And, sometimes they use the same video clip for several different events, making it feel like a less-interactive real-time-strategy computer game.",1140307200,5,830,4.928057553956834

I have taught European history for years and have found that outside of ""Sparticus"", ""Ben Hur"" and various different fictional movies (even ""Caligula""), that most people know that there was a huge and long lasting empire of Rome, but have no idea where it came from nor where it went.

This series answers those questions.

I have heard people refer to the United States in terms of the rise and fall of Rome. If it is true that history repeats itself then I think it's important, even though there might be some things in this taped series that don't appeal to purists, that this sort of history medium be available to young and old alike.",1101859200,5,817,4.620689655172414
1239304,4,B00000JYWU,"There is no shortage of material if you're looking to learn about the Roman Empire. It is one of the most studied topics in history, particularly when it comes to books and documentaries. It was an empire that Streched from Scotland to the Sahara - from Spain to Saudi Arabia. An empire uniting the meditaranian world into a solid political entity with one currency, one set of roads, consistantly well planned cities, ingenious architecture, a common set of laws, a common language, and protected by the mightiest military machine of the ancient and classical periods. Many of these aspects europe is only today striving to achieve once more with the EU.

Rome: Power & Glory is a fairly good documentary on this great empire to which much of today's government architecture and many of our laws owe thier heritage.

I found plenty to like about this series. It offers plenty of information across 6 aproximatley one hour episodes. The series is broken up into 6 volumes each of which covers a different aspect of Rome - the rise of the empire, the fall of the empire, the effect of Romanization across the empire, etc. Thus it's organized by topic rather than chronologically. Whether or not you like this system will depend on personal taste and on whether or not you plan to watch them all at once (unlikely unless you have 6 hours to kill). A positive aspect of this is that if you want to know about a specific topic concerning Rome you can pull out the volume relating to that and watch it. however if you really want a good understanding of the timeline of events, the growth, the hieght and the decline, then you may dislike this as it breaks things up. You'll talk about ceasar for example in different episodes at differing levels of depth and in different lights. Basically this method has both it's benefits and it's consequences.

The series is entertaining and well shot the whole way through. While some footage seems to be reused, they attempt to use old movie footage from films such as ""Scipio Africanus"" in conjunction with modern images of the ruins, paintings, drawings, and plenty of shots of reenactments to create a more vissually diverse experience. But a lot of this footage is reused throughout the episodes which can feel a bit redundant.

The informative content in the series is pretty good. Lot's of interviews, good naration, very intriguing, and entertaining at the same time. It also offers some solid analysis of the events and thier importance. Lots of attempts are made to put these in perspective and offer the information in ways that most people today will easily relate to and be able to digest. This includes many lovely analogies that at least one other reviewer complained about. When talking about the gladiators they are compaired to modern day Mike Tysons. When talking about Romanization and the spread of grecco-roman culture and it's effects, they draw analogies to present day americanization (english being common language and the spread of mcdonnalds and coca cola and american music etc). I think this is great. Not only does it effectively get accross the point and put things in perspective while demonstrating what the implications were - but it also goes a long way to say that we need to look back to history to learn it's lessons. America is very much the Rome of today's world and we had better look at the fall of Rome and avoid the pitfalls of being a super power. This is appraoched in the series several times in a subtle kind of way, implying that the spread of culture and the disparity of wealth can cause resentment of a society - and obviously we see this happening today.

Rome: Power and Glory is not perfect though. It's a great overview of Rome - from republic to empire to the fall. What it lacks is sufficient depth in certain areas. Do not expect a complete coverage of roman history - the topical apprach works well in giving you an overview of Rome, not so good if you want you want to know all about the specific wars, battles, generals etc. You won't learn about the battle of Cannae, or cover hannibal in any kind of detail.

In the end it may not be the best documentary about Rome, but it's a good one. Especially for those wanting the big pictures and some depth while not a completely comprehensive look at Rome. This would be great for the class room or the living room - and even if this series doesnt serve all your needs it will make a solid addition to your collection.",1095465600,47,4461,4.662007623888183

1239306,1,B00000JYWU,"I hope in the near future a real and truthful series comes out on Roman Civilization where professors from the Latin languages countries (cultures and languages connected to Rome) can also participate with their comments. The series is biased and only uses English and American scholars that destroy the beauty of the Roman Civilization many times thru their Yankee and Anglo point of view. When a man (I can't call him a professor) named Keith Hopkins with his biased attitude compares the City of Rio with ancient Rome in its porverty and mess, then he should take another look at our present planet and his own country. I don't think Keith Hopkins has ever been to Rio at all and his comments are a reflection of his poor personal view of the world today. This only shows what a bad historian he is and how he fails to understand the modern world. He should compare the miseries of Ancient Rome with the poor neighborhoods of present day London, where immigrants from the former British Empire are treated as third class citizens.",1091836800,3,1033,4.712707182320442
1239307,1,B00000JYWU,"I took a chance ordering my first DVD series about the power and glory of Rome.  I felt it would be an excellent idea for my family to gain a complete perspective about the Roman Empire.  I understood it was not going to have the same quality of ""The Passion"" or the blood and hoopla of ""Braveheart,"" however, I was expecting to get an excellent historical perspective about the splendor and magnificence of Rome, the greatest empire of the World.
Instead, my family viewed a hodgepodge of ruins, black and white blurred segments, 'candy-coated' imagery to soften the senses (the hysteria and shock could not be absorbed as to how Rome really functioned on a daily basis) and colossal amounts of repetitive film clips that became so nauseating that the narrative, in audio, intellectually overwhelmed the content presented on video.
There was some beautiful footage of the countryside and fleeting glimpses of grandeur sprinkled throughout the series, but the splicing and cuts shut down any momentum.  Regrettably, even the documentary got repetitive.  Several comments were contradictory.  Important aspects of Roman society were utterly dismissed, ignored or avoided.  Many statements were biased, misrepresented and utterly false!
For example, the narrative claims that the Barbarians and other cultures were more sadistic and treacherous than the Romans.  Let us use some common sense!  On the admission of the narrators, the Romans were embedding for centuries the fine art of sadism and treachery...while the video is showing repetitive scenes of earlier periods from Disc 1, 2 3 and 4.
I was not very comfortable with the comparisons made between America and Rome.  In fact, it was confusing without deeper analysis. Some incredible comparisons were made, but like many comments given on other subjects on the DVD, they needed to be backed up with evidence, proof and further discussion.",1082937600,33,1895,5.207236842105263
1239308,4,B00000JYWU,"I thought it would be worse because of the relevance given to fighting and gladiators, but it has a lot of information and is quite entertaining. Great for students.

It delivers more than it seems to promise by its cover. It's less than a seminar on Roman history, but more than simple entertainment for kids.",1073260800,5,310,4.636363636363637
1239309,5,B00000JYWU,"First off, I was surprised to see that no one had yet reviewed this multi-volumed set on the entire history of Rome.  I mean, the Discovery channel shows it at least once a month!  If you're like me and don't mind setting your vcr to tape programs at 2 am over the course of five nights, then go ahead and do so, it's worth it.  However, if you are bereft of cable, or patience, I highly recommend you purchase this boxed set.  The casual history afficianado will be entertained and informed, the student of Roman history generally satisfied, and the social studies teacher thrilled.  Since I'm the last two, I doubly approve of this documentary.  Now for the PROS:  1) Peter Coyote is a reliable voice-over talent, and many will recognize him from his 687 or so commercials spots.  His reading of the script is well paced and sounds informed, especially with respect to pronunciations.  2) The content -- at almost 6 hours in length, we finally have a documentary history of Rome that doesnt gloss over whole periods, important rulers, societal factors and cultural aspects like most other one or two-hour videos do.  Divided into segments that chronologically overlap at times, the boxed set nevertheless weaves together the important THEMES of Roman history, rather than simply adhering to a rigid linear format.  We have: Rome's Rise to Power, The Conquest of the Legions, Corruption of Power, Grasp of Empire and the Cult of Order.  Finally, a documentary that doesnt treat Rome solely as a cruel, bloodthirsty, slave-owning, tyrannical bully!  The visuals are stunning, the commentaries are given by the usual learned English scholars, and above all, it's ACCURATE, by Jove!  Rome's lasting influence on  American culture is not ignored, nor is Rome's preeminence as the  greatest Empire in the history of the world.  If you teach Ancient cultures or Latin, buy this video and show an episode per week.  Your kids will love you.  If you're sick of the endless WWII crap they show on the Hitler, er, I mean History Channel, treat yourself to this informative history of the Romans and their glorious past. The only negative side I see, could have been about 6 hours longer...",1045526400,25,2180,4.8590785907859075
1239310,1,B00000JYWU,"If this were a book rather than a video then I would say there is a mistake on almost every page.  The author's understanding of what he/she writes about is superficial in many areas, and often what is said is simply wrong.  If you already have a good foundation in the history of Rome then this might be a two star video since parts of it may be entertaining or otherwise interesting.  However, this is a very misleading way to start an understanding of Roman history.  The author seems either to be incompetent, or perhaps is consciously unconcerned with the facts in order to twist Roman history to fit into some political statement the author wants to make.  Either way this is not a very insightful, accurate work.",1019433600,32,719,4.5859375
1239311,4,B00000JYWU,"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. The content on this DVD is arranged topically instead of chronologically. Because of this, you can watch each episode independently of the others instead of all in a row like I did. :-)
Some of the content is repeated across episodes as they recap an earlier one (this originally aired on TLC) so even though it is 5 hours total, it is probably closer to 4 hours of unique content.
The narrator is generally good in giving content and the expert sound bites are just long enough, though it would be nice to hear more.
There are very few re-enactments in this series. They have a stock set of actions they re-use in different contexts.
I would definitely recommend this for people to watch.",1018224000,5,729,4.488721804511278
1239312,4,B00000JYWU,"I love history and civilizations, and this DVD was a great catch for me because of its educational value and entertaining side as well. It was little lengthy, so a guy who's not really interested in history might not want to sit down and watch through the whole thing.
I have one complaint though, the events weren't told in order! There are six chapters, they start with the rising of the Roman empire and end with its collapse; However chapters overlap in their events and at times they become very confusing! That really annoyed me. It annoyed me that it deserved wiping out a whole star :)",1004832000,15,593,4.5514018691588785
1239313,5,B00000JYWU,"At 5+ hours, this is certainly an ambitious documentary of the rise, hegemony & eventual decline and fall of the Roman Empire.  For many subjects, one would think that a study of this length would be overkill.  However, when you're talking about an empire which spanned nearly 1,200 years, 5 hours barely scratches the surface.  Don't get me wrong, this is a fairly well-done piece.  However, there is only so much that you can stick into a video of this duration.
One of the most impressive aspects of the DVD is its inclusion of people of varying expertise.  Sure, it has the normal college history professors, but it also summons an art professor, as well as a US Army general to discuss Roman military tactics, and a US Senator to analyze Roman politics & diplomacy.
On the downside, some notable personages in history are omitted, such as Spartacus, Attila the Hun, Shapur, Vespasian (except for a brief biographical sketch) and Justinian.  Again, 5 hours is hardly enough time to delve into every nook & cranny of Roman history, but one would think that these names would stand out, nonetheless.
The worst feature of this documentary is the soundtrack.  It is very amateurish and repetitive, basically the same musical phrase played over & over & over again.  By the 3rd hour, hearing it gets quite annoying.  One need only view ""Greeks: Crucible of Civilization"" to be convinced that there is no reason a historical documentary can't have a quality score.
The melodramatic and redundant music is almost entirely offset by the professionalism of the narrator, however;  Coyote's voice is pleasing to the ear & does not get tiresome to listen to.
What the DVD does cover, it covers very well.  As others have mentioned, some material does get repeated every so often, but it is sometimes necessary for what the creators are trying to accomplish.  As an American, I found the nexus that was emphasized between the Roman Republic & the polemics of the United States' founding fathers quite interesting.  However, I am sure that people from other parts of the globe will likely be disinterested in that digression.
All in all, this is an excellent introduction to the ancient world of the Roman empire.  One cannot admire too much a people who were so bloodthirsty as to stage gladatorial games where thousands of men & animals would be killed in a single day.  The approach of this inquiry does a credible job of giving a balanced treatment to both the noble traits and the vices of the Roman people.
If you have any interest in classical history at all, I would highly recommend this DVD.  Both novice and historian have a lot to gain by owning this scholarly and insightful study of Rome.",994982400,140,2693,4.784017278617711
1239314,3,B00000JYWU,"If I could offer 3.5 stars it would be a toss as to whether I did that, or gave it the 3 stars I'm offering.  This is a reasonably competent production, but, as other reviewers have noted, it's repetition is very noticeable - even if you view the episodes in isolation.
Good points
The series does move from the beginnings of Rome to it's demise, and does give a convincing feel for the ebb and flow of Rome.  It covers quite a few notable incidents, some of which will almost definitely be new to viewers unless they are students of ancient history.  It succeeds in conveying something of the originality of Roman society (while noting it's heavy Greek borrowings), and appears to give a balanced assessment.  There is a reasonable information content in this DVD.
Bad points
There was one episode in particular in which I felt over 50% of what was discussed had already been discussed.  There must be at least four or five times when the same incident is recounted.  This is all wasted space really.  Also, I felt that the flow of the series was a bit disordered.  Whilst it is roughly chronological, it digresses, following a thematic path sometimes, but seems to do haphazardly.
Summary
It is moderately informative and credible, but won't satisfy those looking for a lot of detail or a scholarly account.  The occasional short interviews with academics with are interspersed throughout are effective, but probably could have been more frequent.  I think there is too much emphasis on the emotional reality of Rome for most of it's citizens, and not quite enough on it's intellectual or engineering achievements.  They are mentioned but not explored.",987724800,89,1654,4.829787234042553
1239315,4,B00000JYWU,"The format is obviously made for 6 TV spots.  The volumes are somewhat chronological, with significant overlap and repetition of key concepts.  If you choose to watch them straight through, as I did, the repetition will become annoying.  However, if you watch them one a day, or better still one every other day, the repetition is welcome.  If you buy it, I strongly suggest you to not watch it straight through.  I would have given it 5 *s, but the format prevents me from doing so.
Notes: The ""Christian bashing"", mentioned by another reviewer, is not uncalled for, and I would suggest that he/she read some of the historical accounts.  Some written by Christians.  Lets face facts, Christianity is and has been completely intolarnant of other beliefs.  Moreover, the documentary is quite complementary to Christianity.  The timeline in the DVD version is very useful, as the volumes are not entirely chronological.",984355200,11,917,5.0198675496688745
1239316,4,B00000JYWU,"Great story of Rome, where each tape takes a subject and deals with it in more detail.  Lots of old movies are used, which is something I found nice.  Only one big problem, that was added to the DVD version, is that the VHS version has no timeline.  One has to remember that the tapes deal with events that overlap the events and facts they talk about in other tapes.  So a person might have trouble with realizing the overlapping cause and effect of the history. It is still a great set of tapes for the price, but if you want more details on certain subjects you will want to get a book (or look it up on some of the Roman web sites).",982800000,9,636,4.104838709677419
