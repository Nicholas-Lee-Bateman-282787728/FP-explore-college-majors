The voice acting is absolutely beautiful and so is the art and animation. The soundtrack is stunning as well. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jizz so hard you'll swear you just saw Ryuu from Street Fighter having an orgy with hit 70's band The Village People (of course that doesn't happen, but your nipples will be so erect that anything's possible).

Buy this. It's worth every penny for memories that will last you a lifetime",1459728000,,539,4.858695652173913
8254547,1,B001469C1M,This was awful. The animation was poor enough to have been made on a computer with the old windows art program. The voice acting was so pathetic as to be cringe inducing. Cheesy music abounds. This is a big waste of time and money. The only effort art wise was placed in the cover art.,1314576000,12,285,4.2
8254548,1,B001469C1M,"If you're looking for really badly done anime, horrible Scottish/British accents for the dub, and just poor poorly executed everything - then this is the DVD for you! It was worth a laugh at just the poor over all quality. The animation style is right up there with some of the gay comics that have been published that are truly abysmal and definately not realistic in ... er... size of parts. The dialog stinks, the plot stinks, it's not even worth watching for the sex scenes. So yeah - view it on line and then scrub the image from your brain.",1312934400,16,546,4.415841584158416
