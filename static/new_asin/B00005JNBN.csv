1506538,4,B00005JNBN,"Don't believe all the negative reviews.  I'm so surprised at some of the reviewers comments.  Reviewers who gave this movie such guff, need to come clean about what kind of horror they enjoy.  This is not a slasher movie, nor a dark assylum type setting, nor a screaming fest; it is a true scary movie in the classic sense of haunted houses, curses, ghostly images, and creepy music.  I think it's very well done and deserving of a nod from people who like this genre of film.",1112140800,5,476,4.436781609195402

1506540,1,B00005JNBN,"This movie was absolutely dreadful.  Don't waste your time or money.  The story line was a dud and the acting was far from mediocore.  The story really didn't go anywhere and it was quite predicable.  Not at ALL scary -- Not one bit.  People were talking through half of the movie due to absolute boredom.

What a waste.....

I heard the movie company had this on their shelf about 2 years before they got around to making it. There was a reason!  Better movies were made first.... this one shouldn't have been made at all.",1110844800,3,523,4.431578947368421
1506541,1,B00005JNBN,"Darkness had been shelved by Dimension films for a while. They made a nice trailer and pumped it out during Christmas when people would be to busy to go searching for reviews. I never thought I would see a movie worse than Jeepers Creepers, but this could be that movie. This is the kind of movie that makes you hate Hollywood. After watching this movie, I felt like I had been hustled. Like all the idiots who buy a thighmaster or go on the Atkins Diet.  There is not one thing good about this movie. I have seen Troma films with better dialouge. The Story makes no sense, I give up

Please stay away from this garbage.",1110412800,4,620,4.2905982905982905
1506542,3,B00005JNBN,"I never bothered to see it in the theaters when it came to the states. I was a bad girl and couldn't wait and found a DVD burn from Spain, I believe, that I could download.

Apparently, this was the way to go.

I sat on my couch and watched it on my laptop with the headphones on. I'd been watching a lot of Asian horror lately so I guess you could say I was beginning to feel a little immune to the ""boo"" scares. Well, this one went beyond the boo scares and rose above some pedestrian dialogue with a great sense of atmosphere and tension. It isn't the most original story, and some say it borrows from ""Darkness Falls"", despite the fact that ""Darkness"" technically came out before it.

I think what separates this from a lame by-the-numbers movie like  Darkness Falls was the fact that it retained a fair sense of mystery as to where exactly the evil came from. Not knowing this was enough to fill the viewer with enough unease to keep them as nervous and disoriented as the main characters were. Some people forget that not knowing is more frightening than having it spelled out for you from frame 1.

If you enjoy good, spooky atmosphere, cinematography and don't mind a little nightmarish ambiguity, then this film might work for you. It's not the best I've seen, but it did creep me out pretty good and as a horror film is actually pretty worthwhile.

So don't be a critic's drone and check this puppy out. Just make sure you see this ""unrated"" version and not the crappy, chopped up American version. And slap on those headphones!",1108771200,5,1538,4.4361702127659575
1506543,4,B00005JNBN,"Avoid the Americanized PG-13 cut of this film at all costs and seek out the unrated Spanish version.  This is a great horror movie, with some of the scariest images I have ever seen on film.  I am a huge horror nut, and admist to being a bit of a snob (i refuse to see the Dawn of the Dead remake, even though I hear it's good) and I loved this movie.  Dimension Films should be burned to the ground and their executives shot in front of their families for what they do to good movies in order to make a profit.  First this movie and now Wes Craven's ""Cursed"" which even he says will suck.

1506632,4,B00005JNBN,"I haven't noticed that this movie acheived the best director and cinematography at the Barcelona Film Awards. I think this film deserves it.
In some ways, this movie is not so great. Some moments, it scared me but most of all, this is not that scary horror film.
But I can say out loud that the ligheing and cinematography are really good and Anna Paquin,Lena Olin, like always, are very lovable. More Anna.
Ending seems very vague but was ok for me.
I do understand that this movie's rate is so low. It misses something. This doesn't seems to be a fully satisfied hollywood type of movie.
But for me in an artistic way, I kind of liked it.
I bought this DVD in Korea and it was just 2.50$
And for the price, this was a wonderful surprise. It was kind of new experience for me.
The story is so so filled with chiche. I've been watching the exact same story for maybe 5-6 times from other films.
But the way how this director made is quite different. And I liked it that way.
Everything seems hidden. Nothing was clearly shown. This is not a slasher movie. It still has a lot of blood but with a dark back ground light-which is very artistic.
Last word.
Anna Paquin +lights+cinematography+Hidden children.
Those are the key beauty of this film.",1453852800,2,1243,4.432314410480349

1506721,5,B00005JNBN,Fantastic thriller. Definitely not for children. An excellent plot line with interesting characters in the story line. I would certainly recommend this film to other thriller/horror/mystery lovers. 5 stars plus,1404604800,3,210,6.033333333333333
1506722,3,B00005JNBN,"A small part of me thinks Darkness is a pretty decent movie, which is why I'm giving it 3 and a half stars.  No it's not a complete flop like many reviewers below think, and of course it's by NO means a masterpiece either but if you treat it as the Amityville Horror's baby brother, it's not so bad then.

Darkness has all the ingredients of a well-made horror movie.  Lots of atmosphere, lots of uncertainty and mysteriousness taking place inside the household involving ghostly children, pretty good characters overall... perhaps the biggest problem is that Darkness tends to rely too much on the unknown and hardly ever delivers on the goods.  When you think something scary enough to blow you away is about to happen... it usually fizzles out and leaves you disappointed.  Another small problem is that the storyline is often times confusing- I mean I think we've established that a bunch of demonic children are haunting the house and targeting the younger brother in particular, but there's also the element of darkness that plays a minor role (arguably an underutilized role which is unfortunate) until close to the end.  I mean think about it- usually demonic activity occurs in the darkness anyway.  The movie writers should have gone the extra distance to focus on the element of darkness.  At least I believe the darkness should have been applied better due to the title of the movie.

But yeah, the characters are pretty awesome I thought.  It basically centers around Anna Paquin's character.  She's the older teen sister, and she's determined to figure out the clues pertaining to the unexplainable attitude change of her father (played by Iain Glen) and the odd circumstances that surround her younger brother usually when he's alone in his bedroom playing with crayons on the floor (whenever they roll under his bed, get ready!)  The mother is basically a helpless lady that doesn't understand why her husband suddenly explodes in anger sometimes nor his sudden fascination with antiques, so she sits by and watches his temper flare up without explanation.  She does figure out how to handle this later on, however.  Other characters enter the picture later on, but their appearance is either unnecessary or tacked on illogically.

There ARE a few good scares.  One of them occurs when the mother turns on the stove burner in the dark kitchen near the end- something awesome happens afterwards that admittedly shocked me pretty good!  The very last scene is somewhat of a disappointment.  The movie writers were going for a dramatic moment of uncertainty, but.. I dunno, I think the last scene should have played out for about 5 more minutes and *then* ended.  Oh and perhaps unintentionally, how about the scene in the beginning with the father taking his son to school and the father suddenly has a seizure and needs urgent help?  Talk about a VERY disturbing moment.  If I was the son sitting in the passengers seat, I'd be quite traumatized permanently.  This is actually the most disturbing part of the entire movie for different reasons unrelated to the main plot.

Overall no, this is nothing horror fanatics haven't already seen hundreds of times before so I can't really recommend it unless you're dying for a horror.  Dying for a horror?  Wow what a bad choice of words, haha.  Seriously this movie's good but all the investigating that Anna Paquin does is nothing we haven't seen before/more thoroughly in other better movies, but the characters are interesting enough, and the suspense involving the demonic children appearing in the darkness *does* often times keep you on the edge of your seat, so it ain't all bad.",1402704000,,3645,4.8957654723127035

1506724,1,B00005JNBN,"This is a film where next to nothing happens and the little that does happen is predictable and boring.  Nothing but poorly executed horror tropes: Family in strange new house -- check, Only one person seems to know anything and he seems creepy for no real reason and ultimately serves next to no purpose in the film -- check.  Dimwitted mother who could have done something if she was not content to let some man she has barely interacted with run her life -- check.  Nubile teen daughter who figures everything out, yet does everything common sense would tell her not to do -- check.  Boy from area who is hot for nubile girl, who could have stopped things by going to pretty much anyone he knows, yet he acts like an idiot being led around by the young hottie -- check.  Strangely scared and scarred kid who appears to be being abused, but who doesn't stop both sister and mother from believing Dad did it until they have all but turned against him -- check.  One person nubile girl runs to is the one person (grandfather) common sense should tell her not to go to as the only way the story makes any sense is if her father is the escaped child and the grandfather is and was a part of everything, it is after all Granddad's house, he keeps insisting they return to the house, and Dad, who hasn't had any issues since last in proximity to his Dad is suddenly sickly/crazy the minute his father (who is also conveniently his doctor, and prescribing him meds) is in his life again -- check.  An ending that makes little sense (Did they get tricked into leaving and then driven into Darkness, or were they in the house the entire time and tricked into thinking they left), and who was the house actually after, Dad, son, daughter, if only one, why is everyone, including nubile girl's love interest taken? -- check.

1506727,3,B00005JNBN,"All in all it was pretty scary movie.  But, there were a couple of plot errors.  Acting was good although sometimes melodramatic.  In my opinion the movie did not need subtitles, the sound was good.  It was worth the $3.99 to watch, but I would have been disappointed if I had paid to see it in the movies.  I rated it a three since it was both suspenseful and scary.",1379721600,2,367,4.185714285714286
1506728,1,B00005JNBN,"My review is slanted entirely to those with sufficient hearing loss to need subtitles fully  to understand a film in which a good deal of the dialogue is either whispered, accompanied by clanging, banging, sound effects, or adapted only to those with quite superior natural hearing.  I always listen via excellent headphones but this was one of those soundtracks which just could not be heard clearly. Once upon a time, all American soundtracks, at least, were made so that one could hear every word spoken even when sitting in the last  row of the great movie palaces of the day. Now the sound is subject, apparently, to artistic manipulation,  and even those with only mild hearing loss are unable to grasp what is being said.
So far as I could see, the movie might well have had some good qualities, but I have to leave the telling of that story to those who could hear it.",1373846400,4,876,4.596153846153846

1506759,3,B00005JNBN,"Not overly engaging or very memorable.  One thing i didn't like is the lack of subtitles.  In a film like this where people talk softly or with thick accents, subtitles really help.  Nothing i dislike more than having to crank the volume to hear a conversation then have music BLAST out of nowhere a second after for a cheap scare.  One other problem is doing the shakey camera garbage.  Yeah yeah, he was trying to go for camera effects.... pfffft more like, ""I cannot create real tension, through creative lighting or dialog so i'll shake the camera instead""  It doesn't happen alot, but i am just getting tired of horror films using shakey cam as a crutch for creating tension - i guess it is replacing the blasting music jump scare.  So it kinda missed the mark on being a memorable ""chilling"" horror film and falls into the ""It's ok"" category.",1347235200,4,848,4.576158940397351
1506760,3,B00005JNBN,"I wish I could have given this film four stars, but I just couldn't bring myself to do that. This is not a bad film, it just suffers from some problems that could have been avoided if the filmmakers had spent a little more time with it. First off, there wasn't enough development of the backstory about the house and the missing children. There was an event which had occurred in this house forty years earlier which was central to the current storyline, but we are told practically nothing about this event except a few flashes of children running and a few passing references. What went on there? Why were the children running, and from what were they running? Secondly, not enough time was given to developing the current cast of characters. We don't know them well enough to really be all that concerned about their well being. It takes almost the whole movie just to makes us feel like we know these people. Why take so long? Third, the plotline was disjointed in the sense that we had difficulty following what was happening. We could see what the people were doing and hear what they were saying, but so often we were just asking what this all meant. Some scenes seemed disconnected from the story. The bottom line, I think, was time. The filmmakers needed to fill in these gaps to make the story complete and meaningful and easier to understand. As I said in the beginning, this is not a bad film. It had the potential to be a really great film. I think Anna Paquin did a great job as usual. She seemed to be the glue that held everything together for us. And I admired the way she was so protective of her younger brother Paul. And I can't say enough about young Stephan Enquist, the young actor who played Paul. He was wonderful. I couldn't believe that he had never acted before, but it's true. This is his only acting credit to date. But he was as talented as he was adorable. I found out that he was half Swedish and half Spanish, so that explains his good looks. I watched this film twice before I wrote this review because I wanted to be sure I understood what I wanted to say. And I think I've done that. I wanted to be as fair as possible to this film. I do not want to discourage anyone from watching ""Darkness,"" I just want you to watch it carefully and try to bear in mind that there IS more to the story than you see on the screen. If you do this, I think you will come away with at least a little respect and appreciation for what the filmmakers were trying to do. I hope my thoughts have been of at least some help to you. So, once again, watch the movie. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I tell you again it really isn't a bad film. Not at all. So enjoy.",1346544000,,2688,4.293307086614173
1506761,1,B00005JNBN,"Okay, in THEORY I really like films about creepy old houses, but I have to wonder if anything new can be found in this genre. It's pretty much all been done by now, in film after film after film, and that's only too obviously apparent when watching this picture. Okay, I'll admit that when watching spooky films alone in the dark, I'm kind of jumpy---so this film is good for a few scares. But man, that's about all that can be said for it---visually and plot-wise, every component of this film can be found in other better films.

There's no point in going on in great detail---well, apart from the pleasure to be found in making fun of it! So I won't bother to say much---apart from wow, here you can see THE WORST MOTHER EVER. After moving into this new house it quickly becomes apparent that her little boy is obviously horribly traumatized---and he's waking up every morning with terrible cuts and bruising around his face. What does the mother say? ""Oh, he's just scratching himself in his sleep."" Sheesh... she also ignores her daughter's warnings at EVERY TURN and apparently has no problem in leaving a psychopath alone with the children.

I picked out the evil villain of the piece the very instant he appeared onscreen---no surprise there. So, let's just say this film is a total piece of **** that made no sense from beginning to end; it's like a pile of random scripts were thrown into a blender and the resulting mish-mash was poured onto the screen. Oh, and I hated the ending.

(Now, I have to admit I took note of some very nice stained glass windows on display in this picture, so I guess that could be a positive. I also noticed that the haunted house had the EXACT same wallpaper as one of the rooms in this house (William Morris' ""Arbutus"" pattern). However, I'm not exactly thrilled to have the same wallpaper as a demon-possessed house.)

Now, there are plenty of funny posts about this film on IMDB that make me laugh---for instance, user ""reciprocity_failure"" wrote:

""The movie was about the house...then it was about the darkness...then it was about the kids...then it was about the eclipse...then it was about the satanic ritual or whatever which was fortunately published in detail in some book at the library which wasn't too hard to find...then it was about the doctor...then it was about the house again...then it's about ghosts that can duplicate people or something...  make up your ******* mind you demons.""",1313452800,2,2442,4.707259953161593
1506762,3,B00005JNBN,"The movie is slow to develop. This normally is not bad because during this time most scripts build character. This movie never builds character, which is its major downfall. Anna Paquin is the main character as the daughter Regina, yet we never get to know her. She is a moody teen who can swim. He has a bad feeling about the house, but it is displayed so poorly. The movie starts to get exciting about half way through. If you can make it until Dad is slicing fruit and is angry, congratulations the movie is about to start. At this point the dull movie begins to get clever. The images of dark figures flashing in the darkness and then not being there is a simple but effective scary effect.

An American family moves to Spain. It is the part of Spain where everyone speaks English and all the radio stations broadcast in English. The house is ""haunted"" and weird things happen when it gets dark. The darkness is evil and has intellect. The problem with the plot twists and scary images is that we really don't care about the family because they never developed them.",1295913600,,1070,4.487179487179487

The acting wasn't as bad as some of the other reviewers said.  the story was a bit confusing, it would have been a better as a novel with more room to tell the tale.  And it wasn't action packed.

But it was scary.  One of the most frightening movies I can remember.  Watch it alone, late at night.  It's not a fun light horror film.  There's a weight to this film... It has problems, mostly with the story and pacing.  But I'll never forget it.",1295481600,3,645,4.24793388429752

1506827,5,B00005JNBN,"I was genuinely scared for the first time in a long time when I watched this movie in theatres when it arrived to Iceland in spahish.
My own theory is that most of the one and two starers are looking for something that goes beyound the sense of fright this film gives someone like me. It's about 'devil worshippers'in lower fifth - dimensional Spain of the late 1990's and beyound , who decide decades earlier to have a house built to harness what the ONA calls 'acausal energies'.
These devil - worshippers believed in what they felt to be the useability of human sacrifice to aid themselves in their deeply dark , seriously sinister 'shamanic'journeying - journeying to the lower forth dimension and beyound.
They allow one member to make a decision to let his child escape , but sacrifice all the other children they felt they had to sacrifice to finish off their ritual - in a manner I found to be one of the most terrifying descriptions in movie history. This film is dark. And I am not pissed off by these one star reviewers of this film , but rather perplexed , wondering what films they may know about which go beyound the Darkness. I chose to use this movie in my own spiritual journeying minus all the brutal violence of course with seriously good results.
I loved the film and saw it again and again and again , in Spanish and in English , and it deals with the concept of child sacrifice by supposedly existing 'satanist groups'you never hear about anywhere , especially not in the writings of the top anti - satanism authors , and in the writings of such authors as David Icke.
The Darkness is not only a scary horror film - it is a sinister horror movie which kind of captivates an atmosphere whose nature as sinister is akin to the atmosphere people felt while watching the Exorcist in the eighties and earlier. This is serious horror and it'll give most people who view it the creeps if they're viewing it for the first time and many of them have not written a review of this movie on amazon.com. This film is more scary than many horror movies that have been released since , but there are a few who to me unleashed the same sense of sinister feeling but they didn't contain any elements relating to other entities than human beings , such as Inside and Frontiers.
This is a very well done horror movie , well worth the title 'one decent horror film'.",1247529600,4,2368,4.45852534562212

I love the blackened mood and overwhelming sense of doom and dread, it's just that it seems to lead up to a disappointing final. If more time had been spent on developing the history underlying the house, the cult, and their child victims, the strength and depth of the story would have carried the horror elements. Of course, the movie would have been longer by maybe 30-60 minutes, but it would have been a lot better for it. As it stands, DARKNESS is a half-baked film full of untapped potential that never quite terrifies.

1506829,1,B00005JNBN,"I love horror movies. Good ones are genius--scary, intriguing, memorable, and revolutionary in their conservatism.

Darkness is none of these things. When I finished it, I was actually angry at the crew for subjecting me to an hour and twenty minutes of drivel. In fact, I turned to the special features and found a behind the scenes featurette there, but even that left me with nothing after it ended abruptly in three minutes.

On the one hand, the plot is completely contrived and obvious: an eclipse is approaching and a ceremony involving children must be performed during the event. On the other hand, the plot is completely preposterous and unexplained: ""the darkness"" is coming, a darkness that is pure evil. The characters discover it through an old book that they mysteriously know about. None of it makes any sense. If I tried to explain it, you would be left shaking your head, just as I am thinking about it.

The good thing about this movie is the camerawork. The light and shadow used throughout the movie is actually pretty great. I like the way the movie lets us see what is in the shadows even though the main characters can't see it. Most of the scares here, what few there are, are through interesting camerwork and the use of darkness.

If it were not for the camerawork, I would give it zero stars (if such a thing were possible).",1208390400,3,1352,4.644351464435147
1506830,1,B00005JNBN,"There are movies that come out that present high expectations in their viewers. And there are movies that come out that don't offer expectations all that high, but enough to make fans curious. Horror fans love their stuff, and are sorely tempted when watching a preview for this movie. But this one goes beyond showing the good stuff in the previews. This one sinks to showing nothing but those scenes AND trying to convince you that it is at least a decent movie. It falls far short.

The story revolves around Regina (Anna Paquin), a young teenage girl whose parents have just moved her and her younger brother Paul (Stephan Enquist) to Spain where her father grew up. Their grandfather lives there and helps them and they settle in a remote house just outside of town, one that needs a little work.

From the moment the movie begins, there are unsettling things happening in the house. Paul begins drawing some disturbing pictures that seem to relate to the film's prologue where a young boy is on the run from something or someone terrible found in the house.

Regina's parents Maria and Mark (Lena Olin and Iain Glen) seem to be very loving parents. But dad has an attack while driving one day and that's when we, the viewers, find out that he has had them before. And they terrify Regina. Afterwards, dad begins to have more frequent bouts of attacks and starts to act irrationally, scaring Regina and Paul even more although mom refuses to admit there is anything wrong.

Anyway, the films unravels slowly, offering us glimpses into what is causing all of these problems but never totally telling us until near the end. And the answer is one most will figure out early on. Not to mention the fact that is not the least scary. Any film maker can offer a few jump scenes in a film. But to truly terrify an audience, you have to come straight at them. This movie plays around way too much.

The story behind the house and those who inhabit it offer the briefest glimpse of where this movie might have gone, offering just a speck of something interesting. But plot and the secret revealed are so overly convoluted that by the time you finish, you just don't care. And then ending is completely disappointing.

If you love horror films, rent one of the newer releases out there or go see something...anything...new in theaters. But as for THE DARKNESS, leave it in the dark.",1205539200,2,2376,4.618483412322274

Perhaps because it seems to be the product of a number of international production finance groups (too many cooks in the kitchen) the script is a bit confusing and has some gaping holes in it... but the performances are excellent and the direction gently raises the hair on your neck enough times to make it an intelligent late night popcorn flick. The director understands that shadows aren't meant to reveal everything, and that oddities fleetingly glimpsed just outside the corner of your eye can be the most chilling. The ham fisted director of ""1408"" may want to take note...

You can justifiably find a number of things to complain about in this film but you definitely won't be buying any spooky old houses in the Spanish countryside in the immediate future.

1506834,4,B00005JNBN,"First off, I have spent a bit of time glancing at many of the reviews on this website. I find many of them unfair and lacking evidence to state their cases. In my opinion, I just don't think that some people put the effort into understanding this movie as they should have done.

If you pay VERY close attention to the story line, the terror of it is insurmountable. The effect of the story is very conveying, weighing down on your mind and ultimately, sending a chill down your spine. Sure, this plot line may have been seen a million times before. But, in this day and age, what is original anymore?

Another set of complaints was how the cast was terrible. I will concede that the cast could have been a bit better acted. But, hey, it works. The cast's acting did nothing to draw attention away from the central story line. Sorry if all film companies can't hire actors like Sarah Michelle Gellar or anything. This is the best that they can do everyone. Cut them a little slack.

As the old saying goes, ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" This is very true in regards to this movie. If you just look on the surface of the movie, sure, you are going to hate it. But, if you take the time to look inwards and see the terrifying plot that lies within, I guarantee that you will find this movie rather enjoyable.

A) You cant choose 2 1/2 stars and

B) Visually, the creepiness works

C) The cast is actually quite better than they come across....

But not even Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Iain Glen, and Giancarlo Giannini can save this film from becoming a lukewarm mess. The story has been done a million times before, and usually with far better results. This is ""The Others"" meets ""Amityville"" meets every 'modern man tries to bring Satan forth into modern times' film ever made.

This film had such potential, but, like many of it's ilk, that potential is never realized. Iain Glen is highly convincing as the father slowly losing his mind, but, at times it comes across over-acted. Lena Olin comes off stiff as the mother....probably because she realizes NO mother would be that uninterested in the lives of her children. Anna Paquin and Giannini turn in the only performances worth noting, yet Paquin is forced to carry the entire film, and she seems to be the only person that genuinely cares about the outcome (its also pretty off-putting that both her mother and father have an accent, as does her little brother, but she sounds all-American...yet we're supposed to believe that daddy moved from Spain to the US at a very young age, and that little brother has known ONLY the USA as home).

The creepiness of this film, in its editing techniques, use of sound and lighting, is the saving grace....a saving grace that leads up to an ending that can only be called a letdown.",1161820800,2,1582,4.693140794223827
1506913,1,B00005JNBN,"When you're on holiday with your parents, there's not much to do at nights. Pay ridiculous prices for a small glass of alcohol, or find some other form of entertainment. The hotel we were at had it's own DVD player in the room, so we decided to rent a movie. The hotel had it's own renting service, so the three of us looked through a big binder of DVDs, to see what took our fancy. Could we decide on a single film? Normally, my dad & I like similar films, but my mum doesn't. And most of them, I'd either seen & owned, or wasn't interested. But then a cover that looked mighty familiar jumped out at me. I knew I hadn't seen it, and I couldn't read the blurb as it was in Dutch - I think - so I couldn't jog my memory that I'd already read one review that tore this film to pieces.

We chose Darkness. As soon as I put it on, I realised my mistake. I knew exactly what this film was, but was determined to sit through it. I dozed off during the first quarter of the film, then my mum fell asleep after I woke up, and went to bed, but Dad & I stayed up to watch it.

And watch it.

There's nothing good that can be said about Darkness. A good cast of actors (Anna Paquin, Lena Olin & Iain Glen) were just lost in a heavy script, which made no sense, plus it had elements of a Japanese horror movie, and elements of The Shining. It picked up about three quarters of the way through, but lost the thread again, and Dad & me ended up severely frustrated by the whole thing. It made no sense, and the trailer, which promised at so much, was a major let down.

I have absolutely no idea why this film is getting five star reviews on Amazon. You're all crazy. When not one, but TWO people fall asleep during the movie, there's got to be something said about awful it is.

1506916,3,B00005JNBN,"Darkness, is a film unlike any I have seen.

The subtextual references to satanism and its inner oculuncies

bound off of the screen. Darkness is not so much of a abstract thing in this movie, but a character(devious like the Norse God Loki). The human beings immersed in it are somehow unaware of all of its inner trappings until the very end. Just like any great disaster flick. Some may say Darkness does not explore its theme well enough. I beg to differ, the scene where Anna Paquin is left alone in the house to fend for herself against the slippery black marauders is wrought full of tension. The theme of darkness is not so much ""Oh my Gosh! What just happened!""

But more so ""Imagine if this should happen.""

Consider this. Any unimaginative film maker can make dead children pop out of nowhere and hum some inconsequential scary tune or whisper some lines. What the director does here in darkness is place the titular entities right next to you..in a place where the most extreme violence or death could be delivered without you even noticing it until it is too late. Now that, my freinds is terror.

Usually in films, I detest understatement. It is most times confusing and does not make a good show.

However, when used properly..as in this film..it can become a great bane to the over all effect of the film.

The understatement here comes with a price..paid in full by the end of this gem.

Thank goodness I saw this on HBO and didn't have to buy theater tickets, or even rent it. I would have been much more disappointed than I am.

Suddenly, the youngest member of the family, a small boy, is troubled by unseen forces, and his older sister must find a way to not only save him but her family.

Anna Paquin plays the older sister, and while normally a talented young actress, she isn't given a chance to do much in the film other than run around without a proper bra. All the actors hand in sub-par performances which does nothing to help a poor script and boring special effects.

There are tons of great horror movies out there, both classic and modern. Silent Hill, Tod Browning's Freaks, Tales From the Crypt- the list is endless if you want some nice horror on DVD.

1507026,4,B00005JNBN,"Fear is an individual thing as far as what scares the soul in us to such a degree that it will continue to haunt us long after we witness it, or in this case, the movie. It seems that from reading the reviews here that the notion of 'fear' is so diverse that we can basically place them into two groups. First we have the new wave horror thriller type movies that the current generation of youngsters seems to relate to and rave about like Soul Survivors or Urban Legends where the fear is forced upon you for the purpose of creating excitement to the paying viewers. The filming angles is an obvious giveaway, like the victims hope you get scared as well. Thus the terror just doesn't seem real at all but since these kids have grown accustomed to the type of horror where blood gore and half nude sexy girls is the requirement on the menu to wet your pallet, then it is good enough. Second is the type of terror that knows how to tap within our fears where there are no boundaries as it grows until the climax is ultimately reach but it will continue on. Your body and mind will feel that blood chilling and un-nerving fear, that you will not be able to go to sleep without worrying what might happen next long after witnessing it. Thus the nightmares begins. This is horror in that old school tradition where our fear are genuine, pure and simple.

Genuine horror is something that youngsters have find difficult to grasp because they are incapable to understand the true nature of fear. They are expecting to be force fed with an onslaught of chills and excitement to satisfy their brainwash pallets so they won't feel rip off for spending money to see it. Fear has a price that money can't touch. We have boat loads of bad movies in the name of horror. If viewers don't get what they expect, then they will complain that it was not scary enough or at all, or it don't make sense...yada yada blah. They just don't get it.

With that said, this movie did scare me in a way that i haven't been been scared in such a long time. It seems to stayed with me when i am alone in the dark that i have not yet been able to shake off. Maybe it's the atmospherics feel which it presents itself. The cinematography is utterly outstanding here...a very important element. The director Jaume Balagueno knows what he is doing in this movie and the point come across quite well by understanding how fear works which he accomplished the right way, without hollywood telling him what to do or else. I have to say that the quiet star in this movie, Anna Paguin, was brilliant as she tries to discover the underlining dark secrets from the past. She is really underrated as an actress because her performance was sensational as she showcase her honest expressions of inner fear that will have you believing...very ethentic. Her looks is made for horror movies, as the victim unfortunately. The latest Amityville Horror remake just didn't get it right like the original one did...they can learn a thing or two from Darkness.

I have seen both the rated and unrated version which there are some noticeable additional footage for added creepiness. Being the owner of the unrated version, i do feel compelled to own the original one as well due to the possible future designation of this movie to be label as a horror genre classic after a few years. Seeing the original on the big screen was worthwhile because it had me trembling in my shoes so I have to say it does make a different whether you watch it in the theater or at home. If you watch it at home, just set up the home theater 5 way speaker system to a nice setting, turn out the lights and be prepared. Your journey into the world of fear is about to begin.

I do recommend Darkness if you are a true fan of horror who can appreciate what fear is and is not. It might creep the daylights out of you when you least expected and stir your mind to wonder what is next, not forced upon just to see you jump. Keep in mind, this is not a great horror movie but it is one of the better ones that i haven't seen in a long time and has the making to become a classic. We just have to wait and see for now. The 'Spotlight Review' above, more or less, understand what i am talking about. If you really want to see top notch horror of the supernatural at its finest, then check out Rosemary's Baby which i also wrote a review on awhile back. That one will put you in a state of fear for a long while after you witness it because it will change you. In fact, you might want to think twice before viewing it because not everyone can handle the terror that awaits if you do.",1130025600,2,4600,4.339140534262485
1507027,4,B00005JNBN,"Fear is an individual thing as far as what scares the soul in us to such a degree that it will continue to haunt us long after we witness it, or in this case, the movie. It seems that from reading the reviews here that the notion of 'fear' is so diverse that we can basically place them into two groups. First we have the new wave horror thriller type movies that the current generation of youngsters seems to relate to and rave about like Soul Survivors or Urban Legends where the fear is forced upon you for the purpose of creating excitement to the paying viewers. The filming angles is an obvious giveaway, like the victims hope you get scared as well. Thus the terror just doesn't seem real at all but since these kids have grown accustomed to the type of horror where blood gore and half nude sexy girls is the requirement on the menu to wet your pallet, then it is good enough. Second is the type of terror that knows how to tap within our fears where there are no boundaries as it grows until the climax is ultimately reach but it will continue on. Your body and mind will feel that blood chilling and un-nerving fear, that you will not be able to go to sleep without worrying what might happen next long after witnessing it. Thus the nightmares begins. This is horror in that old school tradition where our fear are genuine, pure and simple.

Genuine horror is something that youngsters have find difficult to grasp because they are incapable to understand the true nature of fear. They are expecting to be force fed with an onslaught of chills and excitement to satisfy their brainwash pallets so they won't feel rip off for spending money to see it. Fear has a price that money can't touch. We have boat loads of bad movies in the name of horror. If viewers don't get what they expect, then they will complain that it was not scary enough or at all, or it don't make sense...yada yada blah. They just don't get it.

With that said, this movie did scare me and it stayed with me long after. Great atmospherics feel due to the outstanding cinematography. Jaume Balagueno knows what he is doing because he understands inner fear and applies it, without Hollywood telling him what to do or else. The quiet star in this movie, Anna Paguin, was spectacular as she tries to discover the underlining dark secrets from the past. Underrated as an actress, she showcase her true expressions here that will have you believing...very authentic. Her looks is made for horror movies but as the victim unfortunately. The latest Amityville Horror remake with overdone CGI was disappointing to say the least...they can learn a thing or two from Darkness.

I do recommend Darkness if you are a true fan of horror who can appreciate what fear is and is not. It will creep the daylights out of you when you least expected and stir your mind influx......not forced upon just to see you jump.

This movie gets worse as it goes on... not that it starts great, but...

What I didn't expect was to actually enjoy it. As a horror film, not scary. As an occult mystery, however, this movie's got potential. I was intrigued by the plot which as you can read from the other reviews involves an old house, an unfinished ritual, and the new tenant's connection to all the weirdness.

It was nice to see Anna Paquin sport some lead actress chops after her knockout ensemble performances in X-Men and X2. Usually the horror herione is a clueless flake or a pistol packing bad girl. Anna's character was just an old teen missing the US and griping about taking the bus. I was touched by the relationship between Anna's character and her little brother. A nice change from the usual sibling rivalry in films today and it gives the girl soul. Lena Olin(Alias) and Iain(Tomb Raider) were great as the parents. I agree that the cinematography and toned down effects were refreshing. And I loved the ending. I was shocked and satisfied.

Darkness is a beautifully shot, somewhat confusing horror tale that probably doesn't deserve the horrible reviews that accompanied its theatrical release. Now that it's out on video, it's a movie that's well worth picking up on Amazon used as long as you don't go in expecting too much.

The story is about a family from America that moves into a house in Spain, where a murder happened 40 years ago. Anna Paquin and her mom don't get along and there are many scenes  where Anna stomps around and snorts in the throes of teen angst. Anna's brother is kind of like Danny Torrance from ""The Shining"" and he is tormented by the ghosts in the house.  Round this dysfunctional family out with a father who has some vague kind of mental disorder that occasionally causes him to have seizures and turns him into a raving lunatic. If that sounds familiar, it's because the character is a close relative of Jack from ""The Shining"".  Essentially what you've got is: The Torrance Family goes to Europe! (with Anna Paquin).

In other words, the set-up is very familiar and will feel somewhat predictable to anyone who's seen ""The Shining"", ""Amityville Horror (either the original or the remake) and ""Poltergeist"". It is to the credit of the director, Jaume Belaguero, that the movie doesn't have you chapter skipping as soon as you see the similatrities. The movie is shot and edited beautifully, and tends to make up for a somewhat maudlin plotline.

But then the movie becomes a little hard to follow. In a reveal that almost rivals the ridiculous discovery of the torture chamber in the basement in the Amityville Horror remake, we find out that  Anna's house is a demonic temple built by Satanist. 40 years ago, this Satanic Contractor attempted to bring the end of the world (why do people want that?) by performing a ritual that involved the murder of 7 children.  The ritual didn't work because one of the kids escaped. Now, 40 years later, the lunar eclipse is coming, thereby offering another chance for the end of the world. Poor unlucky Anna and her family. That's what you get for moving to Spain, I guess. After the reveal of the coming eclipse and the ritual, and multiple scenes of Anna  swimming in the pool and being angsty, I lost interest and starting playing with my bellybutton lint.

Still, Jaume shoots a good movie, so I kept watching. Even if it was between lint-picking stints. To say that the movie becomes confusing in the end is not quite accurate. That's not what I mean when I say that it becomes hard to follow. It's not that it's confusing, it's just that I completely lost interest and just wanted the credits to roll. Basically, the last reel of the movie involves Anna getting kidnapped by some old guy (who I think might be the Satanic Contractor). She escapes. She runs home and her father starts choking on something. Mom gives him an emergency tracheotomy, and then he dies. And then the eclipse comes. And then evil is unleashed on the world. The end.

Jaume Belaguero has directed a beautifully shot amalgamation of every haunted house movie ever made. The only thing that (thank god) didn't make an appearance in this story was the American Indian Burial Ground.  In the end, it's not good enough to watch more than once, but not bad enough to deserve the scathing reviews it has gotten. One thing that's clear from this movie is that Jaume Belaguero is a talented director. He just needs to let someone else do the writing.",1124928000,2,3488,4.689034369885434

Don't know, neither did the screenwriter, director or producer.

Far, far more ""flesh to the bone"" required, and the main problem; Usually a good and creepy thriller builds itself up to the climax by giving the viewer several ""hints"" on where something wicked will appear, the ""jump-out-of-your-seat""-scenes. In ""Darkness"" (and if you haven't seen the movie you should perhaps read no further since this might be a SPOILER), well, the little boys' pencils being sucked into the darkness one by one -I expected of course something eventually coming out from under there. His bed, I mean. But nothing really happens, and the forces of ""darkness"" itself becomes somehow so... thin. It needs to take some shape. Actually, I'm not sure if I really understood this thriller. Not that it's complicated, but for me the story became a little too far ""out there"". Not that it was bad, it did not bore me at all -but I expected more. I wanted to see more. It's like you're asking questions without getting nearly satisfying enough answers.

1507155,1,B00005JNBN,"As a horror-movie buff I was incredibly disappointed by this movie--renting the 'unrated' version I figured it must be pretty intense..or at least slightly thrilling. But I was very wrong.

""Darkness"" has very weak characters that are not at all like-able. The mom is oblivious to all things happening around her, the day is slightly crazy, and the teenage girl is the only fairly normal one. Some of the characters have no point in the story, and altogether, they are very underdeveloped. At the end of the movie, I didn't even remember the mother's name..

In addition to the weak characters, I felt the plot was rather pointless and not at all scary. The very first scene makes you think the movie will be interesting....but it's not. Nothing in this movie is described in any detail--nothing is elaborated. There are absolutely no pop-outs or scary scenes..just ongoing awkwardness that makes little sense which ends in a very unsatisfying {and slightly confusin} conclusion.

The movie had an interesting idea {if better explained} but it could have been made _much_ better if only it had a deeper plot with detailed characters.  Altogether, I would not recommend this movie.. save your money and time and go for a different film.",1122854400,,1235,4.951690821256038

1507158,5,B00005JNBN,"Speaking as a veteran of many horror films, I find myself unable to comprehend the low ratings this film receives.  My only regret about watching Darkness is the fact that I saw the rated rather than the unrated version.  The film is a little less than perfect, but it is, without question, one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.  In my opinion, Jaume Balaquero is the most exciting horror director working today.  Like The Nameless, Darkness is a visual masterpiece of cinematography - although Balaquero probably tried a little bit too hard with this film.  All of the random visuals are a little overdone, the movie drags a little longer than it should have for maximum effect, and the ending is - most unfortunately - far too ambiguous, but Balaquero knows horror - how to approach it and how to present it.

It's amazing how effective the haunted house motif still remains - as long as it's done right, incredible things are possible.  Apart from the ending, this film is done absolutely right.  The house in question here is inherently evil and most definitely haunted - although, as in real life, the greatest dangers to the innocent are men with evil in their hearts.  Forty years ago, six children disappeared, but one escaped - although he could not remember enough to help the cops catch the evildoers.  Now, forty years later, a family has moved into the gloomy house where the crimes took place - but only the children sense the danger lurking there.  Young Paul retreats within himself and begins showing unexplained bruises around his neck, while teenaged daughter Regina (Anna Paquin) picks up on the evil presence and tries to protect her brother; the parents are less than useless.  Mark, the dad, has some kind of seizure and then begins changing in ways that beg for a straightjacket, and all the while the mom just tells everyone not to worry.  Regina and her boyfriend do some investigating and discover the true history of the house, its evil design and ritualistic intent, but their search takes Regina places she would never have dreamed of going.  It's all pretty much up to her, though, as her parents won't listen to her and poor Paul is helplessly haunted by the ghosts of several evil children.  Darkness comes with a nice little bundle of surprises; not only did the story take a couple of turns I didn't foresee, it had me guessing about other possible surprises.

The cinematography of this film is brilliant and the true secret of its palpable creepiness.  You'll be looking at a dark room and then a lightning strike will silhouette these creepy children just standing there; you've got shadows that move just outside the peripheral vision of characters; and periodic sets of random, disturbing images also contribute greatly to the overall effect.  These latter scenes are used too often in the latter half of the film, but it's a minor quibble at best.  The only thing wrong with the movie is the ending, which is just too ambiguous to satisfy anyone.  Darkness does not have a five-star story, but it's just so incredibly creepy that I cannot give it less than five stars overall.  Anna Paquin proves more than capable of carrying the film single-handedly whenever she needs to.  In my opinion, Darkness ranks right up there among the creepiest horror films made in the last two decades - now I just have to get my hands on the unrated version.",1121212800,8,3386,4.752136752136752

1507161,4,B00005JNBN,"Darkness has all the makings of a great horror thriller. It puts a small family with strained relationships in an old European house and starts toying with them. The usual shadows, hallucinations, and bumps in the night begin. We learn that the people involved in the sale of the house apparently do not exist in the real sense, and nobody is quite what they seem in the end. Why then, does the film seem so flat?

I think the answer lies in a lack of transition. The scenes often seem to fire out at the viewer in a rapid stream, and any reason why we should be frightened or even sympathetic is left hanging in the air. If you're a fan of Anna Paquin, you might get a sense of wanting her character to survive unscathed. The film throws away this element in the end by trying to have a dangling ending and failing.

The main reason I imported this DVD rather than wait for a local version is because it has been around three years since the film was released in theatres and I hadn't heard of it until earlier this year. It is almost as if Dimension want to be bankrupt, or something. To top that off, while the DVD itself is not bad, it is hindered by a few of my favourite annoyances on the format. It seems the idea of using seamless branching to deliver a theatrical cut and a director's unrated edition on the one disc has not caught on. Perhaps the idea of selling the same film on two discs appeals more to the studio. When they do release more than one disc of the same film, one would think they could at least have the decency to include a decent number of chapter stops. You know, that key feature that help make DVD so much less a chore than VHS to watch?

Bottom line, if you are a massive fan of any of the actors in this film, buy it. Otherwise, there are far better horror stories in a visual format that you could buy. Especially at this asking price, which seems more appropriate for a feature-loaded two-disc set.",1120089600,,1934,4.278688524590164

Not with this movie, it would have been better if it made more sense, and had been more original and less cheesy. I don't know about you guys but I'm getting quite tired of haunted house movies. It seems there is a new one every month. There's WAY TOO MANY!! How about some origiality. These writers are getting so so desperate in thinking up original ideas. Because everything has been done in the past already. The old movies are the best like THE SHINING, THE EXORCIST. These screen writers are copy-cating old movie ideas and always fail to make it original. I haven't seen a really good movie in a long time. I'm surprised people still go to theatre's to see these haunted house movies. The screen writers still believe people love em and are still very popular but i think i and many others are gettin' burnt out. They always claim that it will be a ""bone chilling thriller"", ""a nail biting horror"", an edge of your seat thrill, or the funniest one ever ""SCARIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR""! But i never get scared.

I knew darkness wouldnt scare me, but i always give it a chance when a movie comes out and claims to be so terrific and freaky, but no, this on is a thumbs down, like hundreds of others. Give the world a break. When the day comes when a really good horror movie comes to theatre's ""one with originality, creativity, intelligence, and sucessful scare thrills"" i'll be the first one in line.

Worse, what remains is a mish-mash of unoriginal imagry, dialogue and plot twists. The only way a friend and I were able to sit through to the preposterous end was by playing a game in which we shouted out the name of movies - inevitably better - scenes had been pilfered from. If we had turned this into a drinking game, we'd have been unconscious within the first 45 minutes (perhaps mercifully so). I can only imagine that someone involved with the production got their hands on fantastic blackmail material with which to lure Lena Olin (Alias) into this mess. For the most part, her character's actions are incomprehensible and best and reprehensible at worse. Do yourself a favor... skip this one. You'll thank me.",1119830400,5,987,4.846153846153846

I thought this movie would be a lot better, it sounded great and the commercials made it seem like it was a horror movie you would remember. Far from it. This movie was weak in plot, acting and explanations. I still really do not get what the entire film was about. I don't know maybe I missed something but I only got bit and pieces of the whole plot. The plot at first was somewhat strong, then it just crumbled to pieces when it just stopped making sense. As I said, I was lost, grasping in the darkness to get this whole movie. You never do, for the ending cuts off so fast without answering your questions at all and you feel so empty and bitter afterwards. I would not recommend this movie, it was a waste of time. I cannot even truly explain what the movie is about. Just a family that moves into a house and the father all of a sudden turns into Jack Nicholson from the Shining basically every once and awhile and the small boy is constantly being bruised and the daughter and mother feel it's the father doing it when it's really not. It's a lot like the Shining when you really think about it, but definitely not as good. It was more of a drama than anything, a bad drama though. And they try though to shy away from the Shining plot a tad and put in a different occult twist, but you really never understand the new occult twist, so you're just left with a remade but badly done mixture of other haunting movies, the biggest highlight again the Shining. Trust me, watch the Shining instead, it's older but a heck of a lot better and with a more clear plot. The worst part is in the end though, nothing is finished in the film basically. Very incomplete.
I don't really get what's happening with horror films. They're getting pretty bad when it comes to these kind. Directors really need to sit down and think more about horror films, because these new ones are not doing well. It's been a while since I considered any horror film a five star movie, and that's sad.",1119744000,4,2111,4.293233082706767

So much was left unexplained - there were some things that would have been great to develop, but most of them seemed like a good nod to other classics (the shining, rosemary's baby, house, ringu, etc.).

The art direction was great and the tension-builders were nice but they lead nowhere at all.

That was the only scene, in fact, that I recognized as a ""scene"" at all. Then there was the non-stop use of the spooky film plot device where phone conversations end in, ""Mom? Mom!"" and an unexplained disconnection that's supposed to creep us out good, along with a requisite crash of thunder. This movie is a glut of contradictions, blathering dialogue delivered in one-word squawks, jittery strobe shots of meaningless mayhem, a devout evil villain who refers to the All Important Ritual that brings the story together as merely ""the Game,"" and a family with no one in it that the viewer can care about except maybe the little boy, but maddeningly, he never develops beyond the random strobe shot.

My biggest question was, if they moved to spain, how come no one speaks spanish and there are very few spanish accents?  This movie never even made me flinch.  Looking back, I wish we had shut it off.  I am critical of scary movies, but watched it with two friends who are are much more forgiving than I am.

The drawing of the cut slices behind you as the audio expresses a thought which is drawn.

Lena Olin is truly great. In the small featurette, Lena talks about the movie and it is surprising to see and hear her view about the movie.

The movie theatre cut is like a pencil without a tip... ABSOLUTELY NOOOOO POINT. The unrated cut restores the power of the film, and the insidious creepy crawly feel of the power of darkness. Giancarlo is great in this film as well. A truly magnificent part. Chilling in ALL respects.

1507269,3,B00005JNBN,"This is a spoiler-free review of ""Darkness: Unrated Version.""

""Darkness"" isn't nearly as terrible as the critics universally agreed when the film was released in December 2003. It's yet another entry in the ""Haunted House"" subgenre of horror films, and how much you enjoy it depends partly on how familiar you are with this type of film. If you've seen too many of them recently, you'll probably find ""Darkness"" both dull and cliche-ridden. If you haven't, you might find yourself enjoying parts of this film while scratching your head at others. I quite enjoyed much of it.

The strength of the film lies in its minimalistic old-school techniques to send shudder down your spine. Unlike the recent remakes of both ""The Haunting"" and ""The House on Haunted Hill,"" ""Darkness"" doesn't use computer-generated graphics to conjure up demons and ghosts. Rather, it uses clever editing, sound effects and lighting to convey the building paranoia that comes from living in a haunted house. I also liked the idea that the teenaged protagonist Regina (Anna Paquin)is neither a sexpot nor a superheroine. Through most of the film she is realistically resourceful, and geniunely troubled about the many problems her family faces even prior to the hauntings.

On the downside, we have a stereotypical ""European""-style production in which the actors appear to have minimal rehearsal time and are encouraged to improvise their lines. In the hands of a more gifted director, this could be magic but the director is no Rosellini. Almost without exception, the talented crew perform in an exaggerated fashion, perhaps to compensate for lack of direction or perhaps in the vain hope they would strike some sparks. The plot itself is maddening because it's obvious that the germ of a better film is in here but hasn't been uncovered.

""Darkness"" is a fun rental on a rainy Friday night, but I can't imagine anyone wanting to own this unless they are a die-hard affectionato of the genre.",1117756800,3,1967,5.024539877300613
1507270,4,B00005JNBN,"Here what i thought about this movie, in case you are thinking

of buying it. First off, i have to say all these people who

are being critical of this movie are expecting something more

than just a movie, sometimes i think they think the dvd comes with

a massage and a naked chick to boot. Hyper critical

about a good movie, actually a pretty solid movie like this

makes me think that you guys are expecting more that a movie out

of a movie. i mean what is it you want so badly a soul-mystifying

life changing moment? Unfortunatley if you look back at the entire

genre of horror films RARELY, and yes i do mean RARELY,

are they ever really to be re-leased to become a true classic.

I am for this movie, totally i did not expect anything at all

from this movie. Only the vaguest amount of reccolection

of a tv teaser was left in my mind. I was impressed with this film.

First off it had pace, it did not all start out scary at

all it in fact started really light for the first 5 minutes.

For a second you had to think to yourself it was just as innocent

and peachy. This was a brilliant, yes brilliant move on the

move of the writer or dierector, because it set up the contrast

for everything at 1st being a ""sunday afternoon"" or a walk in the park

and then boom a little is revealed through innocense.

It was so well shot the pacing was so perfect the acting...

i could not ask for better actors. this is what you want in a movie

to forget you are watching a movie.

The characters did not even seem to be not trying to be acting

even the smallest kid i wonder how he was able to be so innocent

yet display an arrange of emotions in seemingly total innocence

in acting it was like watching real life. it was weird, but in a

good way. Anyways.. the first time something turns out to be wrong

was in the child being taken to school by his father

and they were talking and the father was making fun of the frustration,

or the place they were which was stcuk in traffic.

the father got his son laughing and they were both laughing'

then boom. this is when the story picks up pace, something happens

through the most unexpected moment, i was like dang!

at this point in the movie the auduence knows something is

defintetly not right in fact something is VERY wrong and not

right at all. Then they go back into pace, everythings normal

and then these odd things start happening. little signs

just to remind the audience know SOMETHING IS WRONG.

The second time something happens the little kid is coloring with

crayons alone in his room. again the most innocent of

times to choose for something to happen.

Then it gets really dark, people who i will go unnamed start

acting very peculiar i mean really peculiar. From here the

movie becomes fleshed out and the story enfolds.

Most of it in rain and darkness.

The movie does get intense at times, at times i was like

wow OH MY GOD! There are these things in the movie that were

so wicked they make me want to jump out my skin, the thing

when they were on the train was like a living nightmare.

It looked like an evil evil evil lady qith dark patches for

her eyes om man you gotta see this crap.

If i were you i would buy this film for sure, a lot of films

come out and they are like period pieces.. this one is hard to

tell if it came out in the 80 or 90's you know it was not

the kind of movie that was bears any sign ""o"" the times.

it was really original. My only problem was i wish they would

come out with an EXTENDED CUT. Or that certain facts given

in the film had become more explored. If there is any fault in

this movie it's that you want to know more about about the

cover up the ritual to banish the darkness.

By the way Anna Paquin i believe her name is was casted so

perfectly, i don't even like her i know her from x-men and thats

it. but she was so perfect for this, the son adam i think his name was..

the dad WOW, he reminded me of the lead character from the shinning for a

moment he held nothing back, what a great way to express yourself on film,

the mom at the end of the film so PERFECT from this part!~

I guess i cannot hide

that i like this film, not anywhere

especially in the darkness. (special features were really lacking)",1117756800,,4260,4.129742962056303
1507271,2,B00005JNBN,"This is another case of a beautifully done film falling way below expectations because of a weak script.  The cinematography, set design, lighting is all wonderful.  The acting, such as the script allows, is also pretty good.  The script however leaves much to be desired.

There really isn't a plot other than the standard - House bad.  House wants to eat you. House wins because of stupidity of actors.  And the only time you have any sort of clue as to what is going on is when one of the actors gives a speech (thank you Mr. Exposition).

1507272,2,B00005JNBN,"I gave it two stars because it has atmosphere.  And that's all it has.  They could have at least written the script before they started shooting the movie--some scenes are obviously ad-libbed, the actors and actresses hoping it would come out looking original.  Not close and certainly no cigar.

What we see here is the enraging waste of a potentially effective horror film.  I am proud to say I did not choose to rent this myself.  It was a negotiation gone horribly, horribly wrong.  When I saw the cover and read the plot I knew what to expect, and that is more or less what I got.

Okay guys, make sure you've seen other horror movies, or you won't be able to connect the feeling of stunning unoriginality that drips from this sad little attempt at creepiness: ""The Omen"", ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""The

Sixth Sense"", blah blah blah.  In order to understand the subplots see every stale, Lifetime TVish type excuse for a drama ever.  Read some August Derleth; not H.P. Lovecraft.

The plot is Spooky is as Spooky does; a family moves into a large mansion in which something TRAGIC HAPPENED ONCE! Six children disappeared.  One escaped though.  Lo and behold, we have a morbid little tyke named Paul in the family moving in with the rest of the household.  Foreshadowing, anyone?

The young teenage daughter, Regina, is unhappy with the move away from the states.  (Where the hell ARE these people, anyway?) She is delicate, pale and sickly, ergo made to be in gruesome situations where she becomes the affectionate heroine suddenly pulling through her veil of shyness.  The husband, Mark, is a nutcase who shouldn't be a free man anyway; abusing people and behaving so strangely that we wonder how he came to father children in the first place, with so much medication and all.  The mother is a debonaire, annoying woman who has no interest whatever in what's going on, only affecting an air of sophistication.

The important one, of course, is Regina. She discovers through a weird old handicapped man that the house was once employed by cultists for the use of human sacrifice, namely children, and that she should get the ever scribbling young Paul out of the house as quickly as possible.  He has been obsessed with this case for years, but conveniently has done nothing about it till now.

There is a diabolical old man who tries to allow Paul to be killed, of course.  There is a struggle.  SOME scenes gave me a jump, but not many.  And during the whole course of the film I was thinking of every horror movie I'd ever seen that had done it better.

1507276,1,B00005JNBN,"I normally don't rush online to write a review, but I just finished watching this movie and had to do it. This the only thing horrific about this movie is the story and the characters.

The movie tries to wind slow tension by making Paquin walk from room to room at the slowest possible speed. It tries to draw cheap jumps with the not-so-subtle use of sudden booming music. Both tricks failed miserably.

The mother comes off as inept, the father comes off as a pathetic idiot who has no idea what's going on. The son looks like the posterboy for Ritalin, and surprise, the only one who has a firm grasp on the situation is the adolescent, over-dramatic, daughter.

Like a compulsive gambler, I forced myself to watch the whole movie to see if the ending would be somehow worth it.

The explanation for what is happening is beyond feeble. It looked like the writers got stuck for a solution and threw this garbage at the audience hoping it would fly.

Hell, I would have settled for the house being built on an old burial ground instead of the sludge they fed me.

1507319,3,B00005JNBN,"""Darkness"" is a paradox. On one hand the film achieves a primal terror, and it has sequences that are much scarier than most of the horror crap being turned out these days. At least this movie was not named after a bodily fluid and didn't star that ""7th Heaven"" kid. On the other hand, the movie could be better, and some parts tend to feel artificial and drag. Now normally when reviewing a horror movie, I don't mark it down for artificialness, but this feels really, really fake. Now, I didn't catch this movie in the theaters, but I thought I would rent it to see if it was as bad as critics said. I wasn't expecting much, and perhaps that's why I didn't mind it, but I only expect alot from movies I have been waiting to see for a while, like ""White Noise"" (terrible) or ""The Aviator"" (pretty good). This movie is not a Speilberg movie or even a Brian Singer film. The movie, putting it frankly, is good and effectively frightening, but it is unoriginal to the tenth degree. Shadows of ""The Shining"" and ""Se7en"" are present throughout the moie, and of course there is the requisite scene where the troubled teenage daughter has to make a decision that may or may not hurt a loved one. After the halfway point, the movie loses its feel of a more independant, low budget film and takes horror full circle. This may be good for some people, but others, like me, will think the change is too abrupt.

The PG-13 rated movie has parts that will make you say ""This is SOO PG-13"", like the scene where the father bangs on his sons door yelling and freaking this and frigging you and fricking that. The three times the f-word is used is used towards a repair man, and I couldn't help thinking that they should have used their limited supply towards the son, so that the scene would not have sounded so goofy. Althought the DVD boasts ""shocking unrated footage"", the whole thing in its entirety is not that shocking. The only thing actually added from the theatrical release is that the blade performing the tracectomy is scene going into the cadavers throat, and no blood is even seen! Well, actually a little is. We see the blade enter the throat and a drop of blood. Shocking. And it looks so fake it could be a cartoon. From what I've read, the DVD is just a ploy to get people to buy it since it was somewhat of a theatrical flop. I heard somewhere that the traceotomy scene is on the DVD just as it was in the PG-13 version, and that the only thing changed is the tiny drop of blood. Believe me, the only reason this DVD is ""unrated"" is because without that subtitle it would just have a slightly changed content description on the back of the box. Currently it is rated PG-13 for ""Disturbing Images, Intense Terror Sequences, Thematic Elements, And Language"", the DVD should be rated PG-13 for ""Violence, Disturbing Images, Terror, Thematic Content, And Language"". I have no clue what thematic elements are, but they must be something to do with sex or something. I'm just kidding of course about the sex thing, but I have no clue what they are.

When ""Darkness"" first starts out, it looks promising. It starts with a kid being interviewed about a ritual that he escaped from narrowly. The entire sequence is intercut with images (and they're disturbing, too!) of kids being chased by sinister looking people in cloaks. A disadvantage of the film is that many things happen in the 102 minutes that this movie runs, but alot of the things that happen have no explanation to how they are connected. The scene with the father and son in the car when the father has the first seizure goes on for about ten minutes, but it only needed a two minute setup. Eight minutes are spent on the father honking his horn and getting the other drivers mad at him. All the horn honking gave me a headache.

""Darkness"", although better than expected, has been getting made for five decades. Perhaps that is why it was delayed almost three years. For every stupid part, there is a scary one, and for every plot hole there is an explanation for another question that was raised. Half this movie is spent sitting around watching the power go out, and it gets old after about the tenth time the power dies. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheesecake. It's hard to get through, and when it's over you don't want much more. The Spanish countryside stereotyping doesn't work well either. The movie tries to be beautiful and picturesque, but it comes off as half-hearted and hackneyed.

The plot of the movie revolves around a ritual performed in 1962 during the solar eclipse. It involved seven children being slaughtered to free the evil inside of them, and although the movie never makes it clear, I believe it was some sort of Satanic thing. Flash forward forty years later. Regina (Anna Paquin) has just moved into the house that the rituals were performed in along with her family, mother Maria (Lena Olin), father Mark (Iain Glenn), and brother Paul (Stephan Enquist). They of course do not know about the ritual, and they are soon the prey of the stirring ghosts that still inhabit the house. The movie requires quite a leap of faith in terms of the plot, as one of the members of the family (I will not say who), has come back from the sixties and now lives in the house as part of the family (they are the kid that escapes). The moie asks us to believe this and the plot twist that leads up to it, but I don't buy it.

At the 80 minute mark, when the climax starts, people are worn out (I know I was) because the movie kind of catapults us into the action and the violence without checking back with the characters. The movie has some flaws, but it is good and scary for the most part. Even a scene where the ghost kids call Regina and tell her they are watching her and call her a bitch, while funny that they have no reason to call her that, and also because it's always funny to hear kids swear (especially girl scouts, like in ""Dodgeball""). What the movie needed was a larger amount of action and not just cram 20 minutes of it into the end. A good movie all in all, but it could have ended in a clearer way, and perhaps it was a sequel setup, but I was unconvinced.

1507395,1,B00005JNBN,"""We are watching you, b*tch."" - a stranger calls Regina when the power goes out leaving her helpless & in total ""Darkness""

Idiotic, assinine film, ""Darkness"" is a film that should never have really seen the light of day, production wise that is.

Strange things start to happen to a family when they move into an old house in Spain. The families young son is scared of the dark telling his older sister, Regina, that things are different in this new house than back home. The father has a mental condition, sort of a physical version of Terets, breaking loose & going beserk when he gets a bit to stressful (or is it the guy is just a psycho to begin with?). The mother (played by Lena Olin) is an idiot, plain & simple, not listening to her son when he tells her of the odd goings on about the house.

Things start to get really weird when Regina starts to dig up the truth about the house, finding out that the house was a house of demonic worship in the past, that is somehow linked to her Grandfather, a reputable doctor who lured the family to Spain in the first place.

""Darkness"" is far from illuminating any classic scares or chills.

The film has enough plotholes to make Swiss Cheese envious. First off, there is no way that a family can move into a house that has no record, or history of being built. Said property would be in the hands of the city, town, or state that the house resides in with the local government seeing fit as to what to do with said house. Two, the father for all of his ranting & raving should have been put in an asylum for intensive examination (the guy was bordering on the psychotic!).

I could go on all day long, but due yourself a favor, see the light and avoid this ""Darkness"".",1115337600,2,1721,4.312693498452012
1507396,3,B00005JNBN,"Forty years ago, something awful happened at the house.  One child escaped, too traumatized to remember anything.  The others were never found.

Now an American family moves into the Spanish country estate, which is plagued by unexplainable electrical problems.  Then more frightening things begin to occur.  Teenaged Regina (Anna Paquin - X-MEN) immediately suspects that something is wrong with the house.  Her little brother is making disturbing drawings in his sketchbook, and bruises have appeared on his body with no discernible cause.  Her mother (Lena Olin - ROMEO IS BLEEDING) believes there is a mundane explanation and writes her daughter's behavior off as normal teen angst, and in any case she has her hands full with her husband, whose previously dormant mental illness is resurfacing.  Objects move by themselves; specters lurk in the shadows.

Yes, it's pretty clich in a lot of ways.  The script isn't particularly sharp, and there's some terrible acting by the actor who plays the father.  What saves it is its very stylish direction and a thoroughly convincing performance by Paquin.  (Her fans will want to see this film regardless, as she is front and center for the entire picture - emphasis on the ""front."")  I liked the film's subtlety and deliberate pacing, and its, ah, dark ending.  A nice twist (no, they're not all dead) and a few chills here and there, too.

Extras on the DVD include a brief (under four minutes) behind-the-scenes featurette, as well as trailers for this film, SIN CITY and CURSED.

DARKNESS sat on the shelf for a couple years before finally being released to theatres under the radar in 2004.  I don't think it deserved this fate, as much worse movies have been brought out without any kind of delay.  It's somewhat derivative but has enough redeeming aspects to make it worth watching.",1115251200,5,1836,4.983552631578948

I love seeing how directors will scare the audience, and how they will incorporate a good story line with it.  But then I saw ""Darkness"".  I was disappointed when I first saw this movie.  First off I assumed the movie was scary because of the name and the many movie trailers I see on television.  Second, the plot of the movie dept jumping and I got lost somewhere, and yet the ending didn't end, it continued into a dark hole.

1507398,2,B00005JNBN,"In terms of its storyline, ""Darkness"" is pretty much like every other haunted house movie ever made.  We start off with the usual unsuspecting family of four who find themselves knee deep in ghouls and ghosts the moment they move into their new residence (the family is American and the home is in Spain in this outing).  Of course, anyone in his right mind would hightail it out the door two seconds after setting foot in the house - but not this group!  They want to hang around to see what ""happens.""  It is Oscar-winner Anna Paquin, as the moody but perceptive teenaged daughter of the clan, who gets to have her name above the title here - a dubious distinction at best, I'm sorry to say.

""Darkness"" has just about all the standard accoutrements one would expect to find in a film on this subject.  In addition to the perpetual thunderstorm taking place outside and the electricity that keeps going out on cue, we also have the self-activating toys, the strange voices on the telephone, the ghostly images on photographs, the father who becomes exponentially more psychotic in every scene in which he appears, and the mysterious old man with the limp who shows up out of nowhere and seems to hold the key to everything.  Seasoned veterans will be able to predict just about every hackneyed setup and clich a full hour before it officially arrives on screen.  For instance, we just know, without room for quibble, that the minute the mother brings home a box of colored pencils for her delighted little boy to play with, the tyke will start drawing strange and disturbing pictures to help push the plot points along.  It's practically de rigueur when it comes to films in this vein.  (However, I must say, in all fairness, that the movie does NOT include the cat-jumping-out-at-the-audience scene, which is pretty much standard issue for every horror flick these days.  The filmmakers DO earn some bonus points for that).

Paquin makes for a feisty heroine, and it isn't really her fault that her character always seems to be ten giant steps behind the audience in figuring it all out.  And as to the ""What the *&$%?"" ending - well, it's either so brilliant that it is beyond the ken of mere mortal man to figure out, or it's one of the biggest final curtain stumbles in horror movie history.  I have my own personal notion as to which of those two it really is, but I`ll let you figure that one out for yourself.  After all, I have to leave you with SOMETHING interesting to do while you're watching this film.",1115078400,,2516,4.609865470852018
1507399,2,B00005JNBN,"I really wanted to like this movie. Haunted House movies are always fun if they're creepy.  The story is extremely stupid. Filmed in Spain by a Spanish director and crew I assume to save money ala Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti westerns. How they rangled Anna Paquin in to this is a mystery to me. There are some interesting moments that are creepy but nothing you haven't seen before. This film fits nicely among films like The Grudge.

It looks good but that alone can't carry this film.

The grandfather, the mom and the father all do fairly decent acting jobs, but i never bought anna, and i really have enjoyed her in other films.

All in all, something decent to watch, nothing too graphic or gruesome if kids happened to see it...and nothing really scary if watching movies ruins your sleep=)",1114992000,,562,4.446601941747573
1507453,2,B00005JNBN,"When one sees the blurb ""un-ratred edition"" one naturally assumes that there will be some content of a far more intense or gory nature than there was in the theatrical version.  Not having seen the theatrical version I'm at a loss as to what exactly the ""un-rated"" was supposed to be, because I didn't see it.  Maybe it was that the tracheotomy scene was longer or more graphic.  Whoopee...if I wanted to see surgery I'd watch The Learning Channel or something.  Honestly if this version was supposed to be more intense then the theatrical version had to be a real snoozer.

The Director/writer Jaume Balaguero obviously had the Horror 101 playbook in use as there is almost nothing in this movie that hasn't been borrowed from other horror films.  You'll see plot devices borrowed from Amityville Horror, Darkness Falls, The Others, The Ring, Six Sense, and who knows how many other films.  We have the father who is slowly being driven mad by the house...we have the little boy who is drawing disturbing pictures in crayon...we have things that zoom past doorways just out of view...

The story, what there is of it concerns a family that moves from the states to a creepy old house in the Spanish Countryside.  Maybe I blinked, but I never did hear the reason for the radical move other than they had to be in THAT house for a reason and the director is Spanish.  Soon after creepy things happen and only the daughter Regina (Anna Paquin) seems to notice what's happening.  her little brother Paul keeps showing up with bruises on him yet the idiot mother Maria (Lena Olin) passes it off as ""these things happen"".  yeah right...they happen if you live with a child abuser...

Dad Mark (Iain Glen) starts going all George Lutz on the family, suffering seizures and generally being abusive to the family members, while little brother Paul is the one being tormented in his bedroom by a toy carrousel that goes on by itself (another Horror cliche) and a pencil that always rolls under his bed....OOhhhhh Scary!  Dan busts a hole in the wall and finds an old victrola and listens to old records and puts up a creepy photograph of 3 old ladies wearing sunglasses.  Every one in a while we get a quick glimpse of something creeping around like the girl from the Ring but it's never explained.

There's some mumbo jumbo about how the house was really built to match a temple (of what I have no idea) and a spell which requires seven children to be killed to bring ""Darkness"" about.  Again, it's never really explained because the director obviously thought we'd be too creeped out to ask questions.  Ultimately it's just silly as is the usual cliched horror film ending which could not come soon enough.  If this film had come out five years ago it might not have been bad, but seeing how almost everything in it is liberally borrowed from other films it just comes off very weak.  I'll give it two stars on the strentgh of Paquin's performance who at least seemed to be giving it an effort.

Oh, and finally it's one of the cheapest DVDs of a new release in a long time.  All you get for special features is a couple of trailers and a FOUR minute featurette on the making of the film.  It's obvious that the guys who made this film knew what a clunker it was and were not going to spend any more money by adding special features.",1114992000,2,3326,4.552941176470588

Anna Paquin is fine, as is Lena Olin and Iain Glen. I don't know the name of the young son, but he was great. I hate bad kid actors; he was very fine.

For toppers, why and what is the DARKNESS?  Why did seven people sacrifice their children for it?  What were they trying to accomplish?  And as talented as Giancarlo Giannini may be considered, why was he given the crux of the story's plot when he has such a thick accent that unless you turn on the subtitles, you have no idea what he's talking about.

1507459,3,B00005JNBN,"DARKNESS is a movie struggling under the burden of an impossibly puerile script.  Had the writer Fernando de Felipe and director/writer Jaume Balaguer taken a bit more time to develop the underlying basis for this Gothic suspense excursion into night they may have had a stronger result.  As it is the reasons for all of the occult intervention in a strange house somewhere in Spain comes in bits and pieces and ultimately seem barely interesting and silly.

Mark (Iain Glen), his wife Maria (Lena Olin) and their two children Regina (Anna Paquin) and Paul (Stephan Enquist) move into an old house unoccupied for forty years, a house that has problematic electricity and water and odd sounds that go bump in the night.  The family's doctor/grandfather Albert Rua (Giancarlo Giannini) appears at times when the family needs support and in this new home those times proliferate.  Mark is afflicted with a disease called 'Harrington Syndrome' which causes episodes of wild behavior supposedly controlled by meds which nurse wife Maria administers.  Paul is the most frightened or sensitive to the bizarre occurrences that happen only in the dark: he gains strange bruises, sees darkened children, notices movements and other nocturnal scaries.  Regina is the comfort to Paul and believes the 'delusions' his father and mother deny and seeks help from a local lad Carlos (Fele Martnez)  who researches the house and discovers that it was built by an architect (a man who stalks the house at night) who informs Carlos that the house was built for strange reasons: a ritual occurred forty years ago involving the death of six children (meant to be seven but one escaped).  It is only with the death of that seventh child at the hands of one who loves him that the curse will be lifted.

Yes, this is really the tale...how this disintegrating family comes to grips with the dark history and demands of the house and who is to be the seventh 'child' is the gist of the story.  Had the writers given us more perhaps we would care more, but with so many threads of unexplained twists and turns the suspense fails to peak.  The actors, having such poor material from which to work, stumble through the tale without gaining our concern or support.

The saving grace of this outing is in the moody cinematography by Xavi Gimnez: the look of the film is excellent enough to justify simply turning off the sound track to allow your imagination to make a story out of the visuals.  And to add insult to injury the closing lines of this unresolved 'story' seem to open the door for a sequel, heaven forbid!  Grady Harp, April 05",1114819200,2,2611,4.783964365256125

The ending is kind of abrupt and remains somewhat open, but you still know what happens to the characters in the end. Luckily, and somewhat unfortunately, the script didn't allow for enough character development for you to become too fond of the characters before the end of the movie.

Numerous times the Anna Paquin character could have done something simple to stop ""The Darkeness"" (including using a flashlight at times). In fact, all the characters act like they are on Ecstasy. And why would the police not know about this house??

1507494,3,B00005JNBN,"Ever since the success of Re-Animator launched his career as a horror film producer, Brian Yuzna has remained independent and to keep it that way he's gone from making his movies in the United States to Europe where it costs less. His latest effort is Darkness, made in Spain only to be acquired and promptly buried by Dimension Films for two years before a low-key theatrical release with cuts to make it more accessible. It has finally been released on DVD in an uncut form.

Director Juame Balaguero wisely creates a foreboding sense of dread early on and never lets up. For example, Regina returns home from school on a rainy night and spots a mysterious figure in the darkness. It's a brief shot but creepy nonetheless. He uses fleeting, sudden jolts of disturbing imagery. Shadowy figures flash by the camera as he messes with our perception and imagination. As befitting the title, the director plays around with the absence of light, with shadows and with what we can't see. There's a scene where a character walks down a hallway that becomes darker and darker until he is engulfed by the darkness. It is one of the film's most striking images.

Balaguero thankfully eschews a trendy young cast of TV actors from UPN or the WB in favour of someone like Paquin who plays a smart and resourceful young woman who is by no means a shrinking violet. The only glaring clich that Darkness resorts to is the old chestnut where the bad guy explains his master plan thereby giving our heroine enough time to escape. Otherwise, this film is a nice alternative to formulaic movies like Cursed and the upcoming House of Wax remake.

""Darkness Illuminated: Behind the Scenes of Darkness"" features brief clips of the director and the cast with clips from the movie. In this day and age of CGI-heavy movies, it is nice to see that Balaguero created many of the film's effects in camera.

If ""Darkness"" had been made 15 years ago it would be considered one of the best horror movies of it's time.  Now it just can't compete.

Some camera movements and night scenes are ok but that's it. And I think you can see the dolly tracks in one very short take!,1114214400,,258,3.980769230769231

Hm.  This is actually a dificult question to answer after viewing this horrible excuse of a movie.  The beggining was very abrupt, and left you with a feeling like they didn't finish that up.  It just flashed a bunch of clips of kids running, and the house and the title appeared.  Along with the cast.  And then, it moved on to the beggining.  With the family all happy 'cause they've got their new house down in Spain.  Well, for some unexplained reason, the main guy (I forgot everyone's names it was so bad) has a wierd seizure-type-thing in his car in the middle of traffic.  Could this be linked to the ghosts that inhabit that house?!?!

This film is abundant with pointless scenes.  Like, the one I like to call 'the girl-in-the-wheel-chair scene'.  That scene had no explanation to it.  AT ALL.  If you view this piece of crap, you will know what I am talking about.  There were generic scare scenes that obviously weren't scary in the least, and they were pretty laughable too.  Like, the scene where that old man is trying to escape the ever-growing darkness in a building.  SCARY.  OH MAN.  Some of the lines in the film were laughable near the end, and had the entire theater cracking up.  Oh man.  Just...no.  NO.  It also had an abrupt ending aswell as an abrupt beggining, and it left the audience booing and flipping the screen off.  I've never seen anything like that in the theater happen, even during The Nutty Professor 2, which was pretty bad.  But, this just seems like something Uwe Boll would make.  That's why I'm comparing it to House Of The Dead.  They are both about as bad.  I would truely give this 0 stars if I could.  HORRIBLE.",1113782400,2,1685,4.523333333333333

7940262,2,B00005JNBN,"Family moves into old house.  I know they're a family because the movie told me so.  If it had told me they were a randomly chosen group of strangers, I would have believed that too.  ""Mom"" is detached, appearing only to want to maintain the proper distance between herself and the riff-raff she is compelled to associate with.  ""Dad"" is a goofy, but touchy acquaintance staying for awhile and trying to fit in, but everyone is wishing he would just leave.  ""Daughter"" is the hired caregiver who takes her job seriously and wants to do well so she'll get good references.  ""Son"" is bland and generic with toddler-level drawing skills.

House is haunted.  I know this because movie showed me some fleeting figures, lights flickering, a toy starting by itself, doors closing & locking people in, etc. (just continue with every haunted house indicator you've seen at least a dozen times each).

House has tragic history.  That's easy, because there's a couple of old guys in the movie.  Plus, ""Daughter""  goes to library and looks at old book.  We see old newspaper clippings.  Creepy old picture of creepy old folk is found by ""Dad"" & he cottons to it right away.  Scenes of old-timey kids running around.  Etc. again.

OK, stage is set.  Now tell me, movie, I can't wait!  What's going on?

What do you mean, you don't know?  But wait, come back--you've still got a couple of characters and some scenes that haven't been used.  What do we do with them? -- Hey, movie!  Hey!  --Oh! movie has left.

7940266,5,B00005JNBN,"This movie is fantastic. I have no idea why this got such bad reviews. It seems like this one is a love to hate movie. It's not typical in terms of American horror these days. It's supernatural, psychological, and a slow burn kind of film. There isn't much blood at all either. And it's obviously a haunted house movie.

A lot of the complaints are silly. ""Oh noes! It's a haunted house!"" They didn't try to hide that. ""Oh noes! It has ghosts! So cliche!"" It's a haunted house movie. Duh. ""Some of it takes place at night when the power fails."" Is there any horror movie in existence that has absolutely no darkness to it? Horror movies and lights going out at some point are hand in hand. ""Nothing happens!"" By way you mean people aren't getting killed after other minute? It's a slow burn. What do you expect?

If you like your movies bloody and have an attention span of a fruit fly, don't watch this movie. You will be disappointed. This isn't Saw.",1507248000,2,952,4.403409090909091

7940269,5,B00005JNBN,"I saw this in theaters years ago. I loved it then, and I really love it now. Not sure where all the hate is coming from, but maybe that's just because I'm getting old (lol). There's plenty of scary movies out there. The ""hack and chop"" 90's led into the torture and obscene we see today. Like I said, I'm getting older... never thought I'd see the day when I would use the word ""obscene"". Anyways, this movie has a very original story, and my five star rating is for the ORIGINAL idea. How many movies now a days are just cheap-o rip offs from past flicks, especially when it comes to horror. No... you won't see Anna Paquin eviscerated, raped, tortured, or screaming for her life. If that's what your looking for, look somewhere else. If you want to see a movie that uses original artistic thriller quality both with the soundtrack and with the plot, this is your ticket.
