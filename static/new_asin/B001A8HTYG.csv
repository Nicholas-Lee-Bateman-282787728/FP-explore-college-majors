3446271,4,B001A8HTYG,"There is a lot missing from this Israeli film, making it less than perfect, in my view.

The film is set in 2000, the year of Israel's sudden and unplanned exit from southern Lebanon. At the outset, Lt. Liraz Liberti (Oshri Cohen) expresses his intense frustration at commanders planning to abandon the Crusader fort Israel captured in 1982 in order to halt 34 years of Lebanese bombardments of northern Israeli towns. The Israeli characters are all sympathetic.

Unfortunately, however, the film never delineates the defensive success of Israel's 1982 invasion of southern Lebanon. Nor does it mention Israeli lives saved, and 18 years of bombardments prevented.

Viewers do learn that the Four Mothers, a group of passivist parents whose sons died in southern Lebanon, are pressuring the nation to stop defending northern Israel---and even halt defense of Israeli outposts there until the Israel Defense Forces can safely evacuate its men. They therefore see the senseless deaths of two Israeli recruits, bomb sapper Zvi (Ohad Knoller)---whose uncle died within 50 meters of him in the initial 1982 assault---and Zitlawy (Itay Turgeman), a talented musician shelled at the outermost guard post. They also witness Oshri (Eli Altonio) apparently lose his arm at the same post.

Determined to glorify peace at all costs, the film makers offer no explanation whatever for the murderous rage of the unseen Hezbollah terrorists shelling Beaufort. They devote the entire film to exposing the futility of war, although in some instances self defense is vital.

The Beaufort troops' frustrated inability to respond to Hezbollah rockets, and their commanders' leaving them in an unconscionable position, however, is palpable. This is all in the way of making IDF commanders look like fools. As this story is framed, it makes eminent sense that Liraz finally relieves Emilo (Itay Schor) of his duty at Beaufort's so-called Green post and even revels in ordering Meir (Danny Zahavi) to set the fuse to destroy the Beaufort bunker system Israeli troops inhabited for 18 years.

What's missing is the build-up of Hezbollah arms and forces in southern Lebanon following Israel's 2000 withdrawal, not to mention the 2006 Hezbollah invasion of northern Israel, their kidnapping and murder of two IDF troops on border patrol and their effective destruction of both Christianity and secular democracy in Lebanon.",1228003200,6,2395,5.2894736842105265
3446272,3,B001A8HTYG,"A very interesting film, if not a particularly stirring one. It focuses on the last days of the Israeli occupation of Lebanon, similar to Vietnam for the US, more or less endless with no ability to actually win in any meaningful way at this stage of the game. The soldiers are dug into the heights around the Crusader fort Beaufort. Everyone knows they're leaving, but politics precludes them from evacuating immediately. So, they're just up there as sitting ducks, albeit well armored, fortified ducks, taking incoming mortar rounds, with no ability to fire back or do much of anything beyond keeping their heads down. Fear mixed with boredom, and a big dose of frustratation is pretty much the story, as they never actually see the enemy or fire a single round back, but hang on to do their duty until they can leave. You'll enjoy the film if you're interested in the subject matter or at least familiar with the war, but for many this will prove dull.",1226534400,13,954,4.684523809523809
3446273,3,B001A8HTYG,From a history perspective I found the story to be interesting. From a theatrical viewpoint I found the acting to be good but the directing left a lot to be desired.

3446274,5,B001A8HTYG,"A small contingent of Israeli Defense Force soldiers defend an ancient fortress outpost in southern Lebanon.  Based on the book by Ron Leshem , ""Beaufort"" depicts long stretches of boredom and tedium are interrupted by terrifying mortar and rocket attacks from Hezbollah.

After years of ""symbolic:"" occupation of this elevated redoubt, Israeli higher-ups decide to abandon the post.  The soldiers find themselves having to conquer their own fears and doubts about the wisdom of what they are doing, subsuming their own desires in order to follow orders and execute a mission given to them.

The role of the occupation force - especially defending a static location - is no picnic; a timely message for our day...

One of THE BEST war movies I have ever seen!",1225497600,2,759,4.992063492063492
3446275,4,B001A8HTYG,"This Israeli film captures some of the deep ambiguities of the novel it is based on but must struggle with the challenge of externalizing a story that is mostly internal, told in the novel by its central character in a rich flood of thought occupying his brain as he deals with the impossibilities of the military situation he and his men have been thrust into. Also problematic, the camera robs the characters of their youth, as the actors portraying them are not really young enough to convincingly play 18-to-20 year olds. Meanwhile, the individual personalities of the young men, the humor, adolescent angst, quirkiness, and youthful playfulness, disappear behind the layers of protective gear they must wear 24/7. The one advantage of this film version of the story is that you can see the layout of the installation - a warren of narrow reinforced passageways - as well as the panoramic views from its mountaintop location.

If you have read the novel and want to relive the experience, relishing again a Catch-22 vision of warfare, this film may be a disappointment. For the most part, it tells its story straight, and stripped to the novel's fairly simple plot line, there is much less to enjoy. Missing in particular is the wild, absurd, often raunchy humor of the novel - the wacky carry-on of Zitlawi especially. Outtakes from the film, which are included on the DVD, suggest that the filmmakers tried to get cinematically out of the box - the men searching outside the fort for the body of a slain comrade, or bathing together in a stream - but the decision seems to have been to maintain the claustrophobia by keeping the action inside the walls of the fort as mortars randomly fall around them, fired by an unseen enemy. For Israeli viewers, this has every potential of symbolizing the nation's hold on an embattled piece of earth at the cost of maintaining a defense force that militarizes a large percentage of its own youth. It raises what must be uncomfortable questions.

Still, it's one of the best and most ambitious Israeli films I've ever seen. Its two hours take you to a time and place that represent what is often missing in news coverage. But read the book.",1224288000,12,2184,4.759894459102902

Acting was real good and the subtitles did not bother or interfere with the message which was the futility of the capturing and keeping of the old crusader fort in the Lebanon war. There were also reference to how politicians and higher ups are incompetent and oblivious to the suffering of the soldiers who often have to suffer from their superiors removed stupidity.

Everyone concerned with the possibly painful future of Israel might ponder this movie, while those who primarily seek a deep war movie will find a deep satisfaction.

Seemingly no strategic value, this guardpost is becoming the target of constant harrassments from unseen enemies. Still, soldiers are dying for seemingly senseless objectives. Just when you think you would be attached to a character, just when he is becoming a human being with memories, dreams and fallacies, there is a sudden, unexpected climax and he is gone. One may expect an IED to blow up even when a dog can walk around it without triggering explosion, but getting hit by an American made anti tank missile while cooking breakfast at a guardpost is just shockingly surprising. Even heroic volunteering ends up with tragedy and it is only too ironic that after the withdrawal the Israelis themselves blow up the very same fort they were painstakingly fortifying with concrete just not very long before.

""Beaufort"" (127 min., originally released in 2006) is a gritty and tough Israeli military drama set on the Beaufort hill in Lebanon, which Israel occupied in 1982. The movie chronicles the last few weeks and days of that occupation, following the Israeli soldiers as they prepare to leave while at the same time enduring the mortars and firing from the Hizbollah around them. The movie's overall theme reminded me of both ""Apocalyse Now"" (the absurdity of war) and ""Das Boot"" (the close confines of living in such conditions). A sense of doom is all over the movie, even though in the end, the last remaining soldiers escape (albeit not after losing several in the last days in battle). I thought this was an engrossing movie from star to finish, and highly recommend it. Easy to see why this was nominated for a Best Foreign Movie Oscar.

As mentioned before, I've been on a roll of Israeli movies, and have generally been surprised/elated by the quality of movies coming from Israel.

Some of the reviewer may be indeed correct that there are geopolitical events that are not portrayed in the film and there may be truth to the idea that the soldiers stationed at the Beufort because of the aggression of the enemy.  But, that is not what this movie is about.
This movie is about the small combat unit under daily enemy fire.  Frustrated, like all soldiers that they cannot go an attack and they cannot pull back.  What is worse, is after they get an order to abandon the Beufort and destroy it, thus making them feel it was all for nothing.
The movie is about the soldiers as they face the abandonment of their mission with out resolution and closure.  You can feel the pain the commander feel as his men are killed by the faceless artillery shells with out being able to do anything but hide in the bunkers.  You feel his gloom s he is told to abandon his position without doing anything heroic or soldier like.
To all those that think the movie forgot the heroes of the war, I would like them to remember that war especially guerrilla or wars of attrition are not glamorous affair lead by ""John Wayne"" types.  This movie was spectacular at what it was meant to portray. If you want unrealistic heroics go rent ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" and watch it over and over, then go enlist.",1271980800,,1680,4.467320261437909

3446340,1,B001A8HTYG,"Most countries rever their national heroes, however, with leftist Israeli filmmakers on the other hand, they insist on making films critical of Israel, and instead of paying homage to their battle victories and the national heroes these wars produced, they focus on the worst about Israel and IDF, and Beaufort is a prime example.

Along with the anti-Israeli biased media, clever Palestinians filmmakers are now successfully destroying Israel's image, winning the hearts and minds of Americans and international audiences with films like Paradise Now which justifies suicide bombings in Israel, and the cunning Amereeka that presents the Palestinians symapthetically, while the Americans and Israelis are mostly evil, doing it with such excellence that it easily succeeds in duping and influencing Americans unfamiliar with the history of Israel/Palestine conflict to hate the Israelis victimizing the wonderful innocent saintly Palestinians (forgetting Palestinian brutal atrocities having raped, torured, murdered, and maimed 100,000 Lebanses Christian civilians during its savage civil war, and thousands of Israeli men, women, and children murdered and maimed since the 1800's).

Watching Israeli soldiers whining in (the technically well made) movie Beaufort was shocking and profoundly disturbing. When I think of Israel and IDF I think of heroic warriors, i.e., legendary Meir Har Zion who fearlessly led his Unit 101 commandos and paratroopers into combat behind enemy lines retaliating for the murder and maiming of Israeli civilians by the ""Fadayeen"" terrorists, and after his sister Shoshana was raped and murdered by Beduins, he went deep into Jordan, tracked those responsible and killed all with the exception of one so he could the story to others; fighter Rafael ""Raful"" Eytan who was woundede several times in combat, including a bullet in the head, yet rose to become the IDF Chief of Staff; the Medal of Courage winner national hero Avi Kahalani who in the 1973 October War, commanding only 72 tank battalion, outnumbered 11-1, he and his men knocked out several hundred enemy tanks, stopping the Syrian invasion on the Golan saving Northern Israel from certain destruction; Arik Sharon who was told by his paratroopers that they'll go through fire and water to fight under his command,  disobayed orders, crossed the Suez Canal forcing the Egyptians to end the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and saving the lives of hundreds of Israeli soldiers; ""Kushi"" Rimon, Ehud Barak, Dan Shomron, Dan Yaron, Yossi Ben Hannan, Yoni Natanyahu, Benjamin Natanyahu, etc., all magnificent Israeli fighters.

In my opinion Beaufort is probably being used by the Hezbollah as part of their training, teaching their men not to fear the IDF soldeirs, who in this film are a bunch of whining Jewish ghetto cry babies, not the Israeli warriors who've defeated the Arab armies in war after war, and have been defeating Palestinian terror.

It's time the Israeli filmmakers learn how to make films from the Arabs and Palestinians sympathetic to their own people instead of making idiotic trash that hurt Israel's image like Beaufort, Lemon Tree, Syrian Bride, Waltzing With Bashir, James Journey to Jerusalem, and Lebanon, the soon to be released film about an Israeli tank crew fighting in the same unpopular 1982 Lebanon War that these Israeli leftist filmmakers love to obsess about. (These filmmakers ignore or forget that the IDF saved the Christian population of Lebanon from total extermination by the Palestinians and their Muslim allies had Israel not come to their rescue, hoping to kick out the PLO and Northern Israel from consistent terror attacks, and hopefully protect a Christian dominated gorvernment friendly to Israel. Unfortunately, pressured by the Arab controlled UN, international biased media, and Israeli leftist politicians, these goals were prevented from being accomplished, resulting in a Lebanon under the radical Islamic Hezbollah control).

Hopefully the bleak, yet humane The Band's Visit, and the powerful 2010 Oscar nominated Ajami herald a new direction for Israli cinema, but this Beaufort, even with an Oscar nomination as Best Foreign Film (I wonder who the arrogant producers who though this crap was better than the much superior The Band's Visit, paid off), is a total boring loser that does not have one character you can indentify with (unless you like weakling whiners and complainers) and therefore I wouldn'd recommend this to anyone who loves or is curious about Israel and its valiant people.",1267747200,8,4528,5.361462728551336

Watch the DVD Extras to get a feel for that:  they constructed an amazing set and then, ummm, deconstructed it (hint, hint) for the film's denouement.

That thought came to an abrupt and stunning halt through a piece of dramatic cinema that Mr. Cedar constructs.  It's a great, unexpected head fake.

3446344,4,B001A8HTYG,"In 1982 on the first day of their controversial invasion of Lebanon, Israeli commandos stormed and captured the Crusader castle of Beaufort which had become a Palestinian fortress. Eighteen years later, as this movie begins, a group of young Israeli soldiers is preparing to leave, bringing the whole unhappy Lebanon adventure to an end.
The filmmakers shot this in another Crusader castle, Kalat Nimrod, on the Golan Heights. Within its walls, they contructed a bewildering rabbit warren of underground passages, reinforced concrete barriers and outposts from which the soldiers keep watch on the enemy.
There is a palpable atmosphere of clastrophobic despair in this movie. We never glimpse the enemy and the Israelis fire not a single shot during its two-hours. They cower under a constant barrage of Hizbollah mortar fire, asking themselves what the hell they are doing there. They watch as a collague is blown to smithereens trying to dismantle a mine to open a road that goes nowhere which nobody uses. They see two colleagues killed by guided anti-tank missiles to which the Israeli army has no answer. Their commander, a kid called Liraz, tries to bolster his men's determination and belief in the mission -- but he himself no longer understands the mission. There is a certain mystique about the site itself -- but it turns out that the famous capture in 1982 may have been the result of a military blunder.
Israel's invasion of Lebanon was a tragic mistake. It was designed to make northern Israel safe from Palestinian rockets but the Palestinians were simply replaced by an even more implaccable enemy, Hizbollah. In 2006, Israel made the same mistake again and fought the Second Lebanon War against Hizbollah, proving that the country's political leaders had learned nothing.
Hundreds of lives were sacrificed for nothing.
This movie, brilliantly designed, photographed and acted, is a metaphor for these twin tragedies.",1244937600,4,1933,5.159235668789809

To the soldiers in the fort. There is no purpose is dieing just to stay a bit longer. I found it interesting that to the higher command and to many others, the fort represented something. It had a history. But to the soldiers all they want to do is go and survive. When someone dies, they question the purpose. While the officer in charge, is trying to keep them together.

I found the scenes of the social attitudes of the Israeli soldiers and commander interesting.
