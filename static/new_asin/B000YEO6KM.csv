Personally, I don't like documentary style filming like Distract 13 so it had a huge strike against it right there.  Maybe if you like Blair Witch & District 13, you'll like it but it just felt like a bunch of scattered, not that funny moments to me coarse I was playing a game while watching it.  Sometimes I do that & the movie is so good I have to stop to watch more intently.  Not the case here.  At least the cast list was interesting.  Still not sure it was even worth $2.00 though.",1266624000,4,622,4.090909090909091
