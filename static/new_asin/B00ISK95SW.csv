6290795,5,B00ISK95SW,I love this disturbing little gem.,1412380800,,34,4.833333333333333
6290796,5,B00ISK95SW,"Absolutely breathtaking~... Extremely difficult to watch, the violence indeed excruciating.  However, the superlative acting and spot on acting made the whole event riveting.  Would highly recommend.",1411516800,,199,6.615384615384615
6290797,5,B00ISK95SW,"Excellent plot, solid acting, great gore, superb filming.  If you are a fan of revenge movies with a strong central character, a great supporting cast, and a believable story-line, you can't miss this movie.  Just every bit as enjoyable as the ""Horseman"".",1409616000,3,255,5.0476190476190474
6290798,5,B00ISK95SW,"WOW!! This movie took me to another place deep down inside myself like no other horror has. Normally i'm unable to handle scenes such as the ones in this movie but i couldn't turn away, and to top it off, i replayed the movie all over again??? And once i was finally done, i felt sad, but not only because of the crime but also because i wish all such crimes came to such conclusions??? Anyway, this blew me away,,,, oh, and if you don't like going to the dentist or to a proctologist, maybe you should stay away from this.",1408406400,8,523,4.188118811881188
6290799,3,B00ISK95SW,I guess the Aussies are making further inroads into the gore and revenge genre.  Nice use of splatter and blood but a vague revelation as to the nature of the killer.  The resolution is rushed but necessary.,1406332800,,207,4.5675675675675675
6290800,4,B00ISK95SW,Good movie but didn't like the gory part to graphic in that way.,1405641600,,64,4.0
6290801,5,B00ISK95SW,"Wow. I am speechless. This movie had me so psyched when I read the reviews and let me tell you...it was amazing. I was so insanely happy when it started and I realized it could be the next best extreme horror in a while. Everything was there. From the start I noticed the production value was very good. Excellent lighting. Camera quality was impeccable. Usually when I get DVDs and play them in my blu ray player they look like crap. This one looked sharp and crisp, on a 71 inch led nonetheless. (This is important since nothing ruins a horror movie more than bad lighting/film quality. Kills the gore scenes and some times makes the film unwatchable regardless of the content) Great quality for a DVD I was really impressed. Moving on, this movie had an amazing pace to it. I am one that tends to fall asleep late at night for some movies (even if they have redeemable scenes at the end) due to a bad and boring pacing of a movie. This movie had an impeccable pace for a true horror fan. The perfect introduction. The perfect elements all aligning for a truly horrifying slow burn. The set up in the first half is just excellent and really helps to build the tension since we know the story is going to go sideways at any moment. Now the second half...oh the second half... What can I say without saying too much haha. The second half is a gore hounds wet dream. It pushes limits of onscreen violence. It gives you a real descent into madness. Thankfully there is a small sparing if black humor here and there to keep you from passing out from the extremity of the violence. If you are into this kind of horror then this movie is your new best friend. I promise you. I hope I have done my part to share with you the best new film I've seen in the last two years. Watch it and you can thank me later :)",1400025600,14,1804,4.277777777777778
6290802,5,B00ISK95SW,"DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL is a bold and bonkers torture-fest, as advertised. It also happens to be a solid indie-drama at the same time. If you like Horror realism with A+ gore-effects, welcome to your new favorite guilty- pleasure. The filmmaker nicely takes his time setting up the story during the first hour and then, well, I pity the unsuspecting viewer who doesn't know what's coming.

For a micro-budget project, the acting is decent, the cinematography is well-done and the hardcore horror fans get their huge dose of over-the- top sadistic gnarly- ness. Haven't we all seen so many ridiculously bad attempts at low-budget Horror? I sure have and DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL is quite the opposite. Brilliant work.",1394928000,20,707,5.042735042735043
6290803,4,B00ISK95SW,Good Movie,1430956800,,10,4.5
6290804,4,B00ISK95SW,very good.,1429574400,,10,4.5
6290805,5,B00ISK95SW,"Very good,disturbing revenge film. Well acted,make's you wonder what these filmmakers could do with a big budget? Recommended!",1428019200,,126,6.055555555555555
6290806,5,B00ISK95SW,Ok I going to start off my reviews like all the others I am in no way any kind of movie critic I love watching movies and to read some of these reviews I am totally amazed on the detail etc etc well don't expect that here or on any of my other reviews ok that been said and out of the way I thought the movie was excellent just think payback and revenge if I was this guy I would have done the same and possibly much worse,1427414400,,422,3.752808988764045
6290807,3,B00ISK95SW,okay,1424908800,,4,4.0
6290808,4,B00ISK95SW,"Good movie; solid acting, somewhat predictable plot but enjoyable nonetheless....GREAT torture scenes!!!",1421625600,,104,7.75
6290809,5,B00ISK95SW,GUT WRENCHING AND AMAZING MAKEUP EFFECTS. I LOVE THIS MOVIE ITS AWESOME,1421539200,,71,5.0
6290810,5,B00ISK95SW,"This movie starts off slow and corny, 20mins in I was ready to almost just give it up, but then something amazing happens, the movie pulls you in, lures you there and keeps you there. Plot twist after plot twist begins to amount. A whole lot of new angles that haven't been exploited by the gore industry yet. I was left pleasantly surprised by this piece. It's dark, depraved and sinister yet human.",1421193600,,400,4.493150684931507
6290811,4,B00ISK95SW,"My word this is a sad one; no happy ending here. So if you want to watch an incredibly surprising outcome of a kidnapping, this will stay with you...",1417651200,,149,4.172413793103448
6290812,4,B00ISK95SW,"I, for some reason, tend to find Australian horror to be lacking and have get to find any I'd recommend. Action films, yes, horror, no. This film was an exception. It's not horror in the ""scare"" sense, but rather a dark psychological revenge-torture film. If you are into that sub-sub genre of horror, you'll like this one. The father's descent and duality in the film is quite worth the price of admission.",1417651200,2,407,4.666666666666667
6290813,1,B00ISK95SW,Horrific movie! If you like watching someone being tortured then this is the movie for you!,1417564800,,91,4.75
6290814,4,B00ISK95SW,"Very enticing film that I think alot of us would relate to if an unfortunate event were to happen to us (GOD FORBID). The first few minutes were a slow burn basically showing the lives of the characters but as soon as it picked up.... Boy, it did not restrain. The way it takes you in making you sympathize and even cheer him on. Solid film",1416528000,,340,4.166666666666667
6290815,5,B00ISK95SW,"I found this quite well acted. Not a film to go to if you're looking for mystery or a lot of complicated twists and turns. Just a straightforward piece of revenge drama with a heavy dose of torture porn.
I don't waste my time splitting hairs about what is torture porn and what isn't. All this silliness about ""it's only tp if it has no redeeming value.""  To me, it's torture porn if it lingers on scenes of torture, and that's what happens here. Just for the record, I don't believe in torture, even for the sort of child-molesting and murdering scum we encounter here---although if it were my child, who knows what I would do...but I do believe that there's a place for it on the screen, because that's one of the legitimate avenues we have for the necessary task of exploring our nightmares.",1416268800,,794,4.475862068965517
6290816,2,B00ISK95SW,"It had a very promising story, but more than half the movie was just torture scenes. If you like horror, but are not a true gore fan, this will disappoint. I actually don't mind some gore, but this was way, way, way, way (you get it) too long and nauseating. If I want that much torture in the future, I'll just try to make sense of Sarah Palin for an hour.",1416182400,12,357,4.042253521126761
6290817,1,B00ISK95SW,"yes, today is your lucky day: you're reading this review and have a chance to second guess your interest in this ugly and exploitative waste of life.

of the 100 minute run time, about 40 minutes are torture. no, i don't mean the acting is bad, i mean a guy strapped to a table, head in a spiked vise, getting cut, burned, teeth ripped out ... and this isn't a psychological drama of accusation and excuse, because the victim's tracheotomy prevents any. no, this is just a ranting vengeance monolog punctuated with new stages in the mutilation marathon. the first 50 minutes are just a set up for the sucker punch. that is, if you missed ""slaughter fx"" as the studio. of course, it's not real violence, it's just pretend snuff, with chocolate syrup blood and waxy wound prosthetics, which makes it even more pathetic.

who enjoys dreck like this? the positive reviews can only come from two sources: friends and backers of the production, and mental defectives.",1415404800,7,961,4.714285714285714
6290818,2,B00ISK95SW,"Okay, the first thing you should know that this is a VERY low-budget Aussie offering (low budget in that way that it sounds as if it's been recorded in someone's living room). However, the initial story and quite good acting by the lead actor (everyone else is terrible; they seem like 'friends of the director' more than professional actors, especially the guy who turns out to be the killer) was enough to keep me engaged. But then, it suddenly takes a turn into the most unpleasant torture/gore fest ever with (considering the low budget) pretty convincing special effects....so if you like that kind of thing, you'll probably enjoy watching someone strapped to a table for the last half hour of the movie and subjected to every kind of repulsive torture known to man.
I don't like that kind of thing, and actually had to fast forward over all that.
Further to this, it is hardly a compelling 'whodunnit' or mystery, as there is only about four characters in it, so the big 'reveal' falls flat.

All in all....I'm afraid that despite a good effort, this was sort of rubbish.",1414886400,4,1077,4.698412698412699
6290819,4,B00ISK95SW,DAM! fine Ausie torture porn. This is a movie that who ever created it cared a great deal and it shows beginning to end. Give it a chance on a night when your are bored and you won't be disappointed.,1414713600,,199,4.0
6290820,4,B00ISK95SW,"The torture scenes were very hard to watch, however, he deserved everything he got and more.  If there is undeniable proof that someone raped, tortured, murdered an innocent little one, like in this movie, I have no problem with punishment on par with this.  We are weak as water in this country when it comes to meting out punishment for brutality committed against children and animals.  Prisoners have a better existence than many living in poverty.  They get medical, dental, cable, heat and a/c, 3 square meals a day...they should be kept in a dungeon, a concrete bed, a bucket for a toilet, no entertainment, and bread and water.",1414195200,2,635,4.798165137614679
6290821,4,B00ISK95SW,"I have been fooled by a lot of amazon movies lately...

This one isn't some trumped up pay for star movie... It is good.

Good acting.

OK plot.

Gory.

Good movie.",1413072000,5,164,4.161290322580645
6290822,4,B00ISK95SW,"Wow - this movie tugs at your heart strings. I wouldn't classify it as horror minus the extremely gruesome scenes which I will leave you to see for yourself. More than anything it deals with family drama - how far would you go to avenge your daughter's death? We mostly follow the main character and his internal breakdown which is a really interesting take on this genre. I give it four starts because i think its worth a rental, not a purchase. Seeing it once was enough - not sure my stomach could make it through another viewing.",1412726400,6,533,4.448979591836735
8645039,1,B00ISK95SW,What rapist and killer leaves a diary describing everything he has done in a file cabinet by his desk? Why write it all out for someone to find and read? Why not hide the diary or lock it up somewhere. Totally made no sense and that unbelievable plot ruined it for me.,1516665600,,268,4.173076923076923
8645040,5,B00ISK95SW,One of the worst and heinous crimes to me is child murder.  And I say the father was a hero.  So sad bc somewhere out there some kid has or will relive this. Great movie great actors.,1515628800,,183,3.918918918918919
8645041,3,B00ISK95SW,"Acting, sets, writing were all good but not much more to it than an hour+ of torture porn.  If that's your thing you'll really enjoy the movie, but if you enjoy horror movies that are even the tiniest bit unpredictable or cerebral this won't really satisfy.",1493510400,,257,4.586956521739131
8645042,4,B00ISK95SW,"Good movie, better than I expected. Just VERY GORY...If you don't like blood and all that ""Saw"" type of stuff, don't watch.",1481155200,,123,4.636363636363637
8645043,5,B00ISK95SW,I absolutely loved this movie! Only complaint I even have is the movie goes from soft spoken to loud back and forth in certain parts so you can have the volume on 30 then have to turn it down to 20. It also skipped the first minute of the movie but after a good cleaning it didn't. This is definitely a must buy for any horror fan!! I'm so glad I found out about Chris Sun and this movie!!! Glad I didn't wait till next payday to purchase it either!!,1459036800,,450,4.011111111111111
8645044,2,B00ISK95SW,OMG! I never need to see another Revenge/Torture movie again after watching this. I could barely make it thru. Forget The Hostel movies or Saw franchise. They both pale in comparison to this. I have to say the little girl was adorable.,1450483200,,235,4.619047619047619
8645045,2,B00ISK95SW,"2 Stars if you want to learn about how to torture someone.  I mean that jokingly.  Otherwise this film was amazingly boring.  I like bloody, if it makes sense within the context of the film. Film needed a few more scenes; something was missing.  It just didn't move me.",1447632000,,269,4.428571428571429
8645046,4,B00ISK95SW,"This was very gory, but nothing any parent wouldn't wish for if there child was murdered and raped. Well done.",1444435200,,110,4.55
8645047,5,B00ISK95SW,i love the torture but that was to kind for  the sicko,1443139200,,54,3.5
8645048,5,B00ISK95SW,I thought it was an excellent movie if you are into that kind of movie (which I am). I have to admit I was leaning toward a different person as the killer for about 1/2 of the movie. Warning if you are squeamish this is probably not the movie for you but if you are a Father that loves his children watch this movie. If you are a pervert watch this movie this might be what is in store for you.(I hope),1441670400,,402,3.9146341463414633
