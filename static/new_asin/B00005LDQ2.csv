7943750,4,B00005LDQ2,"Dewitt Jones has my heart . . . what a wise, skilled teacher. I bring this visually exquisite film to students in my community college classes every semester and find new inspiration at each showing. I love being reminded that ""there is always more than one right answer."" Inspiration is balanced with pragmatism: ""train your technique""; in other words, learn your lessons and do your homework.
I do have two reservations about recommending it for purchase:
1. His culmination of principles revolves around a charming and instructive anecdote with a gorgeous photographic result from a Dewar's Scotch photo shoot (""The good things in life stay that way--Dewar's Scotch""), but I am always a little concerned about showing this segment to students, some of whom have told me are recovering alcoholics.
2. There are several errors in the captioning. Again, for students, I want every image to be helpful and accurate. Besides some minor mistakes and strange capitalization, ""every day"" (two words) is printed out as ""everyday"" (one word). Jones is encouraging his viewers to use everyday creativity (daily, regular, usual creativity) every day (each single day), but whoever does the captioning at Star Thrower Distribution never made that distinction. I was in lengthy conversation with them about making the numerous needed captioning changes, but they sent back the film with all the same mistakes. For $795  (!), it ought to be perfect. Dewitt Jones deserves better, and so do my students.
I will continue to show it, but with these little worries tapping me on the shoulder.",1382140800,,1576,5.132295719844358
