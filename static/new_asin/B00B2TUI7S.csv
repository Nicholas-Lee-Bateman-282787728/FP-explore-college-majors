5553599,4,B00B2TUI7S,"A group of kids are sent to detention. We know who survives. It is shown in the first scene before we digress.

The main cast:

Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) is the level headed victim of circumstances with a bad boy reputation.

Meagan McDurst (Amanda Alch) is our good girl who had a moment of stress in the classroom.

Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato) is an unlikeable geeky klepto.

Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke) is our Goth.

Craig Cook (Roger Edwards) is the jock.

Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) is the plastic with mommy and drug issues.

The beginning also introduces the creepy janitor Max (Ben Browder) and school psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt).

They are sealed inside the haunted school library built upon stolen Indian land. They opt to have a seance which leads to...

The film is campy. The kids wear school uniforms in case you have a thing for plaid skirts. At several times it copies other films, but it is far from a spoof.
The film is cultish. It has blood and killing, but the horror/suspense was weak making it more akin to a slasher. The humor is not over powering and comes from misdirection. Worth a view. Will add to my collection when the price drops.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, nudity (thank you Amanda Alch).

Note to self: You don't want to be the one caught holding the ax.",1365724800,5,1312,4.632034632034632
5553600,4,B00B2TUI7S,"The preview looked good.  A horror version of the Breakfast Club. I started to get worried though when the main character crashes his car in an empty parking lot.  A piece of paper blocked his windshield, then rather than just stop in the empty parking lot, he continued to accelerate and drive around blind until he drove into a light pole.  Scary.

The next sign was the incredibly bad CGI cockroaches.  Wouldnt it have been better, cheaper and easier to get a couple real cockroaches?  Then we meet the main characters.  All look like their in their mid 20's or older. The actress with the mega eyebrows playing the prom queen looked anorexic.  The goth girl looked real rough especially when her makeup washes off.  Like Lindsey Lohan on a bender rough. Both these girls need an intervention.  BUT, the headmaster played a good part, the jock, the hot brainy chick, the janitor and Nelson from the original Breakfast Club all do a good job.

Then we get to the flashbacks of the offenses that landed them in detention. This leads to fighting and making up and fighting again and becoming allies off and on repeatedly in the course of like, six minutes.

With 15 minutes to go, I hated the movie. Thought it was horrible.  THEN came the big surprise, twist, ending.  ""what the heck , how do you explain ..?!?!, why would he have...?!?""  Wow.  Then the very end out of left field and Im talking about the very very end- last thirty seconds.  So bad that it made the movie for me.  I am definitely going to buy the DVD.  Its like a negative times a negative makes a positive I guess.

Now that Ive watched the movie twice, I picked up the addditional subtle clues that I missed the first time.  Good premise, huge rationalizations about why the kids cant be rescued, bad CGI effects, completely implausible ending, some funny parts ( intended or otherwise )  Im buying this.",1363305600,18,1875,4.5675675675675675
5553601,5,B00B2TUI7S,"The title of this neat little plot twister is unfortunate.  I'm therefore guilty of judging a book by it's cover and this movie by its title.  Shame on me.  But, I happen to think Ben Browder is a gem of an actor and a canny one, to boot.  What could possibly entice him into a bad movie?  So I decided to give it a look...and I'm glad I did.

As I said, it has a neat plot twist and some very comic moments to keep the blood and gore from totally taking over.  In that regard, the casting of the disabled student is a masterpiece.  I'm sure that in one instance, the fact that he looked exactly like Beeker the Muppet was not a coincidence.  I did have a problem with the roaches in one respect.  Sure, they're like ""bad kids"" in that they are hard to get rid of, but considering how rich the school is, while the kids may be there, the insects would have been visited by Orkin, I'm sure.  If you're a fan of the genre, which I prefer sheer fright to gore, you'll note there is some predictability, but that still isn't a detractor.

""Bad Kids Go to Hell"" is a three-quarters polished gem.  Give it a watch.",1363046400,10,1108,4.145539906103286
5553602,1,B00B2TUI7S,"This movie was not worth what I paid to rent it.  I was only given the option of renting it for 7 days.  The acting is poor, the plot is boring.

Some silly teen stuff, hot chicks, but mainly very wicked and satirical. This little movie is going to get big. Who are these guys???",1360108800,6,286,5.239130434782608
5553604,4,B00B2TUI7S,"In a category of Indie horror/ teen thrillers, this is a fun and well put together film. I would even say that it comes close to the same quality as the studio level releases. There's some good TnA, some nice gore and some scary moments that will generally keep you entertained. Plus, it's shot a lot better then most indie films and will leave you much more satisfied then the normal indie shlock that groups like Asylum puts out.
It's faithful to the comic book with a few adjustments to add to the over-all plot. So if you've read the comic, you'll know basically what's coming but it's fun to watch.",1359417600,7,603,4.441441441441442
5553605,5,B00B2TUI7S,"This movie is a lot of fun! It was fast-paced and full of dark humor (which I love). There were lots of twists and turns in the story and I never would have guessed the twist ending... Best of all, I found out the movie was made by some Texas dudes that grew up near where I live and has a bunch of up-and-comers for the 'bad' kids in the movie. Judd Nelson even makes an ironic appearance as the headmaster of the school where the kids all attend.

As a bonus, I loved the music from the movie! The soundtrack includes artists like Semi Precious Weapons, AWOLNation and The M Machine.

I think Bad Kids Go To Hell could be one of those cult classics. There's a comic series that came before the movie and apparently a Bad Kids Go To Hell 2 comic in the works.

...Could this mean that there's a 2nd movie too?",1359331200,8,810,4.146496815286624
5553606,5,B00B2TUI7S,"Not what I was expecting. The movie doesn't really fit in one genre. It is a dark comedy and thriller with elements of horror and gore. The acting is great, and not just from Judd Nelson, Ben Browder and newcomer Jeffrey Schmidt, but from all the ""bad kids"" who are able to play their roles believably even in the most sardonic situations. It has some of the funniest most memorable scenes from a movie I've ever seen and at the same time it had me on the edge of my seat until the very unexpected ending. This is sure to be an instant cult classic. Oh..and the music is badass!",1359331200,4,578,4.263636363636364
5553617,2,B00B2TUI7S,"I read the other reviews before watching. There was a twist ending, and I like Ben Browder, so I watched the whole thing. No skipping. No interruptions. Even a beer in hand, so I wouldn't be too judgmental.

I have to say I am not at all impressed. Don't waste your time. I watched ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" before this, and it is 10 times better.",1476316800,,361,4.3088235294117645

5553648,2,B00B2TUI7S,"I really wanted to like this, I mean, c'mon, a horror version of the cult classic ""The Breakfast Club""? And it even had Judd Nelson! But in reality it ended up like a bad orgy between ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""Scream"" spawning a dumber, youthful version with similarities to them, but totally lacking in the charm and ingenuity they had. As it happens, I am a huge fan of the aforementioned movies so one might assume a marriage between them might give birth to a truly awesome flick. Not so. The final twist at the end tried for originality - but felt familiar in the viewing.  Though I suppose some might be drawn to the prerequisite booby/soft porn shots. However, not watching this for the booby shots, I found not even Judd Nelson or Ben Browder could save this film (they weren't involved in the booby shots, by the way). While I didn't hate the film, I was greatly disappointed in it so cannot recommend it.",1463443200,,943,4.547058823529412

5553680,4,B00B2TUI7S,"Everything about Bad Kids Go To Hell is almost perfect in its utilization of nostalgia it tries to capture, with all the tribute images and backdrops that so epically scream John Hughes. From the library, the character traits of the kids, (only more modern and less wholesome), who make up the cast, right down to the awesome Judd Nelson cameo as Head Master. The flaw (which is minor) is that it seemed to go hardcore in referencing the 80s high school flick but sadly no real dialogue reverb from the movie, what - not one kid could have found a way to declare I wanna be just like you. I figure all I need, is a lobotomy and some tights. Okay, I know new decade , new social commentary. The film does have some very awesome quotable moments that I loved, my fave I don't worship the devil, I just promote him. The cast where killer in their role and all had more than enough back story and depth of personality to bring the characters to life. I did want a bit more bravado, overt-expression from a couple of the characters. I thought they where more subdued than they should have been, but still the acting was stellar. Plus a hot cast can hardly ever go wrong.

The movies spooky element was a nice premise to keep the plot stimulated, (remember I am not giving any details away here), which seemed to put the kids paranoia in overdrive, and the ending twist was cool. Although it almost came off as lame, thank god it was the ending, and not revealed earlier or the film would have failed, much like Cry Wolf.  The effects and gore are there but not really allowed to be the focal point of the moment which is kind of a bummer but still it didn't detract from the movie. Bad Kids Go To Hell is a fun, dark satire on High School life as well as basic social discourse that we all have to endure. Plus the subtext of how, based on generation gap and over extended lives, adults tend to view life and young people with a very distorted view outside of the reality that teens or young people in general experience (and vice versa). All in all this film is pretty excellent and a great addition for fans of 80s throwbacks or contemporary American movies, although technically it isn't a horror film it does have some pretty thrilling moments in true Draconian fashion. The real meat of the story lies with the way they reveal how each kid got sent into detention. The flashback is totally 90s here is how stylization.

Bad Kids Go to Hell (2012) *1/2
D: Matthew Spradlin
C: Cameron Deane Stewart, Augie Duke, Ali Faulkner, Roger Edwards, Amanda Alch, Marc Donato, Ben Browder, Judd Nelson, Chanel Ryan, Jeffrey Schmidt
P: Six high school students stuck in Saturday afternoon detention for 8 hours start to fall victim to a series of bizarre accidents in the school's seemingly haunted library.

Mishmash of horror and comedy with references from The Breakfast Club, Carrie, Less Than Zero, Twilight and even Scooby Doo thrown in for good measure. Bad Kids Go to Hell is one of those films that's messy, disjointed, uneven and in general just all over the place. There's too many twists and turns. The plot is hard to follow at times. The film's slapstick elements feel completely out of place with the film's referential tone.

Bad Kids Go to Hell has a lot of ideas, too many in fact. While a certain idea may sound good as a stand alone idea, you have to ask yourself this ""Does this idea fit within the context of the film that I am creating?"". The people behind Bad Kids Go to Hell failed to bring an editing eye to the material. [R] 91 mins.",1385078400,,1191,4.661904761904762
5553695,4,B00B2TUI7S,"This movie is so dang campy, it is fantastic! It's like a cross between Scream and Mean Girls. You really have to take it as a horror comedy, because there are some parts that make absolutely no sense like a nail gun that operates without a loud compressor- but whatever. Think of what would be scary to a 16 year old and you've got it, Buffy etc. I absolutely loved this movie. I wish they wouldn't have done a female upper frontal- it kind if limits the audience. I saw it through Redbox.",1375142400,3,490,4.279569892473118

5553697,1,B00B2TUI7S,"I like a good bad movie as well as the next person, but this was beyond words awful. I'll never get those 2 hours back.",1370390400,,119,3.8
5553698,2,B00B2TUI7S,"Thrillers particularily tongue in cheek ones usually are about 50/50 on the good/bad scale, ""Bad Kids Go To Hell"" tries for creative and funny, but ends up falling short. The opening scene sees a S.W.A.T. entering a lavish library at Crestview Academy, there's some dead bodies and a young man holding a bloody axe. We then flashback to 8 hours earlier where the same young man named Max who is on the verge of explusion coming to serve detention on a Saturday afternoon.

There's some of young people of course, there's Tricia the pretty one, the bad girl Veronica, the black athlete Craig, there's the odd boy Tarek, and of course the timid girl Megan who has her own wild side, and she's actually the prettiest of them all in my opinion. All these people seem to have something against Max for a variety of reasons, the Headmaster just doesn't seem to care about these students despite what trying to put on a caring demeanor. There's also the odd and fairly creepy janitor, oh and rumors of ghosts and spirits that haunt the school.

There are some big roaches here crawling around and as if you needed more of a red herring about ghosts and hauntings there's a giant statue of a person and a snake. So once these teens are locked up in the library there's the usual banter, then a seance of sorts to draw out a spirit and then all out well (the last word in the title) starts to happen. We see flashbacks of what got everyone in detention and why they would all want to kill the others. Then people start dying in graphic ways, but there are still many jokes bouncing around.

Sadly this movie seems all too familiar, like it's trying too hard to be different, there's also some very odd scenes like a strip show done in the middle of a classroom (which received no complaints from me mind you). Despite my talking down about aspects of the movie this isn't a horrid flick, nothing great mind you, not something I would say don't watch, it has some fun moments and some good gore at least. It's definitely trash, but then again that seems to be the point. *1/2 out of 4 stars.",1370044800,,2081,4.456692913385827
5553699,1,B00B2TUI7S,"I wanted to rent ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bachelorette/dp/B008Y0IMIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bachelorette</a>"", but Redbox gave me ""Bad Kids Go to Hell"" instead so I figured why not? The movie opens with five teenagers at an elite high school showing up for Saturday detention,  la ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakfast-Club/dp/B001BR5NN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakfast Club</a>"". The faculty member overseeing them collects their cell phones then locks them into a beautifully-appointed upper-story school library behind titanium-reinforced doors that cannot be chopped down with an axe. Faster than you can say, ""Fire hazard"" the kids start turning on each other. Some of them may be in on a dastardly plot, and the library itself may be haunted by the vengeful ghost of an old Indian whose house was razed to build it. The whole thing plays out like a cross between a slasher movie, Scooby Doo and a laugh-free episode of ""Strangers with Candy"". To the movie's credit I didn't predict every obvious twist at the end, but to its detriment, I didn't care.

What is striking about ""Bad Kids Go to Hell"" is that it is competently made. The production values are that of a high-end TV movie and, given the limitations of the script, the acting is solid. Even the writing shows a degree of self-awareness: the kids (or more like ""kids"" because the actors are all in their twenties and look older) communicate in Joss Whedonesque quips which, while not funny, at least display a respectable amount of tongue in cheek. In a bit of meta stunt casting, the school's headmaster is played by original ""Breakfast Club"" bad-boy, Judd Nelson, hidden behind a trapezoidal beard. The DVD extras include a voiceover from the film's editor explaining how he applied his craft to the opening shots. This is a well-made movie. Everyone showed up and did their jobs.

And that just makes it worse. ""Bad Kids go to Hell"" has no neophyte energy, no charming incompetence. Nor is it the least bit sleazy. If the sitcom dialog and ridiculous plot were just there to fill the spaces between the next messy dispatch or flash of boobs, it might get credit for delivering the B-movie goods, but the sex and violence are kept to a minimum. There is the tiniest bit of gore and gratuitous nudity, but it is awkwardly tacked on, as if the film makers were grudgingly fulfilling some contractual obligation before getting back to the juicy business of revealing whether the library really is haunted. ""Bad Kids go to Hell"" is not so bad it's good. It's more like so okay it starts to make you feel a little sad. I watched it all the way to the end, but mostly just so I could have an answer to the question, who watches this all the way to the end?",1369267200,5,2823,5.092872570194385

5553706,4,B00B2TUI7S,"Judd Nelson's appearance in BAD KIDS GO TO HELL is quite ironic since this film is a twisted take on Nelson's hit 80s THE BREAKFAST CLUB.  The wicked connection is both films are set in a high school detention hall, although the result in BAD KIDS is certainly quite different.
A semi-slasher film, BAD KIDS is enjoyable---there's some dark humor; a somewhat clever plot, though it gets a little contrived at the end.  As in most films of this ilk, all the characters are obnoxious and unlikeable and played by actors who haven't been teenagers in a decade.
I also applaud the director for lighting the film so you can see what's going on, unlike many other recent scare flicks.
Overall, BAD KIDS is a cut above the current slashers and makes for a decent rental.",1365811200,7,763,4.602941176470588

8561757,3,B00B2TUI7S,"Nice light horror homage version of The Breakfast Club with homages to key scenes in Carrie and a few other high school set films.  It's let down however by a spoiler scene at the start.  Have no idea what the point of movies doing this is, all it does is let you know who will still be around at the end.  Without the spoiler scene it would have been at least a four star rated movie.

Like the Breakfast Club a range of different social aspects of a high school have detention in the school's library on a Saturday. The only adults there are the vice principal and a mentally challenged janitor. This one though is rumoured to be haunted.  It's a new building having been built on a now dead Indian owner's land who didn't want to sell.  The vice principal will of course leave them to study, he's taken their mobile phones and has locked the doors.  Apparently this new building must have no emergency exit.  The students all hate each other and one states they aren't going to end up best friends like the Breakfast Club.  She's right.  Most won't be leaving the library alive.  It's just a shame we have that spoiler scene, so all that's left is to learn why they got detention, and see it all play out.",1511740800,,1208,4.348214285714286

8561760,5,B00B2TUI7S,"This movie often gets called ""The Breakfast Club meets The Grudge"", but that's only because it's about a bunch of kids in detention getting killed off one by one.

In actuality, it's not a horror movie. It's really more of a dark comedy with horror elements.

Based on a comic book, the film stars Ben Browder (of Stargate and Farscape fame) and Judd Nelson (of The Breakfast Club fame) as well as a ton of up and coming ""kids"" trying to survive a ""haunted"" school detention.

Lots of fun, some good scares, and some amazing FX makeup (if I do say so myself!) by the amazing Spat Oktan of SpatCave Studios (Facebook.com/SpatCaveStudios).  Worth the watch. And the sequel, Bad Kids of Crestview Academy) comes out in theaters and online on January 13, 2017!
