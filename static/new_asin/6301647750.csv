7813200,5,6301647750,"Yet another VHS release of Belinda Carlisle material and videos. This is a great program as well and has many of her early solo video songs, some shown here for the first time back when this was released in the late 1980s. Now, if the distributors can only find their way to release this even on dvd or better yet Bluray, I sure would buy it again. This VHS compiles material from her 1987 and 1989 albums.

**UPDATE**
EDSEL started to release all of Belinda's solo albums on DELUXE editions and they included all her videos, the concerts she did for the three albums in the '80s, and Belinda herself did several interviews discussing the making of each album. The quality is superb!",1395360000,,683,4.5528455284552845
7813201,3,6301647750,An excellent compilation undone by poor video and audio quality. I feel that record companies should take note of Belinda's popular numbers and must have a greatest hits compilations of her music videos on 2 DVDs as she was one of the finest artists featuring in her music videos.,1345420800,2,280,4.73469387755102
7813202,5,6301647750,"Well, Belinda is at her best as usual!  Runaway videos is proof of that.  This was the first CD I purchased with music videos on it and I found it to be a worthwhile investment.  My favorite is ""Summer Rain!""  My question is, ""Will Belinda do anything to top what she has already done?""",1097280000,,286,4.2407407407407405
