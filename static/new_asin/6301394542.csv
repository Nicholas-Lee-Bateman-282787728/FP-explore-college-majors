332580,5,6301394542,"This may sound strange, but as a big Lugosi fan I never thought very highly of ""White Zombie""...until now. I now realize why it was never that high on my favorite list of Bela stuff; I couldn't see the damn picture on my other versions clearly enough for all the dirt and darkness. This DVD from the Roan Group is, in one word, superb. It's been cleaned up, and it's like a whole new experience for me to watch it now. (I think it actually looks better than those much more expensive special editions of Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady vanishes"".) Lugosi's performance is good, and it's certainly a nice part for him, but among all his great roles I don't think it's his best. -However, I do appreciate it more now that I can finally see it !. (My fave of his is 1935's ""The Raven"".) There's a wonderful dream-like quality throughout, and some very atmospheric set-pieces, like the eerie mill. One scene in particular stands out; the conversation between the old man and our completely inept hero. The scene is 5 minutes long, and there isn't a single cut in it which I guess is highly unusual for a horror film, but a brave move. The only problem I have with ""W.Z."" is the constant use of music. -There's music in nearly every scene, and apparently the film-makers wanted their movie to be somewhat in the style of old silent films, but I feel it would've been even more effective with less. The excellent talk by Gary Don Rhodes is informative about cast & production, just as these commentary tracks are supposed to be. This DVD is the one and only version of ""White Zombie"" to have.",972864000,38,1595,4.484536082474227
332581,4,6301394542,"Absolutely one of the most imaginative, stylized and unusual films that I  have seen. Bela Lugosi is wonderful in this 1930's horror flick. The sets  are truely awesome and very remenicent of Dracula done the year before. It  is a real treat to behold Lugosi at his best. The acting and the music are  blended well and despite the stageyness of the film; the dreamlike quality  of it will hold you attention. A must see for Lugosi fans.",965779200,2,436,4.538461538461538
332582,4,6301394542,"Between the introduction of sound and the imposition of the Hollywood Code, some of the most inventive movies ever seen were produced and 'White Zombie' is a prime example. On paper, the plot is pretty basic. However it  is the ultra-strange premise - zombies roaming around the Haiti countryside  working as slaves for a power-mad Bela Lugosi - that makes the film so  unique. It doesn't have the polished feel of the classic Universal horrors  such as 'The Mummy' or 'Frankenstein' but it lacks nothing in imagination.  The movie also benefits from good direction and excellent set designs. A  lot of credit must go to the 'Roan Group' for the production of this DVD.  We get the obligatory trailer and commentary but the real bonus is the  picture quality. You will not find a better print of 'White Zombie'  anywhere. Do not make the mistake of thinking 'White Zombie' is a museum  piece only of interest to film buffs because of its age. The selling point  of this DVD is that above all 'White Zombie' is highly entertaining, so  don't just watch it - enjoy it!",960940800,30,1066,4.672043010752688

In Haiti, zombies work for their white master Lugosi (in a blissfully evil camp performance) on a sugar plantation; here he menaces young newlyweds.........  The rarely seen silent star Madge Bellamy (she wrote the autobiographical A DARLING OF THE TWENTIES very late in life while living in abject poverty)  is not seen to advantage here, her acting style too reminiscent of silents.

WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) was directed by Victor Halperin. His brother Edward was producer on this film also another called REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (1936) that's set in Cambodia. I've seen it, and it's none too good. Besides these two, Victor directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TORTURE-SHIP/dp/B00008J2G9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TORTURE SHIP</a>&nbsp;(1939) and BURIED ALIVE (1939). Despite creative titles, the latter three are poor quality and typical Poverty Row programmers.

This film spends a lot of time on actor facial reactions, so it seems a product of the silent era that the director began in. Those shots of Lugosi's eyes all brightly lit are classic. The acting, especially Madge Kennedy's is pure hokum. It's rather sad that so soon after Bela Lugosi's triumph in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DRACULA/dp/B000035Z3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DRACULA</a>&nbsp;(1931) he was consigned to bit roles in major studio pictures or starring ones in these second rate productions. It's said his accent held him back, but maybe a morphine addiction was also a factor?

Joseph Cawthorn's Dr. Bruner is the equivalent of DRACULA's Van Helsing; he holds all the answers about his evil and dangerous antagonist. Clarence Muse has what was for him a substantial role. His wide-eyed with fear coach driver in the opening sequence immediately establishes that this pleasure trip to Haiti for the young couple (Bellamy and John Harron) will be everything but a good time. A further complication for Miss Bellamy is Robert Frazer as a local plantation owner who is smitten with her. Between Frazer's intention to woo Bellamy away from Harron and Lugosi's determination that she become his personal zombie, the young lady is in for not hot, but roiling water.

The production was shot with sets and furniture rented from UNIVERSAL, where previous horror movies had been made. These include DRACULA (1931),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FRANKENSTEIN/dp/B00000JMOF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FRANKENSTEIN</a>&nbsp;(1931),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-CAT-AND-THE-CANARY/dp/B000V3IX82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE CAT AND THE CANARY</a>&nbsp;(1927) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HUNCHBACK-OF-NOTRE-DAME/dp/B000TEUSI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME</a>&nbsp;(1923).

WHITE ZOMBIE was filmed in 11 days, but it doesn't look rushed. Although a serious attempt to craft a good thriller was made, between its overdramatic music and simply bad acting by almost all who have lines, the end result is too often amusing rather than scary. But to be fair, here is the absolute start of the zombie movie genre. It probably also holds the record for close-ups of a single actor's eyes, that is until Sergio Leone got rolling in the 1960s.

For all its faults and shortcomings, WHITE ZOMBIE's cliffside finale is worth the wait, which in its current state is only an hour.",1448668800,,3249,6.389521640091116

People, we're told, are less apt to dig up your corpse and turn you into a zombie if the casket is constantly being driven over.  Regardless, it made for a suitably weird and creepy start to a tale of covetousness.  A couple of guys are severely taken by supposed beauty Madeleine (played by a comatose Madge Bellamy, which made her perfect for this role as she spends most of the movie as a zombie).  They want her in the worst way possible and that's just how they get her, coffin and all.  Oddly enough, they wait until after she marries a poor sap (John Harron as Neil Parker, the worst actor of the lot) before they spirit her away to a castle painted high on a fake cliff.  After that, Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi) and evil plantation owner Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer) fight over who gets the brain-dead beauty.  Seriously, she just sits around staring into space with her blank Kewpie doll eyes.  Meanwhile, her husband the sap mourns her loss and literally sees her puss in shadows on the wall.  He's comforted by Dr. Bruner the local missionary (Joseph Cawthorn).  The doctor tells him she's not dead, just zombie-fied.  The sap quickly disputes that claim.  ""I kissed her as she lay in the coffin!  And her lips were cold!""  Sage advice, stop kissing corpses.

This movie was both fun and sinister (thanks entirely to Bela Lugosi who could do creepy like none other).  I also have to applaud the cinematographer Arthur Martinelli for composing some of the best shots seen in film at that time.  He employed a lot of interesting techniques to get the point across (love the shot of the grave robbers seen from the point of view inside the niche of the crypt).

332856,5,6301394542,"Update to my original review:
I was dead wrong about the digital enhancement. It looks terrible on Blu ray. The DVD looked OK at first, but now that I'm into Blu ray, the digital enhancement has taken away so much detail it's ridiculous.
However, the ""raw"", non-enhanced version of the film, included as a bonus, is the best print out there. Tons of detail that's just gone from the digitally enhanced version.
There's also a Blu ray from the Roan group, but it lacks detail. In fact, it looks like a cheap DVD that's been transferred to Blu ray.

So buy the KINO blu ray and go straight to the ""extras"" to watch the raw version. You won't regret it.

And now, back to my original review; I've removed any praise for the digital enhancement:
*****************************
If you're not into the horror films from the early thirties, this isn't going to change your mind.

But if you're into classic horror films, then this is the definitive edition of ""White Zombie"", and you need to own it.
The ""raw"" version looks as good as the masters for ""Frankenstein"" or ""Dracula"".

There are a few scenes which were taken from a subpar 16mm print. That's all that exists, so don't blame KINO.

Lastly, as to my ""White Zombie"" expertise:

1) I first saw this film in the seventies at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge. It was stuck in my brain forever. Sheer poetry, even when weighed down with some god-awful bad cinema (like Lugosi's face in the wine glass).

2) Then it was available in the eighties on cheap VHS tapes from everywhere. It was barely watchable, but watchable nonetheless.

3) Then the Roan Group came out with a restored version on laserdisc. It was from a 35mm print, which I assume is the same print for this current release. A great fog had been lifted from the film. I was hooked forever.

4) Someone bought Roan (who had done great work in the preceding decade) and transferred their prints to DVD. Again, they were the best. They included a quote from me on the DVD sleeve, but spelled my name wrong. But I loved them anyway.

5) Then I watched this Kino blu ray disc. Game over. This is the best print you'll ever see of this great film - Lugosi in his prime. Buy it before it's gone. This is a classic of thirties horror - one of perhaps a dozen.",1369526400,9,2266,4.478155339805825
332857,4,6301394542,"""White Zombie""(1932) is directed by Victor Halperin, and stars Bela Lugosi who starred in Dracula (1931). This is considered the first Zombie film though sleep walkers appeared in the German expressionist film ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari""(1919), and a reanimated corpse appeared in the 1910 film ""Frankenstein"".

This Kino release of the film has been digitally remastered with most of the dirt and scratches removed, though I still wished that some of the contrast could have been improved upon. In the special features the original film is again presented in 1080p but without being remastered. This has pluses and minuses. The plus is that the unmastered version seems to have better detail and texture than the remastered version, but it also has all of the scratches.

The extras also include a short six minute interview with Bela Lugosi, and audio commentary by film historian Frank Thompson.",1366243200,,900,5.157534246575342

332859,5,6301394542,"Kino has done a great job on this. My previous copy on tape was murky, with no shadow detail while Kino's restoration looks very good. This is a great early Bela Lugosi film, just before he became ensnared in a string of ""B"" movies. Highly recommended.",1362873600,3,252,4.5
332860,5,6301394542,"I picked up ""White Zombie"" from Kino Classics since they boasted a newly cleaned version from the original negatives.  Bela Lugosi, fresh from his hits ""Dracula"" and ""Murder at the Rue Morgue"" amongst others, he puts a fresh face on the then-new class of mystery films.

Madeline is about to be married to her fianc Neil.  She met this guy on a boat who turns out to be a rich fella who happens to own a spooky castle in the Mountains of Haiti, a land filled with zombies and such.  This guy Beaumont falls for her and does not want her to go through with the marriage.  He gets the help of a zombie master, Legendre, who has other plans.  He already has an army of zombies working the sugar plantation.  Why not a cute girl who wears veils?  Why not indeed!

The story is slow-paced, but is filled with the occasional shocker.  The zombies in this film are not of the ""Romero"" clan, but are actually living people, who through hypnosis and drugs, find themselves under the thrall of Legendre.  Legendre's motives are not that clear, except perhaps he just likes to play games and wants to create horror just because he can.

I also enjoyed the character of Dr. Bruner, played well by Joseph Cawthorn.  He plays the wise man to the nave fianc, Neil, who is grieving over the death of his new wife.  Except, as the good doctor expounds, ""she's not dead!""

The sugar plantation plant with the zombies in tow, the clear sounds and clearly contrasted black & white, make a great film.  The only real complaint is that vulture: quite a screech!

DVD:

The DVD has an interesting interview with Lugosi at his house, which is scripted and makes for some fun yet insight into Lugosi at the height of his career.  There is a gallery of colored movie lobby cards and the usual language and chapter features.  I especially enjoyed comparing the ""Raw"" version to the cleaned-up version of the film.

Bottom Line:  Great horror for the time, has some corny moments, but overall a great product by Kino Classics.  Definitely recommended, especially for the Lugosi fan.

332862,5,6301394542,"In his excellent commentary on White Zombie, Frank Thompson points out how key to this film are the quality of its visuals. In this respect alone (and there are others) I found the Kino Blu-ray restoration to be a revelation. The camera work, set decoration, and lighting are as sharply detailed, vibrant, and expressive as as one could wish a presentation of this 1932 film to be. The beat-up print included in the disc has its charms, but only perhaps in the context that Thompson discusses the acting -- a left-handed appeal, one that adds to the surreality of this most surreal of horror films. That may be true of the acting (as Thompson points out, it's a short hop for Madge Bellamy's character from unzombie to zombie), but the dimensions added by this Blu-ray transfer illuminate the visual poetry of the film in ways never seen before.

To echo one Amazon reviewer, I'm not expert on transfer quality either, but I found that watching this Blu-ray was a delight. It was to experience anew a film I've seen countless times. I would say the same of Frank Thompson's commentary. It is simultaneously expert and relaxed, fluid and incisive. He has done his homework and at once educates, enlightens, and entertains. One feels that Thompson is speaking to his listener, never down to him or her. Many of his comments are couched in a gentle, respectful humor that amplifies what he is speaking of within the film and never detracts or draws attention to itself.

At least for this viewer, this White Zombie and Mr. Thompson's commentary are indeed as good as it gets. I think it's well worth buying -- a disc to treasure.",1361059200,2,1626,4.701754385964913
332863,5,6301394542,"Victor and Edward Halperin's 1932 independent production, WHITE ZOMBIE, is widely regarded by anyone who is well versed in screen horror as one of the best films of the genre. Made at the same time Universal was having phenomenal success with their first monster cycle, WHITE ZOMBIE has the appearance of a Universal production itself since it utilized that studio's sets from THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME (1923), DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN (both 1931). This, along with some really creative cinematography and an effective music track make WHITE ZOMBIE seem like it cost a lot more than its modest budget allowed. Add horror great Bela Lugosi as the evil leader of an army of zombies, and the result is a film worthy to be placed among the masterpieces of the macabre.

Lugosi is ""Murder"" Legendre, a satanic practitioner of voodoo in Haiti who agrees to help a plantation owner (Frank Frazer) get possession of his agent's (John Harron) young bride (Madge Bellamy), only to betray him by turning the girl into a zombie to serve his own evil ends. Along with his signature role as Count Dracula, Lugosi's Legendre is one of the actor's  most memorable characterizations. With a pointed widow's peak, bushy eyebrows, split moustache and goatee (courtesy makeup master Jack Pierce), Lugosi is the very personification of all that is sinister. It's a terrific performance, conveyed through expression, gesture, and vocal cadence.

The first true zombie film, WHITE ZOMBIE is sometimes criticized for its melodramatic acting style, but this is actually one of the reasons why the movie works so well. Everything about it seems dreamlike and other worldly, and this includes the stylized performances which blend right into the marvelous gothic atmosphere of the piece. The long stretches without dialog evokes the eloquence of silent cinema. There's a poetic quality to WHITE ZOMBIE that makes it unique among other horror films of the time.

Kino/Lorber's Blu-ray of WHITE ZOMBIE offers us a brand new, restored version transferred from a 35mm fine grain print with a few brief scenes taken off 16mm elements. Included also is an unenhanced version that retains the natural film grain. While the digitally restored version does give the illusion of pristine quality, the image is compromised by burned out whites and a slightly smeary look. However, this is more noticeable close up and not as much from a comfortable viewing distance. Also, the film is brighter and cleaner, minus all the white specks and scratches. On the other hand, the downside of DNR is apparent when you watch the raw version which, by comparison, has more visible detail and whites don't burn out. The soundtrack's hiss and pop isn't as obtrusive on the restored version as it is on the raw version. Even though it's not perfect, this release of WHITE ZOMBIE blows away anything we've seen before on this title.

Extra features include an enlightening commentary by film historian Frank Thompson, a 1932 interview with Bela Lugosi, the 1951 re-issue trailer and a stills gallery.

They do not have to be ""perfect"" to satisfy my need for a good print. What is frustrating with this Kino edition of ""White Zombie"" is that they nearly succeeded in producing a near-perfect restoration of this film but somehow managed to blow out the white levels. I am no video expert, but I recognize flaring. Certain white areas of the picture bloom, creating unnecessary haloing. This disc comes with an unaltered presentation of the 35mm print that was restored. The white problem is not there, or is less intense. One notes immediately how well Kino cleaned up the print - it is nearly spotless - some say they over-scrubbed the grain right out of the picture. I can live with that but the flaring white areas are distracting. Overall I can't deny that this is the best this picture has ever looked in video. If you are a fan, get it.

In truth, Beaumont wants to get closer to Madeleine in hopes of stealing her away and marrying her himself. When she rejects his advances, he turns to local Voodoo prince ""Murder"" Legendre (Bela Lugosi). Legendre (whose sugar mine is staffed with the walking dead) gives Beaumont a drug that will make Madeleine his. The drug, however, puts Madeleine into a death-like coma which, when Legendre brings her out of it, will turn Madeleine into Beaumont's mindless slave.

Neil (John Harron), distraught over his loss, turns to Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn), the missionary who married the Parkers, and together they realize what's happened and set out to rescue Neil's wife.

Now this is the kind of zombie movie I've been dying to see. I'm not sure how it is Hollywood's managed to distort the idea of zombies from mindless slaves to flesh-eating monsters, but for a long time I've wanted to see zombies done the way they're supposed to be. Granted, this version of the zombie isn't as terrifying as the one who'll eat you, but with the right story, they can still be made threatening.

WHITE ZOMBIE was released in 1932, and it shows. The quality is horrible in spots, there are jumps in dialogue where you can tell cuts were made. The actors are all too white--obviously wearing make-up for the black and white film stock. The effects are limited to a couple of double exposures and a bullet-hole appearing in one zombie's stomach, but for all the old-time cheesiness, this is a hell of a good horror movie.

The zombies Legendre controls are creepy as hell. Silent working machines with blank stares, you get the feeling they're capable of anything, and given they're controlled by a man called ""Murder"", you believe ""anything"" is exactly what they'll do.

The principles, Bellamy, Harron, and Frazer, all give fine performances--fine for 1932. Frazer and Harron over-emote a bit (okay, Harron hams it up, but at least Frazer keeps it under control), while Bellamy plays her dual role--willful Madeleine, then zombie Madeleine--very well. Lugosi, however . . . once again Lugosi is his own worst enemy. The Lugosi stare is back in full effect in this movie. I sometimes find it funny when actors rely so heavily on one aspect of their performance to carry them through most of their roles, then complain when they're typecast. And Lugosi as a Haitian? I think not.

But even with Bela ""I played Dracula, then beat that horse to death the rest of my career"" Lugosi, WHITE ZOMBIE succeeds where so many other ""classic horror"" movies fail. It tells a good story, it makes sense, and in places it creeps you out. And despite a running time of a mere 69 minutes, we still get to know enough about the characters and their situation to care when Neil is backed up against the ledge overlooking the ocean with half a dozen zombies shambling toward him.

I was surprised by WHITE ZOMBIE. After the previous 3 Lugosi movies (BLACK DRAGONS, THE INVISIBLE GHOST, and ONE BODY TOO MANY), I'd given up hope of finding a good one. And while he's far from the best thing here, the overall experience is a rewarding one. Finally, a zombie movie about actual zombies, and it offers a few honestly unsettling moments, which is more than I can say for most of the other horror movies I've seen in the last 5 years.

WHITE ZOMBIE just might be strong enough to become a Halloween tradition. It's that good.",1343260800,,3670,4.714508580343214

These zombies were gainfully employed at the sugar mill. Young Bela boasts an ""Eddie Munster"" hair style, pointy ears, manicured eyebrows, and a goatee. Along with his superimposed eyes he has come to epitomize evil. He is the one who actually creates zombies in what is now a campy film from a former horror classic.

Madge Bellamy stars in the title role, a bride, abducted by another man and turned into a zombie. The ending wasn't exactly a cliff hanger. A good movie to watch with ""Reefer Madness"" if you catch my drift.",1331769600,,699,4.637096774193548

The first film on zombie-making featuring Bela Lugosi relies on conceptual subtleties and lots of atmosphere. For those who have read something about this 'cultural' horror, the subtlety of the dialogue is alternately informative, suggestive, and chilling. I suggest Maya Deren and Wade Davis on the topic of zombification for two different points of view. The hero of the film, Dr. Bruner, was my great-grand-uncle Joseph Cawthorne, and it was very gratifying to hear him cite Napoleonic criminal code on zombie-making in the colonies...  The horrific strategies of Murder Legendre in relation to the municipal authorities is totally hilarious. Reminds me of State & Local antics in the U.S. and abroad. This film manages to be low-key, extreme, horrifying and hilarious at the same time, perhaps mildly generating a sense of social dissociation and disorientation associated with the topic at hand. No wonder Mme. Blavatsky's mentors emphatically advised her not to set foot in a realm of 'black magic' that would have been below her capacity to intuit at once - one step beyond Their Ray of protection.
I wonder sometimes how the current zombie craze among the young relates to our 'addiction society' which demands an inhuman capacity to tolerate its 'repuglican' political and workplace norms and a superhuman capacity to maintain an attitude of non-reactivity in order to survive its palaeo-con ghetto-state and 'tea-party' plantation-state flavours of democracy. Perhaps one key can be found in the various meanings of the term ""one-percenter"" found in several U.S. subcultures. Perhaps another is the corporate totalitarianism of the pharmaceutical drug dealers and the monstrous cancer of gene-altering Monsanto...

332911,3,6301394542,"WHITE ZOMBIE

White Zombie will never hold the distinction of being a great horror movie, but it deserves respect for being possibly the first zombie film ever made, as well as for some creepy scenes, great background, and of coarse, Bela Lugosi.  Most critics have severely thrashed this film for it's obvious flaws, but I feel that it has been unjustly bashed for it's poor production and acting.  I think this is because it happened to be released during the golden age of Universals classic films like Dracula and Frankenstein, and people were simply expecting more from it.

From the start, we are dropped into a fantastical atmospheric field.  The movie begins with two lovers in a carriage moving along a dark road in Haiti.  The chants and songs of voodoo practitioners fills the air, and within the first 5 minutes we see our first zombies, and receive a quick introduction to the zombie master--LeGendre, who is played by Lugosi.  It's no coincidence that the zombie master has made an appearance, for we learn he is on special assignment from a local planter to use his magic to steal away the young bride to be for himself.  Naturally, one should never consort with someone who practices the black arts, and the zombie master quickly turns the screws on the wealthy planter with the intent of adding the young girl to his stable of zombies.

LeGendre goes to work in an elaborate ceremony, and the girl sickens and dies.  The body is stolen from her tomb with the intent of making her into a zombie sex-slave for the wealthy planter.  Meanwhile, the young groom to be drinks his sorrows away until the veil is lifted by a local friend who knows all too well the secrets of the zombie master.  Together they resolve to gain back the girl before she becomes one of the walking dead.  This means they will have to enter the land of the dead and face not only the zombie master, whose magic powers are strong, but also his zombie minions.

While some of the acting in this movie is over the top, I don't feel that it detracts substantially from the positive aspects of the film.  Oddly enough, the way it is acted and shot, it feels more like a silent picture and one must wonder if the advent of sound was still too new for the director.  But remember, it's a low budget movie, so use your imagination and let the little things slide a bit, and you'll find you enjoy this movie a lot more.

The films greatest asset is the superb atmospheric setting it establishes.  There is an air of evil and oppression throughout the film created by the dark lighting, strange images, and sounds.  The constant screeching of the zombie master's pet vulture is one instance.  Probably the spookiest scene is at the zombie master's sugar refinery, staffed by zombies of coarse, with the constant and awful sound of the sugar wheel as it is operated by zombie drones.  We also get to see the procedure of the zombie making process which is quite chilling.  Unlike most portrayals, it is not a quick or spontaneous action, but rather a painful metamorphoses.

Lugosi is great as the zombie master, and his performance deserves some attention.  While he plays the Dracula role in many ways, Lugosi does redefine the part  and is pretty convincing.  As the zombie master, he exudes evil and in many ways surpasses what he did in Dracula.  He still uses that famous gaze on his victims, but rather than just biting people, he's going around performing black magic, grave robbing, necrophilia(implied attempt), and a host of other transgressions, a really evil character who I think could give Dracula a lot of competition.  It's a lot of fun to watch the zombie master playing with the living as though they were already dead and it makes the character all that more repulsive.

So whether you want to see the first zombie picture for its historical place in film, or because you want to see a really great film, you should give this a go.  BEWARE:  all versions of this public domain film are of inferior quality, so until Criterion re-masters it, you have to deal with poor audio and visual.",1317772800,3,4082,4.635605006954103

This is the eerie tale of a newlywed couple who has come to live in Haiti, the alleged walking dead forced to work the fields at night, a local rich man who becomes enamored of the bride-to-be and wants her for himself, whatever the means, and finally Lugosi, the local master of voodoo that the rich man comes to in order to get his heart's desire. Lugosi gives a great performance here akin to his performance in Dracula, and there is even the wise elder man of science who tries to make sense of it all, much as Edward Van Sloan did in Dracula and in The Mummy. The difference here is that the case is being made for that which looks like the supernatural actually having a basis in science rather than vice versa.

Rich in atmosphere, this is highly recommended. Make sure to get the ROAN release of this public domain property, as it is the best transfer I've seen even if it is ten years old.",1235779200,,1067,4.36180904522613

332980,5,6301394542,"Considering the genre, time period, and star actor, it's always tempting to compare ""White Zombie"" to the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Monster-movies/dp/B0001CNRNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Monster movies</a>.  However, while ""White Zombie"" is on par with the best of these films, it's also extraordinarily different.  The Universal classics (""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"", ""The Wolf Man"", etc) tend to be relatively simple stories, often with a fascinating, easily identifiable monster at the center.  ""White Zombie"" rejects that mold, offering something far more poignant and (at the same time), far less recognizable than the spirit-gummed prosthetic faces of the Universal monsters.

The plot is far more complex than what you normally get in a Universal monster film, including a conscious-laden villain with a relatively well developed back-story and a somewhat elaborate reason for bringing the undead into the plot line.  In a sense, Charles Beaumont becomes the protagonist of this film, far more compelling and likeable than the naive couple he seeks to destroy.  We can certainly empathize with his belief that he is a better suitor for Madeleine than her vapid, weak-willed fianc.  We understand and almost condone the passion that drives him, even when we know that his actions are wrong and will lead to terrible consequences.  Because of this, by the time we get to the wedding ceremony, it becomes obvious that there can be no happy resolution at the close of ""White Zombie""- only an end to suffering.  I'd like to see a Universal monster film tackle that level of tragedy and emotional complexity.  ""Frankenstein"" comes close, but even James Whale's brilliant work pales in comparison with ""White Zombie"" on certain dramatic levels (most notably the resolution).

Additionally, the supernatural presence in this film is far more alien and terrifying than what you find in most classic monster films, neither as civilized and inoffensive as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B000GPIPSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>"" nor as humane and misunderstood as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B000GPIPT2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>"".  Bela Lugosi, as the truly evil, remorseless, and cunning zombie master, is a terrifying force on the screen.  He doesn't kill out of fear, hunger, or instinct.  He does it because it suits his purpose.  Of course, the band of undead that he commands is even more terrifying; even more inhuman and single-minded than its master.  There is no one to reason with or beg to, here, and there is no well-documented weakness to use against this seemingly unstoppable force.  The evil in this film is an immoral presence that does not stop to plan, worry, or second guess itself.  Therein lies true classic terror.

I truly believe ""White Zombie"" is an obscure classic today, not because it is in some way inferior to other horror classics of the time, but rather because it lacks one clearly defined, visually memorable monster.  Though I believe this was the greatest role of his career, Lugosi's human-looking zombie master was never going to get an Aurora model kit, nor were the undead people he commanded.  There was no elaborate make-up or trade-mark outfit that kids could easily associate with the zombies in this film.  These monsters look liked they belonged in the real world, like something you could see on the way home from the theater, instead of looking like something out of a fantasy realm of spirit-gum and prosthetics.  This low budget realism made the film less marketable, but also potentially more terrifying than its contemporaries.

""White Zombie"" is a rich and brilliant horror film, compensating for its lack of flashy make-up and effects with strong production value, a compelling location (""uncivilized"" Haiti), great atmosphere, a tragic storyline, and a terrifying enemy.  If you respect classic horror films for their artistry and creativity as opposed to their mass-marketed camp appeal, than ""White Zombie"" is most certainly a film that you need to see.

Regarding available versions of this film, I strongly recommend the Roan Group edition.  While cheaper editions feature adequate quality images, the sound is nearly indecipherable in many places on these transfers, even with the volume turned all the way up.  While the Roan Group edition is a relatively old transfer, it's still the best one available that I know of.  The sound is much better here, clear enough so that understanding the dialogue is effortless during most points in the film.  I understand that Amazon is offering a new ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timeless-Classics/dp/B000853QN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timeless Classics</a>"" restoration of the film that appears quite costly, but I don't know anything about it.  Nevertheless, I feel confident in endorsing the Roan Group edition. I have absolutely no complaints with it.",1217894400,6,5111,5.765645805592543

By today's standards, the look of the movie is quite archaic.  The scenes jump and seem to be cut together at certain points, but it takes away very little from the movie.  The acting is somewhat hokey, but again, the plot makes up for it.  Upon watching this movie reminded me of the original Nosferatu, though this movie does have sound.

Bela Lugosi, in a very early role, barely recognizable if you ask me, portrays a 'Prince of Darkness' character.  He is able, through voodoo, to create zombies and have them under his control.  A plantation owner comes to him and begs him to help him win the heart of a women who is betrothed to another.  Soon after the wedding the bride falls dead, or does she?  It seems that Lugosi has been able to make her fall into a coma-like state and later with the assistance of zombies, and the plantation owner, they steal her body from the crypt.

332982,3,6301394542,"White Zombie (Victor Halperin, 1932)

Back when I was a monster-movie-obsessed kid and I thought Edward Edelson was the world's greatest author, monster-movie books were still politically incorrect, and White Zombie was one of the most oft-mentioned ""if you like zombies, this film is a must-see"" flicks. Well, people got more sensitive in the eighties, and White Zombie kind of faded into obscurity; I doubt you'll be seeing a Criterion Collection release of this one any time soon. The cheapo-DVD manufacturing crowd fell on it like gangbusters when it hit the public domain, however, and you can probably find it for a buck or two at your local Half Price Books or Wal-Mart in a cardboard sleeve. That's how I got hold of my copy (for a buck and a half!).

White Zombie, made at the height of both Victor Halperin's and Bela Lugosi's careers, is the tale of Murder Legendre (Lugosi), a plantation owner/witch doctor who uses mind control to turn those around him into zombies. Charles Beaumont (prolific silent film actor Robert Frazer) lures a friend, Neil Parker (character actor John Herron) and his fiancee, Madeline Short (Madge Bellamy), out to his plantation for their marriage, then plots with Legendre to turn Madeline into a zombie so Beaumont can have her for himself. Once Beaumont realizes that she's no fun without her personality, he wants Legendre to reverse the process; nothing doing, chum, says Legendre. Meanwhile, Neil and a local missionary (Joseph Cawthorn) and looking for Madeline, who as far as they know simply disappeared.

Very nice atmosphere to this one, somehow dirtier and more real (despite, of course, the presence of Bela Lugosi as a witch doctor) than Tourneur's later I Walked with a Zombie. The plot is simpler, but Halperin makes it work nicely, and Lugosi is at his creepy best. Recommended. ***",1207008000,,1839,4.98371335504886
332983,5,6301394542,"Beautiful Madeleine Short and her fiance' Neil Parker travel the twisting roads of Haiti to acquaintance Charles Beaumont's plantation in a cortege' to be wed, when they briefly meet one Mr. Legendre {Lugosi} along the way, who absconds with her scarf, a remnant of her person, and the horror begins. The carriage driver regails them with the local legends of zombies, and when a group of these living dead amble about Legendre down from the black hills, they are struck with an uneasy terror and speedily make their way to Beaumont's plantation, where they are met by a pipe-smoking Dr. Bruner.

However, seems the cleverly traitorous Beaumont essentially made a deal with The Devil by employing the necromantic services of Legendre, to possess Madeleine for his very own zombie love slave. But in order to achieve this end, she must 'die' first, or enter into a narcoleptic coma with her mind in a spell.

Beaumont gets to see the secret caverns where Legendre keeps his native slaving zombies at the creeking mill reminiscent of the proles from Metropolis, and is also introduced to Legendre's various primary zombies: There's Chauvin the executioner {who almost executed Legendre}, a large monster of a man with a piercing glare; Ledot, Legendre's former instructor still in ceremonial attire; Von Gelder, the former tyrannical dictator of the isle; and Silver the zombie butler.

Quite remarkably, Legendre works his dark art by fashioning a waxen fetish figure carved right from a candle, wrapped in her scarf, and improvisationally burns it in a lantern's flame. Here is where Lugosi gestures that infamous hand gesticulation to gain control of her consciousness.

Meanwhile, Parker plunges into despair and becomes enebriated at a local bar, eventually stumbling over to her grave while she is being extracted by Legendre and his zombies. Upon discovering her body missing, he screams in anguish. Now seeking the aid of Dr. Bruner {who really should invest in a lighter}, a sort of Van-Helsing type, he becomes elucidated about the zombie tales, and prepares to visit Legendre at his magnificent cliff-side castle.

When Beaumont is taken aback by Madeleine's condition, recognizing no personality behind her blank stare, he regrets his decision and begs Legendre to reverse her somnambulism, to his lethal misfortune. Now it is he who ingests the zombie powder, while Legendre ghoulishly savors each moment of his degeneration, even fashioning the effigy right in front of him - the only one among all the zombies who actually realizes what is happening to him.

For a brief moment, Madeleine seemingly recognizes Beaumont through the haze, but Legendre regains control. Unfortunately, while she walks outside, Beaumont summons one last vestige of effort and takes Legendre with him over the cliff's edge, followed by his other zombies. The spell is broken, and the fiance's are reunited. Lesson: always leave someone in charge of whomever is in the next room!

Subsequent to Dracula, Lugosi played a remarkable role with this remarkable character, which also remains an inspirational model of deportment and determination. A veritable 'devil as a gentleman'.

White Zombie is replete with splendid camera angles {inclusive of mesmerizing close-ups}, lambent and contrasting lighting techniques, morbid, shadowy sets, striking vistas, eerie orchestration*, and memorable scenes sure to secure a treasured spot in one's collection, as well as in one's mind.

* It should also be noted that at times, silence itself is ingeniously utilized to intensify the forboding atmosphere this film manages to create.",1195603200,2,3623,5.276041666666667
333024,4,6301394542,"This movie, which I believe was the first zombie movie ever released, relies a lot on shadow and mood rather than action, which is sporadic, though intense.  This film often bores fans of modern film because they expect action to dull them into senselessness rather than getting into the atmosphere of a film.  Fans of classic movies will enjoy the texture of the film and the creepy feeling the film does a very good job of instilling.

Madeleine Short (Madge Bellamy) and Neil Parker (John Harron, who appeared in minor roles in dozens of movies until his untimely death in 1939) have journeyed to Haiti to get married.  Once there, their host Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer, who appeared in dozens of movies, though many of his roles were uncredited) falls madly in love with Madeleine.  Beaumont turns to Murder Legendre (Bela Lugosi, who one year earlier created the standard for all future Dracula wannabes) for assistance.  Legendre is a zombie master, and uses his abilities to turn Madeleine into a zombie.

Neil Parker is beside himself with grief because he thinks Madeleine is dead, but her death is only in appearance because of the drugs that Legendre used.  Parker discovers that Madeleine may be alive, and enlists the aid of missionary Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorn) to track her down and rescue her.

Though the end of the movie has some measure of predictability, the value of this movie is in the journey and not the destination.  The movie has an eerie quality throughout, partially due to the sets and partially due to cinematography.  Bela Lugosi's piercing eyes are prominent and with a big screen television it is easy to see how intimidating his eyes can be.  This movie used techniques that were ground-breaking at the time, including split screens and overlays.  I am not sure how the director created the view of the castle, but the beach scenes featuring the castle were outstanding considering this movie was filmed in 1932.  The result of all these features is that the movie is very artistic and interesting to watch.

""White Zombie"" is a relatively slow movie that relies almost completely on atmosphere.  The action is limited to brief moments, though intensity is important.  For example, there is a scene with a zombie falling into a grinder.  The scene is very graphic and the sound effects are realistic and disturbing.  Fans of gothic horror, Bela Lugosi and zombie movies will find this movie a treat and one they will want in their collection.

Use caution in buying this movie.  I know that many people have tried, and failed, to get a good copy of this movie off the internet.  For some reason the sound off these copies is poor.  This movie is one that you should probably purchase as a DVD if you wish to have it in your collection.  Other reviewers consider the version by the Roan Group to be the best available version, and it is (currently) cheaper than this version.  I have not seen the Roan Group version myself, so I take this assertion based on the expertise of reviewers who have seen both versions.  You may wish to do a bit of research before deciding which version meets your needs the best.

333025,5,6301394542,"A diabolical voodoo master plots to turn a beautiful young American into a WHITE ZOMBIE, a slave of his perverted passions...

Here is one of the great unheralded horror classics of the 1930's. Almost forgotten today, it is an excellent example of what can be accomplished by an obscure film company (in this case Halperin Productions) working with a tiny budget, but using enormous flair & imagination. Some of the visuals - the opening scene of the burial on the road, the sugar mill worked by zombies - remain in the imagination for an uncomfortable amount of time, one sure sign of true success for a horror film. Certain of the settings - the hillside graveyard, the villain's towering fortress - are as good as you'll find anywhere. Additionally, the moody music of Xavier Cugat & the make-up wizardry of Jack Pierce help tremendously.

But it's the performance of Bela Lugosi, looking utterly satanic, which is truly memorable. Released the year following his celebrated Dracula, WHITE ZOMBIE gives him another character which, in measures of pure menace, is easily the equal of the Count. With his mesmeric eyes, expressive, spider-like hands & wonderfully eerie voice, Lugosi radiates absolute evil. This talented Austro-Hungarian actor (born Bla Ferenc Dezs Blask, 1882-1956) would fritter away much of his career in low-budget dregs, but here he must have realized he was in competent hands and he is obviously having a wonderful time. To see his imposing, cloaked figure stalk about the screen, closely followed by his Living Dead slaves, is to enjoy one of cinema's most deliciously spooky moments.

Madge Bellamy & John Harron are both impressive as Lugosi's victims. Robert Frazer is very good indeed as the plantation owner whose obsession for Miss Bellamy throws him right into Lugosi's clutches. Elderly Joseph Cawthorn scores as the aged missionary who may be the only person wise enough to thwart the zombie master. Movie mavens will recognize an uncredited Clarence Muse as the frightened coach driver in the opening sequence.",1184976000,,2047,5.104477611940299

He wants her back to normal, but Bela has other ideas. He wants the loser to be a slave in the sugar mill too! But the groom comes to the rescue and the loser and Bela take a long walk off a short cliff.

The interesting thing about this movie is Bela himself. It seems they couldn't decide what he should look like, so he is half Dracula and half Charlie Chan. I lost count how many times he does the 'Dracula stare' into the camera, but I guess audiences loved it and it's what Bela did best.

333074,5,6301394542,"Sometimes silly, sometimes stilted, nearly always stagey, White Zombie remains nonetheless one of the most visually fascinating films in horror history. Who can forget the image of Madge Bellamy's alabaster gown flowing down the concrete staircase, or the zombie burial procession outlined spectrally against the sky, or the sinister shadows cast demonically across a dance floor. Then there's the magnificently gothic  hall with its grotesquely twisted bannister like none other I've seen. In fact, almost every scene presents at least one arresting visual feature. As good as these and the many other touches are, it's still the mill scene that remains a masterpiece of visual staging. It must be seen to be appreciated-- the pitiless grind of the crusher, the soundless shuffle circling into the maw-- all in all, one of the deeper levels of Dante's inferno and one that's bound to stay with you.

If the visuals are inspired, the acting is not. It's almost as if two different people are in charge. Bellamy is quite good with her large liquid eyes and bee-stung lips. Her transformation into a zombie stupor is well performed. Of course, there's also Lugosi as Lugosi, florid, hammy, but effective nonetheless. The other principals, however, bring down the proceedings with what can only be described as bad acting. Bellamy's swain in particular is plain annoying, while the preacher appears to have wandered in from a breezy Bing Crosby production. Too bad. With more appropriate performances this could have been an all-time classic.

As things stand, it's a truly memorable film, whose influence can be seen in such diverse venues as Val Lewton's horror cycle, Bergman's The Seventh Seal, and Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Except for the mill scene with its eerily grinding tonality, the movie might be best enjoyed by turning off the sound altogether. (P. S. Colorizing this b&w marvel is nothing less than a crime.)",1155772800,6,1929,5.117460317460317
333075,5,6301394542,"The term ""Zombie"" and the concepts it conveyed did not really enter American conciousness until the publication of William B. Seabrook's THE MAGIC ISLAND in 1929--but once established, it fired popular imagination, producing everything from a host of pulp fiction shorts to a fairly lethal mixture of rum and tropical juices. Released in 1932, THE WHITE ZOMBIE is generally considered to be the first motion picture on the subject--and it would pretty much set pop culture ideas about zombies, voodoo, and Hati for decades to come.

The film is interesting in several respects, not least of which is the fact that it an independent production, something rare indeed for a film of its era. Unfortunately, this fact also gave rise to a series of legal battles between writer Kenneth S. Webb and producers Edward and Victor Halperin. What with one thing or another the film itself was considered lost from about 1935 until it resurfaced in 1960, when it once more touched off another legal battle between the same parties and their estates. In consequence, and although it has indeed turned up at special screenings and on the late-late show, the film has never really been widely seen since its 1932 debut--and most of the prints available were pretty dire. This was certainly the case when I saw the film in a ""big screen"" film festival in the late 1970s: the sound was poor, the visuals worse, and it was very difficult to tell what all the fuss was about.

Fortunately for fans of 1930s horror, THE WHITE ZOMBIE is now available in numerous DVD versions--but it is very much a case of ""buyer beware,"" for most of them are extremely dire.  Roan Group has released an exceptional restoration of the film; PC Treasures has a reasonable budget release in tandem with the cult classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  The Timeless Classics edition falls somewhere between the two: the age of the elements show and it isn't a patch on the Roan edition, but its a darn sight better than most.

As for the film itself, even by 1932 standards THE WHITE ZOMBIE was not a ""screamer"" in the same sense as DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN were; it is instead lyric, at times poetic in nature, disturbing in the same manner of an Edgar Allen Poe poem. The story is quite simple: Madeline Short (Madge Bellamy) and Neil Parker (John Harron) have come to Hati--and en route have met estate owner Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer.) Beaumont falls in love with Madeline; unable to convince her to leave Parker, he goes to zombie master 'Murder' Legendre (Bela Lugosi), who works his evil spell upon her. But Beaumont soon finds himself at odds with Legendre, and Parker, with the aid of missionary Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorne) has set out to rescue Madeline at all costs.

The cast is quite fine, and many critics consider that this is really Lugosi's best performance of the early 1930s, surpassing his more famous turn in DRACULA. Indeed, he is a remarkable presence in the film, ugly and sinister and yet at times--it is difficult to describe--one sees the unexpectedly attractiveness of the man in both physical and psychological terms. It is a memorable performance. But the big thing about THE WHITE ZOMBIE isn't so much the story or the performances as ""how the thing is done.""

The cinematography is simple, but it has a misty quality, and one is always aware of the texture of black and white; shadows are important in the film, and the overall look is quite unlike anything to come out of Hollywood up to that point--and even today it remains largely unique. There is an elegance to the way the scenes are staged and photographed that rarely occurs in any film of any era.

Modern viewers without significant interest in films of this period are likely to find THE WHITE ZOMBIE mannered and a bit slow--but if you have an interest in early sound films, and even more so in horror films of the 1930s, THE WHITE ZOMBIE is an essential in your collection.

333078,4,6301394542,"Close on the heels of portraying the immortal Dracula, Bela Lugosi turned his suave eeriness and trademark powerful stares to 1932's White Zombie. He manages to make an otherwise forgetful horror flick into something worth watching, although I admit I was far from captivated by the movie. It gets off to a promising start. Neil and his fianc Madeleine have to pause on their way to the home of their supposed benefactor when they encounter a nighttime burial in the middle of the road (so no one will tamper with the dead body, you know), then soon meet up with the creepy, mysterious Legrende (Lugosi) and some of his pet zombies. Once they arrive at their destination, their host, Beaumont, confesses his love for Madeleine but finds that his Harry Houdini haircut does not succeed in winning her over. Naturally, he decides to invoke the help of Legrende, who promises Beaumont that there is a way for him to claim her. I'll give you three guesses as to what this involves. Neil runs around half crazy even before discovering that the tomb of his beloved is empty, then manages to get the support of the local missionary in finding his apparently not fully deceased wife. I'm afraid I didn't particularly care for the ending of this film; it's a little too predictable, and Neil's clumsy antics are almost as annoying as the pipe-smoking missionary's repeated requests for a match. There are some interesting little film production techniques here -- split screens, overlays of ghostly images, and the like, but it is the story that seems to come up a little short. Haiti doesn't seem quite the proper setting for Lugosi, but the filmmaker got a lot of terrific mileage out of close-ups on his piercing eyes. Lugosi fans won't want to miss White Zombie, but others may not get much out of the movie.",1116633600,4,1803,4.745222929936306
333079,5,6301394542,"Madeline (Madge Bellamy) and Neil (John Harron) are two young lovers on their way to get married. It's unfortunate for them that they ran into Mr. Beaumont (Robert Frazer- THE VAMPIRE BAT, CONDEMNED TO LIVE), who convinces the couple to travel to his home in Haiti to tie the knot. Once there, things get really weird! Beaumont is so obsessed with Madge that he seeks the help of the local sugar mill owner / voodoo-meister named Murder (!) Legendre (Bela Lugosi- DRACULA, THE RAVEN, PHANTOM SHIP) in captivating and possessing Madge. Well, old Murder has plans of his own, of course, involving his horde of zombie slaves and the potion that stupefies and dehumanizes them. WHITE ZOMBIE is a great movie with a nice, dark subtext about control and the consequences of obsession. Ms. Bellamy radiates innocence and beauty, while Bela is the perfect nemesis, giving stares that could curdle milk!

333080,4,6301394542,"First let me qualify this review as stating it is only for the version by the Roan Group and not any other.  The Roan Group has mastered the best possible print for this 1932 horror film.  Taken from the two best quality 35MM prints as opposed to the 16MM prints you usually see.

The print is very clean and relatively crisp with very little sketchy editing.  The sound does need to be modulated periodically.

Lugosi is just terrific in this movie as the sinister 'Murder' Legrende, Haitian mill owner and zombie master. Robert Fraser plays Charles Beaumont, a local plantation owner who becomes obsessed with a young woman (Madge Bellamy) about to be married.

He invites her and her fiance (John Harron) to his estate to have their wedding all the while planning some way to win her. An hour before the wedding he becomes desperate and reluctantly approaches his sinister neighbour Legrende. Legrende's solution has dire consequences for all involved. T

The movie was obviously made on a shoe string budget but there are plenty of striking visual images, especially those involving Bellamy after Lugosi gets to her. He is at his best looking positively statanic with his mesmerizing eyes and facial expressions.

The zombies are very creepy and are the precursors to zombie classics later made by Tourneur, Romero, Fulci and Raimi. For this and for Lugosi 'White Zombie' is a must see for any horror buff!

What also makes this a big step above other releases is that it comes with an audio commentary by Lugois Scholar Gary Rhoads, and also features two short, but interesting interviews with Lugosi.  One in the early 30's, and one in the mid 50's towards the end of his life.",1092355200,6,1683,4.7923875432525955
333081,3,6301394542,"So warns the Christian missionary to Haiti who helps a young banker save his bride from voodoo-induced thralldom to a plantation owner who has kidnapped her.
In White Zombie the sins were brought to Haiti by European colonizers.
White Zombie (1932) is Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) transposed from an industrial society to the third world.  The Haitian zombies slaving in Legendre's sugar mill are waiting for a Che Guevara, not a Lenin.
In Metropolis a worker in the underground factory below the city continually moves the hands on a giant round clock, a task that doesn't seem to have any purpose.
In White Zombie the undead go round and round in a circle, turning a mill to grind up sugar cane for Legendre, the mill owner who has simplified his labor relations by transforming his workforce into zombies.  One zombie falls from his spot into a vat where he is ground up with the cane.  None of his fellow workers notice; he doesn't even try to save himself as he falls.

Legendre has taken economic and political control of the island by enslaving its elite (the head of the gendarmerie and politicians), in addition to the unskilled peasants who make his sugar.
Legendre gets the living betray their own kind.  Once Madeleine has become a zombie she is tended by maids who obey their master rather than be turned into undead creatures themselves.
Unfortunately for the Haitians, while Madeleine is saved from an eternity of playing Chopin on the piano with a glazed expression, the natives grinding the sugar cane are forgotten at the end.
But once Legendre is out of the way, who will take care of the zombie mill workers and export the sugar?
Maybe Madeleine's husband, the banker, can take over the mill.  Everything will work out.",1089676800,6,1741,4.786666666666667

Lugosi plays the villain well and gives a performance that makes necromancy seem believable (coffee works a similar magic for me in the mornings. Come to think of it, the zombies' undead shuffle is strangely familiar as well.) This movie is not for the average film viewer, but should be in every horror fans collection for its own merits and for its historic perspective as the first zombie movie.",1088553600,3,648,4.743362831858407

I also like very much Lugosi's lair near the sea ! A kind of a castle on the top of a cliff. The interiors are like a cathedral. Even it's sometimes slow paced, you'll never get bored. OK the other actors are not so convincing, but the atmosphere is wonderful creepy. For instance the mill where the zombies worked for Lugosi, the cemetery and don't forget the grazy voodou song at the beginning of the film ! Fans of old fashioned horror movies will find this little gem very delightful.
The quality of this Alpha DVD is quite good. Picture looks fine most of the time, even there are some jumps. The sound is not so great, but still acceptable. It's the perfect film for a saturday evening just before midnight.",1083110400,,888,4.55625
333123,4,6301394542,"There is something about these old, classic black & white horror classics that just can't seem to be recaptured today.  White Zombie is an example of an art that has been lost in modern film making.  The sets are lush and detailed.  The exteriors are dark and gothic.  And let us not forget that there is not substitute for the late, great Bela Lugosi.
Lugosi carries the cast.  He is a small man with a slight frame, but he conveys a sense of evil and menace that chills you.  The rest of the cast are generic 1930's actors.  The female lead is loaded with so much pancake makeup she looks like, well, a white zombie (so I guess that works), and her husband-to-be is your basic, slicked back hair, lipstick wearing vanilla milk sop.  The actors portraying Lugosi's zombie horde were probably cast for their odd, freaky features, but that works too.  But make no mistake, this is Lugosi's film, and it is one of his greatest works along with the original Dracula.
The DVD I am reviewing has no features. NONE. Unless you count chapter selections.  It is full screen, with no audio or video options.  At least it has a good price.  The film looks good with strong contrasts between black and whites.  This makes the night sequences (most of the film) easier to make out.  I owned the video tape before and the darks and lights blended horribly.  This DVD looks good though with an occasional flicker and jump, but I would guess that is the fault of the original film.
Read the Amazon review to get a rundown on the plot.  I just wanted to stress the strengths of the film, the DVD, the style and acting.  They really do not make them like this any more.",1080777600,2,1652,4.4352159468438535
333124,4,6301394542,"The great thing about zombie films is that you don't really need to spend any money on special effects if you don't want to: just the idea of the dead silently moving is horror enough. Many directors with low budgets and great imaginations have thus turned to the genre, producing such classic variations on the theme as I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, and 28 DAYS LATER. But they all owe a debt back to this, probably the first ""true"" zombie film. Fortunately, this Haiti-set film holds up beautifully, with wonderfully evocative images. There's a completely wordless satanic mill, where the silence isn't even broken by the fall of one of the zombies into the great millstone; a haunted ruined castle by the sea like something out of Dor; a vulture that is used to wonderful effect  in the film's last moments; and a beautiful undead heroine stalking around in her filmy negligee. (Inevitably she's named ""Madeleine,"" so her irritating boyfriend can call after her, in BBC tones, ""Oh, Madeleine... Madeleine... oh, Madeleine..."")  Bela Legosi, who was clearly not out for subtlety as the evil zombie master Legendre, is the perfect center figure for this expressionistic nightmare.",1072569600,3,1216,4.955882352941177

The character is cold and unreal, and Lugosi plays it to the hilt.  There is a scene where Lugosi picks up a glass of wine where his hand completely surrounds the top of the glass like a huge spider!

It's obvious that this movie didn't have the budget of those, but it has a lot of heart and charm.  The story revolves around a young couple, a plantation owner, and a zombie master played by Bela Lugosi.  The young couple are to be married, and the plantation owner has invited them to hold their ceremony at his plantation, but he has other plans.  He tries to woo the young lady away, but to no avail.  As a last ditch effort, he enlists the aid of Bela Lugosi.  Well, it turns out that Bela's character has plans for the young woman also.  For the rest, well, you will just have to watch and see....the picture quality on this edition is quite crisp and clear, with a couple of minor distortions here and there.  This is my first time veiwing this movie, and from what I read, this is the best copy available.  The sound quality isn't as good, and I noticed a few drop outs here and there, but considering the age and scarcity of the material, I think the Roan Group did and excellent job in restoring this fine film.  All in all, these minor flaws in quality did nothing to reduce my enjoying the movie.  The sets are amazing and the movie positively exudes atmosphere.

333128,4,6301394542,"Close on the heels of portraying the immortal Dracula, Bela Lugosi turned his suave eeriness and trademark powerful stares to 1932's White Zombie.  He manages to make an otherwise forgetful horror flick into something worth watching, although I admit I was far from captivated by the movie.  It gets off to a promising start.  Neil and his fianc Madeleine have to pause on their way to the home of their supposed benefactor when they encounter a nighttime burial in the middle of the road (so no one will tamper with the dead body, you know), then soon meet up with the creepy, mysterious Legrende (Lugosi) and some of his pet zombies.  Once they arrive at their destination, their host, Beaumont, confesses his love for Madeleine but finds that his Harry Houdini haircut does not succeed in winning her over.  Naturally, he decides to invoke the help of Legrende, who promises Beaumont that there is a way for him to claim her.  I'll give you three guesses as to what this involves.  Neil runs around half crazy even before discovering that the tomb of his beloved is empty, then manages to get the support of the local missionary in finding his apparently not fully deceased wife.  I'm afraid I didn't particularly care for the ending of this film; it's a little too predictable, and Neil's clumsy antics are almost as annoying as the pipe-smoking missionary's repeated requests for a match.  There are some interesting little film production techniques here-split screens, overlays of ghostly images, and the like, but it is the story that seems to come up a little short.  Haiti doesn't seem quite the proper setting for Lugosi, but the filmmaker got a lot of terrific mileage out of close-ups on his piercing eyes.  Lugosi fans won't want to miss White Zombie, but others may not get much out of the movie.",1039219200,,1811,4.772435897435898

The question is whether Beaumont can trust Legendre to carry out his part of the deal and not double cross him.

Bela Lugosi turns in one of his most menacing & effective performances in this film as the malevolent Murder Legendre. It's too bad that Lugosi's legacy is forever linked to DRACULA when he gave an equally compelling performance in this classic.
The zombies looked very menacing for its time. And this movie follows the legend of the zombie more closely than later on incantations made popular by George Romero's classic NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). The next closest interpretation of the zombie legend was probably Jacques Tourneur's masterpiece I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943) but that's another story.",1029542400,2,679,5.181818181818182

But I saw a gem of film underneath those flaws & bought the restored version.  It's worth the small price difference, believe me.  The film itself:  half horror, half camp--is wonderful.  It actually seems less anachronistic than the original Dracula or Frankenstein (those 1930 American fashions and accents) & the acting is quite good.

333153,4,6301394542,"Bela Lugosi gives a stellar performance as the zombie master in White Zombie. This is one of Lugosi's strongest performances and one of his strongest films. White Zombie is consistently entertaining from beginning to end. And that entertainment rises and falls on Lugosi's wonderful ability to breathe life into even the ""deadest"" of roles.
The movie begins with an engaging yet eerie ""Haitian"" funeral song and it is revealed that a burial ceremony is taking place in the middle of the road because so many bodies have been stolen -- no sooner do we learn this than Bela appears with a entourage of zombies. He steals a scarf from the film's ingenue. It seems he has been contracted by a wealthy plantation owner to secure the love of this fair maiden for him. Of course it isn't
long before Bela turns on the wealthy scoundrel and makes him a zombie too.
Of course true love wins in the end and Lugosi is pushed off a cliff by the new zombified planataion owner and the young woman and her handsome beau are free to go get married. . .
But through it all Bela Lugosi makes you believe he is truly capable of controlling the wills of others with his magnificent eyes and powerful imminence. This is the movie that Bela and Ed are watching in the movie Ed Wood -- and he uses the famous interlocking hand gesture that he would later repeat in Bride of the Monster.
White Zombie is my favorite zombie movie -- I realize it doesn't provide he visceral thrills and claustraphobic intensity that Night of the Living ead does -- but it is a more subtle kind of film that focusses on the zombie master rather than his minnions. The film's director knew Bela's strengths as a silent actor and utilizes him to the fullest.
I highly recommend White Zomie to the Bela Lugosi and horror movie fan. It is practically a textbook example of the genre.",1015027200,,1837,4.536144578313253

333155,5,6301394542,"The term ""Zombie"" and the concepts it conveyed did not really enter American conciousness until the publication of William B. Seabrook's THE MAGIC ISLAND in 1929--but once established, it fired popular imagination, producing everything from a host of pulp fiction shorts to a fairly lethal mixture of rum and tropical juices.  Released in 1932, THE WHITE ZOMBIE is generally considered to be the first motion picture on the subject--and it would pretty much set pop culture ideas about zombies, voodoo, and Hati for decades to come.

The film is interesting in several respects, not least of which is the fact that it an independent production, something rare indeed for a film of its era.  Unfortunately, this fact also gave rise to a series of legal battles between writer Kenneth S. Webb and producers Edward and Victor Halperin.  What with one thing or another the film itself was considered lost from about 1935 until it resurfaced in 1960, when it once more touched another legal battle between the same parties and their estates.  In consequence, and although it has indeed turned up at special screenings and on the late-late show, the film has never really been widely seen since its 1932 debut--and most of the prints available were pretty dire.  This was certainly the case when I saw the film in a ""big screen"" film festival in the late 1970s: the sound was poor, the visuals worse, and it was very difficult to tell what all the fuss was about.

Fortunately for fans of 1930s horror, Roan Group has released an exceptional restoration of the film.  The age of the elements show--an inevitability--but the picture and sound quality are the best possible short of a full digital restoration, and the package includes an interesting audio commentary as well.  Simply put, THE WHITE ZOMBIE hasn't looked this good since 1932, and while there are several other respectable DVD release (and a host of bad ones, so beware), the Roan release is the way to go.

As for the film itself, even by 1932 standards THE WHITE ZOMBIE was not a ""screamer"" in the same sense as DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN were; it is instead lyric, at times poetic in nature, disturbing in the same manner of an Edgar Allen Poe poem.  The story is quite simple: Madeline Short (Madge Bellamy) and Neil Parker (John Harron) have come to Hati--and en route have met estate owner Charles Beaumont (Robert Frazer.)  Beaumont falls in love with Madeline; unable to convince her to leave Parker, he goes to zombie master 'Murder' Legendre (Bela Lugosi), who works his evil spell upon her.  But Beaumont soon finds himself at odds with Legendre, and Parker, with the aid of missionary Dr. Bruner (Joseph Cawthorne) has set out to rescue Madeline at all costs.

The cast is quite fine, and many critics consider that this is really Lugosi's best performance of the early 1930s, surpassing his more famous turn in DRACULA.  Indeed, he is a remarkable presence in the film, ugly and sinister and yet at times--it is difficult to describe--one sees the unexpectedly attractiveness of the man in both physical and psychological terms.  It is a memorable performance.  But the big thing about THE WHITE ZOMBIE isn't so much the story or the performances as ""how the thing is done.""

The cinematography is simple, but it has a misty quality, and one is always aware of the texture of black and white; shadows are important in the film, and the overall look is quite unlike anything to come out of Hollywood up to that point--and even today it remains largely unique.  There is an elegance to the way the scenes are staged and photographed that rarely occurs in any film of any era.

Modern viewers without significant interest in films of this period are likely to find THE WHITE ZOMBIE mannered and a bit slow--but if you have an interest in early sound films, and even more so in horror films of the 1930s, THE WHITE ZOMBIE is an essential in your collection.

He transforms his enemies into a nightmarish bodyguard of zombies, and rules mind-numbed slaves by terror. Bela Lugosi makes this film a success. After Dracula, this is perhaps the most effective performance of Bela's horror flicks from the early '30s. The independent production suffers from creaky technical qualities and archaiac dialogue. For its age, however, the film has some impressive visuals of the Haitian night and a spooky Gothic castle perched on a craggy cliff above the thundering breakers. Lugosi does well creating an air of mystery as the voodoo-master, sometimes called Legendre. His distinctive manner of expression, devilish whiskers, and glaring eyes combine into a satanic effect. The rest of the cast is undistinguished. The hero, Neil Parker, is an ineffectual wimp played by an unknown actor. Madeline (Madge Bellamy), the inevitable woman in the story, is the love interest of several men. Why she is the object of so much desire is puzzling, but it moves the plot along. Legendre can't wait to put her under his spell. Mesmerized, she looks like a combination of a flapper and a kewpie doll. Her bobbed hair and pursed little mouth blend with her large eyes into a vacuous trance. The zombie gang, similarly undemonstrative, is nevertheless more exciting. As they gang up to kill Parker, he rather irrelevantly shouts, ""Who are they?"" Bela's reply is one of the best lines in old horror flicks, ""For you, my friend, they are the angels of death!"" This old movie is not for everybody. Regardless, fans of Bela Lugosi and collectors of classic horror flicks need this movie for their collection. ;-)",1001289600,,1701,5.056939501779359

7812276,3,6301394542,"This 77 minute 1932 film was ok, but it was also a disappointment. After starring in 1931 in the famed Dracula film, Bela Lugosi made this film a year later. There is not much to it; therefore, it is relatively short. A lot of the gestures and other acts in this film were already done in the 1931 film. Lugosi even wears the Dracula type clock and he stares at people to control them. Lugosi looks strange in the film; he has a chin beard that is parted in the middle.
The story, in short, is that Lugosi controls a group of zombies who he has do work for him. He happens to see a lovely woman on her way to a wedding and he does all he can to gain control of her. Curiously, the film seems to suggest that he could do so with his hypnotic stare, he uses another method. In fact, unlike Dracula, he hypnotizes no one. He has her killed, and then revives her as a zombie.
