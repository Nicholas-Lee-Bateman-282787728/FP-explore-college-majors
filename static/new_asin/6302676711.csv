494225,5,6302676711,"The first time i saw this movie (""movie"" i.e., cheap but entertaining entertainment, as opposed to ""film"" i.e., cinematic accomplishment) was on invitation from a family of sea-going folks who lived aboard a WW!! tug boat. Thought it was mildly uninteresting and a bit stupid and couldn't understand what they saw in it. Years later an epiphany occurred, i became more enlightened, and since it's become a repeat family favorite of our own, and we enjoy it greatly when we're yearning for some light-hearted entertainment. But if you check Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find it's given a disgraceful score of 24% on the tomato/tamahtoe meter, putting it solidly in the ""Splat!!"" category. It's described as ""eminently missable,"" ""not worth noting,"" an ""attempt at comedy,"" ""unelevated,"" and ""boring."" But it's worth noting that those reviews were written by the eminently unnotable unelevated and boring critics who gave their low and unenlightened opinions of something they obviously felt was beneath their own self-inflated pomposity. Guess they didn't ""get it"" ... but then we wouldn't expect them to, would we? So riddle me this, Morons: If the movie is truly so boringly banal and lacking in merit, why does it resonate so with so very very many, and why is it being sold on every movie site on the web  including Amazon, Google, iTunes, and the Microsoft Store  for the ""let's really gouge the public"" price of $18, when far supposedly ""greater"" films are in the bargain bin at $9.99 and less? Really, why is that Captain Ron?",1511654400,5,1527,5.0078740157480315

They heir a local that seems to know his way around. Soon they find that he knows more than they want to. The father Martin Harvey (Martin Short) starts to feel his control and stature slipping. Captain Ron (Kurt Russell) seems very chummy with the wife Katherine Harvey (Mary Kay Place), corrupting the morals of their son Benjamin Harvey (Benjamin Salisbury), had very lenient with the daughter Caroline Harvey (Meadow Sisto). Captain Ron also seems to be too capable with boats.

Looks like a lot of pitfalls are possible during the yacht retrieval.

Addendum: I had someone critique my one line review and leave me with an impression of dissatisfaction and disappointment with my review and request a better one as per the Amazon suggested guidelines.

494611,3,6302676711,"This is a watchable movie, but I didn't find it to match the hype some people are carrying on about on here.  It does have some fun moments, the warning to stay on the path so you don't encounter gorillas scene, was one of them.  But even that once the punchline is revealed the movie just moves on to them back on the boat. They don't play out the scene for all it could have been.  This suddenly moved on to the future when something happened occurred quite a few times, such as when the dad falls in the water.  It just got annoying after a while.

Captain Ron is a sort of not really appreciating each other family road trip movie that we saw plenty of in the 80's and 90's, but set on a boat that none of the family upon setting out know how to operate. It follows the road trip formula. You've got the typical dad makes the decisions, but they're not always great decisions role, the wife sort of keeps him on track and from doing something really stupid, the teenage girl would rather be with various boys she meets at each port than spend time with her embarrassing family, and the youngest kid is a bit of a social loser who the weird guy who joins them (in this case a captain with an eye-patch who isn't the professional that the father character thought they'd booked), will teach the nerdy kid many things about the real world.  In it's plus, the family actually looks like real people, they haven't cast the most attractive actresses at the time to play the mother and daughter, if this had been made five years later, the studios would have probably insisted someone like Jennifer Anniston be the mother and whatever kids or teen afternoon/Saturday morning TV show program stars to play the two kids.  The boy was probably a bit too TV/movie character nerdy than a regular kid but the actor still does a good job.",1484352000,,1828,4.390532544378698

I'm fine with ""R"" rated comedies, but I do feel sorry for families sometimes trying to find a good clean comedy that they can all watch together and this is one of them. But that aside, this is probably the funniest film that either Short and Russell have ever made. (Well, OK, ""Three Amigos"" is pretty funny, too.)

495293,5,6302676711,"Captain Ron is one of my favorite ridiculous movies from my past.

Kurt Russell plays Captain Ron, who is not your typical captain. His crazy antics & outlook on life add hilarity to the situation the Harvey's are now in.
Martin Short plays Martin Harvey who is an executive from Chicago. He inherited a ""beautiful"" yacht & seen the opportunity to change up their mundane routine & reconnect with their children.

After they set sail, Mr. Harvey is not so sure about the captain's nautical approach. Even though it may appear he is getting the family, mostly Mr. Harvey, in less than desirable situations he is actually showing the family how to be a family at sea & drawn closer.

When you just get used to Captain Ron & his outrageous personality, he is done with his job.

Great comedy for those Friday nights after a long work week. Please note that it is PG13 for a reason. There are several scenes that some may find inappropriate for younger children.",1458086400,3,958,4.617647058823529

Captain Ron is a great family film that will have the kids asking to watch it again and again. If you are anyone you know hasn't been introduced to Captain Ron yet, then it is time that you pick up a copy. A steal at this low price, and deserving of a place in every personal library.

A timeless classic that will probably be worn out long before that gifted copy of Mama Mia ever is. Who am I kidding, you'll probably wear this disc out before you do Guardians of the Galaxy!

496053,4,6302676711,"Before Depps  pirate Jack Sparrow was Kurt Russells Captain Ron. Without his character this movie would be a bust. Only other notable character is the youngster, Ben, played, at that time a young, Benjamin Salisbury. Yet that characters scripted responses to events can be boiled down to and summed up by one word: coooool!

Do not get me wrong. Captain Ron is a movie worth the watch for the sake of watching Kurt Russells character. Characters played by Martin Short and Mary Kay Place come across stilted. Either a lack of chemistry between the two actors or a poorly written scripted-lines for each or a sum of both cases hampers a viewers ability to fully enjoy portrayal of their respective characters.

Notable of the screenplay is one humorous scene, which exchange of dialogue accompanied actions are summarized below:

Ron:  Hey boss, if you're goin back, stay on the path. Theres guerrillas in these woods.

Ben:  Gorillas?  Too cool!

Martin: Ben, honey, there are no gorillas, not here.

Ron:  Oh, yeah, there is, boss.

Martin: Sorry, capt. Ron.  Gorillas are native to equatorial Africa.
Okay?  No gorillas. Not here. No way.

Katherine:  Honey, honey, stay on the path, okay?

Martin:  (Groan)  Now hes got her buying it,  Unbelievable.

Martin walks away, taking the path at first.  Soon after he steps off the path and walks into the jungle. Soon thereafter squawking birds spooks him. He stops and looks around. Gorillas, right,"" he says. Then suddenly a rifle barrel appears on screen, pointed at him. He is stopped in his tracks, wide-eyed, looking startled. At the other end of the rifle is a guerrilla. Behind him stand several other fellow guerrillas.

Later that night of that same day. Martin, speaking to his wife, Katherine, says:
""He couldve said, revolutionaries,  freedom fighters. But no. Go-rillas. No.  He did it on purpose. You can see it in his eyes. Excuse me, his eye!",1436313600,2,1906,4.899686520376176

496161,4,6302676711,"This is yet another family vacation flic, absurd, but not quite to the level of incredulity of some of the others. Kurt Russell manages to pull of an amusing scammer with poor dialogue supplied. Martin Short is appropriately self-absorbed, but not to the ridiculous degree as say, Chevy Chase in Vegas Vacation. Meadow Sisto is much too ""mature"" to be Mary Kay Place's 16 year old daughter. Some viewers will be pleasantly distracted by Meadow. Kurt Russel carries this movie. His acting is appropriate to this kind of scripted movie. Martin Short is more suited to the chaos of Second City tv, where he starred with John Candy and others. There is enough humour here to keep the movie interesting. I found it a little better than most ""vacation"" movies.",1434672000,,754,4.8076923076923075

496168,5,6302676711,"Kurt Russell is funny.  Captain Ron is funny.  Martin Short, heck HE'S funny.  Yes, this is a fun and funny movie.  With Captain Ron's Plisskin-type eyepatch, Captain Ron leads the Harvey (Martin Short) family on a romp across the high seas of the Caribbean.

A family in inner turmoil inherits a boat moored in Ste Pomme de Terre.  The family feels the trip will better help them bond.  Arriving in Ste. Pomme, the broker turns Martin Harvey to Captain Ron to sail them back to Miami.  Since this is a comedy, a direct route is near impossible.  Misadventures follow them everywhere.  They end up in a jungle.  They sail and then end up in Cuba.  Captain Ron is at the helm.  What could POSSIBLY go wrong?

The Harvey family bonds, a friend is made and all's well in the universe.  Or is it?",1433808000,,792,4.440559440559441

Yes, Meadow Sisto  She is not a flat character in this classic movie; she truly understood the personal transition part of the movie.  It is gradual at first, but it is complete after the family enters the raft.  The last time we see the goofy smile and attitude is when she is talking to her ""gorilla"" buddy. Watch her close, Meadow is a different person by the time the family reaches Cuba",1425081600,,551,4.639175257731959

Call it what you want--slapstick road movie set on the high seas; feel-good fish-out-of-water flick; dopey no-brainer--movies like ""Captain Ron"" were never meant for critics, they were meant for fun. The minimal message in this family flick can be summed up by bumper stickers (""Lighten up"") or beer slogans (""Life's too short not to grab all the gusto you can"").

What it's really about is having fun, and Ron gives this repressed family a crash course in partying heartily. It's not a film to be analyzed; it's a flick to be shared. Let's not overrate ""Captain Ron."" It's no cure for cancer; it's a formula flick.

This is Kurt Russell at his comedic best, with Martin Short doing a dead-on performance as his straight man, resulting in an extremely hilarious movie.  The rest of the Harvey family, played by Mary Kay Place, Meadow Sisto, and Benjamin Salisbury, also did excellent jobs, but ultimately, it was Kirk Russell's Captain Ron who stole the show.  His hilarious one-liners ""Dawn comes early on a boat, right Captain?"" ""You're right about that, Boss.  Happens every morning, just about sunup.""  coupled with his facial expressions whenever he gets himself and the Harvey's into one sticky situation or another.

These were great movies during this time, acting was good, they had good plots, movies were made for normal decent folks, etc... This movie, made during this time, has great acting, good plot about an American family who has inherited a yacht and hires Captain Ron to sail the yacht, along with the family, from some Caribbean island to the buyers in Florida. Captain Ron is a hash smoking ""Go to Jamaica Mon"" itinerant. This is a very funny movie although I'm not sure I'd recommend for the whole family, Captain Ron is too horny for the whole family.

497273,5,6302676711,"Something about this movie... So much of it rings true about owning a boat and boating. Has to be one of Kurt Russel's best performances. Martin Short's comedic performance is more understated than most of the movies I've seen him in -- and it's just the right balance. If you're a boater, I think you'll love this movie.

We are sailors and living on a sailboat has its highs,lows, work, fun, adventure, and moments you would like to forget, the movie touches upon it all.  Most recently I saw this one afternoon during which we had been on a rough two day (sailing) passage; it brought a big smile to my tired soul.  Now, if it can make a person feel better and perk up the attitude to sail on, what more could one say?  The cast is great together, I wish I could say thank you to them all.

Due caution however:  funny lines and quirky smiles will be added to your vocabulary.",1379548800,,731,4.105633802816901

497278,5,6302676711,"Kurt Russell does action movies great in my opinion but I think he really shines in comedies, and this one is one of my favorites.  I like the idea the movie brings up, getting an old boat and taking the family out for an adventure, or two, or three.  It starts with a standard uptight family that has gotten busy enough with the day to day everything that they really don't know or respect each other much.  When the dad, Martin Short, agrees to take a boat from point A to point B, he thinks it would a good experience for them all.  Things go downhill off the bat and then you see there is a lot of hill there, though most of the bumps are funny ones.  In the end everyone learns something, everyone that is except for Captain Ron, turns out he knew all he needed too from the funny beginning (keep your eye on the car he pulls up in)  I still like to have this one on in the background when I am doing things around the house.

He reminded me of a Sammy Hagar meets Snake Pliskin :) The casting was spot on with the straight laced family (headed by Martin Short) dealing with the endless antics of a local boat captain that does not navigate, but steers. He pulls in somewhere's and asks directions when lost, parks a boat at full throttle and won his glass eye in a poker game, probably after he learned how important incentives are in rehab. If you have seen it, you know what I'm talking about. Those of you who have not, get this movie asap.

The only reservation I have toward the movie is that it falls back on slapstick a little more frequently than I like, but not enough that it takes away enjoyability.",1348444800,,791,4.570422535211268

497659,5,6302676711,"One of those classic comedies that, at least for me, never gets old.

Probably Martin Short's best movie and one of the few where he plays the lead. And what can you say about Kurt Russell that hasn't been said before - he's an incredible performer. The man can do just about anything and still be believable. And despite his stunningly long career, in my opinion, this is without a doubt his best comedy, even outpacing the funny '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Overboard/dp/6305236569/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Overboard</a>' and those&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter-Riley-Disney-flicks/dp/B00386F0CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter Riley Disney flicks</a>&nbsp;that have long since found a special place my heart.

Short plays Martin Harvey, anonymous cog in a large company and recent recipient of a bequeathed luxury yacht from an uncle not seen in twenty years. His plan: Whisk the family away from the infamous Chicago Winter and sail though the sun-soaked Caribbean isles, then onto Florida to a boat broker who has already agreed to purchase the craft, cash out and head home with a pocketful of money and a wonderful experience. Seems pretty straight-forward.

Unbeknownst to Martin, the busy broker absent-mindedly agreed to the deal without doing a proper records check. However, having finally done so, he unhappily discovers the age of this particular craft. Realizing that he might be throwing good money after bad, surreptitiously amends the original order. Instead of getting one of his best contractors to guide the craft to their facility, he decides to hire the cheapest rent-a-captain in the world - that would be Cap'n Ron. The living embodiment of a one-eyed, beer-guzzling, knucklehead pirate if there ever was one.

The meeting of The Harvey Family and Cap'n Ron is inauspicious to say the least. While the family awaits his arrival - they notice a crazy man who carelessly drives a vintage car off the wharf, dumping it into the ocean. Running toward the yacht, rapid introductions are made as Ron seems *very* eager to start the family's special cruise. And as the boat leaves the dock, in the distant background you can see why he was desperate to get under way - an angry husband with a gun! And this is just the beginning of the movie. X-D

This hasty first encounter sets the stage for the movie as Martin and Ron repeatedly clash with one another - eager dad versus the sly crusty pirate - with hilarious consequences. To this day, on the rare occasion that 'guerilla' is worked into a conversation, I never fail to correct the speaker about gorillas - that they only exist in Equatorial Africa and not in places like Afghanistan.

The results are mixed. But I laugh anyway. :-D

497661,5,6302676711,"The critics are an odd bunch.  They'll collectively dump on a movie like mindless nimrods without even giving it a chance which is the case with ""Captain Ron"".  Leonard Maltin's movie guide gives the film the dreaded BOMB rating.  I avoided seeing the film because of said critics.  My interest in it was piqued when I was surfing Amazon and I saw a preponderance of five star ratings.  After seeing the movie I can honestly say that the unvarnished opinion of the average Joes is more on target than the overfed minions who are paid to mindlessly trash decent flicks.  Kurt Russell, not unlike Jeff Bridges, is one of our more underappreciated actors.  Time and again he has shown his versatility whether it be drama, comedy, action or whatever.  Here he tackles broad comedy and he had me in his introductory scene where he stumbles out of a ""borrowed"" car and proceeds to sink it in the drink by not applying the breaks.  This is not an over-the-top performance but one of subtle touches that tickle the funny bone.  It's that semi-raspy voice that suggests a past that includes some unsaid overindulgence of chemical relaxation.  It's the eyepatch he wears under the sunglasses.  It's the perpetual five o'clock shadow that hints that this guy is on his own private Idaho.  Whatever it is Russell has created an indelible screen character.  The film is a vehicle for Russell and it's success sinks or swims on his performance and consummate pro that Russell is the movie goes swimmingly.  One of the more irrelevant criticisms I've heard is that funnyman Martin Short plays straight man to Russell.  One can assume that Short read the script and as any good comedian knows too many cooks spoil the broth.

497738,4,6302676711,"This movie is worth watching. I think some negative reactions are from disappointed expectations rather than the movie not being actually good. One problem is that it's marketed as a comedy but I don't really see it that way. It's one of those movies that is more amusing than laugh out loud funny. I notice that there are many enthusiastic reviews here.

Obviously, much of the fun is in watching Kurt Russell and Martin Short. Regarding Kurt Russell, the guy is a major star and goes waaaay back to the 60s as already a major star. If you are a fan of his (as 40+ years' worth of people are), you will enjoy watching him cut up in this whacky role. He's a lot of fun and since I've been a fan since 1967's Flubber, I really enjoyed his entire performance.

I'm a big Martin Short fan but so often his roles in movies are restrained, e.g. The Three Amigos. I'm not really sure what he is shooting for in that persona, but if you like him he can come across as charming in whatever he says or does. In this case his character is again restrained, the straight guy, and on the annoying side, plus he's a little bit of a loser. None of that seems like a formula for success and I don't really think the character or performance works all that well but since I like him he comes across as charming for me.

The movie is largely an adventure and it works on that level. A lot of things go wrong and I don't like that type of movie but it doesn't hit that close to home for me because I've never tried to quit my job and take a boat across the world. So the situations seem so outlandish that I can laugh them off without feeling Martin's pain.

Also this movie features Benjamin Salisbury (Brighton from ""The Nanny."") He's a great actor, I really like the way he delivers his lines.

Anyway, as many others here have said, it's pretty good and especially if you're a fan of either or both of the stars, it's worth watching.",1244937600,2,1919,4.2754820936639115

497810,5,6302676711,"CAPTAIN RON is my favorite stupid movie. The story of Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed scoundrel and charter boat skipper (in that order) and the white bread and mayonnaise Harvey family from Chicagoland, this movie is just so absurdly over the top that it's irresistible.

The Harveys have inherited a sea hag that once belonged to Gable and Lombard. The old wooden ketch is gorgeously appointed but dry-rotted and barely seaworthy. Dad Martin Harvey (Martin Short) decides that there's one last sail left in her---to the breaker's yard. He convinces his wife Katherine (Mary Kay Place) and his children Caroline (Meadow Sisto) and Ben (Benjamin Cunningham) to have a nicely planned out ""spontaneous adventure"" taking the old wreck from the mythical Isle of St. Pomme de Terre (""It means St. Potato, honey."" ""No it doesn't."") to Miami.

Since the Harveys can't sail, they hire the disreputable Captain Ron to skipper the boat. Kurt Russell has so much fun playing Captain Ron that he literally eats the storyboards, giving us a portrayal that's half Jimmy Buffett and half Baby Huey spiked with Malibu Rum. His one-liners are all priceless (""Yeah, incentives are important, I learned that in rehab."") and they are constant.

Captain Ron is a consummate sailor, but in the tradition of the true Old Salts of yore, he's totally ragtag, disdaining charts, fuel capacity, weather conditions, international politics, sobriety, and the Harveys own plans as he wanders, Odysseus-like from island to island, drinking, seducing women, enraging husbands, outrunning insurgents, and avoiding arrest on any number of charges, all with the bewildered Harveys in tow.

But as adventure piles on adventure (including a brief internment in Cuba, and a pitched battle with a pirate ship named ""Albondiga"" i.e., ""The Meatball""), Captain Ron shows a daring and competence under pressure that his happy-go-lucky ways belie, thus winning the hearts of the Harveys.

The lemon in this lemonade is the usually sidesplitting Martin Short, who comes across as mostly inept. As the rest of the family starts to take a shine to their bizarre shipmate and he to them, Short never quite manages to have the obligatory male bonding moment with Captain Ron. In Short's defense, he's also stuck with some of the dumbest dialogue ever written for the screen (""You said GOrilla, not GUERRilla...Go, guh, go, guh."" and ""I can't stand Captain Ron, he's eating my brain!"" (?)).

This is Kurt Russell's film and he got 95% of the good lines. Short got stuck with ALL the downers. That's a shame, and it's the only flaw in this otherwise uproarious film. Everybody on the set looks like they're about to lose it utterly, and that's part of the fun of watching. A good time is definitely had by all.

CAPTAIN RON is a cult comedy classic. If you've ever owned a boat or sailed, you will instantly recognize Captain Ron as the squint-eyed grinning undine who lives aboard every boat and in the heart of every true sailor. This is my favorite stupid movie for a reason, and it'll be yours, too. Once you meet CAPTAIN RON you'll never see the sea the same way.",1178668800,21,3114,4.931297709923665

The humor is very similar to The Three Amigos (another of our family favorites); indeed, if you liked the Three Amigos, I think you will very much like Captain Ron, and, if not, you might not like Captain Ron either.

Overall, this is a good family film, with lots of clean humor, one that especially will appeal to families who have had (mis)adventures in the outdoors!",1174435200,,674,4.508196721311475

They plan on spending a family bonding 45-day adventure at sea and end up spending 45 days of hell on the water.  What's great about this film is that it's far from predictable, it's humorous and witty and completely unexpected and will keep you entertained until the very end.  Martin Short and Mary Kay Place are great as the loving parents who are a bit conflicted with their unconventional new captain, and Kurt, as I already mentioned, is superb as Captain Ron.

When Martin Harvey, played by Martin Short, inherits a yacht from an uncle he decides he wants to sail it to Florida to sell. His wife Katherine, played by Mary Kay Place, isn't overly thrilled until she finds out that it was once owned by Clark Gable and may be worth a quarter of a million. They take the kids Benjamin, played by Benjamin Salisbury, and Caroline, played by Meadow Sisto, to pick it up. When they arrive they find that the yacht has been neglected for years and looks a wreck. The company wanting to buy the yacht then decides to change Captains and in walks Captain Ron, played by Kurt Russell, to sail them to Miami. To say he is a seadog with a very unique style of sailing and an unusual outlook on life puts it mildly.

Now along the way they find the yacht has dry rot, fall overboard a couple times, get lost a few times, play hide the salami, almost drown in the shower, run into Guerillas, NOT GORILLAS!, get hijacked by Pirates of the Caribbean, NOT THE DISNEYLAND RIDE!, get tattoos, land in Cuba, and generally have an exceptional adventure. I love both Martin Short and Kurt Russell and this movie is great fun. Capn Ron's and Martin's dialogue is hysterical.

Kurt Russell gives an excellent comedic performance, something that isn't always easy to do.  He plays his role straight, and really lets the antics of Martin Short and the rest of his family play off him.  I love the scene where Russell is sleeping, and the daughter notices that he has his patch on the wrong eye...is Captain Ron for real, or a con man, or worse...?
This film brings a smile to my face whenever I watch it, or even think of a scene, or line, here or there.  And what more do you want a comedy to do?  Buy the film...you'll watch it more than once.

497982,5,6302676711,"For a Wildly hilarious re-watchable comedy, this is your film.  My review is of the movie as this is written pre-DVD. This film has the family of Martain Short, beautiful independent decorator wife and 8 year old son and 16 going on 25 yr old daughter all thrown together on an inherited sailboat they must sail back from the Caribe!  They get the aid of one-eyed Captn Ron, a patch eyed Kurt Russel who seems to have no credentials, but to perturb Martain Short when against logic, he comes through time after time when the chips are down in the most humorous ways possible.  Scene after scene has so much humor you can't pick it all up in one showing. Kurt Russell and Martian Short as Captn Ron and the father/ships owner are perfectly cast.  You will not regret this film and if you are like a lot of folks will end up knowing many of the lines and jokes, the recollection of which will brighten your day with a smile long after the movie.  Has a happy heart warming ending, some suspense, and a generally upbeat tone more movies should have.  It's many sailors' favorite.  I personally loved Steve Martain in The Jerk and to me they both rank one and two in terms of modern comedy movies. Suitable for a whole family and with a gut splitting ending.",1019779200,9,1254,4.426086956521739
497983,5,6302676711,"Great movie. Kurt Russell is Captain Ron who sails an inherited ship from the Caribbeans to Miami. Martin Short is the man who inherited ship. Buy this DVD now, you won't regret it.",1019347200,,181,4.515151515151516
497984,5,6302676711,"Captain Ron has always made me laugh out loud. It's hard not to. I usually don't enjoy Kurt Russell films; however, this movie is probably his best. Martin Short is such a great comedian. He earns some of the biggest laughs. Together, a great vacation movie is made. Captain Ron is very wild and has very clever dialogue. Martin's character inherits a boat, except he has to take the family and sail it from an island to Miami. They have a local sailor, Kurt russell, help them sail it. But, things go wrong, and lots of adventures begin. A funny, clever comedy, with very scenic and beautiful locations. Buy this movie right now, and you won't regret it.",1019260800,,655,4.559322033898305
498035,5,6302676711,"I have to say this movie rules. The execs need to get their act together and make a loaded DVD. If not,""they'll get out of the way, I learned that driving the Saratoga!""
If cult classic movies like The Burbs, Battle Beyond the Stars, She-Devil, and Heathers can make it to DVD, than this one can!",1017705600,,296,4.303571428571429
498036,5,6302676711,"What a great movie.  Finally, a movie that never took itself too serious.  Just a thoroughly enjoyable and humorous 99 minutes.  Kurt Russell gives an under-rated performance and is well supported by Martin Short and Mary Kay Place.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable movie to escape the mundane of everyday life.  As for Touchstone and the DVD, I say ""S*&^ happens.  Cough it up!""",1015113600,2,404,4.782608695652174
498037,5,6302676711,"This movie is amazing. I have watched it more than any other movie I have ever seen.

498038,5,6302676711,"I never got a chance to see this movie on the big screen, which I sorely regret.
Captain Ron is flat out one of the most enjoyable prop-your-feet-on-the-table and enjoy a six pack of beer movies I have ever seen.  I laughed, I cried, I travelled the islands with a rag-tag family, I couldn't believe how fast two hours flew by.
Check this movie out, I guarantee you'll like it.
Please release the DVD, even though I'm breaking my own golden rule and buying a VHS copy.",1010880000,2,468,4.379310344827586
498039,4,6302676711,"so leonard maltin thinks Captain Ron is a waste of time.  I think his review was a waste of time.  I've watched Captain Ron over a dozen times and I still laugh 'till my sides hurt.  Please, oh please, when will it be out on DVD? I recommend this movie to everyone I know. Whatever is gonna happen, it's gonna happen out there.",1010361600,2,327,4.158730158730159
498040,5,6302676711,"...if they don't release this movie on DVD. Captain Ron is one funny movie. It makes you wonder if Leonard Matlin even watched it, his review is so far off base. Perhaps the critics were uncomfortable seeing Kurt Russell and Martin Short play understated comedy, complete with clever dialogue. Sure, there's silliness, slapstick and people overboard, but it all fits in well in this tightly-edited, well-paced comedy. After you see it, you'll understand why anyone would want to be Captain Ron. And own it on DVD.",1010016000,,513,4.976744186046512
498041,5,6302676711,"This is one of Kurt Russell's funniest roles.  This movie was a favorite of my sister and I when it first came out, so of course we bought it and have enjoyed it ever since.  Recently, however, I have been reading critic reviews on movies and I haven't found a movie critic who gave this movie more than 2 stars.  I want to thank all the reviewers on amazon.com for their 5 star ratings.  This movie, although not an oscar caliber movie, is wildly entertaining with a great cast and several memorable moments.  I hope this movie comes out on DVD soon.
If you are thinking of buying or renting this movie and are reading critics reviews of it, don't listen to them.  Listen to the real consumers who write reviews on amazon.  They will tell you that this is a great movie that is worth watching.",1007942400,8,794,4.360544217687075

498044,5,6302676711,"""Captain Ron"" is a classic comedy that has cruisers falling off their bunks every time it is viewed. I last saw ""Captain Ron"" while on ""Millennium Dragon"" at anchor at Green Turtle Cay in the Abacos during Race Week. We spent the rest of the cruise using lines from the movie. ""OK, boss"" and ""Not my boat, boss's boat"" are used frequently. A must see for all boaters but flat landers will also enjoy the movie.",997315200,,410,4.407894736842105
498095,4,6302676711,"This movie is a lot of fun...an escapist comedy of the first order, with fine performances given by the whole cast.  The fact that this is the 40th review submitted for what was originally a summer sleeper confirms that its theme still touches a great many landlubbers (and sailors) out there...I'll join the list of those calling for a DVD release as well as a soundtrack album.  But what I can't understand is how in the hell anyone can make a movie about sailing in the Caribbean and NOT include at least ONE Jimmy Buffett song?  Man, that's just WRONG.",996537600,,556,4.54
498096,3,6302676711,"Down in the Sausalito docks, there are charter boat captains who will swear that Captain Ron is based on this guy they knew in Lahaina or Key West or Newport or wherever.  If you've scrubbed a junky boatdeck or heard a load of martime malarky from some ""seasoned"" salt, then you'll find something to love in Captain Ron.  Caught it again from the middle last night on TV and noticed for the first time the great Spanish rock-n-roll version of ""Who Put the Bomp"" playing on the radio of the old Chevy Ron boosts in Cuba. So grab a blended rum drink and kick off the summer with a fine tale of men...and the sea.",987120000,5,610,4.2956521739130435
498097,3,6302676711,"oh boy.. Captain Ron.. What can I say about Captain Ron.. I have one question for everyone.. has Kurt Russel ever made a good movie? if he has, this isn't one of them.. I mean Escape from new york/L.A we're bad.. but they were so bad that they was funny! but captain ron tries to be funny.. and that where it fails.. miserably. It's the story of a family that inherits a boat.. they go on a trip with a ""wacky"" guide (Russel) and crazy fun family high jinks ensew.. ugh.. that hurt.. This movie is soo freakin' bad.. Kurt Russel is a bad actor.. and that usually adds to the good of a movie, Example: Escape movies.. The only movie he was good in was The Thing.. Now another error they made was making Kurt Russel a wacky guy and Martin Short a serious character.. I mean common! whats wrong with that? I gotta go watch ghoulies or something, must cleanse (sp?) my brain..",982540800,2,872,4.290909090909091
498098,5,6302676711,This movie was great!!!! I laughed so hard at Kurt Russells character.  He is such a versatile actor and is one of my very favorites.  It is amazing that shortly before this movie he made Back Draft.  I thought this comedy had a little everything.  Great scenery and a great supporting cast.  Loved it.,981504000,,302,4.518518518518518

I saw it in theaters! I bought the video! I got the  laserdisc!  Wanted the Soundtrack on CD like crazy but they didn't make  one.  For crying out loud, Touchtone, don't you know a Cult Film when you  see one!  This movie has a following!  Release the Soundtrack!  And how  about a WIDESCREEN DVD WITH EXTRAS!  Yeah, even my laserdisc isn't  presented in the Widescreen (or Letterboxed) format, but I am glad I have  it since for now it's the best copy you can own.  I'm not boasting, I just  love this movie!  The fact that critics hated it makes me sick.  They're  as clueless as Meadow Sisto (that's the cute daughter).  Kurt Russell is  The Man (""I've always been a fast healer... course I believe in  Jesus"").  Martin Short is Hilarious (Pirates of the  Caribbean....""Been to Disneyland one too many times have we, Captain  Ron!
