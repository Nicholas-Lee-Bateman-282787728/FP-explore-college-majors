8035090,4,B0002Z5X3W,Once again Qello's title is misleading. Only the first half of this video features Brubeck but it is the Brubeck Quartet at it's early best. There is an interesting interview with Ralph Gleason in which Brubeck discusses what he thinks should be the future of jazz. Paul Desmond is at the peak of his playing career here and it's well worth a listen to.,1503273600,,353,4.53125
8035091,5,B0002Z5X3W,"The time is near sunset at the closing of the 1979 Newport Jazz Festival when The Dave Brubeck Quartet takes the stage to repeated standing ovations. It was only 8 years previous on July 3, 1971 that Dave and co. barely squeezed in a 40 minute set before rioting by the crowd closed down the festival. Maybe 7 minutes of Take 5 was not enough, so in 1979 Dave made sure to stretch it to more than 8 minutes. It's Hard to figure why no one ever put out a CD of this music. Brother Can You Spare A Dime, Tritonis, Big Bad Basie, Take 5 and a couple more all dynamite. It is really difficult to track down information on this 1979 festival. I just received a brand new copy, to replace my old grainy one donated to the local library. They no longer accept VHS tapes, but when they saw what it was they took it. . .heh heh. Jerry Bergonzi on sax, Brubeck son Chris on bass and trombone, and Randy Jones on drums. Jerry puts an edge on Take 5 -- outstanding! Chris Brubeck's trombone on Big Bad Basie is worth the price of admission by itself!",1175472000,2,1038,4.169154228855722
