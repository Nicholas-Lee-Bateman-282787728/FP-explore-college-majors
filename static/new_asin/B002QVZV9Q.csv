3967819,5,B002QVZV9Q,"The movie ""Set Apart"" was a wonderful and insightful journey of teenagers navigating the waters of adulthood. There are many pressures that are present for teens today that no other generation in America has faced. They have many different decisions to make and they must be made definitively and oftentimes quickly. A wrong decision can negatively impact the remainder of their lives. Enter a real live group that extends a ""life line"" to young people at risk. They offer a haven, a retreat, to sort out some of the world's demands while in a safe environment. It is a story of inspiration and defeat of negativity...a rise of righteousness that must be applauded.",1319414400,14,665,4.893805309734513
3967820,5,B002QVZV9Q,"This DVD was great! My family and I enjoyed it very much, and my children have learned that ""With GOD, all things are possible"". I recommend this movie to all families out there. GOD bless each one of you that reads this:)",1270684800,20,222,4.309523809523809
3967821,5,B002QVZV9Q,Awesome! Thanks! The movie is great and awesome acting!!! Good story!!! Thanks so very much! Will recommend to other friends!!,1395964800,,126,5.35
3967822,5,B002QVZV9Q,"There is so much truth in the story line of this film, I wonder why we have so few programs in this country that implement the strategies used in this movie.  I've worked with the homeless and those with addictions for several years and the majority of them have some horrendous stories from growing up (not all, but many).  This is a Christian based film that shows how to walk out our faith and let God do the transformation.

I purchased this film after I bought it.  This is a great movie for the whole family and would be great for a youth group to watch.  I'm sure some interesting discussions would be opened up.",1395273600,3,619,4.3478260869565215
3967823,5,B002QVZV9Q,"We watched this last night.  Both my husband and i LOVED this movie.
This is not an IN YOUR FACE religious movie.  It is more about ""living it everyday"" kind of thing.  The acting by everyone is not the best but the story line is WONDERFUL and UPLIFTING and GIVE YOU HOPE for the future.
Kind of a western type -slightly yet kind of country too.  LOVED the music also.
I HIGHLY recommend this film.",1391990400,4,398,4.266666666666667
3967824,5,B002QVZV9Q,Great message. There is always someone out there who cares and can help make a difference. Especially for the kids,1388966400,,114,4.75
3967825,5,B002QVZV9Q,"Set Apart is the story of how four troubled youths from the inner city get the chance to work on a ranch for the summer. The film Stars Randy and Heidi Gunn as themselves and is based on a true story. This film is very uplifting and wholesome, and it is about how Randy and Heidi were trying to make a difference in these youths lives, and by extension how we can make a difference too.

If you are looking for a movie with nonstop action, violence, and salty language, this is not it. Also, if you are looking for top-of-the-line acting and a quick pace, this movie is not it either. However, the story has an ability to resonate deeply with the viewer, and though the pace is a bit slow (especially at the beginning), the film still comes of as quite entertaining.

Clean, wholesome, satisfying, funny. A movie that inspires me to want to help others and yet, done in a clean, fun, suspenseful way.",1376006400,7,900,4.383233532934132
3967826,5,B002QVZV9Q,This movie is a great movie for that rebellous friend and/or misguided person in your life.  It teaches moral values of which we all need especially in similar circumstances.  Recommended for everyone!!,1369180800,,202,5.28125

8377943,3,B002QVZV9Q,"This movie had so-so acting. The story is based on an actual ministry and I think that is wonderful, but the acting made it hard at times to concentrate on the story line. I would like to see the movie have a stronger stand on using God's word in the script, it seemed as though they were trying to be Christian without making a strong committed stand to God's word. Thank you, Teresa.",1446508800,,385,4.287671232876712
