8209474,5,B000GTLANQ,"As a long time Trash Can Sinatras fan I was thrilled when I heard that this was going to be released. I was at the March 16, 2004 show and it was a night I'll not soon forget. True, the production value of this DVD may not be on par with Pink Floyd (mercifully), but simple and direct doesn't necessarily mean poor. In a word, it's all gloriously intimate. The band puts plenty of energy into these live performances and keeps them interesting and engaging. If you want antics or gimmicks, go watch the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Further, I think the audio sounds great, in fact I transferred the soundtrack to CD-R so I could listen to it in the car, on my iPod, etc. The sets are very balanced, lots of new stuff peppered with enough old favorites to keep a smile on your face.

If you're a fan of Trashcan Sinatras or music of that ilk, you won't regret buying this DVD! And if you're looking to discover some fantastic new music, this is a fine place to start.",1241481600,,1714,4.2253086419753085
8209475,3,B000GTLANQ,"First, of course, comes the disclaimer:  from what I know of the Trashcans' history, they haven't made a boatload of $$ in their career.  In fact, prior to the release of ""Weightlifting"" & this corresponding tour, they were emerging from whatever bankruptcy means for obscure bands from Scotland.
Therefore, it stands to reason that this DVD would be a low-budget affair; unfortunately it shows it a little too well, IMHO.  If you're reading this, you're probably a fan, so you know how important sound quality is to their quiet & subtle music.
That importance is starkly demonstrated by the quality differences between the ""bonus"" cuts recorded in the KCRW studios & the concert itself.  For all it's rock 'n' roll cachet, the Troubadour seems to kind of swallow the Trashcans' music rather than enhancing it.  And, maybe they were nervous, but they certainly aren't a very exciting group visually.  That, of course, is secondary, & in the interest of full disclosure, I've only watched it once.
But, in the last few years, I've also become a Porcupine Tree fan, & where I can't seem to keep their concert DVD out of my player, I'm not in a big hurry to watch the Trashcans again.  And, if they do tour the US this spring, as is rumored, which venue they play in my area will now help determine if I go see them.
It took me awhile to really ""get"" the Trashcans (I got ""I've Seen Everything"" first), so I will give them the benefit of the doubt & make sure to watch this several times soon.  If I feel differently, I will rewrite this, but for now this is my reaction.",1236729600,,1568,4.555160142348755
