528650,3,6302990033,"SEIZE THE DAY could have been written and produced for movie-going audiences yesterday. I mean, literally, like yesterday of this week!

Swap out the 1950's cars and style of  clothing, and this is a unreal story of a good man who has become, sadly, obsolete both in his income generating ability and in the positive reforming his personal life. The once lucrative big money deals, the good times, the fat paychecks, the loving wife and kids, the big house with payments due every month, and all the respect and admiration that all of those things brings is long gone in Robin Willams' portrayal of Wilky Adler.

Williams' character struggles to rebuild his life after a painful divorce and a huge downturn in his industry as a territorial traveling salesman. Williams' Wilky Adler politely struggles to defy going into his father's lucrative medical practice and wants to be his own man and to successfully make his own way in life. An admirable quality. However, the emotional roadblocks and personal setbacks, within the plot of this film, mar his way forward.

You know, sitting through this film is almost like watching a positive salmon swim desperately upstream against the harsh currents of  cold and unforgiving waters and resentfully hard rocks. I kept looking ahead for the eventual hungry grizzly bear that's sure to come!..Lol...Lol...

Again, a lot of what's going on this film spotlights a lot of the things that we can totally relate to now: a horrible and sluggish economy, a super-high divorce rate, legions of ungrateful children, sheer joblessness, and the forced downsizing both of lifestyles and career choices.

For my filming tastes, SEIZE THE DAY, is an interesting look at the very funny Robin William trying his acting chops on a somewhat more dramatic role. He does okay with what's given here. Truthfully though?...After seeing it once, I don't think that 'll be having second helpings.

Besides, I'm way too busy filling out job applications for $9.00 an hour jobs that are too far away....",1387670400,3,2020,4.991071428571429
528651,3,6302990033,The acting was wonderful and that is the only reason I am not giving it two stars.  But Arthur Miller has done this story before and did it better.,1373414400,,147,4.068965517241379
528652,3,6302990033,"The acting is great.  The story, by Saul Bellow, is not for one suffering
from depression.  It is heavy!  Good movie/book for a discussion group.
The vocal quality is poor.  Very worthwhile.

528653,5,6302990033,"An interesting film adapted from Saul Bellow, the famous Nobel Prize winner. Here the character, a middle-age Jewish man, is accumulating all kinds of difficulties: he is fired, he is separated from his wife who hassles him for money, he is rejected financially and emotionally by his own father, he is fooled by a fake finance wizard who practically robs him of his money, and I should say etc and so on. The character is perfectly hysterical in an absolutely paranoid direction and we can see him going down little by little and it all ends up on a total dead end blind alley impasse. In other words a perfect loser in the Jewish culture who ends up crying on his own fate in the funeral of some other guy he does not know at all among people who don't know him nor he them. That is pure Saul Bellow who dedicated his whole writing career to such losers and total misfits in the world of making money not only to survive, not even to live, but to exist. In other words he is self immolating himself at the social stake of financial failure. Brilliant.

528654,5,6302990033,"I know it sounds sacreligious, but I've never thought Robin Williams was funny and the harder he tries to be funny the more unfunny I find him.  I was really impressed therefore, the first time I saw him in a dramatic performance a few years ago and it was Seize the Day.  I had no idea that he had such talent.  He communicates everything that there is to be felt in the story by the strength of his performance.",1168473600,19,413,4.2025316455696204
528655,5,6302990033,"Very faithful adaptation of Saul Bellow's novel, with Robin Williams in the lead role as Tommy Wilhelm, a 40-year-old man down and out on his luck and howling at the world because of it. Williams lets out all the stops and creates a harrowing and harried character who loses all hope. A powerful picture.",1110585600,6,304,4.648148148148148
528656,5,6302990033,"Willy is pitiful! A middle-age man and he still can't get his act together. Earlier in his life he rebels against his parents wishes and attempts to make his own way but can never seem to get it together. His life is what....?
  Robin Williams gives us an excellent portrait of a man who rebels for the right reasons but is missing that mysterious ""something"" which can give his life meaning. Attempting to fill the void in his life is the challenge he faces throughout the film. You feel sorry and at the same time find yourself disgusted with the character who never seems to grows up.
  Saul Bellow's work has been easily adapted to the screen with fine actors who will keep you going. His commentary about life, the myth of hard work and fulfilling dreams make you question your own life. Is it worth being in the rat race? Watch this movie and you will see.",974592000,16,862,4.436708860759493
528657,4,6302990033,"""DEAD POET SOCIETY""  I like this movie, because I was moved by it. Perhaps, this movie tells us that you don't have to obey your parents and try to be honest to yourself and live anything you like!! In this film, all children obey their parents. The school the children go to is very strict. One day a teacher named Mr. Keating came to school. Mr Keating is a free-thinker. Because of his appearence,children's thinking is changing day by day.  In this film, my favorite charactor is Mr Keating,because he always smiling and I like his way of thinking.  The most impressive scene for me is when Mr. Keating leaves the school and students stand up on their desks and say, ""Oh, Chaptain my chaptain"" I couldn't control myself and moved into tears.
 At last, I think this film is worth seeing very much , please rent this film and watch it!!",973987200,3,838,4.493421052631579
528658,4,6302990033,"This film is one of Robin Williams' best performances.  Perfect as Saul Bellow's protagonist, Williams plays Wilky Adler, a man approaching an  inevitable mid-life crisis.  Wilky is pathetic and pitiable, an everyman  who could never get his life in order.  Devoid of redemption, this film is  familiar and painful, with stellar acting from Williams, Joseph Wiseman  (Dr. Adler), and Jerry Stiller (Dr. Tamkin).",966816000,25,411,5.428571428571429

528757,4,6302990033,This film is a great look into the early work of Robin Williams. It portrays the psyche of a man who has lost everything and is seeking affection and acceptance. The lack of affection from his father has shaped a man who feels responsible for everyone happiness but his own. Yet when he needs help he finds nothing but scorn and criticism. Knowing Williams life-long struggle with depression puts different lenses on this film as at times you feel that Robin is not acting but simply being exposed.,1474588800,2,498,4.670454545454546

529167,3,6302990033,"Seize the Day the Fielder Cook directed film based upon Saul Bellows mid-period novella, is a fraught vehicle, a roller-coaster ride of human emotions, with Tommy Wilhelm( Robin Williams) at the mercy of his father Dr Adler, who despises his lack of success, shortage of money, need for love, his helplessness; and his ex wife who is bleeding him dry, preventing him from seeing his kids. He is mostly at the mercy of a friend,conman, Dr Tampkin (Jerry Stiller), a junk dealer, who gives him therapy to deal with the stresses life throws at him, but also fraudulently enlists him to invest in profitless commodities..He tells him to seize the day. Hes disappointed his girlfriend ,lost his sanity. Williams gives a powerhouse of a performance, sweaty, frenzied, manic, angry, where his comic timing fuels the lability of his emotional intensity, with his face switching from despair to hilarity in a moment and his body in perpetual motion. He screams,he shouts,he cries as if on a rack. A Robin Williams film for people who don't really like Robin Williams, this edgy adaptation of Saul Bellow's novel sees the star for once submerging his overpowering comic persona inside the demands of the role - and the result is certainly the least mannered, arguably the most effective performance of his screen career to date. The film is supported by many well known actor cameos.

This is made-for-TV feature which uses a broad brush stroke treatment set in the success-driven 50s, where failure was not an option and heartlessness is everywhere. His father a successful doctor is disappointed his son didn't follow in his footsteps. Back in New York,the power group are crusty old Jewish men who play cards and hang out at the steam baths,where there are evocative scenes. People seem to live out of hotels. The director has a literal,one-note,telling-of the-story approach,all of it unravelling in a downward spiral without let, until the scene at the end in a funeral parlour where his emotions pour out for a complete stranger. Uncompromising. Only watch for the revelation of William's straight acting, or if you liked the book so much you want to see the filmed version. Look out for Bellow as ' man in hall'.",1434499200,,2209,4.938172043010753

529356,5,6302990033,"I've been systematically working through Robin Williams's filmography, and this gem is a must-see. He was born to play the sensitive, doomed Tommy Wilhelm, who seems destined to be crushed by the people he loves most at every turn. Tommy's mountain of tics and bursts of desperate insanity provide the most obvious opportunity for Williams to show his stuff, but make no mistake, this is a well-rounded performance. The mark of a great actor is that he doesn't use his material as an excuse to dazzle you with his talent. Rather, he immerses himself in it and draws you into the soul of the character he's created. In Seize the Day, Robin Williams didn't just blow me away with Robin Williams, he blew me away with Saul Bellow. The story is the star here, and what a devastating story it is.",1410393600,14,791,4.617021276595745
529387,4,6302990033,"Even among Robin Williams' sizable filmography, this was a title that I hadn't heard of until a few days ago. Unlike most of his films, this one was made for TV, although he still gives it his all in what could be one of his most personal performances (after the fact).

 Based on a novel by Saul Bellow, Williams plays Tommy Wilhelm, a recently out-of-work furniture salesman who moves to New York in hopes that he will become successful. Further complicating his problems is a wife (separated, not divorced) and two kids that he has to support, and a hard father that he desperately wants to connect with. Robin Williams fires on full cylinders here, turning in a performance filled with anger, pain, desperation, and sadness. All he wants is to make enough to live, but he is beset at every turn with dismissal, judgment and even deception. Deception comes in the form of Mr. Tamkin (Jerry Stiller), a so-called ""doctor"" who gets Tommy into the world of stock trading. I could go on about the plot, but that's really more than enough to know going in.

 Instead of a straightforward plot, this film more than anything serves as an acting showcase for Williams dramatic acting talents. He imbues his character with such emotional fragility, that it tugs on the heartstrings when his world finally comes to pieces. Other than Williams, Stiller also gives a great performance as a fair weather friend and scam artist. The actor who plays Williams' father is also quite good. In general, the cast acts out the story well, with the exception of Williams' mistress Olive, who seemed rather flimsy and bland.

 Being that this was made for TV, the cinematography and camerawork isn't too spectacular, but it is serviceable. The editing was also a little jarring in places, and certain scenes could have used better transitions. Still, given the age and source (VOD, but probably sourced from a VHS), it looked fine. Overall, I would consider this an underrated gem, mostly because I don't think a lot of people are familiar with it. Still, despite Williams' best efforts, the story wasn't too emotionally involving for me. I always felt like I was on the periphery, watching some terrific acting to be sure, but never quite investing in the story like I would have hoped. Maybe that's because everything is hopelessly stacked against the protagonist, who knows? But for those who haven't seen it yet and are in the mood for something by Robin Williams, it's definitely worth a rental.",1410134400,9,2480,4.823529411764706

529396,4,6302990033,"This is a brutal adaptation of a brutal novel by Saul Bellow, about the hapless Wilky Adler (his alternative identity being Tommy Wilhelm, a dream shattered by reality years ago). Wilky is on the verge of something: Whether it's an epiphany, a breakdown, or outright suicide is difficult to say. He is the Biblical Job of the American Dream, the terrifying truth of failure that the Arnold Schwarzeneggers and Donald Trumps of the world would rather see swept under a rug. Three figures join to become the three-headed hydra that bedevils poor Wilky:

The first is his father, Dr. Adler. Disgusted by his son's sloppy habits and poor financial state, Adler is unaware that his own spiritual bankruptcy has left him a hateful, cadaverous creature with only the near-dead to keep him company and call him ""friend""; a Scrooge without the intervention of three ghosts.

The second is Dr. Tamkin, a con man with a heart blacker than sin, and much like the worst men of history, he ""knows how to talk"". Tamkin ensnares Wilky early on; he is an evil, fox-like man, dropping just enough golden nuggets in his slippery speech to spur Wilky along, until he finally leaves the man for dead. Tamkin is a sociopath, but he is no less sociopathic than the rest of the population of New York City, where Wilky resides.

And the last is Margaret, Wilky's wife. Rarely seen but always felt, Margaret is the misogynist's worst fears of womanhood made flesh; a narcissistic harpy who takes and takes and takes, exploiting simple human emotions as guilt and conscience to her own advantage. Margaret is a monster in every sense of the word, and far more terrifying than Grendel's mother of ancient myth, becase she's all too real.

Wilky himself is a broken human being with little left to live for. He is a soulful man, in a time and place where having a soul simply isn't fashionable. So, he is judged and swept aside to join the rest of the human flotsam that comprises the nation's ""losers"".

What ultimately happened to Wilky? Did his final roar of laughter during the last sixty seconds of the film indicate rebirth, or madness? Wilky's only salvation may be with Olive, a Roman Catholic who provides the only presence of God in an otherwise godless film, but she can only do so much for someone as ruined as Wilky. In a country where ""In God we trust"" has long been superseded by ""look out for number one"", Wilky's only option may be the peace of death.

His ""friends"" reject him, as does the cold-hearted father whom he loves.  He is the victim of a con man.  At the end of the movie, he is sobbing uncontrollably.  The whole story is an illustration of the title of an old blues song, ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out.""  This movie will be too depressing for some viewers.

7833146,5,6302990033,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"" or straight dramas.  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to Robin's character so much.  Anyone who's had to deal with the pressures and expectations of an overly demanding Dad/family, especially well into their adult years, should be able to relate.  A lot of people love Robin's more manic, mainstream roles, but most times those just tire me out lol  His more ""human"", often darker work tends to be what I gravitate toward.  And this is definitely one of his most human and underrated performances.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494547200,,1555,4.714814814814815
