8362248,5,B000CPJEFU,"This isn't kid stuff...these are seriously twisted people and when they bleed from their hearts, it becomes a very hard movie to ignore.  Some of the acting in this movie is so incredible you wonder why it is still such a secret treasure of discovery.

I rented it, but then I really didn't want to send it back so I came here and bought a copy.  I've watched it five times now and it blows me away even more each time.",1143936000,,419,4.148148148148148
