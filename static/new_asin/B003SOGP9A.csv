8404527,1,B003SOGP9A,"The DVD from Derek's Discount is pitiful. expensive and a rep for them said I should have had to pay more than was recorded but they will honor the price this time. I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. It was chopped up. Didn't offer any teaching without bringing confusion. I'm very unsatisfied with this one product. I feel misused at the least. If it had been what they said it was. It would have been pricey but useful. I was taken advantage of by this provider. Respectfully, Ronnie Marsh",1447545600,,500,4.566666666666666
