748750,5,6303980309,"This is a brilliant adaptation of Waugh's sharply satirical novel ""A Handful of Dust"" (also worth reading). The pace is beautiful and I thought the casting was perfect. Kristin Scott Thomas is remote and succinct as Lady Brenda, James Wilby as her husband Tony is restrained panic. Giving Rupert Graves the part of near-sociopathic Mr Beaver was a stroke of genius. He is good-looking without being overly unctuous.
The story is set in England of the 1930's. Tony and Lady Brenda, and upper class couple who live mostly in the country,  have been married for seven years when Tony invites a man from his club to come and stay, Mr Beaver. Brenda gets an odd hankering for their guest, even though Mr Beaver proves himself to have feet of clay over and over again - but then so does she. There is a slow decline in Tony and Brenda's relationship, the deterioration filtering through layers of genteel gossip and impeccably good manners. The ending has a marvellous twist to it also. The script retains some of the sharpness of the Waughs novel, and much of the humour.",978134400,41,1066,4.7005347593582885
748751,4,6303980309,"Evelyn Waugh's novel gets more than your average ""period piece"" treatment here. Art direction is a plus, as are costumes, set design, and score. But there's also a consistent (and coherent)  effort to convey the  sense of inevitability present in the novel. Thanks to superb acting  (particularly by James Wilby and Kristin Scott-Thomas) that effort pays  off. You feel the main cahracters spiralling down - but there seems to be  no way to guess their end. Rupert Graves is also very good, but Judi Dench  and Alec Guiness in comparatively smaller roles give us performances that  are as luminous as ever. Intriguing score. Why not 5 stars? Tempo. Pace. A  few minuts less wouldn't hurt it - they're not essential to plot or  characterization, they just let the camera take in the beautiful sets  languidly...  Maybe for some people that would be deserving of a 5th star.  Maybe. I still think it's a beautiful music, the acting is superior and  it's something of an unknown gem.",945648000,55,980,4.831325301204819

748880,2,6303980309,"Waugh's Handful of Dust is a terrific and dark novel, with funny sharp dialogue.  For reasons known best to the writers of this movie, precious little of this amazing dialogue appears in the film.  The direction makes the film sappy where the story is not, and loses all of the black comedy until the ending where, mercifully, the great Alec Guinness appears.",1352592000,2,359,4.774193548387097
748881,3,6303980309,"At the end of the day, I'm not sure how to feel about `A Handful of Dust'.  Part of me wants to say that it was a good film and the other part of me recognizes that the main things I really love about this film are the parts of the film I can quote in a mocking manner.  It is far from a polished and logical work, but I'm dying to read the novel it is adapted from just to see if the film captured the spirit or if the campy deliciousness of some random moments was completely misapplied.

I've never wished to gif a single film as much as I have this one (google it if you don't know what I mean).

The film follows a relationship that buds between a wealthy young married woman and a charming young man with big ambitions.  Brenda Last resents her husband because he is boring and consumed by his house and his small life and she becomes infatuated with John Beaver, a penniless man of sorts who thrives to take Brenda out on the town, on her own dime.  As their affair grows questionable happenings take place, followed by tragedy and then a bizarre turn of events when Brenda asks for a divorce and her somewhat reclusive husband takes to a jungle expedition.  It is all very strange and the ending is disturbing and oddly unsettling and yet in a way it all works.

And maybe that's because I enjoyed laughing at it.

It literally took me twenty minutes to tune my ear to their accents.  I do watch British films all the time and yet the sound quality of this film is poor (if you have an accent you should not be allowed to talk while leaving a room) and so I felt myself straining to understand what was going on and missing large segments of conversations in the film's beginning.  The tonal quality of the film is debatable, especially when the tragedy strikes and both Tony and Brenda Last react in such strange and nonsensical ways.  It just wasn't believable at all.

Still, watching Anjelica Huston strut around like Rosy O'Donnell and strike a pose while having her furs removed was priceless, and I will forever quote Alec Guinness (""yes, you will read to me"") to uproarious laughter in my home.  For these reasons, I will love this film all my days.

Oh, and it was very pretty.",1348444800,,2194,4.330073349633252
748882,4,6303980309,"As other reviewers have noted, the acting is first-rate across all roles both major and minor. There's a dreadful fascination in watching a woman utterly destroy the husband who has given her everything - wealth, leisure, kindness, love - without ever once acknowledging what she is doing. This is a superb character study, based on Evelyn Waugh's wife, and full of accurate details and acute psychological observation. This is a very uncomfortable movie because it deals so exactly with its theme: the thoughtless destruction of a man's entire life by the very person who owed everything to him. Not to be missed, but not to be watched easily.",1313625600,4,644,4.972222222222222
748883,3,6303980309,"Kristin Scott-Thomas heads the truly fine cast in this made-for- TV film of the novel of the same name.  I have never seen Ms. Scott-Thomas give a performance that is less than brilliant and in this, her fine intelligence is matched by her great beauty. She is reason enough to sit through two hours of this dreadful story.

The other reason is the lush photography, so typical of British productions.  And yes, I'm a sucker for the splendid old houses, and affluent lifestyle of the aristocracy in the period between the two World Wars.

The story is interesting  up to a point. I kept wondering when the good husband was going to wake up and realize that his beloved wife was playing him like a Stradivarius.  Actually Brenda seemed much too intelligent to throw away her beautiful life for the pretty-boy Beaver.  Perhaps casting Scott-Thomas was a mistake for as talented as she is, she was not convincing as someone that stupid and vapid.

The story takes a very strange turn when the poor husband, who has lost not only his son but his wife, makes a snap decision to accompany a very dubious looking man on a trip to the Amazon.

I kept wondering how the author would tie these disparate elements together.  Well, he didn't and that's the problem with this plot.  I haven't read the novel so perhaps it was more plausible there.  I read somewhere that the first part of the story is based on his own marriage and divorce and he simply didn't know how to end it.  It doesn't work at all and to say that it is disappointing is a huge understatement.

I notived that several of the reviews mentioned the humour of the film.  Perhaps there was some dark humour in the novel but I failed to see any of it in the film.

Still, the cast is stellar---where else do you find Judi Dench, Anjelica Huston, Kristen Scott-Thomas and Alec Guiness in one film? For that and the lush settings, I give the film three stars.",1265241600,,1912,4.498550724637681
748884,1,6303980309,"It takes a lot to drive me to write a review, but this film has just wasted two hours of mine and my husband's time, and therefore I feel strongly about it.  We were attracted to the film because of the fantastic cast, and they did act beautifully.  However, this was a long drawn out story with a beginning and a middle, but no end.  It was painfully slow, and with hindsight, we should have given up after the first long painful hour, but we persevered in the hope it would improve.  None of the characters were likeable, and therefore it was difficult to care what happened to them.... and given that the scriptwriter couldn't be bothered to create an end for the film, I can only assume he felt similarly.",1263600000,7,709,4.3893129770992365
748885,3,6303980309,"The whole tone of this film is one of utter hopelessness - the characthers appear lost - there is absolutely no redemption to speak of. Its so long since I read the book, I cannot tell whether the film is faithful to the book. I would compare the film to the film of the ""The Painted Veil"", where there is redemption, the adultress wife grows and finds her redemption in the new fire of her love for her husband and this is echoed by his reciprocal forgiveness. So, even though that film ended ostensibly on a low note (the death of the husband), the redemption of the wife meant that hope had been enkindled. There is nothing like that here - it ends grimly as it begun grimly. Now the actng is fine and in terms of cinematopgraphy it is enjoyable but gloom is gloom.",1262822400,2,768,4.303448275862069
748886,5,6303980309,"A Handful of Dust is arguably Evelyn Waughs finest novel, striking a perfect balance between dark humour and aching tragedy without indulging in the baroque excesses that make Brideshead so tempting and yet so flawed. In fact, HoD shares some of its themes with Brideshead Revisited, especially the threat posed to traditional aristocratic country life by a vapid modern lifestyle, and the destruction of the great English country house. But while at the end of Brideshead Charles Ryder has found redemption and is looking `unusually cheerful', nobody is smiling at the end of HoD - with the possible exception of the gruesome Mr. Todd, a lover of Dickens who is himself a Dickensian character as well as one of the most viciously evil personages to emerge from 20th century literature.

This quietly stylish production does full justice to the novel (but please do not use it as a substitute, you'll rob yourself of a wonderful read). James Wilby is perfect as the almost childishly nave Tony Last, clinging to outdated codes of chivalry with such determination that he volunteers to take the role of guilty party in his divorce, even though it is his wife who is cheating on him. He seems to be looking at the modern world in a state of constant, bewildered surprise. But just when the callous Brenda thinks she's getting it all, it turns out that Tony is not quite the cuckold everybody took him for. Unfortunately, however, his plan of chasing the vision of a gothic dream city in the Brazilian jungle backfires in a way almost too cruel to bare.

The film has everything spot on. Huge, quaint and ugly Carlton Towers is a perfect choice for Hetton Hall; you can see why Tony loves it, yet understand why Brenda hates it. The art deco detail of the London scenes is delightful. And the jungle scenes add an exciting touch of adventure. But given Waughs razor-sharp texts, it is the characters that carry the movie, and all the actors make the most of them. Judy Dench is hilarious as the shamelessly exploitative Mrs. Beaver, Rupert Graves equally perfect as her disgusting leech of a son. Kristin Scott Thomas is Brenda to a tee, all elegance and style and bored, blind egotism. Young Jackson Kyle deserves special mention; he is an utterly endearing John Andrew which makes his eventual fate even more heart-wrenching than it already is in the novel. Anjelica Huston and Stephen Fry make small but significant appearances, the former as a likeable Mrs. Rattery, the latter as Brenda's caddish brother Reggy. And to top off this list of luxury casting we get Alec Guinness as the sly, Amazonian psychopath.

HoD never really got the attention it deserved; yet it is infinitely better than the much-hyped yet absolutely awful recent remake of Brideshead Revisited. Indeed, given the relative failure of Stephen Fry's Bright Young Things (i.e., Vile Bodies), HoD is still the only successful Waugh movie around (with the possible exception of the 1986 Scoop, which I haven't seen). Don't miss it.",1257724800,3,2999,4.876470588235295
748957,1,6303980309,"Let me make this easy for you. Tony & Brenda are married to each other, but split up because Brenda is unfaithful. Tony goes to Brazil on what he thinks is an adventure, and ends up trapped there. Everyone back in the UK is falsely led to think he is dead by a man who keeps Tony a virtual prisoner so that he will read Charles Dickens books to him. A funeral is held for Tony back home, who is actually still alive. And the movie ends. Wow, did I ever get a lot out of that.

You might ask, how can such a negative review be valid when so many other reviews for this movie are so positive? Well, I have been reading movie reviews on this site for some time, and I have concluded that people write reviews for movies that have attracted them for some reason. They tend not to bother with movies that they have reason to believe they would not like. If they saw and wrote reviews for such movies, there would be a lot more negative reviews. This is somewhat similar to auto websites in which folks write reviews on their new cars. Even the worst dogs get great reviews. The reviewers wouldn't have bought the cars if they didn't like them.

So, what is so bad about a movie in which everything goes downhill and the only character I had some liking for ends up trapped and is thought to be dead? Well, I guess I can live with unhappy endings, but I generally still need to get some kind of a positive message. In this case, the message seems to be that a marriage is worth saving. Not enough of a message to make up for the time I wasted on this movie.

By the way, this is the first movie review I have written. I figured something this bad deserves a response.",1250121600,10,1661,4.168224299065421
748958,4,6303980309,"The story opens in 1932, in the magnificent country home of Tony and Brenda Last (James Wilby, Kristin Scott Thomas).  Tony loves puttering around the old manor, while Brenda longs for the party life in London.  Out of sheer boredom, she begins an affair with a social-climbing mama's boy (Rupert Graves).

As the title indicates, this is a grim story, the first part being a rather typical domestic drama focusing on the stuffy, idle rich.  No one plays the snobby aristocrat better than Thomas, and she is so wonderfully convincing, you'll hate her.  Wilby is well-cast as the dull but loyal lord of the manor who dotes on his young son.  Graves is handsome and suitably innocuous.  This section of the film exaggerates the stiff-upper-lip, passionless lives of the upper classes in contrast to the end, which takes us halfway around the world to a primitive land.  This part was very creepy and left me cringing.

I love period pieces set in posh locations, so I really enjoyed this movie.  It's beautifully photographed at the exquisite Carlton Towers estate.  The acting is excellent and the odd turn at the end may leave one a bit depressed but still satisfied.  Recommended.",1245110400,3,1181,4.85
748959,5,6303980309,"Brenda and Tony Last live in a quirky English country house.  Tony is perfectly content with their quiet country life with their precocious little son.  Brenda, however, is bored and stupid.  She longs for the shallow party life in London.  She lacks morals, brains, and taste.  She becomes involved with an equally shallow person, John Beaver.  He's a penniless fop, who relies on being invited to dinner and parties to keep himself fed.  You want to slap Brenda for being so stupid and selfish.  You want to shake Tony for not seeing through Brenda's web of lies.  Of course, her game can't last.  The second part of the movie takes us through twists and turns, and it all ends in a most surprising, thought provoking conclusion.

The acting is superb.  James Wilby is perfect as the likable Tony who turns out to have more backbone than we thought.  Kristen Scott Thomas makes us thoroughly dislike Brenda.  Rupert Graves is so completely different from his previous role as the gamekeeper in Maurice.  It is rather interesting that in their first movie together, Maurice, Wilby and Graves played gay lovers, and then in this movie (filmed immediately after Maurice) Graves was knowingly cheating with Wilby's wife.

The ending is intriguing.  I've thought about what I'd do in Tony situation at the end many times since first seeing this wonderful movie.",1235174400,5,1358,4.885964912280702

748961,4,6303980309,"So, I'm a little late.  I'm trying to find good British movies.  American movies are terrible. This movie is well written, cast, acted, and produced.  In short, Tony, the husband is a nut-case (albeit a nice one). Besides Brenda, he is in love with an old, really, really old house.  Naturally, Brenda, the wife, gets bored, really bored.  She would have to be because she finds her ""fun"" in another really boring, poor, younger,wimpy mama's boy. Old story told a million times.  But from this point on, this story is really different.  I enjoyed the twist.  It's one that you could never guess. I liked the movie.  It's understated as are most British films and I like that. I like their actors.  For the most part, they are classically trained and it shows.  I give it four stars because the British mumble a lot.  That's the bad news.  The good news is that you have to keep playing it over and over to figure out what the heck they said.",1206489600,2,941,4.464705882352941
748962,3,6303980309,"""A Handful of Dust,"" (1988), based on Evelyn Waugh's famous novel by the same name, a jazz-age satire, was made by London Weekend Television, which invested in an unusually strong cast for a television movie.  Perhaps as a result of this, the film received theatrical distribution, by Miramax, in the United States.

The film stars James Wilby as Tony Last, so involved in trying to live a nineteenth century lifestyle, and keep his estate Hettam afloat, that he fatally fails to notice his wife Brenda (Kristin Scott Thomas) is bored silly.  Rupert Graves appears as John Beaver, (he's what they used to call a bounder); Brenda mistakenly turns to him for solace and fun.  (And, of course, by doing so, she gives London's bored silly smart set something to gossip about.)  Dame Judi Dench plays Mrs. Beaver, John's opportunistic, shop-owning mother. Anjelica Huston appears as the helpful Mrs. Rattery; Stephen Fry as Brenda's callous brother. Alec Guinness turns in a bravura performance as  Mr. Todd, a man you don't want ever to meet.  But it can truthfully be said that each of the actors makes the most of his/her part.

The movie is beautifully filmed on location, in Brighton, East Sussex, and London, England.  Carlton Towers, Selby, in the north of England, North Yorkshire to be precise, stands in for Hettam.  ""Dust"" then moves on to what's supposed to be the Brazilian jungle, though it's actually filmed in Venezuela, around Angel Falls, the world's third highest. (Of course, we're to understand that this jungle is only slightly more bloodthirsty than that of London society.)

As is fairly well-known, movie and book are based, in part, on the breakup of Waugh's first marriage, and Waugh surely gets the last word on that (although the understanding is that Brenda's supposed to be stupid, as well as selfish, and Scott-Thomas is too smart, and observant, to be able to play stupid).  Waugh then, it's said, was at a loss as to how to finish this work, so he combined it with a previously-published short story set in the Brazilian jungle: because of legalities, he was actually unable to use this ending when the book was published in the States, and had to come up with another.

""Dust"" is handsomely filmed, and costumed, its cars and interiors are a treat, and it's got its author's flashes of mordant wit.  The acting can't be faulted.  But it's ultimately a downer, as is Waugh's book: these characters give us little to admire, and sure won't live happily ever after.",1188086400,10,2492,4.858156028368795
748963,1,6303980309,"I recently saw Brideshead Revisted which I found completely wonderful. It was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films I've ever immersed myself in.

 So, hungry for more Evenlyn Waugh (whose books I read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work), I found ""A Handful Of Dust"" at my library and figured I'd give it a try. Since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as Brideshead I was filled with anticipation.

 My wife and I watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments, and was certainly beautifully filmed, we were left cold by it. But we figured maybe after that the movie would develop.

 So we decided to continue it the following night. Big mistake!

 I only wish I could get back the time I wasted on it. While I don't expect ""Happy endings"" in a film (Brideshead certainly didn't have a ""Happy ending"") the ending in this story left me in disbelief.

 Since I didn't read this particular book by Waugh and didn't know its ending, I was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did. I was amazed by the stupidity of all I had just witnessed.

  I thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if Tony would ""toughen up"" a little, transform and grow from the circumstances of his ""captivity"" rather than just look like a pathetic fool.

 Perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching Brenda get what she deserved, still it wasn't enough to justify watching this film.

 This film was basically a ""series of unfortunate events"", with myself feeling most unfortunate of all.

 My wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than I did.

  Compared with a film like Brideshead Revisited, where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth, This story, was full of one dimensional characters. Dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery, well written music and excellent cinematography still didn't save the story from being like a bad ""twilight zone"" episode.

 If you look up my reviews, you will see that I don't go out of my way to give bad reviews, but I was so annoyed by the time I wasted I felt I need to share this. Of course I have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review, but I felt maybe I could spare someone else the wasted time.",1106697600,28,2472,4.528216704288939
748964,5,6303980309,"I will admit, I was not a fan of this film during the first fifteen minutes when it nearly went into the ""Period Film Sleeping Bag"" category, but after you get through this first hump (which is to wean out the naysayers) this is a very disturbing and thoughtful film.  In fact, I loved it.  It took me awhile to think about it after the first viewing, but I was very impressed.  Not only did this film break the boundaries of the dreaded ""Period Piece Snore-fest"", but also the standard of some films dating after 1988.  When I watch films from the 80s, I normally do not see this caliber of writing and intensity.  While it may have been around, most films were not ready to dive headfirst into it yet, but apparently Charles Sturridge has no fear. Instead, he gives us a biting story about social decline and satire, while all the while luring us deeper into this very depressive world.  Amazing actors, an extremely powerful story, and an ending that will knock your socks off, A Handful of Dust was an unexpected, yet much needed, surprise.

Feeling like a combination of Requiem for a Dream and Angels & Insects, this period piece film offers more than just torrid love affairs and snobbery, it gives us this brief, yet powerful, glimpse into a world turned upside down by the squandering of a woman.  I don't mean to sound sexist, but Sturridge does paint a picture where Kristin Scott Thomas' portrayal of Brenda does not paint a pretty picture of the perfect marriage.  When Tony is left time and time again with John Andrew while Brenda is off gallivanting around London with John Beaver, our emotions are not placed within Brenda's arms, we care about Tony and his reaction if he were to ever discover the truth.  Unlike other period piece films, we sympathize with the husband in this case, and ultimately open so wide to him that when the dramatic, and bizarre, ending occurs, we are left flabbergasted.  It almost doesn't compute, but then you think about it and realize that Sturridge is a brilliant director using techniques well beyond his time.

Kristin Scott Thomas does a great job with the material that she is given.  Her puppy-dog eyes seem to flutter and keep James Wilby's Tony at bay.  I think that is what fascinated me about her character was that she portrayed this feeling of innocence, yet she was in complete control of the situation.  That is why I think Rupert Graves' character was the most underappreciated of them all.  While some will see him as the villain of his film, I saw him as just a random person that happened to fall in love with a woman that reciprocated back, and happened to see the advantages of falling in love with her.  He wanted to get rich quick, and this was his answer.  Thomas could have stopped at any time and went back into the arms of Tony, but she chose not to, even with all of her innocence.  Guinness surprised the daylights out of me with his role in this film, well, I guess he always does.  Then there was Wilby, the most multi-layered character of the film.  He showed us all the true love does exist, and that good husbands do as well.  He did nothing wrong during the course of this film, yet somehow felt life hit him the most.  The events that happen during this film continually to the ending happened directly to him, not really to anyone else.  That surprised me.  Here was a man that had all the money in the world, a gorgeous house, and a family, but found that luck was never on his side.  Together, these three powerful plays hurdle through a tough film to give some genuine thought-provoking performances.

Then there was Sturridge who did his homework secretly in the darkness of his own basement to help bring this film to the silver screen.  Most of Hollywood would have probably changed the story to bring about some final satisfaction.  This is not the case with Sturridge who keeps the mood and themes of the film in constant view of us.  We consider these people high society, with their hunting moments and huge houses, but the reality of it is that they face the same troubles that we, the normal person, do daily.  They may have money, but they are human, and that is what Sturridge keeps with us during the course of the 118 minutes.  He captures your attention with the characters, throws in some Twilight Zone scenes, and allows your imagination to work overtime.  Anytime that a director pulls your mind into a film, the battle is already half won.  This was my kind of film.

Overall, I was very impressed.  This film broke me of my feeling that all period piece films were bad and dull, and had me drooling for more.  While I know that not all will be like this, I cannot wait to see what other directors will dive headfirst into this untapped pool.  The cinematography was pure 80s, the actors did their parts, and Sturridge brilliantly colored the themes and satires.  I was surprised (and still shocked) by this film and cannot wait to show it to others ... now that is the true test of a great film.

748965,5,6303980309,"Films haven't got much better than this recently. The jewel in inception and the making of this film which makes it is that the producers know the limitations of the ""great"" film and just how many ingredients of a great film, and also then elements of the stage, go into making this world-beating drama.
This is one of the most distinctive films which has been made therefore: a film which knows the entertainment context of film, drama, literature, the stage and then the television or movie-house film today. This is supreme entertainment.
In the same tradition and indeed category, without qualification or doubt, as the great pieces of cinema of old - ""as Lawrence of Arabia"" - this is a modern piece of dramatic art for the nineties and remains remarkably unchallenged in this decade. There are few films of the the last few decades which see so far ahead. Neither an enfant savage nor an enfant terrible - rather this film is as it knows these have been high or prevalent in the cultural climate, in the general cultural prescription. And these notions or identities are and have long been lurking in a culturally bound class (and country). This is embedded within the dramatisation of the tale. The compass of the film and of the story are great but limited.
I give it five stars because of the supreme, engaging and limited but total cinematic nature of this piece, which unexpectedly touches but also inspires the intellect with the emotions in making the story true by successfully refusing to explicate this human fantasy story in anyway; by its actual subtlety of treatment of the book; by giving the audience a direct light to see this literary tale.
And so also a more intellectual fable is given to the viewer on a silver platter, to indulge in without even a semblance of exertion.
Actually I would think it was a true story because of the devious, contextually ambiguous ending - which is not quite cunning. Should be seen and seen again and kept precious.",1057536000,12,1973,4.738372093023256
748966,4,6303980309,"This dramatization of Evelyn Waugh's novel is nicely done. The story concerns the marriage of Tony and Brenda Last, members of Britain's upper crust. From all outward appearances and, as far as the oblivious Tony is concerned the marriage is perfect. Brenda is bored and proceeds headlong into a destructive relationship with John Beaver, a man without personality or resources. Tony watches in denial and Brenda watches in self-absorption as their ""perfect"" world crumbles.

The dialogue in the film is remarkably faithful to the novel. With one notable exception, the actors quietly underplay the scenes, almost all of which involve tense and emotionally-wringing scenarios. This serves to underscore the absurdity of the ""stiff upper lip"" social mores of the time. The film stars James Wilby as Tony Last. Wilby is a dead ringer for the young Evelyn Waugh -- a nice touch given the story's autobiographical origins. Kristen Scott Thomas stars as Brenda.

About three-fourths of the film is set in London and rural Great Britain during the years between WWI and WWII. The remainder is set in the Amazon jungles. The film's score features native South American musical instruments throughout the scenes set in Great Britain which, again, serves to underscore the film's social themes.

Sir Alec Guinness dominates the jungle scenes as the amoral Mr. Todd. He's the one actor in this film who doesn't underplay his role. In this film, Guinness is unwashed, unshaven, scheming, hateful and maniacal. In short, he becomes ""The Man Who Liked Dickens"". I felt that his performance here was one of the best I've seen.

I rated this film 4 stars rather than 5 because there are one or two scenes which are so underplayed I would have missed them entirely had I not read the novel beforehand and been on the lookout for them.

Overall, this is definitely worth watching.",1031788800,,1863,5.016181229773463

7857885,5,6303980309,"Without any hesitation a full five star award . I despaired at Vile Bodies filmed as Smart young things  and Sword of Honour and was thinking that Waugh was just too difficult to bring to the screen but this wonderful production closely followed the book and was superbly acted and beautifully filmed .The story is very depressing ..there are no moments of melo drama but a continuous slide into sadness . The rotter in the story is a leach, a hanger-on , a scrounge who has somehow slithered into a respectable London club where he just tolerated . He visits a young titled landed family and , maybe egged on by his mother, sets his sights on the wife Lady Brenda , who is maybe just a trifle bored living in the country.. From there on , she makes a fool of her self and causes the despair and ultimate death of a very very good man . All the actors and actresses are superb ..I could see this over and over again",1479859200,,915,4.289017341040463
