Think this movie was produced by some LSD,and mushroom lovers. IF ur wanting useful knowledge of Tesla, go somewhere else.",1279497600,3,250,5.121951219512195
8058297,1,B0009835DW,"The DVD titled Novus Ordo Seclorum is a very poor tribute to Nikola Tesla.
It is a cartoon fairytale type representation with no reference to Tesla other than one liners coming across the screen stating some statement about Tesla.  This video is not a detailed factual story which demonstrates the genius of Tesla.  This DVD is not worth purchasing.  I would not waste money to purchase this video or DVD since it swindles folks into buying something that they believe has value but this DVD has very little knowledge value on Nikola Tesla.",1243900800,3,540,4.78494623655914
8058298,5,B0009835DW,"This is an extraordinary piece which combines music, imagery, science, and education in one truly original film.  It pays high tribute to the forgotten humanitarian genius of Nicola Tesla whose inventions were stolen and name erased from the history and science books in this country. Much of the information in this DVD was new to me despite the fact that i was well familiar with Tesla's life and work.  I recommend the film to teachers, students, and any type of new age folks who care about the future of the world and humanity.  Great food for the open mind and excellent tool to boost intellectual and spiritual growth.",1152835200,8,625,4.768518518518518
