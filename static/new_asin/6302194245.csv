Very down to earth and relatable, even if we don't all visit another country. This same story could still play out to some degree even in places of rural America. People and their connections are truly universal.",1170806400,,485,4.902439024390244

A true master. A true teacher, about the mastery of self.  If you are considering taking martial arts lessons, or seeking the qualitites of a true master and teacher this is a must film. Are you are trying to understand yourself through the rigorous regime of martial arts training? Then this film is for you.

436380,5,6302194245,"I discovered this movie about 10 years ago in a college library and was thrilled to find it on DVD. It is a tremendous slice of life that opened my mind, a true story that I still enjoy, and a cultural eye-opener everyone should have.

Iron & Silk is not a glossy Hollywood production, which makes the experience much more visceral. There is no dramatic training montage, no series of Wushu fights leading to a climactic confrontation. There is plenty of heart and soul in the characters. The conflict/resolution is of the every-day style and reminds one that our world is small only when our minds aren't.

Remember the idealism we had in our early twenties, that we could make things right by sheer force of will, or becoming self-defined iconoclasts? Mark Salzman's story captures that spirit without indulging in vainglorious self-aware examinations. And it holds true to the dreams of being something more, for the sheer joy of it.",1162857600,4,936,4.84375
436381,4,6302194245,"I spent several years living in Asia and this movie recaptured many of those memories.  While the movie is fairly honest it respectfully portrays Chinese culture from an American viewpoint.

The PG rating seems to be primarily for a handfull of obscenities in one or two scenes.  Nothing objectionable for even conservative viewers.  It may move a little slow for younger audiences and the volume gets very low in a few spots.  I highly recommend it.",1141344000,2,450,4.868421052631579

436384,5,6302194245,"Iron and silk (vhs) is such a simple movie based on the book also written and then acted by Mark Salzman. with his good looks and winning personality, this movie has a big quality of sweetness in it between the people of china and mark. there were misunderstands and misgivings about the different culture, but mark made the best of his time there.
the book is more of a series of short stories, and the movie try to incoporate the different scenes. the romance in the movie is that evident in the book, but it makes it more commercial. everybody wants a love story in their movies.

436385,5,6302194245,"Iron and Silk is a very fitting title...the movie is about contrasts, between the East and the West, between reality and perception.
Mark, an American who has had a passion for China and Chinese culture since he was young, lands a job as an English teacher in China. He learns a lot about life from his students.
Having watched many kung-fu movies, Mark asks Teacher Pan, a famous wushu master in the area, to teach him martial arts. At first, Teacher Pan refuses, claiming that Americans don't know how to ""eat bitter"", but eventually gives in. Neither Mark nor Teacher Pan know what to expect from each other----Mark is a fun-loving American in a foreign land, Teacher Pan is a tough guy with the nickname ""Iron Fist"".
Mark also falls in love with a woman named Ming, but he comes to understand that their love can never be a reality.
In the movie, Mark encounters all kinds of discrimination; despite his ability to speak Mandarin, he is still perceived as a foreigner. He also experiences closeness and friendship.
Mark gains an understanding of the nuances of Chinese culture, how China is a combination of politics, ancient history, and the individual lives of people. The movie has great images of serpentine rivers curving through canyons, as well as everyday scenes like busy markets and streets. This movie really appealed to me because I often feel caught between two cultures(my parents are rather traditional Chinese-Americans), though in a different way than Mark does.",1041465600,7,1483,4.912350597609562
436386,3,6302194245,"It's a shame that this movie didn't adhere more closely to Iron and Silk, the book by Mark Salzman on which it was based.  Instead, the filmmakers seemed to feel they had to simplify the relationships and adhere to the ""boy meets girl"" script that Hollywood is so fond of.  The results are disappointing and don't begin to do justice to Salzman's writing.
The story revolves around the two years Salzman spent as an English teacher in China.  There he studied with a variety of teachers, the most memorable being his martial arts instructor Qingfu Pan.  Although the filming is simple and some of the interactions a bit stilted, Salzman's childlike openness to new experiences and real skill as a martial artist come through.
Where I had problems was when the romantic relationship was introduced.  The woman that Salzman supposedly falls in love with appeared only at the end of the book, and was appealing precisely because she touched his life so briefly and was so inaccessible. In the movie, however, the relationship is treated as a central part of Salzman's time in China.  This simply wasn't true and used time that could have been better spent portraying the other fascinating people and places Salzman encountered.  I would have loved, for example, to see Salzman's calligraphy teacher, the barrel-chested, bald-headed man who taught him the art of ""pushing hands,"" or the artist who painted a landscape scene for him. It seems however, that the filmmakers had no faith in the viewing public's interest in Chinese culture or lifestyles.
This is a sweet movie, but it fails to live up to the remarkable potential of Salzman's book.  My advice is to skip the movie and get the book.",1018051200,7,1690,4.86411149825784
436437,4,6302194245,"This movie is based on the book written by Mark Salzman about his two years in China, where he went to teach English. The author stars in the leading role and shows us the intricate web of east meets west in a country that shuns western tradition. Salzman was lucky enough to be taught kung fu, known in China as whushu, by teacher Pan a world-renowned instructor in the field of martial arts who now resides in Canada.
This is a wonderful look into the life of the Chinese in the early 1980's, the feeling of revolution, the communist party, and how it affects the people. Spiritual pollution is in the forefront of those minds not yet ready for western ways to take root.
This was a most enjoyable movie with some precise and memorable kung fu scenes, even a bit of love.  Another book that I read recently by this author was LYING AWAKE.  Kelsana 1/13/02",1010880000,4,857,4.452229299363057
436438,4,6302194245,"In our contemporary American lifestyle many people are left to ask, ""Are my actions worthwhile?"" or ""Am I amounting to anything?""
In ""Iron and Silk"" Teacher Pan, a kung fu master, shows the audience the true meaning of a life's work.  Teacher Pan does not have e-mail, DVD players, or the wonderful Sony Play Station II.  However, Teacher Pan does have determination, grit, and honor.
As a new student of Kung Fu, known as wushu in China, I am beginning to realize the validity of the message portrayed in ""Iron and Silk.""  The message that Kung Fu is not just a martial art but a way of life.  As Teacher Pan says, ""Do every move as if it were your last.""  How often do we spend days, if not weeks, wasting our time with activities we truly do not care about? Probably far too many.
One of my favorite parts of the movie deals with Teacher Pan trying to learn English.  When Teacher Pan struts his speaking abilities to Mark, Mark replies that he did ""O.K.""  Immediately Teacher Pan replies in an angry tone, ""I do not want O.K. I want perfection!""
O.K. (This is the correct usage of the word!)  I've said my peace.  Think about your time and activities and ask yourself the question, ""Do I want to do everything O.K. or perfect?""  If you answered perfect start your commitment by watching ""Iron and Silk.""",1007251200,3,1307,4.476793248945148

436440,5,6302194245,"Iron and Silk is a look at China through the eyes of an American, Marl Salzman, in the period 1982-84.  It is a China in transition.  It is also a reality check for westerners visiting the country.  There are still concerns about too much western contact, as Mark discovers.  His first meal in  the communal dining hall is illustrative.  It isn't apparent at first but Mark is on a fairly short leash.  In spite of all this, he is able to make contact with citizens who in their own way are able to broaden his outlook and change his preconcieved notions.
This is a great family movie and the local talent that is used makes all the difference to this movie.  Looking at the credits at the end, you realize that the people in supporting roles who makes this movie successful.

It's a great look at the differences between East and West.  And it's a  great look at Chinese culture and society.  The book is really good.
The  film adaptation of the book is interesting.  It is very low budget but I  think that is what adds to the films charm.  The film is the opposite of a  slick hollywood production.  Instead the film is very down to earth and  wonderful.
Salzman changes some names around and adds a bit more of the  romance aspect.  The girl was a small part at the end of the book but a  major part of the film.
Bottom line is that like the book, the film is a  great glimpse at China, Chinese culture, and the differences between the US  and China.
My best suggestion is this: read the book and then watch the  film.  If you do both you will come out ahead and knowing a lot more about  China.",966470400,5,972,4.173913043478261

7822396,5,6302194245,"""Iron and Silk"" is a delightful book and film.  I had the pleasure of reading the book awhile ago; but was delighted to see the film in a local Asian film festival in my community.

The author Mark Salzman plays Mark Franklin in the movie of the same name.  It is a memoir (a true story) of Mark's travel and teaching experiences in China (Changsha, Hunan Province).  The events took place during 1982 - 1984 and Mark became as much of a student of Chinese life, martial arts, calligraphy, tai chi as he was a teacher of the Middle Aged English Teachers (a group of Chinese Russian teachers at the Hunan Medical College who had been told to forget Russian and now learn English).

Mark always wanted to be a Kung Fu master growing up, and he took lessons from a local teacher; but always felt like the smallest kid on the block.  From a young age, he loved all things Asian.  His mother was a musician and his father a social worker; but he found that he had developed an exceptional talent for the cello.  He was admitted to Yale at 16 because of his cello expertise; but soon decided that he would major in Chinese languages and philosophy (again not much of a surprise).  As part of a Yale program, he found himself traveling to Changsha, Hunan Province, China to teach English to a group of Chinese Russian teachers who were being asked to retrain.  For two (2) years he lived, taught and learned a great deal in China about the Chinese people and also about himself.

He always wanted to study martial arts from a true wushu master and was fortunate enough to find as his teacher, the grand master himself: Pan Qingfu (known as the Iron Fist).  Pan was the best in the world and was known as the Iron Fist because he punched a heavy iron plate 10,000 times a day!  Mark was also learning Tai Chi and Chinese manners and etiquette from Teacher Wei and calligraphy as well from other teachers.

Mark soon found that ""as a student in America, he had searched for ancient wisdom, as a teacher in China, he learned to find it in himself.""  Mark Salzman, when interviewed, stated: ""Learning about another culture doesn't mean you have to reject your own,  It allows you to see yourself from another perspective, see your good side and your bad side and appreciate what you have.""  Some will say that the book and the movie focus on martial arts and in part that is one of the major themes; but the blending and the co-existence of the two cultures in the classroom and in social interactions is illuminating.

There are many humorous and philosophical revelations in both the book and movie.  Telling Mark that he has a big nose by saying, ""You have a very 3 dimensional face""...is probably the most diplomatic way of stating the obvious.  Mark might have been able to name the book, ""Let's Make a Regulation"" if he wanted to only focus on the difficult aspects he faced in being a foreigner living in China. The Washington Post reviewed that ""Salzman demonstrates with skill and subtlety just how China society works.""

This Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1987 is dated; but describes the undercurrent that still exists in part today.  The movie's script stayed true to the book; yet the movie was shot in Hangzhou and not Changsha.  Make sure to stay for the vignettes and movie credits at the end; they are another joyful experience of the film and you will not be disappointed that you waited.  Mark found out that happiness was not a simple thing in China and though he valued being well liked and mastering a skill; his Chinese friend felt that ""these goals can be achieved easily.  All you have to do is to be kind and work hard.  But to eat and sleep well that is a difficult wish, because you cannot control these things yourself.""

One interesting note is that on the last night of the shooting of the movie, the brutal crackdown occurred in Tiananmen Square (June 3, 1989).

I loved this book and the movie and the delight that two very different cultures shared in learning about each other.  All that I can say is ""very well done"" (Manhaodilei!)

Mark really learned Qong Fu: a skill that transcends mere surface beauty!
