8605952,5,B00EJ4PLFW,I love the series. The DVD box set arrived around 1 week after the order. The disks I have watched so far are all good.,1412467200,2,119,3.8
8605953,1,B00EJ4PLFW,This DVD set was made for another country. I failed to read that in the description. The seller was nice enough to allow me to return the item and get refunded however it ended up costing me $40. They charged me a re-stock fee of like 20% and it cost me $10 just to ship the item back. I was  very disappointed. They did refund me quickly the 20% re-stock fee was a bit ridiculous but I learned a HUGE lesson from this. READ all descriptions even scroll all the way down before clicking the add to cart button.,1394755200,2,510,4.151515151515151

This product page now properly (and very clearly) identifies this set as being marked for region 4. It is a professional set, and played just fine. Despite the earlier lack of information about this being for region 4, I have changed my rating to 5 stars to reflect the quality of the product. My comments below are no longer relevant.

Caution:
Despite the text in the listing that this set plays in any region, the DVDs clearly state that they only play in region 4. My DVD player is for region 1, and it displayed the message that these were from the wrong region.

Now, I will see how easy it is to get a DVD player that plays in any region, and how well it works...

UPDATE: 12/14/13
Now, after having watched about half the set, I can report that the quality of the recordings and disks is good, and that had it played in the region advertised, I would have given it 5 stars.",1380412800,13,898,4.333333333333333
