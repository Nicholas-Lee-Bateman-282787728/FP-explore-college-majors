Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

After his big success with ""The Great Beauty,"" Paolo Sorrentino is back with an English language version of essentially the same story. In place of Toni Servilo as Jep Gambardella, an aging Rome journalist facing a mid-life crisis, we now have Sir Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a slightly older composer who also finds that he's stuck in a rut.

The setting here in Youth is a luxury resort in the Swiss Alps. The inciting incident resolves around an invitation from a representative of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip for Ballinger to conduct his most famous piece, ""Simple Songs,"" at Prince Philip's birthday celebration. Wouldn't you guess but Fred, the curmudgeon that he is, refuses, citing a lack of interest in pursuing music as a career at this late date.

There are other assorted characters at the resort including Ballinger's daughter, Lena, winningly played by Rachel Weisz. Lena works as her father's assistant but is also married to the son of Ballinger's good friend, Mick Boyle (played by an impressive Harvey Keitel), an aging filmmaker who also appears to have lost his mojo. When Lena is dumped by her husband she goes into a tailspin until she finds romance with a strange guy with a beard, a mountain climber, also at the resort.

Meanwhile Fred and Mick trade stories about women they used to know, particularly one who they both had an unconsummated relationship with. Unlike Fred, who still is talented, Mick has seen his better days, deceiving himself that his latest film which he is working on with a bunch of young screenwriters, is a ""testament"" of sorts.

Other odd characters show up including Paul Dano as Jimmy Tree, a frustrated actor remembered only for a commercially successful but aesthetically bankrupt role as a robot, Roly Serrano as a very overweight former soccer star Maradona, Luna Mijovic as a young masseuse who imparts sage advice to Fred, and Madalina Ghenea as an enigmatic and alluring Miss Universe who catches the eyes of both Fred and Mick while bathing.

Despite Keitel's efforts, he's unable to do much with the character of Mick, who turns out to be a real sad sack, particularly after his long-time leading lady Brenda Morel (sensationally performed by Jane Fonda), changes her mind about acting in his latest project and instead has agreed instead to act in a new television series. Brenda's decision results in (super spoilers ahead) Mick's suicide.

Ballinger's story is equally downbeat as he continually reiterates the fact that he's no longer interested in music mainly due to his invalid wife being unable to perform the part he wrote for her. Whether it was Mick's death or a visit to his wife who we find out has dementia (or a combination thereof), Ballinger rather predictably changes his mind, and ends up accepting the Queen's invitation.

Jep Gambardella's epiphany in The Great Beauty appears better thought out than Ballinger's, and the characters and situations in general are more compelling than what Sorrentino has proffered up here in Youth. Sorrentino's regular cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, continues to impress with all kinds of sensational shots and Youth is certainly worth watching for the visuals, instead of the feeble story.

One wonders if Mr. Sorrentino really has much more to say about life in general. Fred Ballinger's reclamation is hardly something to get excited about after experiencing all his downbeat ruminations throughout a narrative which was told much better in Sorrentino's earlier and much more impressive masterpiece.",1450569600,2,3596,5.069373942470389
7158895,5,B00X5XAY3W,"Michael Caine was told by the director that 'Youth' was written with him in mind. I like to think that it was written for many real and imaginary Michael Caines and viewers who like to feel and to think and to empathise, even if that was not intended.  It is an intellectual and an emotional film with some subtle  and sad sense of humour. The emotions are not new. The humour is delicate and the passing of time in the film and in the life of the characters and the viewers is unforgettable.

It is a longish, slowish film with all the inexorable flow of events, people and musical composition towards a denouement  which Shakespeare must have written about those many centuries ago, and is written again. The slight difference is that this time, the theatrical product is not about great kings but of the greatness in people who may or may not be kings, jesters, queens.  And, you have no time to fidget in your seat, or check your watch, or look at your companion. It is difficult to break all the new bonds , that have been set up without your knowledge or permission, with the director, the setting, the actors, the music and definitely with the joy and cruelty of 'Time' and 'Life.'

The muses come to writers, directors, actors, artists, and even politicians and chief executive officers, but the outcome is very seldom like the film 'Youth.'  The film is a tapestry woven with love, expertise and vision that one would like to hang in the  great hall of his mansion, castle of palace but in most cases will have to do so in the clutter of a personal abode of much smaller scale. In my case, the tapestry faces the wall. When I glance in its direction, I usually see the raw stitches and the mix of colours and threads which do not make much sense. But, every now and then, I flip the tapestry over to watch with awe and wonder at its ability to play its music for me.",1449964800,2,1875,4.398843930635838

8715126,5,B00X5XAY3W,"This is a beautiful, hypnotic, pensive, and powerful, yet life affirming movie from the award-winning director, Paulo Sorrentino.

Life Affirming is a term loosely associated with superficial films which have happy endings and feature upbeat, peppy songs as the audience leaves when the credits roll. These films   and Hollywood loves these films because it believes it will boost ticket sales   are incredibly shallow, one-dimensional, and a flash in the pan. This movie is not.

Youth is a loving, slightly Felliniesque, meditation on the crucial issues of human life. This film is truly life affirming because it affirms bedrock issues of life at its deepest levels, among them, choices or actions not taken, love lost, intimacy, lost youth, age, death. alienation, the remembrance of things past. These were the same themes director Sorrentino explored in his previous award winning film, The Grand Beauty. The only difference here is that these topics are examined though the lives of four individuals, not one.

This meditation is made through the lives of movies main characters:

First there is the orchestra conductor Fred Ballinger, played by Michael Caine.  Michael Caine has unfortunately been relegated in secondary roles in his recent movies. In Youth he shows what a good actor he can be when given a principal character role with a good script. He eschews his cockney accent for  posh Queens English. On the surface Ballinger/Caine is the picture of English reserve. Below, Ballinger is a tempest of regret on how he conducted his life as a husband, as a parent, and on choices he made and didn't make.

Then there is his American movie director friend, Mick Boyle, played by Harvey Keitel. This is Ballingers flip side. While like Ballinger at the final chapter of his life, he sees a bright future, and optimistically looks forward in creating his current film, which he describes as a masterpiece, and beyond. That optimism will prove to be very fragile when it is broken by the films main star, brutally portrayed by Jane Fonda, herself hardened by the tribulation of her own life.

These three, Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel and Jane Fonda all provide some of their best performances in years.

Two minor characters appear throughout the picture and supply the lost youth   hence the title    Caine and Keitel so desperately are trying to re-capture. One character is Ballinger/Caines masseuse, a young, comely woman, who reminds Michael on the need for intimacy and touch in human life. The other is Miss Universe, played by Madalina Diana Ghenea. Both parade in front of Ballinger and Boyle intermittently as if the remind them of their youth and what they are so desperately lack at this stage of their lives  intimacy and sexual potency.

There is Ballingers daughter, played by Rachel Weisz. She is going through her own crisis. When she learns that her husband, Boyle/Keitels son, is cheating on her and leaving her for another woman, all the past resentments on her upbringing spring to the surface, but does not destroy the affection she holds for her father.

Finally, there is the American actor Jimmy Tree, played by Paul Dano. He is disheartened by the fact that for all his meaningful movie roles, he is best known for playing an idiotic robotic monster in a fantasy film.

This menage of sorrow could have easily descended into a brooding Ingmar Bergman film. But it doesnt. Like any great Italian artist, Sorrentino brightens the malaise in this world with an effective use of brilliant color. Because the irony in all the inner torment of the characters is that their anguish takes place in a sumptuous, luxurious hotel, amid the spacious, breath-taking beauty of the Swiss Alps. In Sorrentinos lenses the Swiss Alps turn into pure eye-candy, brightening the characters gloom.

The facile feel-good movies so many reviewers may call life affirming do not have the depth of Youth, which ends on an optimistic, if ambiguous, note.

This movie surely should not be missed.",1452902400,6,4005,5.024205748865356
8715127,4,B00X5XAY3W,"The film centers around 80 something composer/conductor Fred Ballinger (Michael Caine). He is at an Alps resort spa with his daughter Lena (Rachel Weisz) and long time friend and director Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel). Fred is retired and has refused to conduct for the Queen. Mick is with a group of writers as they are attempting to come up with a script for ""Life's Last Day"" and spend their time attempting to compose final death bed endings for the film. There are a number of minor subplots and players at the resort so you can create whatever theme or metaphor you desire for the film.

The film was very artsy and theme driven. It appeared to focus on dreams and desires which are best left to youth, but I am sure one could get the opposite meaning. The film has a lot of good lines that appear that they tie things together, but then fall short.

""I have to believe everything to make things up.""
""Human beings know how to be pathetic when they try.""
""Emotions are overrated"" contradicted by ""Emotions is all we have.""
""I know you can't levitate.""

Rachel Weisz has a soliloquy where she nails it, but I wasn't sure what she nailed. Paloma Faith plays herself as an oversexed pop star. Madalina Diana Ghenea gets naked, which seems to be an odd sell point for an artsy film, but then again so did Michael Caine, and now I am blind.

One thing I can say for certain is this is not a formula film. It is a series of scenes, many of which are isolated with no real connection to the main plot.

People come to the spa to find themselves, realize their desires, and maybe make their dreams come true...",1451347200,2,1605,4.4271186440677965
8715128,3,B00X5XAY3W,"Few can construct a film quite as beautifully as Paolo Sorrentino, whose swelling, swooning The Great Beauty took home an Oscar just a couple of years ago for Best Foreign Film. His follow-up Youth is just as gorgeous; titillating the eyes with an endless array of images that will dance in the mind. Making only his second English-language effort after the misguided This Must Be the Place, Sorrentino's loose grip on American dialogue muddies what are surface examinations of his very familiar themes: age, regret, beauty, fame.  Youth is too mesmerizing to be completely dismissed, but for all its overtures towards weightiness it's not the ideas that linger.

Michael Caine, made-up to look nearly identical to The Great Beauty's Tony Servillo, plays retired maestro Fred Ballinger, holed up in a breath-taking Swiss resort with his somber and recently-separated daughter/assistant, Rachel (Rachel Weisz). He's there with his director pal Mick Boyle (Harvey Keitel) who is there to finish a screenplay for what he hopes will be his signature film.  The resort is populated with an array of colorful but ultimately forgettable characters. Paul Dano is an actor doing research on a mysterious new role that he hopes will make people forget the part he's famous for. There's also a fat ex-footballer lounging around the poolside, along with the newly-crowned Miss Universe.  These characters don't get much to do; they're only there to serve as visual representations of subjects Sorrentino doesn't really want to explore.  Case in point; Lena's husband recently left her for pop star Paloma faith, who gets the chance to play herself while demeaning everything about herself in the process. Seriously, she's mocked for her job and her looks throughout with nary a chance for rebuttal.

There isn't a ton that actually happens to move the story, such as it is, forward very far. Much of the film consists of Fred and Mick lounging around discussing their past loves, regrets, and future prospects. Mick is hopeful about his latest project, but that attitude may be a big mistake. Fred is occasionally requested by a royal emissary to conduct for the queen, which he consistently refuses for reasons that prove compelling and tragic. But the film languishes for far too long with little of note happening, mainly because its focus is split between these other characters we aren't interested in. It's best when Kaine, Keitel, and Weisz are center stage where they can be lavished by DP Luca Bigazzi's camera.  Weisz gets one of the strongest scenes in the film when Lena finally unloads on her father for basically being a neglectful deadbeat. In her only scene Jane Fonda commands everything as Mick's muse; pulling no punches with her thoughts on his latest project. These scenes work mainly because they cut through the remorseful cloud that seems to hang over everything.

Keeping you completely out of the doldrums is the witty repartee between Caine and Keitel, two screen veterans who are clearly enjoying a chance to riff off one another and reflect on the past. And of course Sorrentino keeps the visual standards high, using the locale as a consistently breath-taking backdrop.  He constructs images of such grace and beauty they can never truly be forgotten. They'll be recalled later when least expected, and will probably bring a smile to your face and the sudden urge to pop Youth in the Blu-Ray player. The film's final scene, best left undescribed, is one of those that will resonate even if the whole doesn't.",1450656000,,3526,5.0446735395189
