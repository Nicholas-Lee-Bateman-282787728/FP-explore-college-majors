7907331,3,B00000F4QQ,"LOCKE THE SUPERPOWER is a 1984 Japanese animated science fiction feature spotlighting the efforts of a psychic superhero to counter a hostile galactic organization of super psychics seeking to undermine the rule of the Earth Federation. It's done in a style harking back to 1970s anime with sharp, angular character design (with large tufts of unwavering hair) and limited movement. It is nonetheless an exciting and thoroughly unpredictable tale of action, psychic power and romance and will no doubt surprise those anime fans who can get past the odd design and solemn tone.
LOCKE himself is an intriguing character who has the appearance of a handsome teenager but is actually over 100 years old. He has an unusual look, with his oversized eyes, pointed chin, spiky expanse of green hair and perennially deadpan expression. He is quite strong and displays all sorts of powers, but almost meets his match in a young female psychic being groomed by villainess Lady Cahn who runs the psychic rebel outfit. The far-flung story takes these characters all over the galaxy, culminating in a battle aboard Lady Cahn's massive space station just as the structure is losing control to the gravitational pull of a nearby star.
The English dubbed version available in the U.S. had its title changed from LOCKE THE SUPERMAN--for obvious reasons (no one wants a lawsuit from the Man of Steel!), although the dialogue still refers to ""Locke the Superman."" It is 29 minutes shorter than the 120-minute Japanese-language release version, which includes many additional dialogue scenes and significant bits of violence, gore and nudity that were all edited out by Celebrity Home Entertainment so the film could be marketed in the U.S. as a children's video(!). The color is somewhat muted in the U.S. edition. Other major problems include the extremely poor quality of the English dub, with the voice actors sounding as if they were reading their lines for the first time, and an intrusive electronic score tacked on to the soundtrack. If any anime feature cries out for re-release in its complete form in its original language, it's this one.",1026604800,3,2128,5.065527065527066
