2469079,3,B000CQM2WQ,"I had much higher hopes for this dvd that weren't really fulfilled, I love all of David Lynch's work, and i had heard about these short films many times, but until this dvd had came out i had never seen them. I found that most of these were just boring. They also seemed like half formed ideas. The only ones i found interesting were The Grandmother and Lumiere, i really liked the latter. The other ones i found were just kind of boring.",1173916800,,438,4.289156626506024
2469080,4,B000CQM2WQ,"The films themselves are simple, odd and fun to watch; but the commentary by David Lynch is amaaaaaaaazing.  Slow and intensely weird while at the same time, somehow, warm and educational.  Lynch doesn't hold back about his beginnings, rambling on in his nostalgia.  He's one of those people who make you think, ""How can he be so serious about what he does?""  And then, you realize, you've just been thoroughly entertained.",1171929600,5,423,4.915492957746479

2469082,5,B000CQM2WQ,"Purrrr......I love David Lynch so I have a biased opinion.  But..I must say..my TV config ...I followed the instructions and I SWEAR LOL...it's amazing on how precise it works..the eerie music is scarey...but thats the trademark of this master. Try it.  Anyway..this is my first ever online review for any DVD I've ever bought from amazon.com so DAVID this is for YOU!!!  Your the master. I first saw Eraserhead when dvd's never existed.  However, I never forgot it.  I thank you for releasing this masterpiece back to the public.  I bought a VHS of it 4 years ago for $100.00 ...imagine.  Now the DVD and your shorts are available.  I have a customized frame poster of Jack Nance Eraserhead in my kitchen (which is full of Natalie Wood, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra, Hayley Mills, Steve McQueen, Jackie Gleason, Art Carney).  The head of the Eraserhead baby...is VERY similar to Lynch's ""art"" in his shorts.  Almost...sperm like.
If your a Lynch fan it will all come together.  The Grandmother...OMG...TOTAL LYNCH!!!  The child looks like a ""smaller"" or younger Michael J Anderson, white faced.  All I can say is...God loves me for giving me this wonderful gift :)Thank you David.

2469083,3,B000CQM2WQ,"the films are great, the lynch presence is there. i would oridnarily have no problem with this DVD, except for my original copy is missing the film ""the amputee"".  i returned it only to find the same defect in the same place.  that is the only reason i'm bummed.  otherwise all the stuff ive bought have been in very good shape^^  i still want another copy that works guys!!  thanks , John",1141776000,7,389,4.347222222222222
2469084,4,B000CQM2WQ,"It's really nice having this collection around.  Lynch's short films are important because they are a more potent and unabridged form of his style and work--he has a lot more freedom with the form, and thus can do basically whatever comes to mind, versus making things feature length which also means making them feature-like.

Some are better than others.  Some are wildly out there.  Overall they're great fun to show to friends for that whole, ""What the--?"" value when they're unfamiliar with who you're presenting, and anybody who is familiar with the material will enjoy it anyway.

I don't know where I stand on Lynch's introductions, though.  On one hand, it's nice to have a back story so that the viewer knows not only what he's watching, but how it came to be and thus, to a degree, what it means.  However, some of it gets pretty tedious.  I relate to a lot of Lynch's emotions when he describes the processes and events that got him into film, but still, I'd rather just get to the film.  The DVD this comes with has the nice ability to go right to the films from the menues, but there's no ""play all without introduction"" so that can be tedious too.

But overall, definitely worth the time and effort to find and watch this.

2469086,3,B000CQM2WQ,"So...this is an OK DVD.

Lumiere is my favorite (albeit only 55 seconds long).  Its pretty tight.

Six Men Getting Sick is neat...very short.

The Alphabet is neat...also very short.

The Grandmother - this one is about 30 minutes.  It has a bizarre, abstract feel to it, much like Eraserhead.  My problem with this one is Lynch's choice to go between film and animations.  The animations were very crude...seriously, it looked like a small child drew them.

The Amputee - I would skip this one.  A woman is sitting on chair with bandages on her leg stumps, writing in a diary.  A man is adjusting(?) the bandages and it starts bleeding.  It goes on for about 5 minutes...I found it uninteresting and boring.

I haven't watched the Cowboy & the Frenchmen yet.  I didn't care for the premise.

In summary, I personally liked 3 of the films and would watch them again.  Unfortunately they were the three short ones, so I spent 20 bucks on about 6 minutes worth of video I like.  To each their own, im sure true Lynch fans will still be satisfied.",1137715200,11,1044,4.526881720430108
2469087,4,B000CQM2WQ,"I saw The Grandmother and The Alphabet on the big screen in London way back in 1990 (on the same bill as Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, what a night!!), and had been trying to get my hands on them for years. I was so happy when Lynch finally released them (and the other films on this DVD) from his website a few years ago. I bought it as soon as it was available, and fell in love with his weirdness all over again. Fans of Lynch will love owning these films, but they aren't really for everyone.

It's easy to see the seeds of not only Eraserhead, but many of Lynch's later films in the early short films. The later entry, for the Lumiere DVD, is also exceptionally Lynchian. I could do without The Cowboy and The Frenchman, but all in all would recommend this for anyone who has seen and loved Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, or Mulholland Drive.

Some of the best parts are the introductions by Lynch before each film. He's so normal it's bizarre!! Great to have this collection and the new(ish) Eraserhead DVD available on Amazon!",1134950400,12,1039,4.43455497382199
2469088,4,B000CQM2WQ,"This collection of David Lynch's short films was originally only available through his Web site. This new edition is reportedly the same disc with different packaging (it lacks the oversized box and booklet of the first version), but it's considerably cheaper. You can watch each film with or without an introduction by Lynch. The films are:

SIX MEN GETTING SICK - This animated one-minute movie was Lynch's very first film. It was originally part of a multi-media piece and was projected over a sculpture on a continuously running loop. The title is an accurate description of the film, as several human heads become inflamed, catch fire, and vomit copiously. It's worth noting that, while 99.9% of movie directors become filmmakers because they're into films, Lynch came to filmmaking purely as an extension of his painting, and was never a movie buff. I think that simple fact goes a long way in explaining Lynch's originality as a director.

THE ALPHABET - A combination of animation and live action, this approximately 5-minute film is ""about the fear of learning,"" according to Lynch. The soundtrack consists of children repeatedly chanting the alphabet, while animated letters seem to excrete and procreate and a woman in white-face cowers in a bed and eventually vomits blood (vomiting figures strongly in Lynch's early film work). It's a concentrated and eerie piece of surrealism.

THE GRANDMOTHER - A lonely, abused boy grows a grandmother from a seed in this, Lynch's first attempt at narrative (of a sort). There's some animation, but live action dominates. It's crudely made in comparison to his first feature, Eraserhead, but it's clearly the product of the same singular artistic vision.

THE AMPUTEE - Back around the time he was making ERASERHEAD, Lynch was offered some videotape for free, so he used it to shoot this short bit of black comedy. It stars Catherine Coulson (much later she became the Log Lady in TWIN PEAKS) and Lynch himself.

THE COWBOY AND THE FRENCHMAN - Made for French TV right after he finished BLUE VELVET, this is a virtually plotless exercise in comic surrealism, plopping down an absurdly stereotypical Frenchman (he wears a beret, and carries a bottle of wine and snails in briefcase) in the middle of a ranch inhabited by several stereotypical cowboys. It looks like it was mastered off a videotape source, which is odd. I wonder  if the original film elements were lost.

LUMIERE - Originally titled PREMONITION FOLLOWING AN EVIL DEED, which I personally like a lot better than LUMIERE. This was made for the film LUMIERE AND COMPANY, in which acclaimed directors from all over the world were given a Lumiere camera (the very first motion picture camera) and asked to make a movie with it. Since the camera could only hold 55 seconds worth of film, the directors were retsricted to that running time. They also were not allowed to edit. If you've seen LUMIERE AND COMPANY, you know that Lynch's film is by far the most interesting and imaginative of the bunch. He ingeniously got around the prohibition against editing by constructing several sets side-by-side, and blocking the lens momentarily while he moved the camera to the next scene. The movie goes by in a flash of bizarre black and white images. Was that a naked woman floating in a huge glass tube? And what were those humanoid things and what exactly were they doing? You have to watch the film several times to begin to get a clear idea of what you've seen.

These shorts represent the more abstract side of Lynch's film work - they're much more the work of the Lynch who made ERASERHEAD than the Lynch who made THE STRAIGHT STORY. Your average Joe Filmgoer would hate them. But if you're a Lynch fan and haven't seen some or all of these films, you'll definitely want to get this.",1134691200,157,3792,4.859133126934984
2469089,5,B000CQM2WQ,"There's obviously more that could have been included like his other documentaries, but in any case when it comes to his short films & his recollection of them this is excellent. Starting from 6 men getting sick you'll be sucked into his world till the end. Also it has other small funny features.",1380931200,,296,4.60377358490566
2469090,1,B000CQM2WQ,"The DVD came in a clam shell box that had some sort of little red square plastic lock on it with only the words ""Red Tag"" on it.  The thing absolutely prevented me from opening the box.  For a half hour I tried pushing, pulling and prying on it trying to remove it so I could get the DVD out.  Finally I just grabbed the box and tore it completely asunder.  THE RED SEAL STILL COULD NOT BE MOVED IN ANY WAY!  Now what kind of an idiot would design such a thing is beyond me.  I have a couple of thousand DVDs on hand so I am not inexperienced in them, but this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in packaging.  Whoever dreamed up this bit of crap deserves the Moron Of The Year Award.",1292371200,4,687,3.9708029197080292
2469091,3,B000CQM2WQ,"""The Short Films of David Lynch"" compiles six of David Lynch's short films.  Two were made while Lynch was a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art.  These are ""Six Figures Getting Sick (Six Times),"" a three-minute loop of nauseating animation and sound seemingly consciously or subconsciously designed to make the audience sick, and ""The Alphabet,"" a disturbing, bloody incarnation of one of the former Mrs. Lynch's nightmares.  ""The Grandmother"" is the longest of the shorts at just over half an hour, and was the first film Lynch shot at the American Film Institute.  ""The Amputee"" features young Catherine Coulson, the Log Lady of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twin-Peaks/dp/B000UX6THK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twin Peaks</a>,"" and was shot to test film stock while Lynch tried to secure funding for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraserhead/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraserhead</a>.""  The subtle slapstick and absurdity of ""The Amputee"" is amusing.  It's the first of the six pieces in which Lynch seems to be discovering himself as a filmmaker.  Its predecessors are avant-garde bulls--t, interesting but unorganized, lacking purpose or theme, experiments in which Lynch searches for himself at the cost of emotion and humanity, those feelings which compelled his greatest works.  The final segment was Lynch's contribution to the ""Lumiere"" project, in which filmmakers created a minute-or-so silent film in a single take on the Lumiere brothers original Cinematographe camera, the greatest cinematic technology of 1895.  What Lynch's Lumiere film achieves in 52 seconds is intriguing, as well as disturbing, and surreal, even by Lynch's high standards of surrealism.  The crown jewel of the collection is ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman,"" a 25-minute short created for French T.V., featuring Lynch regulars Harry Dean Stanton and Jack Nance.  Lynch's knack for comedy is often overlooked.  It shines in ""The Cowboy and the Frenchman,"" Lynch's hilariously absurd vision of the French.  A scene in which Stanton's fellow cowboys unpack the titular Frenchman's suitcase is one of the most enjoyable and outrageous Lynch has filmed.",1289347200,3,2240,5.9625

2469094,5,B000CQM2WQ,"What is it about old short films with grain, textures, and lo-fi sounds that make it so haunting?

I've never quite been able to state whether I love David Lynch's work or hate it.  But I can't deny that he's always been intriguing.  These films are quite frightening and yes, of course they're bizarre and strange.  As I mentioned, the textures, the contrast, the audio, the characters and stories... all the elements combine to produce some really amazing and beautiful work.  You'll get basically nothing as far as the traditional narrative here, but there is so much more to work with.  If you're familiar at all with the Brothers Quay, this would be a definite buy for you.

Of the Lynch features I've seen, I'd probably say that ""Eraserhead"" and ""Inland Empire"" are the most comparable to the short films on this disc.  Take it for what it's worth, could be good or bad.  I think that his early work embraces the experimental, and he capitalizes on the fact he is working with a short film, not a feature.  I really love these pieces, having previously only seen ""Luminere""

I will assume that most people at least have some idea of what David Lynch can be like... so take that into account if buying this collection.  I think the films are great, but they're definitely not for everybody.  One huge attribute to this collection is the short intros given by the director before each film (option to watch with or without)

2469095,4,B000CQM2WQ,"This is some pretty cool stuff by David Lynch.  While I haven't been able to see Blue Velvet (already a contender to be one of my favorite movies, but I have to see it) or Eraserhead, well no matter.  I have no clue about weird film directors besides Lynch, but matter not.  It's some cool watching.

The short films on here are pretty great, and the Grandmother, The Alphabet (that one rules) and the six men getting sick are worth the price alone.  David Lynch gives some great tricks..  I love his live action shooting in this one.  It's extremely dark and his lighting is totally weird.  Just check out the Grandmother, with Matt (well, that's what the parents yell, one of the only lines in the whole movie) and his creepy room, a weird looking bed in a black backdrop.  Pretty cool.  The Alphabet has some sinister looking faces, and is supposed to be about the life cycle (and was inspired when someone he knew was saying the alphabet in a tormented way)  David Lynch does some great introductions as well.  Great acting, really, just some cool stuff.

It's a great DVD.  This one is just worth seeing just to see it's many cool images.  A must watch, maybe not a must own, but a must watch.",1218240000,,1198,4.431192660550459
2469096,4,B000CQM2WQ,"David Lynch is my favorite director of all times. He stands on top, side by side with Stanley Kubrick, in my opinion. I've been watching his films over and over again since I was 16 and it's always a new experience. Every single time I discover new meanings, new interpretations, new compelling details, which is wonderful but also frustrating, in a way: when I think I'm pretty close to fully understand his art, I have to re-think it all.
But ""The Short Films"" came as a fundamental help to my efforts. There is where it all began and there I found the seeds (it's funny to see how the seeds are a constant in his early works, from ""The Alphabet"" to ""Eraserhead"") of his unique art.
The DVD includes the following works:

-- Six Men getting sick
-- The Alphabet
-- The Grandmother
-- The Amputee
-- The Cowboy and the Frenchman
-- Lumiere

I can see clearly a path connecting the first three films. In the odd ""film painting"" of the Six Men Lynch establishes one of his staple subjects: the birth/generation (the life!) as a sickness; then he depicts learning as a traumatic experience in ""The Alphabet"" and finally ends this unorthodox trilogy with that ""nightmare of growing"" called ""The Grandmother"".
""The Grandmother"" is definitely a complete film and his first, disturbing masterpiece: I think this alone is worth the price of the DVD, an absolute must-see.
The remaining three works are less interesting. I see in them more mannerism and less significance, while ""The cowboy and the Frenchman"" is fun (thanks to Harry Dean Stanton!) and very reminiscent of the humour of ""Twin Peaks"".
I would have enjoyed some extras, but now my Lynch collection is complete and I'm very glad of my purchase.",1199232000,7,1700,4.720538720538721
2469097,4,B000CQM2WQ,"It doesn't seem to affirm David Lynch was the most legitimate and visceral minimalist filmmaker of that generation. This artistic conception emerged in 1965, defying the lyricism, the abstract expressionism and pop art' figuration searching renovated forms of abstraction, based on the simplicity of  colors and geometrical shapes.

In this brief but curious release, we will appreciate the first steps and concerns of this young promise.

Six sick men and the alphabet are featured by elemental and animated drawings, which dates us back to a sort of blend of aesthetic primitivism, accusing influences of Fauvism and Constructivism.

The grandmother is perhaps his most ambitious project. A surrealistic nightmare works out as preamble to a lonely child, incapable to establish no communication with his parents, and so he decides to become an apprentice of alchemist, creating that grandmother. Permeated by a gothic atmosphere and audacious chromatic games and expressionistic shots, he achieves - to my view- a fascinating,, outrageous and macabre tale , a dark metaphor about the alienation and  horrid loneliness.

The amputee is, although its briefness, a caustic tale where the shocking images describe by themselves, the serene bitterness of very alluring woman.

Finally, The cowboy and the Frenchman, is an enraptured, sardonic and iconic tale where Lynch intermingles some folkloric elements, typical of both cultures.

It is interesting to realize how this provocative feminine choir, would be employed by Lynch in ""Mulholland drive.""",1195689600,2,1548,5.5574468085106385
