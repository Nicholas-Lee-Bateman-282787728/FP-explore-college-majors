8401823,4,B001MUORRO,"A fun western, with honest, stalwart Jeff Chandler, pretty songbird/schemer Anne Baxter, and sneaky Rory Calhoun.  I wish the DVD quality could have been a bit better.  Overall the quality was okay, but there were a few scenes where the color appeared to be a bit washed out.  I'm glad I ordered this movie and would recommend it to others too.",1430697600,,344,4.60655737704918
