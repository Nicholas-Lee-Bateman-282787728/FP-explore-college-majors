This is the work of a master filmmaker, who has produced a number of Documentaries, about one of our greatest, caring presidents. Jimmy Carters reputation was hurt when he could not get the hostages back,  many consider him a clown and a weak leader.  Watch this documentary and see him trying to find a balance that includes the Palestinians.  Most peoples idea of the documentary is formed by the television documentary with the voice of God narrator, The style of this is more Cinema Verite but it is not trying to give the illusion of objectivity. I recumbent Jimmy Carter Man from Plains to anyone interested in Jimmy Carter, the man; The Middle East, Modern American History, and /or the documentary form. This is the real deal done by a great filmmaker",1392422400,,878,4.718954248366013
