8196348,1,B000QGDJHE,"Like MANY of the reviewers of the ""George C. Scott Signature Collection"", I want more than any other title to get ""The Flim Flam Man"" on DVD and from the manufacturer.  Past requests have resulted in being routed to soure that sells COPIES (and not very good ones), and being a high-volume buyer from Amazon and becoming increasingly aware of what I want many others want also, I'm very surprised that with your purchasing power you don't exert more influence in convincing the manufacturer to re-issue, similar as what was done with ""Lonely are the Brave"", another much-sought item which was just recently re-issued.",1247961600,2,617,4.9326923076923075
8196349,5,B000QGDJHE,I liked these two movies of George C. He was as good in this movie as he was in the first movie Patton.  Jane Eyre was great with him.  He should have played in more movies like this one.,1238803200,,187,3.769230769230769
8196350,3,B000QGDJHE,"What can I say? The word mediocre comes to mind out of a vast library of better George C. Scott movies. These are far from his best or at least what I would consider a Signature Collection. Many of his best aren't even available on DVD. If they want to make me happy they need to put ""The Flim Flam Man"", ""The List of Adrian Messenger"", ""They Might Be Giants"", ""Oklahoma Crude"", ""Rage"" and ""12 Angry Men (1997)"" on Region 1 DVD. If you enjoyed these catch ""Patton"" and ""China Rose"".

P.S. Any chance we can tell whoever is holding these up from DVD that George said he would use their living guts to grease his tank treads?

8196351,1,B000QGDJHE,When I ordered The Flim Flam Man with George C. Scott I received this disc which did not contain that movie.  To boot I got two copies of the same movie.  Not cool.,1187827200,9,164,3.9393939393939394
8196352,3,B000QGDJHE,I agree with the other gentleman.  I wanted Flim Flam Man and instead I got movies we already have.  This was supposed to have 3 movies on it and I am really disappointed with Amazon.  I have been ordering forever and this is the first time I have been let down.,1187308800,3,262,4.098039215686274
8196353,3,B000QGDJHE,"Ok, I DID buy this sight unseen because it was only $3.98 and I was hoping to get ""The Flim Flam Man"". Although the movies on this DVD still aren't listed as of this writing, I can help there.

First, there are two movies only, originally there were supposed to be three. They are ""Last Days of Patton"" and ""Jane Eyre"".

I already have ""Last Days of Patton"" which has been floating around in various discount bins. I like the movie. It picks up where ""Patton"" left off and tells the story of his work in Germany after the war, his accident and subsequent death. If you're a Patton fan, it's a good biography; there are also some flashbacks of George as a young officer and tank commander. The movie is a little long, but I happen to like that. George is way older and fatter than he was in ""Patton"". But I enjoy the movie and I learned a lot of details I didn't know before.

As far as Jane Eyre, I can't say; I haven't opened this yet, and may re-gift it. It was made for TV in 1970 (""Last Days of Patton"" was made for TV in 1986). But I may get curious about the new remastering done for this DVD and see if picture quality has improved.

Personally I'm disappointed that I didn't get ""The Flim Flam Man"" or some older film-noir, but at least now you know what's here and can make your decision.

(update)

Well, I decided to watch Jane Eyre. I really enjoyed Susannah York's performance, she was into it and was the real star. George must have been preoccupied with the results of the ""Patton"" auditions, because he didn't really enjoy the role. His lines sounded stiff and stilted, phony accent, etc. I half expected him to pull up in his jeep and say ""Jane, marry me or I'll use your living guts to grease the treads of my tank"". This was a low budget, playhouse style production. But I enjoyed watching it, overall.

Transfer quality on both movies was poor, no improvement there. This set is not suitable for re-gifting, in my opinion. But considering the low price, a worthwhile purchase if you are curious about either movie.",1186704000,12,2085,4.497354497354498
8196354,3,B000QGDJHE,"It would be of GREAT HELP if Amazon would name the two movies that are on this DVD. Since Scott made dozens of movies, obviously I am not going to buy it without knowing what I am getting. With all of the other details in the listing, is it too much to give a minimal description of the DVD - at least the movie titles??????",1186185600,16,324,4.0
