8466883,5,B005DIWVMY,"I got a lot out of this DVD conference with the convenience of watching at my own pace.  Well worth the money, even if you only watch half of the sessions.",1353888000,,155,4.0

8466885,5,B005DIWVMY,"This conference contains some of the most important information of all times concerning diet, health, and anything relating to them. I especially enjoyed the GAPS lecture, since I have had personal experience on the GAPS diet (with tremendous success and healing). I highly recommend this DVD. It contains so much medical information that isn't mainstream. Folks, you are being deceived. Watch this DVD and become enlightened. You owe it to yourself to understand your own healthcare. At $41.00, it's a deal you can't afford to pass up.",1335398400,2,536,5.172413793103448
8466886,4,B005DIWVMY,"Up to the minute and evidenced based stuff with stacks of insight research and analysis as well as general informative discussion-all the science stuff explained brilliantly --understand alot of words that doctors bandy about  now !!Thought provoking and life changing stuff with practical take home solutions to try with regard diet and health-  filming good quality- Variety of seminars ,so something for anyone interested in food health,supply, medicine or the disturbing path our health services are being taken down by the drug companies. Excellent on Cholesterol and saturated Fat and the impending Diabetes and dementia epidemic and the role  diet may play  Did not watch a few parts of it that did not interest me but majority of stuff did--will try to attend conference next year as a result of DVD--Highly recommend",1324166400,4,825,5.2272727272727275
8466887,5,B005DIWVMY,Has all very good presenters and incredibly good information. I must say the info that Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride gives is some of the best. The gut truly is where almost all illness begins (like Hippocrates said!) and she knows how to heal the gut and bring back health. It is amazing how much information about health through nutrition is kept from the public. Dr. McBride's work on heart health is just as good. I highly recommend this conference.,1321142400,5,452,4.8076923076923075
8466888,5,B005DIWVMY,"Excellent value for money!  Every seminar presentation in this compilation of the London conference has valuable information. Campbell-McBride is, as expected, especially enlightening.",1321056000,,184,7.0
8466889,5,B005DIWVMY,"We really are fortunate these days to have some rather unprecedented access to many of the best and brightest minds in nutritional thinking than ever before in human history. Before the Internet went mainstream in the late 1990's and later spawning daily hubs of invaluable information that combat the conventional wisdom seen in traditional forms of media, your sources for health data came primarily from television, radio, books, magazines and the like.

But not anymore!

Now we have professional blogs, sophisticated and interactive web sites, YouTube videos and engaging podcasts to help replace the mind-numbed and ever-so-predictable cookie-cutter diet and health stuff we've really never had access to before. These are exciting times we live in!

Pandora's box has now been busted wide open and there's a whole new world of people, thoughts and ideas being disseminated out there all in an effort to combat the heavily-promoted high-carb, low-fat lie that has kept us mired in chronic disease and obesity for far too long. We truly have a golden opportunity to help re-educate people about what constitutes a ""healthy"" diet and I'm grateful to be playing a small role in that effort on the blogging and podcasting front.

But there are some amazing people involved in organizations like The Weston A. Price Foundation not just in the United States, but around the world spreading the truth about healthy, real food nutrition based on the traditional diets of those who have gone before us. Hearkening back to the days not that long ago before obesity, diabetes and heart disease were all unheard of (it's hard to believe this is only something that has happened just in the past century of human existence) is a recipe for reversing the negative impact our modern-day diet and lifestyle is having on our general health and well-being.

I didn't realize there was an active Weston A. Price Foundation Chapter in London, England led by raw milk lover Philip Ridley who cured his lactose intolerance in 2008 by adding this real food to his diet for the first time in his life. It totally rocked his world and made a believer out of him of the importance of consuming real foods in his diet. Although the U.S. version of the Weston A. Price Foundation's Wise Traditions Conference happens annually in the month of November, the UK version of this incredible conference in 2011 was a smashing success back in March 2011. Best of all, all 14 hours of the event was captured on video and is now available.

So, you wanna know what's on this 4-disc DVD? Check this out:

The Moo Man movie preview

You should already be familiar with several of these names from their previous appearances on my ""Livin' La Vida Low-Carb Show"" podcast. And I'm working on interviewing Dr. Campbell-McBride for my podcast to discuss her unique Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) concept hopefully in early 2012. But this DVD set gives you a TON of fantastic information on important health topics such as gut health, heart disease, obesity, stress, low-carb diets for diabetes, high-fat foods for optimal health, fertility, cancer, foraging for plants, farming, and raw milk. This four-disc set is a fabulous way to spread the message to skeptical friends and family members who would never attend a Wise Traditions conference. Plus, it will strengthen your own knowledge base about what you believe and why you believe it! GET THIS DVD!",1320105600,14,3858,5.0886075949367084
