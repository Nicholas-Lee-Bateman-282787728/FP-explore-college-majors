The creator/writers continue to build on the silly yet lovable personalities of this soon to be classic anime series. This collection is packed with giggle inducing episodes, the absurdly funny continuing saga of Normad, the super computer housed in a stuffed animal and all the one liners you would never expect to find in a thirteen and up rated anime series. I highly recommend this to any and all fans of this pop culture craze and you will get many hours of entertainment for your money.
P.S. Buy it today, you won't be disappointed",1268870400,,662,4.815789473684211
