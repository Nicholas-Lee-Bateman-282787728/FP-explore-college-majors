8322278,4,B001MWGZ7C,"A ninety minute informative look at Hugo Chavez.

I've seen a couple of interviews with Chavez. Depending on you who ask you may get different answers. Frontline did a smart thing by basically have Chavez speak for himself through footage of his  Alo Presidente show. You get people talking about Chavez as well but having Chavez basically speak and act for himself adds crediblity which leaves very debate about the type of person he is.

After watching this you can only conclude that the man is one paranoid, corrupt dictator. He abuses his power by shutting down ratio stations, attacks any critic unmercifully, fails to follow through on his promises to his people and on and on.

The episode documents this pretty well.

What fascinated me about Chavez is how he is so much like the disgraced, pitiful former President George W. Bush.

Chavez passes himself as a liberal to appeal to the Venezuelan people. This is how he got elected. However, many of his ""liberal"" policies don't seem to reach their goal. When you learn the reasons behind it, you don't think this guy is a liberal at all. For instance they talk about a cooperative program made to make more jobs for textile powers, yet many of the workers make about a hundred dollars, not enough to live on.

Chavez's power which is well documented here is Chavez's ability to control the oil wealth in Venezuela. He uses heavy handed and illegal tactics to get that objective.

Is that wealth distributed back to the people of Venezuela? The answer so far is no. The program doesn't seem to mention one success Chavez has had. We even see him belittle guests and reporters on his Alo Presidente show when these failures or perceptions of failure are even mentioned.

Next in the episode, Chavez seeks to change the constitution for himself.

Chavez as stated makes himself to look like a liberal, but the results so far don't point his administration as anything but liberal. As I said, he and Bush seem eerily similar. It's a riot that the two had a feud.

One thing this episode does not go into detail at all is the failed coup against Chavez sponsored as always by CIA.
They had plenty of time to document it here but it's merely mentioned.

Despite this, this is a very informative episode giving you a big picture of Hugh Chavez.",1252454400,,2296,4.669975186104218
8322279,3,B001MWGZ7C,"Talk about perverting FDR's fireside chats.  This work is mostly about how Chavez uses his ""Alo Presidente!"" to wield absolute power.
This work had many surprising facts in it.  It said that by admitting defeat in a coup is how Chavez gained power.  The work says Cuba needs Venezuela, not the other way around.  Many Americans loved W's ""folksiness"" and recently Jindal tried to imitate it to no success.  Here you see Chavez singing and they call some of his acts ""buffoonish.""
This work does show how absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Chavez may throw around the term ""equality,"" but he really wants to be the head of his nation forever, just like Mugabe does.  Still, the people have voted down many of his measures, so they may be savvy voters despite their poverty.
One thing stood out to me:  his program seemed to be a way to blame those in his cabinet for his blunders.  It is a way for others to take the heat.  This reminded me of the inconsistency of Amin shown in ""The Last King of Scotland.""  Still, when Chavez closed a popular TV station, the people were upset because they couldn't see their favorite soap operas, politics were not the issue for them.  It's fascinating how Chavez has mastered some of Machiavelli's principles but also failed at many of them.
Still this work left some things out for me.  Much is made of Bolivia's Evo Morales being indigenous.  However, Chavez looks VERY indigenous to me.  He is one of the few Latin American leaders who is clearly not of European phenotype, yet his obvious ethnic background is never brought up here.  The work states that Venezuela needs the US to transform its crude oil into something more sophisticated. However, I swear I heard that Chavez once gave oil to bus companies that transport poor Americans to work.  So I get the sense that Chavez has power in the US that this documentary ignores.  Also, if left wing politics are so terrible, then why are they being embraced more and more in South America?  Why is it a winning ticket there?  I'm just not willing to throw Chavez and his fearlessness in front of Uncle Sam just yet, even as this work portrays him as a complete victim.  Please also note that almost all of the interviewees here were male; this does make me wonder if politics is highly gendered in that nation.",1237161600,2,2303,4.623152709359606
