My mom tried to be sneaky when she was ordering this, however, she used my account because she doesn't have one and forgot that Amazon sends updates to your email about the products you buy!

8531571,5,B008X0XHAE,"If you love Fun comedy romance then this is a movie for you, This movie starts out explaining the characters and for some it could be a little slow but let me tell you this is so worth having...It's fun, and silly, and full of laughter, and maybe a few tears. Lee Dong Wook plays Park Mu-eul, a tough, hot tempered, baseball player who has to hire a bodyguard  Yu Eun Jae, played by lee Si-Young, who by the way can't stand the baseball team that her boss plays for, so conflict between the two begins and so does the start of a very slow relationship where eventually they fall in love...I can say that you won't regret owning this drama...",1357689600,,641,4.297520661157025
