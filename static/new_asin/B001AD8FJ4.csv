8276834,4,B001AD8FJ4,"OK early-to-mid-60's West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace mystery.  A young woman inherits the contents of the title vault (no one knows what's in it) and a bunch of no-goods try to do her and each other out of it.  Not as spookily atmospheric as other entries in this genre.  The quality of the Sinister Cinema DVD-R is not bad.  Recommended.",1497744000,,353,4.833333333333333
