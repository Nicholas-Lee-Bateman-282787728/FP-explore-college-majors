1. The thing you need to know about surrealist cinema is that they are kind of anti-movies, because they refuse to follow a rational plot. Trying to make sense of them is usually an exercise in futility, because they mess with your brain, so they are only appreciated by certain types of people. This movie is one of the more famous of the genre.

2. This movie has more of a plot than many surrealist films. Its kind of about an epileptic boy named Aden who has seizures when he watches his repressive mom have rough sex. He grows up and kind of kills his mother, then escapes into the desert where he meets a magical man named Marvel. They spend time acting like camels and turning day into night. They go back to the city, and do more weird things.

3. It was directed by Fernando Arrabal, who was a member of the Panic Movement with people like Alejandro Jodorowsky (this movie feels a lot like a Jodorowsky film). One of his artistic goals was to use destruction to find beauty. This perspective is illustrated in the movie.

4. Like most surrealist films, it is full of random, bizarre scenes that sometimes pop on and off the screen so quickly that they're easy to miss.

5. There is a lot of religious iconography that is treated in ways that some people will consider blasphemous. I can't show you what happens next in this scene.

6. There is also a good amount of sexual imagery. In one scene, the mom lights Aden's penis like a candle. I'm not going to show you that scene, either. Here's a wedding scene, instead.

7. Its possible to find different interpretations of the film, but there is no correct way to view it.

8. Even 40 years later, some scenes are still considered pretty graphic and shocking

9. Some people love this movie. Some people detest it. Some are just mystified. But thats what surrealistic cinema is for - to shock you out of your regular reality.",1457136000,,1944,4.453521126760563

7977845,5,B00007L4O1,"This film is wonderful, very surreal and a little disjointed but never ever boring, far from it there are more surprise's and shocks in this then anything that's come out of Hollywood in the last 25 years . Think Jodorowsky, meets Monty python, with a pinch of Ken Russell , and your on the right track heading to oblivion but boy what a great ride. I won't go into the synopsis you can find that elsewhere but if avant garde surrealism is your bag then take a chance on this one, you won't be disappointed.",1393718400,,507,4.347368421052631
7977846,1,B00007L4O1,A disgusting film that isn't even respectable on an artistic level.  I feel gross having even watched it.  Don't even want to sell it.  Would rather just throw it into a plastic shredder.,1390435200,,187,4.606060606060606
7977847,4,B00007L4O1,"Nice movie,very entertaining but too much social criticism on the environmental exploitation.
Very watchable though with a lot of good laughs.
If you're an average human being,believing in god and other fakes,go buy a Robin Williams movie.
This is not for you!!!!",1296345600,,263,5.285714285714286

7977849,5,B00007L4O1,"I don't think this item has ever been released on video or been anyhow this available this way after it was exhibited, and I don't think It'll ever be again. Starring Emmanuelle Riva from Alain Resnais' "" Hiroshima My Love"", I consider this to be even better than the other DVD that's out there by Fernando Arrabal ( "" Viva la muerte""), even though I think his masterpiece is "" The three of Guernica"" and that the three of them use the same editing technique of flashback copiously. Call it pretentious, call it gratuitiously violent, call it discusting or whatever, these were the first works of its kind when they were made, and I have never seen anything like it. Fernando Arrabal is an influential artist that deserves attention, and this DVD, as well as the other, have gone beyond the call of duty of the release of these DVDs, which include invaluable interviews with the man himself. Great reflection on occidental culture schemes, specially those regarding religion, and great achievement of beauty through horror, humor and simultaneity.
