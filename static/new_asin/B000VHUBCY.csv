8218635,2,B000VHUBCY,"The intended application presumably includes an educational setting, but even unsophisticated younger students have trouble trusting the talk show format, the expert guests lack legitimacy.  First, they get presented as rags to riches stories, but even high school kids quickly determine that they are all actually upper middle class entrepreneurs who got greedy and foolish, and fell on hard times, using book sales and motivational speaking engagements to stage dramatic comebacks.  There is good solid personal finance advice in here, but the corny, melodramatic, staged, artificial live audience television talk show format makes the speakers appear to be charlatans, and the underlying message is mostly lost.  I'd say the first step to finding your inner millionaire would be to not waste your money on this DVD.",1236124800,,818,5.476190476190476
