Everything distant which for all its important moans and muffled cries, its ruined lives and millions of victims, that does not threaten to come rolling up to our threshold today we consider endurable and of tolerable dimensions.

Doris Kearns Goodwin and other historians, writer George Will, biographers' commentaries, diary and letter excerpts are interspersed with contemporary still and film records of Teddy FDR and Eleanor as they grapple with personal political and public conflict conscience and humane imperatives. Ken Burns crafts a linear story for each personality and interweaves it with the powerful drives of each of the others as they criss cross one another's paths through the decades, even in absentia after death.

The series sculpts portraits of Roosevelts as human beings with frailties insecurities suffering who balance their emotions with logic and restraint to deftly negotiate the troubled waters of family marriage American politics The Great Depression prejudice inequality and war.

The strained competition between the Hyde Park Roosevelts (FDR) and the Oyster Bay Roosevelts (Teddy and niece Eleanor), the strained marriage and impact of betrayal on Eleanor, the remarkably productive respectful intellectual partnership of Franklin and Eleanor, the physical demands of decision making, need for subtle nuanced maneuvering to protect Social Security from Congressional unbundling of the New Deal, CCC Civilian Conservation Corps, WPA Work Projects Administration and NYA National Youth Administration efforts as WWII spread through Europe North Africa and Asia, their resiliency despite personal bereavement, polio, public rejection are portrayed with swift storytelling careful editing and dramatic emphasis. Paul Giamatti voices Teddy's quotes, Edward Herrman FDR's, Meryl Streep Eleanor's.

Engrossing series throughout weaving public history with the personal struggles personalities human needs and limitations each brought to the service of a country in need of leadership hope and guidance.

Do something every day that you don't want to do; this is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain. Mark Twain

Eleanor recrafted Twain's advice as ""each day do one thing that scares you"" a motto for self discipline and productive function in the service of humanity.

5 stars seven part series, two hours each, outstanding",1411171200,6,3878,7.115303983228512
6371071,3,B00JKJ13EY,"Ken Burns has located and woven together a beautiful tapestry of irreplaceable photos and footage. He has again put together a quintessentially American documentary. However, he doesn't tell both sides of the story. The flaws in his heroes are papered over or pre-excused as lessons in human nature. Its essentially a panegyric to the Roosevelts. Consider Burns' take on FDR, which represents a big piece of the series. Strangely, Burns avoids Eleanor Roosevelt's kookiness, so entertainingly discussed in a recent New Yorker article based on recent biographies of FDR.  Given that much of the FDR portion of the series is about Eleanor and the relationship between the two of them it is odd that it wouldn't be mentioned, but I was hardly upset because really, and as Hillary Clinton famously said, ""What difference does it make?"" However, I was saddened by Burns' sanitized version of how six million Jews, and more than a million others, were allowed to die in the Holocaust. Missing from the story was that the millions died. I think that does make a difference. Somehow the Holocaust was no fault of FDR's - in Ken Burns' version of history FDR had been a bit of a hero for speaking out early against the Nazis' maltreatment of the Jews, and a wise leader for his anodyne position that Europe's Jews would best be saved by defeating the Nazis. Except that his strategy failed. FDR is also represented as having done everything an American President could do to get America into the war to help Britain, which bravely fought alone for two years while we sold them supplies. For cash on the barrelhead, until Britain's reserves were completely exhausted. In discussing why Roosevelt - a greatb leader - could not/would not lead America into war, America's reluctance to join Great Britain WW2 is equated with our reluctance to join Great Britain in WW1. It is true that Americans were isolationist before both wars, but there the similarity ends. WW1 was not fought against an evil empire. Germany did not threaten the world, it was engaged in a power struggle with France and England with whom we merely had a closer affinity.  Furthermore, Great Britain's situation in WW2 was utterly desperate and 50 old American destroyers and Lend Lease were never going to save it. Fortunately for FDR's historical reputation, the Japanese foolishly attacked Pearl Harbor and the Germans foolishly declared war on both the United States and the Soviet Union. Except for this perfect trifecta of stupidity, FDR might be remembered as the American President who allowed the triumph of a great evil and the destruction of his closest allies. Or perhaps with America desperate and isolated, FDR would have authorized that A-Bombs he was building be dropped on European cities, turning them into radioactive Dresdens. In summary, I enjoyed Burns' new series just as I have all his series and learned many interesting things about the Roosevelts. However,  I expect more criticality and balance in a biopic, which is what this essentially is.",1411084800,35,3029,4.982213438735178
6371072,5,B00JKJ13EY,The first 4 episodes of The Roosevelts: An Intimate History were the best historical documentaries I have ever seen. But the fifth episode was for me and my political point of view like a church service.,1411084800,2,203,4.666666666666667
6371073,5,B00JKJ13EY,"Ken Burns is at his spellbinding best again. Burns has definitely become our best director of historical documentaries. His works on the Civil War and baseball are probably his most well known work but there have been numerous others including his telling about the second world war, the Lewis and Clark expedition, the building of the Brooklyn Bridge and ..... Well I could go on and on but you get the point.

Now we are blessed with his latest contribution to American history ""The Roosevelts: An Intimate History"". This is an amazing look at one of the most important families of the 20th century. If the Kennedys dominated politics and Americans interests in their lives in the second half of the 20th century then the Roosevelts dominated Americans interests and politics in the first half of that same century. The documentary looks specifically at the lives of Teddy, Franklin and Eleanor. It covers their lives from birth to death and all the fascinating thing that would take place in their lives in between. It tells of their high and low points of their lives and doesn't pull any punches showing their faults and weaknesses as well as their successes. I could go into some detail what has been covered in their lives by Burns but you need to watch the series yourself and be surprised as I was in some of the things you will learn about the lives of these three important individuals. I am a bit of a history nerd and thought I knew a lot about all three of the Roosevelts. But the coverage here going into so many details that span from 1858 when Teddy was born to 1962 when Eleanor died is amazing. While indeed there was so much I did know about the three what I am learning while watching these programs shows just how little I really knew. Make no mistake. This is a complete looks at the lives of the Roosevelts and I will bet many of you are like me. You may think you know a lot about this family but you will be amazed too at what you will discover as you watch this compelling documentary.

The formula in this film is the same that Ken Burns has used in all his other documentaries. Famous actors speaking the words of the three Roosevelts from letters written and speeches given and personal conversations with some of Americas best historians, who have studied and written about the Roosevelts, adding commentary on the events that would occur in Teddy's, Franklin's and Eleanor's lives. There is no one today who can make history come alive while making it enjoyable to watch like Ken Burns can. You owe it to yourself to watch this series on one of the most influential families in the history of the United States!",1410998400,72,2643,4.5738396624472575
6371074,5,B00JKJ13EY,"I have thoroughly enjoyed ""The Roosevelts"" this week and look forward to tomorrow, Friday and Saturday.  The first biography I ever read was on Franklin, Theodore and Eleanor when I was in the fifth and sixth grades.  I read Eleanor's shortly before she died.  I read Franklin first because of my grandfather (maternal) always speaking so highly of him.  He died in office and everyone was so sad.  My interest in Theodore came from the fact the public high school for my neighborhood was named after him.  Eleanor naturally followed because she was married to one President and the niece of another!  Also, the fact she was still alive at that time!  To have two people who were sixth cousins to marry and reach the White House is something else.  Add to it the woman was the niece of another President.  That does not happen in most people's lifetime and I lived with a person that spanned all THREE of their lives!

When ""Eleanor and Franklin"" was released in 1972 I could hardly wait to read it because his relationships were discussed in it.  How it wounded Eleanor and it changed her and she became more independent!  I found out that Eleanor would go to Rock Creek Cemetery and sit on a young girl's gravesite and read.  This girl lived on 'N' Street NW, when they lived at 1733. The girl's father had a statue of the girl placed at her gravesite.  This young girl had committed suicide so Eleanor went there for the peace and tranquility she found there. That cemetery was also in my neighborhood!  It is a beautiful place to see especially in the spring!  ""Eleanor and Franklin"" was an excellent read.  I also got the sequel, ""Eleanor the Years Alone,"" I confess I have never gotten around to reading that one.

It is amazing to see how the information about their private lives just flows now.  When the subjects and their children are dead...it makes it easier to put the truth out there especially when it proves embarrassing because they may have lived outside of what is the social norm!  This is one thing I love about history...hearing and/or reading EVERYTHING!  Not just what you have always heard or read but the personal things.  The things that make them human and not ""gods"" or ""statues!""  I do not want to say any more about them because it will spoil it for you and that would not be right!

All of the books I have read on President Kennedy before Jacqueline died were so stiff and inhuman.  The books that have copyrights after 1994 are filled with so much more information I could hardly believe it.  President Kennedy became human to me and I found myself calling him ""Jack!""  That is how I feel about ""The Roosevelts!""  They are finally becoming HUMAN!  If you have not watched it you have really missed something spectacular!",1410998400,11,2755,4.597535934291581
6371075,5,B00JKJ13EY,"Ken Burns at his best telling the great story of this amazing family over an extensive period of time.  Many rocks were turned over and skeletons found in closets, yet it is done with respect for the impact these people had on our country.",1410912000,23,239,4.431818181818182
6371076,5,B00JKJ13EY,"If you are a fan of the Roosevelt family, American History, or Ken Burns, you will delight in this content-rich and picture-rich intimate history of the three most well-known and well-loved Roosevelts: Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor.  Interestingly, Ken Burns, the filmmaker of this documentary, is a distant relative of the Roosevelts.  This seven-part, and 14-hour, documentary spans mostly a century from Theodore's birth in 1858 to Eleanor's death in 1962.

First, however, you travel back in time to when the first Roosevelt, a Dutch immigrant, journeyed to Manhattan Island (New Amsterdam), and then you see glimpses of the Roosevelt ancestors in the 1800's as prosperous, successful and respected businessmen with their families.  Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor all had diverse childhoods, but you see how the family characteristics unite them: courage, ethics, and a desire to help those who weren't born a Roosevelt, or to families with means. Theodore, or Teddy, was Eleanor's uncle and, while President, gave her away in marriage to Franklin after leading the St. Patricks Day parade in New York City in 1905.  Franklin, a 5th cousin of Teddy's, was inspired by Teddy's example to aim for a life in politics and the White House.  Eleanor and Franklin both attended Teddy's inauguration as President.  Both men occupied the White House 19 of the first 45 years of the 20th century, and shaped the nature of the presidency.

The events of their lives, the spaces and homes which surrounded them, and the people close to them come alive in photos, in thoughts taken from their letters, and in quotes of others about them. You may be amazed to see photos of New York City in the late 1800's when there was still land on which to build large homes or the Natural History Museum. Manhattan looks a bit barren.  Photos of the desolate west,  which Teddy escaped to as a means of outrunning his grief at losing his young wife and mother on the same day in the same house, will also strike awe. Historians such as David McCullough, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Evan Thomas are among  the scholars who help to narrate this film. Actor Meryl Streep lends her voice to Eleanor Roosevelt in readings from personal letters and writings. Paul Giamatti speaks as Theodore, and Edward Herrmann gives voice to Franklin. ""The Roosevelts"" was written by Geoffrey C. Ward, an FDR Presidential library archivist and trustee.

Ken Burns recently confessed about this documentary on the Roosevelts: ""I don't know a film that has been more satisfying to me.""  In light of his other work, that comment speaks to this film's promise.  Audiences will be equally satisfied in viewing a century of American life through the lens and lives of these three unique and colorful, historical figures who were related as Roosevelts.",1410652800,167,2803,5.0

Not mentioned is that the race was financed by JP Morgan whose empire was being attacked by Taft's administration.  The 1912 convention was glossed over.  Not mentioned was the fact that TRs suppored tried to bribe Negro delegates to ditch Taft.  When it was apparent that this would not work Roosevelt walked out with his supporters to the 'Bull Moose' convention.  That is, his white supporters.  In order to win some Southern states, TRs strategy was to divide the southern white vote.  As a result, the Bull Mooe party did not allow any Negroes to attend the nominating convention nor have any leadership positions in Southern states.  Mr. Burns conveniently overlooks these facts to further his vierw of TR's legacy.  Not an honest approach for a spposedly honest film maker.",1468800000,,923,4.935064935064935

6371157,4,B00JKJ13EY,"Theres a LOT to like in this mammoth, 14 hour project, covering two of our greatest presidents and arguably our greatest 1st lady, as well as the revolutionary times they lived in.  As the NY Times sagely pointed out, the story goes from soldiers on horseback to the atomic bomb and beyond.  Done in Burns usual style, but leavened by lots of moving picture footage to mix in with the stills (the benefits of doing more recent history) the film does a great job of evoking the times these people lived in as well as their complex personal and family dynamics.

As always Burns gets terrific actors to read from the letters and writings of these historic figures, scoring a real coup in getting Meryl Streep as the voice of Eleanor  and Ms. Streep does her usual amazing job, getting not only Eleanors distinctive upper-class warble, but also her humanity and pain.  The wonderful Edward Hermann, who was so well known for playing FDR gives us one last go round in his signature role before leaving this world a sadder place for his departure.  And Paul Giammati  a spectacular actor but not who I would have though of for this  is flat out terrific as the voice of Teddy.

 Whats missing for me is caught in Burns title An Intimate History.  Personally, I wish it was MORE intimate.  Theres a certain genteel reticence in dealing with the emotional complexity of these great figures.  FDRs adultery isn't denied, but it isn't really explored either.  Nor is the nature of the doting female companionship he found in later years.  Completely ignored is Eleanors sexuality.  Not even mentioned in the film are the passionate love letters between her and journalist Lorena Hickok. Indeed Eleanor is given a bit of short shrift here in general.  At the end of the day, she was the figure I learned least about.  In some ways thats understandable, since there will always be more public record about a president than their spouse.  But I wish Burns had found a way to make Eleanor an equally well examined part of the triumvirate.  I cant help wondering if Burns desire to stay away from both speculation and the truly intimate had the unintended effect of also leading him away from Eleanor entirely.

Indeed, Burns' stated desire to stick only to established history leads to a number of crucial issues being overlooked.  For example, FDRs refusal to help Jewish refugees during WWII.  Was that a political decision?  A case of misplaced focus?  I understand that we cant be inside his head, but that doesnt mean we should just ignore such an important question.

But these criticisms aside, at the end of the day there is the same satisfaction one gets from finishing a long, in-depth history book  the sense that you have some real taste of a time, and of people now gone.",1462406400,,2771,4.695020746887967

Every one of FDR's socialistic machinations is accompanied with swelling, wonderful orchestral flourishes...the narrator overwhelmed with the greatness of his every edict.

TR established national parks, and an early battler of big corporations, who pushed the US to international presence. FDR of course saved millions of lives through the New Deal, Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, regulated the financial sector, and maneuvered through World War II. Eleanor Roosevelt is an inspiration to women everywhere as she was the first powerful and beloved ""first lady"", a true partner to FDR, and whose work extended to the UN and other causes after his death.  It is told with many fabulous pictures and films, thoroughly documenting each one of their rises to prominence, overcoming, in each case, incredible obstacles. Little known facts are revealed, all of which show what made each one of them tick. They and the Kennedys are by far the most influential family ever produced, and, like Lincoln or Washington, seemed to be just the statesmen - and stateswoman - that their times required, and they did not shrink from their calls to duty.

Incidentally I have over the past years purchased the Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR, and Teddy Roosevelt DVD.s Once again these three DVD's in my opinion were very interesting.

6371229,5,B00JKJ13EY,"This series is a masterpiece. I've always admired Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, but I definitely gained a new appreciation of Teddy, too, particularly the bold progressive reforms he pushed through, and the high cost he paid for going against his own party interests. Even some of the lesser known Roosevelts had extraordinary lives, and the documentary brings them into the interconnected stories that show the full depth and variety of the family legacy. The stories of these three titans of U.S. history impacted me profoundly by their extraordinary willpower, energy, and, most of all, unshakable commitment to doing what they felt was right in order to make the world a better place.
The film also includes an astonishing array of archival footage--photos, film, interviews--with the ordinary and not so ordinary people, events, and places that made up the breath-taking first half of the 20th century, and which directly took us to where we are today.
Watch this film before you cast your vote. Watch it to remind yourself of the things people fought so hard for us to have, and which we too often take for granted. Watch it and try, like I am trying, to be the kind of person in the kind of country Eleanor or Franklin or Teddy would have been proud to have worked so hard for.",1436313600,,1286,4.823529411764706
6371230,5,B00JKJ13EY,"The movie is in the normal Ken Burns style.  It has a mixture of photos, archival footage, and narration overlaying it all.  The movie makes the Roosevelts, in particular FDR look pretty wonderful.  Indeed, they were an excellent political family which led America through a very dark patch.

The movie is surprisingly uncritical of the FDR Administration's maneuvers to get American into WWII and leaves out the many Communist Spies and traitors, such as Henry Dexter White, who served on Roosevelt's staff.  The movie mentions Eleanor's support for anti-Communist refugees who fled the Soviet zone of occupation but it fails to mention that now, in the Clash of Civilizations the refugees themselves are a problem because the problems are within them.  Ask, for example, the good people of Minnesota exactly how they feel about Hmong and Somali ""enriching"" Minneapolis.  Eleanor Roosevelt did a great deal to make the UN a semi-pointless body whose primary focus is now to support Rent Seeking by dysfunctional nations.

However, while Eleanor should have recognized the coming disaster with regards to De-Colonization, such a thing was pretty arbitrary compared to the Red Army's cruel seizure of Eastern Europe and the menace of the Cold War.  Additionally, FDR's faults were exposed after his death, it is very likely if his health had continued to hold and he had one additional term as president, he could have done more to improve America's position in the Cold War.  The Roosevelts were keen sighted leaders after all.

All in all this was a very excellent film.  I found the FDR Memorial at the Mall far more meaningful after watching this film.",1436227200,,1655,5.044117647058823

This has to be the best I have ever watched, and I watch documentaries avidly as a College Professor. I never realized just how great these two men were, and most extraordinarily, how much greater than both Eleanor Roosevelt was in her campaigning for the downtrodden, and most particularly civil rights. I cheered in my living room as I heard of her championing of the rights of those who needed the government to help them the most, while reviling the weaknesses in moral character of these two great leaders and Presidents, for not taking a stand for ALL things that are right.

We need another President like Franklin to protect the social benefits we have, and fight tooth and nail for national health care in this country. We have been in an era of attacks against a liberal, caring government since Ronald Reagan took office and swept a Wall Street government in with him. And we need another strong person like Eleanor to stand up to the bigotry that Ronald Reagan brought in by the back door and Mitt Romney invited to dinner.

Thank you Ken Burns, for this documentary. I hope everyone in American sees this and considers the strength, caring courage of these three fine human beings.",1430697600,,1357,4.697478991596639

6371289,3,B00JKJ13EY,"The documentary was good, as most of Ken Burns' work is.  However, one thing spoiled it for me  --  Burns' apparently blatant racism as revealed by his treatment of blacks in ""The Roosevelts:  An Intimate History."".

Burns recounts Teddy Roosevelts' famous charge up San Juan Hill and the fact that he and his Rough Riders became entangled in barbed wire.  The narrator then goes on to say "" . . . Somehow, they managed to get free . . . "" or words to that effect.  WRONG!!  Roosevelt and his Rough Riders did NOT simply ""get free.""  The contingent of black troops that accompanied Roosevelt to Puerto Rico sacrificed their own lives to run out on the battlefield and cut the Rough Riders free of the barbed wire that entrapped them.  I am certain that Ken Burns is aware of this fact.  Considering the meticulous research that goes into producing his documentaries, he MUST be.  Besides, this is common knowledge.  Or, at least it was common knowledge back when I went to school.  Who knows WHAT they're teaching kids, nowadays.

At any rate, Teddy Roosevelt owed his life to the sacrifice of those courageous black soldiers, but Ken Burns didn't see fit to mention that.

The second incident of Burns' seeming racism occurred when he showed all of the Democratic presidents who have served in office following FDR.  Every Democratic president was shown, full face on, so that we could see them and recognize them, save one . . .  Barack Obama.  Burns showed only one photograph of Obama.  The shot was taken from the rear and it was in silhouette so that it was impossible to see Obama's face or recognize the fact that he is black.

These facts would seem to indicate that Burns is a racist, pure and simple.

After viewing ""The Roosevelts"" I will NEVER trust Ken Burns' work, again.  I am also distrustful of all of his past documentaries.  Who knows how Burns has attempted to alter history by deleting and ignoring pertinent facts about blacks in his documentaries?  This is nothing new.  It has been the case throughout the history of, not only America, but the entire world, that the contributions of whites are trumpeted to the heavens while those of people of color are ignored or relegated to the status of footnotes, if they are mentioned at all.

It's the Twenty-First Century and Ken Burns is one of the most influential historians of our time.  It is safe to say that students are using Burns' documentaries as research material, at present, and they will continue to do so in the future.  How sad that he is no different from historians of the past.",1427760000,2,2565,4.637777777777778

I believe the Roosevelts - Teddy, Elinore and Franklin - touched more lives in a positive way than any other family in American history; and as a history buff, I have long been interested in them and have read much about them...Edmund Morris' biographical trilogy of Teddy Roosevelt reinforced my view that Teddy was among the best of our presidents. Burns just further reinforces that view with his treatment of Teddy in this documentary. And FDR is almost universally acclaimed as the most influential president of the 20th Century - both in peace and war - and Burns' treatment of FDR again reinforces that fact. Elinore has always been a bit of a puzzle in my mind; but I certainly have a much better understanding and appreciation of her after seeing this documentary. In reference to the Hemingway quote above, it was used by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin to reference the hardships and handicaps each of the Roosevelts had to overcome to achieve greatness. Teddy was an asthmatic and sickly kid. Elinore had a mother who thought she was ugly and a father she dearly loved but who was an alcoholic. And of course, FDR, contracted polio at the age of 39, which crippled him for the rest of his life. As I was watching the segment on FDR it became clearer to me just how much he had to overcome and sacrifice to lead the nation through the Great Depression and the worst war we've ever fought in our history. In the end he sacrificed his life...when he was elected for his fourth term, it's the only time in our history I believe that the American public voted for a dying man for president. My highest recommendation!! -",1426377600,2,1964,4.630372492836676

I am somewhat of a history buff, and have studied about Theodore and FDR in the past, but this documentary did clarify some things, as well as just bring out interesting facts that I hadn't been aware of previously.

I knew that our daughter would also love it, and since she hadn't seen it, ordered this set for her for Christmas of 2014.

I have read several books about Theodore Roosevelt, and Doris Kerns Goodwin's brilliant biography of the relationship between Franklin and Eleanor.  However, I learned a great deal more about the three of them watching this brilliant series.  [We were out of the country during its airing on PBS, and didn't see it until my wife gave it to me for Christmas.]  I thought that I might lose interest in the final DVD, which covers FDR's last year, and then Eleanor's life after his death, but was amazed at the fantastic works that she did after he died.

6371430,5,B00JKJ13EY,"Fascinating historical account of an era that has seemed to offer very little drama beyond  the events of the times. Ken Burns brought to life those years by personalizing and bringing to life the main players,resurrecting them from history books into real people with challenges both emotional, political and physical. This easy to watch series provokes one to make comparisons with the present to question whether or not history is being repeated today, and if we've learned anything that will alter the future. Brilliant documentary.",1419984000,,536,5.305882352941176

Burns presents the Roosevelts as a dysfunctional yet dogged family when it came to pursuing what they were certain was the ""right"" path for America. Excellent voice overs by the actors and great historical archival material, expert editing. You are probably familiar with the Roosevelt stories, this series plumps them up with many interesting additions from their contemporaries and in their own words.

I very much appreciate the work Ken Burns has done in the past on his many projects with this being no exception.

Burns marries and coordinates still and movie photography with a superb narration crew and noteworthy writers, historians, and subjects' biographers for a comprehensive Roosevelt historic adventure.

I learned so much more about the eras of the Roosevelt's politically, socially and the history of their family.  Bringing all the elements into one biopic gave me a feeling that I could understand what was going on in our country and the emotions and thoughts behind the stories of Teddy, Eleanor and Franklin.  I have read a lot on Eleanor but never knew how amazing a man FDR was in our history.  My sympathies always lay with Eleanor in their marriage but I am seeing why he acted the way he did and how it fit into the placement of history.  I will definitely have to spend another 14 hours absorbing it all again!  Thank you Ken Burns and team.....",1418688000,2,731,4.41044776119403

It goes far beyond what any other documentary on TR or FDR has done and weaves in the stories of the families - From TR's father ""Greatheart"" and FDR's father ""Mr. James"" and his mother Sarah Delano, to the 6 children of TR and Eleanor's brother Eliot.  That level of ""intimacy"" is what makes this film special.

My only complaint is that it's a little biased toward FDR - it portrays the Oyster Bay Roosevelts in somewhat of a bad light after TR's death.",1417132800,2,607,4.490909090909091

6371538,5,B00JKJ13EY,"""The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Theodore Roosevelt

There are political dynasties, and then there are the Roosevelts of Hyde Park and Oyster Bay. All others are cheap imitations. The Bushes and the Roosevelts? It's like comparing apples and rotten mangoes. The Kennedy family, God bless 'em, doesn't even come close. The Roosevelts are the standard against which everyone who has come since are measured. The wannabes usually end up falling quite short.

The Roosevelts are the Beatles of American political families. That may sound like a trivialization of the most important and influential clan in the history of this country but, as anyone who knows me will tell you, that's about as high a compliment as I am able to make. It's next-to-impossible for me to describe my admiration for these people. No matter how hard I try, I still end up understating how great a debt we owe to these decent, troubled, great and greatly  flawed  human beings. The scope of their mountaintop highs and deep-valley lows is a human drama that leaves even the most casual observer of history utterly mesmerized. This is a story wrought with tragedy - and enough screwball comedy to keep the laughs flowing. I've been reminded of this for the last three evenings watching Ken Burns' new documentary series, ""The Roosevelts: An Intimate History"". I'll be reminded again tonight, and every night till Saturday when the series concludes.

For twenty-five years Ken Burns has been cranking out one historical series after another, and every one of them have been brilliant. He is in the process of working on several yet-to-be-released projects. One of them, a two-part documentary on Ernest Hemingway, won't be ready until the year 2020. I'm now at a point in my life where I can say, without a trace of self-consciousness, that I really do hope I live to see it. I'm definitely glad I lived to see The Roosevelts. It's the best one he's done thus far - and that's saying a lot!

I can't tell you who won the 1932 world series for the simple reason that, eighty-two years later, it doesn't make a damned bit of difference to our lives who won it. I can tell you who won the presidential election that year, though. Four score and two years after the fact that does make a difference. Think about this: On the evening of February 15, 1933, less than a month before entering the White House, a would-be assassin named Giuseppe Zangara attempted to murder Franklin D. Roosevelt in Miami, Florida. The bullet, instead, hit Chicago mayor, Anton Cermak, who died nineteen days later. Had FDR been assassinated on the eve of his inauguration the presidency would have gone to his running mate, a not-too-visionary bigot from Texas named John Nance Garner. If Zangara's bullet had not missed its mark on that night, the entire history of the world - not merely the United States - would have been much different. ""What if...."" It makes the imagination tremble.

 ""I should like to have it said of my first administration that in it, the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. I should like to have it said of my second administration that in it, these forces met their master.""

Franklin Delano Roosevelt

To his own kind, FDR was a traitor to his class, or, ""That man in the White House"". He was not merely the most liberal president in the history of the republic, he was a radical - at a perilous moment when radical change was needed; not unlike it's needed at present.

If you appreciate the millions of acres of national parkland and animal sanctuaries set aside for posterity; if you're grateful for the Social Security check that you or a loved one receives each month; if you've benefited from one the of thousands of high schools, post offices, tunnels or bridges built in the nineteen thirties; if you have ever fallen on hard times and were forced to receive much-needed cash from the feds because you became unemployed; if you were a vet and the GI Bill of Rights afforded you a college education - in short, if during the years after the Second World War, you were able to live comfortably as a member of the middle class - thank a Roosevelt. What I just rattled off for you was the (very) short list. I have neither the time nor space to mention them all. This country owes so much to this family that it's impossible to catalog the debt. Sadly, most American are oblivious to it all.

The series begins at Theodore's birth on October 27, 1858 and fades to black with the death of Eleanor on November 6, 1962. The 104 years and 10 days between those two dates comprise a saga that only could have happened in this country. Of particular note is the gut-wrenching story of Eleanor's upbringing. Abandoned by her adored father, scorned by her mother who was ashamed of the child's rather plain looks, she was an orphan by the age of ten; raised in a house run by a cheerless grandmother and two mentally unbalanced uncles. Anyone else might have succumbed to fate's cruelties at so young an age. Her already fragile emotional constitution would be shattered further in 1918, fourteen years into their marriage, when she discovered that Franklin was having an affair. That she was able to overcome so much and become one of the most significant persons of the American Century is as much a testament to her inner fortitude as anything.

While still young men, Theodore and Franklin were dealt incapacitating, personal blows that forever changed them. For Theodore it was Valentine's Day 1884 when his wife and mother died on the same day in the same house. In Franklin's case it was in the late summer of 1921 when he was stricken with infantile paralysis, never to walk again. Both men thought that their lives were over. The trumpets were yet to summon them to greatness.

""Black care"", wrote Theodore Roosevelt, ""rarely sits behind a rider whose pace is fast enough.""

It's fifty-two years since the last survivor breathed her last breath. We are greatly diminished as a nation because they no longer walk among us. It almost takes away the fear of dying, you know?

Little did we know of the difficulties each overcame  in order to give their best to this nation and the world.

FDR's New Deal, supported by Eleanor provided work for members of my family and for my husband's family.  My mother found work with the WPA, her male cousins planted trees and built parks.  The money they sent home helped their widowed mother with her nine sons buy staples while they grew or hunted the rest of their food.  My husband's oldest brother's $25 a month sent home fed a family of six in a drought devastated county.  When I was a child, Teddy Roosevelt's cabin was brought to Bismarck to be displayed on the grounds of the state capitol, and I used to play in it, so I felt close to him.  It has since been returned to the ND Badlands where it can be viewed.

To many Franklin Roosevelt is/was the greatest President ever.  You definitely have to tip your hat to anyone who overcomes physical malady and rises above to become more than seemingly capable.  This may be the reason the authors gloss over some of his deviousness as president.  It is mentioned, but I do not recall any examples given.

6371599,5,B00JKJ13EY,"There have been so many documentaries on the three Roosevelts -  Theodore, Franklin, and Eleanor - that when Ken Burns' documentary was announced I wondered what more could be said.  Well, there's plenty to see in this sprawling 14 hour work, including many previously unseen photographs and moving pictures.  A thread of tragedy runs through the saga.

After a brief recounting of the first Roosevelts in America (Nicholas Roosevelt, the last common ancestor to the three ""great"" Roosevelts, died in 1742) the story picks up in 1858 with the birth of young Theodore.  Teddy, of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts, was an asthmatic, sickly boy who willed himself into vigorous action - both physical and mental.  He also was susceptible to depression, and tried to conquer despair by outrunning it.  But negative feelings catch up with one, and there was a streak of rage that ran through the man, sometimes resulting in explosions of temper - as when he shot a dog that barked at him.  In the course of one day when Theodore was 25, his daughter Alice was born, and his wife and mother both died.  Theodore left the daughter in the care of his sister and fled to the west to conquer his grief.  When ""rancher Ted"" returned it was a quick rise up the political ladder until he became President after William McKinley was assassinated.  As President, TR was at his best when he was able to channel his zeal into constructive action, like reforming the food industry, busting trusts, and preserving America's natural heritage. But in many ways he was, to coin a phrase, a ""bully""- who thought nothing of invading other nations, and betraying William Howard Taft (who did more the continue his predecessor's policies than he's given credit for).

Franklin, of the Hyde Park Roosevelts, born when Theodore was 23, was a lonely boy: tutored at home, with only a small circle of friends who were all from the same social class as he.  Young Franklin spent most of his childhood in the presence of adults, always wanting to please and never annoy them (particularly his father, whose health had been fragile from the time he suffered a heart attack when Franklin was eight).  FDR grew up in his distant cousin's shadow.  He admired and emulated TR to the point where, when he learned he needed glasses, he ordered ""pince-nez"" spectacles, and he was fond of using TR's patented terms ""bully"" and ""dee-lighted"" - and then there was his decision to marry Theodore's favorite niece, Eleanor.  He emulated TR's rise up the political ladder, where he struck many as capable but superficial.

If there was ever a member of the Roosevelt clan who was shaped by personal tragedy, it was Eleanor.  She was born in 1884 - the same year as Theodore's daughter Alice.  Eleanor's mother was a cold woman who died prematurely, her father (Teddy's brother) was a severe alcoholic and unstable even when sober.  By the time Eleanor was ten, both her parents and one of her brothers had died.  She never knew parental love.  It wasn't until she went to a finishing school in England that she gained a sense of self-confidence and a conscience to help other people - to be loved by  being useful.  It was her depth that attracted Franklin to her - beyond her famous uncle.

Franklin and Eleanor's complex marriage is discussed without being dissected.  Franklin's relationship with Lucy Mercer is examined from a psychological, rather than a salacious point of view.  After Eleanor learned of Franklin's affair with Lucy, they led increasingly separate lives in a partnership that was more than merely political, yet less than a conventional marriage.  Eleanor's lesbian friends are mentioned, but it is left to the viewer to decide if Eleanor ever returned their affections.  Eleanor doesn't seem to have felt threatened by Missy LeHand's increasing role in Franklin's life, and Franklin was friendly with Eleanor's companions, both male and female.  The marriage was largely Laissez-faire relationship, but when the going got rough, as when Franklin was diagnosed with polio, the inner strength of their bond was proved.

Various members of the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park branches of the Roosevelt family pop-up from time to time - in particular FDR's mother Sara, and Theodore's daughter Alice. It's ironic that Theodore's family became so bitterly resentful of Franklin and Eleanor.  Franklin essentially carried out much of Theodore's 1912 Bull Moose platform, and I wonder if the Oyster Bay branch's opposition to Franklin was based more on a clash of egos than philosophy - or perhaps they never grasped that FDR and TR basically stood for the same things: a social safety net, shared prosperity, and the projection of American power.  (Indeed, one wonders what Theodore would have thought of Alice's 1940 remark that she'd ""rather vote for Hitler than vote for Franklin"".)  Chronologically, the story ends in 1962 with the death of Eleanor Roosevelt, who had become known as ""First Lady of the World"" and the conscience of the Democratic party.

What really astonished me in this documentary is the large amount of previously unseen (by me, anyway) footage. I had no idea there was film of the assassination attempt against FDR - but here it is. There are also a few frames of FDR throwing his arms around his son's and another person's shoulders as they lowered him to his wheelchair at the 4th inaugural - and the home movies that are included as a bonus feature. Almost 70 years after his death, and there are still new discoveries.

I had a mixed reaction to the voiceovers provided by Paul Giamatti (Theodore), Edward Herrmann (Franklin) and Meryl Streep (Eleanor).  Giamatti's voiceover for TR sounds the same as his John Adams portrayal and doesn't sound anything like Teddy's voice, for which recordings exist.  On the other hand, if Teddy's squeaky voice had been accurately recreated, it would probably have been unintentionally funny.  Peter Coyote's measured narration won't be to everyone's taste.

For all the depth of the production, there were items that were missing.  No mention of the Newport Scandal, which almost sank FDR's career.  Nor any mention of FDR's uneasy relationship with Joseph Kennedy, who helped FDR secure the 1932 Democratic nomination, but later blamed ""that crippled sonuvabitch"" for the death of his oldest son during the war.  Little mention is made of what became of various Roosevelt family members, including Alice Roosevelt Longworth and Franklin and Eleanor's children, after Eleanor's death.

The DVD contains a number of special features, including deleted scenes, a making of feature, and a segment with Geoffrey Ward discussing Daisy Suckley - whose diaries and correspondence were discovered in the 1990s and shed new light on FDR.  The Roosevelts may be 14 hours long, but is mandatory viewing for those interested in learning more about one of America's most influential families.",1411430400,51,6904,4.986038394415358

Defeating his polio, Great Depression and WW II, he paved future in a great way.

Has his New Order instilled aspirations into young minds of our generation?
Has his dream been fulfilled by guiding America to be the greatest nation?
Has our society progressed with equality and human rights with toleration?

Wicked fires littered all over the land shed no light, eyes not see, ears not hear.
Celebrities worshiped as household gods pollute souls and minds being unclear.
Branding, marketing and consumerism exploit dreams with deceitful smear.

Putin's tests in Crimea, ISIS's challenge in Syria, Al-Qaida and Taliban's resurgence,
CIA operatives and ambassador's murder, journalists' being beheaded occurrence,
America is leading from behind with ever declining international influence.

Human trafficking, opposition massacre, assault on women, prisoners' torture,
Religious suppression, freedom repression, basic right violation of horrific nature,
Civilization is marching on along a creepy path without cultivated nurture.

By renewed order, young minds are to aspire to go above and beyond the call of duty.
By rekindled dream, America's democracy ought to lead the divided  world in unity.

It goes beyond the events portrayed and gives us insight into the character, triumphs, and tribulations of Theodore, Franklin and Eleanor.

They each had a tremendous desire to better the human condition, and pushed themselves to accomplish great things.

8651766,3,B00JKJ13EY,"Like much of Ken Burn's work, ""The Roosevelts"" is heavy on emotionality, heavy on narrative arc, and heavy on cinematic appeal. But when it comes to analysis, when it comes to exposing the ideological fault lines in his subject matter, when it comes to airing disagreements over historical matters of fact or value--well, Burns is as light as a twitter feed.

Burns loves to tell a story, but in the end, his centrist view of politics produces a story that is little more than a safe updating of Norman Rockwell's America.  Was Teddy Roosevelt really a ""great President,"" or more of a frustrated imperialist? Aside from his conservation efforts, was Roosevelt's progressivism real or mostly grandiose self-promotiion?  Did Roosevelt's crusading masculinity make an overall positive or negative contribution to American foreign policy?  We never hear these kinds of questions asked, historians on both sides of these questions are never given a chance to disagree, because that would interrupt the hagiographic flow of what Burns is trying to do.

The distortions show up in the FDR section as well. Is George Will really the right person to introduce the New Deal by saying, ""the best of the New Deal programs was Roosevelt's smile?"" Followed by this narration: ""Franklin Roosevelt was essentially a lonely man..."" What do these things have to do with the New Deal? The New Deal was not a smiley face, the New Deal wasn't orchestrated by a recluse--the New Deal was a battleground between those who resisted government intervention into the economy and those who embraced that idea. Of course FDR is on record as not having ""an ideology."" And yet, why then does he have so many ideological opponents? ""FDR believed, like Teddy believed, that the Presidency was preeminently a place of moral leadership?"" Huh? Where's the evidence for that? Then George Will again: ""Building on the work of the first Roosevelt, the second Roosevelt gave us the idea, the shimmering, glittering idea of the heroic Presidency, and with it, the hope that complex problems would yield to charisma."" Really? Charisma is the hope of the New Deal, George?

The point is, Burns is so determined not to offend anyone, he ends up presenting a highly sanitized version of American history, all the rough edges sanded off, particularly on topics that continue to preoccupy our politics: how much intervention in the economy, how much aggression in our foreign policy, how much power to Wall Street, and so forth. These are highly contentious, live topics in American life, but Burn's goal seems to be to make history irrelevant to these ongoing conversations.

This problem plagues practically all of Burns' documentaries, and in general I think of him as a 2-star filmmaker. He gets a third star on ""The Roosevelts"" because of the amazing archival footage on FDR's work at Warm Springs, Georgia--images I've never seen before and that I found incredibly moving....",1523750400,,2935,5.051652892561983
