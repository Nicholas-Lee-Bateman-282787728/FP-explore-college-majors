8701176,1,B00TB0BV58,"Purchased this movie and we found it lacking in action. They made the Trailer looking like it's and action packed movie, IT ISN'T. The only real action is at the end, and that is short and sweet. Little bit activity about half way through, other than that, boring.
If you want to watch, rent it first!",1429660800,,301,4.392857142857143
