4131343,4,B003JQZXXQ,A college freshman suspects there is something sinister about the prestigious sorority to which she decided to pledge. She comes to find out that there is a mystery surrounding the disappearance of a pledge from the previous year. Too many questions and strange happenings add quite a twist to this tale.,1390867200,,304,4.980392156862745
4131344,4,B003JQZXXQ,"I was not expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. The storyline was original; I have never seen anything like this in another film and in my opinion, the plot deserves a 9 out of 10. It is NOT a typical haunting film, it's actually much better. However, I need to deduct a point for some of the actors, deduct a point for production, half a point for pace and half a point for the quickie climax at the end. So my overall mark is seven, but if they had changed the ending slightly, made the duration of the film more intense, had more money to cast better actors and incorporate better effects, then this would have been a nine, maybe ten. And also the title is very poor.",1373414400,,679,4.151515151515151

4131346,4,B003JQZXXQ,"I liked it well enough for a tv movie (there is not any sex, nudity, gore or torture).  The acting was standard for the most part and the plot was predictable and nothing new but it was a descent watch for a lazy weekend.  A girl moves into a sortiy house and eventually members end up disappering a few days before initiation.  The sority members clearly have an inkling as to what is going on but they are unwilling to share the secret.  It is up to Samantha and her ex-boyfriend (who happens to be interested in all things metaphysical) to uncover the mystery and save the day.",1299456000,5,580,4.342592592592593
4131347,4,B003JQZXXQ,"If you are looking for a creepy storyline without any blood/gore, nudity, or sex, then this is your thing. In many ways this movie is similar to the ""Sorority Row"" film released to theaters, as it features a ghostly presence of a sorority sister who died during pledge week a year earlier. As the story develops, it focuses on Samantha (played by Leighton Meester), who is adjusting to life as a pledge and life as a college student in general. The plot is really no surprise to anyone; soon after the ghostly presence reveals itself, odd things begin to happen to the girls responsible for the tragic accident.

Again, if you are looking for a film with a good scary plot that does not have the cursing, blood & guts, etc. that most all slasher films do, then this would be perfect for you. But don't confuse this with the version in theaters. That film is full of R-rated material, and although both stories achieve their goal in the end, I'd give the edge to this one, because with all the partying and extracurricular stuff cut out, the story actually is easier to follow. And Meester does a fine job, giving a balanced performance between a strong young woman and a scared college girl.",1296345600,9,1191,4.565420560747664
