1204006,5,B00000F8KW,"This is one of the best new dramas to come along in a long time. I loved Patrick Swayze in this. I think he was typecast from Dirty Dancing, and this is an entirely different type of role. He pulled it off fantastically. Sadly the series was cancelled before a second season, and I suspected it might be due to his losing his battle with cancer. Today, we got the news, he has died. He'll be missed. If you want to see his last, and probably best work, this is the one to get. I wish they would continue the series with the other character taking the lead. The storyline actually would be well suited to that.",1252886400,4,609,4.213675213675214
1204007,5,B00000F8KW,"This is another side of Patrick Swayze that continues to show what an AWESOME, multi-faceted actor he is!  The Beast was, and still is, one of the best television series to hit the screen and I am SO disappointed they cancelled it.  Excellent from Episode 1 to Episode 13, The Beast is suspenseful and action packed...very intense!  I would like to commend Travis Fimmel for his excellent portrayal of Ellis Dove....the little-bit quirky, but loyal to the end, side-kick of Charles Barker...great acting, I hope they put him in another series SOON!!

The only complaint I have of this DVD collection is WHY IN THE WORLD DIDN'T THEY INCLUDE ENGLISH SUBTITLES...it would ahve helped me tremendously!",1250985600,6,697,4.982758620689655
1204008,4,B00000F8KW,"It wasn't long ago that the world was made aware of Patrick Swayze's battle with cancer. Once made public, everyone speculated that he would never act again. Thank goodness someone had the decency to side up with Swayze and give him the chance with the TV show THE BEAST.

Swayze stars as FBI undercover agent Charles Barker. Barker is an agent who gets the job done no matter what it takes. If the rules need bent a little then so be it. But the scum of the Earth are the villains he tracks down and Barker makes no bones about the way he thinks they should be handled.

As the series begins we are also introduced to Ellis Dove (Travis Fimmell), a young agent just starting out in the undercover world. Ellis is being trained by Barker and Barker doesn't go easy on him. Within minutes of the shows start, he actually shoots him in the chest...twice! Sure, he's wearing a Kevlar vest but it can't feel good. Truth be told, Ellis was about to blow his cover which would have resulted in his death. The 2 shots may have hurt but in the long run they saved his life and provided a needed lesson.

The difference between the two men is obvious. Where Barker is world weary and battle scarred, a man who knows his way around the technicalities of the law and who knows how to get his man, Ellis is fresh and new. It shows in his actions and the way he looks at the job. Its showdown time with each new assignment and he's ready for action. But that attitude can get you killed rather than the job done. It will take Barker to reign in Ellis and train him so that he doesn't get himself or his partner killed.

The initial episode finds the pair searching for missiles on American soil. But it's not just the missiles that they want. They want the man behind it all, the one buying the missiles so they can take him off the street and put him away. Each clue leads them to this man but it isn't until the show's end he is captured.

But it doesn't end there. On his way home, Ellis is met on the subway by several of the suspects he met along the way on this mission, one of which he even smoked crack with to form his cover. It turns out these are another set of FBI agents and they have an ulterior motive for approaching Ellis. It seems that Barker may have gone too far and might be involved in doing more harm than good. This group wants Ellis to go undercover as an undercover agent to get the goods on Barker.

With each subsequent episode, Ellis deals with the idea that maybe Barker isn't all right. That maybe he is what they say. And each episode presents him with proof provided by this group to make him see their way. This does nothing more than create a world of deceit and stress for Ellis as he tries to decide the right thing to do.

But then again are these agents really doing what they claim? Or is there something else behind their motives when it comes to Barker? Who can trust whom here? The answers won't be easy and won't come too fast. Hey, if they did what kind of show would that leave you?

Swayze does a fine job portraying the grizzled old vet who's teaching the new kid the ropes. Where he once starred as the fresh faced romantic lead, he's taken on a leaner meaner look, no doubt brought on by his problems in the real world. But it works and helps him cement the feel of the character.

Fimmell matches Swayze scene for scene, coming off as the fresh faced rookie who is just getting the hang of things. Toss in some personal problems for them both and the show builds the depth required to make these characters ones we can feel for.

Rather than make a prolonged sting operation as real life would hand them (some agents go undercover for months at a time, some years), the show presents us with a different situation each week. Be it kidnapping or weapons dealing, these agents are out to protect the world at all costs.

The show offers the correct blend of drama and action, suspense and intrigue. It keeps your interest from beginning to end. It's another example of the benefits of being able to watch a series on DVD, starting and stopping when you need, never missing an episode and getting the chance to see that great show you missed because two good ones were on at the same time. THE BEAST is worth watching.",1250553600,33,4253,4.30375
1204009,5,B00000F8KW,"This show was soooo good!  It was exciting!  Each week I was so wrapped up in what was going on, I didn't even realize the time, it went by so fast.  I couldn't wait for the next episode.  I'm really sad the show won't be returning.  It leaves so many questions unanswered.  If you don't mind only one season and enjoy action and very interesting plots, you should buy this!  I wish Patrick all the love in the world and pray for a miracle.  I do hope to see Travis Fimmel in other shows or movies!",1249689600,10,498,4.114583333333333
1204010,4,B00000F8KW,"Overall this show 'wowed' me a lot more then I ever thought it would, though I was never sold on the title they chose.  Surprisingly good, despite some new comers and a gritty underbelly.  I believe this is the last work Patrick Swayze did, before his death from cancer, September 14, 2009.
Mr. Swayze made his acting debut in the 1983 movie 'The Outsiders' directed by Francis Ford Coppola, which also starred several other beginners, including Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Diane Lane, and Matt Dillon among others.  For those interested in more about Mr. Swayze, his book is coming out September 29, 2009, aptly titled 'The Time of My Life'.
The show, Season 1, which contains thirteen episodes, originally aired on January 15, 2009, on the A&E Channel, is about a veteran FBI agent (Swayze) who gets a new partner (Travis Fimmel), and is not too excited about it.  The new 'wet behind the ears' partner soon learns that his veteran partner is probably working on both sides of the fence (legal and illegal) and has to decide what to do when he gets approached to spy and rat on him (Swayze).
Great story, great troubled characters, some incredible action scenes, smart and fun dialogue, nice set design.  I was truly amazed on how good it was.
Unfortunately, there is only one season.  The show got canceled due to concerns about Mr. Swayze's health issues (pancreatic cancer).  It's a loss to those of us that came to love the series.
Update:
While I didn't like that they canceled show, because I loved it so much, I'm glad they did now, so Mr. Swayze could have that time with family and friends before he passed on.  I feel like this series was some of his best work.",1247788800,35,1683,4.624161073825503
1204011,5,B00000F8KW,"The Beast was an excellent show. It was colorful, salty, adventurous. Excellent, fully committed acting all around.

1204013,4,B00000F8KW,"I don't have TV, but I travel enough for work that I caught three episodes in a row of this show in hotel rooms. I had missed the pilot, but was hooked enough on the show to want to see it. A&E has some of the episodes online, but they have commercials, and there is the occasional lag. This video from Amazon was virtually lag-free (literally, once I had downloaded the full episode), but I noticed the colors were a little oversaturated for the middle of the video (to the point that the background looked almost cartoony in brighter scenes) but the people were still clearly visible. It's not perfect, but it's better than trying to stream videos with irritating malfunctioning ads, and it's still cheaper than having TV.",1241740800,,724,4.62015503875969

1204224,1,B00000F8KW,I can't put my finger on exactly why I hated the show.  Perhaps it was because they were trying too hard to convince you that Swayze's character was so bad ass and jaded.  I'm not even sure where they were going with Fimmel's character.  I just know I hated the one I forced myself to finish watching.,1486080000,2,301,4.245614035087719

I don't know the right wording for it - but it hurts my eyes sometimes - the action doesn't seem to flow smoothly - almost like transition issues having the film burnt to dvd.",1485475200,,488,3.989795918367347

Had he not died, it would be interesting to see the direction the series would take. It was very jarring to see Patrick in a role which really tasked his depth as an actor, rather than the face roles he had played in the past. This is gritty and intense. Totally an opposite from expectation. And he carried it well. Evoking the viewers emotional involvement, I wondered if I should like him or hate him or excuse him. I still don't know.

I also admired the development of Travis Fimmel's hip and spirited character.  IMHO, Travis could carry the show, were the producers to revive it forward.

1204815,5,B00000F8KW,"Such a powerful story with no punches pulled. Patrick Swayze finishes his career on a high note. Actually filmed on location, he never let his illness get in the way of performing an outstanding role and creating a character who would do what he had to do.  I think you may be cheering him on when he uses his unorthodox methods to take down the 'bad guys'.  Think of the show, ""Leverage' on steroids.",1354233600,3,401,4.405405405405405

1204820,5,B00000F8KW,"I was the director of photography on this project. We knew that Patrick was very ill but I learned a great deal about the man and his wife during production. He refused to let anyone else do his stunts, was always incredibly kind and generous to fans. I recall one night in Chicago a car load drove by and shouted, ""we love you, Patrick"". With that great sense of humor he shouted back, ""I'm not dead yet!"" He and the entire company laughed long and hard. Looking at this project and realizing that he knew this was his last piece of work gives a greater depth to the character he played and to the honor and professionalism of the man. I highly recommend it.",1341878400,42,659,4.32258064516129
1204821,5,B00000F8KW,"This is a terrific and entertaining show that is presented wonderfully in dvd. There is not a lot of bonus material with Patrick Swayze for obvious reasons. His work on this remains like all his previous work- perfect. He was an incredible actor and it amazes me that he worked on this series while he battled pancreatic cancer. The show's characters and sub-plots are interesting while also keeping in line with the central story arc of the season: is he a rogue FBI agent or not? This is a great story and Swayze should've earned some awards or at least some nominations for his role as the troubled FBI agent. There are many labels one could attach to his character, but he was, unfortunately, not allowed enough time to evolve. Like the actor who portrayed him, he was gone too soon... An added bonus is to see Lou Diamond Phillips star in an episode with Swayze.",1322265600,9,867,4.564102564102564

Patrick Swayze plays an FBI agent who doesn't exactly play by the book, but always in a way you can't argue with.  His motives always seem true and honest, and right.  Truly love this series.

1204914,4,B00000F8KW,"I agree with most other reviews that this is some of Swayze's best work.  This is an all around good show..good writing, awesome camera work and lighting (love the high contrast desaturated pallete), and great acting........up until the last episode.  The characters are all interesting, multi-dimensional, and you never know who is on what ""side"" or if there even is a ""side"" or just differing personal agendas.  However, everything falls apart in the last episode.

I wish they would have just ended the series at the ""to be continued"" mark on the second to last show.  The last episode is just really poor quality.  The script on the last episode is nonsensical and the entire episode feels rushed and feels like they patched together a bunch of scenes they filmed with different endings in mind.  The whole plotline with the ""girl"" makes little sense and the set up for the final reveal is poorly executed and entirely predictable.  Scenes are inconsistent with each other and do not ""flow.""  The acting is also relatively poor on the last episode, as well as the camera work and audio....it looks like a series of screen tests and rought takes with little post-production work other than adding the show's soundtrack to certain spots.  Background street audio is audible where it otherwise would not be.  Actors seems to be reciting ""stock"" lines with little or no emotion.....  At certain points you wonder if you are really watching ""behind the scenes"" footage rather than a polished final product.  Given the quality of the other episodes, the last one was a let down.

That said, this is one of those shows where if you have some free time, you will find yourself watching ""just one more"" episode.  The show pulls you in and keeps you on the edge and guessing.  Overall great product.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the last episode.",1304467200,,1844,4.784810126582278

1204955,5,B00000F8KW,"I was always just a so-so fan of Patrick Swayze prior to this series and his unfortunate passing. But this show really impressed me and after watching it I was very sad to realize he has left us and this will be his final work.

The show starts off a little slow following two undercover FBI Agents with questionable ethics and it takes a few episodes to develop a rooting interest for them. But after about the 6th show the series really picks up and this series started to take on the best elements of ""The Shield"" another awesome cop show. The two Agents are fearless, lethal, and completely dettached from the 'real world' in order to do their jobs and that's what makes them so compelling to watch.

At the end of the show when you've really formed an attachment to the characters you realize the show is not only not on anymore, but the driving force behind it in Patrick Swayze, is no longer with us. That being the case, this is wonderful 'farewell performance' for PS and the show is well worth having in your collection.",1258761600,3,1030,4.444444444444445

1204962,5,B00000F8KW,"""The Beast"" was an extraordinary series. Patrick Swayze as FBI Agent, Charles Barker, put his heart and soul into his role  and in the process he stole all of our hearts with his gritty portrayal of Agent Barker, who always got the job done battling the scum of the earth HIS WAY, while battling an aggressive cancer in his real life. Travis Fimmel, as Barker's partner, Ellis Dove, gave a supreme performance as the rookie who had a rough road ahead working for the unpredictable Barker. The chemistry between Swayze and Fimmel was amazing and  it was such a truly believable series that I totally got caught up in it, eagerly waiting for the next episode. While bringing ""The Beast"" back is not likely, I feel it would be a fine tribute to Patrick Swayze who died on September 14th. He had been quoted as saying that ""this was a role of a lifetime"" for him and although Agent Charles Barker could never be replaced, the show could continue with the talented Travis Fimmel and other cast members. This DVD is a must for all Patrick Swayze and Travis Fimmel fans.",1252972800,2,1063,4.560209424083769

7907149,5,B00000F8KW,"According to the other reviews, and the DVD cover, this is all about Patrick Swayze and his final performance.  And yes, he is good, although I'm not sure the role requires a lot more than taut anger and determination, with dollops of rage - what you see on the cover is what you get.  He certainly does exceedingly well for a man fighting such a terrible battle with disease.

I remembered the series from when it screened on TV back around 2009 and but I was moved to go back for another look because of Travis Fimmel. This is Fimmel before Ragnar Lothbrok, but it's all there: the twitchy smile, the charm, the blue-eyed charisma.  It may seem like blasphemy to say so in this context, but I think he actually carries this series - he certainly seems to get the lion's share of screen-time.  His scenes with FBI agent Todd Jaracki (Johnny Kastl) were a highlight - the straight-laced desk man being seduced into providing technical insider assistance under the onslaught of Fimmel's masculine charm and the glamour of dangerous field work.  That nerd is us, willing hand over all the protected information we can dig out to bask in that reflected sunshine.  Kevin O'Connor, Pamela Reed and Lawrence Gilliard Jr also impressive.

The series manages to avoid some of the boilerplate tropes of US police dramas, of which we are all well tired.  There was only one Deus-ex-machina moment that stuck out like a pig in a tree, conveniently not witnessed by anybody. It sure looked like a point that could redound to bite somebody in the proverbial.  Maybe they hoped to do this in a next series that never happened?",1520467200,,1612,4.6643109540636045

7907152,5,B00000F8KW,"I purchased and watched this series after Patrick Swayze had died.  Knowing he was battling a terrible cancer while filming this made me appreciate all the more what a terrific job he did playing Charles Barker.  He looked and acted as rough and tough as he always did in his other action movies. This was his last film effort, sadly, but he sure went out on a high note.  He is missed, and he was loved for all the excitement, and romance he gave to his audiences over the course of his career.  And he is remembered for his warrior like courage in battling cancer.  What  an inspiration, what an example, and what a loss for all of us.  All that being said, the series was a good one.  Travis Fimmel was a good choice for co-star.  The two of them played against each other, and with each other so believably,  one could see the chemistry between them.  If you're a Swayze fan, go ahead, take a chance, you won't be disappointed.",1511827200,,931,4.354651162790698
