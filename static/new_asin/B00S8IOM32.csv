6964619,5,B00S8IOM32,"I have to say, I was afraid this adaptation from one of my favorite anime was going to be a complete failure like many other cases, but after the first few minutes of the first movie, I knew this was the real deal!  Hands down perfect, and this second movie is as excellent and beautiful as the first one!  The final scene is bone chilling, and you just find yourself wanting to have a time machine to skip the days waiting for the third one to arrive, I hope it ships soon because I cant wait!!!",1425340800,,496,4.15625
6964620,5,B00S8IOM32,"Product is as shown / described.  Japanese & Cantonese audio, English and Traditional Chinese subtitles.  This blu-ray release is legit and of perfect quality.  If you're a fan of the Kenshin series (in any form) this 2nd part of the ""trilogy"" of live action movies is worth getting in my opinion (but be prepared to order the 3rd installment, as this leaves with a pretty dang good cliffhanger).
**Because I don't like how Amazon lumps all reviews for similar products in the same boat regardless of who the seller was, I want to add that I purchased this from seller ""Far East Flea Market""; again, legit and worth it.  (Amazon: Reviews should be allowed to make this type of comment at very least, please do not disallow this post)",1425168000,2,733,4.658914728682171

8697650,4,B00S8IOM32,Awesome adaption to the manga/anime series.  Loved all the people that were chosen to play these beloved roles!  It was great to see this story come to live action.  My only complaint is that the Aoshi Shinomori story bit was not as fleshed out and felt like his story was just added on as an after thought.  Which is unfortunate because his story is just as compelling as the others.  I was very squealy-happy about how the trilogy ended! HEEEEE! :D,1461110400,,450,4.506172839506172
