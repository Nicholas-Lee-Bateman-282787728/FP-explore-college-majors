3627799,2,B001HB3PMQ,"The teaming of Christopher Lee and Boris Karloff was enough to bring horror fans in to see ""The Curse of the Crimson Altar"" (which also goes by the title ""The Crimson Cult,"" for some reason) on release, but even they can do only so much to keep this weak and tired entry in the late-1960's faux Hammer/Amicus subgenre afloat.  At least Lee and Karloff have scenes together; all too often in these kinds of marquee team-ups, the horror stars are not even seen in the same shot.  Even better, despite his age and illness at the time, Karloff gives an excellent performance, tootling around in a wheelchair (he attempts to stand in one scene, and it's painful to watch his effort) while dispensing professorial authority.  Lee is also good in a more casual and natural role than he was often given at this point in time, and for Sixties horror fans there are also supporting appearances by Barbara Steele as a green witch (though in some scenes she comes off more pewter), and Michael Gough, unusually cast as a mentally ill servant.  It all sounds good, doesn't it?  The real problem is that all these great actors don't have much to act.  The script is muddled and confusing, and uses the old ""my-[fill-in-the-blank relation]-has-disappeared-and-this-creepy-old-house-was-the-last-place-they-were-seen"" wheeze to get the ball rolling.  There are attempts by director Vernon Sewell and cinematographer John Coquillon to create Hammer-style atmosphere, but they are not successful.  There is also a train-wreck melding of ""mod"" pseudo-orgy scenes and quasi-S&M shots that look like an attempt to recreate mid-sixties Euro horror, that belong in some other movie.  Preferably, an unreleased one.  Nominal hero and heroine Mark Eden (a wooden Indian) and Virginia Wetherell, whose character motivation is nonexistent, make no impression, and the ending is just downright ridiculous.  Watch this for Karloff and Lee only.",1311724800,5,1915,5.2052117263843645
3627800,2,B001HB3PMQ,"Based on H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Dreams in the Witch House,"" this dreary British chiller wastes the talents of Boris Karloff, Christopher Lee, Barbara Steele and Michael Gough. Despite his limited screen time, Karloff remains a pleasure to watch and helps enliven the routine proceedings. ""Curse of the Crimson Altar"" (1968) has its admirers, yet most horror aficionados will be disappointed with the overall blandness. Karloff's final big-screen role before his infamous Mexican productions.",1304640000,5,491,5.648648648648648
3627828,2,B001HB3PMQ,"Saw this in the movies and it's still an embarrassment. The cast is of course great but the scriptlines still make me cringe. Like the blu-ray, the original music is replaced in this version by the ubiquitous  Kendall Schmitt. ""I always knew he had a split mind, "" Boris said.",1506211200,,276,4.52
3627829,3,B001HB3PMQ,"Good solid offering out of the  UK from the 1960's. I actually saw this in the movie with the title ""The Crimson Curse"" on a double bill with ""The Dunwich Horror"" when I was a very young. The film is by no means a masterpiece but I find it enjoyable in a fun , tongue in cheek almost camp way. You see the ending coming a mile away but that doesn't bother me. A fun light and also very sexy in a light fun camp way.  The 1960's orgy/ party, the way the leading man almost molests the big haired blond leading lady constantly as ""seduction ..And the gay Leather Daddy witches sequence. ???? No Big deal but enjoyable. But I grew up watching these movies so I also have the luxury of nostalgia.",1505174400,4,692,4.156716417910448
3627830,5,B001HB3PMQ,"the UK Blu-ray of CURSE OF THE CRIMSON ALTAR is the definitive version to get- fully uncut with the original Peter Knight score to boot! Based on a short story by HP Lovecraft, I personally found the movie entertaining and enjoy repeated viewings. Colour is strong and vibrant and the audio is very clear. The U.S.  release version is the same transfer-also used for the full screen laserdisc- with the rescore job done but purist's will want this one!",1464480000,4,452,4.7215189873417724

3627833,3,B001HB3PMQ,"This movie is disappointing considering the cast and the concept. Unfortunately, there is not enough gothic atmosphere and very few chills. Karloff and Lee are both good, but kept too much on the sidelines. Barbara Steele has little more than a cameo. The best aspect of the film is the lovely Virginia Wetherell, who gives an intelligent and provocative performance.

If you want to watch a good movie with a similar theme, I highly recommend ""City of the Dead""/""Horror Hotel"" (1960).",1416960000,4,485,4.987654320987654

3627836,5,B001HB3PMQ,"(10/27/2014)Because of Amazon's quirk about posting reviews, I could not post a new review for this brand new blu ray release since I'd already reviewed the import DVD!!

This new blu ray from the UK is the ultimate version.  It's from a beautiful print and widescreen 1.66:1.  If you get this one, you already know about the film itself, so I won't go into that.

This UK blu ray is actually ""region free"" (A,B,C) and played well in my domestic region A player.

A major supplement is included: the complete Sir Christopher Lee segment from Odeon's 2012 release of BRITISH LEGENDS OF STAGE AND SCREEN.  This is an hour long program about Lee and features an extensive interview along with many great film clips.  Excellent program and makes this worth the rather hefty price.

If you're a fan of this film, this is probably as close to a definitive blu ray release as we're going to get.",1370304000,10,888,4.611464968152866
3627837,1,B001HB3PMQ,"Christopher Lee is a superb actor as is of course Boris Karloff as you can see by their roles in this film and the surprise ending,however the film is just a bunch of hippie AND writer H.P.(can't stand his stuff) Lovecraft mumbojumbo occult/pagan matters,there were so many of these films made in the 60's and 70's,this film is a bunch of fruitcakes in s&m garb and some bizarre witch along with a plot that does not make sense.

8308394,5,B001HB3PMQ,"Enjoyable, but not great, late 60's British horror film.  Supposedly Boris Karloff's last British-made film.  A young antiques dealer goes to an English manor house in search of his missing brother and encounters witchcraft is the beautiful shape of Barbara Steele (in garish green makeup) and her scantily clad minions, both men and women.  Some people should NOT be minimally dressed.  Stars Christopher Lee as the lord of the manor and Michael Gough as the rattled manservant.  Boris Karloff plays the local expert on witchcraft.  Also has a bunch of young local well-to-doers playing autumnal adult games, like American grown-up trick-or-treaters.  Karloff has an amusing moment when he asks the young man to come see his collection.  When the young man asks what he collects Karloff smiles urbanely and says ""instruments of torture"" like he was saying antique snuff boxes.  Priceless.  The film has some needless nudity.  Filmed at a beautiful mansion that was once owned by either Gilbert or Sullivan.  Has some extras, including memories by two of the minor stars who remember Lee as being an OK guy and Karloff as being a delight.  The British-made Region A Blu-ray is excellent quality and plays beautifully on US Blu-ray machines.  Highly recommended.",1509840000,2,1261,5.147783251231527
8308395,5,B001HB3PMQ,"This is one of my very favorite 70s British horror films. It stars Christopher Lee, Boris Karloff and the great Barbara Steele as Lavinia, The Black Witch of Greymarsh. The opening scene is worth the purchase price alone. Lavinia is blue with a huge headdress, trying to encourage Peter Manning to sign his soul to the devil. There is a nude woman being to be sacrificed, who is whipped by a black leather clad dominatrix, a blacksmith, wearing only horns and a leather apron, heating branding irons, a masked audience, etc. all while Lavinia repeats ""Sign! Sign! Sign!""
The acting is as good, if not better than most of the Hammer films of the era. The story is not new, but the characters are fun! It delivers all the best of 70s era horror!
I first watched it on Netflix, then could not find it on DVD, except a weird bootleg, so I was really excited to finally find it on BluRay!
I love this movie and will watch it over and over for years to come!",1508976000,,952,4.3841807909604515

8308397,3,B001HB3PMQ,Mr. Karloff one of the greatest most iconic horror stars (all you have to say is FRANKENSTEIN!) and Mr. Lee an equally great actor in the same genre (DRACULA). They make an excellent gruesome twosome in what is a passable not very exciting horror flick about a dead witch played by Ms. Steel exacting revenge on those that did her in. Mild nudity included that must have been risqu for the time when this movie was produced but honestly these actors really deserved better. It made me think their only reason to be in something like this was just to collect a paycheck!!!,1507593600,,571,4.553398058252427
