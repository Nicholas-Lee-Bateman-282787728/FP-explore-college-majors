2166009,5,B00064AMEE,"If your daughter is an American Girl fan, she will love this movie.  I watched it on TV with my daughter and enjoyed it myself.  It's nice to see a positive, wholesome movie for girls.  And there's a bit of history as well, showing the sweatshops and orphanages of the time period.",1101859200,4,281,4.365384615384615
2166010,5,B00064AMEE,I saw this movie on WB and I must say this movie is one of the very good movies that I have seen. Especially Samantha's (AnnaSophia Robb) performance is outstanding. Such a talent at her age is brilliant. Just waiting to buy the DVD version on release !,1101686400,5,253,4.291666666666667
2166011,5,B00064AMEE,"Because I had also grown up with the American Girls (remembering when there were only three dolls in the entire series), I was delighted to learn that a favorite childhood series would be on television.

Samantha Parkington lives with her wealthy Grandmary in Mount Bedford New York. She is desperate for a friend her own age so when Nellie O'Malley and her family move in next door to become the Ryland family servants, Samantha is giddy with excitement. Finally somebody to play with!

Soon after she begins to hang out with Nellie, Samantha makes an uncomfortable realization that not every child is able to enjoy the leisure activities which she has taken for granted. Instead, Nellie has to work for her own survival. Because work is a new concept for Samantha, she did not recognize that Mrs. Ryland would have been offended by the impromptu sleepover held in the boathouse after Samantha thought she was unwanted by Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia.

When Samantha attempts to track Nellie down after Bridget becomes sick, she discovers what factories are really like. In an indictment which (unfortunately remains relevant) Nellie tells Samantha that people do not like to think about where the clothes they buy come from. Samantha was visibly horrified to learn her fine and elegant clothes came from a dirty factory which hurt other children who were not much older than herself.

Samantha did not win the speaking contest at school in this version of the tale, but she did impress Aunt Cornelia--who promptly asked Samantha to give the anti-child labor speech for her women's group. Uncle Gard's good natured teasing indicated that he actually likes independent women who are not afraid to stand up for their rights.

In addition to the classist analysis, I also appreciated Aunt Cornelia's suffragist friends reminding Samantha that it was important for young women to become involved in efforts to win the vote (and presumably other rights). Inter-generational mentoring ensures the causes we care about are not time sensitive.

The movie takes some liberties with the series (the 'birthday story' and the 'summer story' are eliminated altogether), characters (Gertrude is too nice, and Nellie's father never appeared in the books...etc) but I was generally pleased with the casting decisions. I also liked the transitions between time----which really could have been botched since covering most of a book series is very difficult in an hour.

This movie is recommended to anybody who likes family fare without excessive sugar mixed in.",1101427200,4,2545,5.118072289156626
2166012,5,B00064AMEE,I thought this movie was great. And the acting was pretty impressive. AnnaSophia Robb was really great. I thought this movie had a lot of good lessons. And all in all it was just a really great movie. I definately recommend watching or buying the DVD!,1101340800,2,251,4.478260869565218
2166013,5,B00064AMEE,"This was a fun movie!  Ahh Samantha, she was in a funny way my first historical exposure to women's sufferage and the right to vote and things of that sort.  I read those books when I was quite small, back in the days when there were only three girls: Kirsten, Samantha, and Molly.  All the books included a historical fact section in the back of them, making the tales about the fictional characters that much powerful and fascinating.

But as for the movie, I liked it a lot.  I think they did a fairly accurate retelling of the first few books.  I liked Mia Farrow as Grandmere, and the little girl that played Samantha did a pretty good job.  It was kind of strange to see Samantha's Uncle Gard sort of... fuel her crush for him, in a way.. but, he was married in the film so he didn't come off as too inherently creepy I think... Overall it was a truly heartwarming and fulfilling tale, filled with fun moments for families and old fans alike.",1101254400,4,948,4.3522727272727275
2166014,4,B00064AMEE,"I grew up with the American girls collection and I have all the dolls. NOw I am 20 years old and so excited that they finally made a movie based on one the dolls. However, I was a little disappointed that the movie drifted away from the books, but still a good job done!",1101254400,,270,4.018518518518518
2166015,3,B00064AMEE,"the story was good, i liked the morals it had for children about clasism, the acting wasn't that great but i think children won't mind the acting much and will enjoy it for it's story, especialy kids who are into the books",1101254400,4,222,4.309523809523809
2166016,5,B00064AMEE,We watched it last night on the WB.  My daughter can't stop talking about the show. She has the Samantha doll and we have read all the books.

2166052,5,B00064AMEE,we watched this movie and really enjoyed it so we watched it again! It is about samantha who lives with her grandmother because her parents were killed. She loves her uncle gard so much and he gets married to her disappointment at first but eventually moves in with him and his wife who also adopt her orphaned friend nellie and her 2 sisters. Samantha is played by anna sophia robb who does a fantastic job portraying samantha! Its a must see movie for all ages.,1468368000,,463,4.458823529411765
2166053,4,B00064AMEE,"If you liked the movie Pollyanna, you will enjoy this nice little snapshot of life during the transition between the late 1800s and the early days of the 20th century. The lifestyle of the wealthy and the lower class is subtly contrasted as the story unfolds. The scenery and costuming is beautiful and effectively contrasted by the attire and dwellings of the wealthy and those that serve them. The bucolic and pastoral setting of Samantha's home  regally stationed along the Hudson River shifts to New York City where the poor do not fare as well as their countryside peers. Through dialogue and twists of the story's plot, we begin to recognize how the role of corruption and ignorance among both classes played huge roles in the fate of the have-nots. It also shows how one person can rouse others to take an interest in a cause and work hard to make improvements in the quality of life for others. While the movie is probably of greater interest to a younger audience and those who enjoy romantic stories, the movie's moral and civic values present a grand opportunity to bring history to life and become a resource to understanding a transitional period in history and what parallels we might find within our own time. If you are looking for a quaint romantic story with strong values and happy endings, this is for you.",1467072000,4,1326,4.7155172413793105

2166084,4,B00064AMEE,"My daughter loved this movie! She wanted to watch it several times with my old Samantha doll. As an adult, I don't know what I was expecting but this movie did not live up to my expectations. I found it pretty boring. I'm giving it 4 stars because this movie truly delighted my 5 year old and I think she, and not me, is the target viewer.",1460851200,2,339,4.074626865671642
2166085,5,B00064AMEE,"This film is absolutely spectacular! I watched it with my sister mainly because we were such fans of the American Girl dolls and books growing up, but I wasn't expecting anything quite so thought-provoking, emotional, or heartwarming. The plot follows Samantha, a young girl in 1904 whose parents have died. She lives with her grandmother in Mount Bedford, and later with her aunt and uncle in New York City. Throughout the film we experience the realities of the time. We catch a glimpse of the suffragette movement, child labor, factory work, and orphanages. I really liked that the film didn't sugarcoat these things, but also didn't linger on them in a way that would be scarring to children. I highly recommend the film to children and adults interested in historical fiction, political movements, social justice, and the value of friendship. Samantha is a wonderful role model for young girls and boys everywhere.",1460592000,,919,5.052631578947368

I've seen several of the other American Girl movies and loved them - the Revolutionary War era was just wonderful as was Kit Kitteridge..

It got us talking about how it takes special people in the world to make changes; the movie addresses suffrage and child labor.

This story serves as a tool to reach a young generation that are to learn about charity and good will as part of their training so that they will be good leaders in the future.

2166174,5,B00064AMEE,"I have to say Im impressed by the quality of these American Girl films: the casting is excellent and the attention to period details (for those films that are set in earlier times) is satisfactory and credible. This film focuses on Samantha Parkington (played by the talented Anna Sophia Robb who was also in Bridge to Terabithia, another family favorite) who is a rich orphan living with her grandmother, Grandmere (played by Mia Farrow) in a grand home near the Hudson River in New York. Samantha is a compassionate, intelligent, and pleasant young woman who upon meeting the OMally girls, immediately takes to them. The OMally girls, especially Nellie, becomes Samanthas close friend despite the difference in their social status. The OMallys are hired help who work on Samanthas grandmothers estate.
The story becomes more interesting after Samantha moves to the New York City to live with her beloved uncle and his new wife, Cornelia. Samantha discovers that Cornelia is kind and passionate about causes, especially the suffragette movement. Samantha also finds it difficult at first adjusting to life in a new city, a new home, and school but gradually blends in. When she receives news that Nellies father has died and the OMally girls have been sent to an orphanage in NYC, Samantha becomes actively involved in helping the girls, and in the process discovers that she too shares her aunts passion for causes.
My nine-year-old loved this story as did I. There are many themes in the film such as the emancipation of women, the fact that child labor was common back in the day, and how there was a stark difference between the way the rich and poor lived (although that is still very much present today). The poor working conditions in factories where children were employed was horrifying to my daughter and she was disturbed to learn that such things still occur today, especially in third world countries.
The Christmas part of the story is really just part of the overall story so if you are expecting a film dedicated solely to a Christmas theme, you will be disappointed. My daughter and I found this film to be well-scripted and well-acted and certainly found it engaging.",1419379200,,2186,4.910810810810811

2166186,4,B00064AMEE,It was a cute movie. My daughter and I enjoyed it. I don't really like how AG movies always make the adults out to be idiots and how the child acts in disobedience or deceit and everything turns out okay. But this is clean entertainment and gives us a chance to talk about those parts and what we might do different.,1418860800,,316,4.19672131147541

2166283,5,B00064AMEE,"This review is dictated to me by my 7.5 year old daughter:

As shared in my title, this movie reminds me of the title of one of the books in the Samantha series: Samantha Learns a Lesson. Samantha, for me, is a hero. She breaks the law but only to try and make things fair for Nellie, Bridget and Jenny. It's a meaningful story and almost made me cry with joy. It makes me think that every time I'll watch it, I'll think of ways I can be better and more courageous.

2166288,5,B00064AMEE,Enjoyed the recreation of one of my childhood favorites! Entertaining for children and adults. A very good find on Prime.,1394841600,,121,5.1
2166289,5,B00064AMEE,"I love history, and this turn-of-the-century film looked interesting enough that I decided to give it a whirl. I'm very glad I did.

The relationship between Samantha, her 'Grandmary,' and especially her Uncle Gard was great. The grandmother obviously loved her, and took her in after her parents were killed in a boating accident. The uncle is the kind of uncle we all wish we were blessed with. Wasn't sure how much I would like Cornelia (Gard's fiancee/wife), but she quickly became a favorite, too. It was the relationship between Samantha and Nellie I loved the most though.

Samantha grew up in a privileged family, while Nellie was raised the daughter of a poor laborer, yet after they meet, they become the best of friends. There are places that will make you mad, places where you may be outraged at the way poor children were treated back then, but mostly you will just enjoy this movie - if historical family movies are your thing.",1394409600,,942,4.737804878048781

2166304,1,B00064AMEE,"The movie was slow and sentimental to the point of driving me a little nutty. My granddaughter who is a huge American Girl Doll fan was doing other things besides watching the movie. We asked her if she wanted to stop it and she said no, but was soon distracted again. I would not suggest viewing this movie.",1390953600,2,308,4.327586206896552

2166310,5,B00064AMEE,"I love the American Girl movies! They capture the spirit of the time periods they represent in a way that is easy for young viewers to understand without being overly dramatic or traumatic. ""Samantha"" tells the tale of a girl of privilege from upstate NY who, upon moving with her aunt and uncle to NYC, experiences a very different side of life - orphanages and child labor. As with all of the American Girl movies, the main character is the heroine without being too preachy or self-righteous. Enjoy!",1389398400,,502,4.715909090909091
2166311,5,B00064AMEE,"This was a surprisingly good movie! I've never read the books nor do I know anyone who's read them. I also don't know much about American Girl, except that they're dolls. So I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie was. Fully expecting it to be cheesy, it actually dealt with some pretty heavy issues: women's rights, child labor, orphans at the turn of the century in the U.S. It wasn't too heavy-handed or preachy; nor did it seem like a history lesson. But it was robust enough to be engaging for an adult. A great holiday movie, when you need something on in the background for mixed company. Or when you're bored and nothing else looked good on Amazon Prime Instant Video :)",1389139200,,688,4.512
2166312,5,B00064AMEE,"I really enjoyed this ""feel good"" movie. A great selection for anyone with good lessons and morals. It takes place in 1904 and could be considered educational and historical.",1389052800,,174,5.0344827586206895

2166322,5,B00064AMEE,It's gets my grandmother seal of approval and I bought it as a DVD gift on Amazon :-) The costumes are lovely and the history is somewhat true but perhaps not as cruel as it really was in the days of orphan trains and child labor.,1388361600,,230,4.021739130434782

2166332,1,B00064AMEE,"The movie started out fine, but when the scene comes up where the boy gets his hand caught in the sewing machine and the man yells at him, it really scared my nine-year old daughter. She cried for a while and then couldn't go to sleep that night. It was unnecessary.",1387843200,2,266,4.235294117647059

2166355,5,B00064AMEE,"i was not expecting much from this movie when i sat down to choose a freebie to watch with my almost six year old daughter, but i chose this because when i was a little girl i liked samantha and that generation of american girl dolls, so i thought it would at least be better than most of the other movies offered for kids. i ended up watching the whole thing with her! i also like historical pieces, so that was a bonus, but the story line was pretty good too. the acting was so-so, mostly the kids, but hey i am not here to be a harsh critic. just seems like they could have hired a better acting coach for them. either way, my daughter liked it very much so that's all that matters. it gives a look into samantha's life at turn of the century new york, and her friend, a poor little girl named nellie who has to work as a maid and then in  factory.  it doesn't sugar coat everything, either, it raises some good points about child labor, orphanages, etc that a child older than 5 or so could handle. it was handled in a way that was not too intense for younger viewers, but was still somewhat realistic. and a happy ending!! i will definitely look into purchasing this or at least put it on our watch-list. it's so hard to find nice movies for little girls that have some substance but aren't either obnoxious or inappropriate or overly moralistic. this one hits all the right notes. i would recommend it for girls 5 years old and up ! and moms won't mind watching it with them, which is nice!",1387065600,,1496,4.2272727272727275

2166375,5,B00064AMEE,"I liked ""Samantha: An American Girl Holiday"" very much indeed. It is a rather gentle tale but one that is not afraid to tackle such issues as family loyalty, class divisions, women's suffrage, and child labor. The title character, Samantha Parkington, is played by AnnaSophia Robb, and she is absolutely wonderful, with an expressive face and an honest approach to her craft that leads us, the viewers, to believe wholeheartedly in her on-screen portrayal. Samantha seems utterly real, and that of course is the highest compliment to which any actor can aspire. There are no weaknesses in the cast, and special accolades should go to Kelsey Lewis, who plays Samantha's best friend, Nellie O'Malley, and to Jordan Bridges, who plays Uncle Gard. Direction and cinematography are splendid throughout, with an effective sense of period (1904). The musical score is lovely, supportive of the action, and (most important of all) non-intrusive, never calling attention to itself.

2166402,5,B00064AMEE,"This was a second American Girl movie we have watched with our 7 year old.
The first was Kit. My daughter did enjoy the Kit movie but she simply LOVED Samantha.
This movie is really good to teach a child family values and sensitivity to other people needs. It also creates an amazing opportunity for a child to get a perspective on her life comparing it to the children featured in the movie.

There is a good very straight foward approach to picture two contrasting social classes - wealthy and poor and it is very no-nonsence image.
It is not too harsh or too brutal as far as reality is concerned as those times could be shown in veristic way that would be inapropriate - this movie is not doing it.

It has certain amount of realistic situtations and it feels real. It is just enough to create believable backdrop for the main characters and explain their struggles.

Although the main character parents are apparently not alive when the character is introduced and the little friends do not have mother either and father dies eventually, none of those events are rubbed upon a watching child, they are mentionned in very matter-of fact manner and only to explain their current state of mind, emotions or situation, but the director smartly does not circle aorund it and does not rub it into your kid untill it will be painful to deal with on screen. Nothing like that.

I am very sensitive to this kind of topics and try to monitor if any such a topic is gently introduced and this definitely passed the standards.

It is good for a modern girl to realize the hard times of the past, it is good to realize that not everybody is lucky to have a welth and grow up in a family that does not struggle to put a bread on the table, and it shows
that it was not always a case in the past. Children do hear about poor people, poor kids.. and for them it is pure fiction. They who did not experienced going to bed hungry, having to work for the piece of bread have hard time to understand those who do. This movie makes a child more aware
of certain social situations and it helps to grow a sensitive person to the needs of others.

Today's children can totally benefit from watching this kind of movies.
It is a nice surprising movie from the company which name is associated with catering to wealthy and the products are expensive and hardly affordable to anybody else but upper class, therefore the movie might bring some interesting feelings into a life of a child who otherwise is not exposed to real life situations of this kind.",1355097600,,2531,4.455723542116631
2166403,5,B00064AMEE,"Seldom, do we find movies of this quality with family values in the story. It was a heart warming story, with wonderful acting and a great story line. Thank you to the producers! We need more movies like this one.",1354060800,,213,4.35
2166404,5,B00064AMEE,"This movie was wonderful.  The acting was great, especially for children.  I am in my late 20's and I still loved it.  It even made me cry during a few of the scenes, but I would definitely watch it again.  This movie has a great message and I hope that people watch it.  I wish more people in this world cared as ""Samantha"" did.  Laws do not necessarily made a good people, but the hearts and the morals of people change the world for the better.

They really are my favorite kids movies because they promote kindness, values and virtue.

My daughter has watched this 4 times since we got it last week.",1314316800,,324,4.161290322580645
2166417,4,B00064AMEE,"I'd never heard of ""American Girl Dolls"" until accompanying two grand-daughters aged 5 and 6 to the ""doll house"" in Water Tower Place (Chicago), where I was greeted by two floors of the latest ""must-have"" toy (personally, I prefer Barbie).  Brunettes, blondes, dolls with and without glasses, dolls in wheel-chairs, injured cheerleader dolls with broken legs in splints--they're all here.  And of course there's a doll hospital (glancing at the rates was enough to make me wonder about Medicare or a similar back-up plan for dolls) and hair stylist (charging three times more than my barber).  Soon the color pink began to overwhelm all other colors, making it difficult not only to distinguish among dolls but to separate the doll's diner from the doll's dressing room (though expect to break the monotony of pink with a generous amount of green when it comes time to pay up).

I was about to purchase the video ""Samantha"" as a gift to grand-daughter Samantha and her doll Samantha--perhaps a way to intensify and prolong the experience.  I'm glad I waited.  Amazon's price for the video is half the sticker price at American Girl Store. [I said ""was."" Suddenly Amazon's price is only 10-15% lower than the store's.]  But it's also a fairly impressive movie--just under 90 minutes, decent production values (recreating the two main classes of late Victorian society), an exceptional print (Blu Ray, richly saturated deep colors, carefully composed shots), exceptional performances (the child actress playing Samantha is a natural and even Mia Farrow is no less attractive for finally looking her age).

The plot is simple, raising more questions than it answers, but the sentiment works, thanks to the Dickensian tone, which distances us enough from the subject to avoid blatant, patronizing melodrama.  Still, an attempt to criticize employers who will stop at nothing (including the unconscionable exploitation of children in factories operating on the backs of orphans) misses the mark.  Far more effective is the representation of a romantic couple not so preoccupied with their infatuation for each other and personal plans for creation of their own nuclear family to open not merely their pocketbooks but their hearts and home to three orphaned children.  No matter that the orphanage is still not lacking for residents: the magnanimous gesture of the newly-married couple is an act of love that remains with the viewer because it goes ""all the way,"" serving as a reminder that every child deserves a loving family.

The ties that bind the human family go beyond mere blood, religious (or political) affiliations, ethnicity, race, and even social status and wealth (though it's clear that the adopting, newly-married couple of the movie are sufficiently financed to start out as a quintet rather than a couple). No one likes abortion, but a story as simple as this makes the point that human selfishness that ""kills"" the spirit of living children is even more despicable.",1312070400,,2978,5.130165289256198
2166418,5,B00064AMEE,"This is a wonderful story for children of all ages.  Even the adults in our family enjoy this movie.  A must see, and certainly a great addition to any collection of holiday traditions that one watches year after year.",1296086400,,218,4.564102564102564

2166425,5,B00064AMEE,"Samantha - An American Girl Holiday was actually filmed in Canada and not in New York state where it is set. But regardless, the cast does a nice job. Mia Farrow is perfect as the no nonsense Grandmary who raised her since her parents' death in a boating accident.

The film takes serious issues such as child labor, orphanages, and factory conditions and the fight for women's right to vote.

The children actors do a very good job in their roles particularly Samantha, Eddie, Nellie, Bridget, and Jenny along with the adults. Sadly, I don't notice any other familiar names with the exception of course, Mia Farrow.

The film follows the book series of the same name. It's an okay story and suitable for family viewing.

Young girls who are fans of the book series will find this DVD to feature clips such as a tour of the New York City store.

Another clip is a few minutes in understanding the Victorian/Edwardian wedding rituals, traditions, and history by Eve Faulkner. I found this interesting for those of us interested in that time period.",1274572800,,1047,4.699453551912568

Nicely done, good cloths and historical scenery, good actors, so that the kids can learn about the past. It did look that some of the parts were shortened artficially therefore I wish that the movie was either longer or divided into several parts, so that it would explain more about feminism or child labor rather than just touching it on the surface.

Still, great to watch I wish there was more movies like that with edicational and moral values for both genders.",1263945600,2,727,4.6796875

I recently purchased this video to share with my 8 year old daughters third grade class.  They were going to visit the Governor's Mansion on a field trip. This is a wonderful victorian home. Rather than just seeing it as is today, I wanted them to see the video to get an idea of life in the early 1900""s. i also wanted them to understand the problems that children and society had at that time. This movie clearly shows people dealing with issues like Womens Sufferage, Child labor, and the lack of mandatory education.

2166442,4,B00064AMEE,"*It is strange that as a guy who had children's lit in college, and is married to a teacher, and has raised two girls of my own, one of which is an English teacher, that I had never heard of An American Girl Series. After reading a review on one of the books I thought my Grand daughter might like them, and then when night while doing some maintenance on my youngest girl's computer, I saw the set on her book shelf. I asked her about them, (she said they were my oldest girls books) and she started reading them and has enjoyed them very much.

While home for Christmas vacation, my wife and I decided to watch this DVD ""Samantha- an American Girl Holiday"" and we quite enjoyed it. To be honest though, the acting was a bit stilted, especially by the two young stars of the movie, which is usually the case with young kids in starring roles, but they were such beautiful children and the story was so sweet, that it didn't seem to matter much.

This story is a story about love and friendship and also of women's rights as well as children's rights. Set in the beginning of the twentieth century and the dawn of the industrial revolution. It is an interesting tale of the two America's of the era.

2166445,5,B00064AMEE,"By way of disclosure, I am an American Girls Junkie, as are my wife and daughter.  Their books and movies provide an excellent mechanism with which to teach living history to young girls.  ""Samantha, An American Girl Holiday"" is no exception.

For those of you unfamiliar with Samantha, she is a wealthy orphan living in New York in 1904.  This movie tells the story of Samantha's developing friendship with Nellie O' Malley, the daughter of an Irish domestic servant.  As the film progresses, the viewer enjoys the breakdown of distinctions between social classes, first among the children, then among the adults.

From an historical perspective, it shows the life of the wealthy, their servants and the suffragette movement.

The movie is Pollyannaish, to be sure, but still delightful.  Enjoy as you learn!",1216512000,,809,5.075757575757576

2166450,5,B00064AMEE,"Girls who search for American Girl stories in book stores and parents who purchase them all the time for them will both enjoy this warm holiday treat based on the very popular Samantha. The books about young Samantha are among the most popular in the sought after series. Authors Valerie Tripp, Susan S. Adler, and Maxine Rose Schur have all contributed to the character wonderfully brought to life by director Nadia Tass in this most enjoyable holiday film for the family.

Set during the turn of the century in Bedford, New York, Samantha finds three friends in Nelly (Kelsey Lewis), Jennie (Olivia Ballantyne), and Bridget O'Malley (Hannah Endicott-Douglas), three young girls without the luxuries afforded Samantha with her Grandmary (Mia Farrow) who have come to work next door. Nellie is Samantha's age and soon they are best friends. Annasophia Robb was the perfect choice for Samantha and  is also excellent as her best pal Nellie.

Samantha's Uncle Gard (Jordan Bridges), her last real tie to her deceased mother, has come to visit and brought with him an independent woman named Cornelia (Rebecca Maddy) he is engaged to marry. Worried she will be forgotten at first, Samantha soon warms to her and offers her mother's bridal veil when hers is damaged by fire. She is separated from Nellie and her friends, however, when she must go to New York City with the newly married couple while her grandmary vacations.

Set in 1904, it is nice to see through Samantha's eyes the changing times as she writes to Nellie about her adventures in the big city. When Nellie's father dies, however, the three girls are sent to an orphanage where they are mistreated. Samantha's school paper on factories will change drastically when she sees firsthand the dangerous child labor used in them while searching for her friend. Samantha hides the girls in her home after helping them escape but must reveal the truth when little Bridget becomes ill.

While it may be a predictable solution the viewer can see coming from the very beginning, there is a real warmth here and a special Christmas for everyone's favorite American Girl, Samantha. This is a very nice film for the holidays families will delight in, especially those with girls Samantha's age and younger. Those who enjoy the books or hear about them all the time from their kids will not be disappointed by this nicely filmed movie set during Christmas. A good one.",1181433600,3,2416,4.897310513447433

Most of the actors filled their parts gracefully, and the plot was well laid out. Samantha's friendship with Nellie O'Malley was convincing if simple, and her relationships with Grandmary, her uncle, and her new Aunt Cornelia were potrayed as complex and interpersonal. How refreshing to have a story about a girl who is wealthy but not selfish -- who enjoys nothing more than giving to others, not only things, but of herself. Samantha is a fun but lady-like character who young girls can both relate to and learn from.

Bedford, New York. Samantha is being raised by her grandmother as her parents died in a boat accident while she was an infant. As the movie begins Samantha is playing with Eddie Rylan, her neighbor. Samantha's grandmother is raising her to take her place in society, however Samantha likes to run, jump and climb trees, quite the contrast to what her GrandMary has in mind. The Rylan's have recently hired an Irish immigrant family from New York City to serve as their live in servants. The family is comprised of a widower,Mr. O'Malley and his three daughters, Nellie, Bridget and Jenny. The family had lived in New York City where the girls worked in a thread factory to support their family. After meeting the O'Malley's Samantha's Uncle Gardner comes to visit with his fiancee' Corneila. Samantha is not pleased with their engagement, but over time accepts Corneila as part of their family and even gives Corneila her mother's wedding veil after hers is destroyed by fire. Samantha moves to New York City to live with Uncle Garnder and Aunt Cornelia while GrandMary leaves to visit relatives out of state. While living in New York Samantha discovers that the O'Malley sisters have lost their father and are living at Cold Rock Orphange which is controlled by the nasty Mrs. Frouchy. Samantha also discovers that Mrs. Frouchy is embellzing money from the orphange and has plans to split up the O'Malley sisters by sending Nellie on the orphan train. Samantha and Nellie plan for the girls escape, which leads them to Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila's attic. All is going well until Bridget becomes sick, leaving Samantha to confess to her Aunt and Uncle what she has done. In the meantime Gardner and Cornelia learn of what really goes on at Cold Rock Orphange and through Mrs. Vandergelds assistance bring an end to the reign of Mrs. Frouchy. In the end Uncle Gardner and Aunt Corneila ask Samantha to stay with them permanently as GrandMary is getting married. On Christmas morning there is a surprise for everyone, Gardner and Corneila are planning to adopt the O'Malley girls so Samantha will have sisters and they will be a family.

My girls still love watching it.  Recently, we picked up the 6 book set of Samantha books.  They are anxious to get started on the books since they already know the characters.

This movie was sweet and enjoyable as well as well-cast (although Mia Farrow's Grandmary was a bit younger and less stern than the Grandmary in the books). A few changes have been made to the plot; for example, Aunt Cornelia's younger sisters Agnes and Agatha, who are Samantha's age, have been left out (probably the biggest and most disappointing change to the story); Jenny, Nellie's sister, is now mute; and Samantha's speaking out against child labor in a speaking contest gets her disqualified from the contest, unlike in the book, where she wins the contest. However, the movie's plot still has many scenes Samantha fans will recognize from the books, and Samantha fans will enjoy seeing actress AnnaSophia Robb (Samantha) dressed in all of the clothes girls can buy for their Samantha doll.

The settings and costumes are great. The acting is good. The story is wonderful. Yes, it's romantic and highly unrealistic, but so are a zillion other movies. I've seen criticism of this movie because it's so ""goody-goody."" Well, if that means addressing issues such as child labor and child abuse, and presenting such personal qualities as unselfishness and incredible bravery on the part of children, then the movie is guilty. But I see no reason why anyone would object to the story other than out of intellectual snobbery and arrogance. It's not syrupy or cloying. I found it engaging, funny, and incredibly moving.

I was looking very forward to the movie and was quite pleased when I saw the result. It invokes an Anne of Green Gables feeling - something warm and fuzzy that we despirately need these days.

  Now as for the acting....Wow, hokey.  But, forgivable.  I mean, it's a made for TV movie.  What does one expect.  The bad acting is the ONLY reason it's dropped down to a 4.

I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I really liked it, and my husband did too.  Some of the actors are better than others, but AnnaSophia Robb really carries her role.  If her hair color were as convincing as her acting, it would be easy to get lost in the moment.  Mia Farrow, Jordan Bridges, and Rebecca Mader all do a great job, as well.
I did notice some odd little plot changes and wonder why they were there.  Was Jessie's storyline cut because of time restrictions?  Was it impossible to include non-Nellie-related adventures?  Did we really see, in the movie, how important Lydia (the doll) was to Samantha and how significant it was to give her away?  And wasn't the jar stolen from Eddie Ryland originally full of bugs rather than coins?
Most of my issues with the movie are based on my having read the books rather than on the movie itself (although I do wonder why the girls can't pronounce ""da""!), and the movie can stand on its own--it's that good.  The whole family can enjoy a movie like this together; although the DVD extras do seem to be aimed at the younger portion of the family audience, they are interesting for even adults to watch once.

Perhaps I should have read the books first, so that I could think ""Hey, I remember that from the books!"", but I didn't, so here's an opinion of the movie from a person who is slightly unfamiliar to Samantha.  I think that while some actors were well-cast, others were not.  Samantha, for example, always seemed to have a rather snotty look on her face, and Grandmary seemed more like someone in their late forties instead of an old lady.  The filming was choppy and seemed to be showing bits and pieces from the book instead of blending them in together.  There was no extreme action, possibly because Samantha was never faced with many obstacles to begin with.  Some parts were also
unbelievable.

Some good things were Nellie (she was well-cast), the few funny parts (such as when Samantha and Nellie got a hold of Eddie Ryland's money jar), and the scenery was nice.

Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it definately wasn't as good as I expected, and it's not something I would be willing to pay for.",1103068800,2,1226,4.612903225806452

2166480,4,B00064AMEE,"I am seventy-five years old and a retired English professor who taught children's literature (among other things) for twenty-five years.  This story is a little didactic, but that won't bother most youngsters.  It is somewhat unrealistic in that a nine year old girl could take it upon herself to kidnap three children from an orphanage.  Samantha's instant recognition of abuse in the factory is also a little unbelieveable.  But as Samual Taylor Coleridge said, we must sometimes have a willing suspension of disbelief; that is, it's all right to believe in the goodness of a nine year old child even though some of her actions are hardly credible.

The setting of the film is beautiful, reflecting a romantic idealization of a bucolic America in 1904, when very few wealthy Americans would have taken three poor and orphaned children to their hearts as Samantna and her family do.  More than likely, people then would have had little to do with three immigrant Irish children. Even so, Samantha and her family's kind and loving adoption of the three children is indeed satisfying.

One of the most appealing aspects of the film was the period costumes of the characters, especially the dresses of Samantha and of her grandmother and her aunt.  These beautiful dresses were contrasted with the dresses of the three orphans, helping to give verisimiltude to the wealth of Samantha and her family and to the poverty of the three Irish girls.

Whatever one thinks about its lack of realizm and Samantha's instant crusading, the film overcomes any shortcomings because it furnishes its own ""willing suspension of disbelief"" and pulls us into the setting, characterization, and conflict with pleasure.",1101945600,2,1698,5.079136690647482
2166481,4,B00064AMEE,"A mere week after the premiere of ""Samantha-An American Girl Holiday,"" I may have seen the movie more than anyone in the world. We taped it for our 8-year-old but, while she's at school, our 2-year-old repeatedly asks to watch ""Amackan Girl."" So, watch it we do. This movie is a must see for the American Girl in your household. Technically, it's not particularly good, but your children will not notice the bad acting. Instead, they'll take home the movie's lessons and empathize with the girls in the movie.
Rebecca Mader as Cornelia far and away does the best job of re-creating the character we meet in the books (and her acting is the best in the show). But, poor Mia Farrow doesn't have a chance to embody her book counterpart; screen Grandmary was written as a far less stern (and far younger) presence than print Grandmary. I think the print Grandmary better portrays the way women were in 1904.
So, do yourself a favor: Don't let your children miss this movie, but please read the books!",1101945600,11,996,4.632768361581921

Hot Toasty Rag, September 17, 2017

American Girl dolls were a huge staple of my childhood; I collected seven historical dolls and still keep them on display in my room. I have drawers of outfits and accessories, and virtually my entire closet is full of furniture pieces for them. Cookbooks, games, and novelsand now, in the modern era, there are lots of movies to go along with the historical collection! In Samantha: An American Girl Holiday, Samantha moves in with her grandmother and meets Nellie.

If you know about the dolls, you know Samantha is the Victorian doll, whose story takes place at the turn of the century, and Nellie is her impoverished friend. AnneSophia Robb, in her debut film, gives a great performance as Samantha. Shes a real doll come to life! Mia Farrow plays her grandmother, and its easy to imagine her popping right out of the books illustrations. Of all the American Girl movies, this one is my favorite. Felicitys film is a close second, but this one gives me an extra fuzzy feeling inside because it takes place during Christmas. Dig your dolls out from the atticor take them down from display in your roomand watch this Christmas American Girl delight!",1505606400,,1232,4.806603773584905
