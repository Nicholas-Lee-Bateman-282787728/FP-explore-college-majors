8183766,5,B000O76PW6,"Barely escaping the sacked and burning city of Hsian Yang, Princess Chu Tung-yung, her lady in waiting and their bodyguard Chen (Tien Yeh, Ma Su Chen, Jade Dagger Ninja) must get to the relative safety of General Wang's forces. There they can deliver a cache of hold that will turn the tide of war. But in order to do that they must cross treacherous terrain filled with bandits and rebel forces. Enlisting the unwilling aid of a pair of sword wielding con men the convoy embarks on its journey to save the Princess and defeat the rebels.

With swordplay reminiscent of Zatoichi and Yojimbo, The Last Days Of Hsin Yang is a riveting tale of honor, betrayal and redemption.",1348704000,,672,4.647058823529412
8183767,4,B000O76PW6,"Basically, the cover, the insert, and the description of this item contain some minor errors. The chinese characters of this burning city should be Hsiang Yang or Xiang Yang. Hsian Yang is another city. Not to mention that HSIN Yang is not even close... IT's a typo, I believe. And, it's a typo on the title of this movie. Besides, one actor's name should be Sun YUE, not Sun YEI.

In addition, this movie was made in 1968 rather than 1979. Although the director and most the actors were Taiwanese, this film was issued in Hong Kong first. The traditional Taiwanese chronological expression needs to add 1911 to the original number. For example, the 50th year of the ROC (Taiwan) means 1961. Because this film was issued in Hong Kong, '68 means 1968 rather than 1979.

However, those minor typos do not really matter. This film is starred by leading actors and actresses. The director's works prevailed in Taiwan and some of them were famous in China. The plot is kinda influenced by Kurosawa's the Hidden Fortress. This film is pretty enjoyable, and it shows a different style of the martial arts movies from east Asia.",1232064000,2,1120,4.709183673469388
8183768,4,B000O76PW6,"The film is quite decent -- very interesting for a while, and even compelling in a few spots -- but the disc is pretty bad.  Despite claims of being ""remastered,"" the video looks just like a straight-from-VHS transfer.  In very dark scenes, like in the cave, it's almost unwatchable.  Subtitles are ""burned in"" on the print, and are white, often hard to read and cropped off despite the LBX presentation.  (And I doubt it's anamorphic as claimed on the back cover.)  At least there are chapter stops, twelve of them, and the original trailer is provided, as well as that to another flick, both of which trailers run back-to-back.

The movie was surprisingly enjoyable, though the amazon editorial is in error: for one thing, it's a princess being escorted through enemy territory, not some prince-in-hiding who takes up with a small family.  The story was actually dramatic at times, and I think there was pretty good acting, especially from the two con-men characters.  Those looking for martial arts action won't find much of interest here, though there are the obligatory fights.  The real strength of this film lies in its drama (though it could have been even better with more character development), and it's a shame that more wasn't done to really flesh out the story, instead of attempting some action, which is barely okay, overall....

I bought this in the store for like $15 but I think it's only worth $5-8 (bargain bin prices), considering the video quality, though the movie itself is fairly entertaining.  I'm glad I saw it, and own it.",1183161600,4,1551,4.837121212121212
