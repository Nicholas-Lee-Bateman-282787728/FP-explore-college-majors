8306282,5,B001GNG31U,"Excellent 1950 black and white movie about a small town riddled with alcoholism, like any normal American town or city, and how they get brave and tackle it.  The alcoholics and those who love them.  Shows an era when people were beginning to understand it's a sickness and that the disease needs hospital treatment.  AA also plays an important part.",1484179200,,350,4.8
8306283,4,B001GNG31U,"I'm not sure when ""One to Many"" was made, but for it's time it depicts Alcoholic Anonymous and it's program of recovery, very, very well.
As well, the actress who played the mother did an excellent, and believable job of portraying the real down and out alcoholic. Nothing, not even her daughter, was going to keep her from the bottle...this is the story of many. Well done!",1441497600,,374,4.597014925373134
