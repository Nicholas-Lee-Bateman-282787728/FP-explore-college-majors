2158162,4,B000621452,"Everything was very well explained and demonstrated throughout.  I like the progression of drill sets for two reasons.  First you can work through the items in the 15 min set and get them down pat before proceeding to the 30 min set which builds on them, and so on to the 45 min set.  Also, even when you're familiar with and relatively comfortable with all the moves, you can still go back and do a shorter set if you only have limited time on a given day.

The one thing I really did not like was the way Rachel's performance was edited.  The cuts were, as a previous reviewer said, chaotic, and really detracted from her dancing.  Someday, the world must produce a film editor who understands what a bellydance student wants to see in a performance, which is not an overproduced piece that doesn't let you see all the performer's moves.  I'd rather they kept a steady cam on her with a full-body shot throughout, and perhaps threw in a decorative mirror or two into the set so you could see different angles that way.  If a strobe effect is wanted by the performer, Rachel in this case, do it with lighting, not lightning-fast edits.  Then again, that's my preference in general for bellydance performance videos/dvds.",1110499200,7,1221,4.589861751152074
2158163,4,B000621452,"After waiting what seemed like eons to my eager soul (but which were actually only a few weeks) I finally received my Tribal DVD with Rachel Brice. It had apparently been in production getting some final touches, and the wait has definitely paid off.

The DVD opens with an introduction by Carolena Nericcio, the founder of American Tribal Style Belly Dance. It next moves into some light Yoga, including a few rounds of forward bends and sun salutations.

The lessons on the disk range from hip lifts and drops to body waves both up and down, with small hip circles included, as well as a few other moves.

Rachel starts each movement out slowly, talking you through each step. Gradually the speed of the movement increases, with clear and well directed verbal pointers along the way.

The movements become more difficult and more layered as the disk moves along, with various Yoga poses in between, breaking it up and keeping you flexible.

I enjoyed this DVD. It is great for polishing up the basics, and had a wonderful segment on the upwards body wave which I've never before been able to master. I think it might be challenging at first for a beginner, but a great tool for anyone who dances.

Rachel keeps all the movements controlled and precise, asking you along the way to make the movements muscular and focus on getting the basics down before smoothing out the moves.

There were only two things I didn't really care for on this DVD. One was that in between each move there was a black screen with white letters introducing the coming move. Once I shifted gears and stopped looking at this as a work out and instead as drills as it's advertised I was fine.

Other than that, the music by Pentaphobe was really not to my personal tastes. The drum solos were wonderful however.

The DVD has outtakes by Carolena Nericcio, as well as a 3 minute performance by Rachel. Okay, make that three things I didn't like.. just that the editing on the performance was a little chaotic.

I found Rachel's instructions to be very clear and helpful, but if you don't want to hear them you have the option of watching the DVD without the instruction!

I'm glad I bought this DVD. I can't wait for the sequel!",1109980800,32,2203,4.594387755102041

However - I received this DVD about a month ago. I did not open it until today.  The plastic ""new DVD"" sticker that holds the case closed was already torn, as though the DVD was used (I bought it as a new item). The disc itself is cracked - almost completely in half.  It is, therefore, completely useless.
Of course, it is past the 30 day mark, so I cannot return it.  I'm very sad that I will be unable to watch the DVD, and that I wasted my money.  This is my first negative Amazon experience, and hopefully my last.",1406332800,,628,4.114754098360656
2158207,5,B000621452,"Where has this dvd been all my life? Really, where?!

I purchased Tribal Fusion Belly Dance: Yoga, Isolations and Drills with Rachel Brice because I am a beginning dancer who also enjoys the calm and serene feeling that yoga brings. I had read so many good reviews on this practice companion and after being very dissapointed with Serpentine (also by Rachel Brice-it's nothing against her or the dvd but I just am not advanced or strong enough yet to get anything out of it besides the yoga) I was happy to find that this practice companion is just what I was looking for.

You can break up this workout into 15, 30 or 45 minute sessions. In all honesty, the 15 minute workout was enough to get me sweating. You do work HARD in this DVD. The 15 minute session has yoga at the beginning to warm you up and then Rachel goes into drilling you on hip workouts on the up (I find these to be great fun), body rolls or undulations ( these are extremely challenging for me) and hip workouts on the down (also great fun). The practice concludes with a cool down yoga session.

What I like about this DVD is that the combination of yoga and bellydance will result not only in strength, good posture and endurance, but also in a strong core and defined, toned abdomen. This is exactly what I want in a workout.

15 minutes every day is not a huge commitment, even if you are working full time like I am. For me it is fully worth it to find those extra minutes each day to fit my practice in.

I also really like that with the bellydance moves, Rachel breaks them down and explains them (along with their potential pitfalls) so that even a beginner like myself can follow along and understand how they are supposed to be performed. Her muscle control is such that it helps me see how mine should eventually move. Also, great job on the camera work that shows her feet. Footwork is an important part of any dance routine that is frequently ignored on many other bellydance routines. She does go into doing double time on all the routines; I simply ignore that and do mine at regular speed.

I plan on doing the 15 minute practice every day save weekends, then I will do the 30 minute practice. The dance routine at the end is just plain confusing to watch. I wish it showcased Rachel's entire incredible dancing, not just disjointed bits and pieces. I do LOVE the outfit she chose to wear though. The belt on its own is awesome.",1404259200,7,2415,4.391498881431767

2158260,4,B000621452,"I'm a big fan of Rachel Brice. I'm also a complete belly dance beginner. After reading other reviews of her DVDs, I decided this one was the most appropriate for my skill level of zero! I was right. I am able to do the DVD from beginning to end with Rachel, which makes me feel great as a newbie.

There are many helpful reviews about this DVD, so I'm going to list my favorite aspects:
1) Rachel provides 3 separate routines. 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes. This is SO WONDERFUL for me. It is simple to do the 15 minute before work in the morning and feel like I'm off to a great start. The 2 longer sessions are reserved for days off or when I feel like practicing for fun, which is frequently.
2) Rachel tells you what muscles you should be using, when. This is really important to me as a beginner, because I have no way of knowing! I want to be technically correct, and also safe.
3) The isolations & drills are excellent. Rachel moves through them at the exact pace that I want to. Once I start to want more of a challenge, or at least a change, Rachel does just that. It's a little creepy, how she reads your mind.
4) I like Rachel Brice. I like her calm voice & to-the-point instruction. This is a no-nonsense, concentrated DVD.

I would like to give this 4.5 stars. I would knock off .5 star because I wish there were more content on this DVD. It clocks at 1 hour, 18 minutes, which I think they got by adding up 30+45+3 min performance, leaving off the 15 minute practice. There could be a little more variety for the price, though, when you compare it to other belly dance DVDs.

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1355702400,3,1638,4.27741935483871
2158261,2,B000621452,I love Rachael Brice and thinks she is one of the very best fusion belly dancers. However this video she is very disconnected to the audience. Not only that it lacks a varity of creative moves. It seems as though she is not a very good teacher or she doesn't want to reveal a lot of what she knows. This video is for someone that want to learn a little something. Not for those who want to persue fusion belly dance or take it on as a hobbie.,1355356800,,442,4.034090909090909
2158262,5,B000621452,"Rachel Brice DVDs are clear, both in photography and in her teaching technique. I really appreciate the yoga incorporated with this, since I'm sort of using bellydance as rehab, and the yoga is really helpful.

This got me started in belly dance, now I'v got quite a few other DVDs but this one's still my absolute favorite. It is a lot of yoga and I didn't necessarily learn how to dance from this, it is a practice companion like it says... but it gave me the strength and fluidity that other teachers assume I'v already mastered. I'm not a natural born dancer, but this taught me how to move my hips in ways I never thought possible. The way Rachel breaks down everything down is perfect, she is so clear on exactly how to do each move. The first time I put the DVD in I fell over a few times during the warm up, but I'm so glad I kept at it!!! I used to be slouchy and tense in my shoulders, I love what this has done for my posture! I feel taller and more relaxed. People often comment on the way I carry myself and my confidence, this workout is my secret. Oh, and did I mention that my buff big brothers are jealous of my abs?  :)  I just ordered her other 2 DVDs, I'm so excited to get to work on them.",1339632000,,1133,3.9649122807017543

I knew almost nothing when i first got this tape. I couldn't do a body roll undulation. I couldn't learn it from Amira or Jillina. I didn't have a teacher. I was checking stuff out on you tube. I finally learned how to do it from Rachel on this dvd. This dvd is basic and it's fantastic. Personal attention, go at yr own pace with endless repetitions by the Goddess Herself. I think they did a great job filming this. It feels like she's standing right here next to me. I have Serpentine, too, and I love it. It's like a week long workshop master class, but while even a beginner can get alot out of Serpentine with concentration and practice, this dvd is slower, easier, and totally focussed on  basic fundamentals. This one I keep coming back to, even for 15 minutes at a time, and it's all about correct technique, posture, and breath.

I love the break down in the moves, and it's so much easier to see how things should be done the way that Rachel demonstrates it.  I also love the option to have narration or not.

The only thing I didn't like was the camera work in the performance part of the video.  The drills and practice portion were really well done, and it was disappointing to see the camera work not match in the performance section.  Rachel is so fluid and it's such a pleasure to watch her normally, but I had to turn it off finally because the changes in angle, aspect and direction were so constant, it was jarring, and you really don't get to see Rachel do what she does best.

I'd asked Kami (beautiful dancer, by the way) specifically for something that would be good for a tribal dance beginner.

I have had extensive belly dance experience with Egyptian cabaret and experimented a little with choreography to ""Dead Can Dance"", ""Haunted by Waters"" and ""Loreena McKennitt"" music before tribal was popular and before, for some reason, it turned Goth. I've performed at restaurant venues, fairs and private parties.  But, I have not danced in several years and needed something to get me back into dance form.

This is a wonderful video if you want to see what these women can do.  But it is a completely unrealistic workout.  A contortionist, perhaps?  A 20 year yoga veteran, maybe.  But not, definitely NOT for even intermediate much less a beginner or someone trying to get back into shape....unless you're trying to injure yourself...then it's perfect.  If you do have any injuries or back problems this is one video I wouldn't recommend.  I much prefer Fat Chance Belly Dance vids....they tend to be more realistic.

I'm afraid this is one that's gathering dust on my shelf.  I'm not likely to take recommnedations from Bellydance superstars in the future.

And please, someone tell me, since when did tribal become synonomous with Goth?!  It's not just this video...it's everywhere with Tribal.  Was it because of the Dracula film with Kenau Reeves, Winona Ryder, and Gary Oldman??  I seriously don't understand what the whole ""let's dress in black and try our best to look like Florina Kendrick"" is about...sheesh....",1274572800,3,1734,4.965277777777778

Rachel is an excellent dancer and as a teacher she is also great on showing you how to do the movements and making it easy for you to follow.

I already KNEW the moves she went over, but she helped me understand them on a different level and as a person with occasional motivation problems, I know I can go into autopilot mode and get a good workout. It's about drilling, not about learning. If you're looking for an instructional video, this might not be the one you want. If you're looking for a PRACTICE COMPANION, it's exactly what you want.

2158335,4,B000621452,"I am a beginning dancer & love Brice's interpretations and technical skill.

The video offers several nice features, one of which is the option to choose between 3 different practice lengths.  They are all excellent workouts and will build conditioning, strength, flexibility, and stamina.  Right now I hold steady at the 30 minute workout but hope to build up to the 45 minute one soon.

Although I am a beginning dancer, I have 5 years of yoga experience.  Rachel is an advanced yoga practitioner and does not model modifications of poses for people with injuries or beginners.  I know this is probably because she wanted to focus on dance & taking time to explain modifications would take time away from the dance practice.

She does suggest modifications in the introduction but this is still not effective for beginners to yoga.  That said, since I am not a beginner it causes me no problems & I enjoy the yoga segments.  The segments sometimes don't transition well between one another.  For example, one yoga segment ends with a standing pose and the next begins with a floor position.  This is no big deal though.

The dance approach parallels the yoga approach.  Her instruction is clear but I think the viewer needs a solid foundation in basic ballydance vocabulary and movement before he or she can integrate Rachel's highly muscular interpretations.

For example she does an ""inner hip circle"" which is intitiated by highly controlled abdominal contractions.  If you are a dancer coming to the video with no knowledge of a standard hip circle, you might have difficulty layering the general pelvic movement with contractions.  Or, at least I did.  I feel almost all of her moves are layered, and therefore relatively advanced.  It seems like the movements of bone structures are intiated and layered with muscular contractions & this is very difficult!  That said, the beginning bellydancer who has experience with yoga and is getting a foundation through another source like classes or another video should be just fine.  Rachel's video easily compliments a foundational practice for the beginner and can stand on its own for the more experienced.  I am using Waverly Fitzgerald's ""Beautiful Technique"" video to help me grasp a technical foundation of basic moves.

Rachel never fails to inspire me & her performance on the video is 100% awesome.  If I may, though, I'd like to say that the video producers really screwed up her perfomance by using silly and jolting camera transitions.  I suppose they thought this would heighten the drama of her performance.

Dear BellyDanceSuperstar video people: Rachel does just fine in communicating beauty, passion, and dark intensity through dance.  She does not need weird camera techniques to do this for her.  In fact, you kind of got in the way of her stunning performance.  So, just let her do her thing next time.

If I were an intermediate dancer I would easily give this video 5 stars.  But for a beginner, I rate it 4 for the reasons listed above.

I'm off to stretch my quadriceps so that maybe one day I can do superhuman floor work like Rachel.  Happy dancing.",1234656000,4,3127,4.897142857142857
2158336,3,B000621452,"I bought this DVD earlier today and was eager to try it out when I got home and got the privacy to work out.

This DVD was enthusiastically recommended to me by a good friend; in fairness, she did warn that it wouldn't be an easy workout and I was ready for that. However, after doing the 30 minute workout, I felt like there should be (or have been) a DVD out that precedes this one for people who are newbs to belly dancing and yoga, or at the very least a section of the DVD that discusses those need-to-know things for people unfamiliar with tribal belly dance and yoga. Brice's instructions on what to move where and how are concise and I appreciate that...but I still felt like there was something I was missing in the course of the drills. Now that I've done the workout and have had some time to reflect on it, I can't say that I would recommend this to someone as a buy-it-first DVD. Also, I felt that sometimes things moved a bit too fast and I was left scrambling, trying to simultaneously figure something out and catch up.

I really don't mind the drills. I know I suck at them now but I also know that they will be incredibly useful to me in the future. The camera angles and movements during the drills was quite lovely; between the shots of her whole body working and the close-up shots of the specific parts that were working for a move, you get a really good sense of what parts are to be doing what movement. The yoga cool-down was wonderful too after all of those drills.

Also, I agree with a few other reviewers; I wish she would smile or at least grin a few times! I felt like I was watching a stern school-marm. For me, I've noticed that if the person in the DVD looks relaxed and like they're having a good time, I'm more likely to be relaxed and enjoy what I'm doing. Rachel looks pretty cold and tense the whole time...so I was too :(",1233792000,2,1861,4.236619718309859
2158337,3,B000621452,"I like this DVD.  So far, I've found that most conventional belly dance DVD's don't offer many drills (in fact, I've discovered ""drilling"" is a dirty word in some belly dance circles).  This is the first one I've found which offers reasonably long drills of single movements.  For me, it's a good DVD to play when I don't want to think about choro, but just want a good workout of my abdominal muscles.

That said, a lot of each warmup is actually yoga rather than belly dance moves, and I did feel that some people could get into trouble trying to emulate the fairly advanced yoga moves she uses.

It also includes a very nice solo by Rachel.

These are drills, as stated, and they are good drills.  Practicing this DVD regularly has helped my control as a dancer.  I have two complaints.

1.)  There is only 40 minutes of instruction, not 78.  Both the 15 minute practice and the 30 minute practice contain the same moves as the 40 minute practice.  They are recorded end to end, 15 min., 30 min, 40 min, and her performance at the end, to equal 78 minutes.

2.)  This doesn't contain much of Rachel Brice's signature dance style.  This is a foundation DVD.  It will help you build up to the amazing control that Rachel Brice has.  This will not teach you her moves, but this will help you do basic moves with wonderful precision, power, and poise, like Rachel Brice.

Honestly, if I didn't feel that the repetition of the moves in the 3 practices was so cheap, I would give her 5 stars.  This is a really good DVD for honing your skills as a dancer.",1225670400,5,968,4.305555555555555

I'm not a huge Yoga fan (way too impatient!) and a lot of time is devoted to that. The drills and isolations are awesome and I frequently use this DVD as a reference because Rachel does a great job explaining everything. I have been bellydancing for about 2 1/2 years and I teach a beginner bellydance class, so for me this DVD was too basic.

I also didn't like the fact that they have locks on the down on the 30 minute workout and not on the 45...what gives? Did they not pay attention when they made the dvd?

Rather than a workout companion...this film is more likely a workout/practice hinderance.  It is highly ineffective and uninspiring in its application to actually practicing.

I find it one of the less engaging productions in my library...and believe me. I have more than a few dance films!  Some people are awesome dancers.  She certainly is.
Some people are awesome teachers  (I really think she has this inside of her as well)  but maybe rarely is a person both.  Brice is beautiful and graceful in her performances  but here as a teacher, in this production she seems cold, uninterested  not engaging or connecting with her 'students'.  It feels like I am intruding upon someone's private time and find it hard to watch.

I found myself sorting laundry or reorganizing my bookshelves every time I have tried to watch and follow this video. I don't want to do yoga. I want to dance and bask in the wisdom and amazing skill in this teacher!  I want this teacher to talk to us, share, show and lead us--interact.  She's all dressed up in her amazing costume, inviting you from the cover to come dance with her, workout and dance with this pro.

I was a bit disappointed.  It wasn't what I was expecting.  I didn't get the usual sisterhood sort of sharing that usually exudes from other teacher's productions.  It seemed sterile; the antithesis to the overzealous, unqualified teacher selling her kitchen floor dance debut after her first week of lessons.  She is the iconic brand new happy student:)  hence we can forgive the misguided enthusiasm that led her to sell her home movie mislabeled as instructional.

I have found a new appreciation for this DVD now that I can follow along with the opening yoga sequences. I'd still advise caution to those that are new to yoga or are not very flexible, but now I love them!

On to the isolations and the breakdown of them... I LOVE IT! They are broken down at a slow pace, then the pace is quickened. Most especially in the undulations, and the hips on the down. She has possibly the best breakdown and explanation of hips on the down that I've seen. Made it easy for me to follow that step in my class.

Some may gripe that Rachel Brice is too skinny, but the one advantage to her being as toned as she is, you can SEE how the muscles are supposed to move in these isolations. She is thin, graceful and toned, not emaciated looking at all.

And the performance she does on this DVD? Beautiful! She is so fluid and graceful. Makes all the moves look effortless.

I recommend this if you are looking to improve and sharpen hip and undulation moves, but don't get it if you are looking for something that focuses on choreography.",1203811200,3,1238,4.233050847457627

This is mainly for strengthening and relaxing your important muscles and only a few actual basic belly dance moves are drilled (hip drops, hip circles, chest lifts, and rolls) but they are very important moves to be drilled!

Don't look for much excitement though, as it is simply Rachel, a mirror, and her voice narrating the movements. Personally, I like that in an instructional video...I believe it's clear, the music isn't too loud or invasive, and it's a must have for any belly dancer of any level.

2158371,5,B000621452,"I feel that some of these less-than-favorable reviews are a little unfair...it's a DRILLS DVD, people! It's not fair to say that the DVD is boring and repetitious...that's what drills are: repeatedly working the muscles you need to improve your performance. I've said this on a previous review: if you take ballet, how many thousands of plies and releves do you have to do? That's not very exciting, either, but it is entirely necessary to the very heart of ballet.

Okay...preaching over. ;)

I haven't owned this DVD long at all, but already I can tell a difference in my performance. All those repetitions create muscle memory...in other words, you don't have to think about what you are doing...your body already knows. It becomes instinctive. The yoga, too, is wonderful for toning and stretching the very specific muscles needed for belly dance. I take a weekly belly dance class and a drills class with a wonderful instructor...however, twice a week is really not enough if you are serious about dancing. If you ARE serious about dancing, I think this is an excellent DVD to prep your muscles: not only to dance better but also to protect yourself from injury.

I also disagree with some of the complaints about the quality of the video itself. I thought the set was fine (for $14.98, I don't expect the quality of MTV) and I thought the camera angles were terrific. Rachel performs the isolations in front of a mirror so you can see both the front and the back of the movement. The camera also views from the side and close ups on the muscle being worked. You are able to see every side and angle of the isolations and asanas...which made it clear to understand and to replicate.

I only have two small complaints: I'm not sure this DVD should be marketed for all levels. I've practiced yoga off and on for years, so I was able to dive right in. I think it would be nice, however, if there was a small introduction for total newbies with an explanation of breathing and some other general information...and maybe some tips on variations for those who aren't quite ready for some of the asanas (they aren't supposed to be easy and they're not). Easier yet, I think it could be marketed for beginner-intermediates on up.

The second complaint is totally trivial: Smile, Gorgeous! You don't have to grin like the village idiot, but show that you're having a good time. Trust me; people will still take you seriously.

Still, I'm giving this DVD 5-stars because of its effectiveness. Thanks, Rachel! I'm buying your second DVD, too!",1194134400,7,2536,4.713318284424379

I did not find it hard to do but I have had 2 months of bellydance classes, and own several bellydance dvds.

The drills are good but you don't get much for your money as each section is the same as before and timings include yoga.

I watched the intro and it looked so promising - Rachel is an amazing dancer and her yoga form is good - and I loved the idea of having 15, 30 and 45 minute workouts. Alas, there was little substance to the actual workouts. Even the 45 minute practice was dreary and disjointed - a couple of yoga poses (sun salutations with lunge - very hard the way Rachel does them, then straight into locust pose), a few bellydance drills and then a couple of yoga stretches at the end. In the intro, Rachel is shown doing pigeon pose, bow pose and another backbend. Where were these in the workouts?

Like many other reviewers, I agree that this one is a nice little extra thing to do outside of class or in tandem with other workouts.

2158397,5,B000621452,"Ok so I have to admit that I am a big Rachel Brice fan and thats only because she has fantastic control over her body has an intriguing stage presence. I might be slightly biased since I am mesmerized by her dancing, but I think that even if I had no clue who she was this video would still be fantastic. I will try to give an unbiased review of this video. First off, I would not recommend this video for a total novice. Nor would I recommend this video to someone looking for a video that shows a variety of moves beacuse you won't find that here. However, I would recommend this video to someone who is looking to gain core strength, and gain better control over specific moves, especially undualtions. That is exactly why I bought this video, to gain core strength and for a better breakdown of the body undultaion. Rachel Brice is the queen of body undulations and it shows in this video. She only covers hip locks and drops, undulations on the up and down, chest lifts and drops, rib cage figure eights, and omis or inner hip circles (I might be forgetting some since this is off the top of my head). But the instruction of these simple moves is solid. She spends about 5 minutes and sometimes more on each move starting off by breaking the move down into single muscle contractions then smoothing everything out slowly and eventually speeding everything up. My only complaint about this video is the camera movement and angles! It moves too often and sometimes does not show Rachel's entire body so you can't always see what her feet or legs are doing. From doing this video I have improved my hip locks and drops so much, even my class instructor noticed and told me that the video was working wonders on me. I absolutely love the warm up for this video (a short series of sun salutations). Even when I don't practice with this video I still use the warm up. Overall this is a great video for isolations and drills (which is exactly what the title says it is). Just be forwarned that this video is not a ""how to bellydance"" video, so it is not for total novices.",1175126400,9,2070,4.407310704960835
2158398,2,B000621452,"it has a few drills for chest and hip movement, and some yoga, but there isn't much explination of either.

I use this in tandem with the Beginers East Coast Tribal Belly Dance DVD with Sera and it works well.  Only because I did yoga for a long time, so I understand some of their rather sparse explinations.

I would recomend this if you take lessons regularly, have taken lessons and need something to help you build strength or work out a bit, or do yoga or have taken yoga and are getting into some of the belly dance motions or want to start belly dancing with an instructor or a DVD but not alone.  The explinations are quick, not explaining the poses very well, and the DVD moves very fast without any flow.  one minute your on the floor in childs pose then there is a screen transition and your supposed to be standing up and wiggling your hips, its very disjointed.  Still I like it, supplimented with something else.

also, Rachel doesn't smile at all, which bothers me... nor does she talk there is a voice over... so its a little weird hehe",1175126400,2,1053,4.369230769230769

2158414,5,B000621452,"After having watched about 21 bellydance instructional dvd's of all types, I was thrilled to find this one. Rachel shows proper technique on both yoga and bellydance drills - this is very important and very rare in the instructional bellydance (and yoga) dvd realm. New students to yoga and bellydance buy other dvd's and have no idea they are being taught improper technique that will lead to physical problems. It is great to see Rachel knows her stuff and shares the knowledge she has gathered. Her voice is calm and supportive, her instruction is clear. I certainly hope she will make another dvd with tribal fusion instruction - she is a great teacher.",1173312000,3,657,4.823008849557522

2158416,4,B000621452,"I have studied American Tribal Style Dance on-and-off for about 7 years now, and had a very intense 2 year study of straight Egyptian-style Cabaret some years before that.  I also do yoga regularly.  This DVD offers good exercises that would complement studio study.  Often during a studio ""lesson"" you'll be working on a routine or improv and won't have time to dedicate to intense study of isolations.  This DVD gives you ample time to consider exactly what your body is doing, and to guide yourself without having to ""keep pace"" with other students.  Rachel's narration is clear and helpful, and as a student returning to dance after some months of a break, I found the pacing to be perfect.  More advanced students may get bored.

As far as criticisms go, I would ask for a couple of extra items:

1.  A small stretching break between isolations to open the knees/ankles (as simple as a couple of rolls or twists w/each knee/ankle prior to the start of the next isolation) as a way to strengthen these joints and prevent fatigue.  My reccomendation to the viewer would be to pause the DVD and do them.

2.  Something for the arms and hands.  Expressive, fluid movement of arms and hands is paramount to a fine dancer, and I'm surprised she doesn't make an offering for development of these muscle groups.

3.  During the Cool-down:  offer some folded-leg stretches and forward bends (w/legs together) to open the hip and the lower back, and possibly some twists.  Again, viewers, for your health, push ""pause"" and add these in - you'll be happier in the morning!

All-in-all a fine practice session, just not complete in and of itself.",1171756800,10,1639,4.731448763250883

I know bellydancers that swear by her, but I didn't find the instruction that overwhelmingly educational.

Based on the 15-minute yoga workout, I think this will be valuable for teaching me the isolation exercises and helping me develop a fitness routine. As I advance, I have every confidence that the longer workouts will also be helpful. With that in mind, I think this was worth the money I paid.

Having said that, I'll say that others' reviews about the spastic editing were right on.  The ""performance"" is very disappointing.  Don't even think you'll be able to pick up technique from this, because the camera angle changes too abruptly and at too strange times.  If you want to see how Rachel does her Tribal Fusion thing, look elsewhere.  The outtakes section seems to be there more because people expect it than for any entertainment value.

If this had been my first purchase of a bellydance performance tape, it would have been my last.  I'm glad I started with ""Solos from Monte Carlo"" so I know that good tapes exist.",1168214400,3,1057,4.763736263736264

2158434,5,B000621452,"This video is great for practice and conditioning.  It was meant as a COMPANION to classes NOT as a class itself.  The YOGA exercises and isolation drills are meant to condition your body for Tribal Bellydance, and condition they will!  My only ache with this video is the performance segment.  It jumps around way too much for my taste.  Since the art is such a full body expression I'd have preffered to view a more complete, continuous flow of performance rather than the chopped and edited version on this video.  Rachel Brice is excellent and does a great job explaining exactly how to do the isolations/ poses.  I love that her voice is narrating the video (rather than her speaking as she executes each exercise).  It makes it easier to understand and follow.  I love that it is broken up into 15, 30 & 45 minute practice sessions.  I take a bellydance class once a week and since I began supplementing with this video I feel and see a dramatic improvement and ease in my dancing.  I HIGHLY Recommend this for those serious about learning the art.",1167696000,2,1054,4.5828877005347595
2158435,4,B000621452,"Billed as a ""practice companion,"" this disk is exactly that. It is not an introduction to tribal style, a bellydance overview, or any kind of stand-alone instruction for someone trying to learn on their own. Professional dancers, people with dance training, and yoga students will get a tough workout and a lot of instruction in making small, finely controlled movements, so if that's what you want, this is the DVD for you.

The DVD says it will help dance students ""regardless of level"" - and it will. But it misses the distinction between a dance student, someone with a dance background and a basic level of fitness and flexibility, and a beginner with no kinetic training or specific bellydance knowledge. Brice's swan-necked dancer's build and hyperflexible extensions graphically illustrate each position and move. But there are no modifications given for people who can't achieve those full poses. I don't think I even *have* some of those muscles.

I knew it was a DVD for people more advanced than I am, so I'm not lowering the rating on that score. The biggest disappointments for me were:

1. the complete lack of arm instruction - all drills focus on the ribs, hips and belly. (ETA: Since I wrote this review, she released another DVD focusing on arms.)

2. the lack of explanation of what makes a move or sequence of moves ""tribal,"" and the lack of any specifically ""tribal"" moves. All of the moves in this disk can be found on other bellydance dvds.

3. the too-short, badly produced performance piece. For a purchased DVD, I expected more than a 3:10 segment marred by obtrusive stage props and choppy editing. The only benefit was that you could really see Brice's tiny, detailed muscle movements and the costume construction. But there was *no* footwork, very little fire, and no three-dimensional movement. You can find better Brice performance clips for free on youtube.

Brice is a fantastic dancer, and I can't understand the paucity of the performace piece. Where are the bellydance DVDs that have this kind of closeup focus on performance details, coupled with an actual, extended, start-to-finish performance??? I really, really hope she releases another video that addresses this lack.",1167609600,5,2211,4.994565217391305
2158436,5,B000621452,"This video was an impulse buy for me at a bookstore.  I watched the DVD the same day and was thrilled!  The belly dancing techniques were broken down well and the dancer moved very slowly when the voice-over was instructing, making it easy to see what muscles she was contracting and releasing on each move.  The yoga before and after the belly dance section made me feel more limber and helped condition my muscles for the fluid movement required for this type of dance.  Some reviewers suggested there was too much Yoga.  Well, the 45 minute routine has 10 min yoga warm-up, 20 min Belly Dancing drills, and 10 min yoga cool down.  The other five minutes were for relaxation.  To me this combination felt right, so maybe it's just a matter of preference.

I must note that there is no actual ""dancing"" instruction on the DVD, just movement drills.  You stand in one spot for the duration of the drills.  This is all about fine-tunning and improving your technique.  It does not cover all Belly Dancing moves, but I did feel that it covered the ones that are most difficult to master for beginners.  I myself am new to Belly Dancing, and after carefully following this video my entire abdomen felt like it was on fire.  If you are careful to contract and release your ab and back muscles as shown, this makes for one heck of a workout.  Of coarse you can only do your best to mimic what you see on the screen...the first time I followed the DVD my body moved nothing like the professional dancer.  This was ok, since after only a few sessions I could see great improvements in my body's ability to produce the fluid (but difficult) motion.

This is a great companion to any cardio Belly Dancing DVD.  You will be able to get more out of the cardio because you will be performing the movements more accurately.  Executing accurate Belly Dance motions at a fast pace is far more challenging than doing your best to follow the jirations of professional Belly Dancers.",1167177600,4,1965,4.54985754985755
2158437,5,B000621452,"I take several belly dancing classes from different styles and instructors. The dancers that I am mesmerized most have incredible belly isolations and core strength. Rachel breaks down the isolations in three workouts (15, 30, 45 mins) allowing you to really focus on the lower belly movements. She incorporates the whole core body in isolated movements. I have already seen definition in my core abs by practicing five minutes a day, as Rachel recommends. As previously mentioned, she is an incredible dancer. Her greatness is she doesn't focus on her in this DVD, she focuses on transferring pure technique to you! She puts the Belly back into Belly Dancing.",1166745600,2,660,5.064220183486238
2158438,5,B000621452,"I bought this video and am really enjoying it so far. I have no dance experence of any type, but the instructions were pretty easy to follow. Each yoga pose, or belly dance technique is broken up into seperate sections and repeated a few times. Its nice because the repetition actually helps you to get the hang of the move. I also like that its broken into sections so at the end of a section its easy to pause and work on whatever technique a little more on your own. The dvd is also pretty fun. Its different then the boring sit ups, crunch, push ups routine, so I think its a lot more likely I will use it consistantly. However a word of warning, it is not the most challenging or exausting workout. If thats what your looking for this is not what you need. Also The dvd only teaches a few bellydacing techniques. It doesn't really show you how to put it all together into actual dance. It seems like if you want to learn to bellydance its more of an addition rather then the main way to learn. I'm actually planing on buying another video to get a little more instruction.  However it is a great dvd and worth the money.",1165449600,2,1125,4.257009345794392

If you're still looking to learn more about tribal fusion and can't find a local teacher, Sera's  ""East Coast Tribal""  DVD may be the better choice.  I acquired this video because my current teacher recommended it for drills, and that's what I use it for.  In that regard, the combination of yoga and drills seem to work well, though it can be disconcerting to watch the first time through and not know whether you're supposed to already be lying on the floor or standing.  The camera work for the performance segment is almost painful to endure.  I know that Brice is a good dancer, but the choppiness of the film editing does a good job to obscure that fact.

Overall, for the price, if you just want a video to help you stretch and do drills to, this will work for you.  Otherwise, if you want more instruction and choreography, you will be better off looking elsewhere.",1164412800,7,1027,4.508108108108108

2158452,5,B000621452,"Overall a great DVD that I use regularly to practice severe isolations and locks.  Boy do I get a work out! I can dance for two hours in class and feel great. This DVD I start to sweat and gas within 15 minutes! Each drill tells you what you will be doing so you can practice or skip the scene to the next drill. I review the belly dance movements more than the yoga, but I really appreciate the combonation of both as it reminds me I need to stay (and become) flexible for dance.

Rachel Brice's movements are so fluid I get inspired to become better and practice more often. I don't recommend this for early begginners, as the poses and movements are very structured and require some previous experience. I practice this in front of a mirror to get them a close to correct as I can and review them over and over. I have to say it has made me work harder and become better.

You can choose between 15, 30 and 45 minute exercises. They are just longer versions of each other, I would prefer they were three different levels of drills. That's one draw back.

Also the preformance (as I have read in other reviews and have to agree) is choppy. She is so fluid and the editing is cut and chopped for ""artistic"" effect. It's also very short. I would rather see more instuction and performance than the intro, merchandising and outtakes.

This DVD should be part of a series! It's like they give you a taste and when I looked for more of the same I couldn't find any.

I would buy any DVD with Rachel Brice in it. I have many DVD's for practice and this is the one I use most often. I highly recommend.",1159228800,7,1597,4.2368421052631575

Sometimes I've enjoyed this DVD as much as attending one of the MANY American Tribal style Belly dance classes I've been to in the San Francisco Bay Area. Rachel is beautiful and amazing as ever. She breaks down the movements easily and completely so those who are new to belly dance can understand and enjoy the movements of the dance clearly and comprehensively. Wonderful drills for the experienced and accomplished belly dancer as well.,1155513600,,487,5.0246913580246915

It is not so difficult that it can't be done by a complete beginner and it is good drill practice for someone who is a bit further along.  I especially like the 3 practices set up for different lengths of time - the 15 minute one has come in handy on days when I am short of time.

I did NOT like the performance piece, mainly because the camera jumped around too much for me to see what Rachel was doing.  It got irritating after about 30 seconds!  Since I did not purchase this for a performance, I am not including my opinion of it in the review rating.

I started with the 15 min option, and she launches right into sun salutations with warrior pose that is not fully explained at all... thanks goodness I had been doing yoga previously or I would be totally lost. She did not include any warm-up prior to this and I feel like even I, with yoga experience, could have gotten injured just starting with the DVD and not warming up first. Also she is super limber, and does not give instructions for the less-flexible of us to modify some of the poses (for some she does but breezes right through so fast you might not catch it as a beginner.) The bellydance moves are well explained but I also feel these were a little rushed and she could have explained things like her dance posture and such a little better.

The isolations break down the movements so that they're easy to understand and pick up, unlike some other bellydance workouts that briefly go over it then leave you copying it with improper technique.  Rachel breaks down extremely difficult movements like undulations much better than other tapes, my technique went from average to my own personal best.  What I love about how she drills out the movement is that it actually begins to develop 'muscle memory' which is one of the problems in most bellydance workouts...they don't review the movement enough so that the muscles become adjusted and it then can become second nature.  As for the the yoga I found that it really complements the bellydancing in that it builds strength in the buttocks and the back as well as flexibility all which contribute to the fluidity that you see in her dancing.  I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone looking to discover bellydance, or improve their technique, it added more sensuality to my own dancing that wasn't there before I used this workout.",1151884800,12,1155,4.842639593908629

The practice sessions are not described as a workout or dance lesson, but A Practice Companion, which describes this DVD perfectly.  I cannot imagine a more skilled or effective instructor, and await the day that I can pursue real life lessons with Ms. Brice with great anticipation.  Until then, I will continue practicing every day.  Like another reviewer, I eagerly await Volume Two!!  </font>",1146614400,2,799,5.015151515151516
2158496,4,B000621452,"Since the title of the DVD says ""belly dance,"" I guess I expected the same type of dancing shown in the other bellydance videos I own. I realize that I probably didn't really understand what ""drills"" were at the time, since we don't use that term in class. This DVD teaches some bellydance moves but focuses more on bodywork that will help you develop the muscles and flexibility needed to perform the moves at the highest level possible.

The reason I don't rate this one five stars is due to a safety issue. I have a background in fitness and have practiced yoga for 9 years. The warm-ups in the 15 and 30 minute sessions are not nearly long enough, and I prefer to hold my asanas (stretches) for much longer. Some other videos, such as Jillina's and Atea's Magical Motion caution the viewer to also do their own warm-up. Rachel might have done better to add this as well. Second, Rachel goes right into full forward folds as though it is assumed that everyone who buys the DVD has yoga experience. Basic cautions to start with knees bent if necessary, use the legs and not the back to come up and never force anything are not stressed. Someone with poor flexibility and no yoga background - or common sense - could really injure themselves. Some of us have body proportions that prevent us from getting our heads to touch our knees or shins; for instance, I have long legs and a short torso, so it's not likely that my forward fold will ever look like Rachel's, but it's still a forward fold.

Otherwise - it's great. The drills are challenging but as a new dancer I have learned a lot from Rachel about form.  And my hips are building up  - which is one of my goals.

All three practice sessions alternate between yoga and isolations. The yoga develops flexibility and the stretches help prevent injury by loosening the muscles before and after drills. The drills are isolation techniques for the hips and rib cage. If you pay attention to the visual of Rachel doing the drills, you will be more conscious of keeping these areas isolated.  You'll be strengthening your legs in the process and working on being conscious of your posture. Undulations/body rolls are also included. This DVD is a workout that teaches bellydance isolation techniques rather than dance. The strength and flexibility you'll develop will give you the body you need to improve your bellydance skills. I mainly use DVD's to develop my dance movements, not so much as a ""workout.""  This will probably be the only one I'll ever use when I do want to feel like doing more of a workout.

I love the way that you can choose the length of the practice, especially since this is a very challenging workout. Anyone can find the time to do 15 minutes - and if you find it challenging  you can start with 15 minutes and build up to the longer workout instead of becoming discouraged. It took me about two months of practice to be able to do the hipwork at double-time and to do it without getting winded halfway through - and the drills are not that long! You can also play the 45 minute workout and just skip to the drills and stretches you want or need to do. You can even do them more than once if you'd like since the format makes it very easy to skip around. I suggest always starting with the 45 minute practice since it's the only one with a decent warm-up.

The music and brief performance are good and Carolena's outtakes are hilarious. It's a valuable learning and practice tool, but use with caution.

It has helped me make my movements more muscular and less skeletal.  at this point I am learning only by videos, and this video taught me how to do an undulation.  Veena and Neena did not cut it for me with undulations.

I have one major caveat about the video...as a Christian, I found the idol in the background offensive.  However, as it located on the side of the screen, a piece of paper covered it nicely, and I don't have to look at it and feel like I am performing for some other god.  :-)

2158503,5,B000621452,"I bought this with the impression it'd be an instructional DVD for tribal fusion.  I was utterly wrong, and at first, I hated this DVD.

Then I spoke to Rachel, who said it came out differently than what she had in her head, and that she wishes more emphasis had been placed, in marketing, on the fact it's a practice companion.  It is a complement to your yoga and your drills, and goes deeper into them than many of us probably would on our own.

She is utterly correct, and if you look at the DVD with that mindset, it is fantastic.

I am a Roma/ATS dancer, and I find it invaluable in its 15, 30, and 45 minute workouts, for both warming up before I practice my isolations and for deepening my backbends and my rib cage isolations.

If you are a yoga enthusiast, you may find this too easy.  If you are highly schooled in dance, and have a very keen body awareness, you may become bored with this.

But for those of us who have a day job, and dance, and have a household, this is perfect to make you concentrate on making sure you take  the time to do yoga, which is so important to the dance, and stretch.  The time segments make it perfect to fit in at all times of the day as well.

I also give her credit for showing the modifications, albeit quickly and silently, for those who may not be able to reach the floor, or who may have limited motion.

I am hoping she will release one of stretches and yoga for the back, but this, added to your own practice, will make noticeable improvements in all of your moves.",1140998400,3,1518,4.196551724137931

2158515,4,B000621452,"I had read reviews on this video and for quite a while could not make up my mind to buy it or not. Finally I decided that the price was good so what could it hurt. As it turns out I was pleasantly surprised.

I was leary because some reviews said there was very little technique and too much yoga. I found this to be not so true. There is yoga, as it says in the title, for warm up and cool down, but plenty of technique in between. True, the technique is basic but demonstrated and described so clearly that I was able to get more precision on most of these moves that after 10 years of dancing I was just ""pretty good"" at. Undulations were never my stong point, but quite obviously they are one of hers!

I happen to like gothic music and dancing so I don't have that same complaint as another reviewer,but I also don't feel that it had any strong gothic overtones.

I do agree that it was VERY frustrating watching the performance section with all the editing and not being able to see Rachel's beautiful dancing, since it is her technique that I am watching for in the first place, and not really able to see in the performance. That was the biggest, and maybe only, reason I didn't give 5 stars.

I don't really care if she looks bored or not during the instruction section. I was not looking for a cheerleader, but good focused instruction, and I found just that with this video. Not to mention that with yoga included with the drills and instruction, the whole pace of the video seemed very consistent and her facial expressions appropriate to the serene and focused mood.

I have tons of videos too and many of them are part 2 and 3 from the same dancer, so I too am hoping that Rachel will have another video out that will go over her fantastic arm work.

I read another review that said all of the good reviews of this DVD are from Rachels friends and fans. I cannot say weather or not that is true, but I assure you that I have never met Rachel, she doesn't know I exist, and although I DEFINATELY enjoy her dancing and technique, I am not on her mailing list or part of her fan club or whatever else may give the impression that I am biased in those ways.

So although so many videos are really just a review of basic moves, it's seems to me not so strange that this one is too. I find that what makes this one unique is the clear breakdown of undulations, and many other moves, in a no-nonsense fashion. Oh and, holy crap, my abs feel good after the drills!!!  I'm glad I got this DVD. If Rachel ever puts out another one (or more) I will certainly not hesitate to buy next time.",1136505600,67,2592,4.222222222222222

I showed my copy to my Tribe and none of them liked it either. Sorry Rachel.",1135987200,7,362,3.6538461538461537
2158517,2,B000621452,"I am a huge fan of Rachel Brice's dancing, and I fully expected to love this DVD.  It does have its good points.  I like how she explains the yoga exercises.  The length of each of the dance drill demonstrations is great.  Also, I love the music.

However, I take issue with most other aspects of the DVD.  Following are my two main gripes.

First of all, the title being ""Tribal Fusion,"" I had hoped to learn movements specific to Rachel Brice's unique style of dance.  What she demonstrates are very basic belly dance movements that, while very useful to drill, do not expand my vocabulary or enrich my dancing style.  I would have loved to learn about arm movements or travelling steps.  Additionally, she looks bored through much of the footage, and does not once crack a smile!  While a relatively small detail, it adds to my disappointment.

Secondly, the performance secion was particularly disappointing because of the wacky editing.  When I watch a dance performance, I want to see the dance.  The editing on this DVD is incredibly choppy, which kills the performance.  Instead of being able to watch Rachel's amazing quality of movement, the many, many short shots effectively make it into a montage of still shots.  This is very frustrating.  Rachel does not need any fancy editing... even just one long shot of her performing would suffice.

While I'm not sure how much editing power Rachel had over this DVD as it is produced by Belly Dance Superstars/Ark 21, I hope this endeavor is a learning experience for her so that her next DVD is better!",1135641600,19,1558,4.707407407407407

This is a introduction to the world of bellydancing so you don't have to have any background or experience in the subject.

If you're looking for an evenings entertainment hoping to see beautiful women dancing gracefully and seductively in exotic customs this is not the DVD for you.

It isn't an exercise video, it is a practice video.  Rachel Brice explains the moves clearly and they are also clearly shown...which seems to be hard to come by.  Not only is the camera work good, but I swear Rachel Brice has control of EVERY single muscle in her body so you can really tell which muscle you should be isolating.  The only downside for me is that there are not too many moves on this. But I don't know why I'm complaining (too eager to immerse myself utterly, I guess) because my quads get so tired from standing in the standard dance posture that I'm constantly stopping to shake my legs out!!  It's a workout for sure, but it's also wonderful for getting some drills on basic (a couple not so basic) moves.  I'd give her more stars if I could!!

Though you do learn a few Belly Dance moves, this is not an instructional video.  I feel that the people who were disappointed in the video, ordered it for the wrong reasons.

If you are new to Belly Dance, or returning to the dance after a stint away, and would like to strengthen and train your muscles to dance.  Or if you're just looking for a GREAT workout for your core area, then this is the DVD for you.  If you're looking for instructions on how to Belly Dance, or if you are an experienced practitioner, then this is probably not the video to go with.

The camera work when Rachael does her dance is unfortunate if you're hoping to watch a Belly Dance performance - I feel that Belly Dance should be mesmerizing, and the flashiness of the camera work and editing of this piece is far to distracting for that.  However, if you watch it as a way to hype yourself up for the work-out, then it is just energetic enough to do that.

The camera work of the instructional part of the video is perfect though, and I really appreciated the mirror effect of it.  All to often, an instructor is facing you, moving her right side, and telling you to move yours, which just doesn't feel natural.  You end up either moving your right while she says left, or watching her move what feels like your left while she says right.  That isn't the case in this video, and therefore, I was able to focus on the moves, and not rights and lefts.

I have been doing yoga for quite a while, but I see no reason a beginner couldn't do the Yoga moves.  Some reviewers have said the Yoga was too short, but I feel they are missing the point.  It's a Yoga/Belly Dance video, and the two are worked hand in hand, and not as separate entities.

I got exactly what I bought it for, and i'm extremely pleased!",1131926400,9,2052,4.263565891472868
2158537,4,B000621452,"This is a nice workout if your goal is to loosen up before dancing or if you just want to increase flexibility.  You should have some dance background, not necessarily belly dance. Rachel Brice models and explains good form but unless you recognize what does and doesn't feel right you could injure yourself. This is a very short workout.  I gave it only 4 stars because I kind of felt jipped that the 45 min workout included 10 min of corpse pose! This is a very inexpensive DVD and I guess you get what you pay for. In sum, this is a good full body stretch with essential belly dance isolations.  I enjoyed the workout and I will certainly use it again and again.",1131235200,,665,4.346774193548387

2158539,5,B000621452,"Rachel Brice is inspirational to me so I waited anxiously for this DVD to arrive in the mail.  Then I read other reviews and became nervous that perhaps maybe I didn't make a good purchase.

Finally, the DVD came.  I practiced the 15 minute, 30 minute, and the 45 minute routines.

I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is looking for ""learn to bellydance"" or ""learn beginning yoga"" DVDs.  This is better served as an aid for those who already have basic foundations in both.  Having said as much, like all new routines, don't expect to be able to move exactly like your instructor.  She does provide examples of some alternative methods for those with injury or tight muscles and simply can't bend into certain positions.

The bellydacing drills are great for warming up the body and burning some calories. I had never been taught in class to repeat dance moves in a ""drilling"" fashion so this technique has been beneficial for me as I've applied it to most other bellydancing moves that I struggle with.

I was happy to see a performance on the DVD and my husband and I watched in awe.  While the dance, costume and set were beautiful, I'd probably slap the editor if I had the chance.  There are so many point-of-view changes during the performance that you don't get to see the intricacies of the dance and it's a little difficult to relax and enjoy.  But the music is great and I believe the artist's CD is being offered as a set with the DVD from Amazon.",1129593600,4,1463,4.520912547528517

2158542,4,B000621452,"Good quality, good camera work, she does everything in front of a camera at a 45 degree angle most times in front of a entire wall mirror which seems perfect to see when doing bellydance. You really feel you're in a class because she's not fake, she's watching the mirror to make sure her form is correct just like everyone should be rather then fake smiling. Great detailed voiceover cuing especially warings on incorrect posture, very relaxed, but not boring. Good tribal music beat to keep you centered & going pretty good.

cool down: cat & cow & child's pose then spread leg forward fold for 4 min, then corpse for 6 min with videos of high speed clouds in sky going by.
The only things are since there are workout options, each drill & yoga pose is filmed by itself so when put together they do fade in/outs. For the drills it's fine & seen like that on most, but on the yoga you have to catch up a second. The only other thing is I wish it had more content.

There is a clip on youtube",1127260800,16,2014,4.399463806970509
2158543,2,B000621452,"This is an interesting video.  I like how Rachel really concentrates on technique, and doing things slowly rather than quickly.  The yoga was also a different, somewhat refreshing, way of warming up.  However, I didn't feel the video flowed well.  The transitions were a bit abrupt (ex: going from the yoga to the dance moves).  And, I didn't feel it was very ""dance-like"" at all.  It gives you exactly what it says it will--but nothing much more.  There are bellydance ISOLATIONS and yoga.  It is good if you're really looking to enhance your bellydance routine and get down and REALLY focus on the core muscles.  If you're looking for something fast-paced or exciting, this is going to bore you.  Not a good first video for someone with little or no experience.  Also, there are three seperate workouts (each one longer than the previous), but there is little new material in these.  I feel like, they simply added the first workout to the second, then added another few movements to make it longer.  I wanted more of a progression, and once you've done the longest workout, you've done everything the video has to offer.  Again, as a previous reviewer said, it's fine for the price.",1127174400,9,1185,4.745098039215686
2158544,5,B000621452,"This is a wonderful dvd to add to your conditioning routine - whether you are an experienced dancer or new to bellydance!  This is not a bellydance lesson, nor is it choreography. It is a grouping of fairly intense abdominal drills and yoga posturing that will dramatically, and in short time, increase overall strength - especially in the abs!

The dvd features an exquisite (tho strangely shot) performance by Rachel Brice and 3 yoga/drill routines - 15 min, 30 min and 45 min sets. You will warm up and cool down with yoga, and in between you will receive instruction on hip locks, rib cage isolations, endulations, etc. Rachel breaks these movements out very slowly so that you can listen to the verbal cues and watch her execute them.

If done on a regular basis, you will not only lose inches but also add the core strength you will need in your bellydance rituals.

Having said all that - let me say this - in 4 weeks of regular use, I have lost at least 3 inches in my waist (I do the 30 min routine plus 1 hr a week dancing in class - thats it)...and friends and family are amazed at my abdominal strength and control (endulations get a resounding applaud from the hubby).

It ain't easy - but nothing worth doing is :-)

2158558,5,B000621452,"I can understand how this video won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's really excellent for its intended purpose. For a serious bellydancer, I think it's a good investment for a very low price.

What it isn't: A performance video (though there is one excellent Rachel Brice performance, horribly mangled by spastic camera work and editing), a video for beginners (the moves shown *are* pretty basic, but it's better if you already know what they are and how to do them), a video to teach new dance moves (I did learn one new thing from them: the torso figure-8, but everything else was review)

What is is: A companion for a good, thorough drilling session, suitable for all styles of bellydance, not just tribal fusion. I'd recommend it for dancers of intermediate to advanced levels.

The yoga warm-up and cool-down are very good; the warm-up gets the heart rate up and gently stretches the muscles. The full sun salutation builds balance and leg strength, and the locust pose is good for strengthening the lower back.

The drills are not particularly exciting, but sometimes to really master something, you just have to do it -- carefully and purposefully -- over and over again. Rachel's isolation and muscle control are astounding, and it's very helpful for me to follow along with her. I put a mirror next to the tv when I'm using this video, and I try to make sure that I'm using the same muscles that she is.

The inclusion of 3 workouts of varying lengths -- 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes -- is a nice touch. It makes it easy to fit into any schedule. Come home late from work and need to dash off somewhere? 15 minutes is good for maintaining skill level. Have lots of time? 45 minutes makes for a very thorough workout.

I consider myself to be in good shape (I lift weights, I've been bellydancing for 2 years and have studied other dance forms for nearly 10 years), but the first few times of using this video, my abs and back and legs were noticeably sore the next day. The workout never *feels* particularly strenuous, but it's great for building strength and control in muscles that nobody but a bellydancer uses. ;)

After regular use of these drills, I've noticed tremendous and rapid improvement in my movement execution. I can get sharp locks on hip drops and lifts, I can do interior hip circles and tuck the pelvis using just my lower abs (Rachel is right... this *is* one of the harder isolations to master. But it does come with practice, and it's well worth the effort), and I have smooth, muscular undulations. Well worth the price!

What I *really* want to master next is Rachel's beautiful and sinuous arms... :)",1125360000,9,2651,4.625531914893617

Being a beginner I felt that a good deal of the drills were not yet within my realm of expertise but the yoga poses are very helpful. The video is worth it for the yoga alone!

This video will only be helfpul to those who have some basic experience with bellydance. The Neena and Veena videos are great for the basics, while Tribal Fusion is better for polishing your technique.

2158580,4,B000621452,"I've been bellydancing for about 3 solid years now (and, surprisingly enough, volunteer-teaching at the beginning level within my college for 2 of those years), and I like this workout-for-bellydancers.

This DVD is put out by the Bellydance Superstars Co.  Rachel is extremely talented, both in yoga and bellydance and in dance (i.e. using your body at its fullest capability, creatively and interpretively, to music).

This DVD is not about Rachel.  Its about working out.

I pre-ordered it as soon as I heard it existed, and waited through several delays.  When I got it, I was disappointed with the rushed quality (though it made sense since I got it for $12), and I was very, very disappointed with the editing of the performance video, and the release was delayed so many times.  I feel that this was somewhat out of her hands, since it was produced by BDSS.  The editor thought that making a music video was more important, for her performance section, and a lot of the other extras are pixelated, and there's a lot of gratuitous merchandising (thankfully, not within the workout itself).

Despite the low quality inherant in such an inexpensive DVD, the purpose of the DVD is fulfilled.  The title says ""Yoga Isolations & Drills for Bellydance"".  (emphasis added)

Beginning and througout each workout (the contents of which are explained in other reviews), Rachel goes over some basic yoga moves to warm up the muscles that are involved.  For a full stretch, its too little; for a warm-up and for strengthening exercises in their own right, its fine.  What I really appreciate is her vocal instruction and commentary.  Her skill at as a yoga instructor really comes through since she is so aware of problems her students probably have (neck problems, when they are clenching their jaws or slouching).

In the belly dance isolation drills -- which are exactly that, drills of isolations and simple basic movements -- she is equally good at commenting.  Here, the editing is great and the views are informative.  A friend of mine took a workshop from Rachel in person and raved about the clarity of each move because Rachel's own musculature makes the movement clear; the same is present here.  Each of her movements are clear, for those who learn by imitating, and each of her comments are informative and pertinent. Even her own readjustments are reminders for the student to readjust themselves.  The set-up is the same one that people admire about Jillina's videos (which I haven't seen) where the camera stays stationary and Rachel stands in front of a mirror, so that your body easily translates to hers at all times.

The drills are isolations -- pops, locks, undulations, etc.; fundamental moves useful to any sect of bellydance.  Each section works first on re-establishing what posture is necessary, what muscles are used, how the body moves to the next phase, etc.  Then it moves up to quicker repitition.  Its very much an exercise video for developing strength and crispness.

I think I value the 15-min workout (which really is 15 min, I discovered happily before my early morning academic class/work) and the 45 min. workout.  The 30 min. one seems just to be a blend between the two.

Because of the editing (again, I blame BDSS rather than Rachel) the transitions are abrupt, but its a DVD so you can just as easily keep the remote control nearby and pause for a moment to get into position.

Because its a workout (not workout pretending to be bellydance or bellydance for fitness) and because its about basic isolations and repititions of muscle-developing movements, there's no choreography and its not aerobic.  Think of it as weight training for the belly dancer.  You will break a sweat if you're doing the moves with the amount of concentration and control that she recommends, and you will get stronger.

The only way this could get better is if it came with a weighted dance belt.",1121731200,15,3913,4.865558912386707
2158581,4,B000621452,"I have tried the 15 and 30 minute practices thus far. I love Rachel for her muscular dancing, and this video shows it off. She covers some very basic hip and chest moves, but with appropriate emphasis on 'how' you execute them. Even after the 15 minute drill, I could feel it! I found it easy to follow, albeit fast paced, and really enjoyed the yoga style warm up and cool down at the end. I will be using this as my 'refining my basics' portion of my personal practices.",1121212800,2,472,4.2555555555555555
2158582,5,B000621452,"First I want to say this video is EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IN THE TITLE. To review something negatively for not having what it never claimed to have is ridiculous  - even more ridiculous: ""[I] no longer have a tight little tummy, so some of the bellydance moves don't look so good on me for dancing"" - Sorry I don't see that as a fault of the DVD or a reason not to give it a star, and one of the things I love about bellydancing is the variety of body shapes I see on dancers, this is a body-positive dance. If you feel insecure about your body, go to a class and see all the women of every different shape and age with their belly out dancing beautifully (There are women in their teens all the way up to their 70's in my class).

This is a PRACTICE DVD. I don't believe it is meant as a introduction to bellydance, to teach choreography or to replace a teacher/class situation (but I don't think any DVD does).

Dancers of every level benefit from drilling the basics. The drills - Hip locks, chest locks, undulations - these are the foundation of bellydance and build muscle memory and I see a difference in my dancing since I've been using this DVD. The yoga is perfect for building muscle control and improved my dance posture and over-all wellness.

I use this constantly and it has replaced all of my other videos (even other bellydance superstar videos). And I'm REALLY picky. Its not fake, its helpful and challenging, and the camera shows the parts of Rachel that are important to the move not just her FACE or her BOOBS like a few of the other videos I have and will not mention. (pet peeve)

If you are looking for a DVD to enhance your daily practice this is the one! If you are looking for dancing and choreography - GET YOUR BUTT TO A CLASS!

Overall, this was a great dvd and I really enjoy doing it.  I do like the yoga introduction into the workout and the ending of the 45 minute workout.  I've done the ""corpse"" pose before and never really found it that relaxing until I did it on this dvd.  I'm not sure if it's because your muscles are so tired by the end or what.  :)  Very good dvd and also good for beginners.  You definately feel it in your stomach muscles.

2158584,3,B000621452,"I like the fact that this DVD includes yoga with bellydance, but I think that there is too much time spent on the yoga, and not enough on dance.  The sun solutes at the beginning seem to take up half of the workout.  I was hoping to get more of an introduction to the basics of tribal bellydance.  The drill section is very short, and as soon as I feel like I'm starting to get warmed up, it's over. This is true of both the 30 and 45 minute workouts. I timed them on my DVD player and here's what I figured out.  The 30 minute practice is actually about 33 minutes.  It starts with yoga, then drills, then more yoga.  About half of the time is yoga.  The 45 minute practice is not really 45 minutes at all.  Instead, it's the exact same thing as the 30 minute workout (plus one extra drill I think), then for the last 10 minutes you lie on your back on the floor and relax while clouds float by.  Surely there could have been more dance instruction in those 10 minutes.

  The good thing about this video is that Rachel breaks down each move into a series of muscle contractions, then smoothes them out.  This allows you to really see how to do each move.  Also, she is very pretty to watch.

  Her performance is beautiful, but I wish that there had been less editing.  The choppy editing makes it so that you can't actually see how she combines moves.",1119571200,8,1354,4.202334630350195

As a teacher myself, I highly recommend it to my students for additional practice, and I use it during my own practice time when I feel I need more structure and to get back to basics.  I can't emphasize enough how important it is to include adequate stretching and strenghthening exercises in your dance practice, in Brice's DVD this is beautifully and easily illustrated.

A little bit of the dubbing is rough, but it's a largely well-produced DVD, I hope that more are to come.",1116547200,4,741,4.7578125
2158586,5,B000621452,"DVD is broken into 15, 30 and 45 minute workouts. I think the 45 is the most beneficial, but if you don't have time the other options at least give you a little something to keep you moving forward.

You should know that this DVD is not going to teach you how to bellydance or provide you with a complete routine. It is really structured for those already praticing bellydance who want drills to better refine their technique or supplement a class. For that, it is really excellent. I've seen a lot of instructional dvds for bellydance and I found her approach in this one to be really helpful! I was already familiar with the moves but this DVD gave me a better understanding and helped me to to better refine and improve the movements. Rachel does an excellent job breaking down each move, and the brief performance at the end is stunning.

Negative - there is no transition between the yoga workout and the standing isolations which may seem jarring to some, although I thought it worked overall. Also the locust pose might seem daunting, but I think overall it's a really good combination. If you're not already familiar with yoga, just take it slow and don't push too hard.",1114732800,,1178,4.578199052132701
2158587,5,B000621452,"i do yoga once or twice a week, and i feel like i am in moderate shape. by the end of the fourth move, hip locks on the down, i was sweating more than i do after a 3 mile run. but it was a good feeling. she does a very nice job of explaining how to perform each movement, and since she has fantastic control over her own muscles, you can actually see which muscles you are supposed to be using with each movement. and she sweats too, so you know that she isn't really messing around (a minor detail that i found very encouraging.) the pace is definitely a little on the tough side, so i don't know if i'd necessarily recommend it to a beginner, especially one who gets discouraged easily. the entire workout is broken up into different lengths, you can do a 15, 30, or 45 minute session, with the most difficult moves reserved for the 45 minute session, but the easier ones overlap with the shorter practices. make no mistake - this dvd does not aim to teach you how to dance; it teaches you how to isolate groups of muscles to make your own dancing better. i can see how a person who prefers cabaret to tribal would get bored; if i had to compare it to yoga styles, i'd say that the attention to detail is way more like iyengar - you do spend a fair amount of time working on each isolation. but you will get the workout of a serious ashtanga class. i actually really like it because the level of explanation is so good that i think if you have the patience to acquire the skills she is teaching, you will be able to get a lot out of the instruction provided in the dvd. by no means will you become rachel brice, but your dancing will take on an entirely new level of precision and style for the effort. as an added bonus, there is a short performance that is absolutely mesmerizing to a lil novice like me. and of course bdss had to shamelessly plug their own merchandise... but you don't have to look at it to view the rest of the dvd.",1114560000,10,1938,4.156914893617022
2158588,2,B000621452,"First of all, you would have to be a pretty advanced yogini to begin with to get ample benefit from this workout.  I would definately recommend using a different yoga workout or class before attempting to jump into the poses that she does or you might injure yourself. There is no smooth transition into or out of the yoga poses and they are intermingled with standing bellydance isolations that are broken down so slowly that you barely get to see the result of the move up to speed.  And there is no choreography or combinations, really no dance instruction whatsoever. And in thaty way it is rather ungratifying because bellydance is about dancing, getting in touch with your rhythme, building confidence and balance in your space and yourself.  When you take out the dancing and just use the components of the dance, disect them and break them down into rigid contractions, you lose the spirit.  this dvd was all hard work and no feeling.
This dvd is more for the experienced dancer who knows all the moves already and wants to incorporate yoga into their practice.  So don't expect to learn any new moves. There are very minimal dance moves at all- I think a total of 7 (two undulations, rib circles & drops, hip & pelvis locks) that are littered (some repeatedly, same filming segment again) between locust pose, salutaions, and some folds.
the performance piece is short and very industrial sounding music that never really picks up a beat, so it is all spacey body accents to a song that is all intro.
In short it was indeed challenging but certainly something you want to use as a warm-up before dancing- you aren't going to learn any Rachel Brice choreography from this one (we hope she'll do another cuz she is such a beautiful dancer).  I have been using it as a warm-up bfore practice and I have noticed an increase in my flexibility and balance.",1114560000,19,1859,4.652439024390244
2158589,4,B000621452,"I'll start out by saying that I'm not a tribal/tf dancer, and I know very little about Rachel Brice, I'm not an vested ""fan"" of hers.  I am also at an intermediate fitness level, doing mostly bellydance, pilates and weight training.

This video delivers exactly what it says it does...practise drills and muscular training for raks sharki.  I have to admit, Rachel is a bit intimidating to me (I'm short-waisted and her torso is two miles long).  However her body structure allows you to see her muscular contractions perfectly in the video, so you can get it down right.

I have many other videos from the ""bellydance"" category.  This is the first one that really breaks down the movements for me into the smallest increments. The others just show the movements, and you're on your own to practise them.  This one allows me that practise without having to try and discipline my innately lazy and unguided self from square one.

I should also note that, although the movements Brice drills are not comprehensive, I think that they are the essentials...master these the way she shows you, and you will have the muscle control to do just about anything else.  If you start a dance session with this, your form will be solidly set for any and all raks you do afterwards.

And for goodness sake...in the yoga section...all that ""standing poses-down-to-floor poses-and-back-up-again"" is called a SUN SALUTATION, it's a standard cycle of yoga poses that even this yoga novice is aware of!  You see the title onscreen before the cycle even starts.  If you don't know enough about yoga to be aware of that, I would recommend some other basic yoga videos before this one.  If you're offended about that level of yoga being practised in a ""bellydance video""...ya shoulda read the title of the video.  Clearly Brice is recommending at least some yoga practise if you are interested in her skill level of dance (or something approaching it).

I had to knock a star off my rating because I wanted more performance footage, and without the funky edits.  I understand that the edits were done to create a certain mood, but I want to see more clearly how Rachel applies her technique.  A troupe performance would have been nice as well.",1114214400,7,2220,4.769633507853404

I did the 15 min work out and didn't like that it jumped to a yoga postition on the floor, a standing move, back to the floor...ect.  Not a lot of transition time to get you up and down.  Also, it needed more of a warm up, especially since it's demonstrating yoga moves.

Each move is given very little time and sadly, these moves that are the basis of our beautiful dance come across as horribly boring on this DVD. For a beginner in a regular class this DVD will give you a bit of extra practice. For an intermediate/advanced student you will watch it once and then likely never again. For those trying to learn Rachel's style, you will not get a thing from this DVD. I found more relevant information on her backbend technique on her newsgroup.

Perhaps if you're looking for a performance DVD, you should not purchase one that is for drilling.  And if one is an advanced dancer, as many claim to be in some of these reviews, one knows that the way to improve is by drilling, drilling, drilling.  And that never stops, even when you become a professional.

I love this DVD.  It is EXACTLY what it claims. I'm not super excited about the editing in the performance part, but what can you expect from Miles Copeland?  Rachel's dancing inspires me, and that makes me want to drill so I can get even better!",1112572800,11,695,4.476190476190476

3. The music is very unique and does not overpower the narrator nor the viewer, which is nice, so that one can concentrate on the asanas and drills.

  Rachel gives clear, effective instructions that really help you to understand how to do the drills. She explains which muscles to contract, when to breathe, and how the body should be positioned. She also tells you what parts of the body should NOT be used in each drill, which I think is important to correctly learn the drills.

  This dvd combined yoga and bellydancing to give a nice variation to the workout that most dvds don't have. Its a tough workout, but it really shapes you're stomach. I noticed a difference in my waist in just a few weeks.

  I would deffinetly recommend this to anyone interested in either bellydancing or yoga. Brice did a wonderful job, I hope to see a sequel to this.",1111968000,6,839,4.467105263157895

Remember you get what you pay for and in this case, a LOT more. I think it's a fine practice companion, and challenge ANY of you to go out and make a better DVD yourselves if you think you can. That said, here are my opinions, both positive and what I think could be improved:

Why I think it's good: love the ability to choose length of workout. It does not promise to be anything other than a beginner's practice video and it's very good for that. It did not claim to teach new yoga moves or new dance moves or how to put them together. I also LOVE Carolena's input which is precious and her outtakes.

What can be improved in my opinion: Rachel's face, #1. It is too severe and a bit off-putting, much too serious and not at all like who she really is. Pretty minor complaint, though. The second thing is: people continue to think Rachel performs American Tribal Style BellyDance, which she does NOT. This is a Copeland title designed to sell more DVDs. Rachel acknolwedges she performs a type of Tribal Fusion. ATS is ALWAYS done in groups and is improvised, very very rarely choregraphed. There is no ATS in the BDSS show at all. I wish Miles would listen to Rachel and call what she does what it is because it is misleading.

Those are my opinions and I hope someone reads far enough down this list to see it!

A $15 VERY WELL spent!!!!!!

2158618,5,B000621452,"People appear to either love this DVD or hate it.

I think it's less love/hate than have unreasonable expectations or don't have unreasonable expectations. Alot of the reviews on this site are infuriating to me because they completely miss the point.

This DVD contains BASIC DRILLS, ISOLATIONS AND YOGA POSES which will, if practiced regularly, improve your dance skills.

It is not a performance DVD, nor does it claim to be.

It will not teach you to dance like Rachel, nor does it claim it will.

Rachel Brice does not dance ATS, nor does she claim to.

What this DVD does claim to do is provide you with basic drills that will help you gain flexibility and core strength, and refine the movements that you learned from your own bellydance instructor. And it does a fine job at that.

I am a beginning bellydancer, at an intermediate fitness level, and I find it challenging. Luckily, the workout is divided into three different options, each one adding movements onto the preceding practices. Just so people know what to expect, the following is a breakdown of what is on the DVD:

The 15 minute practice includes:

- Half Sun Salutes

- Locust Pose

- Hip Locks on the Up

- Hipwork on the down

- Chest Lifts

- Undulations up to down (Body Roll)

- Cat and Cow poses

The 30 minute practice does a full sun salute with lunges and adds to the 15 minutes practice the following moves:

- Chest drops

- Undulations down to up (Reverse Body Roll)

- Pelvic locks front

- Interior hip circles

- Spread leg forward fold

The 45 minute prace includes everything above, except the hipwork on the down (I'm not sure, but this may be an error on the DVD, because the practice really clocks in at about 40 minutes). Added for this practice is:

- Double Chest locks

- Rib Cage Figure Eight

- 5 minutes of Corpse pose (with floaty clouds on the screen, and a doumbek drumming at about heart-beat speed)

To wrap up -

This DVD does what it says it will, and does it well.

No more, no less.

If you are looking for a shortcut to make you dance like Rachel, keep dreaming. If you want some exercises which, with lots (and lots and lots) of hard work, will set you out on the right path, I think this is a great choice. It's also about half the price (or less) of most Bellydance DVDs so that's a bonus as well.

Comments regarding the dance style, performance editing, and other irrelevant details are mainly catty and completely missing the point. Please disregard them, or you may miss out on a very useful and well produced tool.",1111536000,43,2532,4.453159041394335

When I saw Rachel Brice ""Tribal Fusion"" I thought it would be perfect.  I am learning tribal style dance. Anyway,  I got the impression that there would be more of a fusion of yoga into the dance- I guess. Instead, it was more like a warm-up before you do some belly dance steps/poses to a drum beat. Was that supposed to be the point?! I hope there is more to it than that! There are lots of repetitions of movements , which is what you have to do when you are learning new moves ( drills) designed to help you with your posture,etc She is a talented teacher  and gives verbal instructions thoroughout.  You have a choice to take out the voice over as well.

The moves are very much for the beginner student but they too might not feel challenged enough by the end of the tape. I was disappointed that I didn't learn any new yoga or bellydance moves nor will I be able to use it as a practice tape (too basic).  Mostly I was bummed because I am a huge fan of Rachel Brice and I don't think that this was made with much thought.

2158632,1,B000621452,"This DVD delivers on absolutely none of its promises.  And that's very sad because this could have been great.  The DVD displays neither Rachel Brice, who is a great dancer, nor American Tribal, which is cool, nor yoga,  sufficiently well to earn a single good review.  And yet there are many ""5-star"" reviews.  More on THAT in a moment.  Very few belly dance moves are taught on this DVD, and all are very basic.  None is peculiar to the tribal style that I want to learn.  The yoga part is, to say the least, limited and not presented in a way consistent with any valid school of yoga.  The short performance portion is, well, short.  Extremely short.  And worse, it does not present the tribal style in any sort of an interesting light.  I am not a beginner in belly dance but I would not recommmend this DVD even to my beginner friends.  It's too basic for anyone and not at all inspiring.  I am interested in American Tribal and I have taken a class with Rachel.  I came away from that class richer for the experience and admiring her.  We would all love to see Rachel Brice create a great DVD about American Tribal and the use of yoga in that context.  But this DVD doesn't do any of that.  It simply does not measure up.  It could have, but it doesn't.  The quality is not there.  Rachel, you can't just create any-old DVD and expect the world to bow down to you!  It has to be good!  And this one isn't!  It's a bad video.  And so it is wrong to scramble more than 25 members of tribe-dot-net to post 5-star reviews, all in a flood on March 17, 18, 19, and 20, 2005.  Rachel posted a thank you at sanfranciscotribe-dot-net, pointing out that ""poopy"" reviews had ""made sales drop"" but now after her friends ""came through"" for her, the DVD is ""in the top ten fitness videos.""  Does Rachel not see that by marshalling her troops in this way she is compromising the independent review system?  What if every producer did this?  There are some controversial belly dance videos here and you see bad reviews right and left.  Somehow the producers restrain themselves from trying to manipulate the public forum.

Yes, it's a beginner DVD but it's still incredibly basic. I thought I would get some insight into how to adapt a yoga practice to the strength and flexibility a bellydancer might need to try Rachel's technique but instead all I got was a series of sun salutations, a sudden transition to locust pose, cat/cow and straddle stretch at the end. In between her breakdown of some rib/hip isolations is very clear and occasionally interesting ( you can really see her tribal style in how she does her camels, for example) but it just wasn't enough. If you're a huge fan of hers you'll want to support her, I suppose and if you're a baby dancer you could do far worse than her instruction on how to isolate your ribs/hips. If you're a fairly veteran dancer and yogini then pass on this one and hope she digs deeper in her follow-up DVDs. The performance section is bizarrely edited and does her a great disservice.",1111363200,15,1030,4.543010752688172
2158634,2,B000621452,"Okay, if you are a complete and total beginner, you might like this.

It's not a total waste of $, but I am really disappointed. From what little I have seen of Rachel Brice in the past, I have truly liked her style. She is a great dancer.

I ordered this from Amazon back in November, and waited through numerous postponements. I was so excited when it finally showed up today.

I just watched it. I guess I can't say what I was really expecting, but it was defintely more than what I got.

I have been dancing for four years and doing yoga for six.

As said in previous reviews, the yoga poses are somewhat useless. It's nothing more than what I do before any performance, and way less than just my standard yoga practice. Those who know yoga will be left unfulfilled, and those who don't will be faced with a combination of simple beginner poses, and poses way too advanced for them.

The dance moves: they too are incredibly basic. I think she would have been better off with more of a fundamental dance theory approach. Again, it is nothing I don't know, and nothing that I don't do already to music I already own.

I guess it will be somewhat useful as a ""motivational"" tool. Throw it on and follow along to get your practice in.

I also hoped the bonus performance would be of some use for study of her style. Well, to be blunt it looks like it was produced in some goth kids' basement with mom's video camera. Even the routine itself sucks. She takes her signature slow, ethereal style and completely overdoes it. There is little to no actual dancing - a lot of undulating and snake arms, and the picture being painted that this woman is way too into herself. Sorry Rachel, but that's how it comes off. Buyers,  you're better off watching the clips on her website to get a good study of her style. I will give Rachel kudos for adding the narration later - fitness videos always end up being lame if the instructor is speaking while performing.

Summary: if you're a total beginner, go for it. If you're not, think twice.

If you want a good yoga video, check out Yoga Shakti or the series released by Tracey Rich.",1111363200,16,2121,4.385204081632653
2158635,5,B000621452,"I've found this DVD to be an excellent practice companion, providing certain bellydance drills and yoga positions that will strengthen one as a dancer. The performance was outstanding and the filming of it, though frustratingto a dancer trying to learn the choreography, was nevertheless aesthetically pleasing.

The 2 negative reviews are misleading.

One seems to have a problem with there being too much yoga, which seems a little ridiculous considering that the title is Yoga, Drills and Isolations. ONe should realize from the title that yoga is a prominent feature of the DVD and those familiar with Rachel Brice's style realize that her practice of yoga has had a phenomenal impact on her dance.

The second negative review seems to be a rant against the tribal style as a whole. Again Tribal Fusion is part of the title so if you think that Tribal is somehow inferior or inauthentic to cabaret, why would you buy it and then complain about the style featured in the DVD? This is not helpful to anyone.

If you want to get into a debate about authenticity, the cabaret style which is so familiar to the public is also an American invention, influenced by Hollywood and showgirl glamor. Unless you are performing folkloric dances of the Middle East, neither of these styles are authentic in that way. But who says they have to be? TO argue the validity of a particular dance style is completely irrelevant to a review of this DVD. And reducing people's posting of positive reviews as being merely a facet of the close-knit tribal community or a false means to bolster or support Miss Brice is a ridiculous, insulting and unnecessary comment. Most of this reviewer's comments are not helpful but merely cutting remarks on the nature of tribal dance and one of it's prominent stars.

There is no false advertising as these people claim. It does not purport to be an instructional bellydance DVD. It is a PRACTICE COMPANION, featuring (as clearly stated in the title) Yoga, Drills and Isolations  which is helpful to dancers of all levels and features yoga poses that are helpful in particular to bellydancers.",1111363200,,2113,4.871866295264624

2158638,2,B000621452,"The exercises and drills on this DVD are taught and performed by Rachel Brice, an instructor of the so-called ""American Tribal"" style of dance, a dance trend that emerged recently in California. This style of dance is not what the general public recognizes as ""bellydance"". It emphasizes introspective, meditative dance or group faux folkloric dances, with the steps  borrowed or created from a mish-mash of ethnic dance sources, such as Middle East, India, Asia, North Africa, Pacific islands, Eastern Europe and other areas around the world. In American-tribal style the sexy, glamorous and playful image of bellydance is replaced with the  focus on sisterhood, purity and feminine empowerment. Although Rachel Brice is one of the best-known performers in this style, the material on the DVD is too basic to qualify as teaching any particular style. As a matter of fact, IMHO it is too basic, period, even for beginners.

The yoga poses included on the DVD are:  simple sun salutations, locust, cat-cow and corpse poses. The bellydance moves taught are: hip up and down accents, chest lift and figure 8, undulation, hip circle and pelvic accent. There is no instruction devoted to any moves specific to the American-tribal dance style or any moves in which Rachel Brice excels as a performer. There is nothing about connecting or putting these isolated moves together.

Such an approach is not appropriate for beginner instruction, beginners won't  drill these few disjointed moves, they need a  much more cohesive approach to keep them motivated and inspired. At the same time the material is too basic for intermediate or advanced students. I regret to say this, but every dancer I know (myself included) who has purchased this video has expressed disappointment with the instruction it offers. The quality of the instruction is good, but the material is too limited and it misses both groups, bellydance beginners and American-tribal dancers.

The American-tribal genre is quite self contained,the numbers of ""Tribal"" dancers are relatively small and the sense of sisterhood is very strong. It is understandable that they vote their support for their dance form by uploading zillions of five star reviews full of outpourings of devotion for Rachel Brice. However, the resulting image of this product is not true to reality. The yoga instruction on this DVD is nothing special  next to the very many great yoga DVDs out there. There are much better videos, both in method and material, to help you develop flexibility for dance. The very few bellydance drills don't offer anything you won't find on most beginner dvds. No pointers to the ""secrets"" of Rachel Brice's individual technique.

I am not going to criticize the video editing of the performance piece included on the DVD because I don't think  any  video is worth buying for a 3 minute performance, even if you could actually see Rachel's moves.

Like many dancers, I like Rachel Brice's personal style of dance, but I am tired of hearing disappointed reactions from students misled by the grassroots marketing campaign for this product. This video is marginal to bellydance, it's marginal to yoga and the fact that you must drill every move to excel in dance is a platitude:  not a valid basis for an instructional video.",1111276800,16,3285,5.0817843866171

He was amazed at her stomach muscles. We were sitting there saying ""OOhh OOhh, look at that"", ""Oh man check that out"". He's in weight training at school so he was very impressed.

Practicing to it is extremely toning and strengthening. And it really helps with isolations. Beginner, intermediate, or advanced, this DVD can help all belly dancers.",1111104000,8,499,4.242105263157895
2158651,5,B000621452,"...novice and up, cabaret, tribal, fusion. I think no matter what level or style you're into there is much to be learned from this DVD. I'm actually more familiar with cabaret but into learning tribal too so I can see both sides of the belt here.

If you want to see her all smiley, sweet and silly, take a workshop from the girl, she's all those things and more in one incredible package. In the DVD however, she takes on a more subtle, quiet strength that actually helps me get into that same zen like mode. It helps in focusing in on what her voice over is saying, what her body is doing and what mine is doing, hehe, or trying to do ;) And honestly, I hadn't been conscious of the fact that it is a voice-over and not her speaking, facing and smiling to the camera until after someone else mentioning it.

The first few seconds of the performance kinda took me by surprise because it is some pretty rapid-fire cuts but I guess I got used to it and it's actually kinda cool that way. No, it sure doesn't beat seeing her live and in action though. I think the instruction of the video is great, the performance was just icing on the yummy cake and I'll take it any way ya she gives it!

Looking forward to more from this talented performer and teacher! Rachel, You Rak!",1111104000,8,1271,4.265560165975104

The dance moves are geared to beginners and for intermediate dancer who really wants to *feel* the movement they are doing. She does the hip lifts a little different than I learned (no foot lifting) them so its nice to switch it up a bit. Also I think the performance peice at the end was wonderful, the camera does go with the music BUT I would like the option of seeing just one full shot of the performance as well. I really want to see where your feet are when you drop to the floor! SO all in all I have recommended it to my friends and I have been working with this video for a week (since I got it) and I'm getting my mom to try it out with me too. This video leaves me Hungry for more Rachel!!",1111104000,8,797,4.018867924528302
2158653,5,B000621452,"Rachel Brice has created a wonderful tool for dancers and non-dancers mixing age old yoga practice with new tribal fusion style.  Cabaret belly dancers will also get a wonderful workout.

Rachel is great in person.  I've had the honor of taking workshops and seeing her perform several times.  She's also the most honest and thoughtful instructor and performer.  You can tell that her goal is to provide quality in whatever she does.

The DVD has different length workouts to choose from (15, 30, and 45 min), so you can fit something into your schedule. Rachel performs the moves while her optional voiceover audio instruction plays.  There is no distraction of her trying to explain and move at the same time, AND it provides a higher quality of sound. The moves are very fluid and focused- her signature style.  The yoga focus will help provide grace, stature, flexibility, and breath control to all users. The camera and studio mirrors are positioned in such a way that you can see the move from several angles. The lighting and color are also very high quality.

This DVD is not an attempt to throw a new workout on the market or to bring belly dance into mainstream America (which wouldn't be bad), but it is a carefully thought out tool to use for health and skill enhancement.  Rachel provided what so many of her fans have asked for--the ability to continue studying with her every day in order to improve themselves.",1111104000,10,1426,4.7368421052631575

Not only does it take you on a drill adventure, but it also aids in the mind-body connection through yoga which is so intrinsic to dance and to really getting intuned with one's body.  This DVD is truly worth it and great to do several times a week!",1111017600,8,359,4.042253521126761
2158655,5,B000621452,"I love this DVD.  I want to do it over and over, unlike many other fitness/instruction videos.  She does make you sweat and sore, but by the end she has lulled you down to practically being a relaxed puddle on the floor, ahhhhh...yeah.  Makes your body feel great, 'Thank you sir, may I have another?!'  Rare to find a video such as this that gives you the excersize you need but brings such a sense of calm and peace at the same time. I am also glad she went away from the talking to the camera with a cheesy fake smile and a perky aerobics voice.  I much prefer her calm soothing voice.  I don't understand why people are complaining that she doesn't look at the camera, why is that a big deal?  I'm too busy comparing my hips to hers or in a compromised yoga position to worry about where she's looking.  I much prefer her approach to the fake unblinking stare with a smile style of many other videos.

  As for the content, this is not just for begggining dancers.  She is so articulate in her descriptions, a fine tuning even advanced dancers need to practice to stay on top of their game.  The camera work here is great too, seemed to read my mind at times.  Right when I would think 'whats she doing with her feet right now?' and there it would go to her feet.  She also adds in just the right promps at the right times like, make sure the jaw is soft and you realize you *were* clenching it.

  I love the blending of yoga and bellydance.  The yoga felt soooo good after the dance moves, but wasn't too much to not feel like a dance video.  I think her choices in which yoga moves to utilize were excellent.  I also love the music used and the atire Rachel chose to wear.

  As for the performance, the camera work is a bit distracting at first, but please give it a chance.  It will grow on you and you will stop noticing them so much.  Theres too much awesome dancing going on for you not to watch it.

  An Awesome DVD!  I do hope she makes more, this one sits at the top of my DVD stack because I use it so much!! Get this DVD!  Your body will thank you!!",1111017600,212,2067,4.130982367758186

2158657,5,B000621452,"Tribal Style Bellydance has it's critics, namely those who do not consider it to be bellydance but rather world fusion dance. Those who embrace the true origional spirit of bellydance know that how the dancer applies her own style and feeling to the music is really at the core of this art form that began as women dancing for women.
 Whatever your defenition, you cannot deny that Rachel Brice is a talented artist that has this dance coursing through her veins. Her explanations in the instructional DVD are clear enough for a beginner, yet the moves are challenging enough for a dancer at any level. Being a yoga instructor as well, Rachel leads you through the yoga postures with clear instructions, helpful tips, and a beautiful demonstration (Holy, this woman can MOVE!!).
Whether it is bellydance or yoga, Rachel knows what she is talking about and anyone can benefit from this DVD. The performance at the end gives you a taste of Rachel's modern take on an old art form, and those of us that dance are always inspired by her beautiful costuming creations.

The video and the information are very good and very helpful...but I just have to say that I would just really love it if Bellydance Superstars...would keep from being too radical with the filming of the performances. They did the same thing on the BDSS video. The filming for Rachel's performance on this video is a nightmare.  Great set, great subject, great performance but quit with the spastic camera angles and jerky shots.  Maybe get a director that is more into filming performance artist and NOT drastic music videos.  It makes me mad everytime I watch it!

The yoga warm-up and cool-down are fantastically solid and not some flimsy ""belly dance yoga"" routine.  Rachel also demonstrates her flawless dance style in an edgy 3 minute performance.  I can't wait for her second edition!",1111017600,7,455,4.794871794871795
2158671,5,B000621452,"The only thing I didn't like about this DVD didn't have anything to do with Rachel Brice or her style - it's that I no longer have the remote to my DVD player where I work out, so I can't flip to the different sections. I have to use it in a little cramped space I'm not as comfortable with. A ""play all"" button would have been nice.

Rachel, on the other hand, is fabulous.

Honestly, I bought the DVD just to check it out, not expecting much. I've only ever seen Rachel this year at the BDSS show in Sacramento, I don't know much of her work other than that, and I started out studying egyptian, without a lot of interest in tribal (though now I've realized that was defensive on my part - I have a lot of tattoos and many people told me that the only place in belly dance for me was tribal. I hate to be forced into any groups).

This is an excellent beginner DVD, and one that people should feel they have mastered before looking to move on to the next level of her style and workouts. The practices are just hard enough to be challenging for more than just the first day (don't you hate DVDs that you can learn in 20 minutes, thereby leaving you no reason to really watch it again?) while still letting you feel like you can get there, you can learn this.

I love that Rachel encourages repetitive practice, and that she incorporates yoga, both things my egyptian teacher does. I've now gone out and started taking an intro tribal class, something I probably wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen Rachel and the Indigo perform (Michelle Campbell, also, really impressed me).

Thank you, Rachel Brice.",1111017600,9,1603,4.3478260869565215

The yoga is wonderful and I see how useful it can be on getting better range of motion and flexibilty when dancing.

The outtakes with Carolina are just comical and fun to watch.

The performance is great, beautifully done set. A little jumpy if trying to study but very nice just for viewing pleasure.

Would buy her next one sight unseen if as good as this one!",1111017600,7,537,4.448979591836735
2158673,5,B000621452,"I was extremely pleased with the DVD.  As others have mentioned, there is an introduction by Carolena (and the outtakes are so darn funny!), a yoga section and then a series of drills.  Rachel's voice is extremely pleasant and calming to listen to. I can't imagine what the other reviewer is thinking when she says Rachel has a ""sour"" expression.  To me, she seems serious and almost reverent, and I think that's perfect.  I hate it when someone has a fake smile plastered on their face throughout a video. Seriously, do ~you~ have a big grin the whole time you do yoga and drills, or are you serious and concentrating? ;)

The set is clean and attractive, well lit but not harsh and the camera changes angles appropriately.  I had no trouble following along at any point in the video.  I truly appreciate the fact that during the drills, you can see what her legs are doing, especially how much she bends at the knees. I wouldn't have minded if we could have seen her legs even more, the belt hides the movement a little, but I think it is still very acceptable. I had thought that I was some kind of freak due to the amount of bend I have to have in my knees to do some moves, and to see that Rachel does it too makes me ~really~ happy!

The one and only thing that I wish had been included was some form of snake arm drill. Rachel's snake arms are so beautiful that a breakdown of them would have been fantastic. I don't know if that is considered a more advanced move, perhaps it will be included in a second volume.

As far as the video performance goes, from an aesthetic standpoint I liked it.  It was edgy and cool, with an obvious music video feel.  Now if you are like most people and want to soak up every glorious movement Rachel makes, you might be disappointed in the editing.  I thought it was a great performance segment and worthwhile and entertaining to watch.

Overall, this DVD is ~exactly~ what I was looking for - something I can use as a regular practice to improve my flexibility and skills.  I give it five stars and a big ""you go girl!""",1111017600,9,2062,4.3359375

For a workout and for isolations, these workouts are excellent.  As it claims, it is definately a fusion of bellydance workout and yoga stretching and strengthening.

As a beginning dancer I find this DVD extremely challenging and a solid workout.  For all that I try to keep calm even breathing and as Rachel says to ""look and be relaxed"" it's quite tough for me to do that and keep up with her.  If you're looking for something thats a workout but easier to follow, i'd suggest one of Rania's Bellydance Workout DVDs.  If you're looking for a challenge and a way to bring yoga into bellydance, or if you have some dance experience and aren't completely infelxible, this DVD is a wonderful choice.",1110931200,8,843,4.617449664429531
2158676,4,B000621452,"Today I finally got to try Rachel Brice's DVD Tribal Fusion Belly Dance: Yoga, Isolations and Drills.  I decided to go with the 30-minute practice drills (there are three:  15-, 30-, and 45-minute).  Rachel starts the session off with a sun salutation (for a good warmup) and then with the locust asana (which is excellent for strengthening the lower back).  She then goes into drills for various isolations and locks.  She starts each isolation slowly, going through the muscles which should be contracted or released.  Then each movement is smoothed out and sped up.

Some reviewers complain that Rachel doesn't explain why the movements look so different on her.  First of all, Rachel has very little body fat.  Therefore, as each muscle is engaged, it is much more evident than it would be on a less sinewy dancer.  Secondly, her movements are very clean and smooth because she has been drilling on a regular basis.  Although drills are not exciting, repetition and consistency are the key to mastery.  If you follow along with the drills on this DVD on a regular and meticulous basis, you will become a more precise, isolated, and technical dancer.  I have no doubts on this.

The video isn't perfect.  One minor flaw is Rachel's camera-shyness.  She never looks directly at the camera, and remains very detached.  Once or twice, it is a bit difficult to see what she is doing when the camera pans so the mirror is directly behind her.  She's wearing dark pants, and the reflection is also dark.  However, the camera continues panning, and before long, it's easy to see what she's doing.  Again, this is a minor problem.

The worst thing about the video is the additional performance video.  Rachel does a very interesting dance to a dark and gothy song, and the camera-man decides to get all experimental on us.  During the 3-minute or so performance, there are more than 100 strobe-like cuts.  I can see that they were going for an edgy, music video feel, but considering the audience for this DVD is comprised of people who want to get a better understanding of Rachel's dancing, the edits are inappropriate and frustrating.  It's impossible to follow any one movement to completion.  It would have been much nicer had there been a performance clip which shows the movements in a clear and unchopped fashion.  Edgy, clipped videos could be saved for entertainment rather than educational DVDs.

On the flip side, the camera work for the drill section, although not static, is clear and appropriate.  When the camera goes in for a closeup of Rachel's abdomen, it's when she's demonstrating which muscles to contract.  When it flows along the contour of her spine, it's showing the correct alignment during yoga asanas.  Some videos dwell on the incorrect body part (eg. on a dancer's face or chest when the instruction is focusing upon hip or footwork).  This never happens in this DVD.

Also, Rachel has a pleasant and strong voice, and she explains each movement clearly.

The music (by Pentaphobe) is a minimalistic fusion of dark electronic and Middle Eastern rhythms.  It may not be to everyone's liking, but I enjoy it.

I strongly recommend this video to anyone who wants to improve their isolation skills.  I intend on using the DVD frequently.",1110931200,12,3259,4.849364791288567

While great for the yoga aspect, and the division into 15, 30, and 45 minute workouts is good, if you are looking to learn her amazing hip lock combinations or Turkish drops, you are best off taking her workshops. The DVD addresses basics that could be learned on other DVD's (Not being a Neena/Veena fan, I'm referring to BellyQueen, et.al.).  Nice addition to a collection, but not a mandatory.

I also had a problem with the performance editing, it does not capture her beautiful dance, but I also was dissapointed with the rest of the DVD. I found it very cold, devoid of personality. Rachel does a voice-over and she has a sour expression on her face the whole time, not like how sensual I remember her in the performance. Half of the instruction is yoga and not bellydance yoga, but straight forward yoga, which would be fine if she told you how this would help your bellydance practice or a to perform a particular move. I found the yoga out of place and with all the great yoga videos out there, unnecessary. However the biggest dissapointment is she doesn't share her secrets to her dancing. She breaks down the moves thoroughly, but does not explain why the moves look so different when she does them.",1110758400,12,1042,4.5132275132275135

I do have one major gripe though. I was so excited to get this video for the valuable info, of course, but even more so was to see more of her in action!!!! I was dying for the three minute performance! I finally get to see it and I was ready to strangle whoever could have been at all responsible for the horrible camera work. I'm all for creative camera angles and zooms and all of that but for goodness sake! I'm so disappointed! It changed so often that you couldn't even watch her do an entire move. I was so outraged that I counted the view changes. Honest to God: 111 times in 3 min. Thats ridiculous! The beauty of her slow controlled style is to watch her subtle articulation and see how she transitions in and out of moves. All lost with the shoddy editing.

I study the move and figure it out, eventually- to get the look of her style in each move you have to figure out which part of that move to really put your focus on.
