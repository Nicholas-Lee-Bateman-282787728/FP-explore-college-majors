6120393,5,B00GWJIDFW,"What exactly is so mesmerizing?
The acting, characterization, character development, plot lines, depth, and sweetness. Yes, amidst the emotional rubble is a goldmine of kindness and true connection.
If that weren't enough, the sheer humanity of this show will win you over.",1393200000,11,273,5.523809523809524
6120394,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Great characters, complex and very real story line.  The producers have continued to build on the characters and I cannot wait for the next season.",1393200000,7,147,4.88
6120395,1,B00GWJIDFW,"Can't watch this because Amazon requires me to download Silverlight and watch this on Silverlight. If you are like me, and you already own Silverllight, you have just bought yourself HOURS and HOURS of frustration!

Now, because you already own this product, you automatically are sent into a software download purgatory where nothing works.  You have to go through a series of non-helpful ""troubleshooting tips"" all because Amazon just has to tie its product to Silverlight (A Microsoft product, quelle surprise) and then won't be able to watch your purchase at all (but you will get extremely annoyed realizing that there is no way to get your money back without spending more hours on the phone and email.)

Thanks Amazon for completely wasting my time and money! HATE typing movies to Silverlight. Don't need to be FORCED how or on what software to watch my purchase!",1393113600,2,871,4.9520547945205475

6120398,4,B00GWJIDFW,"One thing about recovering addicts, they are usually not very much fun that first year of sobriety and this is true about season five of Nurse Jackie, not very much fun.  If I had to hear one more time about her sobriety and the fact she is a recovering addict my head would explode.

There were other problems with season five.  First and foremost was the loss of her best friend O'Hara, played by Eve Best, who has left NYC to be able to be with her new baby year round in the U.K.  It was a big loss as she was an integral part of the ensemble.  Next, Jackie finds a new boyfriend who is actually more boring than her ex-husband and not nearly as good-looking.  He comes across as a know-it-all and they don't seem to have the right chemistry.  We also have a new woman doctor in the ER who can't act and perform medicine at the same time.

I sadly miss the Jackie who snuck pain medication, led a double life, cheated on her husband, but was quick, intelligent and witty with all her patients.  This season her personality is lacking its usual vitality and she has become someone the old Jackie would dislike, a whiner and a cranky one at that.

On the good side, Zoey, played to perfection by Merritt Wever, just gets better with every season and this one is no exception, and the other regulars Eddie, Cooper, Thor, and Gloria are back and still as eccentric and well played as past seasons.  I still enjoyed the show.  It had its moments but they were just fewer and farther in-between then past seasons.  Jackie is a great character and Edie Falco does a wonderful job portraying her.  I believe that with a bit of work on the story-lines, some snappier dialogue and, some interesting developments that occurred late in the season, I have high hopes for a better season six.",1392940800,24,1782,4.409785932721713
6120399,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Some shows falls apart after a few seasons. In fact many studios fire the original
script writers once the show is successful to save money, knowing that fans will
watch the final one or two seasons out of loyalty and habit. Lucky for us Nurse Jackie
is still original, meaningful, complex, beautifully acted, and funny as all get out. Great season!",1392940800,20,349,4.737704918032787
6120400,5,B00GWJIDFW,"I look forward to this show every season and I am never disappointed. I have only one criticism, the plot lines from last season are too blithely wrapped up in the premier episode. Dr. O'Hara played so well by Eve Best leaves rather abruptly, and I would have loved to see Jackie and Zoey (Emmy winning Merritt Ever) play out longer as roomates, she and Edie Falco as Jackie have a priceless dynamic with Falco's straight man to Merritt's zaniness. But that said both new and old characters provide great comedy. It is hard to picture comedy amongst the chaos and tragedy of an urban emergency room but, having worked in one myself it is completely possible. Another new character is a self centered and vacuous Dr. Carrie Roman who meets her match in equally vain golden boy Dr. Cooper. Jackie is well Jackie, even after giving up the OxyContin, adderal, and Percocet, she is as blunt and irritable as ever. She has a lot to be annoyed about a divorce and custody battle, two daughters acting out, and an unexpected new romance. But she faces everything as usual head on and in her own way. And there is plenty of heart with she and the staff of All Saints  hospital saving lives and  trying to solve the problems of their patients every day.",1392768000,30,1243,4.544642857142857
6120401,3,B00GWJIDFW,"Feb 13 2014
This is a really good show, but I remember complaining about Season 4 containing only 10 1/2 hour episodes (and who would by extension consider a 5-episode hour show as a ""season""), and here again Season 5 is just as short and priced even higher. Season 4 has come down in price a lot. I wonder how long I should have waited?
Jun 13 2014
I finally relented and bought this season although the price had come down only a few bucks.
As before, 10 half-hour episodes -- a year in broadcast time -- gets chewed through in just a couple days. And as before, what there is of it is excellent.
So I will keep the rating at 3 stars, but because of the relative cost, not because of the show's quality. That is emphatically 5 stars.",1392249600,13,735,4.219858156028369

6120404,5,B00GWJIDFW,"This show is very funny.  I've seen all seasons, but I don't want to share the ending with you.  Like I said the series has a lot of really humorous parts to it.  The subject of her addiction starts out slowly.  I don't know if any of you have experienced addiction either for yourself or someone close to you.  As the show continues, the seriousness of addiction finally comes into play.  The character is a genius at protecting the fact of her addiction and continuing it despite interventions.  I am a recovering addict myself, so this show really hit home for me and was very sobering as the series progressed.  I have to say though that it did give me a ton of laughs.  Nurse Jackie is an opportunity to have some laughs, but also learn something about real life.",1483315200,,768,4.428571428571429

6120410,5,B00GWJIDFW,I've gone through all 7 seasons. The cast is incredible. The writing brilliant.

The ridiculous new doctor was a poor addition, and the new boyfriend is just an arrogant, unfunny jerk. Perhaps it's because this show has the shortest screen time of any show I can think of (5 hours total for a whole season) they just don't have the time to develop what they need to.

If four-letter words greatly offend you, you should probably be warned that there are lots of them - and usually they bother me, too.  But somehow, in the context of this show, they just seem natural.  (I can't explain that one.) Anna Deveare Smith is incredible as Akalytis, but it's not fair to single her out without giving the same kudos to all of the main characters.  Excellent show!",1411084800,,1050,4.489473684210527

get off it!! I do think she got off it, the last pill at her one year sobriety was a confirmation of that to me.
the one remaining pill kept for a year ( ..f you all),
it confirmed her comittment to being without for. but it served her as a totally personal new life, a good by!!
just great the whole series, occasionally over the top, but the addiction gets primary attention.
thanks Eddie Falco for a marvellous show.

6120613,5,B00GWJIDFW,Easily one of the best TV series of the last 5 years (maybe ever). Long Live Nurse Jackie (and Zoey)!!!,1397606400,,103,4.2
6120614,4,B00GWJIDFW,"I think they have hired new writers and/or directors. The people, especially Zoey and Jackie, seem more real. They're lines seem more like something a real person would say.",1397520000,,173,5.0
6120615,5,B00GWJIDFW,Great cast and a great story. I enjoyed the fact that it's a drama that also can make you laugh.,1397433600,,96,3.85
6120616,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Whether you loved her as Carmella Soprano, or Nurse Jackie, the story line and characters in Nurse Jackie are great.  Jackie is someone you know you've known before, either loved or hated, but probably, at one point in your life, actually had a nurse like her in your life and you were grateful and thought the place you were at was great because of one person.  It is awesome to watch Peter Faccinelli play the neurotic ER doc with the Tourette Syndrome-like disorder of grabbing Jackie's breast when nervous...He meets his match tho when an equally neurotic new ER doc, who is female, grabs his crotch when he accidentally grabs her boob...I don't know, throw in some east coast attitude and its awesome!",1397347200,,706,4.7317073170731705
6120617,5,B00GWJIDFW,I love this series and can never get enough of it. The casting is phenomenal with characters with depth and intriguing complexity.,1397347200,,130,4.954545454545454

6120619,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Done with intelligence, creativity and sensitivity. In other words is way better than 99% of the &%$#$ on television. OK?",1397174400,,121,5.1
6120620,5,B00GWJIDFW,Really loved this season even though it has lost a little of its comic relief. The teenage daughter woes is something I can sympathize with.  Of course the supporting cast is spectacular and can't give them enough props.,1396915200,,220,4.7894736842105265
6120621,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Edie Falco is by far the very best deversfied actress; she has played some many different roles in her career, and always hits the mark.
And so Nurse Jackie is a favorite of mine, I not only watch the series, I then order the season, it's always great to watch with family and friends.",1396915200,,285,4.296296296296297
6120622,5,B00GWJIDFW,"It's always interesting to see what kind of mess she get's herself into. Being an RN I can relate to most of her dilemmas!!
Love the series.",1396742400,,140,4.222222222222222

6120624,5,B00GWJIDFW,I watched this whole season in one day.  I cannot wait till the next season.  Nurse Jackie great show.  I love it.,1396396800,,114,4.090909090909091

6120626,5,B00GWJIDFW,Great cast that does a real good job. Still miss the Sopranos so this is a touch of it with Jackie.,1395964800,,99,3.761904761904762
6120627,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Nurse Jackie is one of the few series that I've ever watched that seems to get better with each passing season.  Although the main character is somewhat controversial, she says and does some of the things that health care workers can empathize with.",1395878400,,249,4.790697674418604
6120628,5,B00GWJIDFW,Great show.  I have bought every season.  A little over-dramatic but very entertaining.,1395878400,,87,5.615384615384615

6120632,5,B00GWJIDFW,"It is amazing how the years have flown by and the girls have gotten older and maybe - maybe things are getting better for Jackie! Great dark humor, well written and acted.",1395619200,,171,4.375
6120633,5,B00GWJIDFW,"Great ending! My only regret is that they only air eight shows per season, so the price tag for the DVD's is quite high. The digital versions may be cheaper, and if you have a prime account, it'll be free one of these days; probably sooner than later. Now that CBS owns SHOWTIME the content will be more readily available at better prices.",1395532800,,339,4.396825396825397
6120634,1,B00GWJIDFW,I purchased this one episode - my first Amazon instant video - to try it out on my Mac. I installed the Silverlight plugin on my Firefox browser. The episode would not play. I reset my video preferences to Silverlight; the episode still would not play. I reset the preferences to Adobe Flash Player: the episode would not play! I purchased the same episode from iTunes and 30 seconds later I was watching it.,1395446400,,408,4.527027027027027

6120636,5,B00GWJIDFW,Another great season for an entertaining series. Drama and comedy combined. Really enjoy this series and look forward to season 6.,1395273600,,130,5.238095238095238
6120637,4,B00GWJIDFW,"Waited and waited and finally it came out ........Love the show and think it's so true. Work and little crap everyday makes you strong. Did not believe the ending. It was expensive though. I think Amazon when you start buying a series should offer more of a return customer discount ,",1395273600,,284,4.588235294117647
6120638,4,B00GWJIDFW,"I have bought every season of Nurse Jackie over the years, and watch them in just a few days. Although I wish the seasons were longer, the show never disappoints.  And a shocker ending--she what????? Oh well, have to wait til I see the next season to find out why. These characters are all so likable and 'human,' with their flaws and idiosyncrisies. But would I want them treating me in the hospital? You bet.",1395187200,,410,4.466666666666667
