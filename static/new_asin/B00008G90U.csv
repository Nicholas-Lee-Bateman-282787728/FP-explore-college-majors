7984096,5,B00008G90U,"I have always wanted to DJ via turntables, but never found the opportunity to start and learn. I bought this dvd per the customer reviews and as a way new beginner at this, with no knowledge of the equipment specifics, this dvd was very helpful. I can't wait to buy my first DJ equipment and start practicing. I will definitely buy more instructional dvds from this guy in the future.",1256083200,,384,4.5
7984097,5,B00008G90U,"This is a really great dvd for those who are just starting off, gives you information to get yourself going.  Teaches you what equipemtn to buy, and what additional gear you need.  Good item, but not for advance users.",1183507200,3,218,4.564102564102564
7984098,3,B00008G90U,"Turntable Technique is a pretty decent guide for aspiring DJs that have never ever laid hands on a pair of tables and a mixer. I think the DVD would be informative for novices.  They also go over many scratches like flares, stabs, the crab, and a couple others.

There is a book and record set of the same name and it's basically a retread of the DVD. DJing jargon gets defined and it shows you how to count beats, read music notes, and how to wire and set up your own station. It also explains all the parts and functions of a turntable. Just like the book, all of this gets broken down to the most elementary of terms, so it's pretty easy to follow.

The problem with this set is the fact that it's practically useless to anyone that has so much as set up a pair of tables and a mixer. I bought  this DVD, as well as the book and record set, in hopes of learning something that I didn't know already. While it wasn't a total loss, I highly recommend that anyone doing this for more than a year pass on this. I would recommend DJ Qbert's Do It Yourself Skratching DVD over this instead.

With that being said, I don't think anything beats standing next to another DJ and just watching what they do. I learned by going to shows, watching other DJs, and brainstorming with my DJ buddies. I'd recommend that approach over any DVD or book.",1172880000,11,1336,4.264822134387352
7984099,3,B00008G90U,"I was going to buy turntables from my roommate's girlfriend's brother, but then he broke up with her and i wrote a nasty story about her online and she found it so I didn't get to buy turntables, but then my girlfriend bought me turntables for my birthday. So I bought this DVD to learn how to do everything... it's pretty informational on set-up and the basics, but just boring as hell and slow. I couldn't even stand watching it... his samples are pretty boring too, running trumpet loops over techno beats... looping breaks, etc. This DVD would be good for learning basic techo blends. As I'm looking more towards spinning hip hop and scratching... i'd recommend DJ Qbert's Do It Yourself Scratching DVD. It's great.",1139529600,2,719,4.714285714285714
7984100,5,B00008G90U,"The guy on this DVD is a professor at the Berkeley school of music.  It shows.  He is excellent at explaining things.  He breaks them down in to small steps and makes them very easy to understand. You can tell he has been teaching for a long time.

In the section on creative mixing, he shows many ways to combine two records. He even takes the snare from one record, or just a horn section, and flies them in over the other record. This got me thinking in totally new ways about my mixes.

There is a lot about setting up that you can get from the owners manuals, but the scratching stuff is also very clear and well done.

I wish the professor would put out a DVD with QBert---his clarity of teaching combined with QBert's chops would be awesome!",1099008000,23,748,4.2695035460992905
