182581,5,1560395907,"For those of us who grew up watching the series ,it will take you back to your childhood! I have always been a fan of the series(but not with Scrappy Doo Avois those if you can! ). This video has behind the scenes  with the gang telling about the gang past and other stuff! My favorite  episode on this tape is ""Jeeper,It's the Creeper"" in which the  gang is at a dance and the ghosts ruins it! This episode also features a  song  in it! I cannot remeber the song at the moment but it's on the Scooby  Doo Ultimate Snack Track cd! Buy this video if you want to go back your  youth of just love the series!
Please read my other reviews posted  thought out the site! Thanks Have a nice day!",954288000,4,688,4.082089552238806
182582,5,1560395907,"If you grew up watching Scooby Doo like I did, you have to have this video. Its all classic Scooby. No Scrappy stuff in this one. As a Scooby Fan and collector, I HIGHLY recommend this video....",950227200,3,194,4.27027027027027
182583,4,1560395907,"We got this video about a month ago and my little daughter seems to watch it at least once a day.  I, too, indulge, bringing back great memories of my late '70s/early '80s childhood--Scooby was on every day at 4 PM, but man  did we dislike it when Scrappy came into the picture!  This video, however,  is just Scooby and the gang, enhanced by ""Behind the Scenes""  segments which are a riot--I'm surprised none of the other reviewers said  anything about them.  As far as the episodes, by far the best is the one  about the Creeper.  Just imagine, the likelihood that an older bank  president would dress up as a Frankenstein lookalike and run around saying  ""Greeper!"" while jumping out of second-story windows!  It's also  a scream to see Thelma lose her glasses, and instead of helping her, Fred  and Daphne (what a babe) take off running when they see the Creeper.  It's  also slightly violent, as Scooby kicks the Creeper with both hind legs as  hard as he can.  And I love that song they play called ""Daydreamer,  head in the sand.""  As for the other episodes, the only other great  one is the one about the puppets.  Listen closely: every time a character  says ""Pietro,"" they pronounce it differently.  I have a theory  that each character's voice overdubs were done on different days, and none  of the actors knew how to pronounce it.  Finally, the video ends with a  cartoon by the Power Puff girls which I feel is out-of-place.  It has too  much of a ""hip, '90s"" feel to it and might not be appropriate for  really young children.  Why was it included?  Who knows, some A&R guy  probably suggested it.",943747200,9,1611,4.536842105263158
182584,5,1560395907,"Now, I know Scooby fans voted for the episodes on this tape, but couldn't they have selected a bit better?  'The Back Stage Rage' here is by far the best selection here and the other three pale compared to this.  In what was  unusual for the '69 show this features very good plot/mystery elements  (compared to the superior '76 shows that followed) and builds very well  from the opening on the lonely street with Shaggy and Scooby.  'Hassle in  the Castle' - pass. Can we see a plot here or just endless chase sequences?  Good music and castle artwork, though.  'A Clue for Scooby Doo' is good  just for the scene where they talk to the old sea dog.  The design of this  character is just what makes Scooby, Scooby.  A classic stereotype of the  old dock worker and very creepy!  This entire episode was re-worked and  bettered in the '76 show 'The Diablo Doero'.  The 'Creeper' episode is  again, one long chase, and great if you don't want a plot to get in the way  of the fleeing.  It is a shame they couldn't have done more with the  character design.  On future tapes could we have some of the great episodes  from the '76 series 'The Scooby Doo Show'?  I'm talking about 'The Phantom  Racer', 'It's that Geezer, Ebeneser!' and 'The Menace in Venice'.  It are  these episodes that make Scooby the best animated show - ever.  Oh, and  release on DVD as well next time.",934848000,2,1373,4.423387096774194

182586,3,1560395907,Just did not like the episodes included. I do not let my kids watch any witches or wizards n one of the episodes involved a witch. Good price n quick shipping though for Christmas. I will kist have to find another dvd with more appropriate episodes.,1454630400,,249,4.434782608695652

182594,5,1560395907,This was purchased for my niece for Christmas. She is a Scooby fan and she loved it. I wasn't able to watch it with her but she's had no complaints. Came quickly. Great cost. I'd buy from this seller again.,1394755200,,206,4.175
182595,2,1560395907,This is my daughter's fav movie I was unaware that it ONLY comes with 2 episodes not like the VHS. I sure have read the fine print,1382572800,,130,3.8518518518518516

182600,5,1560395907,I like the choices on DVD's at Amazon new or used they have always come in great shape and with different prices so I can decide what I am comfortable paying for them. they show up at my home quickly which is a great help.,1330905600,,222,3.9555555555555557
182601,2,1560395907,According to the description above-this DVD is supposed to have 4 Scooby-Doo episodes as well as a Powerpuff Girls bonus. The DVD I received only had 2 Scooby-Doo episodes and that is all-very disappointing!!!!!,1285718400,,211,5.235294117647059

182603,4,1560395907,"I wanted a few episodes to pop into the dvd player once in a while (nostalgic trip down Saturday morning lane), and I didn't feel the need to buy an entire season box set of this show. A little goes a long way.

  This is perfect because it features just a few shows for a quick Scooby fix.",1150588800,3,290,3.9655172413793105

182605,3,1560395907,My children love all the Scooby Doo DVDs.  The only problem I have is that on three seperate Scooby Doo series DVDs we own they all three have one or two of the same episodes.  A Clue for Scooby Doo and Hassle in the Castle are repeated way too much.,1140739200,,250,3.98
182606,5,1560395907,"If your purchase the complete 25 episodes of seasons 1 & 2, Scobby-Doo Where Are You? then the four episodes on this dvd are already included there.  I agree with other reviews that we do not need several dvds with repeat episodes.  Until they release newer material we will continue to have this issue.  The episodes are 1) Hassle in the Castle, 2) A Clue for Scooby-Doo, 3)The Backstage Rage, and 4) Jeepers, It's the Creeper.",1105228800,18,428,4.605263157894737
182607,5,1560395907,"Warner Brothers should put the episode with the villain called Spooky Spector on DVD, I believe that Scrappy Doo is in the episode so it is not one of the original episodes.  ...  I have been searching for this episode for years it is my favorite one.  Thank you.",1080000000,,263,4.326530612244898
182608,1,1560395907,"As most people have stated, this DVD has 2 or 3 episodes that are already available on other Scooby compilations.  We fans have to figure out how to petition Warner if we want to see other episodes released!",1056931200,5,207,4.447368421052632
182609,5,1560395907,"This is a super Scooby Doo DVD. This DVD has some great episodes. Jeepers, It's The Creepers is a super episode. I strongly suggest buying this fantastic DVD. I plan on buying it.",1050364800,,179,4.454545454545454
182610,1,1560395907,"These mysteries are so great, they have already been released on DVD!  Warners must hope you will keep buying the same titles for your kids as long as they are re-packaged.  Sooner or later they will know they are getting the same stories.  As for us adult fans who grew up on these, we already know.  There are at least 13 original mysteries still not released on DVD, but Warners just wants to keep giving us the same 13 already released.
I'm glad I looked up the titles before buying this rehash DVD.",1048464000,15,503,4.376344086021505
182611,3,1560395907,"Actually, I give this video tape 3 1/2 stars. It belongs in any Scooby fan's collection. The FIRST episode is a little slow, but it offers some nice scenery. And the underwater action is something we don't see in every episode. The mislead is well placed, and Captain Cutler's (widow?) is an interesting guest star. Shaggy's comical moments are well placed: ""I thought that rock looked suspicious."" The SECOND episode is one of their finest. Rarely do spooky moments and comical moments go so well hand in hand. It starts normal enough with the gang on a cruise, and they get stranded on a spooky island. Like many good Scooby episodes, we know the ghost is probably fake. But, for a few moments here and there, we are at least allowed to accept the possibility of them being real. Even the level headed Fred shows some fear in this episode, and Velmah carries the gang in a moment of panic. The disappearance of Daphne causes some suspense. The villain himself is more amusing than repulsive in this episode. (Great!) And Shaggy's killer one liners are there. GHOST: ""I warned you to leave. Now you will all pay."" SHAGGY: ""I'll pay! I'll pay! How about 4 bits?"" In all honesty, this episode either keeps us laughing or makes us nervous. It is one of the best Scooby episodes out there. There is even a nice deviation from most Scooby episodes. The villain is an unusually good loser, and he offers some charm. The THIRD episode is yet another great one. It has a frightening realism to it and allows us to ask ourselves: 'What's more frightening? Ghosts or economics?' This episode is constructed the way a great book would be. The mention of the Creeper, some well placed irony, and his appearance. We are given time to wonder why he is after a paper. The Hermit is an interesting guest star. We get to see how generous Scooby and Shaggy can be when it comes to heading the clean up committee. (Cleaning up the food that is.) Shaggy's one liners are also there: ""I know whose back you're on, but whose side are you on?"" We also get to see Scooby and Shaggy avoid food for a change: ""I just remembered, I'm on a squirrel free diet."" Without ruining the ending for you, it is very PLAUSIBLE AND REALISTIC. Spooky moments, don't always come from ghost or witches. They also come when something is plausible and we can see it happening. If you like the Creeper, you will be pleased to know that he comes back for another round in ""Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase."" The FINAL episode is on the weaker side. There simply are not enough characters, and you'll probably know what is going on right away. The creepy use of puppets compensates a little, but this episdoe really falls short of Scooby's usual strength and charm. FINAL WORD: One weak episode does not make this a bad tape. The other 3 episodes make this tape a vital part of any Scooby library.",1010880000,,2850,4.535922330097088
182612,5,1560395907,"By far one of the best scooby movies i've seen.  It features A Clue for Scooby Doo, Hassle In The Castle, Backstage Rage, and Jeepers It's the Creeper! These are four great episodes, so if you haven't seen them yet, get this video! You won't regret it.",996624000,,252,4.361702127659575
182613,5,1560395907,"When I heard that this collection video was going to be released I eagerly awaited it's arrival at local retail stores, even though I have seen each episode numerous times.  But I didn't OWN them!  Especially the episode  ""Jeepers, It's the Creeper!"" which is one of, if not my all time  favorite Scooby Doo episode(s).  But each story is great in its own right.  In ""A Clue For Scooby-Doo!"" a ghostly deep sea diver keeps the  gang and Scooby on their toes.  In ""Hassle in the Castle"" the  gang finds an island castle and its resident spirit.  In ""Jeepers,  It's the Creeper!"" a green, Frankensteinish hunchback chases Scooby  and Co. in order to keep money he has stolen from the local bank.  And in  ""The Backstage Rage"" a spooky puppetmaster tries to pull off a  counterfeiting operation, but not with Scooby around!  All in all this is  fun Scooby Doo viewing, with extra between episode footage and a bonus  Powerpuff Girls cartoon this is a surefire hit with kids, minus commercial  interuption.  If you are a fan of Scooby Doo this is a very necessary  purchase for your video collection.  This is one Scooby Snack you can't  afford to miss!",963705600,10,1149,4.635
