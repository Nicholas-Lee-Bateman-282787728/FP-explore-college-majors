7364111,5,B013FJFVII,Really creative film with a good amount of splatter. The actors do a great job in the film too! Would definitely recommend watching.,1444694400,,132,4.782608695652174

7364113,4,B013FJFVII,"This is a decent sci-fi horror film. A couple of recognizable people in it with Mitchel Musso from Hannah Montana and Jamie Kennedy. It's obviously a smaller-budget film, but the actors/writers do a nice job of keeping the tension high throughout...which is hard to do because it all takes place on a small section of beach. I enjoyed the old-school feel of it.",1444694400,2,361,4.746031746031746

7364115,4,B013FJFVII,"AKA Blood Sand. This is a remake of Blood Beach. This version is better. I have both and compared the two. The premise is better and more mysterious. In Blood Beach, people continue to go to the beach regardless of the published danger proving people are both stupid and gullible. The only comedy relief is the sheriff's deputy who won't listen to the teens left on the beach and ends up in extreme danger. He was so busy accusing the teens of drugs, he didn't listen to their complaint. One more dumb LEO in the movies.",1529366400,,520,4.427083333333333

7364125,3,B013FJFVII,"Apparently ""Vegas rules"" means you can't carry your cellphone. So after a wild night of partying on the beach (under strict ""Vegas rules""), a group of teens awake the next morning to learn that the beach sand is deadly to the touch. Without phones, they can't call any outsiders for help, so they're forced to fend for themselves. This premise is so ridiculous it feels like a bad SNL sketch. To the credit of the filmmakers though, they bravely played this premise with complete seriousness (that is, until Jamie Kennedy shows up to put on a little one-man comedy show). The seriousness makes this oddity somewhat interesting. The special effects are super cheap CGI (of the made-for-TV SyFy variety), but that's forgivable I guess. I'd recommend watching this for free on Prime, but I couldn't see myself paying $21.72 for the DVD.",1528416000,,833,4.873239436619718

7364129,3,B013FJFVII,"First the bad. It is a ridiculous story. Something hatches from a slimy, nasty egg that two geniuses find near the beach where a party is in progress being promoted under ""Vegas rules"", meaning that what happens on the Beach stays on the beach, so the WIC (wiseass in charge) collects all the phones and locks them in the trunk (big problem). We never see the creature (until the last few moments, and then only a part), but that is not unusual, (not optimal, but not unusual). However, in this case, one cannot even imagine what the creature looks like, or how it manages to occupy what is perhaps an acre of land occupying only the interstitial space between the tiny grains of sand, or how it manages to produce carnivorous hairs, or why it eats birds, people, and hot dogs. Perhaps I am overthinking this.

Now the good. - the girls are beautiful, the beach is beautiful, the creature is beautiful (glowing and fluorescing), even the boys are beautiful. the only exception is Gilbert, a rather plump fellow, who spends is stuck in a trash can. However, Gilbert is very, very funny. He reminds me of one of the Fat Boys. I don't know what every happened to the ""Fat Boys"" but thy made two hilarious movies that should have been considered by the Academy",1527984000,2,1256,4.557522123893805

7364139,4,B013FJFVII,"For fluff this is okay, and I LOVE the ending only because it actually had an ending versus the usual horror fade to black with no closure. There are some glaring errors (why is the trunk of the Saab incredibly hot but the hood is cool, why doesn't the Beach Patrol SUV have a radio, why did the one chick think it was okay to lie on her boyfriend's stomach where all the acid was, where is there any beach in California that is deserted 24/7, etc.) but it works. Could it have been a better movie? Yes, definitely. I guess the absolute best part is that you honestly don't know who is going to die, so the movie is 'egalitarian' in that sense.",1526428800,2,644,4.201612903225806

The premise sounds horrendous, but the performances and the variety of ways the characters die really raise the quality of this. The acting is quite good, and the movie held my interest the entire time. The special effects are very good at the beginning (both the gore and the monster), but get more cheesy and less convincing as the film goes on. But at the beginning, they really are quite good.

7364159,3,B013FJFVII,"Pretty much what I expected with a movie like this. Not the kind of movie you should start watching with high expectations. As long as you know what you're getting with this kind of movie then it's alright. I did end up getting bored near the end and skipped a bit. I wouldn't ever suggest buying this movie but it's free for Prime right now and if you're bored and like to watch movies like this then go for it.

Things I liked:
- The acting was actually a bit better than most of the acting you see in movies like this. I was surprised to see a few of the actors were ones I've seen before.
- I kind of liked the idea behind the movie.
- There was some nudity but I feel like they didn't go overboard with it like in some movies like this.

Minor non-specific SPOILERS BELOW that bugged me about this movie (just my personal opinion so take these with a grain of salt) :

- The number of times someone said ""look at me"" or something similar as a way of comforting someone. Might be just me but I feel like if they said it enough for me to actually think ""wow they're using that line a lot"" then they're probably saying it too much.
- The jealousy and fighting between some of the characters was poorly introduced and it seemed to randomly be thrown in as a way of filling time at very odd moments; if you're fighting to survive or you just narrowly avoided death I feel like the last thing you'd be doing is worrying about relationship problems.
- And lastly, there were multiple ways of improving their chances that seemed pretty obvious but honestly that's the case with most movies like this so I wasn't surprised.",1499212800,2,1619,4.267100977198697
7364160,3,B013FJFVII,Not bad.  Pretty enjoyable movie. Decent soundtrack as well.,1498953600,,60,5.666666666666667

7364162,3,B013FJFVII,"Yeah, ok for free prime but wouldn't pay for it.  Not the worst prime horror but not the best either.  Ok for a rainy day in or just bored and looking for something a little freaky and pretty dumb to watch.",1498694400,,206,4.0
7364163,2,B013FJFVII,"THE SAND opens w/ a large group of college age young people at a big beach bash, having fun and consuming gallons of alcohol. The next morning, only eight hung-over party animals remain. Almost immediately, horrible deaths occur, caused by ""something in the sand"". They can't call for help, due to someone's genius idea to take everyone's cell phone the night before! Now, no one can touch the sand, leaving the survivors stranded in a car, a lifeguard tower, and -one poor guy- stuck in a barrel! Can these captives find a way out of this fearsome fix? If the plot sounds rather thin, wellll..., that's because it is. THE SAND is -sort of- a second cousin to BLOOD BEACH (1980), minus John Saxon, and featuring some very cheeeze-fabulous, CGI creature and gore effects. While the acting isn't altogether terrible, the dialogue is just plain dumb at times. The best, funniest part comes when a beach patrol officer arrives. He's hilarious!

7364177,4,B013FJFVII,"Saw this last night on cable, though it had the title ""Blood Sand"" instead. You can also find Blood Sand here on Amazon, but the reviews are all talking about a Rudy Valentino movie even though the poster and actors listing are for this 2016 horror romp. The poster on IMDB for the ""The Sand"" is terribly cheezy, this one is much better.

Watched this my wife, who was really worried that the kids were not going to make it off the beach. She kept grabbing my arm and yelling at the screen, ""Don't do it!"" or ""Be careful!' or ""No! No! No!"".

This movie is a lot of fun. The acting is good/believable and generally the film looks well-made even with some low budget CGI effects. If the acting falls down a little I'm tending to blame the script. They do some silly/stupid things with predictable results. The direction could have be better. When they're testing the limits of the kill-zone we can't actually see how far away safety is. Felt bad for the Gilbert actor. That didn't look like much fun at all.

The ending is a little mixed-up and is disappointing compared to the rest of the film.

Cynthia Murell needs more work. She's the best part of this movie and is believably playing someone 12 years younger. Dumb Hollywood keeps casting homely no-talents when this gorgeous lady is available?",1469318400,,1297,4.553648068669528
7364178,2,B013FJFVII,"So I was reminiscing for some reason about Blood Beach and wound up with The Sand. If it ever becomes available for Prime, it's certainly worth that, but doubtful for a rental. It doesn't lack an interesting premise, but the movie feels longer than it is, dragging at times and lacking characters with virtually any redeeming qualities. The entire film takes place on an abandoned stretch of beach where a small group of teens (or adults acting like teens) awake after a night of partying to discover they are the only ones remaining from the throng. There are a couple in a lifeguard tower, a few in a car that, of course won't run, and one inexplicably stuck upright in a barrel...and he and the situation are both insufferable. They act like teenagers, with the usual relationship drama meant to create tension, that ultimately makes the viewer wish for their their merciful and quick execution by the only interesting part of the flick, the prickly tendrils that strip the skin from unsuspecting beach goers. There are certainly movies that are far less entertaining, and if that's your idea of a successful movie, this might be for you. Otherwise, you might want to pass and find something equally mediocre on prime that creates less buyers remorse.",1468627200,8,1254,4.837209302325581

7364186,4,B013FJFVII,"The beginning has a beach party, with Very Drunk Spring Breakers.  They Party all night, and find a strange looking object on the beach.

The following morning the beach is deserted, except for a handful of partyers, who'd passed out on a table, in convertible car, and in a lifeguard station.  They awake and look around. They quickly find that things had changed since they passed out.

Touching the sand had become lethal.  Once bare skin touched the sand, a person was immobilized, and then pulled beneath the sand.  The sand itself appeared to eat people.

The survivors quickly investigate their situation. That object that had been on the beach had been an egg, which had hatched in the night.  Small, hairlike, barbs come out of the sand, those are venomous, and hold someone in place - so they can pulled under and eaten.  With that realization, came a horrifying insight.  They'd originally assumed they'd been left there by the other partyers.  It suddenly seemed more likely that everyone else had been eaten in the night.

Because they'd been at a beach party, they were bare foot.  They couldn't leave the car or tower.  Also they were still in swim suits, or little more, so the sun and heat was almost as dangerous as the sand.  They couldn't stay where they were, nor could they leave.  Several failed plans lead to many deaths. An arrogant beach patrol arrives and is quickly eaten.  The few who survive manage to make a path to his truck, and wait it out in there.

The next morning the beast was gone, but still alive.  It was swimming threw the ocean.  Heading towards another beach, one with far more Prey.",1459641600,,1628,4.6456140350877195

7364188,4,B013FJFVII,"Surprisingly good for a low budget horror film.  Acting was decent.  Characters drew me in so that I actually cared what happened to the characters.  There was a good tension of suspense held through out.  The special effects were good and there was just the right amount of gore for a horror flick.

Of course there were the stupid decisions where you just scream common sense advice to the screen.  However every scary movie has that, doesn't it?  Good concept and suspense throughout.  It had the ""Jaws"" vibe throughout.

I won't tell you that the characters didn't annoy me, they did, I won't tell you that they do stupid things, they do, I won't tell you that the ""monster"" has no origin or explanation, it doesn't. Jamie Kennedy has a cameo as a beach patrol cop and he was too far over the top and just made me want to fast forward thru his part. Those are the negatives BUT I did actually wind up liking this movie. it is a nod to the more old fashioned ""kill the teenager movies"". But it is different enough to keep you watching. Consider too that the whole movie was shot on one beach, budget was small. Oh, the ""monster"" bad effects. I won't say anything about the usual stuff either.

7364220,4,B013FJFVII,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

After I watched THE SAND, I trekked around the Web a bit to see what other people thought about it.  I personally loved it; the film embodies every single thing that attracts me to creature-features.  Interestingly, however, reviews from other sources are pretty mixed.  Im not sure what these folks were expecting, but you cant go into a movie like THE SAND and expect an Academy Award Winner.  You have to take films like this for what they are:  simple, gory fun.  If you enjoy films like these (as I do), then you're in for a real treat here.

The premise of this film is so simple, and yet that is part of what makes it so much fun.  Theres no big setup, no elaborate plan that has to fall into place.  Just a party on the beach that results in fatal consequences.

THE SAND is shot well and looks like a bigger-budget picture onscreen.  The single set location allows the story to progress quickly without the need to highlight the differences in locales.  I greatly enjoy films that can pack so much intensity and terror into one physical spot, such as DEVIL (in the elevator), FROZEN (the Anchor Bay horror flick set on the ski-lift, NOT the Disney version), and PONTYPOOL.

The acting in THE SAND is pretty good, although I have to confess some of the casting decisions surprise me.  For example, Hector David Jr, who plays Vance, has been in several incarnations of the popular Power Rangers franchise.  Also, the likable every-guy Mitch is played by Disney-series alum Mitchel Musso, who fans will recognize from HANNAH MONTANA and PAIR OF KINGS.  These are not bad casting choices, as everybody does a great job with their roleshowever it is interesting to see these guys in roles outside of kids shows.

The special effects are really the only negative aspect of THE SAND, and they are not really that bad.  They don't look crappy, however it is very obvious in many scenes that they are computer generated.  As Ive said before in previous reviews, I understand budget constraints can force a production crew to shy away from practical effectshowever, they should be a primary focus for a horror film.  Still, the effects in THE SAND look decent enough and are very passable.

THE SAND is a win for me, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good creature-feature.  This lower-budget gem is a lot of fun, and it would make a great addition to your Halloween viewing.",1445990400,7,2454,4.6036866359447
7364221,3,B013FJFVII,"The film opens with a beach party collecting cell phones setting the scene for isolation. A large object is found on the beach. In the morning, the only people left are those that weren't touching the sand. They soon figure out the sand eats living things and they need to stay off. The phones are in the trunk of a car that won't start because the lights were left on. There is a boyfriend issue that doesn't distract us from the sand eating people with blood and gore effects.

Acting could have been better, likewise for the dialogue. Film needed to be lighter to compliment the cheese. 2 1/2 stars
