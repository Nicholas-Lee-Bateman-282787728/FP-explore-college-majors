8209425,3,B000F50W4O,"I love Dredg. They are one of today's greatest working bands. They deserve a larger audience. But this video is obviously for promoting ""Catch Without Arms"" in record stores. It is only 29 minutes long, and all the songs are from ""Catch..."". And honestly, the mixes on this DVD are a little vocal heavy. They lack punch. This is not a concert video in the traditional sense. It is footage of a few songs from a concert, not an entire concert by any means. This video is for a die-hard collector. I wouldn't pay anything more than $10 for this DVD if I knew better.

BTW, Amazon has 2 listings for this DVD with slightly different titles but with big price differences. Research before purchase.",1286064000,,694,4.552
8209426,5,B000F50W4O,"Early on, critics often described Dredg as a metal group. However, the quartet has since matured into a hard-edged indie-rock ensemble that seeks diversity and refinement in its music.

On this DVD, the band favors highly orchestrated parts, dense guitar riffs, and powerful drumming. Each song is based around memorable vocal hooks and sensitive lyrical content.

Many of their songs have a searching quality to them. Despite the sheer force of the music, these songs are ultimately marked by well constructed melodies and intriguing harmonic underpinnings. This is due in part to singer Gavin Hayes, who sounds more like U2's Bono than a metal screecher, and his vocals move effortlessly over Mark Engles's syncopated guitar.

This DVD helps give an inside look to a young band that still has much more in store for its fans.",1170979200,4,827,5.0661764705882355
