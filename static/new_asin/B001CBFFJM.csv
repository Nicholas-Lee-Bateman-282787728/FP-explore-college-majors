8286499,1,B001CBFFJM,"Tom Lubin is a criminally fraudulent individual who holds many aliases and his mainstay earnings arise from his associating his bio and past works with accomplished recording studio engineers, printing industry distributors, falsely purports to teach aboriginals in Western Australia and a list of other false persona to promote books he pens. In August 2015 he libeled a bonafide working screenwriter who is also a barred legal U.S. attorney and entertainment industry longtime producer who questioned his credentials and his attributions and stated affiliations with Western Australia Media, UCSF, and other entities in a UCLA public forum. Under these legal and equitable queries for verification and corroboration of his preferred credentials he libeled the law abiding citizen screenwriter and documentary filmmaker a PEDOPHILE and refused to take down the pubic post from a nationally accredited state university (UCLA). The defamed screenwriter has sought and obtained an open criminal investigation into Tom Lubin's proffered affiliations in Australia, Singapore, The United States and other areas. It is worthy of note that while this personna Tom Lubin purports to advocate for aboriginal rights, his latest screenplay Footy Man is in reality a thinly guised hate piece against Australian aboriginals and their cultures intending to force them into further removal from tribal lands and protecting their cultures. Anyone doing commerce with this Tom Lubin should be advised that he is currently under domestic US criminal investigation by the Department of Homeland Security, the C.I.A, the N.S.A., Interpol and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies including defense agencies abroad because the person he libeled is an veteran from a wholly military family in the United States and his libelous statements (still not retracted nor remedied) have caused damages and unjust enrichment to this personna Tom Lubin to the detriment and permanent harm to those affiliated with the libeled victim due to their security clearances and lifetime public service employments and professions within the DOD, the DOJ, the FBI, and other agencies to be at risk for losing said clearance due to these statements. Further Mr. Lubin with malice of forethought intended to cause harm and to blacklist the screenwriter he libeled with the entertainment industry in America and abroad by his intentional statements given that the work he commented on publicly without invitation, license, ownership, court order and/or Act of official governance (Federal/state/local) was, is and continues to be intended to blacklist and cause ongoing harm to this screenwriter and brand. Once the criminal investigations and foreseeable subsequent prosecutions and regulatory agencies are exhausted, then the defamed screenwriter has already set in motion civil proceedings and petitioned for censure of Tom Lubin from the World Court for this overt attempt at censorship and blacklisting of a writer who vetted his background and found mass discrepancies as law enforcement have similarly found. Govern yourselves accordingly.",1447200000,,3112,5.637526652452026
8286500,5,B001CBFFJM,"Years ago,I bought the VHS tapes:)of Tom Lubin's Shaping Your Sound Series and I'm glad I did!
The lessons are essential to creating good recordings and understanding audio equipment whether you're recording with
digital or analog gear. The Studio Seconds DVD(and book if you can get that too)is a great course.
Everyone in your studio should learn the business practices - especially if you're not locking down the
good paying clients or just can't seem to get things together. I highly recommend it!
I still have a Reel to Reel! It was great to get on it and refresh my skills. Thanks Tom!",1325116800,,591,4.747572815533981
