4485726,4,B004W7D1XU,"I really hate titles that are puns unless I create them. ""Joan of Arcadia"" is perhaps the worse pun title. ""Lies in Plain Sight"" deals with Sofia, a blind Latino-American who attends MIT. She was very close to her cousin Eva, who is the apparent victim of a suicide...one where she left no note. Sofia (Martha Higareda) is skeptical and asks questions. Eva has a young sister Alexa (Kendra Jain) who is self centered and seems a bit resentful of Sofia. Eva's mom (Rosie Perez) believes Eva did it to punish her and deals with her grief by cleaning. Yul Vazquez is Eva's diabetic daddy. Benito Martinez is Sofia's father.

Ethan (Chad Michael Murray) was Eva's boyfriend. He makes friends with Sofia. As they talk, Sofia becomes unnerved as things are not what they seem. She discovers her family, including Eva, lied to her to protect her. Early on we find out Eva was scheduled to have an abortion. Eva never brought her her boyfriend. Eva was pregnant, kept it a secret and was going to get an abortion. The boyfriend claims they had broken up and the child was not his. And the family had secrets. At this point the audience has the whole thing figured out and we still have over an hour of movie left. Even a blind person could figure this one out.

The real story is how Sofia, who is blind, goes about to figure out the family secret and how is she going to save her cousin Alexa. At times the movie felt like an after school special, although it was certainly a cut above.

Excellent acting. Good drama.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. adult themes.",1335225600,3,1553,4.49645390070922

8444664,3,B004W7D1XU,"Interesting low budget (although this sort of movie doesn't need a big budget) movie that does something we don't see often, has a lead character with a disability, in this case the character is blind.  Sofia, the bind girl, is played by two actresses Martha Higareda (current time period) and Daniela Bobadilla (flashback to childhood years).  Both actresses do a fairly good job at portraying someone who is blind.  However the two actresses don't greatly resemble each other, the older one has a very prominent nose, and the younger one also seems to be a different race.  At times such as the wake, background soundtrack music is playing really loudly when Sofia is talking to someone like her deceased former best friend's ex boyfriend, which makes it very difficult to hear what is being said.  Why we needed background violins playing  at this stage in the movie was beyond me.

Basically the plot of this one revolves around Sofia flying back to her old home town because Eva her former best friend whose parents took her in like a sister, has committed suicide.  Sofia thought the world of  Eva and often told her as a child she couldn't cope without her.  Sofia wants to understand why her sister like friend killed herself, and soon uncovers some secrets her former bestie had kept from her.  When she discovers that facts don't add up to what her ""sister"" told her was happening back in their childhood days. Even though Sofia may have been better off not knowing what her former bestie was doing to her, she's still determined to find out why Eva took her own life.",1477180800,,1578,4.701818181818182

8444668,4,B004W7D1XU,"This is an intriguing and different type of mystery as the lead character is blind yet quite able to ""see"" what others have missed.  Sofia Delgado (very well played as an adult by actress Martha Higareda and another actress for her ""younger self"") returns home from college due to the sudden and unexpected suicide of her cousin and childhood best friend. Sofia is blind from birth but capable of getting around on her own while her heightened other senses allow her to make breakthrough discoveries overlooked by professional investigators. Many questions abound: Why did her cousin commit suicide? Why was no suicide note left behind? Why did the relationship between her cousin and her boyfriend (also well played by Chad Michael Murray of ""One Tree Hill"" fame) go sour for no apparent reason in recent months? Why is the younger sister of her deceased cousin constantly moody and overreactive even given the upsetting circumstances?  Why did Sophia's cousin make an appointment to see a doctor shortly before her suicide? With the help of Murray, Sofia slowly but surely pieces together various pieces of information, some of which she gleans from her knowledge of her late cousin's behavior and the way they interacted in their
youth. Revelation upon revelation follows until the stunning but perhaps not totally unexpected climactic conclusion.  At one point, Sophia's relentless pursuit to find the truth and her unflinching doggedness almost cost her her life as well as a possible permanent alienation with her own family. Yet she persists, and the reality behind the suicide is revealed. The question then is: What will happen next?  Sophia's laser-like search for the truth given her state of blindness and her willingness to put herself in harm's way does strain credulity for the viewer. The lack of insight on the part of a particular family member also does not seem plausible - and that's why I gave this movie only 4 stars.  However, it is a good brain teaser and certainly a notch above ""Murder She Wrote"". Recommended for a variety of reasons.",1442275200,,2062,5.0
