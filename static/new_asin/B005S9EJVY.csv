4869492,5,B005S9EJVY,"This movie is high octane fun! Stallone is in rediculously good shape for 66! I have been a fan of his since i was a child growing up in the 80's. So I have seen a boat load of Stallone's films, the good and the bad. This is one of his best! Don't let the critics fool you, this is a must see if you are a fan of this type of film. My girlfriend who is not a fan, even liked this movie. We found ourselves laughing at the banter between Stallone and his new partner, who happens to be an Asian cop. Stallone is constantly throwing racist comments at him, but it is all in good fun. Stallone's age works to his advantage, his face is chiseled from years of wear and tear, as is the rest of his body. He looks like he was carved out of stone. There is no other actor like him. Christian Slater plays a small, but good roll, as a crooked lawyer. The masquerade ball he throws for his guests is done well. It's fun to watch Stallone creeping around the party wearing a strange mask. I don't want to give a bunch of this film away, so i will just say this. High energy, well acted, well directed, characters are very believable. Go see the movie then buy it when it comes out. It is a keeper! Oh, did I mention Stallone gets into an ax fight?? ""What are we, Vikings?"" Stallone grunts. GREAT FILM!!",1359936000,39,1292,4.090551181102362
4869493,5,B005S9EJVY,"Regardless of the tragedies, I see nothing wrong with the film.  Gun violence is common in a number of movies and remember it's only a movie. Why should a movie be cancelled or delayed because of a few nutcases who can't separate fantasy from reality.  It's tragic what happened this past year, however, I see nothing wrong with this movie. I love action movies and Hollywood won't let a few nutcases cancel or delay movies.  IT'S ONLY A MOVIE!!",1358380800,24,445,4.6075949367088604
4869494,5,B005S9EJVY,So excited to go see this movie looks like alot of fun and Stallone yeah i'm there. For the other review no need to give a movie one star just cause you are offended by the title,1357948800,7,178,3.8378378378378377
4869495,1,B005S9EJVY,Way to go Dark Castle Entertainment. The title of this movie is inappropriate in any time and place generally speaking. But now? Especially now?! After all the recent tragedies? Is this the level of sensitivity you show? And how many of the privileged Hollywood types are now clamoring for gun control after all of the recent violence? Maybe you should look in the mirror. Hollywood hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me. Be decent and find a better title for cryin out loud!,1357776000,5,472,4.7682926829268295

4869540,4,B005S9EJVY,"A sojourn into realistic noir, ""Bullet to the Head"" advances the simple idea that people are who they are and will never change. It follows the story of a hit man whose partner is killed by the same people who executed the partner of an undercover police officer, and the two join up to go get the bad guys. The wrinkle is that this means something different to each of them: the cop wants to arrest them, where Stallone's character wants to simply eliminate them.

Full of action, fast-moving even in dialogue scenes which were tightly edited in the script, this movie includes lots of gratifying violence and over-the-top characters who are nonetheless believable because they think exactly as they must for the role they play. There are also many delicious headshots and moments of callous disregard for the lives of useless people. Perhaps not a perfect date movie, but great for a lazy Sunday afternoon when all you want to see is Darwinism in action, portrayed as vividly as possible.",1508803200,,990,4.7894736842105265
4869541,5,B005S9EJVY,"Loved it. I'm 48 and have been watching Stalone forever. This movie was fresh and novel. Stalone's character was a real dirt ball, but he was the quintessential anti hero. Knocked it out of the park. And the guy is seriously ripped for a guy in his late 60s. Stallone seems to do really well as a legit actor when others are writing and directing.

4869559,3,B005S9EJVY,"All three stars are for the beautiful Jason Mamoa (he plays a villain, but it is hard not to cheer him on) - the rest is pretty awful. Watching Mamoa (especially in the last fight scene) is worth sitting through this short film. An overdone story combined with Stallone's bad delivery are my two main reasons for giving this film no more than three stars. I will actually add a half a star for Stallone being in such spectacular shape for a 67 year old, (I suspect cosmetic surgery, and steroids have a hand in this phenomenon) - still - it is inspiring. Stallone's leading man action days are past (or should be). Stallone, Willis, Schwarzenegger et al are no longer ""action hero leading men."" It is time producers hand over these lead action roles to a  young man (like Mamoa).
.
Christian Slater also has a small role in this - so that might be another reason to watch - Slater has not done anything in a long time. Actor Sung Kwong (the cop that accompanies Stallone throughout the film) is whiny, and underwhelming.",1496880000,,1020,4.513513513513513

4869562,4,B005S9EJVY,"I own this on Blue Ray and I didn't buy it from Amazon so pardon the lack of the ""Verified Purchase"" stamp.

Bullet to the Head is not a top notch super movie, but it proves again that a solid director can make a boring script pretty damn entertaining with top notch talent. I am a big fan of Mamoa, he's not a hit or miss actor, but the poor guy gets trash scripts sometimes and you can't blame him for taking the roles with the pay outs he's offered. He's not as one dimensional as his castings may make him appear, but the guy knows how to sell that intimidating demeanor.

Stallone doesn't need me to stand up for, or explain away anything, the guy is a AAA star no matter the circumstance, he just knows how to be entertaining.

Between the two of them, this 2 star premise becomes a 4 star movie. Good lines, pretty standard story/plot and accompanying happenings, solid acting, and the last fight is gritty in that palpable way that makes you appreciate it even though it's not ""high octane"" and ""over the top"".

Good movie, if you haven't seen it and you're considering it, give it a whirl.

4869564,5,B005S9EJVY,"One of director john woo's best films!  The action sequences are very well shot and choriographed(it's all done with practical effects and stunts.  No bad CGI).  The relationship between the characters was interesting and had me invested(which is more than I can say for most Hollywood films).  And the story was rather interesting as well.  It focuses on a few life long friends who are trying to make some money smuggling cartel in Vietnam during the Vietnam war.  Along the way, all kinds of drama happens.  The main characters fight off a drug cartel, try to smuggle gold out of Vietnam, and learn the ultimate consequences of their actions.  Also, a LOT of people get a bullet in the head.  It's paced very well, and it all leads up to an awsome car chase between the two lead characters( with some excellent stunt work).  This movie is definitely worth the money, especially if your a fan of director John Woo( I also recommend the film ""Hardboiled"".  That was also done by John Woo and in my opinion, it's one of the best action films ever made).  Their is a blu ray release of this film out but in my opinion, it's way too expensive.  Just get this cheaper DVD version.  The picture quality isn't the best, but the movie is so entertaining that you don't notice it.  I should warn you, the film does start off a little disjointed in terms of pacing, but just keep watching and it gets a lot better.  If your into action films that have emotional investment between the characters, then definitely check this film out.",1489622400,,1525,4.571955719557195

4869587,4,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the Head ranks among Stallone's worst performing films at the box office. It's hard to see why. While no classic, Bullet to the Head is a perfectly enjoyable throwback action flick with a strong performance from Stallone and a better than expected showing from Sung Kang. At an economical 90 minutes, the film breezes along well and never slows down. The Blu-Ray looks and sounds good.

Sly in His full Italian mode and when you see him with his shirt of and all I can say is He spent a lot of time in the gym and is ripped at 65  . Sly works well with others and in this film He is working with a cop played by Taylor Kwan after the same guy who killed Sly's partner In this film His adversary is Jason Moma who is moving up assassin . The best part of the film is the axe fight .  This film is far from being Walter Hill or Slys best film but if you want some action and some 48 hr. chit chat between 2 guys on the fence working together .

4869817,4,B005S9EJVY,"Assassin. Fixer. Hit-man. Whatever you call him, the hired gun has been a staple of movies for decades, from Alad Ladd in THIS GUN FOR HIRE to Tom Cruise in COLLATERAL. The best of the breed is certainly Chow Yun Fat as THE KILLER from 1989, and while Sylvester Stallone's latest entry, BULLET TO THE HEAD, is nowhere near that level, it is pretty good.

Stallone stars as a lifelong rulebreaker who only knows one way to live: by making sure other people don't. He does have a few ruleshe only kills people who have it coming (in his eyes), never works with cops, and never shoots women or children. But when a supposedly simple job goes awry and his partner gets killed, Stallone finds himself forced to break one of his basic principles and make a deal with a cop (Sung Kang). Someone is behind the scenes pulling the strings, and Stallone is a loose end they want to cut off.

As its title suggests, BULLET TO THE HEAD isn't the most subtle piece of filmmaking. It's all about action and suspense, and director Walter Hill knows how to make the most of the basic script. The action is brutal and life is cheap, and Stallone and Kang frequently find themselves backed into corners with no option but to fight their way out. Though their characters don't trust one another, Kang and Stallone have a great chemistry and their choleric exchanges are often surprisingly witty and sometimes truly riotous.

Acting is quite good for this type of film, with Stallone having lost none of his powerful on screen presence over the years. His hit-man is hard and dangerous, but not unsympathetic. Jason Momoa is on hand as Stallone's opposite number, a hired gun employed by the antagonists. Some of you may remember Momoa from the remake of CONAN THE BARBARIAN A couple years back. Have no fear, Momoa is a far better mercenary than he was a sword-wielding barbarian. His mercenary is big, bad, and probably crazy, but like Stallone's character lives by a personal code of honor that his more profit-minded employer cannot understand. Rounding out the quality cast is Christian Slater as a white collar criminal who isn't as much in control as he thinks he is, and Sarah Shahi brings a sort of noir-like mystery and beauty to the affair as Stallone's daughter.

BULLET TO THE HEAD is a very entertaining film. There's no shortage of explosive action along with the requisite high body count and the cast and crew lift what could have been a pedestrian exercise to a higher plane of professional achievement. This isn't a film that's going to change your life, but if you like actioners and thrillers, you won't regret taking a BULLET TO THE HEAD.",1438387200,,2639,4.668817204301075

I had ordered or DVR'd the program through the television.  The second time I watched it it just happened to be on when I turned on the television.

As with all Stallone movies, the action WILL be great.  The script, well, it's dummied down to Stallone's personal abilities.  I'm not saying that in a negative way, because everybody else speaks ""regular"".  Stallone cannot help it.  His face was toast from birth.  It's not his fault.

Bullet to the Head was a fun movie.  It was powerful in the action, had a lot of recognizable faces, and was worth the viewing.  I'd say, if you're looking for an afternoon movie, this would fit the bill.",1409961600,,790,4.485915492957746

Another sexy guy is Sung Kang and the great Adalwhali .............and these three guys make this film watchable - I seriously, and I mean seriously, think its time for Stallone to retire.",1400803200,,387,4.514285714285714
4870127,3,B005S9EJVY,"After all these years, Sylvester Stallone has proved that he is still one bad dude. Unfortunately it takes just the right circumstances to put him in a situation where he can really excel with a solid script, a strong character and a good filmmaker behind him. While Walter Hill (director of this movie) may have done some good films in his time (The Warriors, Hard Times) he is long past his prime.

In Bullet to the Head the cliche's aren't even necessarily the problem. The movie is relatively violent and mildly entertaining. I get that it was based off of a graphic novel but some of the characters around Stallone seemed a little weak. We know Sly is all into the tattoo scene now but I think the use of the parlour again (as seen in Expendables) was a little played out at this point.

If you don't have much else to watch and it's convenient to see this movie, go for it, odds are you will probably be indifferent after it's over.",1400198400,2,938,4.416184971098266
4870128,5,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the Head, with Sylvester Stallone (Blu-ray edition is copyright 2013) must
never be confused with the John Woo film by a similar name, also released
on DVD for US players (in the original Cantonese with terrible English subtitling).

To watch this film, obviously, first you have to like watching Sylvester Stallone---
at least SOMETIMES.  After all, he's the star.  As far as I'm concerned this was,
in certain ways one of his best films.

There's a twist to this action film in that Stallone plays the ostensibly bad
character--an assassin for hire.  As circumstances have it, he (reluctantly)
pairs up with an Asian-American police detective (another loose sort of
association with Woo's film) to catch some especially bad guys, who
killed his co-worker.  So at the outset there's a tension at work: for the
detective. this is about solving a crime and catching the bad guys (of which
Stallone himself is one), while for Stallone's character it's about revenge,
and perhaps about making sure he's not next on someone's list....

Sure, there's plenty of shooting, fighting, some nudity--everything you'd
ask for in an R-rated movie.  What there is also is Stallone delivering
some of his funniest-ever lines in a movie.  Remember how he
""couldn't act"" [what they say about most male action stars] ?  Well,
clearly there were some good script writers, but his delivery was also
spot-on.  For an action-suspense movie, this had me repeatedly
breaking up---all of it at Stallone's lines.  And of course there's
a satisfactorily happy ending.....",1398816000,2,1554,5.098814229249012
4870129,2,B005S9EJVY,"As a child of the 80's, I grew up on Stallone's action films. I have fond memories of seeing ""Tango & Cash"", ""Cobra"" and the ""Rambo"" movies in the theater. I was really looking forward to ""Bullet to the Head"", having Stallone face off against Jason Momoa (Khal Drogo in ""Game of Thrones"") seemed like it would be a lot of fun. Toss director Walter Hill (""The Warriors"", ""48 Hrs."") into the mix and it seems like a can't miss.

Stallone plays Jimmy Bonomo, an old hitman who is set up after he and his partner take out a corrupt cop. Jimmy's partner is killed and he's been stiffed on getting on paid for the hit. Jimmy must team up with a detective from Washington, the corrupt cop's former partner, to find out was behind the hit and to get revenge on the people who killed his partner.

The Good:
*Jason Momoa - The guy is huge and has charisma. While not properly used here, the scene that he's part of just pop.
*The Fight Scenes - Unlike most of the action movies filmed today, where we get a bunch of quick cuts, or shaky cam. Hill knows how to showcase a good fight scene, and can ratchet up the tension as it plays out.

The Bad:
Everything else.

The movie starts really strong with Stallone and his partner taking out the corrupt cop, and even carries over into the next scene where Jimmy's partner gets killed in a honky tonk. But from there the film starts to decline, and never really recovers. Stallone delivers his lines in a sleepy monotone, and he's partnered with Sung Kang (The Fast and the Furious). I'm not sure if it's Kang, or if it's the way his character is written, but he's horrible!! There is no chemistry between he and Stallone, why he's been wedged into this film is something I really wonder about? He's supposedly a straight arrow cop, yet he's allowing Stallone to carry out his mission of revenge saying things like ""I'll get you when this is over"", and in the next scene he let's Stallone kill someone else, then repeats how he'll get him the next time.

There is just no fun to this film. They try to inject humor here and there, but it falls flat every time. Jason Momoa's character finally gets to exhibit some personality at the end of the film, but by then it's too late. I'm not even sure what his character's motivation is in the movie??? The final gripe I had is that the movie is simply so dark. Most of the film is very underlit. Even the daytime shots are muted, and the finale takes place in an abandoned factory, and most of the action takes place in the shadows or in darkened rooms.

Pass this one over. If you want to see a modern take on old school action flicks, pick up Swarzenegger's ""The Last Stand"". That one had the action and the funny, just like they used to make 'em.",1398816000,,2729,4.341176470588235
4870130,3,B005S9EJVY,"Retro action-thriller finally teams Sylvester Stallone with director Walter Hill to good effect. Based on a French graphic novel, ""Bullet to the Head"" (2012) serves up 90 minutes of violent mayhem and deadpan dialogue in a B-movie ""greatest hits"" collection. Sly still packs a solid punch as a vengeful hitman in the Big Easy  one of his best late-career performances.

But then Stallone's partner himself gets iced, and Stallone, partnering with a Korean cop, is on a revenge rampage, shooting his way to the very person who killed his partner.  Good chemistry between the leads.  Rough, tough script.  And not a moment of slackness in the action.

4870197,4,B005S9EJVY,"Forget the script. It's strictly by-the-numbers. The pleasures of Bullet to the Head rest squarely on the shoulders of its leading man. Stallone is the film's center of gravity, bringing analog action and a tough guy swagger that's earned. Aside from Jackie Chan, no one has delivered more physicality to the action genre than Stallone. He doesn't cheat his audience; he literally put his body on the line to entertain us. The injuries are legendary, the images are indelible. Bullet to the Head is not in the tradition of great Stallone action films like First Blood, Nighthawks or Cliffhanger, but it's lean and efficient like some of those earlier films. The marriage of Stallone and director Walter Hill turns out to be a good one, if only they selected more worthwhile material. Still, for my money, Sly does solid character work while dispensing the vicious beatdowns, Hill maintains a brisk pace and there's just enough retro cool to keep things interesting.",1392249600,,965,5.0

Hes helmed such movies as The Driver (1978), The Warriors (1979), Southern Comfort (1981), Red Heat (1988), Last Man Standing (1996), and Undisputed (2002).  With Bullet to the Head, Hill returns to the odd couple comedy/ action film he made most famous with 48 Hours in 1982, but with mixed results.

Hill recycles the cop and convict team-up formula that pairs Stallone as aging hitman Jimmy Bobo, with Washington D.C. Detective Taylor Kwon (Kang).  In New Orleans, Bobo and his partner Louis have completed a hit on a corrupt cop who was Kwons former partner.  While celebrating at a bar, Louis is killed by another hitman named Keegan (Mamoa).  Kwon s investigation leads him to Bobo where the two form an uneasy alliance to find out who wanted the cop dead and who killed Louis.

Fairly standard fare for movies of this type and left to those ends, Bullet to the Head might have been an enjoyable homage to those 1980s action films whose fire Hill is clearly trying to rekindle.  Unfortunately his choppy direction and the muddled script of Alessandro Camon, weighs down the script with far too many bad guys and plot elements.  A corrupt businessman Robert Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), his shyster lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater), and a local mob boss named Baby Jack, not to mention Mamoas character, all leave you wondering who the heck is the real antagonist.

In 48 hours you had wonderful comic interplay between Nick Nolte, who was a strong actor, and Eddie Murphy who is a great comedian.  Bullet to the Head unfortunately has neither.  Outside of a few chuck-inducing deadpan one-liners from Stallone, the comedy bits come off far too forced.  When the two characters are not saving each others lives, they are threatening to kill each other in increasing hostile and unfunny ways.

For Mamoa, who enjoyed a short but memorable run in Game of Thrones, Bullet to the Head marks his first feature film since the disastrous Conan the Barbarian.  He seems far more comfortable in this supporting role where he doesnt have to carry the action.  And frankly, he makes a much better villain anyway.

Of course an action film has to come down to the final battle between hero and villains and you have to at least give Walter points for originality for the films climactic fight.  In The Warriors, it was a duel with baseball bats between The Warriors and the baseball uniform-wearing Furies.  Here, Bobo and Keegan square off with firemans axes in an abandoned warehouse.  And you have to give credit for Stallone as well who at 67 years of age, holds his own with Mamoa who is half his age.

Theres no doubt that some thirty years after his prime as an action film star Stallone is still a commanding presence on the screen.  But while he was teamed with a host of diverse personalities in the two Expendables films, Sung Kang simply isn't strong enough or charismatic enough to take the load off Sly.

4870204,3,B005S9EJVY,"It is a somewhat entertaining movie but I felt Sly was either trying too hard or maybe not trying hard enough. I had enjoyed a couple of his more recent flicks, The Expendables 1 & 2, and thought this might be as enjoyable but I was let down. There is nothing wrong in the quality of the movie, it's sharp and clear and my 5.1 surround sound was clear and distinct, but it's the movie itself I was disappointed in - the final scenes even reminded my of his 80's flick ""Cobra"". If you can get it on the cheap go for it, but I would hesitate in recommending this is it means paying full price of $15-$20 for it.

I'm not slamming Stallone, I've been a fan and enjoyed most of his movies from the time ""Rocky"" was first released back in the '70's or so up thru ""The Expendables"" but I don't think this was one of his better efforts.",1389139200,,829,4.117283950617284

4870216,5,B005S9EJVY,"This is an awesome mix of 80s over the top action filtered through the gritty HD lens of graphic novel to screen translation that is one of the hallmarks of recent pop cinema. Seriously, I don't talk like that but those are the right adjectives.
If you liked Kurt Russel moves, Rambo sequels and Kill Bill you will like this one. The bad guys get justice and at least one gets a little redemption. Not a movie to watch with the kids but definitely entertaining.
Oh yeah.. there are a few bullets to the head and an axe fight scene that rivals Conan. Now if someone would just go get Arnold and make Conan the King with Stallone in a cameo... hehe",1387584000,,646,4.30327868852459

4870218,5,B005S9EJVY,"Classic Stallone...maybe older, but the edge is still sharp! This movie has well tailored action scenes, but the action involved with the darkness of Stallone's character adds a lot of meat to the bone. It has all the typical one liners, gunfire, and explosions you would expect from Stallone movies, with a dark and sinister undertone that grips you from the title screen to the credits. A really quality picture, although a lot happens at night and in darkness, and the surround sound has the depth to really put you in the center of the story. So, an academy award winner? No...but definitely a movie for a Stallone fan, or an action fan. It is in my collection and surely will be viewed many times.",1387152000,,702,4.624
4870219,3,B005S9EJVY,It is what it is...a tribute to Sly and 80s action flicks.  A little more heart would have gone a long way.,1386720000,,107,3.8636363636363638
4870220,4,B005S9EJVY,"Over the years I've enjoyed watching Stallone in action, his films are rarely masterpieces but they are generally entertaining and this proved no exception. In this action thriller he plays an assassin (naturally one with a code) who is double crossed after a hit. He teams up with a cop to find who set him up, it turns into a bit of a buddy movie at that point.

The action is good and considering his age Stallone still has some good moves (I know good camera work helps, so don't burst my bubble!), it's fast paced from start to finish. The humour isn't quite as strong, there's continued sparring between the two leads which for the most part works, but occasionally falls a bit flat.

A good action film needs a suitable bad guy and Jason Momoa provides just that, he's not the head honcho, more the muscle. He has the bulk and the moves and while he has the warrior look, he doesn't quite make the bad guy in this. I can't quite put my finger on why, I think it's because it looks like he's having fun all the way through it.

Still that is forgiven for the end fight, there needs to be more battles with axes. Like the rest of the film it was great fun to watch.",1386460800,,1170,4.261261261261262

4870223,3,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the head is a movie about a New Orleans hitman who is setup and whose partner is killed(Stallone), and a Washington D.C. detective who form an alliance in order to bring down their common enemy.

The film is in many ways a throwback to the heyday of Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger in the 80's even down to the bluesy music soundtrack and gritty action sequences.  Even the teaming up of an unlikely pair bring back memories of some movies of old.

Although not a classic by any means, this movie does a good job at what it is and is unapologetic about it.  This is a movie that you don't have to think a lot about, you just relax and enjoy the action.  Stallone does the role well and is comfortable in playing that type of character.

Although the story is a bit improbable, it is still entertaining and watchable.",1385683200,2,830,4.427631578947368

4870235,4,B005S9EJVY,Like Stallone movies (all of them). This one was kind of old school and I liked it. Lots of Action,1384819200,,98,3.95
4870236,2,B005S9EJVY,"That is the only possible explanation for the failure of this film, which on the surface of things seemed quite promising, but quickly crashed and therefore mostly failed to deliver.

When I saw that Stallone was teaming up with Christian Slater and Jason Momoa to play in a film directed by Walter Hill, a legendary veteran of action cinema, I was really thrilled. The first 10 minutes of the film were actually pretty good - but then, things went south, past Louisiana and even the American continent, straight towards Antarctica.

The main culprit here is of course the scenario - or rather the lack of it (understandable - as we remember, it was eaten). Everything in this film can be anticipated, there is a complete lack of originality, dialogs are VERY lame, there is very little humour and let's not even talk about action scenes! In good action scenes the vilains (or the disposable sidekicks) make at least an effort and if possible put up a fight, offer a challenge, at least I don't know, show that they care a little about NOT dying - here, with just one exception, everybody dies immediately, the moment Stallone or Jason Momoa enter the room. That is not action, it is just boring slaughter.

The idea of pairing up a hit man and a cop on a mission of revenge was very promising, but it was comprehensively FUBAR-ed. Part of responsability lays here with Sung Kang, the guy who plays the cop. This guy CAN'T act at all and his character is a laughable obscene abomination - I can't imagine how Walter Hill could accept such a lamo p-u-s-s-y as one of the two heroes of an action film. Honestly, if you want to see a film in which a hit man and a (former) cop team up in an uneasy alliance, see ""Best seller"", a 1987 movie with James Woods and Brian Dennehy - that is one bad@ss crime/action film!

In fact, even if this film was adapted from a French graphic novel, Walter Hill tried to repeat here a little the same story as in his greatest hit, ""48 hours"" - but in this latter film he had a good scenario, two actors who could actually act and two vilains who were really scary dudes and put up a realistic big fight. In this film, not only the scenario is MIA but out of two heroes only Stallone makes an effort and the vilains are mostly laughable gun fodder. Christian Slater is completely wasted in this film (as he probably is most of the time in the real life) and the other vilain, played by British actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, is just a useless caricature, insanely stupid to the point of insulting and agravating permanently a 10-feet tall blue whale sized psychopatic killer, whom he doesn't control entirely...

That leaves Jason Momoa, who actually tries to save this film a little - but he is not really allowed to play. I am certain however that he found the scenario completely indigest (remember - he ate part of it) as he painfully smiles a lot, trying to cover a painful grin...)))

The scene of fight between Jason Momoa and Stallone characters is involuntarily funny. I really like Sly, even in his bad films, but he is now a senior citizen and the very idea of him going toe-to-toe against a colossus half his age and twice his size is pretty laughable - and in fact Jason Momoa clearly had to control himself strenuously not to puff...)))

Amongst the very few good things in this film is the completely naked prostitute Lola who appears in the beginning of the film. She is pretty hot (good breasts, great butt) and she shows herself very generously to her public, but being Polish I particularly appreciated that she is played by Weronika Rosati, the daughter of our former minister of foreign affairs. Her dad must be so proud of her...)))

I always liked Stallone, for many reasons, not the leaqt of which is that he is so much detested and mocked by cinema critics, pinko press and all the snotty Hollywood primadonnas. But honestly, this is a bad film, only for the most rabid Stallone's fans. If you want to watch him play a hit man in a reasonably good action film, re-watch ""Assassins"".",1384732800,,4038,4.544704264099037

4870238,4,B005S9EJVY,"I bought this movie more out of curiosity than any loyalty as a fan of Stallone. I liked it, both for its action and it's episodic feel of crawling through criminal under belly of New Orleans. The one thing that bugged me was the occasionally stale dialog and dated humor. Who calls an Asian guy ""Confucius"" these days and expects it to be an insult...or funny? Perhaps such banter was meant to show Stallone's character was out of touch with the times.

4870324,4,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the Head should have been better received when it was originally released. It's a good, solid movie with professional efforts by both its star, Sylvester Stallone, and its director, Walter Hill. Hill has built a career on filming great action based thrillers that involve the protagonist struggling against seemingly insurmountable odds. This one is no different. Stallone plays a professional hitman who marches to the beat of his own drummer. He's so good at assuming this role that you forget he's acting. He remains perhaps one of the most underrated actors of our time. He looks the part, too, being in fantastic physical shape. Hill's movies are essentially buddy flicks, and this time Stallone is paired with Sung Kang, who plays an NYPD detective sent to the Big Easy to run down a case. The two are uneasy partners at first, mirroring the tension Hill gave to the pairing of the cop and the convict in 48 Hours, but eventually develop a mutual respect for each other. Like all Walter Hill movies there is plenty of action which sets the stage for the climax where Stallone and the formidable bad guy go toe-to-toe in a fight to the finish. Some might call it predictable, but it's masterfully done. It harkens back to an era when movies were about characters and story instead of mindless special effects and CGI images designed to hide the thinness of the plot. Bullet to the Head is the real deal. If you like solid action thrillers with good characters this one's for you.",1380672000,,1494,4.75
4870325,4,B005S9EJVY,Exactly what I expect from a Stallone movie. I'm enjoying his resurgence as an action star...still has all the great one liners!,1380499200,,128,4.863636363636363
4870326,2,B005S9EJVY,"Stallone needs action. This flick has some, but not enough.  Stallone needs a cause, but this plot was just about a guy you didn't really like very much plodding from one situation to the next.  For a new generation flick the fights were pretty poorly choreographed.  I actually disliked most of the characters, ESPECIALLY Stallone's, and sort of wished somebody would just shoot him and get to the end. The doc who did Sly's face lift must have been drunk when he operated...  The dialog writers could not have had more than a grade school education.

And the schtick with the Bullet Whiskey?  I am a whiskey dinker, and it makes no sense, not even in a parallel universe or cartoon world.  Sure, it is based on a graphic novel, but when the lead dude's schtick is carrying around a favorite brand of whiskey that is so unpopular that nobody knows about it, is the strongest trait that he has and ends up in the title... well, you get the picture.

I would have given it one star, but I concede that I did watch it to the end, so I must not have hated it.",1380412800,,1056,4.3520408163265305
4870327,3,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the Head is pure Stallone turf here and I mean that in it's best sense.  Yes, I know: there are times when Stallone can be extremely annoying to me with some of his action films (The Expendables comes immediately to mind).  But, in the end, I actually kind of liked Bullet to the Head.  I actually like a good, mindless action film as long as it doesn't get too incredibly stupid and as long as the acting is halfway decent.  That pretty much describes Bullet to the Head for me.  Stallone does well with his role here as a nearly impervious assassin hellbent on revenge. That is as it should be in this all-too-familiar type of anti-hero type genre; the badass assassin who doesn't give a rip about anybody or anything let alone something like rules and laws and all of that kind of useless nonsense.  That's what anti-heroes are all about: being a badass.  So, having said that and understanding that, you will be treated to an hour and a half of decent, mindless entertainment where a lot of people are getting killed in sometimes interesting ways. This is just pure popcorn entertainment fare here, folks; not Citizen Kane.  This is Dirty Harry turf here; just not as good.  Still, Stallone can deliver his little short snarky lines with great comic timing with that one-of-a-kind adenoidal Stallone voice. Stallone's muscles are still there, just in a more ropey and somewhat wrinkly format these days.  Even so, would that most of us his age had even a minute portion of those ropes.

Anyway, all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised by Bullet to the Head, but not surprised surprised, if that makes any kind of sense.  I enjoyed it.  I'll probably watch it again at some point.  Which brings up an interesting point--if not dilemma--for me personally.  There are a number of films that are far, far greater than movies like Bullet to the Head; movies that I will probably never watch again.  ""Precious"" comes to mind here, as just one example of this dilemma.  ""Precious"" was a film of enormous impact on me as a film goer.  It rattled me to the bone.  It haunts me still when I think of it.  It was a masterpiece.  And yet, I never want to see it again; or, at least for a very long time.  On the other hand, I will probably wind up watching Bullet to the Head and other shallow, entertainment only movies like it a number of times.  Perhaps I am just shallow; perhaps even a little jaded or mentally challenged or something.  Whatever.  I like being entertained and action movies like this often serve that purpose better for me than many of the more ""serious"" movies like Precious.  That doesn't mean I won't see those ""more important"" and ""better"" movies; it just means that when it comes to repeated viewings, I often prefer the more ""shallow"" stuff.  So be it.

But this review is about Bullet to the Head which is probably not even deserving of all of this verbiage, so let me cut to the chase: if you like action movies involving a lot of mayhem and shootings and such, watch it.  If you prefer more refined entertainment, skip it.",1380412800,2,3064,4.530054644808743
4870328,4,B005S9EJVY,Pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Didn't want to like it but I did! Movie is predictable but lots of fun.,1380412800,,108,4.4
4870329,5,B005S9EJVY,"Not much to say, I enjoyed the movie very much. I don't really care about what critics say because everyone has their own opinion.",1380326400,,130,4.458333333333333
4870330,2,B005S9EJVY,"What do you get when you take a complete misunderstanding of the noir genre and combine it with action movie clichs and bad acting? You get ""Bullet to the Head"".

James Bonomo is a hit man for hire who has all the personality and charm of your average brick. He is played by Sylvester Stallone who yawns out his lines like he's being paid to be as dull as possible. James and his partner Hank (Holt McCallany) are sent to kill a crooked cop who is blackmailing a crooked lawyer and his crooked business partner (Christian Slater and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje respectively). That's a lot of crooked folks and there are more to come. They complete the hit, minus the cop's hooker date, and turn up to receive their fee. Unfortunately for them their bosses don't want anyone who has come in contact with the evidence to remain alive so they send psychotic mercenary Keegan (Jason Mamoa of ""Conan the Barbarian"" reboot fame) to take care of them.

So you have hitmen being hit by another hitman because the bosses don't trust the first hitmen. Why do the bosses trust the second hitman? How do they know he won't turn on them? Well, they don't. Spoiler: They should have thought this through better. But, then again clear thinking isn't really this movie's strong point.

Enter Sung Kang as Taylor Kwon, a cop from D.C. investigating the death of his ex-partner, the crooked cop. Kwon has a smartphone with which he can gather seemingly omniscient information at the drop of a hat. Is there an app for that? Where do I sign up? Kwon uses his phone rather than his brain so often that he can't see the glaringly obvious plot devices until they are holding a gun to his head. Literally. It doesn't help that Sung Kang plays the part as though he just took an Ambien. To call his performance lack luster is an insult to lack luster.

What follows from here is a dull slog through half understood noir film clichs, action movie clichs, and digital blood splatters. Someone needed to tell Stallone and company that ""noir"" doesn't mean ""slow and boring"" and that ""action"" needs a ""reason"" if we are to ""care"". Stallone's hitman seems about as torn up about his partner's death as he would over his T.V. breaking. He seems bored and unsure of what to do. This is not exactly a driving passion, but rather seems like he is thinking, ""Hey, I got nothin' better to do. Might as well avenge somethin'"". He is so disinterested in his quest that the audience has no reason to care either. The same goes for Sung Kang and his search for the killers of his partner. He says repeatedly that he just wants to arrest the ""Big Guys At The Top"" and that he didn't even like his partner, so there is no personal stake at all. Then why does he need James? Kwon provides nearly every piece of useful information with his godlike phone and he constantly whines about how James does things, so why doesn't he go it alone? Oh, right. This is a buddy cop comedy. Or is it a noir? Or an action movie? The constant narration leads us to think ""noir"", but the action is so pointlessly violent that we think ""action movie"". And the banter leads directly to ""buddy cop comedy"". So which is it? I have given up trying to figure out what their intent was and I think the director did, too.

The plot holes are too numerous to mention, such as James saying his life is perfect for a hitman because he has ""no kids, no family"" and then within 15 minutes we are introduced to his daughter. And one idiot plot point after another rolls of the screen like so much liquid waste. Does the daughter have a tragic past? Is the hero cop a genius one minute and a drooling moron the next? Will the psychotic mercenary Keegan go insane for no apparent reason and challenge James to a fight using conveniently place fire axes? If you have seen more than one badly written action film in your time you know the answer to these questions and more posed by the film. Don't forget to keep an eye out for the amazingly obvious and totally unneeded romance subplot to complete your ""crappy movie bingo"" card.

This is a movie without a brain, a cast, or a point. It is boring, nonsensical, and just plain lazily written. Even recommending it as a guilty pleasure would be to do the viewer a disservice. If you like guilty pleasure/cheesy action movies, find yourself a copy of ""Commando"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger and you will be far more entertained.

4870348,4,B005S9EJVY,"Bullet to the Head(released Nov/12)stars,among others,Sylvester Stallone as James ""Bobo"" Bonomo,Sung Kang as Det. Taylor Kwon,Sarah Shahi as Lisa Bonomo,Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Robert Nkomo Morel,Christian Slater as Marcus Baptiste and Jason Momoa as Keegan. This is definitely a testosterone fueled film romp with the Stallone-meister front and center,ripped and rarin' to go. However Stallone is no scene hog and gives his co stars plenty of time to shine.
The story is set in present day New Orleans. Stallone is a hit man for hire,with a long sordid history and past. He and his partner fulfill a contract to snuff out a man named Greely, who was blackmailing a local corrupt lawyer named Baptiste;the very man who ultimately hired Stallone. Later at a bar Stallone's partner gets snuffed by Keegan,another hit man sent by Baptiste and the man HE is in turn connected with,a former bad man from Africa,one Mr. Morel. A Korean cop from Washington,Det. Kwon,arrives to investigate Greely's murder and ends up identifying Stallone as the culprit. Kwon tracks down Stallone and asks for his help in identifying and taking down the top man,Morel.
An uneasy truce between the two sets the scene for the constant tension that throughout the picture erupts,with Kwon having to witness Stallone kill and torture his way along to find information. Kwon wants to arrest Stallone but needs him more outside than inside jail. As Stallone and Kwon make their way up the snake ladder towards their ultimate goal,Stallone's daughter,who runs a tattoo parlour in town,gets sucked into the morass unwillingly. Kwon makes a call from her establishment to the local cops,and now bad boss Morel has some leverage.
Stallone and Kwon capture Baptiste and force a confession out of him. However he gets cocky and Stallone shuts his mouth permanently. Shortly after,Keegan and some extra men arrive to shoot up the place;having traced Baptiste's cellphone. Stallone and Kwon escape and Stallone's blows his place to kingdom come. The only survivor is Keegan. Later Kwon meets with a local police detective to bring him up to speed on what he has found out. However the cop is corrupt and luckily Stallone has followed Kwon,because he is forced to kill the cop,who was about to kill Kwon. Stallone then gets a call that his daughter has been taken and he is to meet at a warehouse to get her back.
Kwon and Stallone arrive,with Stallone heading into the warehouse,while Kwon roams and susses out the area. Stallone gets his daughter back but asks that he be granted the contract to kill the cop who he has been working with. As Stallone and his daughter leave,Keegan becomes enraged at Morel for awarding the contract to Stallone. He wastes Morel and his bodyguards. He then hastens downstairs where he confronts Stallone for a battle royale with axes. As Stallone battles Keegan,Kwon is wandering the warehouse and taking targets down at will. He finally finds Stallone's daughter and both soon become witness to Keegan about to kill Stallone. Kwon shoots Keegan down,with Stallone saying that he had him. Before Stallone leaves he shoots Kwon in the chest. That,Stallone says,guarantee's him an alibi,with all the dead bodies about. Stallone leaves,but his daughter stays with Kwon.
The film ends as Kwon meets Stallone long after the fact in a bar. Kwon tells him he doesn't care what he did in the past,but if he steps out of line in the future,he will take him down. Stallone,with a grin says""That'll be the Day"",turns around and leaves.
Stallone is in great shape for this one,and especially now that he is officially a senior! He still has the moves and his demeanor is pure kick-ass. His real nemesis is Jason Momoa as Keegan, and he is also in good shape,but much younger of course. While Stallone's character's moves are street driven,Momoa's,according to his background,is much in the military vein. When the action comes,little or no punches are pulled and it gets hot pretty quick. I suppose the major drawback here is the meandering plot,which drifts from one scene to the next and drags the story along with it. The spectacular fights seemed staged to draw your attention away from the weaknesses.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette on the making of the film.
All in all,despite the weaknesses,I liked the film. Stallone is certainly the box office draw,but his screen partners also get lots of time to shine themselves. I think it an average to above average film,nicely watched on a Friday with some popcorn and the one you love beside you. 3- 3 1/2 stars.",1379030400,,4630,4.96010296010296

4870361,1,B005S9EJVY,"Let's start with the narration.  It is never a good idea for the main character to narrate an action story since the viewer recognizes that the protagonist survived to tell their tale.  All tension is gone.  The outcome is never in doubt.  Second, the touches of film-noir are lost in a brainless script.  Does style of any kind hide a weak story?  No.  So you ask - what is the plot?  A hitman reluctantly teams with a detective to hunt down his partner's killer.  Okay now, I know the story is doing the `bad guy with an honor code' thing, but how does one explain such an inept law officer?  Also, actor Sylvester Stallone does his best to create a dangerous man with a rough past, but the script does him no favors by having him cordial one minute then irritable the next.

4870395,5,B005S9EJVY,"I had no idea from the trailer Bullet To The Head wasn't going to be comedic. I was thrown into an underworld and wasn't disappointed. Sylvester Stallone is no less a superman, a seasoned tough guy that age has no effect on.  Sung Kang remained a rookie compared to Stallone's experience believing a gun to the head telling professional bad men to freeze will incite fear. In his world maybe his psychological tactics wooed the lightweights but this is gangster takeover. Based on a French graphic novel, the film noir air makes sense although noir is black and white, most of what takes place isn't in the sunshine. The hit man Stallone and the cop Kang emerge as an odd couple, their exchange and name calling role of characters from past films define the setting as the present, I couldn't help think post Hurricane Katrina, when real estate is up for grabs and the deals made are from influential men as high up as Washington DC. Christian Slater is there as a Chicago Attorney taking his piece.

I watched this a couple of weeks ago even though the reviews weren't great because Stallone is a freak of nature - steroids, plastic surgery and all. The man is 67 years old and still makes a believable action star, so I'm willing to throw a couple of dollars his way. In this instance, I definitely felt like I threw a couple of dollars away.

The plot was thin, but expected. The dialog was okay - the macho one-liners often lacked the understated humor that I expect from this genre. Stallone was still awesome and the bad guy (Jason M - did the recent Conan movie) is equally fun to watch.  The girl playing Stallone's daughter was attractive and tough. So far, so good... then they throw in the conflicted cop role and ruined the whole movie. The formula should have worked with Stallone as the ""bad"" guy with a good heart and the morally conflicted cop (the cool Asian guy from Fast & Furious) who won't survive without him, but that guy's lines and whiny delivery were nearly as grating as Renee Zellweger's voice in every movie I've ever suffered through.

Stallone then teams up with the old partner (Sung Kang) of the now-deceased dirty ex-cop to take out Slater. And if none of this makes any sense, welcome to the world of ""Bullet to the Head.""

Suffice it to say that the bodies pile up faster than vehicles at a NASCAR rally, as Stallone and Kang play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse through the streets and alleyways of New Orleans, all the while bickering like an old married couple.

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.

Bullet to the Head - we own the Blu Ray, DVD, Ultraviolet Digital Copy edition

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):

Bullet to the Head is an old-school sort of action flick.  Jimmy Bonomo aka ""Bobo"" is a not so nice guy who just happens to get himself into a lot of
boo-boos when he uncovers a deep plot involving politicians, mercenaries and worst of all, lawyers.  All he wanted to do was off this scumbag for money, and look what happens.  He ends up teamed with a cop and a beautiful young lady to try and get this whole mess taken care of.
This film was essentially a no-brainer of fun.  There was some awesome action and a good amount of explosions.  Jason Momoa (Keegan, a hired man who really takes pride in serving up death on a stick), a real up and comer of the action genre, is a perfect compliment to Sly Stallone's skill and many years of experience.  It is like the old era meets the new era and puts a bullet in it.  The partnership of Bobo and Kwon provided some humor, though I have to say I never liked the cop.  Maybe I just like the bad guys?  Who knows...

What I loved:

The story was actually a little better put together than expected.
The New Orleans style was all over the film.  It was pretty cool.
The way that it ended.  I did not expect it to end quite like that.

What I did NOT like:

I was annoyed, at best, by Kwon.  I know buddy opposites work in films but this one, I don't know, at some points it felt forced.
The marketing of this movie was non-existent.  I did not even know it had been made until I happened upon it as a new release on Amazon.

The characters were pretty darn good. I really liked Keegan, I did chuckle during the end fight, his one liners were funny. He's a good bad guy.

Look, was it Shakespeareian  acting? No. Were some parts silly and over the top? Yes. The thing is, you have to  take it for what it's worth.  It's a great popcorn movie.

4870659,4,B005S9EJVY,"I'd start this review off with a strong ""Sylvester Stallone is back,"" but it's just not true. He's very much been in the limelight recently. The 67-year old actor won't be held down by his age. After a 3-year hiatus back in 2003, he returned to the ring by acting in and directing ""Rocky Balboa."" Not content to just re-visit one of his most well-known characters, Stallone also put the headband back on for a fourth helping of ""First Blood"" in ""Rambo.""

James Bonomo (Sylvester Stallone) is a New Orleans hitman whose partner (Jon Seda) was just murdered in a double-cross. Washington D.C. detective Taylor Kwan (Sung Kang) is sent to Louisiana's capital city to investigate the death of his former colleague (Holt McCallany). Bonomo and Kwan form an unlikely alliance after they discover the two killings are somehow linked.

After the two star-filled ""Expendables"" films, Stallone obviously felt it was time to test his merit as a one-man show with ""Bullet to the Head."" Unfortunately, audiences didn't respond so well to his first solo outing as an action anti-hero. It's a real shame, because the movie is an entertaining return to the high-octane and high body count days of the 1980s and 1990s.

I'm not saying ""Bullet to the Head"" features only Stallone providing all the excitement. It's very much a buddy-cop film and co-star Kang provides plenty of thrills himself. Nonetheless, Stallone is obviously the one carrying all the star power.

We can debate all day whether he's right or wrong in his use of steroids. Let's just talk about the surface issue here. Stallone looks darn good for a guy who could be a great-grandfather. He's ripped and his upper body resembles a King Cobra about to strike. He doesn't look half-bad in a fitted three-piece suit, either.

Stallone does what he does best in ""Bullet to the Head."" He plays a tough guy with a calm demeanor who doesn't say much. Instead, he lets his fists and guns do the talking. He might have a stunt double that does all his fighting for him, but Stallone still moves effortlessly in every scene. You never stop once to ask whether Director Walter Hill yelled cut and put someone else in to fight Jason Momoa or any of the other guys his character gets into scraps with.

Director Walter Hill uses ""Bullet to the Head"" as a reminder to audiences that he once made violent action films like this for a living. He's the same guy who gave us such classic popcorn flicks as both the ""48 Hrs."" movies, ""The Warriors,"" ""Red Heat,"" and others. I'm not going to say that this is better or worse than any of those films, but it's an enjoyable way to blow 90-minutes after a hard day at work or on a Saturday afternoon.

""Bullet to the Head"" works hard to earn its R rating. Like any good action film from the 1980s, there's plenty of violence. The blood spray from gunshot wounds and actual onscreen carnage is much heavier here, though. There's also plenty of nudity and loads of bad language. Its everything one would expect from these types of movies.

The DVD version of ""Bullet to the Head"" includes a couple extra features. There's audio commentary provided by Director Walter Hill. It contains a behind-the-scenes featurette as well.

If it weren't for the cell phones and computers, ""Bullet to the Head"" could easily be mistaken for any of the great action movies of the 1980s and 1990s. The Louisiana setting is a welcome change from the typical LA or New York City locales we see in these movies. There are points where things get a bit predictable, but instead of being annoying they provide a warm feeling of nostalgia.",1375056000,,3591,4.6963434022257555

4870714,4,B005S9EJVY,"Sorry, kids, but the first thing that comes to mind in reviewing ""Bullet to the Head"" is how Stallone is aging and doing it well. My boomingness takes note of such things: skin is a bit crepy but muscles are fine-tuned, taunt, and distinct. No sag there! Since my gen is still making action movies (may I point out that Mick just turned 70?), I cannot avoid looking for and at the age factor.

That said, ""Bullet to the Head"" is valid use of two hours. The most amazing scene is the axe fight. What? Stallone with an axe? The old man simply is not old. He fights the good fight and in this case, gets a little help.

But I always get ahead of myself. Stallone plays a hit man, one world-weary, yet confident, strong, yet paired with a partner. And there presents the rub. The partner is offed during a double-cross and by a dirty, underhanded series of stabbings with a relentless blade. Being a man of loyalty, Jimmy Bobo (Stallone) must avenge his partner's death.

A new pairing results. A New York detective goes to New Orleans to investigate the death of one of their own, a dirty cop. Why did he become corrupt and for whom? The uneasy pairing was not inspiring or logical. A cop bound to the letter of the law working with a hit man? It did not work for me. Nor did the particular actor, Sung Kang. (The pairing of Kathryn Heigel and Seth Rogan worked about as well.)

After Stallone, the most effective actor is Jason Momoa as the assassin on the opposing side. Unlike Bobo, who kills for money, Momoa's characters kills for enjoyment. He's Dexter on steroids. Christian Slater plays a corrupt character with his usual breathy elegance. When the New York detective says he will make Slater talk by using psychology on him, Bobo proves the threat of torture will produce results in spades! It's a great, ironic scene!

And no one is indispensable except Bobo, the detective, and Bobo's daughter. I expected tough girl stuff from her character, but was disappointed. She's just a girly girl covered in tats. However, for the ""bad guys,"" in a dark world of corruption and deal making, one's place in the universe is never secure.

My biggest complaint (and a mild one) is that the New Orleans setting was not used to advantage. It was a prop, a city of corruption, a city just ripe ""for the taking."" Yuk!

Overall, the movie held my attention. I was entertained. Did I learn anything new? Hmmm. If one is a hit man, be prepared to eliminate your living quarters if threatened by the enemy. But I already knew that from a Jason Statham movie.",1374883200,,2546,4.509761388286334

4870718,3,B005S9EJVY,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Every once in a while a movie comes along where I have a hard time articulating how I felt about it. Well, Bullet to the Head is one of those films. It comes out swinging and doesn't let up until the final piece of narration is spoken by Stallone. It's a non-stop action film, but if fails to be anything more than that. In fact, it fails to even try. Now that I think about it, I think this is where most of my distaste stems from. It's not that I'm against some mindless action, but at least give me a story that feels different. Give me something substantial. Unfortunately, Bullet to the Head fails in both of these regards.

You follow a hitman by the name of Jimmy Bobo (Stallone). The movie starts with him and his partner Louis (Jon Seda) killing a corrupt policeman, but because of Jimmy's ""no women, no children"" code, he leaves the prostitute Lola (Weronika Rosati) alive. No surprise to the viewer, Lola goes to the police and out-of-state Washington Police Detective Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) concludes that Jimmy and Louis were the ones who killed Greely - the corrupt policeman. After Louis is killed at a bar, Jimmy makes it his duty to find his killer - Keegan (Jason Momoa) - all while hooking up with unlikely accomplice Detective Kwon. This mismatched duo soon realize that they both need each other if wish to succeed in their missions.

If I had to narrow it down, my biggest issue with Bullet to the Head is how formulaic it is. They give you a little bit of dialogue, then there's a firefight, some more dialogue, a fistfight, and then they rinse and repeat. While the movie is only 90 minutes long, this repetitiveness makes it feel much longer than it actually is. Not only that, but only a few of these action sequences feel new or doing anything inventive. Most of the time these firefights hold strong similarities to action films in the past which only bogs down the experience even more. With that said, though, the ax fight towards the end of the movie was probably one of the most memorable sequences from the entire film. It was unlike anything I've ever seen from an action flick and I enjoyed it immensely despite it feeling extremely scripted.

Another thing I noticed was that, at times, there was too much going on in the story. You see, you're not just following Jimmy and Taylor. There's also a corrupt politician from South America named Robert Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). In reality he's kind of the backbone for the entire story, but they don't explain his character well enough or give him enough screen time to make a difference. He has a few very brief scenes throughout the entire movie which makes it difficult to keep up with - or care about - what's going on in his side-story. Which ultimately leads into my final complaint.

I found that the lack of character progression became frustratingly annoying as the movie progressed. Not only that, but it seemed as if we were given little-to-no information on a great deal of the supporting cast. I would have loved to find out more about Keegan, but they didn't touch on his character's back-story at all. I guess we're supposed to assume that he's just another hitman, but part of me felt like there could have been much more to the character than that. Now part of this stems from seeing his reactions to certain things, but I also found myself curious as to why he was so angry and ruthless. Finally, I couldn't fight the feeling that no one really changed by the end of it all. Jimmy was still Jimmy and Taylor was still Taylor. Life went on and I doubt anyone made any changes in their life when it was all said and done.

Finally, the casting and the film's score, composed by Steve Mazzaro, were both alright. While neither of them blew my mind, they got the job done and I guess that's all I could ask for. Stallone and Kang were probably the best out of the entire cast and I found myself surprised at how well they worked together on-screen. Aside from them, Mamoa was the only other standout, though. While his character didn't have a lot of dialogue, he seemed like the perfect fit for the stoic and ruthless Keegan. The score, on the other hand, was kind of hit and miss throughout the entire film. Some pieces worked really well while others could have been better. Not the best score I've heard all year, but I've definitely heard worse.

Overall Score: 6.5/10 - When you really break it down, the biggest problem with Bullet to the Head is that it fails to do anything new. It draws inspiration from action films of old, but it doesn't do anything to differentiate itself from previous works. Not only that, but it's coupled with a sub-par cast, a mediocre score, and some poor character progression. While I don't regret taking the hour and a half to sit down and watch it, it's not something I can see myself watching again. If you had your eye on this when it was in theaters I would consider making it a rental.",1374796800,,4984,4.537263626251391

4870721,4,B005S9EJVY,"If you are a fan of 80's Action, particularly of Tango & Cash, a Stallone/Kurt Russell film that this movie reminded me of, then you'll like this movie. There were no slow parts,  crap blowed up real good, the head badguys were evil, rich, egotistical and slimy and their henchmen, straight from Goons-R-Us, died, like flies.

Violently. There was a lot of the good old ultraviolence in this movie, and it was cartoonish enough to be just fun and lighthearted, and not induce you to feel queasy or guilty.

Stallone, a hitman with some moral standards quipped his way through the movie, eyeing up the stiffs as they said their piece before he blew them to pieces. I would have given the film five stars, but the female character was far too helpless, and Stallone's Fish-Out-of-Water Asian cop buddy/sidekick was a very weak and annoying character.

I would have given the film three stars for Stallone's character and performance, the 4th star is for Jason Momoa. His character was well-written, but his performance was excellent, especially in the final scenes of the movie, where he proved that even psychopathic mercenaries have a flashpoint of moral outrage.

Yes, the plot was thin, and a little confusing, and other than Stallone and Momoa, the rest of the major characters were annoying ciphers. However, Stallone and Momoa were enough to carry the film. What can I say? It's an 80's Action Flick. If you'd rather see Hugh Jackman weep and sing Broadway ditties than skewer badguys, this isn't the movie for you. But, if you like action, in general, and 80's Action in particular, you'll enjoy this film.",1374710400,,1612,4.847272727272728

The story here is very simple:  Sylvester Stallone plays a hit man who goes about his business with the precision of a seasoned surgeon.  He dissects what needs to be dissected and he does not rethink what grief or misery he may have caused.  He know that his age and the business he is in do not account for any remorse.  In the opening scene, he and his partner take down a bad guy and this ""hit"" does not go unnoticed.  His partner soon meets a very violent end, and Sylvester Stallone is now out for revenge.  He meets an Asian detective (who has also lost a partner) and thus a very tentative liaison begins.  This may have been the biggest problem for the movie--there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stallone and his co-star.  However, there is non-stop action and the viewer will soon see why the film was named ""Bullet to the Head.""

This film does not claim to be a cinematic masterpiece.  It is simple on all levels, which I certainly enjoyed for a change.  I see movies to be entertained.

4870857,3,B005S9EJVY,"Well, this movie is nothing special.  The acting is great, but the story is boring.  And it is insultingly basic.  For example, Slater's character gives an ENORMOUS info dump during an interrogation--info no criminal would give so freely, in so many sentences, and with so much clarification and explanation.  It is laughable!  Worse, he gives up all this crucial info. after Stallone hits him . . . ONCE!!!!  LOL.  Ridiculous.

Then the writers try to make a big deal out of the old assassin's lack of reliance on technology, like cell phones.  The cop gets info from it.  Wow!  Big deal.  He gets info by USING it to contact other cops!!!!  No assassin is going to have access to databases unless they are hacked.  Yet, the story drops it and it goes nowhere.  The assassin does not gradually ease into its use and then suddenly use it at a key moment in the plot.  Nothing unique develops.

When the movie turns violent, the action is satisfying.  But . . . there is not enough action.  When the cop actually gets to fight, it is way too late in the movie to care.  Yet he has skills!  In my opinion, these two guys should have been put up aginst an army of bad guys.  Instead the movie limps between action scenes.  Just enough action to keep you watching.

I will say, though, that Momoa STEALS the movie at least as much as Stallone.  I never expected much from him--I was WRONG!  He is an excellent actor as well as an excellent villainous action star.  Every time he arrived on camera, you feared what was going to go down.  Nice!  His action scenes with Stallone are the best in the movie--by far!

The relationship between the cop and the assassin is not developed.  In fact, if Stallone's character had simply killed the cop and forged ahead, the movie would not suffer.  Another annoying part of this film is the spontaneous relationship between the tattoo artist and the cop.  Why?  For what?  It has no purpose.

In fact, the weakest aspect of this movie is the characterization.  It's frustrating to see excellent actors given cardboard cut-out parts.  As a viewer, you relate to the actor more than the character because the movie gives you basically nothing to admire, despise, contemplate, about them as people.  Such a common Hollywood writing failure.  The movie and the actors deserved more.  Add thirty minutes, for the gods' sakes!!!

And even when he plays a character with a seedy and violent history, he's still a hero! He's tough and merciless on the bad guys, but he still has a soft spot in his heart for his movie daughter, so don't mess with her or you will incur his wrath! As a hitman in this movie he plays his role well, and there is plenty of action with bullets flying in all directions numerous times. Another aspect of the plot involves his teaming up with a DC detective---both of them want to find the bad guys who killed their respective partners. As is predictable they ride in the same car so they spend a lot of time arguing about procedures and about their plans to catch those who double-crossed them. All the bad guys look real menacing---great acting by all.  Sarah Stahl does only an ok job in her character as Stallone's daughter.

4870891,3,B005S9EJVY,"Walter Hill directs a Sylvester Stallone film. I was a little surprised to know they had never worked together before, but anyway I thought ""Bullet To The Head"" would be a great opportunity for their belated collaboration. About 20 minutes in, however, I began to feel something was not quite right with the result. Sylvester Stallone looks great as a contract killer with his own set of ethics. Sung Kang as a strait-laced Washington D.C detective is not bad.

Perhaps it is the weak storyline that is to be blamed. Here is a time-tested ""48 Hrs."" buddy movie formula, but Walter Hill fails to make full use of the premise of the mismatched duo. Sung Kang's detective takes out his BlackBerry and locates their next ""target."" Old school killer Stallone is not impressed. A few amusing one-liners. The two arrive at the destination, do what they do, and go on to the next place. There is not much chemistry between them, no real surprise about what they can do, or cannot.

When a beautiful tattoo artist Lisa (Sarah Shahi) steps in, I thought finally the film was going to do something different. I was wrong as she was just another plot device.  Walter Hill never gives a chance to be interesting to the supporting players including Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jason Momoa and Christian Slater. I don't know anything about the French graphic novel by Alexis Nolent upon which the film is based. I don't know why the filmmakers were attracted to the source material, either.

To be fair, the action scenes are decent and Stallone's performance is compelling. With its extended climactic fight sequence ""Bullet To The Head"" feels like 1980s-style action flick, for better or for worse.",1370044800,5,1683,4.853658536585366

Even the main antagonist played by Jason Momoa who's better suited for a more heroic role, is reduced to a silly, cartoon assassin. ""Bullet to the Head"" is as appropriate a title as something this bad should get seeing as the 'action' film genre hasn't evolved all that much since the 80's. If you have no desire to stimulate your brain cells whatsoever for like 90 minutes or so, then give this a go.

It adds up to the 80's feel that the movie has. Walter Hill did a good job directing.
Bottom line is, Bullet to the Head does not disappoint. Certain actors have come and go. But legends like Sylvester Stallone have proved over and over that they can continue to be on top of their game even after being in the movie business for FIVE DECADES.

But Bullet To The Head is a perfectly functional and solid shoot 'em up, beat 'em down movie that covers all the bases, by the numbers. Dirty cops, bent lawyers, boobs and explosions aplenty.

Stallone does his uncompromising honor thing. Khal Drogo is this season's Ivan Drago. And everybody else does exactly what you'd expect and nothing more. Don't forget the popcorn.",1369440000,2,539,4.988888888888889

4870897,3,B005S9EJVY,"Not bad at all. Better than I was expecting.

Staged with a functional, but predictable, screenplay - Sly portrays James Bonomo, contract killer. His base of operations - The Big Easy. A throwback film complete with noir-ish voice over narration and the seedy revelations of an ugly underbelly which polite society gracefully ignores. Jimmy and his partner in crime have just competed another successful job. But their upcoming payoff isn't what they were expecting. Instead, the assassins are themselves targeted for assassination.

Beaten, bruised, but alive - he escapes his own contract. Unfortunately, his partner wasn't as fortunate. And now Jimmy's sincerely pissed. He's going to focus all his energies to find out why and to whom he will deliver retribution plus interest.

And in a night where partners are lost, enter Detective Taylor Kwon. Turns out that the target of the original hit was his old ridealong, a disgraced officer recently fired for a multitude of professional and personal failings. As Kwon tracks down the murderers of his former partner, he realizes that the two deaths are connected. Now he wants a sit-down with Jimmy.

Dialogue, characters, and plot were straight out of the Walter Hill catalog - comedic one liners and reasonably clever quips woven into a crime drama with two very mismatched partners. Not that that's a bad thing; nor is it particularly dated, since many modern filmmakers still trace this outline for their productions. But what this film lacked was a crisper script, one more attuned to the edgier and quicker pace of action flicks of today. Instead, 'Bullet' felt stodgy and sluggish in places, a bit too throwback.

However, the grand final of ""old school vs new school"" was wickedly fun. A pulse-pounding battle with bumboocha badass, Jason Momoa, as a private contractor who doesn't give a bleep about money. He delivered the goods despite his character having been mismanaged in the screenplay. A creative loss that could've and should've produced a stronger, more satisfying finish. The ""viking"" fight almost making up for 'Bullet's' other shortcomings.

Almost.

Overall, being amazed at Stallone's trademark cannons and physical conditioning was nearly worth the price of admission. So let's give credit where credit is due. It must take a helluva lot of work to look that ripped at an age where most of his chronological peers are settling down for retirement, early bird dinners, and a widening caboose. The man looked absolutely fantastic, easily passing for a decade younger than his birthdate.

Loved that the co-star in 'Bullet' is asian. Believe it: I'm no mob-inspired, politically-correct, neo brown-shirt drone. In fact, I detest the mindless Huxleyian world sheeple have built for themselves in modern America. But just the fact that a non-caucasian was in a role that didn't involve martial arts or an organized crime family is damn near enough to call this movie a solid success.

However, that incidental accolade aside, this flick was reasonably decent enough to pass an evening.

Personal Notes:

- If you're somehow able to get stunning and ridiculously delicious Sarah Shahi to do a nude scene, you maximize that to the absolute flipping max. What you don't do is wastefully execute the throwaway trope of walking-out-of-the-tub-and-briefly-dropping-the-towel bit. A sad and tragic loss.

- Longtime director Walter Hill can still do some amazing work.

4870898,3,B005S9EJVY,"No, it's not 1990 any longer, but don't tell Sylvester Stallone that. His latest retread of glory's past, it seriously looks like a  movie that he has already made. The fact that it is directed by the legendary Walter Hill, one of my personal favorite filmmakers makes this all the more depressing. Like Sly, Hill is doing a retread of film's past, in his case 48HRS. or Red Heat, and looking seriously old and out of touch by doing so

It all begins exciting enough with a bullet shooting it`s way through the Warner Bros. and Dark Castle logos. Alas, this is where the inspired filmmaking abruptly ends and the generic script begins.

Stallone stars as Jimmy Bobo, a black suit clad hitman. Who with his partner Louis (Jon Seda) are double crossed by their employers. Louis is killed and Bobo vows revenge. A D.C. Korean-American cop named Taylor Kwan (Sung Kang) is looking for the same guys as Stallone, so the two form a problematic partnership.

Stallone is still a good action star, and assumes this anti-hero noir hero role well. Kang is an amiable screen presence, best known for his work as Han in three of the Fast and the Furious movies. But together they have no chemistry, they are simply mismatched and not just in the film sense.

Playing Bullet to the Head's chief heavy is Jason Momoa. Obviously cast because somebody was under the misguided belief that Conan the Barbarian was gonna make him a superstar. But he is no star, he is a terrible actor who looks like he may be able to grunt his lines. He has no charisma to speak of either. He isn't menacing, just kind of stupid looking. And he really does make Stallone look like Brando by comparison.

In all fairness, there are a few inspired moments though like when we get to see Sly's mug shots through the ages, we get to watch him age in front of our eyes, going from Death Race 200-era to possibly the Expendables 2. We also have a nice bluesy soundtrack score by Steve Mazzaro. Bullet to the Head also looks great, the visual style is awesome, the only thing to let us know that Hill wasn't asleep in his director's chair. The scenes of Louisiana after dark are great too, filled with beautiful nourish style.

Bullet to the Head is a movie with a lot of good things about it, but it is by no means a good movie. It is more a sad stroll down memory lane than a new chapter in anyone's film legacy. Stallone and Hill can pretend no time has passed since they were stars, but they are fooling no one, least of all  anyone who cares, meaning there fans.

Bullet to the Head is loaded with extreme violence and plentiful female nudity.  But still manages to be boring. It's just so darn familiar and incredibly routine, it's also slow moving and dull to boot. The whole moving seems to be on autopilot with one terrible worn out clich followed by another. We the audience know where this movie is headed every step of the way with few if any surprises coming along the way.

It all plays out like a movie that is decades out of date. And even it were not so, it would not have been one of Stallone's or Hill's best by a long stretch.

The screenplay is by Alessandro Camon and it is based on a graphic novel titled ""Du Plomb dans la tete"" which is by Alexis Nolent, if the novel is anything like the screenplay it is uninspired and filled to capacity with clichs. Stallone as a hitman who doesn't work with cops and gives us a whole speech about how he kills  ""no woman, no children"". Sly's sense of humor is anything but, at least in this movie. There is a lot of dumb dialogue, lame jokes about ""old school"" antics and a string of truly lousy unfunny ethnic jokes.

There are a lot of scenes with Stallone and Kang pointing there guns at each other. And poor Sly is saddled with the stupidest name of any of his characters before. Combined with a plot point that seems significant, the meaning of the tattoo shared by both his daughter and the Russian hooker, but is never revealed, serves as nothing more than a time waster.  Bullet to the Head is actually a notch or two below a lot of direct-to-DVD movies that have starred Van Damme, Lundgren, Snipes, Berenger, Seagal and the like.

It has been well publicized that this was not a happy production. The original director was Wayne Kramer (the Cooler, Running Scared), who apparently clashed with Stallone and was quickly replaced. Then the film's original co-lead, Thomas Jane, was abruptly let go by the producers. Hill didn't finish the movie. Producer Joel Silver just ended his long partnership with the WB after decades of calling them home, and leaving behind such lucrative franchises as Lethal Weapon, the Matrix and the Robert Downey, Jr. Sherlock Holmes movies. Add to that the fact that Bullet to the Head has been gathering dust sitting on a shelf for almost a year, it even still carries a 2012 copyright.

Hill is a director who I have always admired. Bullet to the Head marks his first theatrical work in over a decade. Until now he had made very few bad movies, but Bullet to the Head joins the ranks of Brewster's Millions and Another 48 HRS. as the only films from the maestro that I have to give a flunking grade too. Coming just weeks after Arnold Schwarzenegger's big screen flop the Last Stand, I am starting to sense a trend here, one that makes these old timers truly once and for all expendable.

4870899,5,B005S9EJVY,"James Bonomo (Sylvester Stallone) is a hitman. Due to a number of circumstances he teams up with Taylor Kwan, an honest cop (Sung Kang) who wants to take people in while Bonomo wants to take them out.

The screenplay for this film is based on a novel which means the writing is a step above the hack made-for-film scripts we've been subjected to by the other heavy weight action film stars...especially the guy with the pony tail. The title ""Bullet to the Head"" has a duo meaning as Stallone enjoys Bullet bourbon. In the beginning Stallone swerves to miss a cat. This is an omen to the next scene where he spares a woman with a panther tattoo on her back. These subtleties (pay attention writer/actor/cop Steve) along with Louisiana harmonica blues grindhouse music and a superior script overcomes bad acting, including Christian Slater.

The film is filled with action and bullets to the head. It was just enough drama filler to make a story so we don't get bored when we see people get shot. Worth a view for those who like action films just a cut above the grindhouse style.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Nudity (Weronika Rosati, Sarah Shahi-briefly, plus extras. No sex.",1362182400,6,1171,4.730392156862745
4870900,5,B005S9EJVY,"A completely retro movie. I flashed back throughout this flick to some of the best years of my life as I thought about films like Dolph Lundgren's ""Showdown in Little Tokyo,"" ""Red Heat,"" and even ""They Live.""

What you have here is Stallone in his ""Cobra"" mode, a true bad ass, take no prisoners type of hero. He plays Jimmy Bobo, and he's hellbent on revenge after his partner is knifed by the dude from ""Game of Thrones."" I'm glad Jason Momoa is in this film because for the first time in my life, my girl dragged me to see a Stallone flick!

Enter in Detective Taylor Kwan, an upright law enforcement-type dude, who uses his investigative powers to discover Jimmy Bobo is an active hitman, and he and his partner killed a powerhouse in the criminal underworld. In fact, Kwan is certain Bobo's partner died as a result of the hit, and tries to lure Bobo into working for him to find a ruthless criminal.

The two eventually form an uneasy alliance and the movie is slam packed full of fist action and bullets and man, there is even an axe fight. Complete with a Christian Slater cameo as slimy Marcus Baptiste, why not see this film?

It's totally 80,s, early-90's style and it's banging, man. Nice nudity as well.",1360713600,54,1216,4.48868778280543
