6780677,5,B00P0634QG,"It makes me sick that the Discovery Channel canceled this show. Many of the shows they air now are not worth watching. Out of all the survival shows out there (and there are a lot), this show and Survivorman with Les Stroud are the best, bar none!",1453161600,3,247,4.276595744680851

8685974,3,B00P0634QG,"Not quite as clean as season 1.  Many four letter words and some sexual innuendo.  Ruth is trying to portray a sexier role. (I liked down-to-earth, non pretentious Ruth better)  I did not appreciate this.  She conveniently lets her shirt come down on off her shoulder and ties her bra to the top of a make shift shelter.  Ruth is also a little bit crabbier in this season.",1488326400,,372,4.411764705882353
