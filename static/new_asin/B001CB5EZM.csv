8286374,5,B001CB5EZM,"I was a pretty serious exerciser when I got pregnant and did a lot of Cathe Friedrich and Cristy Taylor DVD's.  I got several postnatal workouts when I was done with the pregnancy and most of them did not feel like a ""real"" workout to me.  I do suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leisa-Hart-s-FitMama-Postnatal-Workout-ma-FitMama-Me/dp/B00009W0VL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leisa Hart's FitMama: Postnatal Workout /ma FitMama & Me</a>&nbsp;for the first few weeks postpartum as a way to ease back into fitness especially if you are not in great shape or were put on bedrest like I was.  After that, this DVD is awesome!  It does have a lower intensity workout for those who aren't ready to tackle the whole workout.  I got this 8 weeks postpartum and was ready to dive right in so I didn't use the shorter workout and can't really critique it.

First off, you do need to beware that this is an 80 minute workout so you need to set aside that time.  You do deserve that time though and hopefully can find a way to do this once or twice a week.  I love the attitude of the teacher in that she is not at all annoying, but does push you and encourage you when you need it.  The music is lowkey and just in the background.  I do wish it was a little more inspirational.  The set is just a white set, but that didn't bother me.

This is a very tough, but acheivable workout.  You will feel it the next day and the day after that.  This is not just a workout for postnatal women either.  Aside from the few kegels you do (which all women should do anyway), you wouldn't even know it was a postnatal workout.  (She does give great advice in an informational segment for postnatal women though).  This is a DVD you should purchase if you want to tone your entire body and feel like you worked out with a personal trainer.  She does not miss any muscle group.  It also has some cardio to keep your heartrate up throughout.  Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to everyone wanting to get into shape regardless of whether or not you just had a baby.  Fight through it and you will make it through.  I love it!",1277510400,2,2152,4.62269129287599
8286375,5,B001CB5EZM,"This workout will not waste your time.  I have only just begun using it, but I can tell it is going to yield the results I am looking for.  It is challenging and yet flexible at the same time.  The different workout options allow me to do some level of exercise daily.  Teddi combines moves so that you're working more than one part of your body at a time (holding in your abs, working on balance, etc.), which makes the most of your precious time.  Repeating the moves throughout the circuit at different speeds or intensity challenges your muscles in new ways.  She focuses on areas of your body that have been stressed (and stretched) by pregnancy, while also working on muscles that get taxed from picking up children, holding them, changing diapers, etc.  That being said, it would be a great workout for any woman at any stage in her life (even if you've never been pregnant).  I highly recommend this DVD.",1265587200,,912,4.552147239263804
8286376,5,B001CB5EZM,"I have never been stronger, leaner, and in better shape since doing this amazing workout. Teddi knows what women's bodies responds to and her formula REALLY WORKS!",1226448000,2,163,5.074074074074074
8286377,5,B001CB5EZM,"I HIGHLY recommend this exercise DVD.  I am the mother to 3 children, the youngest of which is 4 months old and I am in the best shape of my life thanks to Teddi.  This DVD takes all of the elements of her studio work out and brings it to  your living room.  There is nothing better than being able to work out in your own home in an effective way.  I have even done the DVD with my baby in her bouncy seat - love that!  She targets all of your problem areas (hips, butt, thighs, abs) and gives you a cardio work out too.  I cannot say enough great things about Teddi and Hot Mamas - get this DVD!!!",1226275200,7,599,3.9008264462809916
8286378,5,B001CB5EZM,"You can get your pre-pregnancy body back and this will help. I've been training with Teddi every week for over two years now and this DVD is as effective as having Teddi training you in your own home. All women, no matter what stage in life can benefit from this DVD.",1224547200,3,267,4.254901960784314
8286379,5,B001CB5EZM,"Seriously, 3 years post-natal and I'm stronger, leaner and have more confidence. Since I'm moving I can't train with Teddi in person anymore so I'm SO glad she did these DVDs. And there's nothing cheesy on here, which of course, I can't stand. Just a good workout that's challenging and rewarding.",1219795200,3,297,4.8431372549019605
