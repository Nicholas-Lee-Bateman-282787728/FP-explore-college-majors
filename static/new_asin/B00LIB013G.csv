8666097,5,B00LIB013G,a touching story about a man and inner city kids.  it truly does portray the importance of organization and critical thinking to the development of a kid's self-esteem and development.  The movie is very well done with hints of humor (the foot rash) and emotion (losing the debates).  I felt inspired when I left the theater and purchased several copies that I provided to colleagues at work with young kids.  It also tells the story of a man who wants to make a difference to others which he accomplishes both to his students and the luck ones who get to view it.,1408838400,,564,4.5
8666098,5,B00LIB013G,"A well-documented and compelling film worth seeing, discussing and sharing.  In an era when so much bad news circulates around our schools, it's refreshing to know that people, and film art such as Crotty's Kids, can still provide hope.",1408406400,,236,5.051282051282051

High school speech and debate is so seldom taught (especially in inner city schools); I applaud the effort shown here.",1408233600,,263,4.739130434782608

8666102,5,B00LIB013G,"I loved it.

Whacky, interesting and truly inspiring.

This is a story of a man out to do some good for some underprivileged kids...but in the most unorthodox way imaginable!

Enter the fascinating world of debate with the weird and wonderful Crotty, the big-hearted, foul mouthed, best teacher ever.

Why?

Because he cares.

5 stars.",1407801600,2,335,5.0
8666103,5,B00LIB013G,"Crotty's Kids takes us on an emotional journey through the lives of five high school men in the South Bronx.
The film is a must-see for any documentary enthusiast, especially avid debaters and debate fans.  It raises key issues concerning education reform within the inner city, and the essential, but often vacant role of the father figure. Above all,  Crotty demonstrates that one person can make a difference in shaping a child's future. His energy transcends the span of the film and will motivate you to make a change.

Crotty's Kids is a raw social documentary with a positive message sure to captivate audiences.",1407801600,,619,4.9326923076923075
8666104,5,B00LIB013G,"Well, James Marshall Crotty, I just finished viewing this fine and powerful film: ""Crotty's Kids."" I participated in debate myself as a freshman in high school, and then three more years of high school forensics/speech, so I am familiar with the world of competitive debate/public speaking that this documentary features. It does my heart good to see this world finally get some screen time. Too few adults understand the challenge and complexity of these activities. As the film implies, debaters and speakers are truly intellectual athletes, as dedicated and talented as anyone on a baseball diamond or football field, but when they win state, there is no television coverage or column inches in the newspaper, so this film grants them some well-deserved lime-light. One day, I hope to see a similar documentary on competitive public speaking. Incidentally, this was the first time I heard Crotty's voice.

But in a sense, the film is not about debate ultimately at all, but rather about the young men who Crotty teaches about debate and by extension, about life. The feature shows Ryan Moore, Christian Vargas, Jordan Lewis, Hector Rivera, and Carlos Quiroz. All these young men face the panoply of challenges of life of poor people, but debate becomes a way for them to transcend their troubled, gang-infested neighborhoods and realize their dreams. I sympathize with Crotty's challenges as he works his way through the debate season with these young men: It turns out the teenagers boys are are difficult to deal with, and as their numbers increase, the difficulty does too. An odd incident with a coat notwithstanding, these fine young men grow and develop across time. Any high school teacher will recognize the rainbow of experiences one has with a group of teenagers: the joy and the frustrations and the realizations of one's own limitations. The boys are a joy to behold, too. One young boy's flawless imitation of a Bronx Science girl who wins a debate tournament is worth the price of the ticket (or DVD) alone.

One also gains insight to the challenges of Crotty's life - apparently a bachelor with no children, and a rebel from his conservative, traditional upbringing in Nebraska and as a graduate of a Jesuit high school, he has apparently hit the road in an RV in the past and explores the Buddhist faith (He also struggles endlessly with a foot/skin problem of some type, into which I might gain more insight from the director's commentary.)

Yet upon the death of his mother, he returns the core values instilled by his parents and his Jesuit education: To be a man for others, especially being a man for these young men. As the title cards at the highlight the young men's educational and life successes, the meaning of that motto become all the more clear and yes, beautiful.",1406332800,2,2797,4.909090909090909
