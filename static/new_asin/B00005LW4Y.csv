7944391,5,B00005LW4Y,"Well written and performed story, inspirational with a nice twist at the end - and , as always, Robert Carlyle can do no wrong! He is THE PERFECT ACTOR! Once you start to look for movies and shows he has been in, you'll realize you already have seen a number of his performances . He becomes the portrayed character so well, he disappears into the role. You won't soon forget the characters he creates: Rumplestiltskin in ""Once upon a time"", Gaz in"" The Full Monty"", Begbie in ""Trainspotting"", Hilter in ""the Rise of Evil"", Durza in ""Eragon"". He played the main role of Don in ""28 Weeks Later""- a sequel that proved to be much better than the first movie ""28 Days Later"". He has a large number of lesser known, independent films that are quite poignant. Take the time to check him out, you WILL be glad you did!",1465516800,,811,4.413333333333333

7944395,4,B00005LW4Y,"Jimmy Grimble (played by Lewis McKenzie) is a little guy who wants to play on the soccer team of Greenock High School, in the Manchester, England.  The team is being contingently sponsored by the father of the team's star, 'Gorgeous' Gordon Burley (played by Bobby Power).  Gordon and his pals constantly bully Jimmy.  On one occasion, Jimmy hides out with a homeless woman (played by Jane Laptaire), who gives him an old 'magic' pair of soccer shoes.  Unimpressed, Jimmy tosses them away.  The next day, Gordon throws Jimmy's regular shoes into a garbage truck.  Desperate, Jimmy retrieves the 'magic' shoes and becomes the team's leading scorer.  The team wins, making it to the high school finals.  A scout for Manchester United will be watching.  Then Gordon throws the 'magic' shoes into a canal.  What is Jimmy to do?

Jimmy comes from a fatherless home.  Mom's dates are married or biker trash.  His coach is depressed over an nasty incident in his own career and takes little interest.  Jimmy is a Manchester City fan, not a United one. Piece by piece, it all comes together for Jimmy, his mother, and his team.  He works hard, seeks advice, and builds relationships.  He even graciously helps Gordon score the winning goal.

The acting is very fine, with both Jimmy and the supporting characters doing excellent work.  The filming was all on location in the Manchester area.

The movie is suitable for most kids.  There are bullying scenes and suggestions of mom's sex life.  For skin, there is only a locker room scene, where Gordon seems to be looking around too intently too much.

The primary stumbling block for American audiences is that the dialogue is conducted in the Manchester dialect.  It may take a while to get used to it.  Watching it a second time might be useful. There are no captions or subtitles.

This is a nicely done, uplifting success story.",1186790400,2,1874,4.799373040752351
7944396,5,B00005LW4Y,"A film about football is quite commonplace. A film about young boys who want to become VIPs in life is also quite banal. But a young boy who wants to become a star in Manchester United is as brilliant as a blue sky and as pure as white snow, and there can only be one out of a great number of candidates. Jimmy Grimble had everything against him. His unmarried mother with short-term manfriends was not a comfortable family situation.

He was the victim of the bullies at his comprehensive school and one of the bullies was the son of the rich tycoon who was going to invest a lot of money to build a new gym for the school. The girl he likes, more or less, at least he would like to make friends with, is a pugilist and she does not like football. The only manfriend of her mother's who likes him and he likes has to get unattached and detached from another liaison before being what he wants to be, the father of this boy as well as the husband of this mother of his.

And yet his success will come from a strange spiritual and virtual construction he will build in his own mind about a pair of shoes an old homeless woman gave him one day when he was being chased by the bullies. The shoes of a mythical football player. Jimmy Grimble decided in his head that he is only winning, and brilliantly at that, because of the shoes. And what will happen if the shoes are thrown away by one of the bullies? That's the film, the magic of the film, the magic of football too. And a lesson is given to us at the same time.

Jimmy scores three times in the final match of the school cup, the first time by himself, and the other two times by using the bully who likes him so much (Ah! Ah!), once with a pass that leads the bully to score through a wide easy opening, and the other time by using the bully's head as a rebounding wall to score without him doing anything except getting stunned by the ball. Teamwork is fundamental in football because it confuses the opponents, provided it is creative. I guess the bully did not like it after all.

7944397,4,B00005LW4Y,"I love this movie, yeah it was predictable but it was funny, entertaining, and heart-felt. The main character is a loser but lovable, his mom a typical single working parent, his coach a washed up has been, his father figure married to another woman but loveable nontheless, but my favourite character would have to be the boyfriend with his ""Kung Fu"". You may have to watch this movie 2 or 3 times to understand what they are saying but all in all its a good movie. If you liked Billy Elliott then you'll love this movie. Also if you are a Man. City fan of course you'll love Jimmy Grimble. Also there is a sample of the movie in Matthew Good's avalanche",1066608000,,655,4.377049180327869
