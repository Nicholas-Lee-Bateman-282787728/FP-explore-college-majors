I wasn't sure what I was renting at the time, but after I watched it... I fell in love with the characters and the story.  And I could not believe the male love interest of Crystal was the same hunk ""Hank"" from Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman.  Wow..  has he changed and he looks HOT!!!  Girls.... if you loved him on the show... check him out now.",1193011200,13,484,4.252747252747253
2891772,5,B000T28C86,"I watched this movie twice. Once by myself and once with my boyfriend who prefers action.  He liked it too and was glad I found it.  The storyline is meaningful for anyone going through life changes. The chararacters are very unique and interesting. I found the movie and the music more entertaining than I expected.  My boyfriend and I both cried during some of the stories told as testimonials. Very moving and lighthearted about what a communinty is capable of overcoming when they pull together. Brian Dennehy and Crystal Benard had some great lines that made you laugh. I could watch it again to remind myself of simple ""acts of kindness.""",1192924800,19,644,4.783783783783784

2891937,5,B000T28C86,I bought Welcome to Paradise from Amazon.com.  It is a heartwarming story of a widow with a teenage son who moves to a small town to be the minister of a small congregation.  The characters are interesting and fun and the movie has some great moral lessons without preaching at you.  This minister reaches out to the homeless community in their town which gives an example to her new congregation.  I really loved this movie!,1319932800,,425,4.626666666666667

I have to say that EVERY CHARACTER in this story had the unique qualities of profound acting, tenderness of character, and the ability to capture the heart of the viewer.  You cannot watch this story unfold without being caught up in the drama, the truth, and the compassion of one woman preacher....who really had a heart for God and for all people!",1300752000,,461,4.3882352941176475
2891941,5,B000T28C86,"I actually watched this movie with my 85 year old father, which in itself is an accomplishment these days.  None of the usual obscenities that you usually have to worry about.

This movie is good to share with fellow believers.  I found this to be uplifting.,1271635200,,252,4.456521739130435

2891952,5,B000T28C86,"I first remember Crystal Bernard in a TV series called ""The Master"" with Lee Van Clief, and have enjoyed her acting since. She does not dissapoint in ""Welcome To Paradise."" This movie presents an easy to follow story line that is enjoyable, complete with a couple of ""bad"" guys (her former boss and her current associate pastor, people that tug at your heartstrings (the homeless people), and the hero (Bernard). They struggle through tragedy with the destruction of their church, suspense as they are faced with loosing their church charter, and a wonderful ending where everyone pulls together to accomplsh the impossible - turning an old barn into a church. This is a movie about acceptance, forgiveness, and changed lives - and I highly recommend it!",1252886400,6,754,4.992063492063492
2891953,4,B000T28C86,"I watched this movie primarily because Brad Stine (the superb comedian) is in it.  I am glad that I did.

Although Stine is not one of the lead characters, the show is well done and has a good message.  Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) is a female pastor who is fired from her job due to her unorthodox methods.  She and her son, Hayden (Bobby Edner), move to a small town, Paradise, where she takes over a small congregation.

Some of the people in the church don't seem to get the essence of the Christian faith (loving God and loving people).  Debbie focuses on that and makes a real impact.

There is a lot of good drama regarding a destructive fire, the church pulling together, and lots more.  This is a thought provoking show that is well worth watching.  It is not a high budget production with lots of special effects, etc.  It does however contain lots of other good elements.  It is well worth watching.",1241222400,,914,4.4787878787878785
2891954,4,B000T28C86,"Welcome to paradise, well it is fantastic to see a beautiful and clean movie. i bought this movie purely because brad stine was in it, and i was very surprised with his performance. it has a great message about the church being the people not the building, about getting together as a community and about reaching those jesus hung out with the poor the less fortunate, it was also great to see a female preacher, we are all gods children so why shouldn't we all preach.

highly reccomended movie for the whole family",1229904000,,516,4.548387096774194
2891955,5,B000T28C86,"I loved this movie and would love to see it turn into a television program. There is so little on TV these days.  What a wonderful, wholesome show this would make.

I've tried to send my comments to the stars and director of the movie; however, I can't find an address.  Hopefully, they'll read this!

2891957,2,B000T28C86,"Although the basic story is OK, this movie disappointed me.
 - Full of stereotypes.  None of the characters surprised me or broke the mold.  In particular, it portrays Texans and Christians unflatteringly and (in my experience) inaccurately.  Some of the stereotypes were offensive, and all contributed to making this a boring movie.
 - I've never seen so many homeless people with perfect teeth!  Also, none of the homeless had any moral flaws.  Not all homeless people are immoral, but substance abuse, thievery, and sexual immorality are pretty common.
 - Many times, the back-and-forth in dialogs was choppy and unnatural.  In general, I thought the production was second-rate
 - Crystal Bernard was not a believable preacher.  Brian Dennehy and Brad Stine did quality work, but the other leads were mediocre.
 - Although this was supposedly about church and Christianity, it was really about mostly nice people responding to crises.  God really didn't play a role.

Overall, this movie is a snoozer at best and offensive at worst.",1217980800,3,1035,5.156626506024097

  I really like this movie as I am a pastor's wife and the story is very believable.
  It is a good story with exciting scenes.
It shows the difficulties of being a woman pastor.",1214438400,,216,4.605263157894737
2891959,5,B000T28C86,"My husband and I watched this movie together, twice. What a pleasure to find a wholesome film instead of the usual trash with foul language, people hopping into bed after the first kiss on the first date and then moving in together the next week. Our culture has degenerated so badly that a movie this clean is a rare find. I loved the quirky characters, the heart-felt optimism, the Christianity at the core of the story, and the honesty about man's ego in conflict with God's total acceptance of human kind with all our frailties. It was refreshing to see characters unblemished by the big-city degradation brought about from illegal drugs and gang violence. When I watch a movie, I don't want to deal with the gritty realities of the sordid life. Instead, I want to be inspired. To me, the greatest hope in this movie was that such places as Paradise might still exist in this country. I really loved this movie.

2891961,3,B000T28C86,"I enjoy a good Warm, sensitive family films. However when a film pulls too much on the heartstrings, the feeling is sourness. That is how I feel about Welcome to Paradise

Reverand Debbie Laramie (Crystal Bernard) and her son, Hayden (Bobby Edner), are forced to move to Paradise, Texas due to the unorthodox methods Debbie uses in her sermons.

Then her crisises begin. Her son become distant to her, She also find out her has a reading problem She also meet a lot of resistance from Paradise church-goers who don't believe in female ministers.  She opens her friendship to the homeless, which angers her church-goers. Then her church burns down due to one of the homeless people.

Minster  Debbie and the small flock  ally together to rebuild another church in one or  the district bishop decides to not  let the charter stand.

Lets say this Bernard and actors Connie ray,  Brian Dennehy and William Shockley (who also co-wrote this script) steal this film. Director and co-writer Brent Huff directs this film simple and without too many arty directive angles. The small film is got a heart  the size of texas, it is that script that brings this film down

I admit this film tries to inspire. Its message is never give up. However  The writers throw too much into the swirling mess of this picture to give the audience a chance to enjoy this

This film ends happy, like a good family film does. I rate it three stars because it is not great filmmaking, but it aint from the dung heap either. It is better than a lot of choices out there for a family to watch
