8317104,2,B000MK4UH2,"Forgive me if I'm wrong but I would agree the copy I received is a little off. I am certain in some translation it might be a little off but it seems there was not much effort put in to correct this. There are a few points already in the 3 episodes I have watched where they said something and the English sub provides a dialogue that doesn't make any sense. I'm happy enough to have the show in my possession but its about all I can offer as a pro, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.",1363996800,,494,3.95
8317105,1,B000MK4UH2,"I bought this item in the mistaken belief that something sold through Amazon.com must be a legitimate release. When I received the item though, it turned out to be a bootleg, an illegal copy. Looking back, I should've been suspicious right away, but since it was my first purchase of a DVD I didn't know what to expect.

Clues that it is a bootleg that can be checked before buying are: the very low price as compared to other releases, the number of discs (26 episodes are normally put on six discs, while this set has 28 episodes on just three), the omission of a manufacturer (it's 'fx', a known bootleg company), and the all-region coding (which is rare for legitimate releases).

Additionally, the actual box didn't have any copyright information on it, no barcode or ISBN number, not even the name of the manufacturer save for the fx logo. The discs didn't have any copyright notice or manufacturer on them either.

I hope this review will keep other customers from making the same mistake I made. The seller gave me a refund after I notified him, but it's still disappointing that my first anime purchase turned out to be an illegal copy.

I also hope Amazon will remove this item from their catalogue quickly. There's probably some fine print somewhere that says they're not responsible for third party sales, but it was still their reputation that led me to expect better.",1224115200,17,1381,4.694214876033058
8317106,4,B000MK4UH2,"This is a pretty good anime itself and it does indeed have episode 28, however the scene selection menu doesn't work too well for the last chapters (on either a DVD player or computer), and it hangs up just on a computer at those points too. The disks didn't have any scratches and are clean so I guess it has something to do with how they constructed the menus for it.",1193011200,4,369,4.211267605633803
8317107,5,B000MK4UH2,"At first i thought it would be a bootleg but it wasnt. It might just depend on who you get it from, but mine was perfect, came with all discs and everything its says.",1190246400,3,166,3.911764705882353
