3436899,4,B0019ESNFK,"Dracula is perhaps one of literature's most famous monsters and although many contemporary books and movies have transformed vampires into heartthrobs and prime-time soap stars, Bram Stoker's Dracula remains a true villain. This documentary appears visually to be the work of an amateur, although the actual narrated content proves otherwise. The documentary is extremely well-researched and provides a revealing look into the life of Dracula's creator - Bram Stoker. It explores the influences of gothic and occult cultures and details how these elements appeared in other literary works as well. I think I was introduced to the novel in high school and didn't really give it much thought then. It was fascinating to learn how much time Stoker spent researching to create his legendary character. Vampire fans and literature enthusiasts alike will enjoy this eye-opening Diary of a Vampire.",1294272000,,891,5.41726618705036
3436900,4,B0019ESNFK,"The way this DVD started with the opening credits I expected it to be really cheesy, but I was pleasantly surprised!  This film is filled with lots of great scenes and photos, mostly focusing on Bram Stoker and the novel he spent 8 years gathering information for: Dracula.  Although Mr. Stoker wasn't the one who invented the idea of vampires, he's definitely the author who is synonymous with the name Dracula.  Because of his book, written over 100 years ago, people today are as hooked on vampires as they were over a century ago.  Whether you find them intriguing or frightening--or a little of both--without Bram Stoker vampire lore may have faded into oblivion.  Diary of a Vampire also gets into occult secrets hidden in the works of authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne.  This film is a must-see for anyone interested in vampires and their history, as well as Bram Stoker and how the novel Dracula came to be born.",1288396800,,952,4.704819277108434
3436901,3,B0019ESNFK,"The actual production values are mainly computer animated by what appears to be an 18 year old boy.  The number of bikini clad vampires was amusing but counter productive.  THE BIG PLUS: The actual narration, research, and script is incredibly deep and insightful.  The material presented was more sophisticated than what I received in some of my master-level English courses.

As an educator I found the scope and contextualization of Stoker's work extremely valuable.  I had hoped to show it to some of my students; but as I said, it looks more like a racy video game than a serious documentary.

Well worth a look...but realize you will not get a product with the same values as say AE's Biography or The History Channel",1268956800,,723,4.790322580645161
3436902,3,B0019ESNFK,"This DVD shows up in searches on Amazon.com, when searches are done for the actor, Gary Oldman. Nowhere, on this DVD is he mentioned or shown.
Gary Oldman was in the movie Dracula, but does not appear in this DVD.
I had to assign a rating, in order to post this information. I do own this DVD.",1237680000,6,293,4.157894736842105
3436903,4,B0019ESNFK,"The ""birth"" of Dracula, the origins of Gothic style and stories as they relate to the life and times of Bram Stoker. Was he a bigot who believed Muslims studied the occult? Were occult secrets hidden in the works of authors such as Alexandre Dumas, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jules Verne? Pretty compelling stuff!",1216425600,,307,4.703703703703703
3436904,5,B0019ESNFK,I am a huge vampire fan!  I love anything from the cheesy to the scary.  Bram Stoker definitely leans to the scary!  His groundbreaking Dracula creation in 1897 was prefaced with eight years of researching European folklore.  He was dedicated to his craft and it has shown!  This background information is in a very watchable format and is highly recommended to any vampire fan!,1214352000,5,378,4.84375

8273858,5,B0019ESNFK,This was very good.  It is a done like a documentary and really makes you thinkabout what was happening in the world back in the 1800s and how Bram Stoker and others may have set the course for where we have arrived today.  I enjoyed it and am looking for more movies by this company because it intriged me and there are things that happened long ago that were true in the movie such as the Masonites back then and before.  Very good.,1384732800,,434,4.204819277108434
8273859,4,B0019ESNFK,"Absolutely fascinating! I am a huge fan of the vampire genre, and you can't get much better than Dracula himself. Bram Stoker was a VERY important man--he didn't realize it at the time, but he changed the face of our culture to forever include the Vampire. This was interesting and full of information that was new to me. Stoker was even more incredible than I once thought!",1374883200,,374,4.597014925373134

8273861,5,B0019ESNFK,Was there more to the Dracula story than meets the eye? That's what this video sets out to explore. I was really impressed by the information uncovered here. Bram Stoker was a trippy guy to be sure. Don't miss this one.,1374883200,,219,4.365853658536586

8273863,3,B0019ESNFK,"I thought this was a cool DVD about Bram Stoker and what his life was like.  His world was very different than ours.  I thought it was great--it's what I was looking for.  If you find vampires and everything surrounding them interesting, including authors on the subject, then you'll find this interesting because that's exactly what it is.  Information about a man who was surrounded by vampires (metaphorically or otherwise).",1355961600,,427,5.057142857142857
8273864,1,B0019ESNFK,"Let me revise the review title above... I actually didn't watch the whole thing through. The first 15 minutes was enough. Awful and tedious CGI of a vampire slut intertwined with a live actor playing a vampire hunter. I mean really bad CGI. Something that would not have made it into the lowest rank amateur video game of the early 1990s. The Scorpion King effect at the end of The Mummy II looks like Pixar's Brave or even the recently produced Beowulf in comparison. It could have been good! The heart was there. You can see that under the right producer and budget it could have been grand. But it is not. I feel guilty about writing negative reviews and this is my first one I think, but I needed to let you.",1354838400,,712,4.360902255639098
