8526446,4,B000KKUK1O,"I recall seeing the AFT's ""Galileo"" in a Dallas theater back in 1975, when the city had its own censorship board to put teeth in the MPAA ratings and thereby protect the morals of local youth. The All Fools' Day scene, irreverent and bawdy, did offend some, including a few of my college-age students, and over the years the only American-formatted VHS and DVD releases I've been able to locate have all contained such a drastically cut version of this scene that it failed to make narrative sense. I took a chance on this Australian release, figuring that the folks Down Under would be less prudish, and was delighted to find that their ""Galileo"" squared with my (PG) memories. Let's be clear, though, that ""Galileo"" aims to give audiences the sense that they're watching filmed theater, and specifically a theater that would have won Brecht's approval. My guess is that US theater and film audiences have become more cosmopolitan over the last 35 years, so ""Galileo"" will be less of a stretch for viewers today. Still, it contains elements that some will not care for.  The excellent transfer restores the film's jarring contrasts in the lighting of realistic and anti-realistic sets. This will make it a challenge for viewers who (as they say) like to forget they're watching a film. Some will be put off by the poorly recorded voices of the soprano and treble choristers who introduce some scenes. There will still be some who object to the All Fools' Day scene (though anyone who's had a college course in theater will know what to expect in a Carnival scene). And for many, Topol will seem a weird choice for the title role (maybe the filmmakers wanted to give Galileo a ""man from Mars"" distance from the down-to-earth (and dangerous) types around him). All in all, however, those who love Brecht in spite of his often wrongheaded theories about theater, and who especially love his collaborations with various composers (in this case the underrecognized Hanns Eisler), this rendition of ""Galileo"" is worth checking out.",1297296000,3,2026,4.872463768115942
