4107302,5,B003BOUKRU,"If you love Celine Dion for her talent, rise to success and great humanitarian spirit you'll love this DVD.  It is primarily footage of her non-stage activities during her Taking Chances World Tour with some bits and pieces of the on-stage concert performance thrown in.  If you are looking for the music video of the concert then you want to purchase her DVD/CD package.  Strangely, the concert video is only available in DVD format and NOT Blu-Ray.",1277596800,2,450,4.818181818181818
4107303,5,B003BOUKRU,"Having seen the concert at the Sprint Center in KCMO the DVD  rekindled the excitement of the event and the talent that Celine Dion brings to any concert!
  She is so professional and real, her fans like myself are dedicated to her music and heart she bring joy to all of us. I highly recommend the DVD rather you attend the concert or not, once you once you watch it - consider yourself there!

4107304,5,B003BOUKRU,"This has to be one of the best Videos I have ever watched. I'm aware that its more of a documentary than anything else but I've never seen so much emotion, happiness, love and joy. This lady's love and respect for her fans, crew and the Countries she visited are unsurpassed. She goes all-out to please her fans everywhere she goes. Its hard to believe the grueling hardship that everyone goes through to see to it that her concerts are successful. If you are expecting nothing but music then this is not for you, although I can't think anyone wouldn't enjoy watching this video..",1276905600,,580,4.586538461538462
4107305,3,B003BOUKRU,"This is the most self-indulgent documentary I've ever seen.  This is a home video basically.  She is very fugly when you look at her upclose without hair.  She's definitely an airhead.  I've never heard her say a word other than love, passion and heart.  Listen especially to her speech at that Asian press conference where she was asked to talk about ""power.""  haha Having said that, I enjoyed it because I like some of her songs and watching her ride in her little plane with an oxygen mask on.  My favorite songs are It's All Coming Back and To Love You More.  I had tickets to one of the Vegas shows that she cancelled after the audience was sitting in their seats for an hour.  No medical breakthoughs when you see a crew of doctors shoving cameras in her mouth, she just likes the attention.  Her oxygen mask is a placebo.  This disc is the full 3 hour documentary.  The version in theatres was a 2 hour edit.  I like how the netflix description said she did all this while raising a child at the same time because we know she did all the work there!  haha.  I like it when she beats her chest and her fingers go spastic then she salutes!  Overall, it's a funny little flick and it actually shows a lot of full song performances from the tour.  It's very long though.",1275523200,,1273,4.326271186440678
4107306,5,B003BOUKRU,"Celine at her best! Can't say enough about this DVD...you must get this if you are a Celine fan!
The label for the Concert and Documentary are switched. Anyone else have this error?",1275091200,,181,4.515151515151516
4107307,5,B003BOUKRU,"I didn't expect to learn anything about Celine Dion through watching this movie other than she's extremely rich, is nice to people, and has a child with no personality. While all that is true, what can be learned through watching this is just what drives Celine to continue her strenuous career. The most interesting part of the documentary is when Celine begins having vocal problems. She cancels some shows which lets down many of her fans. She recovers but the vocal problems return. Before one concert is about to begin, she tells her crew that she is having a hard time speaking. She is reluctant to go on with the show but does anyway. She manages to make it through but her voice sounds strained as she belts out ""All By Myself."" After the show, someone says to her ""Well, it's over"" and Celine replies ""Yes but at what cost?"" knowing that straining her voice in this manner could permanently damage her voice. Moments later you find out just why she went on with the show. She's confronted with a fan who says she was in ICU and thinking of Celine helped her want to live. It is moments like this that you see just how connected Celine is with her fans. And looking out in the audience during any of her concerts, you will see just how connected they are to her. Critics can say what they want, but Celine has touched the lives of millions of people around the world and this film shows the obligation she feels towards them to not let them down.

At the end of the movie, when the tour is over Celine is asked how long until she is performing again. She says a year and a half. I really wish she would reconsider that. She needs way more rest than that. Her fans are loyal and will wait however many years it takes. But Celine really needs to take an long break from performing these grueling schedules. Barbra Streisand's voice didn't start to fade until she was in her 60's. Celine's voice is already starting to weaken and she's only in her 40's. She really need to take care of it if she wants to have a career as long as Barbra's.

Celine really is one of the hardest working women in show business and she is one hell of a performer. Her concerts are high energy and women (and men) love watching her on stage. You would think her concerts would be filled with mostly women but looking at the footage in this documentary shows it's pretty evenly split among genders of who is a fan. And I really doubt all the guys are gay.

I also gotta say this documentary looks fantastic on BluRay.",1273881600,4,2500,4.383620689655173

4107313,2,B003BOUKRU,"While I understand this is a film documentary and not a concert, there is way too much talk and not nearly enough music.

Even the live songs shown are just small cuts of the entire tune. I may have missed another full length performance of a song, because I found myself fast forwarding a lot, but ""My Heart Will Go On"" was the only one I found.

Gonna pick up her live in Las Vegas release, that looks like a complete concert.",1409356800,2,428,4.2073170731707314

4107326,4,B003BOUKRU,"Boston fans will be disappointed! No behind the scenes from there(first city she made a concert back in America). I was there and would like to see some footage included!)I also didn't like the songs they included in the middle of the movie (not that I don't like to see Celine singing)its just that I wanted to see as much behind the scenes as possible. The concert Dvd is included in this box set, so I didn't think it was necessary to repeat that on ""Through the eyes of the world"" In addition, the pics are TINY, except a FEW that have a good size. You need a magnifying glass to see them! I kid you not!! (very disappointing...)for such expensive item, I was expecting great pictures, I hope that one day they publish a book with descent size photographs!! Otherwise, Celine is just a delight to watch and it was wonderful to see how much hard work she put into it and the tremendous amount of love and respect she has for her fans! I'm a huge fan, and after watching this dvd I love her even more... :)",1285113600,,1008,4.310526315789474
