8474269,5,B005I5M4OW,"Bruce Chiu exemplifies what can be achieved when someone not only loves what they do, but also puts in the due dilligence to learn it well.  This video offers a good introduction for beginners plus the higher level skills and applications will sharpen your existing method and offer new perspective.  I liked it immensely and thought if showed a Master's ability to teach on many levels at the same time.

Hope you like it to,
