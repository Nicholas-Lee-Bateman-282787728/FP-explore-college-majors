4150081,3,B003L8K5VC,This was what you call a big flop!  The only reason why I purchase the cd was it was filmed in the area I come from and recognized most of the individuals that played extras,1356566400,,173,3.942857142857143

4150083,5,B003L8K5VC,"I finally got lucky and found this movie. The book is outstanding, how does One steal 7/8's of a train? I've seen Anthony Quinn revewed as having the same Ol' overdone act. I've never thought so, ""Shoes of A Fisherman"", etc. But for Comedy and Drama this movie takes the cake. Anyone with any experience with Native Americans and Reservations in the1800's to the 50's, 60's, 70's & beyond, etc will see this movie as ""Right On"" =///=====> (Think Wounded Knee So. Dakota in the 70's & Earlier the - 1800's).! Dam great cast, And Who woulden't love the Lawyer.? A lovable Lawyer..?  YUP.  G-G",1350000000,,590,4.609523809523809
