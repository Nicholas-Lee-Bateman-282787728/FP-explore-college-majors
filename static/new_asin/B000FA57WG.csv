2556862,1,B000FA57WG,"Oh how lovely. Joe Dante decided he was a political pundit now. Since it's apparent people will believe anything put to celluloid, I guess Mr. Dante decided that writing a book would be too much work. Everyday, new evidence is presented that debunks the myth's told by the left about the war. Could it be that with the facts piling up for the republicans, that good, patriotic(read socialist) liberals have decided to use their clout in their chosen industries to launch expensive, and visually appealing propaganda to help turn the tides in an election year? I am sure the jokes will be adequately funny, and the gore first rate; but if I really want funny Gore, I'll rent An Inconvenient Truth.",1152835200,13,696,4.760330578512397
2556863,4,B000FA57WG,"Dante's episode no doubt will get the most uneven reviews due to the fact that he made a political film.  Personally, I love my horror films and the music I listen to, to be politic-free.  I always felt that politics goes against what a good horror film(or song) should be.  It's one of the few escapes from the harsh realities around you, so why should it invade my entertainment?  There are always exceptions to the rule however.  After all, a good song is a good song, and a good film is a good film regardless.  Even the original Night Of The Living Dead had a message.  I really enjoyed Dante's episode.  Some people sure won't and don't from what I see, but to take this seriously is...stupid actually.  Dante himself says in the documentary that the film is biased and exaggerated.  I don't think he's trying to give America a wakeup call or change our minds, but instead is venting his own thoughts through a horror film.  That's the beauty of this Masters Of Horror series.  The directors all have carte blanche to do whatever the hell they want.  Stuart Gordon wanted do adapt Lovecraft, Coscarelli wanted to do a Lansdale story, Landis wanted do do something a tad lighter, why not Dante doing a political satire?  Yeah, I see what Dante's saying.  He's pounding his message right down on our heads.  I certainly have my own opinions on the war and the soldiers fighting there, but  I don't let this film influence that.  It's horror fantasy, message or not, and I watched it with more of a ""what if this really happened?"" state of mind than anything else.  Dante could have done this about Vietnam or Korea, it wouldn't make a difference to me.  I've always enjoyed Dante's brand of comedy/horror, and that's how I watched this film.  It's not really scary, nor is it as funny as some have stated, but I still like it.  Compared to the rest of the Masters series it is a bit of a lesser episode.  The zombies aren't really played for laughs, nor do they rip people to shreds like Romero's, but it's quite entertaining nonetheless.  In a way I'd almost compare it to Bill Lustig's Uncle Sam film.  Both would be great for a 4th of July double feature.  But whether you agree with Dante or not, horror fans should see this for the basic fact that it's entertaining.  Not Dante's best work by a longshot, but entertaining in that schlocky way I dig.",1152403200,10,2358,4.513002364066194

This is obviously tongue-in-cheek and I completely disagree with the antiwar message, but still, it was fun to watch. That is one of the many beauties of this great country-- the freedom to make films that trash people who don't agree with you.

Dante is no George A Romero, but managed to direct a ""subversive"" film that is original, but totally lacks suspense. This is a dark comedy, and anyone who thinks this film will persuade people to be anti-GOP, is an idiot. You will come out of this with the same political views you had before (but will never see Ann Coulter in the same light-- bless her soul).

2556866,5,B000FA57WG,"HOMECOMING is an astonishing piece of work by screenwriter Sam Hamm and director Joe Dante. They use the horror-film format to deal with the horrors our nation has experienced in the last several years -- an unelected regime inflicting a senseless war on the world while stigmatizing political opposition as unpatriotic. Dante and Hamm, drawing from the story ""Death and Suffrage"" by Dale Bailey, show dead soldiers coming back from Iraq to try to stop the carnage. These zombies are treated sympathetically -- they're not out for blood, they're soldiers out to restore the democratic values for which they thought they were fighting. Dante has long proven himself a master of both horror and satire, and here he perfectly balances his complex cinematic style to make a film that is deeply serious, compassionate, and moving -- as well as wildly funny in a black-comedy vein. Since it would be hard to get financing for a large-scale mainstream Hollywood film directly confronting these issues, HOMECOMING is these guerrilla filmmakers' alternative way of bringing the truth to our screens. Anyone who attacks this film as ""unpatriotic"" is willlfully or perhaps disingenously missing the point. This is a truly patriotic film, one filled with a mournful love for our country and an anger over what it has become. -- Joseph McBride",1149120000,7,1330,5.105504587155964

I found it powerful and moving and the attacks the show has received tend to be from those Bush supporters who unquestionally follow the lying thief's word.

2556868,1,B000FA57WG,"I really liked the masters of horror.  I saw most of them, and even when they didn't knock my socks off I still found them more or less entertaining...except for this one.  This episode is a political message being disguised as a horror movie. A Republican spokesman says that if the soldiers who have died in this controversial war could come back they would be in total support. Well, this causes the dead soldiers to actually come to life back and become anti-war protesters.  The message isn't subtle: Republicans are evil, and so is George W. Bush.  Now I don't care if you agree with that message or not, but the way that this episode goes about dealing it out is insulting.  The characters are flat and lifeless: the Republicans are boiled down to people who are liars, opportunistic, and for some reason are into S&M.  While at the same time the Democrats are wise, rationale, and any other positive word you can think to use.  If you want to get people to think about important issues like this then it must be done more even handed, using the reasonable arguments from each side of the issue.  This one doesn't do that.  It takes the closed-minded approach of ""I'm right, you're wrong and that's it"", and I for one found it completely insulting.",1146873600,18,1255,4.591928251121076
2556889,2,B000FA57WG,"I guess judging by the reviews, this is a love it or hate it type of film. I happen to fall under the latter category.

""Homecoming"" is directed by Joe Dante who also directed one of my favorite horror films of all times,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling</a>. There he was able to incorporate humor with bone-chilling terror. Something he doesn't do too well with ""Homecoming"". The humour is there but the horror is nowhere to be found. This well acted mess about soldier zombies coming back to life to vote is a commentary on the Bush administration and the war it's most famous for but as a horror tale, it left me cold (no pun intended) and bored to pieces. Personally, I do not care if a film is trying to make a political statement that I agree or disagree with. I watch films, and especially horror films (my favorite genre) to be entertained and Dante failed me. Go ahead and bash the previous (then current) administration using art but come on, if you are going to make a zombie movie than you better deliver the gory goods; severed limbs, entrails, brains, ripped apart flesh, blood squirting in every direction, a few  scenes of the putrefied green yuck emanating from the undead's rotting flesh etc. I sat through this zombie film and got none of the above. Maybe a few scenes of tame violence and decent zombie make-up. Even Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" gave me more goosebumps than this turkey. Maybe John Landis should have been the choice to direct this installment since he did a pretty good job with that music video and his contribution to season one was a lot more successful in combining comedy with some mild tension. At least, his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deer-Woman/dp/B000F3UACK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deer Woman</a>&nbsp;was wickedly amusing.

The pacing is also excruciating. At barely 60 minutes the film moves at a turtle's pace and by the time the end credits start rolling, that is, if you're still awake, you're left questioning how a 2 hour long movie only took 60 minutes? The reason this escapes a one star rating is because Thea Gill gives a great performance and by her presence alone, the entertainment value of this short piece is raised slightly and the zombie make-up is not half-bad. As far as the horror is concerned, well, how do I put this mildly? There is none. If you're looking for thrills, chills and disturbing spills, you're better off watching an episode of ""Dancing with the Stars"". Unless your idea of time well spent is spending 60 minutes of your life watching overtly cheesy zombie's trying to make a political statement. One of the most disappointing episodes of the series.",1258502400,,2793,5.188470066518847
2556890,5,B000FA57WG,"The first of a few Masters of Horror films I've collected, this one is completely awe inspiring. Imagine if all the soldiers who went ignored came back from the dead to voice their concerns about the people who sent them to war. Many on here see it as a bad ""propaganda"" film taking shots at conservatives. While it does exchange blows with the last ""adminstration"", it's really a human story about the folks engaged in the Irag/Afghanistan war on a much deeper level they failed to see.

The zombies are a metaphor for how we treat our vets coming home from unpopular wars, how they are shunned and turned away like they were lepers. The most touching aspect of the film was the zombie wandering in the rain, when the shopkeep invites the creature in and cares for it much like their son still in the war. Their outrage and hatred of coming back to a divided country rather than a ticker tape parade seems justified. What were they really dying for? A country that when they left was united in a cause and come back to find it divided in physical conflict over interests in the war.

Again, this isn't a ""propaganda"" film. See it for what it is, a human story about our vets from Vietnam on up to now, feeling the hurt and anger at how they are turned away like a plague for heeding our country's call to arms in sometimes unwarranted war.",1252972800,,1340,4.421052631578948
2556891,4,B000FA57WG,"Homecoming is a very clever film focusing on the hypocrisy of flag-waving Chicken-Hawks. The film's main character is a Neocon political hack who boldly states that all the soldiers who died in Iraq loved the war and would vote Neocon if they could. In true horror-movie fashion, the dead do rise and become politically active, in a non-Neocon manner.

What I liked most about the film is how the director shows us the true evil monsters in the movie: The Neocons. But the main point of the film is presented in a clever and sometimes funny way. I see some Neocon bootlickers have already reviewed this film; to them ""patriotism"" means cowardly obeying the guy in the room with the most money, not defending the constitution. How sad.

2556892,3,B000FA57WG,"Masters of Horror: Homecoming (Joe Dante, 2005)

I had no idea, when I first found about about this Joe Dante short from the Masters of Horror series, that it was based on my favorite Dale Bailey story, else I'd have endeavored to track it down a lot sooner than I did. And while Dante has a much heavier hand with the social commentary than does Bailey, Homecoming is still more fun than two-- yes, two!-- barrels of monkeys.

David Murch (Jon Tenney) is a professional spin doctor working for the current government's administration, who have gotten involved in a very unpopular war. (Sound familiar?) One night, while on a talk show, confronting a woman whose son was killed in the hostilities, Murch wishes, aloud, that her son weren't dead. Unfortunately, the dead hear-- and it's not just the dead from this war. They're all rising, and they all have a goal. But what? (That is the major spoiler, and the punchline, and you'll just have to watch it.) While public opinion about the zombies is at first what one would expect, as the zombies start integrating themselves, the public begins to support their right to exist, and from there, everything starts getting really, really complicated.

Dante, whose career has been exceptionally low-key ever since 1989's The 'burbs (a fun film, but it bombed badly at the box office), has been quietly cranking out two kinds of movies for the past twenty years-- big-budget stinkers (Small Soldiers, Looney Tunes: Back in Action) and quiet, indie flicks that are actually worth your time (Matinee, The Second Civil War). His seeming growing fascination with sociopolitical commentary is increasingly obvious in his choice of projects, so Homecoming was a natural fit for him. He hasn't learned to do it subtly yet, but then anyone expecting subtlety from the guy who directed Gremlins is probably looking in the wrong direction. His signature blend of comedy and horror, however, is just as strong as it ever was, and he turns in an enjoyable Masters of Horror episode here. But do yourself a favor and read Bailey's much-superior story when you're done. ***",1212105600,,2104,4.904494382022472
2556893,3,B000FA57WG,"During a contentious presidential campaign,  a government mouthpiece (Jon Tenney) publicly wishes that the soldiers killed in Iraq could come back long enough to let the American people know how they feel about being called on to make the ultimate sacrifice in that cause.  Dead soldiers begin to return as zombies who are less interested in eating brains than casting ballots--against the current administration.  This puts the right wing spin machine into overdrive, providing director Joe Dante with ample opportunity to skewer neo-conservatives for hypocrisy and cynicism.

Your opinion of this episode is bound to be colored by your feelings about the war in Iraq, so I'll be up front with mine--I've been against it from the start.  Yet this episode still doesn't sit well with me.  Conservatives are criticized for claiming to speak for dead soldiers to make a political point, but isn't that what Dante and screenwriter Sam Hamm have done with their script?  Does it make it right just because they are on the other side of the issue?  The allegory is rather heavy-handed, but it has a pleasantly creepy atmosphere up until the zombie agenda is revealed, and Thea Gill is funny as a thinly veiled Ann Coulter castrating conservative babe.

It is not funny, so it fails as satire.  And because it tries so desperately to be satire and propaganda, it fails as horror.

Clearly, the people involved in this sad project hate conservatives--which is fine.  Many people do. But not many artists do to a degree that blinds their aesthetic judgments (Tim Robbins can churn out excellent parody, for example).  The script seems like it was written by an angry co-ed.

2556896,1,B000FA57WG,"Shame on you, Joe Dante.

You had the opportunity to participate in a project with the best of the best in horror, and *this* is what you pinch out?  A political diatribe with no true horror elements whatsoever?

I won't go into it here, as others have described the propaganda elements of this film much better than I could.  Suffice it to say that Dante offended me on so many levels - the *wrong* levels for a horror film - that I will never, ever watch another of his movies in my life.  He shall not profit from me ever again.

Dante takes clumsy, slanderous shots at the President, his staff, our servicemen, and the populace (basically he paints the picture that only a small number of us care about the fates of our soldiers).  If you have even an ounce of respect for any of these people or institutions - or yourself - this movie will make you see red.

Dante even takes a shot at George Romero by producing a zombie movie so utterly devoid of subtlety in its social commentary.  There's a scene where undead veterans are rising from their graves, and one of tombstones reads ""G. Romero.""  If George was down there, he'd be rolling.

Horror as entertainment is supposed to be an escape from the true horrors of our world.  You curl up in a dark room or theater, eat some popcorn, and when it's over you can hopefully look at the horrific events in our world with a different perspective.  Either Dante doesn't understand this, or he decided to say the hell with it and steal the opportunity to make the film he was obviously foaming at the mouth to produce.  In either case, Joe Dante is no Master of Horror.

This time around, the story concerns a world where right-wing political pundits inadvertantly cause dead American soldiers to come back to life.  David Murch (Jon Tenney) and Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill doing her best Anne Coulter imitation) offer up the typical Republican soundbites in defense of the (tactfully unnamed) President's ill-advised War in Iraq.  One of those soundbites?  ""I wish those soldiers COULD come back, because I'm sure they'd tell America how proud they were to serve and give their life for this great country of ours.""  Or something to that effect.  What do you know?  The Republicans get their wish.

Of course, the zombie soldiers AREN'T glad that they're dead.  And what is their idea of vengeance?  They demand the right to vote against the President.  That's right.  As soon as their dissenting ballots are cast, they drop lifelessly to the floor, their point having been made.

This little vignette makes ITS point in the first seven minutes of filming, and then it just keeps on making it over and over again.  Some have said that your enjoyment of the show will depend on your political bent, but I think any clear-headed individual can see that no matter your governmental ideologies, this is just one long, slow, poorly-written joke.  There IS some dark humor here, but it's also unintelligent, hateful, and obvious.

Ah well.  Propaganda isn't known for its tact.  ""Homecoming"" has a vendetta, and that's all it has.  I'm all for exposing corruption and deceit, but even if there are those who agree with this film's message (and many, many do), I fail to see how those same people can also agree with the film's self-righteous moralizing, its hate, its presumption.

After all, this little ""screw you"" to the current administration props up its high horse on the idea that the conservatives are only promoting their own selfish agendas by claiming to speak for America's fallen men and women.

2556934,2,B000FA57WG,"I am both a veteran and an indie film-maker (though I have not yet worked with a budget like this one had).  These are two facets that do have a bearing on my perspective, but they do not make me any less capable of recognizing virtue or merit - at least no less than others who write reviews.

Unlike many of the clearly strident and biased reviews writtenhave indicated, I feel that comedy and horror are visceral in nature, and that one's political and philosophical inclinations are separate factors which intrudes rather than enhances the nature of the sensations, though it is often hard for some to separate them.

Doing my best to review Homecoming objectively, I have to say it really wasn't a good film or story.  It wasn't scary or clever or entertaining or even very interesting.  It was mainly just a one-dimensional political rant where a horror film should have been, a dark comedy/satire which wasn't all that funny (granted, I am not an easy laugh), and campy B-movie propaganda where a clever story could have been told and presented.

One thing that does bother me is the hypocrisy that Dante and the other partisan screechers ultimately flaunt: they don't really care anything about those who serve this nation generally, or in a time of war specifically.  Neither he nor or other liberal ""cultural elitists"" who are so proud of themselves respect or appreciate what those who serve this country (let alone in wartime) go through and could not understand nor care less about their reasons for service.  Like many of their ilk (including the fatuous Matt Damon), they think those in the military do so because of a lack of options/money/education/etc.  To then presume to speak on the behalf of those who gave their life is not only disingenuous, but shameless.  I spent much of my career serving under a President (Clinton) whose attitude towards the military and its members was one of indifference at best and disdain the rest of the time.

What actually bothers me the most about this is Joe Dante being considered ""a Master of Horror"".  If any of those who raved about the ""message"" of this film had could put down your protest signs and Greenday posters and stop patting yourself on the back for a moment to examine the question honestly, you would have to admit to yourself that Joe Dante really didn't belong in a list of horror icon directors (besides The Howling, he just doesn't have the resume').  I realize that many of the stories and directors in this series have a political axe to grind, but at least John Carpenter and Dario Argento have earned their place among the Horror genre's esteemed (and I thought the vignette Cigarette Burns was really good, though I was a huge fan of In The Mouth of Madness, which it reminded me of).

Truth be told, you don't have to be a conservative or Republican to dislike this film.  And being a strident, ham-fisted propagandist doesn't make Joe Dante a good horror film-maker, let alone a legend in the Horror film genre.",1174867200,5,2995,4.721689059500959

But if you are no fan of the current administration and like political satire, you will be blown away by this entry in the MOH series. Great writing, wonderful acting, especially by the lead, Jon Tenney. People like Ann Coulter, Karl Rove, Jerry Falwell, and Dubaya deserve to be satirized. Thanks to Joe Dante for having the courage to make this episode. More MOH episodes should be like this.",1166918400,5,821,4.6689655172413795
2556937,2,B000FA57WG,"I can't follow the bandwagon of congratulations for Joe Dante's MOH episode; this is unfortunate because Joe is one of my heroes. I respect that it sets out to do exactly what Joe and co. wanted it to do, but in the end it comes off as more of an indictment of Anne Cultor than it does the Iraq War. But it isn't the politics that left me wanting in this particular film, it was the fact that Dante was able to make a balls-to-the-wall horror movie again (THE HOWLING being a particular favorite of mine), but that isn't at all what we get. In some ways it seems silly to complain, given that the war is true horror; but Dante is a monsterkid, and I was really hoping for something else. Again, I respect his decision and his choices with this particular story, I was just hoping for something a little more fun. Shallow perhaps, but I'm a B-movie maven all the way. I'm happy that he has received good notices for this episode (Dante is super underrated), and definitely recommend it to those who are not really horror, or B-movie, fans, who are looking for something with a little more substance. The film is well made, and very humorous (only Dante would crank the gag of having famous ""zombie"" directors names' littering a group of headstones up a notch by adding Del Tenney!), and I recommend it to those not looking for a ""horror"" movie.",1166745600,4,1343,4.441295546558704

I am an independent and really have my problems with both the Repugnantcans and the Devilcrats. However, the leftist elite with their high brow satire and constant screaming is enough to push me to the right. Anyway, back to this incredible piece of trash called a horror movie. It was neither horror nor the least bit funny. Throw a couple of zombies in with a conscience that fits your liberalism and I guess those who think as you do will be quite pleased.

2556949,4,B000FA57WG,"From Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling), who it is good to see doing some horror once again, Homecoming is one of the best in Showtime's Masters of Horror series, even though it's not very horriffic.  Jon Tenney stars as a political consultant and speech writer whose wish for a grieving mother gets granted in a deadly way when dead Iraq veterans return to life.  The catch here is that they're not coming back to feast on the living, they want their voices heard as the presidential election is right around the corner, and if they aren't heard, well then, you get the idea.  The political satire is superb here as Dante guides a brilliantly black comedy that aspires to be so much more, and it nearly gets there too.  The only real weak point of Homecoming is the denouement which seems rushed and not as strong as the first three quarters of the film, but other than that Homecoming fires on all cylinders.  The zombie makeup is superb (what else would you expect from industry vets Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger?) and Dante provides memorable moments throughout, particularly from one of his favorite actors Robert Picardo (and no, other Dante fave Dick Miller isn't here sadly), which rounds out the nice package here.  All in all, you might be bummed out by the lack of horror moments and gore in Homecoming, but the sharp political satire that is all too true helps make this one of the best in the Masters of Horror series.",1163376000,5,1433,4.622047244094488

At least not until they fulfil their purpose.  Should the dead be allowed to vote?  If they vote what impact will they have on the election?  The advisor thinks it would be a good idea to let them vote.  But what would happen if the dead vote but are not heard?  What do soldiers do when faced with overwhelming odds?

This story is vet political in nature even though it is thinly disguised as a zombie film.  The zombie effects are thin with most merely being simple makeup jobs.  Only a few show any real wounds or decay.  Again, this is a political film and as such it fails in the horror department.  Like in Sick Girl (also in this series), the ending almost seems like it should have been in Tales From the Crypt.  As Return of the Living Dead took zombies in a humorous direction, this movie takes them in a political direction.  A very interesting take but not scary at all.

The writing, directing, acting, effects, etc. has been on par and worthy of the name of the series, UNTIL Joe Dante's Homecoming.  I questioned why Dante was ""on the list"" to begin with, Homecoming has only supplied me with evidence as to why he is NOT a Master of Horror.

When the title credits roll, there is an expectation introduced, as if you are being told what is to come and promised quality.  In Dante's Homecoming we get nothing promised; what we actually get is a ""Hollywood Leftist"" view of the current situation in Iraq and Washington, political commentary with a lampooning of every ""Right-wing nut job"" in or around Washington, and Zombies who DON'T want to eat you, they just want to VOTE?

See, folks, regardless of your political status or views on the war or anything else; this is simiply NOT the place to air your anger over the situation.  As a fan of the horror genre, I want horror!, not political ""shots"" with a couple of zombies and one scene of horror thrown in for good measure.

Sadly, I thought this series was getting off to a great start, but now I wonder what is next.  Romero's look at Big Tobacco, Argento's take on Hezbullah, or perhaps we could hope for Cronenburg's sympathetic portrait of Castro?

2556954,4,B000FA57WG,"Joe Dante is the director of this notorious episode in the Masters of Horror series.  Dante's credits in the horror realm are noteworthy.  His first foray into the genre was 1978's cheesy guilty pleasure ""Piranha"".  In 1981, Dante lensed ""The Howling"" an absolute classic of the genre that is to this day still considered by many to be the best werewolf film ever.  His career really took off when Steven Spielberg (a big fan of ""Piranha"") hired him to make ""Gremlins"".  Released in 1984, the film became a humongous hit worldwide, even spawning successful lines of toys and trading cards.  While Dante has been rather quiet in the past decade, ""Homecoming"" marks a nice return to the genre for a director rightly bestowed the title of ""Master of Horror"".

Homecoming is quite unique within zombie lore, a genre that suffers from a decided lack of uniqueness.  Plot: On the verge of a Presidential election, a Republican spokesperson triggers an unexpected reaction when he wishes that those who perished in the war were alive and able to vote.  Instantly, deceased veterans rise from their star spangled banner-draped coffins looking to find peace and stop another term with a right-winged president, not by eating the brains of the administration that sent them to their graves but by stuffing the ballot boxes.

Only nominally a horror piece, Dante's episode is far more horrified by the smug, media-savvy culture of the contemporary right than it is the monsters sprung from the grave.  Clearly a man with major issues concerning the state of American media, politics and foreign policy, he openly confronts these feelings with a scathing satire of the American right, especially through the Jane Cleaver character.  Cleaver is a right-wing political commentator of the Ann Coulter mold who draws blood with sound bites, enjoys first date S&M sessions, and gleefully hoists a shotgun in the direction of the ""pussies"" and ""dissidents"" who dare return so liberally from the dead.

But while it's undoubtedly a fresh take on zombie lore, this episode is far from being without its faults.  Too often it suffers from inept acting and moments of insufferable cheese.  Also, the biased opinions and stereotypes of republicans is a bit of a turnoff, even if you're a liberal.  Homecoming screams ""message film"".  I loved Homecoming however I would have to disagree with the many people who believe this is the series' best episode.  For that, I would point to Don Coscarelli's ""Incident on and off a mountain road"", a heart-wrenching exercise in no-holds-barred horror.

I'm not sure whether to take this as a black comedy or an all-out slap against the current administration and its war, but either way I liked it a lot and I applaud Joe Dante for throwing it out there.  Seems as though veterans of a war (unnamed, of course, but we all know what it is) are rising up from the grave to....VOTE?  Yep, to vote, and not for the current president, either.  Too bad they were lied to and their votes didn't count, though, I'd hate to think about what happened later.  And for those who take this as an insult to our soldiers and our country, etc?

It's well-made, and there are one or two spots that are amusing satire, but it overstates the case so drastically that it will have very little impact.

As a horror film, it isn't scary; and as a political commentary, it's just preaching to the choir (the left half of the choir, anyway).  I might have liked it a bit more if there had been a trace of subtlety anywhere, but it's blud-and-thunder obvious.

As for its thesis ... well, not everyone in the military thinks the same, anymore than Americans in general.  However, with a volunteer army, there's a preponderance of so-called ""red state"" folks who tend to vote Republican.

This is one of the weakest in the ""Masters of Horror"" series.  If you're politically neutral, you might want to rent it and kill an hour.  If you're offended by simple-minded criticism of American foreign policy, you should skip this one.",1154908800,7,1028,4.698324022346369
2556957,5,B000FA57WG,"I find everyone's statements on here equally moving.  That is the whole point of making a movie is to entertain.  Even those who say they hated were still moved enough by it to put their dissent in writing.  Any movie, love it or hate, if it moves you in any way, was successful in that mission.

Those of you who don't like it - don't watch it.  I've always thought that Jerry Springer and shows like it would go away if the people criticizing it would simply change the channel.  We changed the channel with Dan Quayle - and he went away.

My biggest surprise after seeing this movie is why the national media haven't been raising holy hell on this one.  The dissenters will say it's because the movie sucked so badly, the fellow dissidents will say it's because of suppression or something like that.

To those who say this movie is despicable and not honoring our troops are relating more smokescreen poppycock for our naive consumption.

1) The reason our troops are fighting for us is for the very reason this movie is allowed to be made.  ""Dissent is the highest form of patriotism."" - Thomas Jefferson  Those of you who think it's wrong for someone to make something like this needs to go back and read a history book and then the Constitution again.  I find it very disturbing when people, especially those with political power, start saying what should be considered appropriate speech.  Ever heard of inalienable rights?  Where do you think those come from, Washington, D.C.? or the Almighty?

Someone who ""hated"" this movie will say that free speech doesn't give you the right to dishonor our country or our troops.  If that's true, please let me wash your feet, because only a power beyond us meer mortals can decide what rights we have and in what way we are allowed to practice them.

2) One can concede that the troops probably voted more for Bush than Kerry.  Lincoln did probably win reelection because of the soldiers vote.

While officers tend to be Republican, keep in mind that enlisted men tend to be Democratic.  After all, the military is more ethnically diverse than our own country at times - probably because they started 20 years before the rest of us thanks to integration with Harry Truman.  And, besides, when you make 12,000 a year, well I guess pocket book issues might matter a little more than to people than those who legitimize selfishness like Ann Coulter.

3) The movie never states who the soldiers are voting for, although it clearly implies it's not the Republicans.  The movie shows a bumbling nominee - presumably Kerry (although this one states to not have served in the military - which should make the conservatives happy because they can't fathom a real patriot or American for that matter that isn't a registered Republican).  To claim that this movie is disrespectful to our soldiers because of who they'd vote for implies that those folks believe they could have only voted Republican.  A truly scary omen in a democracy.

If you think the movie doesn't like our veterans, simply go back and watch the entire movie.  You must have missed that scene with the Af-Amer. couple and the soldier they take in.  They might be Democrats, well at least there's an 89% chance they didn't vote for Bush.",1153958400,20,3244,4.671957671957672

Luckily, my experience has been far more of the former.  We have a greater than 90% save rate over here for the wounded.  (You should see ""Baghdad ER"", also on DVD from Amazon, for that story.)  I saw this trash while in Iraq and could not have been more offended.  I am over here risking my life for the free speech of those who dissent but I cannot stomach lies told over the bodies of soldiers who have proudly given all for their country.  The writers of this lie have obviously not spoken to any soldiers who have been over here.  The vast majority who are injured are very saddened that they are leaving their buddies and that they themselves are out of the fight.  Every soldier from my unit who has been injured felt this way.  I know, I see every one of them.  Many who have died left letters to be sent to their families stating that they believed in what we are doing here and that they were proud of their service.  This film is a lie and not even good horror or satire.
  Judged on its own merits as a film, it falls far short.  The script is atrocious.  The plot is beyond predictable.  The characters are as one dimensional as it gets.  I watched this episode as part of a boxed set purchased in-theater and never would have watched it if I had known the premise prior to popping the disc in my player.  This is precisely the point of my review.  If you don't want to see someone who has never been a soldier try to speak for soldiers who are more than capable of speaking for themselves then don't watch this.  If you think you will be seeing good horror or even good satire then you will be be sorely disappointed.
  Interestingly, a later reviewer makes comments regarding the political and racial make-up of the current military.  Based on his comments, it is obvious that he has neither donned a uniform nor been deployed into the line of fire in a combat zone.  He has certainly never been in the US military.  I have worn the uniform both as an enlisted soldier and as a commissioned officer.  The purported divide in political beliefs is not that wide.  As far as free speech goes, I support the right to free speech more than anyone else.  That being said, it is a lie for me to put words in someone else's mouth and state that I speak for him when, in fact, I do not.  If I said a crtain later reviewer uttered a racial slur and he did not, this is not protected free speech.  It is slander.  If I print that then it is libel.  For example, when Cindy Sheehan says she speaks for soldiers and expresses what they want to say but cannot, she is a liar.  Her views are overwhelmingly denounced by soldiers.

2556985,4,B000FA57WG,"For starters I could understand why this episode of Masters of Horror has become such a polarizing phenomena in the blog-world of the internet. Joe Dante sure picked himself the perfect subject to satirize if what he wanted was to cause controversy and dialogue. His episode for the Masters of Horror anthology for Showtime was easily a Red State vs. Blue State episode. If you're a supporter of Bush then you'd hate this episode with a passion and probably call it everything from treasonous to awful. If you're not a supporter of Bush then you'd call this episode timely, thought-provoking and political satire at its best. There's not much room in the middle for how this episode pushes people's buttons.

The episode was adapted, and updated for the current geopolitical climate, from a short story by Dale Bailey titled ""Death and Suffrage"" by Sam Hamm. In the original short story the dead soon begin rising from the grave to head to the voting booth to cast their vote during a presidential election. Instead of dead soldiers as they're depicted in the MoH episode, the zombies were people killed due to gun violence. Joe Dante's ""Homecoming"" takes that basic premise but instead uses the current War in Iraq as the grievance the zombies have with the current political leadership. It's never mentioned that Iraq is the place the war is happening at, but one has to be very naive and living in a cave for the last three years not to read into it. There's not much what you could say as straight horror in ""Homecoming"". Sure there are zombies and a grisly death or two on screen, but the true horror of the episode is how the fantastical premise of the story does bear a politically charged message.

The Masters of Horror anthology series has been a hit and miss project and people's favorite episodes have varied. Joe Dante seems to have picked a story that he knows would be controversial and might be hated by people. He sure succeeded in that aspect of his choice. But I admire the guy for taking the baton of choosing something important to him and be-damned if people liked it or not. The direction is actually very economical and the pacing pretty fast. The entire episode is timed just under an hour, but the whole story breezes by very quickly and Dante still gets alot of his message through. The performance by Jon Tenney as David Murch the political strategist was very good and his transformation from manipulative political wonk to someone who fully understand why the dead soldiers are doing what they're doing is done well. Thea Gill as the Ann Coulter-ish Jane Cleaver and genre veteran Robert Picardo as the Karl Rove-ish Kurt Rand finishes out the other highlight performances in the episode. Thea Gill's performance as Jane Cleaver is hilarious and over-the-top until one realizes that even then her characterization of Jane Cleaver still falls wholly short of the real Ann Coulter.

Joe Dante's ""Homecoming"" was not your typical zombie story. There's no brain or flesh-eating to be seen throughout the hour-long episode. There's an abundance of great zombie make-up effects from the masters of KNB EFX. Some people truly hated this episode for its content and for not being truly horrifying. Some loved it for its condemnation and its anti-Bush administration rhetoric. I like to consider myself in the middle of it all. The episode was done well. I might not have been sold on every piece of political theme and message Dante bluntly put in the episode, but I have to admit that it did resonate. Plus, Dante's got marbles of steel for even filming and going through with this episode. I have to give the man his proper respect just for that alone.",1153094400,25,3676,4.776729559748428

But, like many concepts arrived at over drinks, this was a concept perhaps best left at the bar. The premise is pretty funny (or enraging if you're a die-hard conservative as many seem to be here.) But I certainly wouldn't elevate it to the level of ingenious social commentary.

The good points: As many have mentioned, spectacular ""Anne Coulter"" performance by Thea Gill. Overall basically entertaining premise. A few laugh-out loud scenes - mostly for their blatant rediculousness such as the first voting scene or the final patriotic stars and strips scene.

The bad points: Less subtlety than a Jersey Shore shouting match.

Overall worth a watch and a chuckle with friends around the water cooler but I can't recommend actually paying for it.",1342915200,2,1041,4.766666666666667

8119639,1,B000FA57WG,"masters of horror is my favorite show pretty much ever, but this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. I own over 500 dvds, most horror i can't believe anchor bay and the creators of this show thought this was good. if i did not collect sets and like to keep them complete i would throw this dvd away ""right hand to god""

the worst ""horror movie ever""
i would rather watch the grudge 2 and blair witch project for 2 days on a loop rather than watch half of this movie.",1322697600,,474,3.9894736842105263
8119640,3,B000FA57WG,"HOMECOMING is a decent piece of political, anti-war satire. Of course, this was handled far more expertly in Bob Clark's early 70's classic, DEATHDREAM. By comparison, this modern (Iraq instead of Vietnam) version seems somewhat heavy-handed, hitting us over the head w/ it's message w/ the subtlety of a pile-driver! In HOMECOMING, Joe Dante ups the ante, w/ hordes of soldier-zombies (unlike DEATHDREAM's single return visitor), rising from their flag-draped coffins in order to vote! Yikes! While I did enjoy this film, I would have liked it more if it hadn't been so blatant and preachy!...",1289606400,,594,5.197916666666667
8119641,5,B000FA57WG,"The movie is more political satire than horror. Thea Gill plays an Ann Coulter commentator. She is brash and described as a ""skank."" She flip-flops on her views in order to help the Republicans. The president (Bush) is described: ""He has a way of making stupid people feel as smart as he is."" The movie also satires the 2000 election. It essentially calls the people who started the war, anti-American traitors who betrayed the country. Soldiers have come back to life in order to vote. They don't attack humans unless provoked. They all have the zombie gait to them. As for ""horror"" I would give the movie one star as there is very little. If you are a Bush supporter, you might find yourself grinding your teeth at this one, as this has extreme liberal bias. For those on the left, this movie rocks!",1288224000,,801,4.569444444444445
8119642,4,B000FA57WG,"Some of the ""negative"" reviews seen here (and on [...], also) are mostly: ""HOW DARE JOE DANTE use a movie to make a political point?!?""  DUUH...apparently MANY people missed the ""political"" aspects ('twas satire, really) of G. Romero's 1st two ""Living Dead"" movies!  And what about science-fiction movies with themes/plots re: dystopian futures?  (Logan's Run, 12 Monkeys, Soylent Green, episodes of the Twilight Zone, the list goes on and on...)  OR people are complaining, ""Golly, the zombies don't EAT people, f'r cryin' out loud!""  It's FICTION, friends!!!  That's the great thing about fiction: One can take concepts/themes and ""tweak"" them 'til the cows come home to roost.

My point, if I have one: Homecoming is NOT a classic, but a very amusing low-budget hunk of satire!  (I loved Thea G's oh-too-thinly veiled take on Ann C, Queen of Selfishness!)  It would've been better as a 1/2-hour T. Zone-type ""short,"" actually.  It WAS/IS low-budget, but so are a LOT of horror films...at least Dante & Hamm had a POINT they felt they had to make!  If you don't LIKE or AGREE with that point, FINE -- that's your right.  But don't bust their ****s (or anyone else's) for STATING their opinion!  If you think it was lame as a MOVIE, say so!  I have my opinion of John Wayne as a ""super-patriot"" (despite all his flag-waving he NEVER served in the Armed Forces, btw), but if ""True Grit"" or ""The Cowboys"" is on TV, I STOP WHATEVER I'M DOING AND WATCH, politics be darned!  As for those who say Homecoming ""disrespects"" our Iraq War dead, WHERE WERE YOU FOLKS when GWB, a Texas Air Nat'l Guard ""warrior,"" walked onto an aircraft carrier DRESSED IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM with a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner behind him?!?!?  How would you feel if Clinton or Glenn Beck or Rush ""Pills"" Limbaugh addressed the USA dressed as a Green Beret, a Marine major, or an admiral?",1284854400,,1863,4.775
