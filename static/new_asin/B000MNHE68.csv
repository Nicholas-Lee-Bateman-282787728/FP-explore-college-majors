8644612,5,B000MNHE68,"What a great story about perseverance and overcoming obstacles and above all teamwork.  This is so inspiring and I highly recommend it.  I also recommend ""No Horizon is So Far"", a book where Ann Bancroft & Liv Arnesan cross Antarctica a few years after this expedition.  This book forces you to look at real life & death situations and pushing the human body to the max.  Amazing what the human spirit can accomplish.  Makes you realize your daily problems aren't so big, when you realize what these 4 women did!",1242950400,,512,4.644444444444445
