2432303,5,B000BOH8YG,"I loved this show when it premiered and watched it eagerly every week. I was in the Air Force then and remember this show being one of the absolute best on television. To those who are quick to forget, Hill Street Blues set the precedent for cop shows to come. By killing off key characters occasionally the show had a sense of stark, gritty realism that made most of the cop shows of it's time seem like 'Car 54'. This show was in the forefront of bold, daring originality. True, when Michael Conrad died there WAS a decline in the show because he was such a well-loved character, but the show retained it's greatness nonetheless. In MY book Hill Street will always be remembered as the show that all other cop shows, and even non-cop shows, tip their hats to.",1129248000,120,761,4.442857142857143
2432304,5,B000BOH8YG,"All my friends knew not to call, visit, or bother me in any way when Hill Street was on. I have been looking for a shirt with the original logo---police car grill with the words Hill Street Blues printed across it---for years.

This has to be THE best show anyone ever came up with. The first 3 seasons were the VERY best. I have been waiting for this show ( and China Beach ) to come out on DVD for so long. This is like an early Christmas present. I ordered it in a flash and so should EVERYONE.

EXCELLENT cast, scripts, performances----this show is pure genius.",1129248000,9,565,4.271028037383178
2432305,5,B000BOH8YG,"Hill Street Blues is one of those rare TV series: epochal! Introduced in 1981, before today's college students were born, it was the first of its genre, and on which L.A. Law, E.R., NYPD and The West Wing are based. Multiple scenarios progressed simultaneously involving several people, with some events ending, some continuing and others beginning in each episode. There was never a dull moment in this series and it holds the standard for winning so many EMMYS. From a wise-guy, make-a-buck-quick cop to the anal retentive SWAT team commander. Plus that great theme music. This is the one you want to own.",1129248000,9,607,4.902912621359223

2432307,5,B000BOH8YG,"The standard against what all other urban TV dramas are measured. From Roll Call to Lights Out... Multi-dimensional character development, hand held camera shots, extraodinarily talented actors who got their role because they truly fit the part not just because they are 'good looking'.

2432398,3,B000BOH8YG,"Hmmm, not sure this holds up as well as, say, NYPD Blue. It feels dated and not just because of the hair & clothing. I believe at the time it was considered 'gritty' but there was a distinct lack of (contemporary) grit. Still, the characters are interesting and there's real heat between Captain Frank Furillo and DA Joyce Davenport. I watched specifically for a glimpse of a young David Caruso playing the leader of an Irish gang.

2432428,5,B000BOH8YG,"Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue are the best of the TV police shows. They were when originally aired and are even more entertaining now. The new stuff is far too theatrical, melodramatic and factually far out. Glad I got season 1.",1453075200,,230,4.5

Seems Season 1, 2, 3 on streaming but the others are on video only.  ;(  Great show, and very interesting to see the themes of the era it was produced in with the blatant sexism, racism, and other attitudes.  And funny as well.",1452902400,,322,4.129032258064516
2432431,4,B000BOH8YG,"When it first appeared this was a show that broke the mold and has certainly acted as a template to many fine shows that have followed it. But there are problems - the largest, most glaring is in the character of Mrs. Furillo, played by the creator's wife.  She is one of the most exasperating character I can remember.  It is a case of the creator wanting his wife out of the house and on the job.  Not one episode goes by that she isn't barging into the police station blue in the face - my God the woman can't wipe her a@@ without asking Frank about it.  Esterhaus' circumlocutions and Latinisms are difficult to credit to anyone, not even Lionel Trilling let alone a cop calling roll call.  Too, Daniel Travanti's Furillo is rather one dimensional, not nearly as interesting as Belker or Hunter.  I wind up fast-forwarding through a good part of the shows.  The good is very good but the bad is very dated and silly.  Sorry Hill Street Diehards.",1451433600,,949,4.445086705202312

2432433,4,B000BOH8YG,"These series are truly enjoyable. Very well written indeed. The only problem I have is that the quality of the image is good but not excellent. Other problem is the spanish audio. In some episodes is missing, in others is pretty lousy, in other is Ok. For a great series like these the remaster work is unnacceptable.",1449446400,,317,4.578947368421052
2432434,5,B000BOH8YG,I enjoyed this series when it was on years ago.  I enjoyed it all over again when I watched it now.  My son even sat down with me to watch some of the episodes.  To remember how different things were back then is fun and entertaining.,1443139200,,234,4.043478260869565

2432436,4,B000BOH8YG,"The video quality is excellent. I run them on an up-converting Samsung DVD / Blu-ray player. What I don't like are the double sided discs, and for this I took off one star. The series is not cheap, but double sided discs shout cheap. Without artwork they don't have a finished look. For the extra 5 cents it would cost per disc, they should have made an attractive disc set, or at least an attempt at one. I wanted to order the complete series, but a reviewer complained about the video quality. I don't know if it's the up-converting or just my player, but the video is excellent so far. Like most of the DVDs in my collection they look High Def to me. Rarely though, I do get DVDs with disappointing quality, but those are few. If you have a decent DVD player, and you like this series, as I do, then I would order the complete series. Now, I will have to order mine by individual seasons.",1437609600,,891,4.27810650887574

2432443,5,B000BOH8YG,"To those of us that were around to see this series when it
first aired on TV, it hit us differently, than people that are
watching it today.
The reason for that is, we were living it at the time.
We wore the same clothes, drove the same cars, and were
right in the middle of the same issues, that each episode
showed.
Hill Street Blues, set the standard for TV Police shows that
followed it.
Yes, it was at time a bit goofy, but what show does not have
a level of humor in it, to go along with all the serious situations?
China Beach? ER? Third Watch? M*A*S*H? Bay Watch? NCIS?
Magnum PI?......ect ect.
I do find it interesting though, like Barney Miller, Hill Street Blues,
dealt with the exact same issues, back then, that we are still dealing
with in today's times.

It's not a totally realistic view of police departments, but it wasn't supposed to be.  Bochco and Kozoll wrote it with the intent of making the power that be NEVER ask them to write another cop show again.  Instead it turned out to make their careers with whacky cops who did whacky things. They introduced the television world to a huge cast of ensemble actors with multiple sub-plots that ran through episodes.  Music by Mike Post was outstanding (someone here mentioned the abbreviated ending, which I feel was the original ending as it ends on 4 while starting in the second season Post did a resolve that ended on two and rang out, also the phrase in season one completes the title Hill Street Blues if you sing it over the notes.) and featured Larry Carlton on guitar.",1413849600,,878,4.56687898089172

2432503,5,B000BOH8YG,"Back in 1981 TV Shows still ran to twenty-some episodes a season, the audio was in mono, even if the picture was in colour. Hill Street Blues survived and ran for seven seasons because a TV Executive liked it and needed a one-hour show to fill his schedule and ran with it despite rock bottom ratings. Ground-breaking in the portrayal of real-life human beings who happened to be cops rather than bodies who wore uniforms, performed chase scenes and caught bad guys. The show has a large ensemble cast all of whom are fully developed characters. They have lives outside their work as police officers and they perform their duties despite their weaknesses and conflicts on and off the job. The people they deal with live in a disadvantaged neighbourhood and are not portrayed in black and white terms but as human beings faced with difficult circumstances who make bad choices. The actors were given latitude to improvise beyond the lines they were given and the opportunity to influence the arc of their character's storyline to fit their own personalities. The degree to which this show influenced the way later shows were written, shot, and edited for TV cannot be over-stated.

Alas only 2 seasons of the show have come to DVD to date but after marathon sessions glued to the show I discovered the fifty-minute retrospective on the back of disk 3 which shows surviving members of the cast decades later fondly discussing the show and the characters they portrayed intercut with snippets of the scenes they describe which among other things refreshes our memory so that we can match the mature individuals with the youthful actors on screen. This is a show that demands that its viewers pay attention and digest what they are watching. It is not like so many summer blockbusters that show endless actions sequences strung together by a weak plot; here the violence hits home because we get to see how it affects the people involved. Real men do break down and cry. It fully deserves the 10 out of 10 ratings it almost universally receives today.",1367971200,,2047,4.798866855524079

2432511,4,B000BOH8YG,"I loved this show when it was first on and have seen Season 1 and now watching Season 2 again. It still is amazing and tough and gritty and truly groundbreaking for its time. The characters were for the most part real, developed characters who were shown to be the flawed, human people they were, who loved and hated their jobs, their lives, each other, themselves.

I just love Frank Furillo. He was a good man who had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and I am surprised he was able to function in any way with that weight, dealing with bureaucracy, politics, trying to maintain his force of completely different personalities, with their flaws and weaknesses, an ex wife who exhibited the behavior of a psychotic three year old, who stood in the middle of the squad room and screamed how much she hated him, and of course the never ending criminal activity, sometimes also by members of his own squad, as well as trying to be a good father, and also maintain his relationship with Joyce, with having his 24/7 job. I hated the scenes with Faye, who refused to grow up and take responsibility for anything, but only was a shrieking harpy. It got wearying with Joyce complaining about his hours too. His job was what it was, he was the chief of police, and his day was never over. It seems as though the people around him should have become accustomed to that.

 The gang summits also just make me furious, these soulless people who break all laws like they take breath,including murder, sitting in the police station discussing what they will or won't do, and feeling completely untouchable by the enforcers of the law. The scenes in Season 1 where the officers thought the station house was under attack by the gangs was truly chilling, as they knew they were outnumbered, outgunned and by, as I said, soulless, cretinous monsters. Their fear was palpable.

 I tired also of the black = victim, white = evil mentality that was present in every single scene of racial disagreement, scuffle, crime. No one will ever succeed if they don't take responsibility for their own actions and choices, including criminal behavior, and eternally blaming other people for them is codswallop.

There were definite flaws to the show, aspects that seem mindboggling now that anyone would think they were acceptable or funny. One was the character of Esterhaus, a seemingly kindly, gentle older man, who seemed to be some sort of sexual addict, and for the whole first season was sexually involved with and even nearly married a high school girl. He would talk about her being in the marching band, maintaining good grades and talking about her prom dress as though he was a father, and then speak of their sexual relationship. What about this doesn't scream pedophile, and every kind of inappropriate, if not criminal?
Renko, also not a young man, in later seasons also was having a relationship with Daryl Ann, I remember, who was also in her teens.

The first season had a show in which a mother is threatening her daughter with a knife. Hill and Renko investigate to find a woman threatening to kill the girl, who looked about 12, because her husband, the girl's stepfather, was having sex with the girl. The man confessed, saying the girl wore skimpy clothes and the woman didn't ""give him enough."" Hill ""handled"" everything by telling the girl to stop doing that, and the woman to ""pay more attention"" to her husband. No one was arrested, nor was there even any mention of crimes committed, more just a domestic squabble.

Joe, Lucy's partner, spent his time trying to ""protect"" Lucy from dangerous situations, telling her to take cover, because he ""had it bad"" for her and wanted to have sex with her. Every conversation between them had to do with how he was going to have his way with her. I am sorry that Betty Thomas felt that she just had to take the constant harassment and diminishment of her character as a skilled law officer. It's not a compliment to be seen only as a object for sex, not a real, professional human being.

I thought Howard and LaRue were detriments to the police force. LaRue was just a drunk, weak screwup, but Howard was downright scary. Belker rocks! I think the portrayal of his character was actually the most interesting and nuanced, since he wasn't only the growling, scruffy, hardass he looked like, and often showed other emotional layers, more so than the others at times. Hunter was a one note mercenary, Frank was too ""good,"" and never let Faye have it, which he really really should have, etc. But speaking of letting other emotional layers show, the scenes between Hill and Renko after their Season 1 shooting, were gripping and very real.

There were definite flaws starting out, but this was such a good show, and the depth of talent really impressive. I so wish the seasons after 2 were also available.",1355788800,,4847,4.691764705882353

2432517,4,B000BOH8YG,"I loved this show when it first came out in the early 1980's.

It was the first realistic TV police drama and it was a revolutionary, trend stetting and ground breaking style of show for its time. Among other things, it was the first TV police drama to feature hand held cameras moving through the sets.
In the first season, the show only achieved low ratings but wound up winning an Emmy for its first season.

Later shows like NYPD Blue and Law & Order all owe a large debt to Hill Street Blues.

Unfortunately Hill Street Blues seems a bit dated now but it's still worth having on DVD.

Only seasons 1 and 2 of Hill Street Blues seem to be currently available on DVD. That's too bad since the 3rd and 4th seasons with Dennis Franz joining the cast as Lt. Buntz were really good as well. Note to whoever currently owns the copyrights to Hill Street Blues: you may want to consider releasing the later seasons on DVD as well.

The second season of Hill Street (also available on DVD) is better than season 1. The writers seemed to have improved with time and the actors playing the main characters appear to have become noticeably more comfortable with their roles by the second season.

Nonetheless, both Season 1 and Season 2 of Hill Street are worth having on DVD.

This was a ground-breaking TV series. If you're a fan of TV cop shows and/or of TV history, Hill Street Blues is a show you should take a look at.",1348444800,,1416,4.3816793893129775

2432520,5,B000BOH8YG,"Everybody loves Hill Street Blues.

Contrary to the general take on this series, it isn't very ""realistic"". It deals with realistic scenarios... to a degree but like just about everything on TV in the last 30 years, it tries to influence our perspectives of certain social issues, namely race relations.

Everybody plays his stereotypical role. The main black cop is upset about the condition of ""his people"". His white partner is tired of hearing the excuses. The leader of what we now call the SWAT team is racist. This ones a chauvenist, that's one's a homophobe and the other one is an alcoholic. You know the drill. Always nice to see the beautiful Veronica Hammell in nothing but Capt. Furillo's loosely buttoned shirt though... and that thing she does with her tongue....

Nevertheless, the show is excellent. All the actors do great jobs and by the time you see the end credits you're satisfied that you've seen a worthwhile, if not a tad bit corny television show that doesn't exist only to see how far they can push the boundaries of nudity, sex and profanity (cough... NYPD Blue... cough) and call it ""a gritty, portrayal of life on the street"" or whatever nonsense they use to justify the lack of creativity.

My only gripe with this set is that the pilot show has been cut down to one hour for some reason. If you buy the shows individually, the pilot is two hours and I think it even says in the description that the pilot is two hours in the box set but it isn't. It's only one hour long.

Good stuff. Certainly better than any cop drama made after this one stopped airing but don't go into it thinking that's it's some deadly serious portrayal of police work because it isn't. It has it's moments but it's just good all-around TV done the way it used to be - the way it ought to be.",1344470400,,1798,4.5030674846625764
2432521,4,B000BOH8YG,"I don't know if I ever watched a complete episode of Hill Street Blues when it was on TV back in the day, and if I did I don't remember. I picked up HSB Season 1 at Walmart for $10. Really how can you go wrong spending only ten bucks for a complete series of a tv show? I was initially disappointed in the double sided discs but other than a few slow down frames in just one episode the discs played just fine. I find it a bit annoying to read how some can't find the ""missing episodes"" which are merely on the flip side of the DVD. I guess those people must be new to double sided DVDS.

As for the TV show I basically enjoyed the series. At first though I thought the show was pretty dumb. The Bruce Weitz/Det. Belker character was a bit on the stoooopid side at first. Later on though the character seemed to move on from a cliched character to a more believable one. I think the characters of Frank Furillo and Joyce Davenport though got to be the most tedious to me. I grew tired of their being above the fray, of their being smarter and less emotional than everyone else. Their relationship was one long BORE to this viewer. I admit that Veronica Hamel/Davenport was one fine looking woman back in the day but her character made her seem to be such a---- starts with a B and ends with an H. So for all that Super Fox was worth I preferred the more approachable characters. This is not to say I enjoyed Betty Thomas as Lucille Bates instead of Veronica Hamel. I appreciated Lucille Bates' feelings of insecurity due to her six foot one inch stature. She is a big woman, even in real life. It's not like Betty Thomas could be a small woman in real life. So one has to think that Thomas was able to pull from some real life insecurity and pain.

I guess the show for me was the partnerships of Renko and Hill and Washington and Larue. Watching those four characters made me think of Starsky and Hutch. However I have to say that the Renko character was simply weird and the character came off as some sort of gay man, in my opinion of course. I just found his mannerisms to be effeminate, not that there aren't people like that. Hill was rock solid though as a character, as he was supposed to be also. Detective Larue really stole the show at the end of Season 1, and how sad to know that the man also suffered in real life as an alcoholic. And then Larue/Kiel Martin would die young in real life of lung cancer. I think the man had cancer. And finally the other character who was much beloved was the Phil Esterhaus/Michael Conrad character. All through season one though I felt his character was also much of a cliche, as Esterhaus spoke out his carefully crafted roll call speeches. Truly Esterhaus was supposed to be the wise old police Sgt. I also didn't care for his inappropriate relationship with a high school senior girl. Really, there is enough of that B.S. in real life without the show seemingly giving it a moral pass. I was glad when Esterhaus left the girl at the alter. The relationship with Grace was more entertaining, even though I didn't care for the Grace character. I just don't enjoy that actress. She seems so pretentious and fake. And it was also sad to read how Michael Conrad/Esterhaus would die in 1984. He seemed to be a kind soul. Of course he might have been a mean jackass in real life but how would I know. Also, I enjoyed seeing a very young Mimi Rodgers in season 1 as Mrs Pauley. Also, what a trip it was to recognize David Caruso as an Irish Gang Member. Wow, he looked like a cartoon character.

In closing, I couldn't believe how old this show was when I looked it up on Amazon.com. 1981 is the year I graduated from high school so this TV show dates me as well. The police cars look so OLD now. I also wondered where this city was. Where was Hill Street? I decided the community of Hill Street must be near Washington DC since the president of the US was going to visit the area, but then that never happened. In closing though I watched this series in about two to three days. It was fairly easy to watch. I think a lot of the series is dated and every episode bored me to some extent. Also, before I forget I didn't really care for the character of Lt Calletano. He just didn't do anything for me. And he died the same year that Kiel Martin died of lung cancer.

All in all this is decent TV entertainment for the price. I hope the rest of the show comes out on DVD because I don't buy Instant Video stuff that Amazon sells. I like to own copies of what I watch so I can watch it again sometime. I don't even know how the Amazon stuff works.",1344124800,,4588,4.2340182648401825

The show was well put together with some of the best actors during that era. I enjoyed watching the program--but what made it so good was the music of Mike Post who created tunes for many shows during shows of the 80's. Hill Street Blues was not only dramatized it had a lot of comedy in between to keep the viewers intrigued to keep watching to see what was going to jump off next. Every scene got better in between commercials. I love this show and plan to order all seasons in due time. Thanks to Amazon for always keeping a well stocked library of old television series.

Who can ever forget how amazing Daniel J. Travanti and Micheal Conrad (a very sad loss when he passed away) were,as was the entire cast and who can ever forget that memorable phrase ""lets be careful out there""!
I believe that Hill Street Blues was the template for future cop shows in the way it depicted with graphic realism the day to day activities of the magnificent men and women in blue as well as the detectives lifes as well.
They were not afraid to show the police personnel as people with real day to day problems including alcoholism,marital problems and having thoughts of suicide.

2432541,5,B000BOH8YG,"""Hill Street Blues"" (HSB) was a successful American TV series during the 1980's. It seems only three seasons have been released on DVD. This is the first one. The series is set in an anonymous American city, where a group of police officers fight a never ending battle with street gangs, common criminals and corruption in their own ranks. Above all, they fight with themselves and their personal problems. Characters include police chief Frank Furillo, his rival and lover Joyce Davenport, officers Goldblume, Renko and Washington, and the undercover agent Belker. The series became an international success, but seems to be almost forgotten today.

HSB was aired on Swedish television during my high school years. I only remember bits and pieces of it, mostly the weird parts (remember the transvestite who becomes a judge?). Most of all, I remember the reactions of other people to the series.

My grandmother considered it a comic show, and laughed at all episodes, including the serious ones. She even called the series ""The Comedy"". My father nicknamed Goldblume ""Daniel Ortega"" after the then-president of Nicaragua. I mean, the similarity is striking. My buddies at school loved and often imitated Belker, and there was even a kind of hat known as ""the Belker hat"". And, of course, many people have used the expression ""Hey, hey, let's be careful out there"", used by one of the characters in the show.

Personally, I hated HSB until I took a clue from my grandma, learning to watch it as a comedy. Indeed, it *does* contain a lot of funny situations and twists: the tough and perfect Frank Furillo turns out to be member of the AA, Belker goes undercover as a chicken, Captain Freedom does a parody of Rambo, and the gang leader Jesus Martinez becomes a lawyer. Did I mention the transvestite judge? There are also characters that are involuntarily comic, such as the SWAT commander Hunter (who reminds me of Donald Duck). Overall, however, I think HSB is pretty depressive and claustrophobic. You do get the feeling that crime, corruption and personal problems will never cease. Don't watch this if you're into positive thinking!

Once again, this DVD only contains the first season. Many of the situations I described above are probably from later seasons. I just couldn't help myself reviewing the whole series. It's very difficult to rate ""Hill Street Blues"", but for old times sake, I'll give it five stars...

And hey, let's be careful out there! ;-)",1267056000,,2464,4.942028985507246

2432543,5,B000BOH8YG,"I remember that I was about 6 or seven when this was airing on TV. Being a cop now in my thirties, I love this show. TV today is overly complicated, with shallow characters and just poor writing, usually lacking the humanity and mortality of real life. This show has everything modern television lacks. If you haven't seen this series, your missing out. Definitely set the model for other great shows like Homicide: Life on the Streets.

2432544,4,B000BOH8YG,"One of the stark realities of Season 1 that I find so amazing is how the characters were fully realized at the outset.  They just simply 'show up' mulit-layered and have depth (the exception being Sgt {later LT.} Hunter, but even that character takes on facets as the season goes on).  As the season progresses, this depth just grows and as the characters continue to round out, the camera captures as much of the shadow as it does the light.  Ground breaking in that it was first to show on a regular basis the consequences of carrying a badge and gun--taking lives and putting lives on the line--right from the pilot and continuing on into the rest of the season.

Great show which is now, even more than then, a guilty pleasure.",1247529600,,731,4.515151515151516
2432545,5,B000BOH8YG,"Hill Street Blues (HSB) was the original police drama before every other show that has come along since.  NYPD Blue, the Law & Order franchise, etc. are all because of this show.  HSB set the bar high showing the trials and tribulations of the beat cops, detectives and their shift supervisor Capt. Furillo at the Hill Street Precinct in the big city (production crew went to great lengths to not specify a city).  This isn't CHiPs, or Starsky & Hutch either.

HSB is a bit gritty, and the pilot episode is a realistic reflection of law enforcement compared to many other shows that just show the detective with classic good looks getting the bad guys and (possibly) the girl.  The show gets right into the thick of things quick.  HSB focuses on the daily problems and conflicts of beat cops and the residents of the precinct that they protect and serve.  Along with drama, you do get some comic relief with the characters and events around the station, but not too much to cheapen the entire act with an absurd act or two.

I'm only 22, so I didn't see Hill Street when it was brand spankin' new.  I saw a few bits on youtube after my parents told me about the show.  After one free iTunes episode download, I had to have the whole season.  HSB is the source of real TV police drama and where it all began.  Season 1 is only the tip of the iceberg to many other great episodes.",1245110400,,1378,4.381889763779528

2432571,5,B000BOH8YG,"What a great trip back to what I consider one of the best television series ever filmed. I actually didn't start watching Hill Street Blues until midway through season 2, so other than catching a couple of the episodes from Season 1 in reruns these shows were mostly new to me. Writers Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll created some of the most original characters ever seen on TV up to that point. Although the show was never a ratings smash it achieved cult status with its extremely loyal fan base and earned 98 Emmy Award Nominations during its seven year run.

The Season One set has all 17 episodes, including the award-winning pilot ""Hill Street Station"". It is interesting to note, three actors who became major characters in the show, Michael Warren (Hill), Charles Haid (Renko), and Ed Marinaro (Coffey) were all originally scripted to be killed during this season. Hill & Renko in the pilot, and Coffey in episode 17. In fact, Coffey WAS killed in the original airing of the show but was such a hit that the producers decided to remake the final scene for reruns, referring to him as wounded.

Also included is an hour-long reunion show with many of the stars, including Michael Warren, Charles Haid, Barbara Bosson, Veronica Hamel, and Bruce Weitz. It's a blast watching them reminisce about the show and how much they enjoyed it.

I would highly recommend this to fans of television police shows. This was such an original show many shows have tried to copy. Without Hill Street Blues there would have been no NYPD Blue.",1228867200,,1532,4.730337078651686
2432572,5,B000BOH8YG,"There was a time in the 1980s when the best hour of television was on Thursdays at 10:00 when Hill Street Blues came on.  At the time, I was a dedicated fan, and though I'd caught the show occasionally in syndication, it'd been years since I'd really seen the show.  Rewatching the first season of this show reminded me that even two decades later, this remains a quality show.

Prior to Hill Street Blues, cop shows tended to focus almost entirely on the mystery of the week.  Characters rarely changed from week to week, so you could watch the episodes in almost any order.  The personal lives of the characters was completely secondary, often just enough to give them a bit of dimension.  Hill Street Blues changed that.

Unlike most cop shows, Hill Street Blues really was an ensemble show, taking place in the Hill Street Precinct of an unnamed but generally run-down city.  The central character is Captain Frank Furillo, who is as much a bureaucrat as a cop; while generally a good guy, he knows when rules need to be bent or broken, but there are certain lines he won't cross.  There are street cops, most notably Officers Hill and Renko who bicker like a married couple and detectives like LaRue and Washington, the former being an alcoholic who is always on the brink of self-destruction.  A favorite of many is Mick Belker, a grungy diminutive detective whose bite is as bad as his bark, yet he always has time to talk to his mother.

Some cop characters start off as stereotypes, but eventually develop some depth. Howard Hunter starts off as the semi-fascist leader of the EAT (essentially a SWAT team) and Henry Goldblume is Hunter's bleeding-heart liberal contrast.  Goldblume evolves in this season, but Hunter will take several seasons to really seem human.

It is amazing that in this era when story arcs can often takes many episodes if not entire seasons, that there was concern when certain Hill Street Blues stories took three or four episodes to resolve; could the audience handle it?  Apparently so.  In fact, though some parts of this show are dated (the first season is 28 years old, after all), overall Hill Street Blues holds up well.  With both humor and gravity, this is an excellent show.  If you enjoy today's crime dramas (CSI, Numbers, Cold Case, etc.), check out the show that really kicked off the modern version of the genre.",1222560000,3,2362,4.708029197080292

2432576,5,B000BOH8YG,"Although I was born in 1980 and therefore never able to watch Hill Street Blues when it originally aired, I am completely enthralled by the fantastic storylines, characters, and atmosphere that it creates.  There are very few shows that can establish a direct relationship with the viewer which makes them want to watch the whole season in one sitting, but this show does this without blinking.  All in all, I cannot commend this show enough for its originality, and remember, I am an unfortunate soul who has only been privileged to watch two seasons on dvd (which begins the problem).

The problem I see is threefold.  First, why can't anyone in Hollywood come up with a long-lasting and unique idea that can create the fanbase that Hill Street Blues had?  Where have the writers gone?  Are we as people going to be treated with garbage reality shows and misfit sitcoms for the remainder of our lives?  Second, what is the hold up with the rest of the releases?  As many reviewers have already stated, there are countless (and marketless) TV-DVD releases every week, so why can't Hill Street Blues be one of the series' that people will actually buy?  And finally, as such a fantastic show, shouldn't it get a little better DVD treatment?  I know this is a minor gripe, but I am not a fan of double-sided discs.  I've actually had trouble with both seasons skipping and becoming pixelated to the point that I had to skip over certain episode chapters.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this issue, but I would definitely like to see future releases (Please!) on one-sided discs.

I've now watched both seasons in their entirety three times, the latest being with my girlfriend, born in 1985, who finished them in a matter of weeks.  Needless to say, Hill Street Blues is now in her top five favorite shows.  So please, studio gods, release the remaining seasons and make all of us a little happier, especially those of us who haven't even seen the rest of the series!",1216339200,2,1972,4.658959537572255

If you're looking for a gritty urban cop drama with generous amounts of humour and some location shots then season one of HSB is highly recommended. I'm quite sure fans of shows such as Barney Miller and M*A*S*H, which are comedies first with some great drama, will be well rewarded by viewing HSB.

At the moment I'm reliving season one of NYPD Blue on DVD; another gritty cop drama from Steven Bochco, although this one contains some dizzy camera work and more than its fair share of mandatory butt shots.

His parting warning to his team ""Now let's be careful out there,"" was always the last thing he said to those heading out on patrol at the beginning of every episode.
Was there anyone in Television more stunning than Veronica Hamel ? On screen she was simply mesmorising.
Another item of note about Hill Street - how much class the African American officers displayed, and what wonderful roles were written for them.  Officer Bobby Hill (Michael Warren) who had to deal with his partner, the complaining Renko (Charles Haid) and teach him to grow up, whilst Det Washington (Taurean Blaque) had the lyin' La Rue alias John JD LaRue (Kiel Martin) to constantly cover for, as his partner womanized and drank to excess, and went awol from jobs.
Other characters/actors of note in this series were James B Sikking as Lt Howard Hunter, the military misfit, and Joe Spano as the gentle Henry Goldblume the real right hand man to Furillo.
I love this series as much today as I did back then and agree with those many on here who say the quality of the transfer to DVD and general packaging could have been a lot better.
However, after waiting so long for the series to appear on DVD we will just have to put up with what we're given.

My parents talked about it and I heard it referred to in relation to other shows I like so I decided to see what the hype was about.  For once the hype was right, this is  a really good show.  It can even pull in a first time watcher when it is about 26 years out of date.  The reason this show holds up so well is that the characters are so interesting.  I am currently watching season 2 and hope the rest of the series will be released on DVD so I can get caught up.

2432601,5,B000BOH8YG,"Normally, nostaligia interferes, clouding memory, so returning to an old favorite leaves me with little more than a bad taste in my mouth. 'How could I have liked this?' I often ask myself.

Fortunately, this show is a powerful counter example. It's well-acted by a superb cast. The emphasis is on character actors exploring roles with real dimension to them. The plots are driven primarily by the reasonable frustration of policing the roughest part of a city.

As a side note, this show reminds me of life in the 1980's - not the ""Miami Vice"" version, but the downtrodden Reagan years of high inflation and low wages. It's not a pretty picture, but it's an honest picture. The change in affluence over the past 20 years is really stunning - I'm not talking about the poor, but rather the very middle-class police officers, struggling to make ends meet.

Later police dramas (NYPD Blue in particular, given the connection between the show) followed the same formula, with slightly different twists, more raw language, and partial nudity. Still, Hill Street Blues stands out as an excellent example of what a police drama can be.

However, I fear that this review has so far missed the mark. It's a TV show, and the primary question is, ""Is it entertaining?"". For me, that's a definite ""YES"". I can watch one or two episodes in a sitting, absorbing both the atmosphere and the action, and enjoy myself, looking forward to more. I tend not to buy TV shows, as I can't see watching them, and there are always others to rent, but I'm glad I own this one, and look forward to getting the rest of the seasons.

(As an aside, people often ask where this takes place - it's never spelled out, although there are hints that it's Chicago. However, it could take place reasonably in any large midwestern city.)",1169596800,2,1800,4.6835443037974684
2432602,5,B000BOH8YG,"I miss ""HSB"" so much that I've invented a fantasy scenario, if the show were revived. I'd simply call it ""The New Hill Street Blues"".

Without furher ado, here it is.: Megan Gallagher revives her role as Captain Tina Russo-Torgersen, of Hill Street Precinct, in Police Chief Frank Furillos's former position. Her husband, Assistant FIRE Chief Thor Torgersen, would be played by Lance Henriksen (Megan and Lance's tribute to their ""Millennium"" years)! Their teenage daughter, Hilda, would be played by Brittany Tiplady (another ""Millennium"" tribute).

Andrew Renko would now be the Master Sergeant Watch Commander, doing the morning roll calls done by Sgt. Esterhaus. His roll-call schtick would be telling outrageous anecdotes, to illustrate whatever the number one patrol priority for the day would be. Sometimes he'd even dress in costume to drive home that point. He'd still cutup with . . .

Bobby Hill would now be Lt. Robert Hill, head of dectectives, the same position occupied by Ramon Calletano.

Lt. Lucille Bates would now be in charge of the EATers, once spearheaded by Howard Hunter, and Lt. Joseph Coffey would be in charge of the EATers of a rival precinct. They're secretly married!

Howard Hunter would be CEO and Chairman of the Board of Howard's Hunters, a Corporate Threat Assesment Firm. He also does mercenary work in the Middle-East. Grace Gardner is now Grace Hunter! Yeah, a little international espinonage thrown in. He'd visit the ol' precinct house, clean out his still smoldering pipe in the trash, and start another fire, for old times' sake!!

Chief Furillo's wife, Joyce, now captains her own private law firm. Working with her as a skip-tracer, repo-man, P.I., and bounty hunter, is Michael Belker. A sometimes helper to Mick, would be that poker-faced pickpocket played so masterfully by Nick Savage! Oh, Mick and Deborah Kaplan FINALLY tie the knot. Much later in the show, Joyce's new mystery law partner is retired Rear Admiral Harmon Rabb, USN (Why not have a ""JAG"" crossover?)!

Fletcher Daniels is now the city's mayor, in the middle of a gubernatorial campaign.

Fay still worries her ex-husband, they remain friends, but is now married to a broadcast executive played by Leonard Nimoy. Fay's and Frank's son, Frank Jr., is a HOTSHOT drop-dead handsome rookie cop at Hill Street Precinct. He's played by either Elijah Wood, or Hunter Schlesinger.

Hery Goldblume is an Associate Chief, Frank's right-hand man, head of Frank's Joint Commanders Staff--JCS Commander Henry Goldblume. This outfit would be known on the show as ""King Frank's Knights of the Round Table"".

One of those Commanders would be Cdr. Neil Washington. A few years before, Capt. John D. LaRue would have died a hero's death trying to stop a major bank robbery, with his partner, Neil at his side.

There's been conjecture about this city's location. Could just as well be Cincinatti; Philadelphia; Columbus; Buffalo; Pittsburg, PA; or Baltimore. Boston; Portsmouth, NH; or Bangor, ME, would be stretches, because there wasn't references to old Amereican history in this show.",1168992000,2,3085,5.137724550898204
2432603,5,B000BOH8YG,"I was lucky enough to be able to follow this show from the beginning, and it was truly unlike any police show that had been on TV up to that point. When Hill Street premiered in January 1981, cable had just begun to become available to most homes, and so most cop shows up to that point had been network fare looking for mass appeal that were either overserious ala ""Dragnet"", comical ala ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Car 54"", or just over the top ala ""The Mod Squad"".

Hill Street was completely different. It showed the hopeless poverty of those living in the run-down Hill Street precinct, the shaken rape victims immediately after the crime, the ups and downs of the various partnerships among the officers, and the personal lives of the members of the force. The only brave act Hill Street never performed was actually NAMING the city in which the drama was playing out. With all of the snow, the entrenched bureaucracy, and with neighborhoods with names such as ""Midtown"", I can only imagine this must have been New York City, but for some reason producer Bochco never actually named the location.

The series was one of the first to regularly employ handheld cameras to give the show a fly-on-the-wall, documentary feel, but this technique was not overused. Also, the show pulled no punches on the personal lives of the characters. During the first season LaRue descends from a somewhat slimy charmer to a completely pickled bum, and Hill and Renko's doubts and fears after being gunned down help to humanize roles that up to that time had often been wrapped up in macho posturing.

One of the lighter sides of season one is forty-something Phil Esterhaus trying to decide between his eighteen year old girlfriend Cindy and the fortiesh and erotic Grace Gardner who is trying to make up for lost time at a pace that would probably even seem extreme to Hugh Hefner. Another funny moment is when Esterhaus ends roll call by saying that he has been ordered to inspect the officers for ""unusual weapons."" The cops bring out hunting knives, switchblades, and sawed-off shotguns, throwing them on a table. As Esterhaus continues his announcements, the officers return their brass knuckles and other contraband weapons to their pockets. Comedy sometimes turns to tragedy, though, such as when Belker keeps apprehending a fellow who thinks he is a comic book crimefighter and when asked for his name keeps giving his comic book name. Eventually, though, the caped crimefighter runs across a criminal who doesn't get the joke and he is killed.

The one aspect of Hill Street that never really made sense to me was the couple of Frank Furillo and Joyce Davenport. With Frank overseeing the police officers that tend to the mayhem that is the world of crime-ridden Hill Street, and Joyce as public defender doing her best to free every criminal no matter how guilty, I can't imagine why they would ever want to have anything to do with one another socially, assuming they truly believed in what they were doing on the job.

As a final point, if you haven't seen this show since it first aired 25 years ago, you're going to notice a lot of not-yet stars that were playing guest spots during this first season. These include David Caruso who later starred on Bochco's NYPD Blue, Tim Daly of ""Wings"", Michael Tucker of Bochco's ""L.A. Law"", and a young Danny Glover as a very scary gang member. I highly recommend this first season of Hill Street Blues whether you have seen it before or it is all new to you.",1166486400,6,3502,4.715686274509804
2432604,3,B000BOH8YG,"I started watching this season immediately after finishing the outstanding newest season of ""The Shield,"" so the bar was set unusually high for this series, so I really don't hold it against the first season of ""Hill Street Blues"" for walking right into it. It quite frankly seemed to be moving in slow motion compared to ""The Shield.""  And for all the complaints we have to listen to about us being an ADD culture, that show is better off for it's reluctance to spend time with the mundane. But more important than the speed is the intelligence. ""Hill Street Blues"" tell you what to think about right and wrong. Their theme music screams ""We're the good guys!"" and from then on that statement is never so much as looked at, much less challenged. ""The Shield"" challenges you to figure out who the good guys are, and why.

Despite all that ""Hill Street Blues"" puts out a decent effort in its first season. We follow Captain Frank Furillo and his quirky, flawed staff of cops around an unnamed city. They come up against gangs, corrupt cops, and neglectful mothers. They even try to open a saloondramat (a what?). The main problem is I simply cannot go back in time and watch this show in its original time slot. Remember, back in 1981 we were emerging from a decade that saw ""Starsky and Hutch"" as the typical TV cop show. Still, the amount of violence and sexuality I found was, while tame by today's standards, more than I expected. I was also quite pleased with the character development of Furillo. He truly is a case study in healthy management skills. He's tough when need be, but accomplishes most of his tasks through logic and understanding. His character is beautiful counterpoint to the megalomaniac, tough for the sake of looking tough Glen Haskins from ""Glory Road."" The season finale delivered some surprises, as season finales typically do. One you can see coming from a country mile away, the other hits you like a cold slap to the face . . . well, make that a warm slap. A major complaint I would have is the shows habit of leaving plot threads hanging. One that leaps to mind involves Phil leaving his wife to marry an 18 year old because of her fertility (hey man, whatever he says). Despite the fact that said marriage ends in disaster, his love life is never mentioned again. Does he get back together with his wife? And I really don't give two toots what the writers of this show think, his wife cannot compete, looks wise, with an 18 year old. Any 18 year old. Period.

So do I recommend this season? Yes, but barely. It should really only be viewed as supplementary to modern shows like ""24,"" ""The Wire,"" and of course ""The Shield."" This show is more of a relic. A quaint piece of TV history where police corruption is treated as the exception not the rule, and morals matter more than politics. I'm sure back in 1981 the show would've looked awesome, but time has not been kind. But I still respect it because now it has been reincarnated into some of the best shows on TV. Besides sometimes you just need a break from all the torture and high tech gadgets that is in those other shows. 6.64 out of 10",1156550400,5,3125,4.507936507936508
2432605,3,B000BOH8YG,"I can remember in High-school being acquaintances with a fellow named Jeff Swan, who's advice to me, when signing my yearbook, was:  turn your damn watch around, and don't forget to watch Hill Street Blues.  Well, I still wear my watch turned to the inside, but I didn't forget his second piece of sage advice.

Hill Street Blues was one of my favorite shows in the early 80's.  I loved it!  Its funny, because I remember it being ""so violent"" and exciting.  Really a great show!

Well, I watched this DVD set, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  It didn't live up to my memories of the show.  In fact, I can say I was a bit disappointed.

I will give it 4 stars, as it is a well written show, and has some good plotlines.  But overall, not my favorite DVD set.

I loved it so much that I carried a portable TV with me in the car (ran off the cigarette lighter) to be able to catch each episode up until it's finish because I had to be in work at the hospital at 11:00p.m., which was when HSB finished for the evening. Also because I was such a fanatic for the show, I made little notes in a pad about dialogue snippets, plot elements, etc.

Time passed and because I never saw the show in reruns, I mostly forgot about it, except for a vague memory that I loved it dearly.

Then Season One comes out on DVD and my love affair starts all over again!!! I've seen very few dramas that combine such superb writing, acting and editing skills as HSB. The characters are immortal and stay with you long after. If you're a fan from the original broadcast run like I was, you'll have a great time having your memory rejogged by all the teriffic supporting characters and situations from the first time you saw them.

Now, 25 years later, this set fell into my lap and I am happy to say that I finally understand what all the fuss was about.  The one thing that strikes me is that when the end credits roll after each episode, I always look up at the clock because I can't believe it's over already.

2432622,5,B000BOH8YG,"Like so many of you who have written reviews, I too have waited nearly 20 years for this release.  I was 12 when I first got hooked on HSB and I have to admit that I was worried that it would not live up to all the praise I have heaped upon it over the years.  Boy, was I surprised -- the show is even better than I remember!  Of course, it helps that I now understand some of the jokes and innuendo that went over my head then.

The characters, the writing, the direction and the actors are all superb.  Dan Travanti is still so compelling as the moral center of the show -- Frank Furillo's humility and humanity are so real that you cannot help but be drawn into the never-ending saga of the Hill Street precinct.  Of course, his scenes with Veronica Hamel are shockingly steamy given that this was filmed in the early '80s.  It is hard to believe that some of this stuff got past censors -- but thank God for Bochco -- he must have given them some headaches.  Joyce Davenport was my hero -- such a strong female character, who obviously had good looks but did not rely upon them for her success.  The seven-year development and evolution of the love story between Furillo and Davenport makes the relationship one that continues to resound today.

I could go on and on about all the characters that you will come to love if you watch this dvd -- Esterhaus, Hill and Renko (can you say those names separately?), LaRue and Washington, Bates and Coffey, Belker, and the others.  The incredible writing and depth of these characters puts every show that is currently on television to shame.  But they all owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to this ground-breaking show.  When the West Wing won its fourth emmy and was being compared to Hill Street Blues, the producers of the West Wing didn't want anyone to make that comparison because the West Wing, as good as it is, is no Hill Street Blues.

As for the DVD, I too wish that Fox had made more of an effort in the production -- more commentary, liner notes and extras would be great.  I hope for more as they release future seasons.  Previously unseen footage or interviews would be great.

All in all -- this is 5 stars.  If you somehow missed this in its first run, or were too young to watch -- give yourself a gift.  You will watch the pilot and honestly, you will never be the same.

However Fox should hang their heads in shame as to how shoddy this release is, firstly it's double sided DVD's which I can understand on some product that they're sure is going to sell low figures but HSB is one of the most requested DVD releases there is. So releasing double sided DVD's just seems to be a way for Fox to make as much profit as they can

Secondly the picture quality is pretty awful, was HSB recorded onto Video rather than film ? it certainly looks that way and Fox have spared every expense in-order to bring a cleaned up picture.

Hopefully this is just a result of the series having such an underwhelming debut and that as the series gained more popularity later episodes moved to better quality stock and the picture does improve

2432649,5,B000BOH8YG,"I have just spent the better part of the evening watching the first five episodes of this series. I was laughing, crying, and in shock... just as I was 25 years ago. When the first episode aired on NBC, I was 12 years old and in junior high. I still remember my parents and I sitting in front of the television, wondering what in the world we had just seen, it was so different. It was also so compelling that we tuned in to the next episode, trying to figure out what we'd seen that first night.

Frankly, I stumbled across this DVD set in the video store and decided to splurge. Boy, am I EVER glad that I did! As many of the reviews I have read here have said, they haven't made a show like this since. ""Hill Street Blues"" broke new ground in television, and reached a summit that other series have not come close to (despite their emulating Hill Street's style). As has also been mentioned, most of these characters were almost-fully formed from the start (and those that weren't grew into it as the series went on). They had flaws that would sometimes crop up, disappear, and crop up again. They were real people with real problems (Faye Furrillo not fully accepting her divorce from Frank, the drinking problems of both Frank Furrillo and J. D. LaRue, juggling relationships with police life, etc) and real desires (the passions of Phil Esterhaus and Grace Gardner, the secret relationship between Furillo and Joyce Davenport, Henry Goldblum's somewhat overly-optimistic outloook on life, etc). This series, to me, epiotmizes how drama really isn't good drama unless you have it butting against the occasional comedic moment, and then sometimes going right into a tragedy. This show captured life without being a ""reality"" show, and it gave the audience at least several cast members they could relate to. This DVD set brings it all back, and true to form (plus, you don't have all those annoying commercials).

I also greatly enjoyed the reunion segment with most of the still-living cast members. Having them look back and talk about things I had just watched was incredible. My disappointments in that segment -- Danny Travanti and Betty Thomas weren't there, and I would have liked to hear a few more comments about the cast members no longer living (Micheal Conrad, Kiel Martin and Rene Enriquez). Except for that it was a GREAT thing to watch.

One other disappointment, one that someone else mentioned -- the lack of really good liner notes. 20th Centruy Fox Home Video, please make a note -- for the other six seassons, put in better liner notes!

If you saw this series on TV, either originally or in reruns, you'll love this DVD set. If you've never seen the show at all (and it's getting harder to find the show anywhere on television), rent / buy this DVD set and see the style of television that so many shows since (including the ""CSI"" series, ""Homicide"" and ""NYPD Blue"") have tried to imitate but not really come close to. Not only did ""Hill Street Blues"" break new ground, it scaled the mountain to heights that many shows before and since have only dreamt of reaching.

Reading over this, I remember an NBC ad that aired near the end of the last season. It was a montage of chalk-drawing animations of various scenes and characters from the series. There was no music (not even the still highly-identifiable-today theme song by Mike Post), just these (rather prophetic) spoken words:

""Face it, America... you'll never be over the Hill.""

And there's only one way to close this... the signature end-of-roll-call admonition by Sgt. Phillip Freemason Esterhaus (and used once, with dramatic effect, much later in the series by Sgt. Stan Jablonski):

""And HEY! Let's be careful out there""",1141084800,2,3708,4.737984496124031

More info on the show in the way of some liner notes would have been welcome.

It was annoying that the disc didn't label the 'present day roll call' segment, so you had to look through all the sides of the disc to find it. (It's on Disc Three, for those yet to buy it.) I've noticed this on other discs, too, and it's puzzling.

2432654,5,B000BOH8YG,"It's been a long wait.  19 years to be exact, and it's been a long 19 years!

I've recently been working my way through all the Sopranos box sets.  The Sopranos is a good show.  Like HSB it's a drama come soap opera.  But HSB is in a different league to The Sopranos.  Much is said about how revolutionary HSB was at the time.  But the sad truth is that it is still revolutionary today.  Other shows have may have borrowed from it's formula, but they have all without exception diluted the mix.

For example:

1) Characters.  I cannot think of any other show with as many characters as HSB.  And what is interesting is that these characters appear almost fully formed from the get go.  And each and every character is a complex fully formed person. Contrast this with the Sopranos where Pauli and Silvio have yet to have a single storyline devoted devoted to either of them in the first 4 series...  The Sopranos, NYPD Blue etc all spend far to long dwelling on a core group of characters.  In HSB the action would dart about a lot more.

2) Storylines.  HSB would always run several storylines of varying lengths and complexities concurrently.  They would each have different themes such as compassion, humour, tragidy, love interest, whatever.  Characters would be seemlessly threaded in and out of these storylines, with one new stroy line being created, and one existing storyline being resolved each epiosde.  There would also be a minor very short story line that started and concluded within the each episode, enabling it to stand alone.  NYPD Blue failed to do this to the same extent.  The reason being the lack of characters to play with.  NYPD Blue worked to a far less chaotic pattern, with everything being much more formulaic and predictable.  I cannot think of any other show with the same depth of plotting as HSB.  In contrast very little happens in an entire season of the Sopranos.

3) Character terminations.  With a lot of characters to lay with, HSB was never scared to kill a few off.  Sometimes more than one at a time, and usually with little or no warning.

4) Humour.  The humour in HSB was much more sophisticated and complex than in any other show.  There was humour than only the audience was privvy to, humour that was exchanged between the characters, and also practical jokes.  Only the best sitcoms show humour on all these levels.  But with HSB there is no canned laughter, the humour doesn't feel like it's been written by a writer.  It's realistic.  And every episode would contain humour, and sadness in different plot threads.

5) Long running and resurfacing plot threads.  Many other shows will introduce a certain character trait or plot thread purely to run a particular story.  With HSB it was the other way round.  If a character had a flaw, then this would resurface over and over again.  And plot threads would suddenly be raked over, and temp ressurected months later.

6) No stars.  HSB was pretty much a level playing field.  Only Furrillo got slightly more screen time than the other characters.

7) Action at all levels.  HSBs encompassed characters at all levels withing the police precinct.  Everything from the janitor to the captian.  And all their lives are seen as equally important as far as the plots went.

8) It felt real.  It was like watching a really exciting and interesting documentary.  You felt absorbed into the show.  It didn't ever seem contrived.  No other show has achieved this fine balance, let along maintained it for 7 seasons.

9) It never got stale.  The last episode was as good as the first.

10) It's a slice of time.  It's pre-mobile phone, pre-internet, pre-AIDS, pre-9/11, 1980s.",1139097600,12,3665,4.703001579778831

2432660,5,B000BOH8YG,"Hill Street Blues started out as twice-a-week (Thursdays and Saturdays!) mid-season filler for perennial loser NBC before the network decided to stay with it while it built an audience!

The 17-episode first season was some of the grittiest drama even seen on the small screen, as we got to know the regulars of Hill Street Station (yeah!, I know it's thought to be set in Chicago but putting together pieces of Officer ""Cowboy"" Andy Renko's dialogue, a case can be made for West Patterson, New Jersey) and characters (one timers and recurring) came and went on both sides of the law. For reasons best known to Producer Steven Bochco, that ""gritty look and feel of the first season fell by the wayside in the six subsequent seasons as the show became more character-driven.

Before we came to love ace undercover Detective Mick Belker as the devoted son to his unseen parents, a caring and heart-breaking loner, this was clearly a man with major issues which bordered on the carnivorous if not cannibalistic!

And then there was John ""J.D."" LaRue, a train-wreck of a loser in a sluiceway of alcohol and get-rich schemes (I actually thought the ""saloondromat"" idea had promise) who, with Precinct Captain Frank Furillo, provided one of the great lump-in-the-throat TV moments in the first season finale. (""Hi, J.D."")

The first season's Product Details cites ""Episode commentaries,"" but don't identify who... kinda important I'd think since so many of the key actors... Michael Conrad, Ren Enrquez, Kiel Martin, Trinidad Silva... are no longer with us.

But, on the otherside of the coin, now-familiar faces seen in that memorable first season include Steven Bauer, David Caruso (who went the seven season distance as Tommy Mann, gang leader of the Shamrocks), Andy Garcia, Mark Metcalf, Dan Hedaya, Robert DoQui, Lynn Whitfield, Louis Giambalvo, Andrea Marcovicci, Tony Plana, Clayton Rohner, Dolph Sweet, Timothy Daly, Michael Tucker, Mimi Rogers, Charles Hallahan and James Remar.

You could get Beverly Hillbillys, Petticoat Junction, Space 1999, and God knows what other awful television shows now for years, but not this, perhaps the most groundbreaking dramatic series of the past twenty years.  Sure, compared to The Sopranos, The Shield, Deadwood, and earlier, Homicide, and of course, NYPD Blue, this is pretty tame stuff. But put in the context of its time, and given that without it, the shows mentioned above wouldn't exist, the fact that Hill Street Blues may come across as a little dated does not alter one iota its brilliance.  I still remember watching the first episode, the pilot, and my jaw dropping open in the opening, soon to become regular, moment of the show, the roll call, when Sgt. Esterhaus (the great Michael Conrad) asks the assembled morning shift to dispose of unauthorized weapons. And out come an assemblage of guns, knives, brass knuckles, etc., to make any law-and-order believing cop lover cringe.  Two minutes into the series and you knew you weren't in the world of any cop show you'd ever seen before.  You knew you were about to see realism, at least in the television sense of it, taken to places you'd never known. The multi-plots, the gritty documentary visual style, the overlapping dialogue ala Robert Altman, the diverse cast, the characters who were defined by the imperfections, the view of law enforcement as an imperfect system driven by forces like politics, the relationship between the primarily white police and the mostly black and brown people it served, all was fresh and new and startling.  Few network shows, then and now, dared to take the chances this show did.

By the way, speaking about crying, I remember the xmas epsiode where it ends with vignettes of everyone enoying their xmas cheer and finished with Belker, alone in his apt, on the phone with his mother.  I'm getting teary eyed again.",1129334400,6,357,4.819672131147541

8090158,4,B000BOH8YG,"Yes, I am another of a fond majority who just love seeing HILL STREET BLUES again.  I will even admit the show is a bit sillier than I remember, especially Hunter the head of the EATers.(Emergency Action Team).
i remember way back when thinking ""Animal"" Belker was a bit sit com-ish.  All the growling.
But, this show is so easy to watch episode after episode after episode.  My only real complaint is disc 2 episode 2 ""Up In Arms"" I could not see the end as final 10 minutes froze to no more viewing.  And that is the episode actor Mark Metcalf (Animal House AND Twisted Sister video ... snicker snicker ""what r u gonna do with your life...?!!"") and his partner cop ""Santino"" ... well, I will not say any more for you newbies out there.
HILL STREET BLUES truly was ahead of its time its drama and realism so well done complimented by the surprising doses of humor.
Great viewing I am currently purchasing seasons 2 and 3 ... and so on.

the xtra feature has cast reunion (no Travanti or Betty Thomas).  They talk for almost an hour.  Not bad.
two episodes get a very good commentary by Creator Steven Bochco, and actors Joe Spano (Henry Goldblume) and James Sikking (Howard Hunter).
4 stars for my Season 1 HILL STREET BLUES only because of 10 minute picture freeze.  5 star show.",1487721600,,1281,4.444444444444445
