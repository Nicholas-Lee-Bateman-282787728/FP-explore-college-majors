The translation is way off, which somehow gets worse toward the last disc (I assume they're using different translators). For example, ""you"" is used for scenes where ""I"" should be used, incorrect names are mentioned in some scenes, or some sentences don't even make sense in English, etc.
I was very happy to find these DVDs at first because I thought I could watch them with my husband who doesn't speak Japanese but while we were watching the DVDs with the English subtitles on, I had to explain what's going on to my husband as he was often confused due to the incorrect translation.
There would be no issues in watching in Japanese but if you do not speak Japanese at all and have to rely on the English subtitles then I wouldn't recommend.",1437436800,,956,4.531791907514451
8436173,5,B004MOS494,"First of all I received this drama quickly and well packaged.  Secondly, what a cute drama this is.  The animals are adorable with a hint of romantic feelings between the main characters.  I always rooted for Makino and Rui to get together in Hana Yori Dango but it didn't happen, so I was thrilled the actors worked together again in this drama.  I highly recommend it.  Shun Oguri is excellent as usual.",1325030400,,405,4.569444444444445
