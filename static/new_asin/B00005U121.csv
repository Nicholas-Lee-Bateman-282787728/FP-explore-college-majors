7953924,5,B00005U121,This is a great performance by Tony Bennett.  He has lots overy good guests and duets and he talks to may of them so shows off  his terrific personality along with his singing ability.,1377734400,,184,4.382352941176471
7953925,3,B00005U121,"I heard Christmas in Herald Square on the radio. The singing isn't so good. Not sure about the lyrics, but the ""Ho Ho Ho"" bothered me. I'm kind of a Tony Bennett fan, but that's based mostly on recordings from longer ago. Ignore the three stars. I can't really rate the entire CD. I'd give Christmas in Herald Square a 2.",1132704000,,321,4.278688524590164
7953926,4,B00005U121,"its only four stars because i thought the direction was kind of ordinary and the host mark mc ewan(sic?) a little too heavy handed in the M.C. dept. Tony in fine fettle. A rare one for me,"" Christmas in Herold square"",Over the rainbow""and a duet with Elmo from seseme street quite charming. DVD quality could be better but your not buying it for that. But it is not as good as tony in a gin mill being the best that can be after sinatra .This one is good at christmas time, which I beleive was when it was taped at A&E several years ago. good show.",1126828800,,548,4.179245283018868
7953927,5,B00005U121,"This is a great dvd by Tony Bennett. Tony takes request from famous celebrities and sings songs such as steppin out,watch what happens,Chicago,over the rainbow,fly me to the moon and more songs. Tony also does a duet with Elmo. Clint Black performs cold cold heart for Tony and Natalie Cole another one of my favorite singers performs smile. The video quality of the dvd is sharp and clean. The colors are very brillent. Dvd bonus features include song access via chapter search,interactive menus,Tony Bennett photo archive and websites. The disc offers two audio choices. You can choose between pcm stereo or 5.1 surround sound. The 5.1 makes it sound like it surrounds you if you have a tv with surround sound speakers. This dvd makes it seem like Tony's performing for you. If you like Tony Bennett you must get this disc. I hope sony video will release his first live by request Valentines special on dvd in the near future. This was his second one recorded in December 1996.",1019606400,18,979,4.764705882352941
