I was under the impression that the protagonist was going to spread her sunshine and turn the world into a happier place. Not so.

3704583,5,B001N26GFC,"Sally Hawkins has made a name for herself in the States with such films as Paddington and The Shape of Water (amazing performance!) but it's this film that wins hearts with her character of Poppy Cross, the ""happy-go-lucky"" primary school teacher that always sees the good side of life and people.

In the beginning she irritates and annoys because of her chirpy, perky optimism, and one tends to underestimate Poppy and easily dismiss her. But you find that her cheeriness is only one facet of a much complex yet happy character. You find yourself falling in love with Poppy, giggles, gurgles, gasps and all because you find that there's wisdom, strength, and compassion behind the maddening optimism.",1514851200,,702,5.0

3704589,4,B001N26GFC,"After seeing Sally Hawkins in ""Maudie"" I was curious as to her earlier work and started with this film.  I found it captivating and well crafted beginning to end, with an unexpected poignancy here and there as is often the case of movies directed by Mike Leigh...I recommend it...",1502668800,,280,4.714285714285714
3704590,5,B001N26GFC,"This is an excellent, well-shot ,and well made movie. It's just plain entertaining. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship in the film, but it's not really drawn out or exposed, and the movie is not at all about that. It can be a little strange to some viewers, but it's just plain fun and engaging to watch. It really picks up your spirits. It's hard not to love the main character, Poppy. Sally Hawkins acting in the film is genuine and fun. She seems simple minded at first, but as you keep watching, she is very interesting and makes you feel for her. Her character seems well suited for her job, which is a school teacher in the film. She even has a relationship with a man which is fun to watch. They seem good for each other. The only thing that outshines the main character, in my opinion, is Eddie Marsan as the driving instructor. He is hilarious! And so serious! His seriousness is a perfect contrast to Poppy's character. The scenes with Sally and Eddy are pure gold. This movie is a must see for just those scenes. But that is not all. The film has a fun and light hearted story. Eddy's character says a few swear words, but really the movie is quite clean. Pure fun entertainment at it's finest. This is a film I keep going back to again and again just to feel blissfully carefree about life. That is this movie's message: Don't take life too seriously. Watch, relax, and enjoy!",1492300800,,1401,4.413127413127413

3704603,5,B001N26GFC,"This is one of my favorite movies. Sally Hawkins stars as Poppy, an eternally happy soul who seems to flit through life on a different plane than most. How her personality affects those around her is truly interesting. It's a movie where some may think not much happens but it is very keeping with the movies that Mike Leigh makes where there is an emotional undercurrent that in some ways is reminiscent of Jane Austen stories where a lot of what you experience is in what's not being said.

The final big scene is quite something, and demonstrates the complexities of Poppy's character as well as the driving instructor very expertly played by Eddie Marsan. If you have watched and enjoyed other Mike Leigh movies and haven't seen this - what are you waiting for? If you want to discover the talented Sally Hawkins, you're in for a treat.",1455840000,,840,4.6375838926174495

3704607,3,B001N26GFC,"Let me begin with saying I like Mike Leigh, the director, very much. SECRET & LIES, VERA DRAK are all great!!
The thing I didn't liked about this film was the main actress, I mean charactor maybe, Sally Hawkins.
She is a chatterbox, constantly disturbing people by talking and talking and talking, let's say to make people happy which makes no sense.
For instance, when she is having a driving lesson from this driving teacher, she didn't concentrate enough so the teacher kept saying you shouldn't. You should concentrate otherwise you can even killl people on the street or even me and you. But she is totally distracted. Is it to make other people happy? I don't think so. She is almost crazy, I thought. She is wearing high heels while driving and saying I want to wear them. That is also crazy.
From the beginning, she really made me disturbed and I really didn't liked her, even though I knew what the director's meaning why he casted her.
But it was too much. She should've been a little bit less, come down a little bit. It was too much. I am not saying her acting was over the top or something. It was her nature, I think.
I hate to say this but I think it was miscasting.
I don't know why the critics are saying her acting was incredible. Maybe it is, but in a bad way. I would never love her charactor, and if the audience doesn't love her what is the meaning to acting?",1451952000,,1381,4.3565891472868215

3704609,5,B001N26GFC,"The love-it or hate-it responses to this movie are a Rorschach Test for people's outlook on life.  Sally Hawkins is triumphant in a role that could have gone so wrong in less capable hands, but is gloriously life-affirming in hers.  For me, it's a movie that bears repeat viewing and introspection about my own reaction to others around me.  I'd rather be more like Poppy and most days I feel more like Scott.  It's a rare movie that gives me this much food for thought.",1446249600,,470,4.4941176470588236
3704610,5,B001N26GFC,"Such a lovely, quirky, unpredictable story. Mike Leigh is one of my favorite directors. Sally Hawkins is perfect for the lead -- eccentric and silly but with a strong compassionate side.

3704611,2,B001N26GFC,"I like Sally Hawkins, but this slice of life movie, had no life...just a stalker.  And he wasn't even that scary.

(SPOILER)  ok, I won't spoil it for you...because that is the only part that is the climax.  The ending is dumb, and disappointing...won't spoil it for you though so can't say why its dumb...it will give it away.

3704612,5,B001N26GFC,"This is a character study about a relentlessly optimistic thirty-year-old in London. She's a kindergarten teacher and the thing is, she relates to everyone everywhere as if there's something about our inner five-year-old that never leaves us. So she's playful, patient, nurturing and honest and it works--whether it's with a sour bookstore owner, her friends and family, a mumbling homeless man, a hate-filled driving instructor or a co-worker she finds attractive. The colorful, noisy, inelegant, growth-oriented environment of kindergarten, you might protest, is not the day-to-day life of adults. But is it?",1436486400,,610,5.641304347826087

Sally Hawkes does a star turn as an elementary school teacher (who I wish I had when I was in school!) who is vivacious, creative, talented, and  funny.  And, she has a very caring nature which is directed at the whole human race, even her driving instructor who is as serious about his job as she is about having fun with life.  The interplay of these two people and a situation that arises at her school, shows a complete picture of this amazing woman, who could be your next door neighbor.

3704619,5,B001N26GFC,"Mike Leigh has written a lovely film with elements of both light and dark. The protagonist, ""Poppy"" is definitely annoying in her complete optimism but she does rise to the occasion when pushed by a very disturbed driving instructor. This moment of break through for the character gives the movie a bit more gravitas and depth and from that point on we see that Poppy is more than just a denial-driven do-gooder. The ending is a bit silly but this is a feel good movie and if you're having a blue day it's a good pick me up.",1412812800,,524,4.357142857142857

3704624,4,B001N26GFC,"Funny, sweet, a good message. Love Sally Hawkins, thought-provoking. Being happy isn't abt having a perfect life. It's abt what you do with the one you have. The scenes with driving instructor were humorous, but also sad. Although she put her life in potential danger with the schizophrenic homeless guy, I think she showed heart and compassion. She didn't try to solve his problems, just listened with a sympathetic ear to his semi coherent probably paranoid delusional rambling. But that's what he needed then. Not everyone wants to be ""fixed,"" anyway. As far as the people who say she was immature or inappropriately happy or positive, she showed maturity and knew when to be serious when the occasion called for it. The boy at school is an example. Her uptight pregnant sister was projecting her own insecurity with her life choices. She didn't fall into the trap or get defensive, just let it go. She actually approaches life in a zen-like ""live in the moment,"" way. Really loved the character and the film.",1393200000,,1012,4.855491329479769
3704625,3,B001N26GFC,"Happy-Go-Lucky is not a romantic comedy. Which is good because I hate romantic comedies.

It's not even a comedy. It's not funny. Really.

It's a sort of dark exploration of what happens when a good-natured English woman who can't or won't stop giggling at everything and everyone takes driving lessons from a misanthropic borderline sociopathic driving instructor. One thing that happens is that she giggles at him mercilessly.

I really really wish the driving instructor would have been Travis Bickle, the taxi driver in Taxi Driver.",1392768000,,536,5.209302325581396

3704628,5,B001N26GFC,"A lovely film which both entertains and challenges. The main character is a kind of delightful, accessible role model, both in demeanor and in character. I was inspired by this movie. Memorable especially in the unique character who is her driving instructor.",1389657600,,259,5.190476190476191
3704629,1,B001N26GFC,"I've tried watching this movie 3 times to try to understand just what exactly is appealing about it. I can't make it through the first half hour.

There's nothing wrong with being cheerful and having a positive outlook on life. But this character goes beyond that into the realm of a human cartoon character who seems designed to annoy everyone else around them.

Poppy (even the name makes this gratingly obvious) acts like a child. She wanders around looking at everything as if she's never been outside before. She wears layers of clothes with fringes and suns and flowers etc. She talks to anyone and everyone around her and just keeps talking no matter what response she gets to the point where she's prattling on about how the person doesn't want to talk to her in that person's presence. Poppy is presented as someone loveable, but really, she is so self absorbed it's hard to watch her.

That would be annoying enough. But the casting just makes this character worse. Of course Poppy has a huge overbite and is constantly wearing a goofy smile with her top row of teeth jutting out as the physical embodiment of her inability to keep her mouth shut in conversational terms. She wags her tongue around, jumps up and down, interrupts her friends with gesticulations and what she thinks are friendly touches. Her hair is cut like a little girl's with big bangs and she's flips it around and plays with it while she's doing whatever she's doing.

It just goes to eleven and stays there. The main plot line is triggered when she leaves her bike outside a book store. She goes inside, wanders around, tossing comments at the clerk who is busy dealing with inventory - including comments like ""busy busy are we? too busy to chat?"" After buying nothing, Poppy finds that her bike is gone when she steps out. She looks all around like it might have just wheeled itself off down the block on a lark rather than being stolen and gone. But Poppy's not going to get a new bike because she didn't get a chance to say goodbye to the old one. Instead, she's going to learn how to drive.

Then Poppy's on the bus. Oh my, so crowded we're standing. Bump in the road, goofy grin and stranger next to her as if this were some amusement park ride that they've never experienced before.

There's happy. There's lucky. And there's a child in an adult's body. You'd feel squeamish dating her, like a bit of a pedophile, because she's so childish. One minute you're kissing, then Poppy's jumping up and down on the bed then darting into the kitchen with her arms stuck out pretending she's an airplane.

Honestly, the cover says it all. If you want to watch a goofy grown-up hop up and down being constantly excited and waving her excitement in your face, this movie's for you. Otherwise, you'd hope this was a sequel to ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" and over with in a few minutes.",1388620800,,2858,4.5703125

3704631,5,B001N26GFC,"I wasn't familiar with Sally Hawkins before I saw her last week in Woody Allen's new film ""Blue Jasmine"" (in my opinion she stole the show). I was so impressed with her in ""Blue Jasmine"" that I rented ""Happy Go Lucky"" and absolutely fell in love with Poppy. I smiled though out the entire movie (except for violent scene towards the end). Poppy is so bubbly, so full of life and energy, and she's so damn cute you can't help but love her. She finds the humor in life despite being surrounded by serious, grumpy, angry people (roommate, sister, driving instructor, student).

3704637,2,B001N26GFC,"This movie can best be summed up by the very first scene in which the main character is wandering through a book store, spots a book entitled ""The Road to Reality"", looks at it, laughs, and says ""Don't want to go there"". Yes it might be funny if this attitude was not so utterly common and so deeply connected with almost every major issue facing the planet today.

But still maybe a good movie could be made on such a premise, but alas, More than half the movie consists of the very annoying main character, either chatting inanely with her friends, or turning every single comment by anyone else, into a joke which only she could possibly find funny.

Yet there seem to be many reviewers here who somehow think that she is inspiring and her attitude something to aspire to, but I would argue that maybe they are confusing the strained positivity of ignorance, with the peace of mind that comes with wisdom, yet they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.

Anyway save your time unless it is indeed your goal to be an always positive airhead.",1360540800,,1042,4.502645502645502
3704638,2,B001N26GFC,"Poppy thinks of herself as quirky, fun and kind, but you can't really be kind to people if you never put yourself in their shoes and are only interested in demonstrating your own happy personality.

 She thinks she's being friendly to the bookstore employee but she never notices that he is trying to do some work on the computer and that she is constantly interrupting him. Poppy thinks she's the funny life of the party at her dance class but she's oblivious to the fact that she disrupts it by coming in late, making the teacher repeat everything and dressing so as to be the loud, off key note in the harmonious chorus.  As a teacher herself she should know better and at the very least she could have shown a bit of sympathy when the teacher has a slight break down.  Instead she ridicules her.

 She takes her obliviously obnoxious behavior to it's most extreme by forcing her presence on a schizophrenic man who is obviously in the midst of a psychotic hallucination.  She adds to his paranoia and fear and risks her own safety, all to no purpose.  If Poppy was as kind and compassionate as this scene wants us to believe she would have quietly called the police so that the man could be taken to the hospital and given the medication and care he so desperately needed.

She's judgmental and superior toward her sister for the great sin of living a conventional lifestyle.

She's intolerably rude and disrespectful to her driving instructor, cruelly pushing him to the edge of his already fragile sanity, and she's cavalier with the lives of others as she drives recklessly down the street while talking incessantly about herself.

Poppy is thrilled with her own happy self but I'm glad I don't have to deal with her. I'll keep my grumpy but considerate friends any day.",1359158400,,1777,4.627388535031847

It pins a smile on your face and keeps it there for two hours.

3704640,4,B001N26GFC,"'Poppy' Cross has one of those unfortunate names. This cheery grade school teacher has never had a cross moment in her life. Instead, she sails on through in bright colors, chunky heels, and an unsinkably happy outlook. Even her response to a painful chiropractic crunch is to laugh at it. If you can imagine Annie Hall in short skirts and brilliant hues, you've got Poppy's attire nailed - always wrestling at least one oversized bag, lots of bits and pieces flapping in the breeze.

A few things save this from silly pointlessness. Rather than simple mania, Poppy's bright view of the world is a choice, one that she maintains with effort that rarely shows. The effort does come out, once in a while, though, like when she deals with that troubled child in her class, wound-too-tight sister, homeless man, or stalker. They cut to her serious core - but, if wounds healed the way blows to Poppy's optimism do, most emergency rooms would shut down for lack of business.

I could have wished for a little more closure regarding that troubled child. And, more than once, Poppy crossed the line into genuinely annoying - but only occasionally, and she's pathologically forgivable. On the whole, it's a fun if forgettable bit of fluff.

Poppy is everything a girl wants to be: loving, compassionate, intelligent, funny, secure and most of all...happy. The movie takes you around her world and the people in her life and shows you how she pours love into those around her. It's humorous, it's sad, it's sexy: it's everything you'd want from a movie. The disc includes a segment in the 'extras' that has interviews of Mike Leigh (the director), Sally (who plays Poppy), Eddie (who plays Scott) and Alexis (who plays Zoe).  I think this was one of my favorite parts of the disc!  While listening to them describe Poppy and how Mike created her character and her world, I felt a huge respect for the movie and those involved. It was well planned, and it shows in the movie. I loved hearing the way they convey not only the characters, but each other. Their description of Poppy had me jotting down all of the adjectives they used: open, free, funny, generosity of the spirit, compassionate, a huge heart, a huge soul...happy.

3704645,1,B001N26GFC,"<strong>Happy-Go-Lucky</strong> (Mike Leigh, 2008)

I guess I should probably start off with a warning that, despite the utter predictability of the climax of this film, the review does contain what could be construed as a major spoiler. Not that it matters, as you will have turned it off long before you get to that point, but still.

- - -

I persist in the belief, for some reason I am quite incapable of figuring out, that Mike Leigh will eventually make a film that will not make me want to kill myself within five minutes of my starting to watch it. And so I continue to watch Mike Leigh movies. I'm sure my therapist is very happy with this arrangement. The most recent one to cross my path is <em>Happy-Go-Lucky</em>, which was, inexplicably, nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (the movie was also written by Leigh). But then, <em>Sideways</em> was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay as well, and that made just as little sense. And it WON!

Plot: Poppy (<em>Made in Dagenham</em>'s Sally Hawkins) is a 30-year-old preschool teacher living in London. The title of the film gives you a clue into her personality, albeit a quite understated one. Poppy is manic at her calmest times, stubbornly refuses to look at life in any sort of logical manner, and repeatedly puts herself into situations where, in the real world, she would be in imminent danger of losing her life. That all of this is glossed over (with the underlying ""just let go of your worries and be happy-go-lucky and all will be right with your life!"" message, which is of course a load of complete codswallop) is one of the defining points of the film. If you have no problems with that, and with Poppy's personality, you will probably like this. In any case, I digress. Thanks to Poppy's bike being stolen, she decides she needs to, at long last, learn to drive a car. The instructor assigned to her by the driving school is Scott (<em>V for Vendetta</em>'s Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite in every way that's important (at least to the film). While Poppy's driving lessons are only one part of an ensemble piece, they quickly become the main focus of the film, culminating in... the most predictable opposites-attract storyline imaginable.

Except that Mike Leigh can't even get THAT right. There is not one iota of indication anywhere in this film until Scott's big climactic blow-up that he is in any way attracted to Poppy (and to Leigh's ever-so-minor credit, that single fact is the only thing that makes Poppy's reaction during that scene even remotely acceptable). It's a climax without a storyline. Okay, I exaggerate a bit. There is one scene that gives it away, though it could also be interpreted as either ""wow, creepy stalker dude!"" or ""hey, isn't it interesting that we live a block from one another?"" (Which is how I interpreted it... right up until writing that last paragraph, actually.) But this is synecdochic of the entire film, which is filled with episodic set pieces that are supposed to be pregnant with importance (and, I'm sure, are supposed to tie back to the driving-lesson plotline). But here's the thing... they never are. This is an emperor who has no clothes at all. Why this continues to surprise me in the case of Mike Leigh is entirely beyond me. Perhaps, finally, I will give up after seeing this, an even worse film than <em>Topsy-Turvy</em>. ",1325116800,,3386,4.789383561643835

While I was watching the movie for the first time, I realized I couldn't understand a lot of the things some of the characters were saying (really thick british accent). So I ended up buying this DVD half way through so that I can turn on the subtitles to watch it (because I really had to pay attention to every detail for my paper). So the on demand helped me through my first draft, and a couple of days later, this arrived, and I was able to watch it again and write my final draft. Fast shipping, simple yet effective packaging.

That Poppy is an annoying as any human on Earth! She's the 'happy' character of the film, and I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to appreciate her irrepressible jolliness, her refusal to submit to or even acknowledge any of the less gleeful feelings of people around her -- her two sisters, her house mate, her flamenco teacher, and the sorry sod of a driving instructor whom she torments with her 'carefree' narcissism. The driving teacher is her antipode, a guy who grieves and rages at life in as unbalanced a fashion as Poppy smirks and jives. He blames Life -- his other students and 'the multiculturalists' especially, and finally he blames Poppy for seducing/manipulating him with her flirtatious bouyancy. But in subtler ways, Poppy also blames or judges nearly everyone for their 'failure' to be as 'happy' as she professes to be. Is she really that happy, or is she hysterically acting out happiness?

I suppose it's well enough made, this film. Well enough acted. A sociological study of a certain age/class cohort of ordinary youngish people in England today. But it wasn't fun to watch.",1317427200,,1230,4.880382775119617

3704659,2,B001N26GFC,"Going into Happy-Go-Lucky, I wanted to like it.  The premise sounded interesting -- a relentlessly positive person facing life and perhaps overcoming less than positive moments.  Oh, what a let down.  Truth be told, Happy-Go-Lucky is the story of a daffy woman who we never really get to know -- a woman who laughs (at times inappropriately) at almost everything, including physical pain.  In fact, she can't bring herself to answer a straight question without giggling and coming up with some whimsical nonsense line looking to draw a laugh, avoid the question, or both.  Through all of this, she remains an ultimately irritating enigma, keeping from the audience any clue about what makes her tick, why she can't seem to take anything seriously (including the feelings of others), and why she does oddly dangerous and inappropriate things (like striking up a conversation with a brooding homeless man in the dark of night in a secluded spot -- and sticking around even after he acts in ways that might reasonably be perceived as threatening).

In all of her laughter, the main character seems so incapable of listening to other people or reading their feelings that she laughs off signs that her driving instructor has significant mental problems and might be developing a threatening interest in her.  When he finally blows his lid and does something that would make any sensible person call the police -- if not for her sake, then for the sake of others who might follow -- she ultimately laughs it off while paddling down life's highway, oblivious, it seems, to real human interaction and the need for some grain of seriousness to make all the laughter have any worth at all.",1263081600,,1680,4.894366197183099
3704660,4,B001N26GFC,"This is not a perfect movie.  However, it's a very good one.  Not sure that I understand some of the negative reviews- If you want a typical movie with a ""proper"" plot and story arc, you never should have been looking at this one in the first place (stick with mainstream Hollywood!).

This is a character study and the primary character is an interesting and entertaining one.  Not as unrealistic as some seem to indicate either- I have known at least a couple people not too unlike Polly.  Incidentally, the story does depict a more serious side to her as well, so she is a bit more multidimensional than initially meets the eye (most of the scenes showing her teaching, dealing w/ the bully in particular, show she was fully capable of being a responsible adult/teacher).

As many have pointed out, including the director himself, the core of this movie involves the interaction between Polly and her driving instructor (Scott- played brilliantly by the very underrated character actor Eddie Marson).  It is worth watching this movie for the scenes involving these two alone.

Yes, the movie is more a series of vignettes rather than following a cohesive storyline.  However, they do work as part of a larger picture depicting the character of Polly.

Poppy is a 30-year-old teacher, who behaves like a hyperactive 6-year-old. Of course a 6-year-old is usually ridiculously cheery, as most kids that age are. But to see a 30-year old act like this, is gruesome.

The only problem with the movie and the premise is that there are better movies with the same premise. I do rather go happy-go-lucky with Brazilian or Bollywood movies. Better plots, more fun music, and happiness having many more varied forms.

The actors were ok, the plot quite obvious, and the outcomes of Poppy's actions never lead to any conflict. There many cliches in the movie, but what would have made the movie better was if at all the character was lead to some conflict. Poppy's happiness is  kind of washed out, the happiness of people who have gone too far believing on something, and then look back wishing life was something else.

3704668,3,B001N26GFC,"Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" has a lot to recommend it, not least being a star turn by little-known (at least on this side of the pond) Sally Hawkins as Poppy, the happy-go-lucky character of the title.  Poppy is a human cherry soda with a healthy splash of vodka - full of life, almost overly sweet, and just a bit dangerous.

It's interesting that someone could make a movie where the key question is, can someone really go through life reacting to every single thing with a positive attitude?  Such a person is Poppy, an effervescent bohemian elementary school teacher in London.  Poppy's the kind of gal who responds to her bike being stolen as creating an opportunity to drive.  She responds to virtually every line in a conversation with a little joke or pun and a friendly snicker.  She's not a wise-acre, or a comedian who's ""always on"" - she's just walking on the sunny side of the street every blasted day.

Life eventually conspires to put roadblocks in her path as she meets new people, including the troubled, the homeless, and the perfect (a late-movie candidate for Serious Boyfriend is just a bit too much from Central Casting to be believed).  Some of these folks react to Poppy with delight, others with fear, and one in particular with blinding rage as her friendliness is mistaken for flirtatiousness.  Eventually even Poppy confronts a person that even she cannot abide.

Why only three stars?  Perhaps I'm being unfair - I like much of this movie, not least the fact that ""HGL"" is one of those charming British movies where you almost need subtitles to understand the dialect.  This isn't a movie where Judie Dench is ripping off perfectly enunciated sentences to John Gielgud - this is a Street Movie where characters talk like real people.  Sure, you lose something in the process, but the rhythm gets you where you need to go.

Unfortunately the sad fact is that this movie is essentially without a plot.  The story is just about Poppy and her daily life.  We see her interact with a few people, many of whom are in one scene and then vanish.  Sure, there's a bit of conflict with her driving instructor and a bit of romance, but essentially we're watching Poppy waltz through life.  I confess that I like a bit more plot on the bones of my movies - it's the same reason why ""2001"" has never done anything for me.  Perhaps that makes me a Philistine, but there you go.

I also have grave problems with one scene where Poppy goes off by herself at night to confront a homeless man.  Poppy, a super-sweet girl who just might be able to take down a butterfly as long as it didn't get the jump on her, should know much better than to take such a stupid risk in London.  Perpetual cheerfulness is fine, but it doesn't help you in every situation.  My problem with this scene is that it was so unrealistic and stupid a maneuver that it reminded me that I was watching a movie.  It reminded me to stop suspending my disbelief, and everything that followed this scene felt contrived.

As a result, I must put ""HGL"" in the category of Good Film That I Have No Interest in Watching Again for a Long Time, if Ever.  Thus, three stars.",1255996800,,3149,4.548845470692718

She says aloud that she's sorry she didn't get to say goodbye.  That's your movie right there; all the rest is filling in the details (and trying to understand the North London accents).  And at the end of the the journey -- slight spoiler here -- if Poppy has found that she cannot bring cheer to those who will not accept it, nor will she let the sometimes bitter and unrewarding world she inhabits consume her.  That wasn't enough for a number of other reviewers here.  I'm not sure why.  Poppy's is not an unexamined life.  Rather, she's examined it and found it works for her.

3704671,5,B001N26GFC,"I saw this in the theater, on a weekday matine when there was one other patron, a middle-aged lady sitting across the aisle from me who kept dropping things loudly. Somehow this added to the experience of the film, which is about a positively positive young woman, Poppy (Sally Hawkins, just brilliant) who just won't let anything stand in her way of enjoying her life and loving everyone in it as much as she can -- until she meets her anti-human match in Scott (Eric Marsan), a frighteningly angry, racist and sexist driving instructor who probably ought to be locked up, or at least not having such contact with the general public. Poppy's a working class girl in Mike Leigh's modern-day London, and that means full of quirks and foibles and not in the least bit glamorous or obvious; much of the charm in the film as in most of the Leigh films I've seen is in not knowing what's going to come next, except that it will be unusual -- but never untrue.

Poppy has a couple of sisters, a best friend, and the beginnings of a relationship to contend with along with her crazy driver training class (necessitated by the theft of her bike through typical carelessness in the first scene) and she navigates all of them with her chin up -- though never with her brain turned off. I'm sure there are some who will be very irritated with this blast of sun through the rainbow, but speaking as a depressive who typically hates Pollyanna characters -- I just loved her - and the film.

At the end, when Poppy and Scott have hit a point of no return, my emotions really went through the ringer - and I think I started to see what Poppy was missing, and that perhaps she knew that she was missing it. Her failure to understand misery is in some ways just as limiting to her understanding of other people and the world as Scott's inability to ever forget it, though it's much less destructive. As she goes for a boat ride I'm reminded of Jacques Rivette's ""Celine and Julie Go Boating"", a fantasy different in almost every respect from this dose of hard reality and broad humor - but I think that Poppy, like the characters in that film, knows that she's in some ways living in a fantasy world of her own making. And maybe, given some of the alternatives, that's not such an awful thing.",1252972800,,2276,4.4556354916067145

3704673,4,B001N26GFC,"As noted in other reviews here, one's liking of 'Happy-Go-Lucky,' Mike Leigh's latest improvisational gem, depends almost solely on your acceptance of Sally Hawkins' relentlessly optimistic, chatterbox character, Poppy.  Personally, I found her unstintingly charming and endearing, just a real treat on the screen.  [And if you question whether that's acting or just her up there, check out Ms. Hawkins' turn as 'Slasher' in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Layer-Cake-Widescreen/dp/B0009X7BDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Layer Cake (Widescreen)</a>.]  I was equally taken with Poppy's flatmate, Zoe, winningly played by Lexi Zegerman.  She won the British Independent Film Award for Best Supporting Actress for this portrayal.  Rightfully so: her scenes - almost all with Poppy - help Hawkins flesh out the nature of her character.  Ms. Zegerman is a supporting actress in the best sense of the word.

You can't talk about this movie without mentioning Eddie Marsan, flat-out brilliant as Scott the driving instructor, and the polar opposite of Poppy's unending reservoirs of cheerfulness.  It's the scenes of Poppy and Scott together in the car that form the core of the movie.  Poppy bubbling and chattering and joking, Scott seething and resenting and, finally, breaking.  And, when he does break, an astounding rush of pent-up, repressed thoughts come tumbling forth.  If you've seen Leigh's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Drake/dp/B0007P0YKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera Drake</a>, you will remember Marsan as the shy, low-key suitor of Drake's daughter.  Same guy!  Now, that's acting.

And, d-mn you, Eddie, I've been repeating 'en-ra-ha!' to myself all day!  As his character Scott states, ""You will remember 'en-ra-ha'.""  Indeed!",1252281600,,1832,6.326612903225806

My lessons started with concepts identified in the movie ""The Secret"" and continued with teachings of Abraham-Hicks and Dr. Wayne Dyer on CD/DVD, among various other teachers.  And it's a wonderfully liberating and happy perspective on life!

So when I rented ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" I was thrilled to see a movie character whose attitude toward life seemed to be based on some of the ideas I have been learning. And Sally Hawkins, as Poppy, does it so beautifully! The supporting cast is just as brilliant, from Eddie Marsan as Scott (the perfect foil!), to flatmate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman), to sisters Suzy and Helen (Kate O'Flynn and Caroline Martin).

What a breath of fresh air to see Poppy living gratefully, joyfully, in-the-moment.  I watched the movie twice before returning it to the rental store, then immediately ordered it on Amazon.  I felt I just had have this example of living life good-humoredly, and realizing that happiness is a choice. I wanted to have it on hand whenever I need the reminder.

A word to those who can't wrap their minds around the concept that the best way to have a lovely life is to choose to be happy always, this movie will just annoy you.

3704675,1,B001N26GFC,"What do you get when you strap a camera to a woman's head and just film her days and nights, then edit it all down to 2 hours? Probably something very close to this movie, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.

The tag line for HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is: The one movie this fall that will put a smile on your face. But it didn't. I checked. I never smiled or laughed or even chuckled. I grimaced twice and cringed once, but I never smiled.

HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is very much a stream of consciousness flick. Even as I type this, I am at a loss to tell you the point of the movie. I know it was about a woman, pretty, 30, a school teacher, never married, who lives with her girlfriend, has a troubled student, meets a crazy guy under a bridge, has issues with her sisters, sleeps with a social worker, and is learning to drive from a crazed conspiracy theorist. But I'm still trying divine what it's about. I did work out that the main character, Poppy, is both happy and luck because, in a bit of clever writing she says, ""I am happy. I'm a very lucky lady.""

There is really nothing at all about HAPPY-GO-LUCKY that stands out. Not the acting, not the story, not the scenery, not the soundtrack, and especially not the writing - nothing. And when it was over, I felt cheated at having sat through it all with the hope that suddenly the disparate elements would congeal around one moment and I would say, ""Wow."" Sadly, that moment did come but it left me decidedly un-wowed.

Now comes the worst part. I saved it for last.

As if to confirm my suspicions that I will never ever be invited to be a Member of the Academy, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY was nominated for an Oscar. In addition, it has won awards from all over the world, including a Golden Arena Award at the Pula Film Festival. Yeah. You heard me right. After my review, I'm pretty sure I'll never be invited back to Pula.

On the ""No Country for Old Men"" scale, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY comes in a tick or two higher simply because Poppy never says, ""Friend-o.""",1250985600,,1965,4.384615384615385
3704676,3,B001N26GFC,"Honestly, I can't quite see this as a comedy, more of a character study and human drama. Sally Hawkins plays the eternally optimistic and highly cheerful [annoyingly so at times] primary [elementary] school teacher Poppy, who goes through life smiling & bouncing along, attired in mind-boggling, outrageous outfits in brilliant, bold colors. When Poppy's bicycle gets stolen, she shrugs it off and begins driving lessons under the tutelage of acerbic and uptight Scott [Eddie Marsan]. Both these individuals are poles apart, and the driving scenes had some of the truly hilarious and maddening scenes in the movie [en-ra-ha! en-ra-ha! goes Scott, as he vainly tries to get Poppy focused on driving, whilst she's busy looking at squirrels whilst behind the wheel!].

What works - Sally Hawkins [who was amazing in the BBC period drama ""Persuasion""] is credible in her role as the upbeat and happy Poppy. She is 30, single, has lived with a female flatmate [who's also her BFF] for 10 years, and is okay with it [despite her younger, married and pregnant sister's remonstrations that she get a 'real' life]. This is an individual that seems utterly at ease with her life, taking flamenco lessons from an emotionally distraught dance instructor [another highlight of the film are the dance lessons and the emotional outbursts by the instructor]. Yet, despite Hawkins' convincing [and yes, annoying] performance, there seems to be something darker underneath - as though this eternal cheerfulness and upbeat manner is masking Polly's own awkwardness in some situations. I just got the sense [perhaps I'm wrong] that this over-cheerful manner wasn't all natural.

The movie also seems choppy in its storytelling - some of the scenes don't really mesh- it's like a series of different stories being put together to form a movie. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't really see this as a comedy, more of a character study. The supporting cast are credible enough, but the almost manic driving instructor, as portrayed by Eddie Marsan was especially compelling in his performance, spittle and all. I'd have given it 4*, but the movie was too long, at almost 2 hrs, and could have been better with some editing.",1248739200,,2198,5.069060773480663

3704678,2,B001N26GFC,"I am a fan of Mike Leigh films and ran out to get this one as soon as it came out on DVD.  Unfortunately, Secrets and Lies or Vera Drake it isn't!

While Leigh's other films feature downtrodden people living depressing existances, this movie's main character, Poppy, is so annoyingly happy and giggly all the time, it doesn't come off as real at all.  For example, when her bike gets stolen, she's smiling and carefree.  When her driving instructor berates her and is flying into a rage, gales of giggling ensue.  She treats everything as a joke and can't keep her mouth shut for a second without laughing through basically every line she has in the film.  It just feels forced and completely fake.

Sadly, the only believable characters I found were the boy Poppy taught that was being abused at home, and the unstable, raging driving instructor.  The few and far between dramatic bits were the only realistic moments in it.

I'm quite surprised of the accolades this movie received, and that Sally Hawkins received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress as well.  Mike Leigh's films are very loosely scripted and the actors are encouraged to improvise their scenes.  This is done ably in his other films by vetran actresses such as Brenda Blethyn and Imelda Staunton, but I just felt that it was too big of a responsibility for Sally Hawkins and she failed miserably.",1244851200,,1373,4.726890756302521
3704679,4,B001N26GFC,"Yes, another in a long line of movies about quirky women who dress wacky, but ...but! This movie is completely worth seeing for Sally Hawkins, her semi androgynous beauty, her expressive face and body... it is worth it alone to see the scene when she goes to a flamenco dancing lesson...when she realizes she left her sunglasses perched on her head.. I can not give it away, it showed Sally's gift at physical comedy. I loved the special feature that explained the making of the movie, the intricacies involved with shooting in the car,the interviews with the actors and actresses... the featurette gave so much good information it made me understand the movie more, and THEN I actually sat and watched the whole movie again with the sparkling and completely engrossing commentary by director Mike Leigh! I highly recommend the movie, the extras, and especially the commentary.

I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I could not understand chunks of dialogue because of the strong accents/jargon.. but I do love the accents and jargon ... there was a wee bit too much with the driving instructor, he was SUCH an unlikable character, I could not find the part of his character that would make me care about him, ( altho the actor who played him was excellent especially if you watch him being interviewed and he is nothing like that creepy weirdo) ...and also because of the scene when the driving instructor pulled Poppy;s hair and yet she  still treated him oh so kindly after he assaulted her, that was the only annoying unbelievable thing to me.. Later when I heard the commentary Mike Leigh explained what he was trying to convey mixing Poppy and the driving instructor.. they were the opposites in life.

The other actresses who played Poppy's sisters and friends and co workers were wonderful and added a richness and sweetness to the whole mix. The actor who played Poppy's boyfriend was so charming and believeable, but as we learn later in the featurette, the actor is a Shakespearean actor... Oh those amazing British actors and actresses with their extensive and amazing theatrical educations! It shows! They all make it seem effortless and natural.

The flamenco instructor was an actress who really stood out, too, what an amazing and scene stealing wonderful actress!
I hope you enjoy this movie, it really was, on a whole, delightful and uplifting and lovely!

PS- some other reviewers felt Poppy was not truly happy, or was irresponsible, or was evil. Their view points were very interesting to me, but I did not think so. There is a scene where she tells her sister how she feels about her life and I felt that Poppy was sincere in her happiness, that she truly had a gift about seeing the best in people or situations, maybe to a fault tho. But aren't all characters flawed or confused or a mix of good hearted with a streak of something else? Which would explain her acting out with the driving instructor. At 30, which seems to be not that old these days, she was a woman still growing into her own.",1244073600,,3014,4.71157495256167
3704680,4,B001N26GFC,"This is an interesting character study.  How often in life do we encounter people who are genuinely a joy to be around?  Poppy(Sally Hawkins) is just naturally a happy person.  Her ebullience is not some defense mechanism or a mask for some inner depression.  Life isn't a complete bowl of cherries for Poppy but she copes through her lust for the better things life has to offer.  This film is not some cynical exercise rife with manipulation.  Director Mike Leigh keeps the film firmly grounded in reality.  It also helps to have a superb actress like Hawkins to project likability and make it believable.  Hawkins, stiffed at Oscar time, is a real find and it will interesting to follow the trajectory of her career.",1243728000,,719,4.741935483870968
3704681,1,B001N26GFC,"This movie is extremely unpleasant to watch.  In addition to an intensely unlikeable lead character, the plot is a mess, best seen in the Poppy character being so at odds with the movie's stated intent (from its description).

I couldn't decide whether the lead character Poppy was mentally ill or just evil.  There is evidence both ways, but leans to the former.  At times she seems to be using a forced oblivious cheerfulness as a defense or coping mechanism against the serious problems in her own life.

But in the relationship with the driving instructor Scott, she spots his vulnerability--that he takes pride in his work--and ruthlessly exploits it.  She is intent on making his life miserable, and to amuse herself, she is quite willing--through intentionally bad driving--to risk killing someone or destroy Scott's livelihood (his car).  An alternate interpretation is that this spreading of misery to others is a coping mechanism.

One thing Poppy is not is ""happy-go-lucky"" (with the possible exception of the bike theft in the opening).  There are several instances where she drops out of the ""cheerful"" persona to behave as a responsible adult, for example the troubled boy at school and the ending (that comes out of nowhere).  An actual happy-go-lucky person would have behaved quite differently.  Also, happy-go-lucky people tend to try to spread joy, not misery, to those around them.  Instead, Poppy is relentlessly self-involved, self-absorbed, obnoxious, ...  To call her simply ""annoying"" is to miss the point.

----

Unfortunately, in choosing this movie, I relied solely on movie critic's reviews, not consulting Amazon, so I kept watching expecting something positive.  Recognize that the reviews here are much more negative than the simple composite score once you discount the multiple (positive) reviews that echo the movie's promotional materials.  Also, the Amazon entry under Editorial Reviews above (by Bret Fetzer) initially seems quite positive, but contains many warnings when read carefully (paying attention to word choices and phrasing).

Aside: Regarding the driving instructor character Scott, Americans should understand that Britain takes a much more rigorous approach to driving instruction and tests than we do.  When I lived there (1987), I heard from other Americans with many years of driving experience that they were skeptical about their ability to pass the British test.  Scott is expected to teach students discipline, alertness and responsibility.  In their negative take on this character, the director and script writers would seem to add further weight to their presentation of anti-social behavior as being fun-loving.",1243641600,,2674,5.395180722891566
3704682,2,B001N26GFC,"Poppy - the titular happy-go-lucky - is a 30-year-old single teacher played by Sally Hawkins.  She lives with a female friend and enjoys her single life, which includes drinking with friends in pubs and riding around on her bike.  One day, her bike is stolen, and she decides to take driving lessons instead of replacing the bike.  Enter her driving teacher, the unfriendly, overly serious Scott (Eddie Marsan).

""Happy-Go-Lucky"" received very good reviews and several Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture Musical or Comedy.  Thus, I was expecting a light, comedic movie.  However, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is anything but a comedy.  Mike Leigh's ""comedies"" are often underlined with a rather morose sadness, but ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" takes this trend a step further.  Poppy is superficially cheerful and optimistic, but her forced cheerfulness seems to be a means of covering her inability to cope with uncomfortable situations, like a nervous laugh.  Listening to her constant giggles and snorts is extremely grating.  The driving scenes are particularly irritating, with Poppy nervously giggling and snorting nonstop and Eddie angrily yelling for Poppy to pay attention.  There are a few laughs in a segment involving an emotionally unstable flamenco dance teacher, which is quite funny but also pretty much disconnected from the rest of the film.

As a comedy, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" fails miserably.  How about as a drama then?  Well, as a drama it also falls short as the main character is so thoroughly annoying that it's hard to root for her or care about her life.  This movie, however, has obviously appealed to some audiences and critics; some people seem drawn to Poppy and her life.  I'd say that if you like Mike Leigh in general, you'll like this film much better than I did.  I don't generally like Leigh's films, aside from the superb ""Topsy Turvy"" (1999).  I like ""Topsy Turvy"" because it seems more scripted than his other works; he's famous for having only a script outline and then working with his actors to ""improvise"" the action.  Unfortunately, the improvisation is all too apparent here, especially with some of the supporting actors who are extremely stiff and seem as though they're acting in a different film.  I was sorely disappointed with ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" - the movie is amateurishly made and was really chore to wade through to the end.",1243036800,,2362,5.133507853403142

3704685,5,B001N26GFC,"This is one of those films in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Until near the end of the film, virtually nothing of consequence has happened.  The entire affair is a slice of life movie, focused entirely on small, typical moments in an irrepressibly chipper and upbeat 30-year-old Londoner named Poppy.  We get glimpses of her social life, her professional life, her romantic life, her recreational life, and her attempt to learn to drive.

The film is buoyed by Mike Leigh's usual light yet deft touch, always managing to get out of the ways to allow his actors to do what they do best.  And as usual, his actors are better in his films than they are in just about anything that they do.  Leigh consistently creates some of the best opportunities for actresses than any other director active today.  I know of absolutely no director who has gotten more superb performances out of actresses over the past 15 years than Leigh.  We've seen not one, not two, but three absolutely stellar performances in three of his films in which actresses turned in what were consensus international choices as the best performances that year by actresses.  The one and only awards organization to consistently ignore these performances have been the Oscars.  In 1996 Brenda Blethyn won every single Best Actress award in the world for SECRETS AND LIES (well over 20 awards in all), all except the Oscar (which Frances McDormand won for her excellent but vastly less impressive performance in FARGO).  Then in 2004 Imelda Staunton was almost universally acclaimed the Best Actress for the title role of VERA DRAKE, but Hillary Swank (like Frances McDormand, in one of her few wins over Staunton) won the Oscar for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  Now in 2008 Sally Hawkins won a shelf full of awards for her extraordinary performance as Poppy (including the Golden Globe and the NY Film Critics Circle Award, in addition to many others).  So how did she do at the Oscars?  Would you believe that she wasn't even nominated?  I've become increasingly dismissive of the Oscars over the years, primarily because they rarely recognize true excellence and give awards based on familiarity and popularity (McDormand over Blethyn, Swank over Staunton).  So of course the Oscars failed to even nominate what was perhaps the finest performance by any actress in 2008.

The wonderful thing about this movie is how we get to know and like Poppy.  The film has little or no plot so what drive it has comes from our silent witnessing of how she lives her life, always upbeat, joking, and kidding.  We see her in her trampoline class.  We see her taking flamenco lessons. We see her giddily get an adjustment from a chiropractor.  And, most of all, we see her taking driving lessons with a fascinating but mentally and emotionally unstable driving instructor (brilliantly portrayed by Eddie Marsan) who becomes oddly attracted to her.  We get to see Poppy from a number of perspectives and as we see her happily and compassionately making her way through life, we come to love her and pull for her.  I think ultimately whether you love, like, or hate this movie will inevitably depend on your reaction to Poppy.  Sally Hawkins endows her with such passion and pluck that I loved her despite finding her jocularity sometimes a tad grating.  And while by no means a beauty, Hawkins through the force of her personality makes Poppy surprisingly attractive.

I was not terribly familiar with Sally Hawkins prior to this film.  I remember her from VERA DRAKE, but nothing else.  I do plan on seeing the most recent adaptation of Jane Austen's PERSUASION, in which she had the lead role.  Hopefully she'll be in a long string of movies that I can enjoy her in in the future.",1241049600,,3747,4.783825816485225
3704686,4,B001N26GFC,"Happy-Go-Lucky stars Sally Hawkins as Poppy, a 30 year old London elementary school teacher who is so cheerful she makes Pollyanna look like Eeyore.

The film doesn't follow any Hollywood formula, so here is fair advance warning.  You may not like ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" if:
1. You dislike ""British Humor"".
2. You have difficulty following non-American English.
3. You dislike films without a definite or obvious ""plot"".

There is a decidedly British genre that I would loosely describe as ""get a handful of interesting characters together and follow them a few days"". (I recently watched ""The Station Agent"" and although the characters and setting were different, it shares this genre.)

Poppy isn't just cheerful.  She finds almost any situation a suitable one for a joke and a laugh.  In the opening she rides her bicycle to a bookstore where she tries unsuccessfully to get the attention of the bearded young man who works there.  She goes outside to discover her bicycle has been stolen.  She is disappointed and says ""I didn't even get to say good-bye!""

The stolen bike leads Poppy to decide to take driving lessons.  She hires the increasingly serious and severely humorless Scott, played by Eddie Marsan.  Some of the funniest scenes in the film and certainly the most serious one take place during Poppy's driving lessons.

Poppy has shared a flat with Zoe for ten years, and she has two younger sisters who don't share her irrepressible cheery disposition.

I could give you the entire ""plot"" and although I wouldn't be giving you many ""spoilers"", I also wouldn't be giving you much encouragement to watch the movie.

3704687,5,B001N26GFC,"I have a hard time explaining to others why Mike Leigh is among my favorite directors.  His films don't have brilliantly complex plots or uniquely beautiful visual style or many of the other traits that most people associate with great directors.  He is, however, an excellent scriptwriter - he's created several of the most intriguing characters in cinema - and an excellent director of actors.  But even that doesn't really explain why he would be among my favorite directors - and I don't know how to explain it, other than to say that his films impact me on a gut level.  I find them tremendously moving and moral and beautiful.  They make me laugh and they make me cry.  I can understand why some find his style of ""social realism"" to be boring, but to me they are far from boring or simple.  In fact, few films involve me and move me as much as his.

""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is another masterpiece from Mike Leigh.  As with most of his films, there is no real villain, and not much of a plot - but it is still very funny, and very moving.  It may be among his most simple efforts, but it is far from shallow - as with all of his films, the sometimes mundane events of the plot hide complex and profound truths.  Sally Hawkins is marvelous as Poppy, who is, depending on the viewer, one of the most endearing or one of the most annoying characters to appear in quite some time depending on the viewer.  Eddie Marsan is equally fantastic as her bitter, conspiracy theorist driving instructor.

It's not exactly a feel-good comedy as some of the advertisements (and DVD menus) will have you believe - but it is ultimately a positive film, that may just reaffirm your faith in humanity.",1240012800,,1681,4.508250825082508

It didn't get any attention from the Academy, but was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes and star Sally Hawkins won a Golden Globe for her performance as a perpetually happy school teacher named Poppy. As I will explain later, it wasn't her performance that most impressed me.

Written and directed by Mike Leigh, Happy-Go-Lucky stars Hawkins as Poppy, an elementary school teacher who is one of those people that is always happy. One of those people who are so happy it almost makes you angry. After stopping in a bookstore, Poppy's bike is stolen, leading her to take driving lessons. Her driving instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan), who is Poppy's polar opposite; humorless and straight-forward. The two don't get along very well, but when Poppy gets involved with a social worker she unexpectedly gets a jealous reaction from Scott.

I have to add that it's hard to think of Poppy as simply ""happy"" There are times when it seems like she might be slightly insane. Scott doesn't seem completely sane himself though.

The film does have a consistent British charm that makes it hard to stop smiling. It has the tone of a typical romantic-comedy, but it's more well-written than any of those films with more memorable characters as well.

The dialogue has its shining moments too. The banter between Scott and Poppy upon their initial meeting (and later ones) is fast-paced, brilliant, and hilarious. Scott is right when he says ""you won't forget Enraha.""

Ms. Hawkins has a sort of insatiable, spunky charm that is really delightful. She doesn't give any sort of tour de force performance but she's so perfect in the role. It's a relatively simple character, yet it seems like it must have been challenging.

Marsan is pitch-perfect as the no-nonsense, uptight instructor. It's Marsan I really want to talk about. He is just as impressive as Hawkins, if not more so. This is an actor that comes out of nowhere and totally nails this character, warts and all.

Through the entire film, I enjoyed his presence but didn't necessarily like his character. When he confronts Poppy in the film, I found myself instantly empathizing with him. It's really a perfect, Award-worthy performance. No reviews make much mention of Marsan, but he's the true breakthrough in this film.

I don't know about Happy-Go-Lucky being one of the best films of 2008, but it's a charming, somewhat sad film. It's worth recommending on the basis of its witty script and the performances of Marsan and Hawkins.

On the other hand, she's a thirty-year-old single lady with time on her hands, as her gal pals are dressing up for dance night or Flamingo lessons. There's a very funny moment in that dance lesson, but you'll see for yourself.

3704691,2,B001N26GFC,"Someones acceptance of this movie totally hinges on their tolerance of Sally Hawkins character.  If you are charmed by goofy, never stop talking British eccentrics then you may like Happy Go Lucky.

If people who never shut up annoy you, people who will say anything just to be saying something, then this probably ain't the movie for you.

I was surprised because I'm a big Mike Leigh fan.  Life is Sweet is an all time favorite and was far more off center and weird than Happy Go Lucky.  It had plenty of weird characters that all became endearing and real by the end.  I kept waiting for Hawkins character to become lovable the way the mom did in Life is Sweet, the way the bloviating Jim Broadbent did in Topsy-Turvy.  Never happens.  Happy Go Lucky by contrast is filled with a mix of either annoying characters (Hawkins, driving instructor, Flamenco instructor) or dull characters (co-workers, boyfriend, abused student, roommate).

Leigh's penchant for not working off of scripts goes wrong in this one and turns the movie into a bunch of patched together skits that do little to build a cohesive whole.  It's telling that the best scene in the movie, her encounter with a homeless man, is the only time she has very little to say.  Unfortunately, the scene is compromised because it is a totally forced situation.  Just as in a slasher movie where people always do stupid things to get themselves killed, we are expected to accept that someone would actually walk down a dark alley in a bad neighborhood at night in hopes of making an interesting acquaintance.  It reeks of plot device and undermines the scene.

The movie gets a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, Hawkins won a Golden Globe and universal acclaim.  So obviously, I'm not seeing something everyone else did.  You may want to rent it and judge for yourself...",1238371200,,1821,4.733333333333333
3704692,1,B001N26GFC,"I can't say much about this film, as I write this I am still suffering through the film...  I was surprised by how many 5 stars there are for this movie.  The first ten minutes of a movie is the most important.  Here you are to set up the plot and give the audience a reason to care about the people in the story.  Happy go lucky spends the first 10 minutes effectively boring the audience, ignoring the plot all together.  I'm 47 minutes into the movie now and still wondering what the story is, where the plot is?  15 minutes into the movie we have seen Poppy, the lead character of the movie, annoy a bookkeeper, dance at a concert with her girlfriends, get drunk, get High and make a bird mask out of a paper bag and not say anything understandable.  20 mins in we discover this party girl is a elementary school teacher!  Just what I want for my kid, a teacher who gets drunk and high on her weekends.

30 mins in she gets a driving lesson from a complete jerk.  (why she is 30 and not driving yet who knows...)  But of course if I was her instructor I'd probably yell at her too... I'd probably gag her with duct tape or something...

I'm not going to go on... this is the worst indie film I've ever seen.  I don't care about any of the characters, heck I don't even know who they are or what is going on in any of their lives.  Poppy just laughs at everything and makes inappropriate jokes about everything.  She has to be the most annoying person on earth.  This is not a film worth watching and I'm not sure why those above liked it.  I found it mostly annoying and at this point I'm not sure why I'm still watching it.  Don't buy it, rent it if you must but don't waste your money on this one.

If you want to buy a good indie film go for Boy In Stripped Pajamas.",1238371200,,1773,4.101744186046512
3704693,5,B001N26GFC,"In a time when more and more film makers tackle increasingly darker subject matter, Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky takes a unique approach by presenting familiar themes through the eyes of someone who is almost perpetually happy. Poppy, magnificently portrayed by Sally Hawkins, is a very outgoing young school teacher who, after having her bike stolen, decides she is in need of driving lessons. As it turns out her driving instructor Scott, played by Eddie Marsan, happens to be the complete antithesis of his new pupil. The film centers around similar interactions Poppy has with various characters, like her roommate, sisters, students, and in particularly her weekly driving lessons with Scott. Though some may find Poppy over the top or just plain annoying at times, she embodies many characteristics too often absent in today's society. She is comfortable with herself no matter what others think and gives without over analyzing her actions. That being said, Poppy may seem like a character gliding chaotically through life. However, the more we see the more we realize that Poppy is far more in control of her life than most. Happy-Go-Lucky is a film about learning to greet life, even its darker aspects, with optimism as opposed to the all the often pessimistic views of today. This is not an easy film to make and Mike Leigh should be commended for giving the role of Poppy to Sally Hawkins, who completely owns it. Comedic performances are often overlooked, though Hawkins' performance should be met with a level of enthusiasm matching anything seen this year.",1237939200,,1570,5.089147286821706
3704694,3,B001N26GFC,"I was rather disappointed in the movie overall.  The bits and pieces that are used to create the movie trailer were in fact the best parts of the film.  Sadly, there was so much potential to make this movie into something magnificent, but it just faltered.  I would have thought it would have been better to see someone in their early 20's with Poppy's attitude.  When I learn that she is now 30 and acting so immature, it really makes the film less credible.  I would highly recommend folks rent the movie before buying this.  It was not the best $20 investment that I ever made.",1237852800,,580,4.4245283018867925
3704695,4,B001N26GFC,"I've never heard so much gripping and moaning as I did the day the Oscar nominations were announced and Sally Hawkins was snubbed the Best Actress nomination.  She had been labeled the front runner even though everyone and their mother knew that no one outside of Streep had a remote chance of stealing Winslet's much deserved Oscar away, but still, Hawkins stamp in the awards race was too large to ignore.  She swept the precursors, winning almost every actress award imaginable and so when she was denied even a nomination come Oscar morning it was not only odd, it was shameful.

Even though I would have still handed the Oscar to Winslet, the fact that Hawkins was snubbed rubs me wrong as well.

After having watched this delightful little film a few times now I can honestly say, that while the film may not be as deep or even as eventful as I would have hoped, it is far from the shallow farce many have labeled it.  I understand that Hawkins' performance will not be deemed a masterpiece by all, and those who label her nothing more than annoying and aggravating are not entirely wrong in their conclusion and thus I cannot fault them.  Her performance is not for everyone, but one has to be able to look at the achievement apart from the character and realize that she single handedly CREATED this character from the ground up; and despite all of Poppy's manic mannerisms and her annoyingly delightful demeanor there is a sadness that lurks in the quiet moments (that scene with the bum just wrecked me) and Hawkins marvelously unveils that for us.

The film seems to be void of any real plot.  Poppy is an eccentric school teacher (I really wish I were in her class) who decides it's about time she learns to drive.  She takes lessons every Saturday from Scott, an angry and controlling man who may or may not have a thing for Poppy despite his apparent annoyance with her cheeriness.  That's really it.  There is a side plot involving an unruly student and a counselor who happens to strike Poppy's fancy, but aside from that the main focus of the film is Poppy's driving lessons.  It's within these lessons that we get to the heart of Leigh's script, that interaction between someone incessantly optimistic and someone who is a stark contrast; direly pessimistic.

I wish that the rest of the cast, namely Eddie Marsan, could have stood up to Hawkins brilliance but sadly she is the only shining light here.  Marsan couldn't embrace his character the way I wanted him to and he just came off as rather caricaturist and hammy.  This is a true testament to Hawkins' talent, for her character had all the makings of a caricature but instead she reigns it all in to create someone truly three dimensional and pure.

I would have liked to have seen a little more out of the script, which could have easily embellished on the root of Poppy's spirit with a little more intelligence.  It leaves gateways for the audience to understand her, but in the end it only satisfies our curiosity minimally in my personal opinion.  The final confrontation scene with Scott is very enlightening and it makes me wish that there had been a little more of that form of tension or confrontation in the film.  It is almost too chipper at times, thus taking away from the emotional heart of the story.

In the end `Happy-go-Lucky' is very lucky that it has such a happy star, really, for Hawkins carries this film on her back and makes for one truly delightful experience.  It could have been better had it focused a little more on the core of Poppy herself, but as far as comedic fare goes, there are few that are this rewarding.",1237766400,,3618,4.595645412130637
3704696,1,B001N26GFC,"I am stunned that so many movie critics - and doubtlessly many viewers - thought very highly of this boring and fairly shallow movie, so much so I am even more worried now about my fellow man. The relatively few critics that disliked this offering of time wasting as much as I tended to give the explanation that the enjoyment or not of the film depends on whether or not you like the continuously bubbly main character Poppy. I found her constant witless, even clownish cheerfulness on top of a dull script to be a constant irritant and not even credible. Not that she was not an attractive, good-hearted person, it's that her pointless bubbly behavior being constant just gets tiresome. It doesn't have the charm and purpose of say, the ever high spirits of Amelie in that charming film of the same name. But even assuming that this ever cheerful giggle clown could be lovable to someone I don't see how that could compensate for the film's mostly dull and shallow script.

The first few scenes were not just humorless, they were painfully bad and after waiting in pain for nearly an hour to see some redeeming change I had to turn it off. I was supposed to love this character? If I had been her driving instructor in the film I would have dumped this childish, irresponsible, inattentive clown after lesson 2.

For the most part I loved the character of Poppy, she's always in a good mood trying to make other people's days better and live the life she wanted. At some points I did think she could stop talking if only for a few minutes though. Most of the time she was pretty funny, I'll admit.

I loved the tension between her and her driving instructor Scott, they are complete opposites. Poppy pushed Scott's buttons the whole time and got a great laugh out of it. I also loved the scenes between Poppy and her flatmate Zoe, you could tell they were great friends.

There was one rather strange scene that didn't really fit with the rest of the movie though, it was only during the special features that it made any sort of sense to me, I found that scene unnecessary. The ending I felt was rather rushed, it just kind of ending when I personally thought there was a bit of unfinished business that need to be dealt with.

All in all this was a sweet quirky movie that definitely deserves a viewing.",1237420800,,1114,4.270142180094787

If Debbie Downer were bi-polar, her opposite half might well be peppy ""Poppy,"" a perpetually upbeat thirty-year-old elementary school teacher whom no vicissitude of life could ever hope to faze.  Poppy seems utterly impervious to either hard times or bad news as she giggles and chortles her way around London, going to work, hanging out with her buddies, or taking driving lessons from a stuffy, humorless instructor who may be developing a more-than-professional interest in his client.

In terms of structure, Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" has an aimlessness and a formlessness that is both the movie's greatest asset and its most problematic weakness.  This approach does make the story feel less contrived and more realistic, but it also robs the movie of some of the cohesion, drama and emotional power it might have had had it been more formally designed.

In a similar way, Sally Hawkins has been assigned the extraordinarily challenging task of bringing an aura of likeability to a character who, if you met her in real life, would probably drive you straight over the edge after a mere five minutes in her presence.  Luckily, Hawkins is largely successful in toning down at least some of Poppy`s more egregiously irritating mannerisms, and in the rare moments when the character is allowed to actually behave like an honest-to-God grownup woman, Hawkins wins us over completely.  Eddie Marsan also scores big as the rage-filled, uptight driving instructor who, in a wonderfully explosive scene that is the verbal equivalent of a slap in the face, finally confronts Poppy with a few unattractive truths about herself.

It's nice to come across a character who isn't all depressed and angst-ridden about life for a change, and Poppy certainly seems to have found a niche in the world that works for her.  That's a rare enough thing in movies these days to make ""Happy-Go-Lucky,"" flaws and all, worth checking out.",1237075200,,1929,5.079113924050633
3704699,5,B001N26GFC,"Fun, bubbly and really enjoyable.  Sally Hawkins just owns this role!  A wonderful performance and a kind of movie that is just rare, wild and crazy fun!

Director and writer Mike Leigh returns with ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" and with his cool and non-traditional approach in movie making, the film benefits from the talent just becoming as one with their character and the fact that the actors themselves didn't know what they were getting into, you get a unique style of film that may not have a major plot per se, but it's more of how one woman's attitude and behavior affects the people around her.

The film is about Poppy (Sally Hawkins), her way of looking at life is rather bubbly, always happy, optimistic, cracking jokes with a tinge of perverted humor.  Rarely is she down in the dumps because of her cheery and happy attitude.  And because she emits this attitude, some may interpret it as freaky (because she keeps talking and cracking jokes) but for those who know her, there is a sense of comfort to have her near them.

The main storyline is about the people that Poppy knows, some really well and some not well at all and how they react around her.

Her best friend Zoe, who she has lived with for ten years, has a good friendship with Poppy and both are school teachers.  Zoe is a bit more of a realist but both managed to have fun in their single lives.

Throughout the film, you see Poppy learn the Flamenco, go to a chiropractor for her aching back, trying to befriend a homeless man, trying to meet an employee at the bookstore, meeting up with family, trying to find out why a bully in class is beating up kids.  And each person she comes across, she gives them a dose of her personality.

But she meets her challenge when she goes through driver's training and encounters a frumpy, closed-minded racist who happens to be her driver's instructor.  But for Poppy, what becomes a session of paying for driver's lessons, she looks at the opportunity to try to bring some sunshine to his life or at least get him to open up.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is presented in Widescreen (2:35:1).  What I enjoyed about this film is that there are so many locations shot throughout London.  May it be shopping, going to a club, going out on a date, driving lessons, Flamenco lessons, etc.  So, you get a good does of color.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.  There is use of music as well but mostly front channel usage on your home theater system.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are three special features included on the DVD for ""Happy-Go-Lucky"". Included are:

  * Behind the Wheel of Happy-Go-Lucky - A five minute featurette featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the driving instruction parts of the film.  Seven cameras used and how they were shot.
  * Happy-in-Character - A Half hour long featurette with interviews with director Mike Leigh, Sally Hawkins (Poppy), Alexis Zegerman (Zoe) and Eddie Marsan (Scott).  This was very interesting because you learn about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he wanted the talent to become the character.  And how the film was just built overtime.  A style of filmmaking of keeping the talent out in the dark but enough for them to learn about their roles and be in character.  In fact, almost with no definitive script, the talent just knew about their characters and not so much about the overall storyline since it was written as the film progressed.  Thus, for the driving instructions, Eddie Marsan's thought his character was about a racist, depressed and dark driver's instructor and thought maybe it would be like ""Taxi Driver"" but when paired with the character of Poppy and her bubbly attitude and her constant bubbliness and jokes, he was shocked and realized that director Mike Leigh had something interesting in store for the film.
  * Audio Commentary by Director Mike Leigh - Mike Leigh talks about working with the talent and how fortunate he had Sally Hawkins to play Poppy.  Also, Leigh talks about how shots were done via a crane and sets up certain scenes and introducing people to certain British comments and helping the viewer understand the terminology such as ""Out for Tea"" which means ""Supper"".  There are a few periods of no commentary but overall an informative commentary.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I first watched the film, I was thinking ""Seinfeld"".  Mainly because I found myself wondering where was the story going.  Was this a film about nothing but yet still manages to be hilarious?

All I was seeing was Poppy interacting with all these people.  But I realized that this was the basis of the film.  Not a storyline about going from point A to point B, it was a story about interactions and how people are touched or were annoyed by Poppy's character.

And after watching the special features and learning about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he really didn't tell the talent about what the storyline was about and learning how much was improvised, you start to realize how special this film was.  From Sally Hawkins portraying Poppy, that was just amazing.  And just the back-and-forth lightning quick banter between Eddie Marsan's Scott and Hawkins Poppy during the driving instructions, I'm not sure how much of that was improvised but that was just brilliant acting.

The film was a nice surprise.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and in the end, you are left with many memories and visual images of Poppy and to make a film based on character interactions with no overall plot but basically a typical days in the life of Poppy, the film was quite unique and refreshing.

I was a little surprised though by the 80's fashion and at first I was wondering if the film was taking place in the late 80's or early 90's because I never expected to see acid wash jeans in a film ever again but with the talk of texting and Playstations, you realize this is a modern film.  In fact, in one of the featurettes, Marsan talks about utilizing late 80's fashion for his character.

But overall, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" was an enjoyable and an all-out fun film made believable by the wonderful performances by both Hawkins and Marsan.

If you are up for something different than the norm, definitely give ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" a try.",1236470400,,6301,4.738292011019284
3704700,5,B001N26GFC,"This is all about Poppy, played by Sally Hawkins.  Single in London.  Positive, cheerful, and generally embodies the title of the movie.  Every situation is to be faced with good spirit, a light attitude, and cheer.

At the beginning it seems that she will overrun a challenge like a tank running over a building in a WW II flick.  Smiles.  Banter.  Humor.  Irrepressible.  Even when alone.

The challenges grow.  A problem student.  A vagrant in a deserted part of town.  A doctor visit.  A dance instructor with issues.

And then the new champion for Driving Instructor From Satan, played by Eddie Marsan.  These scenes are classics.  As in many movies confrontation is important to good comedy or drama.  The theater I saw this in was laughing its collective heads off.  The driving lessons make me smile even as I type this.

How Poppy reacts to each challenge - and how others react to Poppy - is the core of this movie.  The plot is mostly a string of episodes.  Mike Leigh does an outstanding job directing, finding a second level to each situation.  Funny and happy.  But also thoughtful and a little gritty.

She bubbles away with jokes and giggles in the tryingest situations. Say, she comes out of Camden Market and finds her bicycle stolen. Most people would burst out into the darkest curses. Not Poppy. She shrugs, regrets that she couldn't even say goodbye to the thing, walks home, and decides to learn driving a car. Which leads to some dark encounters with a manic driving instructor. These are the tuffest moments in a mostly sunny story. Maybe I should also mention her otherworldly dialogue with the deranged homeless man.

Apart from her jolly good humor, which can be hard to swallow for some (including some reviewers), she is a genius in empathy. Nobody could be better suited for a teaching job.
I had to make up my mind whether I love her or loath her. My daughter instructed me to love her. Ok, I loved her.
The nice little movie even has a hint of an happy end, when she finally meets a nice guy and it seems to start well. Good for her.

Instead, she sails on through in bright colors, chunky heels, and an unsinkably happy outlook. Even her response to a painful chiropractic crunch is to laugh at it. If you can imagine Annie Hall in short skirts and brilliant hues, you've got Poppy's attire nailed - always wrestling at least one oversized bag, lots of bits and pieces flapping in the breeze.

A few things save this from silly pointlessness. Rather than simple mania, Poppy's bright view of the world is a choice, one that she maintains with effort that rarely shows. The effort does come out, once in a while, though, like when she deals with that troubled child in her class, wound-too-tight sister, homeless man, or stalker. They cut to her serious core - but, if wounds healed the way blows to Poppy's optimism do, most emergency rooms would shut down for lack of business.

I could have wished for a little more closure regarding that troubled child. And, more than once, Poppy crossed the line into genuinely annoying - but only occasionally, and she's pathologically forgivable. On the whole, it's a fun if forgettable bit of fluff.

3704707,4,B001N26GFC,"If you've never seen a film by British director Mike Leigh before, ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" might be the perfect choice for you.

Leigh makes films in a fairly unique way. He gathers a group of unknown actors, provides them with an outline, and watches the group as they begin to improvise their lines and work out the situations. In this way, he is able to capture dialogue and situations, which seem real because the actors are interjecting their own personalities and backgrounds into the roles. Even though he tends to work with unknown actors, actors in his films have gone on to lengthy and prolific careers and he has also re-teamed with people after they have made a name for themselves. Jim Broadbent and Timothy Spall stand out as good examples of the Leigh School. His film ""Vera Drake"" introduced Imelda Staunton, a little known British actress to the world and she has since appeared in a number of films, including one of the ""Harry Potter"" films and ""Freedom Writers"". Generally, Leigh's films are about the British lower class, people struggling very hard to just scrape by. Because of this, his films tend to be depressing showing a group of people on the brink of emotional and financial collapse. They are well made, but the subject matter is usually a bit of a downer. So, when he makes films like ""Topsy-Turvy"", his biopic about Gilbert and Sullivan, and now ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", they show the true breadth of his skill.

Poppy (Sally Hawkins, ""Cassandra's Dream"", ""Vera Drake"", ""All or Nothing"") is a young woman living with her younger sister and a friend in a small flat. She has a good job (teaching kindergarten students), a good group of friends and co-workers and a very positive outlook on life. When she leaves a bookstore and realizes her bike has been stolen, rather than get depressed and mad, she decides to get some driving lessons, to make the fateful plunge. Her driving instructor, Scott (Eddie Marsan, ""Mission Impossible III"", ""Vera Drake"", ""V for Vendetta"", ""Miami Vice"") is a very angry man and this anger is so completely at odds with Poppy's outlook that she considers it more of a challenge than anything else. As their lessons continue, the duo gets more and more frustrated with each other taking their relationship to new places. At the same time, Poppy realizes one of her students may be acting out due to abuse and calls in a counselor. Tim (Samuel Roukin) arrives and begins to get to the heart of the matter. But he also wants to get to know Poppy better and they set up a date.

Because Leigh lets his actors work out the dialogue and reactions through improvisation, capturing the best and most truthful bits of their exercises, his films have a real air of authenticity about them. Much of what the actors say appears to be coming from a place in their subconscious, or their history, allowing the actors to give their characters a large chunk of their own personal history.

This style of filmmaking seems especially relevant in the interactions between Poppy and Scott, and this becomes the spine of the film. Scott seems to take an almost instant dislike to Poppy; she is so completely what he isn't. He is serious, angry and very, very professional. She is happy, ready and willing to joke and takes little seriously and seems only out to have a good time. As soon as she enters his car, he comments about the boots she is wearing, and how they can't provide her with the control she needs to operate an automobile. He insists she wear more sensible shoes for their next lesson. But Poppy jokes about how good they make her look and seems to barely hear him. As their lessons continue, and Scott becomes angrier and angrier, Poppy seems to view his attitude as a challenge and tries to get to the heart of the matter, to find out what happened in his life to make him so angry and bitter. Scott isn't stupid and although some of her questions clearly cut deep, causing him to pause for a moment, he just becomes angrier and more persistent.

Sally Hawkins is very good as Poppy. There appears to be nothing that will get this woman into a bad mood. When she finds her bike is missing, she is merely sad because she wasn't able to say goodbye. A surly bookstore clerk fails to ruin her day. And when she becomes concerned about a pupil, she is naturally concerned, but also hopeful that she and her colleagues can help the young boy out. In fact, Poppy is so happy and upbeat, she almost becomes annoying. Hawkins walks a very fine line, very fine, between an interesting, unique character and the type of person who just seems annoying, making most normal people cringe with the first word.

But as I watched the film, I got used to Poppy. I realized part of my annoyance with her character was that I am not used to people like her. Most people in my life, most people that I know of, have down times, moody times, and I know of very few people who are happy all the time. So, when Hawkins paints Poppy as such a positive, upbeat person, it is a little hard to bear at first. Poppy defends her life, stating she's got a good job, a great group of friends, nice family. Things could be better, things could be worse. She is just uncommonly upbeat and her friends seem to really enjoy being with her and around her.

Eddie Marsan is also very good as Scott. Scott is complicated and it will take more than a little prodding for Poppy to be able to work her magic. But she thinks she is up for the challenge. His performance is so good because he proves to be more than Poppy's equal. If she is overly happy and overly upbeat, Scott wears all of the years of disappointment on his face, all of the trials appear every time his eyes swerve towards Poppy. He shows so much emotion, but also seems to change his feelings on the turn of a dime. Initially, he is all business, but as soon as Poppy gets in his car, he is annoyed at her lack of preparation and attention to detail. As Poppy tries to get him to loosen up, there seems to be a moment when he considers this, his facial features seem to lighten a little. Then he realizes this is a woman who is probably like all of the other women who have wronged him and he returns to his previous, stern persona. With each of their encounters, Scott seems more on the edge of letting go, which makes him all the more determined to remain steadfast and bitter. And this serves to make Poppy all the more determined to try to help Scott, to get to the heart of the matter.

The dynamic between Poppy and Scott is what makes the film so interesting. We have very few examples of two characters meeting and interacting in such a unique and interesting way. As we watch them interact we feel like we are watching two real people as they deal with their own problems.

There is a less successful attempt to introduce another such character into Poppy's life; she attends a Flamenco dance class with her school's head master and the teacher is suitably eccentric, suitably wild and emotional. But this character isn't as fleshed out as Scott and the relationship and the dance instructor seem more like caricatures.

Towards the end of the film, Poppy meets Tim (Samuel Roukin) and their budding relationship adds a nice touch and proves that Poppy has many reasons to be so ""Happy-Go-Lucky"".",1225584000,,7277,4.556574923547401
3704708,3,B001N26GFC,"Happy-Go-Lucky chronicles several days in the life of Poppy (Sally Hawkins), an intensely cheerful London primary school teacher. As she takes driving lessons from a bitter instructor (Eddie Marsan), attends a Flamenco class, parties with her roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman), tends to a troubled student, and visits her married sister Helen (Caroline Martin), her irrepressibly sunny disposition affords her both happiness and a few unexpected confrontations.

The authentic performances director Mike Leigh coaxes from his always talented cast is easily the most impressive thing behind his latest dramedy. However, the characters themselves are often so depressingly enthusiastic that the heavy realism between their conversations is lost to their ability to annoy general audiences not accustomed to such presumably unrealistic personas. Undoubtedly people like Sally Hawkins' Poppy do exist - but watching them in a film is not nearly as much fun as mocking them in real life.

And real life is a subject closely examined in Happy-Go-Lucky. Constant attempts at realism are evident, especially in the way Leigh directs his actors - starting without a script, having the characters only ever interact with others as they would in the world of the story, and keeping the actors ignorant of any of the plot elements outside of what their characters would know about. And yet with all of the so-called realism, much of it is too hard to buy. Poppy's ability to shut out all of the negative influences on her permanently cheery disposition is commendable, but when she arrives in potentially dangerous situations, it borders on simplemindedness. Fear for wellbeing is something Poppy's chipper attitude doesn't account for, though it does provide a wide spectrum of her unbiased tolerance to all.

Poppy's character is an infinitely intriguing one as her extreme enthusiasm and optimism rarely affects others in a predictable way. A bookstore clerk seems perpetually annoyed, a social worker charmed, her sister Helen reacts jealously, and her chiding taunts and jokes to the pessimistic Scott causes anything but the desired effect. Even with several negative responses to her delighted demeanor, she never allows such criticism to change her outlook on life and her accomplishments. In this world of eccentric characters that Mike Leigh has created, perhaps Poppy is the most normal of them all.

3704709,4,B001N26GFC,"HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is one of those quirky British films that won't be remembered as one of the best you've ever seen, but is worth a look and four stars because, as I said to my wife after our advance screening, it ""has its 5-star moments"".

The protagonist is Poppy (Sally Hawkins), a frenetically happy, 30-year old, primary school teacher living in London's northern reaches with her roommate Zoe (Alexis Zegerman). Poppy's good humor is so inexorable that, while it serves her well with her young charges, it often abrades the patience of adults. Only Zoe is imperturbable.

As with other films of the genre (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Local-Hero/dp/6305558205/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Local Hero</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty/dp/6305622914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calendar-Girls/dp/B0001I55M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calendar Girls</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waking-Ned-Devine/dp/B00000ILEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waking Ned Devine</a>), the plot revolves not so much around events as the personalities and eccentricities of the players.

The single best overall performance is perhaps that by Eddie Marsan as the scarily intense Scott, Poppy's driving instructor, whose deep-seated, smoldering anger at the world reflects a tightly wound mental state 180 degrees opposite that of his student. Confined together in the small space of Scott's car, an explosion seems always but a hair-trigger's pull away.

Definitely, the single best scene, the one that had the audience in stitches, is played by Karina Fernandez as a Flamenco teacher, when she attempts to describe to and inculcate in her class of adult students the passion necessary for the dance. Talk about meltdown!

The conflict, if it can be called such, of the story comes as Poppy's happy-go-luckiness scrapes up against the unhappy lives and internal turmoil of others: the mentally unstable derelict she encounters under a bridge in a bleak industrial section of the city, her pregnant and subliminally unhappy younger sister, a bullying and disturbed boy in her class, and, above all, Scott. As the last scene fades into the film credits, the viewer is left wondering if Poppy's felicitous worldview will survive life. One suspects it will.",1223078400,,2455,6.495412844036697

If you don't like the movie most likely you are missing the point that it is about Poppy,  her philosophy on life that isn't necessarily wrapped up neatly and settled at the end, although I feel it was.  Eddie Marsan as ""Scott"" the Angry Driving Instructor was priceless, and deserved his BIFA award for best supporting actor.  His performance is nothing short of impressive and breathless.  Very early on Poppy links his anger problems with her student that's been bullying other students in her classroom.  Poppy's optimism does indeed nearly get her into some tricky situations, but she insists on rising above them in her own shrug and carry on way.  At the same time people DO hang on quite stubbornly to their anger, and whatever issues brought them there.  Sally Hawkins plays Poppy impeccably, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would gladly see it again.",1519948800,,938,4.81875
