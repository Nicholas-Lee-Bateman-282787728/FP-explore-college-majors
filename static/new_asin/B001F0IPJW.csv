8300139,1,B001F0IPJW,Just ditto-ing the previous reviews because they nail it. Nothing to add other than the host ruined it.,1483747200,,103,4.777777777777778
8300140,1,B001F0IPJW,"This could have been a great show, but the host-who also wrote and presented-is just too much, in a bad way. His sarcastic remarks and attempts at comedy were very much out of place and not appreciated. He is extraordinarily annoying. It got so bad, I watched it with the sound off for the last third.

Steer clear of this one.",1418342400,2,327,4.360655737704918
8300141,2,B001F0IPJW,"I would never have believed it possible for a travel video about Tuscany to actually deride the great city of Florence. But this one does! Maybe host/writer John Guerrasio is of Sienese descent, and centuries of rivalry color his opinion, but I was very put off by his open disdain for Florence. Yes, the Chianti countryside is marvelous (I've stayed there myself). But the beauty of Tuscany stands by itself magnificently without having to resort to denigrating its main city.

This video shows remarkable places to visit, and is very nice to look at, but it's a case of the host making it too much about himself. His lame jokes seem awkward and flippant. His attempts to convey the sensations of Tuscany lack descriptive depth. For a supposed ""food critic,"" he was at a surprising loss for adjectives when describing the wines he tasted.

Sadly, he truly phoned this one in. This could have been a very good program with a host who was more reverential, more eloquent and less obtrusive. John, the viewers want to see Tuscany. Not you.

There are many good videos about Tuscany available. This is not one of them.",1273449600,6,1115,4.737113402061856
