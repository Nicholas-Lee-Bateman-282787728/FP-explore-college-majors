8068365,4,B0009WIDYO,I found this instructional dance video very helpful when I was first learning cha-cha.  Recommended for beginners just starting with classes.,1399248000,,141,5.714285714285714
8068366,5,B0009WIDYO,"This product arrived faster than I expected. All lessons are easy and can be followed easily as their ads. This product is by far better than the private lessons which cost more but not effective at all.
I love Dance by Vicki Regan and would recommend it to anyone who do not know how to dance BUT want to dance well.
Happy, happy",1380758400,,330,4.253968253968254
8068367,4,B0009WIDYO,This DVD is great for a beginner.  The instruction is crystal clear and there are no distracting set designs or fancy costumes.  The indroduction is a little corny though but the instructors are very encouraging and positive.  I recommend this for anyone who wants to concentrate on the basics of Cha-Cha.,1220140800,,305,4.9411764705882355
8068368,4,B0009WIDYO,"I am one of those who have 2 left feet and just could not learn how to dance.  With Vioki and her partner, I found I could actually do the cha-cha.  I learned to do the turns in time with the music- something that I could not do before with the dance instructions that I have.  Vicki's method works for me.",1125619200,4,306,3.9836065573770494
8068369,3,B0009WIDYO,"If You Can Dance Cha-Cha promises you can watch the DVD (and practice with) the instructors in the day and go dancing by night, it isn't telling a lie. The basics of the cha-cha step are taught in the easiest way I've seen. It's designed so you can work along with the footage, like attending a class, complete with repetitions and much praise from your teachers for the wonderful work you've done. Vicky Regan also tells you the hip swaying trick to get that Latin flavor into your dance. Along with her young partner, Ron De Vito, you really do learn the cha-cha in no time.

But here's where the descriptions are misleading. ""You'll start with the basics, then work your way up to combinations..."" sounds a lot like you'll have choreographed patterns under your belt by the end of it. What you really get is only, and only what is considered absolutely basic to cha-cha. That is, the basic step, a cross over and open breaks step which is quite signature to cha-cha, an underarm turn and a solo turn. So, sure you'll be able to do the cha-cha, but all you'll be dancing is 4 steps again and again and again. While you do certainly have a chance to master the basic step, ""learning all of the creative variations"" isn't possible because there aren't any. The steps are standard and too few. But the teaching is undoubtedly effective.

If you're an absolute and utter beginner, this DVD will give you the basics. If you know the basics and want some patterns, look elsewhere. What would have made it a balanced, value-for-money buy would have been if the DVD had about 10 combinations. Not difficult to do either. Even if they'd just been clearly demonstrated at a faster pace, it would have been worthwhile.",1123632000,24,1709,4.6
8068370,3,B0009WIDYO,"I started taking dance lessons several months ago and the
Cha-Cha was one of the dances being taught. I didn't want to wait to learn this dance so I decided I'd get the tape beforehand to get a head start.
The video was very good in terms of teaching the basic steps and moves. Probably too much time was spent practicing each step but I also feel the same way about my dance instructor, some people in our class do need the constant repetition but I would prefer more moves being taught.
Much cheaper than dance lessons, just wish they had an intermediate and advanced tape as well to learn additional moves.
The Rumba tape was also good to learn by.",1028851200,5,651,4.3884297520661155
8068371,4,B0009WIDYO,"I watched this tape after taking  about 4 hours of private lessons on Cha-Cha.  It helped me better understand the basics of  the Cha-Cha. I also have a ""You Can Dance: Mambo"" tape by Vicki Regan.  On both  tapes, her insturction is well planned and  structured for  a  beginner.  Steps are explained and demonstrated clearly.  If one's intention is  to  learn the fundamentals and go out and dance,  the tape is very helpful.  However, there is not much help on styling and details of  the dance.  Therfore, for improving on the dance you either need to take classes or  wait for the advanced version of the tape - if it ever becomes available.",961200000,26,645,4.566371681415929
