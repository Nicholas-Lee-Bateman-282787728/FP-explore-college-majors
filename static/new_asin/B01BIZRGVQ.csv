7657336,5,B01BIZRGVQ,"This is a great documentary to have a brief understanding of world's largest civic/social movement, Hizmet Movement. But I would encourage everyone to meet with the Hizmet people in their local communities. If there are Turkic Americans in your city, who are so dedicated for peace, dialogue, education, social justice, I can say that they are most probably Hizmet volunteers inspired by the teachings of Fethullah Gulen. I hope the producers will have more projects to tell the stories of Hizmet volunteers, especially in a world we hear violence, hate speech, discrimination more than anything. We need to tell good stories to inspire others! Love is a ""verb"" so it needs action. If you like the documentary, do something good for others today!",1458086400,5,746,5.073170731707317
7657337,5,B01BIZRGVQ,"I had the pleasure of watching this documentary when i was in Turkey. Not long after i had another chance to watch it in Chicago at the AMC theatre with a few of my friends from my university.
What Love is a Verb and the Hizmet movement talk about and showcase is inspiring and monumental in terms of exhibiting the beauty of dialogue. I encourage anyone with an open mind to watch this amazing documentary as it covers the movements activities in Northern Iraq, Somalia and my home country of Bosnia!",1458000000,4,501,4.516483516483516
7657338,5,B01BIZRGVQ,I watched the movie during one of its gala previews in Florida. It is emotionally moving movie and helps to understand how a civic social movement can make a difference in the world especially when we needed the most.,1458000000,7,217,4.589743589743589
7657339,5,B01BIZRGVQ,"I have watched this one during its Gala. As the title,""Love is A Verb"", implies the people who inspired by Mr. Gulen really turned their love in action across the globe. I was so moved up and inspired by the movie. This is also a very timely movie to understand whether Muslims love or ""hate us"" as put forward by one of the front-runner presidential candidates (you know who he is:)",1458000000,5,383,4.408450704225352
7657340,5,B01BIZRGVQ,"I have been to a screening of this documentary in New York last year. An Iraqi Kurdish woman engineer who defeats patriarchal stereotypes, a doctor lady in Somalia helping people in refugee camps, a musical ensemble with Muslim and Christian kids in Bosnia, building schools despite ongoing warfare are some of the highlights for me. The lovely girl on the DVD cover might become a famous scientist one day. Terry and Stephan's work in directing and visuals are great. If you are sick and tired of the xenophobia going on in the political debates and in the media, this film will give you some fresh air.",1458000000,6,604,4.7075471698113205
8750342,3,B01BIZRGVQ,"About a Turkish man who advocates Islam through the use of building schools and hospitals. Since he ALSO ADVOCATES DEMOCRACY (!) (HORRORS!!) he is PUBLIC ENEMY #1 in Turkey! People from around the world sing his praises and woman with colorful head coverings share the beneficial impact he has had on their lives. A Catholic man had no problem bowing down at a worship center while praying (?).

The man has been invited to return home, he has declined as he feels he can worship and practice his faith in the comfort of the United States where there is the Bill of Rights: Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Religion, and Freedom to Gather, none of these are guaranteed in Turkey. Enjoy your stay and good luck with spreading the Gospel of Allah across the globe!",1536796800,,759,4.622222222222222
8750343,5,B01BIZRGVQ,"I've learnt that the Hizmet Movement people; message of deep and practiced faith, altruism and action was being delivered against a backdrop of poverty, corruption and moral decay.
