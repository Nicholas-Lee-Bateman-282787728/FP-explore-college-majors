8280515,3,B001AZI1OG,"This is an interesting exploration in solving the ancient mystery of the sinking of Atlantis.  What happened to the European's first civilization , the Minoans on the island of Crete?  Why they disappeared and what had happened?

This DVD entertained and discounted from volcano eruption to Greek invaders.  From the sandy beach,  archeologist Sandy MacGillivray dug up some sea shells and other deep sea organism with the assumption of a massive tsunami with a computer simulation.

Sinking Atlantis!? Believe it or not?",1332115200,,521,5.2926829268292686
8280516,3,B001AZI1OG,"""Sinking Atlantis"" is an interesting program exploring the end of the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete (which a few scholars have linked to Plato's ""Atlantis,"" thus explaining the title).  It has long been assumed that some sort of disaster or catastrophe precipitated its fall, perhaps an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, and this program stakes its claim on the latter - placing the blame on the Thera eruption, which occurred around 1600 BCE.

An analysis of the 2004 earthquake and resulting deadly tidal waves that wrecked Sri Lanka is made, and experts are consulted to compare what happened in that disaster to the still-remaining evidence that can be found on Crete.  Could a massive wave or waves have pummelled Crete, to the point that the Minoans were never able to recover their former glory?  Perhaps.  Through field trips to various parts of the island, archaeologists make the case that such a scenario was likely.

A few items were left unanswered or unexplored, however.  For example: the program shows the archaeologists visiting several sites on Crete to search for evidence of their theory (which they find), but, it would have been interesting to see if their theory held up when searching nearby islands in the Mediterranean.  If their hypothesis was true, one would think they'd be able to find proof throughout the region, not just on Crete.  Finding similar evidence in other areas would bolster their case immensely.

Three stars.  Some interesting detective work on the fall of the Minoans, but more probably needs to be done before we can definitively close the book.",1327795200,,1607,5.026415094339622
8280517,3,B001AZI1OG,"This dvd should have been titled Minoan Apocalypse.  The geological and archaeological approaches to figuring out why the Minoan civilization suddenly collapsed is sound and very interesting.  The methods for figuring out this mystery are very detailed, yet explained in ways the layperson can easily understand.  However, there is very little in Sinking Atlantis about why archaeologists think Minoan civilization was the mythical Lost Continent of Atlantis.  In fact, the myth of Atlantis is only casually mentioned about 2 minutes before the end of the video.  There are better videos out there that address the Minoan connection to Atlantis. As a professional archaeologist, I would recommend the Minotaur's Island, several National Geographic documentaries, and even a couple sensationalized A&E/History Channel/TLC productions that treat the possibility that the Minoans were the Atlanteans much more thoroughly. However, this video is very useful if you are interested in seeing what Minoan Civilization was like and seeing how archaeologists use science to make sense of the past.",1306195200,7,1088,5.6503067484662575
8280518,4,B001AZI1OG,"Ok. This film once again uses the Thera Theory for the demise of the Minoans. It pretty much proves there was significant ash fall near and around the island and that there is significant evidence for a tsunami. It does fall short in three ways though. One, the presenter states CONCLUSIVELY that Linear A has been deciphered and that it was an Indo-Iranian language, which although a theory is in no way accepted by the majority of academia and quite frankly does not make a lot of sense based on the placenames and words that we do understand. Also, recent DNA evidence shows the Minoans coming from Cilicia and being Anatolian in origin. Linear A does not seem to be a Luwian-Hittite language though. Second, the presenter does nothing in terms of accounting what was going on on Crete between 1600 and 1450, when the Mycenaeans rebuilt Knossos. One hundred and fifty years is a long period of time. The presenter also makes the assunption that just because ONE piece of evidence exists for cannibalism on Crete that the practice was common amongst the MINOAN people. Thats like saying that if an archaeologist 5000 years from now found evidence in the strata of a town of a mass serial murder that all of American society were serial killers. In short, the film presents some interesting evidence for a catastrophic event, but makes some seriously misleading statements and assumptions about Minoan culture.",1226534400,17,1411,4.858921161825726
