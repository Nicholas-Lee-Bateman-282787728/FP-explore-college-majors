1353498,5,B00004U1F9,"Here exists one of the few films of this past year that truly lives up to its ambitiousness. Rather than branching out into weaker (and equally  pretentious) limbs of personal philosophy, Hirokazu has chosen instead to  produce an endearing and fantastically human snapshot of would-be, could-be  existence.
Barring the need for such extravagances as special effects,  the film opts rather to move into a profoundly simple form, as though  computerized editing techniques would not do the story, much less its  characters, justice.
Moreso, the style in which the script was derived is  in itself quite a feat. As described by the Boston Phoenix, Hirokazu took  it upon himself to poll 500 japanese citizens, most of whom elderly, asking  them to provide the one most wonderous and profound memory that they could.  Seamlessly blending this with the cosmic implications of the rest of the  film, the experience begins to take on new dimensions. Ultimately one finds  the need to kick oneself from time to time, pinch one's own cheek, and  remember that the bulk of this is real, despite its purgatorial, and at  times, super-existential, feel.
The premise runs as such: men and women  after death make their way to a waystation of sorts between life and  eternity, and are requested to provide one memory. This memory being all  that they remember on into infinity, it is something of a monumentous  decision, and as is to be expected, some have difficulty doing so. It is  thus these few, who after one week's stay are still unable to choose, that  go on to become the staff at said waystation, aiding and interviewing those  who pass through.
Highly recommended to anyone fascinated by a perhaps  not altogether contrived view of time spent after death. I, myself, an  atheist, still found something magical in it, so perhaps those who commit  to a particular belief will see something even more mystical in its depths.",966902400,2,1920,4.946708463949843

Anyone who won't watch foreign films just because of subtitles is missing the  movie watching experience of a life time.  The movie is well put thought  out, wonderfully filmed, and with enough quirks to endear it to the viewer.  Definitely a must see for fans of foreign.

1353501,5,B00004U1F9,"A masterfully humorous, compassionate, quiet and moving film by a Japanese director whose work has primarily been in documentaries. The premise is strange but thought-provoking: after death, you have to choose one memory  to take with you into eternity; everything else will be forgotten. In a  brilliant series of cuts the staff at a run-down, out-of-the-way  establishment explain this to the weekly intake of their ""clients""--people  who have just died. They have three days to decide; then the staff, with  summer-camp-like enthusiasm, stages tiny films that recreate the memories.  On the last day of the week the films are shown, and the clients vanish,  one by one, as they relive the memories that are projected.
Kore-Eda  worked with actors and scripts, actors telling the camera their own  memories, and non-professionals; the marvellous cast mixes all three and  it's impossible to tell which is which. A young girl wants to relive Splash  Mountain, only to reconsider after a worker gently tells her that thirty  others had made the same choice that year. A boastful roue explains that  the memory of course has to be of sex--and then chooses something quite  different. An old woman remembers dancing for her older brother's friends  in a red dress, and shyly coaches the little girl who will play her in the  memory film. And a seventy-year-old salaryman can find nothing worth  remembering, so videotapes of his life are requisitioned--touching off what  plot there is.
There are no flashbacks and little overt drama, but as the  clients look back at their lives the staff are drawn in, and the viewers,  too, can't help but wonder what memory would be worth living with for ever.  What glows from the placid surface of this extraordinary film is the wonder  and mystery of everyday things, the tenuous but rich beauty of merely  living. ""After Life""-- the Japanese title is ""Wonderful Life""--is only  ostensibly about death; no film of recent years has been more life  affirming.",960768000,95,1995,5.04601226993865

1353504,5,B00004U1F9,"Nearly a decade after Albert Brooks suggested that each of us must prove his mettle in an after-life court of law (DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, 1991), Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda imagines us starring, post-mortem, in a supernatural film of our life's happiest moment.

AFTER LIFE is a richly imagined, completely original, and deeply moving film for an age when most understand the story of their lives as cinema.

The first part of the film is about each character remembering, deciding, and then choosing a memory that will follow them into eternity.

This is an agonizing choice for some...very easy for others. Some choose simple moments, while others pick more dramatic, obvious moments. Yet in each character's choice, we see ourselves, our own lives...our own life-defining stories.

The second part of the film plays like a behind-the-scenes, making-of documentary about each character stepping in to the literal role of their life.

Koreeda smartly supports his documentary-styled narrative with a parallel story...that of a quasi-romantic relationship that develops between two after-life facilitators/social workers. And it is in this sub-plot, that he gives voice to the concerns of the still-living.

This is fascinating filmmaking from one of the world's brightest and most honest filmmakers.",1308009600,6,1305,5.5

1353507,4,B00004U1F9,"This slow-moving, meditative film from Japan invites being understood in so many different ways. This is partly because it lingers so long on each of its characters as they reflect on their lives after death that it's hard to resist mentally scanning the contents of one's own memory for a ""happiest moment"" to preserve for eternity, while at the expense of forgetting everything else.

Eventually, the film seems as much about forgetting as remembering, for some characters refuse for various reasons to choose at all - which leaves them on the staff of the way-house that the newly dead pass through. Here, listening to the memories of others, they may eventually come to understand the purpose of their own lives. For the film is as much concerned with them as it is about the men and women, of all ages, who are being ""processed"" here on their way to eternity.

The setting of the film, in an aging institutional structure, and the time - autumn - are evocative of a kind of limbo that is only partly realistic. Many of the characters as they ramble on about their lives try your patience, even while the minutiae of their memories can be absorbing. It doesn't help to reflect on the improbability of it all, but to surrender instead to the dream-like tranquility of this other-world, where no one openly grieves the loss of their lives and all human transactions take place in an atmosphere of civilized politeness.

This is not a film for everyone. The director (a respected documentary filmmaker) has said that his inspiration for the film was his own memories of a grandfather whose last years were a descent into what we know today as Alzheimer's. The story his film tells is about how we formulate and recall the stories of our own lives. Rather than offering escapism, it keeps turning the focus back on the viewer. Which is good if you like that sort of thing, not so good if you don't.",1272844800,2,1898,4.676646706586826

1353509,5,B00004U1F9,"This film is absolutely beautiful in its cinematography, and its storyline is intriguing (even for those of us who see no persuasive reason for believing in an afterlife) and entertaining from the first minute to the last.

1353511,5,B00004U1F9,"The idea behind the movie seems too simple - once you die you go to a way station between Earth and Heaven.  You will stay there for a week.  The first three days you get to pick one memory you wish to live in - forever.  That memory becomes your after life.  The people at the station film it and show it to you at the end of the week.
The film's greatness is in the delivery.  We follow not just the dead, who struggle with either a life rich in good memories or one bland and lacking in anything, but those who work in the way station.  The station itself seems worn, but clean, with meeting rooms, a theater and even apartments.  It reminds me slightly of the high schools you see in the Japanese movies.  Maybe that's the point?
Anyway, even the people who work there struggle with themselves as they help those newly departed find one moment, one memory they can live with.  Or die with for an eternity.  What single event is worth so much that you can't let it go?  That it outweighs the rest of one's life?
It is very profound, sad and joyful at the same time.  A perfect movie in all respects.  I plan to try to find more of the director's works.",1187481600,7,1155,4.171945701357466
1353512,5,B00004U1F9,"There are many films referred to as 'lifelike,' as a positive attribute.  This marvelous film - ironically about a post-mortem limbo world - is one of few that actually earns the term.

AFTER LIFE's contents are well-summarized by many other reviewers here, so I'd rather point out a few other notable aspects of the films, rather than rehash previous comments.

Kore'eda's roots were in documentary work, and a fascination with the kinds of stories that might unfold right before our eyes is one is strongly explored here, and in his other work.  The same holds true for memory - specifically it's instability, it's idealistic qualities, and it's romantic nature.  This focus was - according to Kore'eda - actually inspired by the Alzheimers-related decline of his grandfather (a major personal influence and role-model) - and this interest was also powerfully explored in his earlier MABOROSI (grief and growing beyond grief), and DISTANCE (a real masterpiece, charting the shifts between grief, blame, redemption and forgiveness between individuals who survivied a cult terror attack).

In AFTER LIFE, the same themes are allowed to slowly unfold, with a slow and recollective quality that - to me - has always been riveting.  The film is very quiet in its' nature, so it may not be for everyone, but the drift towards naturalistic revelations is handled brilliantly here, leading to surprising moments of tenderness, and of dry and unexpected humor.  This is a film in which nothing feels forced, but a gradually-coalescing story does emerge, and move along on its' own hypnotic power.

There is yet another theme present here as well - the transformative magic of film as a creative medium.  The varied memories of the recently departed are commemorated in/as short films, improvisationally staged, which - under Kore'eda's guidance - is something of a love letter to film's potential as something democratic, and something that could record the spontaneous history and magic within 'ordinary' lives.

Successful at many levels, all of which weave together with skill and subtlety, AFTER LIFE is one of my favorites of recent years.  I highly recommend.

1353513,5,B00004U1F9,"A uniquely poignant meditation on life and death, Koreeda's ""After Life"" began as a documentary project in which the director interviewed 500 people about their favorite memories. Intercutting these with characters of his own devising adds a touch of wry humor to his compassionate story of everyday people struggling to isolate a golden moment from their worldly existence. The choices are surprising as well as profound: watching staffers fabricate one man's experience flying a plane with cotton-ball clouds and giant wind fans is as much a testament to the art of cinema as it is a comment on personal whimsy and sensory pleasure. With a deceptively simple premise, Koreeda fashions a deeply affecting homage to the sweet here-and-now.",1184112000,2,739,5.271186440677966

1353517,5,B00004U1F9,"This film is not for everyone, however, I highly recommend it. This is a very interesting Japanese film, which was released in 1998. In the film, when people die they spend a week with counselors who are also deceased. The counselors help the dead to pick one memory from their lives. This one memory will be with them for eternity. I know this sounds a little silly, but I found the film to be fascinating. I know that I am a little biased towards Japanese films, however, there was something about the film that drew me in and kept my attention.

The film is both humorous and compassionate. Once the deceased decide which memory they are to take with them into eternity, then ALL other memories will be forgotten. Which memory would you take? The staff of counselors who are there to help the deceased have films which help the dead decide which memory to take. When the deceased are shown the films of the memory they are to keep, then they vanish. I liked the way the film was done.

Moreover, the different characters whose lives were portrayed gave a very life affirming portrayal of what each person deemed was their most important memory to take with them into eternity. It almost seemed like a documentary film: Very profound. But as I wrote in the begining: for certain audiences only. However, I recommend you rent the film to see if it appeals to your taste. I liked the film very much. When I viewed the film, I actually began to think of my life and all the memories that I remembered were wonderful. There were too many to choose only one. It would be difficult if not impossible for me to choose.",1166054400,4,1613,4.501706484641638
1353518,5,B00004U1F9,"I agree with earlier reviewers that the English title of this film, ""After Life,"" is a bit misleading, because this film is not really about what happens after death; it is about the moments in which we feel truly alive. (The original Japanese title, ""Wonderful Life,"" is more fitting, but was probably scrapped for marketing reasons.) The movie's premise, that immediately following death we must pick a single memory to experience for all eternity, is just a vehicle for a much more important question: what do we really value in life, and what is worth holding onto?

The tone is quiet, unassuming, and at times even quaintly pragmatic. The characters, caught mid-conversation, talk directly and candidly to the screen. They reminisce about their lives, their loved ones, their joys and their regrets. They chatter on about the mundane and reflect on what their purpose, if any, in life, might have been. There are a lot of laughs in this movie that come from these scenes; it's the kind of empathetic humor you find in relating to a friend who's just recounted a funny experience or made an idiosyncratic but insightful comment.

In preparing for this movie, the director Kore-eda interviewed countless people about their most cherished memories, and interspersed some of this footage among the scripted scenes with no mention of which ones are real and which are scripted. This tactic, along with the clean, simple, interview style of both scripted and real scenes gives the film the feel of an intimate documentary.

""After Life"" is too modest to impose any particular positions on the viewer, but few who watch it will not be drawn to look inward. It asks us, in its quiet and unassuming way, not just about what we value in life, but also about what is (or at least should be) universally important. Very few films can successfully pull off such lofty reflections on human life, and even fewer do it with the grace, subtlety, and humility of this one.

Watch this movie when you're fully awake and alert; it proceeds at a slow pace, but it deserves every second of your attention.",1155081600,14,2088,4.840336134453781

Most of it consists of delicate little snippets of conversation with a group of recented deceased people. They relate stories of moments in their lives, with such beauty and poignancy and realism that one could imagine this a documentary. The ""acting"" (although it hardly seems to be acting at all!) is uniformly excellent.

In tiny snatches, we come to know quite lot about them. Best of all, the movie makes you think about life -- have we lived the kind of life that creates a memory we'd want to spend eternity with?

Kore-eda Hirokazu (the director) manages that rare combination of humor, pathos and intellect that makes this film a winner.",1152576000,7,719,4.829268292682927
1353520,5,B00004U1F9,"A quiet, contemplative movie concerning 22 people who are sent to a type of purgatory after death. The dead have one week to decide what one memory they will take with them into the after life. When they decide upon a memory, the memory is made into a film and the dead move on into the next life.

It is touching to see what people choose from their lifetimes. It usually comes down to something simple, like riding the trolley on the last day of school. A few people have trouble deciding because of things like alzheimers or unrequited love. Others won't decide and stay in purgatory. It makes a person wonder ""What do you own?""

There is much to admire here; the acting is top-notch, the contrast between chatty characters and completely silent people in the opening interview scenes is well-crafted, and the plot premise itself is a fascinating one. For me, films are all about endings, and I felt in this area After Life didn't quite pay off. I didn't really buy into the romance, and wanted to know more backstory about the female character so I could care more whether she gets the guy or not.  I also thought they could have cut it a bit more - it feels 10-15 minutes too long to me.

1353522,5,B00004U1F9,"""After Life"" is a meditative film that ponders whether our lives can be summed up in a single moment.  Specifically, when people die, they are sent to a weigh-station of sorts, where an assigned caseworker helps them pick one memory.  That moment will stay with them forever while they forget everything else about their lives.  Each week, a new batch of the recently deceased arrives, and the staff helps them pick the moment and then recreates and films it.  ""After Life"" depicts one week in this `office' and the complications that arise as the new arrivals slowly learn about themselves.

From the basic description, ""After Life"" sounds like fantasy, but the movie doesn't necessarily fit into that category.  Indeed, I was expecting the movie to be ethereal in look and tone, but it actually has a much more realistic feel to it.  This choice really helps ground the film and makes it more immediate and affecting.  We connect with the characters and feel ebullient when their moments start coming together.  ""After Life"" is first rate cinema better seen than described.  Some viewers may find it a bit slow-moving, but a little patience will result in a superior movie watching experience.

1353523,5,B00004U1F9,"What a wonderful story. This simple movie poignantly wraps the meaning of life into one moment of our memory and underlines the saying, ""an unexamined life is one not worth living.""

The premise of the story is that after we die some of us are transported into a wayward station, where we prepare ourselves for our next leg of our journey, the trip to eternity. But before we could depart we are asked to pick one memory from our past lives to take with us into infinity. Everything else would be forgotten. That choice, so achingly simple, debilitates many people; some wind up stuck for a long period in this state because of their ambivalence, fear, or regret.

At this station between life and eternity, the ""guests"" are assisted by ""workers"" who help them comb through their pasts for clues on what is possibly meaningful, valuable, truly unforgettable.

Once a memory is chosen, the staff recreates the scene by using elementary props and sets, like the ones you find on a high school stage production-a charming flourish by the director. (So who are the workers? Are they angels, devils, or bureaucrats in spirit form? The touching ending explains their origins.)

What is great about Kore-Eda's movies is his use of silence as a character: the silence in the snow, the quiet from within. (See ""Eureka"".) You will find that although his movies are quietly beautiful and beguiling, they do not provide answers to life's questions; they merely propose an idea; then allow us to ponder its worthiness. I trust this movie will leave you pondering for a quite a long time.",1128988800,4,1574,4.797047970479705
1353524,5,B00004U1F9,"Opinions, if you'll pardon the expresseion, are like butt-holes: Everyone has one.  And movies like this one are sure to bring out quite a varriation of them, especially since it is an American release of a Japanese film. Most Americans I talk to about this movie are bored by its slow pace, complete absence of background music, and lack of super-expressive acting. However, all my Japanese friends find great emotional value in this masterpiece by Hirokazu Koreeda. This, I believe, is mostly because of cultural differences. Culture is the context of one's exhistance, the filter through which one interprets reality... so with that in mind, what makes sence and is thoughroughly enjoyable to one group, could be completely incomprehensible to another.

My own personal opinion is that this is a wonderfully understated human drama about life, memories, and deeper meaning to one's existance. Filmed documentary-style, its almost as if you're watching a home-video of real people talking about real meaningful experiences from their lives... not actors on a screen.

Japanese films must be approached on their cultural terms. If, you are unwilling to do that, then you won't get as much out of watching one, and I suggest you stick to hollywood movies. If its nonstop action you're wanting... watch a different movie!  But, if you are willing to step out of yourself, away from your own culture for a couple hours, I think you'll find this film and others like it to be a very thought-provoking, inspiring, and uplifting experience.",1125532800,2,1535,5.103585657370518
1353525,3,B00004U1F9,"Kirokazu Kore-eda spent almost a decade working for a Japanese independent TV station-where he directed several dazzling documentaries that dealt with the fringe elements in Japanese society. He enjoyed tremendous success with his first feature film, MABOROSI (1995). He directed AFTER LIFE in 1998, and it was very well received by the critics.

Kore-eda has created a unique place-a way station where all souls must stop for one week-housed in a run-down abandoned complex. The souls are counseled and told that they are, in fact, dead-and that they are in transition. They are tasked to review their lives and come up with-to choose one favorite memory-but only one. It might have been an epiphany, a trauma, a pivotal moment-or merely a pleasant thing that floats to the surface. The ""staff"" would then recreate that memory on film-and the souls would gather in a theatre and view it on the seventh day. Once reviewed and connected with-then the soul would be allowed to more on-to somewhere-to something. As the souls move on they would be able to cherish that one memory-and all the other earthly memories of their past lives were supposed to be expunged.

 In Kore-eda's vision of the other side there is no God, or the Devil, no angels or demons-not even the mention of any particular religion. In this middle world, this stopping place-apparently there are ""many"" way stations. I would hope so. They only process a couple dozen souls a week through them-and that would most certainly not keep up with the death rate. The largest bone of contention I had with this lovely film was its central premise-the pick only one memory motif. I would like to consider that once on the other side, every memory of our past life would matter-as we view our ""Life Review"". Somehow this put my mind and my emotions in turmoil. So, I apologize, Kore-Eda San. I could not approach your vision and the sweetness of your film with an open mind or an open heart. One critic in LIBERTAS wrote,"" Kore-Eda's strength is clearly lyrical rather than philosophical.""

Kore-dea appeared, with his crew, in this film-as the film crew within the staff of the way station. It helped make the transition from documentary to fiction more palatable. The director had interviewed 500 people, and then chose 13 to appear in the film. They appeared as themselves and improvised their own dialogue. He used one cinematographer for the interviews, and another to establish the mood and tone of the way station and its phantom staff. The blending of real and imagined dialogue is not always smooth-but the concept is very creative and interesting.

I had heard the buzz about this film for a long time, and I was really looking forward to viewing it. Perhaps I expected too much-wanted too much-had expected it to answer some of my specific after life and spiritual questions. But instead, for me it just posed conundrums, and bent perceptions-and offered what seemed to be a silly and unworkable postulation. I do applaud the sweet sadness and insight the film exhibits-and would recommend it.",1124409600,,3064,4.895953757225434
1353526,1,B00004U1F9,"Afterlife would have been more interesting as a 1 hour drama, than what it is. It is boring and tedious to watch and the characters are uninteresting.

The movie is filmed almost as a documentary, and the people portrayed are given rich histories, especially since they have to describe them to employees of the After Life who work in an abandoned office building. These recently decreased are given 3 days to remember their best memory which they will take as they either go to Heaven or Hell. The employees will recreate the memory for them.

We are introduced to up to 22 characters, and 4 or so employees. They are all serene and have different issues and they talk a lot. I'm surprise that the employees didn't fall over asleep listening to the memories of these boring people. It definitely doesn't help that all these people talk in monotone.

The problem with this movie is that beyond it's interesting premise, we have nothing of interest here. The movie is broken up by days and basically we have people talking. The problem is that if this were a real documentary, this could have been interesting, but I was always aware that they are actors and they are basically reading off their lines. Their stories have no substance because we only get to hear them, not experience them.

This is an incomplete review because I could not watch the rest of the DVD (I fast forwarded it). The performances were too contrived, the director obviously didn't have the budget to show the lives of these people and the whole picture is like being forced to read a classic piece of literature which everyone says is really great, but no one actually reads. The worst part of the movie was the ending, where these poor souls were forced to relive more memories from more boring dead people.",1120694400,2,1782,4.665605095541402

1353529,5,B00004U1F9,"The idea - moving through the transition from this life to the next - is not a new one, and there is plenty of room for imaginative storytelling. But compare the simplicity and understated elegance of writer/director Hirokazu Kore-Eda's AFTER LIFE to the gaudy, superficial, and star-studded Hollywood production DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, and you will see the difference between cinematic art and cinematic entertainment. I have watched AFTER LIFE three times and enjoyed it more each time I've seen it. Not only does it leave you thinking about your own life, it fills you with an almost Zen-like appreciation for life's unique small pleasures, the ones most easily overlooked or forgotten in the crush of everyday life.

The basic story line is simple. After dying, the deceased migrate in small groups to special facilities where they have three days to choose a memory from their life that is particularly meaningful to them. They will be permitted to carry that one memory into the next life. The staff at each facility assists them in choosing and prepares a short film that replicates each person's special event to strengthen the memory just before they pass to the other side. AFTER LIFE presents one week's group at one facility, ranging from a teenage girl who wants to choose Disneyland to an old man who can't seem to choose anything. Mixed into this group are several elderly women, a rebellious young man who refuses to choose, and an older man who insists from the beginning that his choice will involve having sex.

Kore-Eda uses a pseudo-documentary style, complete with unsteady camera movements and obvious jump cuts in the personal interviews. The background is anything but celestial, looking more like an abandoned prep school dormitory or army barracks, complete with bare walls, peeling paint, and the most Spartan of furniture. Seasons change, flowers bloom, snow falls, the moon rises, and cars even pass by this not-very-ethereal place, as if the location of this limbo was just an out-of-the-way corner of a big city that no one happened to notice any more. The choice is masterful, allowing us to focus entirely on the deceased group and the consultants who assist them (all of whom have never been able to choose their memory and have thus stayed behind).

Of all possible weeks, Kore-Eda presents this group for its special relationship to Michizuki, one of the staff consultants. Although he appears to be just 22 or 23, Michizuki died 53 years earlier, shot in the Philippines during World War II. Although he is the object of another consultant's affections, the young Shiori (a Japanese Meg Tilly look-alike), Michizuki discovers that he has a romantic connection through one of the people in that week's group to a woman who died several years earlier. When he learns the nature of the deceased woman's feelings for him from the memory she chose to take to her afterlife, Michizuki finally finds the reason and the courage to select his cherished memory and move on to his next life.

AFTER LIFE is a wonderfully uplifting story, filled with likable characters who are remarkable for seeming so average. Despite the subtitling, this is a movie you can hardly help but fall in love with. Kore-Eda's message, and the self-reflection he evokes, is as powerful as any Sunday sermon you're likely to hear. Of course, you'll inevitably find yourself trying to answer the movie's central question - what single memory of your life would you take with you to whatever comes next?",1111017600,5,3503,4.9625212947189095

The actors act with an immediacy that is direct, refreshing and sweet - there is little self-consciousness usually involved in ""acting"" ... possibly also because  the Japanese are much less obsessed with the ""self"" than us Westerners.

In any case, the director did a superb job in coaxing the actors to be real, and he did it with VERY little money.  If yu want to see a movie that will touch your heart and make you stop, and actually become aware of your life and its path, see After Life.",1107129600,3,731,4.201438848920863
1353531,5,B00004U1F9,"One of the most commonly reported aspects of near-death experiences is the life review, the seeing and re-experiencing of major and trivial events of one's life, sometimes from the perspective of the other people involved. Most say that the single most important lesson they learned is that the actions we think are trivial and unimportant turn out to be the most important, especially ones that involve spontaneous acts of love.

In After Life, by Hirokazu Koreeda, a group of recently deceased people are asked to look back at their life and choose only one memory that they want to take with them to eternity. The process compels people to look at their life in its entirety and see what worked and what was missing. In what looks like a dreary barracks-like way station, civil servants meet with those just crossed over to help them choose the experience they want to hold on to. For some, the choice is easy, for others it is quite difficult. Those that will not or cannot choose are consigned to work in the substation with the newly deceased until they are ready to move on. The counselors work one-on-one with each individual, telling them that they have three days to make their choice. Once a memory is selected, a film crew recreates the memory -- sets are built and the little touches of sights and sounds are selected until the deceased are satisfied that they are witnessing a perfect recreation of their experience. It is that film that they take with them, not the original memory.

At first some choose things such as a trip to Disneyland, a sexual encounter, or a memorable bowl of rice, but later gravitate toward experiences that are more meaningful. The center of the film revolves around those who are unable to choose. Ichiro Watanabe (Taketoshi Naito) is a 70-year old management consultant who has led an uneventful life and is challenged to find a memory he thinks is worth preserving for all time. To help him in this process, he is allowed to scan through piles of videotapes representing each year of his life. One young man wants to choose a dream instead of an actual event. Another wants to forget his past entirely, and an elderly woman is stuck in the mindset of a nine-year old girl.

After Life is the story of the caseworkers as well. Takashi Mochizuki (Arata) has been stuck in limbo because he cannot find any happiness in his twenty-two years until he realizes how his short life deeply affected someone else. His perfect realization also affects a co-worker Shiori (Susumu Terajima) who has fallen in love with him. After Life is a beautiful and touching film that allows us to reflect on the things that brought us joy in our own life, and to recognize that true happiness lies, not in outward symbols of success, but in giving ourselves to others.",1101340800,3,2790,4.713114754098361
1353532,5,B00004U1F9,"The Japanese title of this film is ""Wonderful Life,"" and wonderful it is.
Kore-Eda uses the premise of choosing one memory for all eternity as a compelling way to explore themes of memory, closure, loss and existential meaning. The film starts out with interesting stories of unique memories recounted by actors and non-actors.  A small plot develops as the story follows the case of an older, slightly arrogant retired salaryman who believes he lived a meaningful life but is having a hard time choosing his one memory.  Keep in mind that people who hated this film probably prefer plot-driven dramas.  ""After Life"" is driven by quiet observations, with a small plot driving the film's main statement.
The thing that impressed me the most was Kore-eda's representation of heaven or the after life.  Kore-eda's heaven evokes and celebrates so many aspects of Japanese daily life -- the school life of children, the driving productivity of salarymen, and the quiet, contented simplicity of the elderly population. The staff of counselors at this halfway-house to eternity scrub the floors and tidy up their office first thing in the morning the way my Japanese mother remembers doing at her school in 1950s Tokyo.  Like salarymen, they discuss their increasingly heavy case load and the film follows the tense timeline of their one-week deadline to recreate and film the memories. The film also captures the beauty of falling autumn leaves and sakura (cherry blossoms) through the eyes of an elderly woman with Alzheimers.
There is no idealism in Kore-eda's heaven.  The staff's  building looks like an old, run-down school house and the props they use to film their staged memories have a summer camp, high school production feel to it.  Some of the dead change their minds about their memories, and one chooses not to pick at all. The staff is also faced with a corporate schedule and mom-and-pop resources, but things eventually fall into palce.
Oddly enough, in Kore-Eda's heaven, there is no closure.  The counselors who run the place have chosen for various reasons to not pick one memory for all eternity, and they must continue on with the daily frustrations of being human.  People still experience unrequited love and loneliness in heaven.  Counselors pass time by reading the encyclopedia volume by volume.  There seems to be little solace, except in the closure one makes for oneself by finally choosing a memory.
Kore-eda's film doesn't make any striking or profound statements about existential meaning, God or eternity.  In fact, there are no evocations of God or a higher power.  By singling out one memory (true or fabricated), the film almost suggests that the experience of living is really just ""content"" for us to draw from in deciding what the meaning of our existence has been in the end.  The film benignly suggests that meaning doesn't seem to exist in its own right, it's something illusory that people create.  We aren't faulted for needing illusions, it just seems to be an accepted part of our humanity.
For such a quiet film to make such compelling and powerful observations, I give it 5 stars.",1087776000,2,3123,4.988439306358382
1353533,5,B00004U1F9,"After Life is a thought provoking film that depicts 22 individuals who have been sent to a place between the living and the hereafter.  This place functions as a reflective and meditative station where three counselors are to guide the 22 characters through questions to remember their most enjoyable moment while alive.  However, there is one stipulation to this task for each individual, which limits their contemplation of their memories to three days.  The following step for the three counselors is to recreate the memory of each individual through shooting a film that resembles their fond memory.  After Life is shot with a grainy texture and the cinematography reminds the audience of the spontaneous camera movement of documentary styled films.  This is a part of Koreeda's deliberate direction as he wants to depict his brilliant vision and persuade the audience to ponder their own existence while breathing.",1084924800,2,919,5.224489795918367
1353534,2,B00004U1F9,"When I rented this movie, the premise sounded very compelling. The more the movie played out, however, the more difficult it became to accept. Most of the movie was so slow moving that it gave me time to wonder:
Why they would go to the trouble of recreating a ""treasured moment"" when they seemed to have the real thing already on video?
What would a persons eternity be like reliving a single moment over and over?
Many memories become golden by years of reflection. Even more damaging, if a person's memory was wiped clean of everything except their chosen moment, the moment itself wouldn't be worth reliving once let alone an infinite number of times with no memory of what led up to that point. (The movie comes close, perhaps, to defining a type of hell.)
Technically, the acting was mostly only marginally good and the direction seemed very uninspiring. The English subtitles, fortunately, were of very good contrast and easy to read.
The IDEA of the movie gave my wife and I something to discuss. It is for that reason I gave it two stars instead of one. But we could have had just as good a discussion by merely having read the description on the DVD box without having to waste over 90 minutes viewing this very slow movie that, I feel, could have been MUCH better.",1082505600,2,1275,4.572052401746725

This is a terrific, thought-provoking concept that is very well executed.  Director Hirokazu Kore-eda downplays the metaphysical angle by placing his characters in a very pragmatic, down-to-earth environment--an old building, harried case workers on a tight schedule, and a noticeable and commendable lack of ethereal visual or sound effects.  We are treated to many interesting interviews with clients who are trying to select a memory.  Some of these interviews are genuine and unscripted, conducted with non-actors.  The most touching moments come as we get to know the case workers better and learn about their inner lives and the reason that they have been selected to work in this place rather than moving on to the next.",1038268800,5,902,5.108843537414966
1353536,1,B00004U1F9,"...P>There were 3 main things that were so bad about this film. 1: The way it was filmed, 2: The premise behind it, 3: The execution of this premise.
The movie was filmed so that the picture is very grainy. While this does in a way go with the idea that everyone there is dead, it came off more as just a ...shallow camera trick. Secondly, the subtitles of the film are yellow. There are a lot of light colors in the film so half the time they were barely readable. If you can't understand Japanese then be careful.
The premise is a bad one indeed. Dead people go to this place where they pick 1 memory from their life to bring with them to heaven (or the Japanese equivalent thereof). Then the staff of this place recreate their memory and film it. HUH? They film it? If they have the power to bring people here after they die then why are they using old cameras and techniques to capture their memories on film, which they can't take to ""heaven?"" And what about the people that died before film was invented? Plus, if you don't think of a memory, you stay there forever and join the staff. I wonder why more people just didn't do that.
Finally, the execution of the movie stutters and stumbles along. Half of the film is just people talking about their memories (""I remember when I was in the field making rice balls."" etc) and the other half is about the drama that takes place between the staff members. The movie can't figure out whether it's going to focus on the dead people or the staff and so the general focus of the action is terrible. Then there's a dramatic scene where one of the staff members meets someone he once knew and then finally decides on a memory so he can go to heaven. Wow, could that be any more cliched?
Perhaps there is some value in the movie's supposed message (which according to the other reviews here is to value the small things in life). But the way that the movie was filmed, planned and executed drowns out this message...",1038096000,5,1961,4.346049046321526

It is extremely rare for me to grace a film release with the coveted ''Five Star'' for a review score, but let me state for the record that dispite this scoring system's limitation to only ''five'' stars, I give Koreeda Hirokazu's ''After Life'' (Japanese title: ''Wonderful Life'') ''Nine Stars!'' It is a film that should be seen and taken to heart, despite whatever theological or eschatological beliefs the viewer may have. (This was not designed as or intended to be a religious film ... if it causes the viewer to reflect more deeply upon their particular religious ideology or to meditate on spiritual matters that's not necessarily a bad thing, but film clearly addresses something else entirely.)

Inspired by experiences he witnessed in his own family life , Koreeda-san presents the viewer with an intriguing premise: After death, you are taken to a processing center (or ''Limbo,'' if you will) ... While there you are given a deadline of only three days to choose just one memory that you can take with you into eternity -- These memories are then reproduced on film and shown on screen inside a special movie theatre that also serves as the launching pad to take you to your ''final destination'' as you ''relive'' (view) your most cherished memory.

The ''Limbo'' situation, as portrayed in this film, is unnervingly esoteric and confusing, and yet it offers an amazingly refreshing break from the stereotypically pristine, anticeptic, sterile, ''impersonal'' visual representations of post-life scenarios we've all been force-fed throughout history (much like the skinny effeminate visual representations of Jesus) and presents us with a setting that actually exudes a feeling of warmth, comfort, compassion, and familiarity, despite the obviously near-ramshackled and uninspiring state of this particular transfer point.

Some viewers may be a little put-off by the slowness of the film's pace, but this is extremely necessary for the important character development that takes place. Granted, the film could have done better by providing us with fewer ''initiates'' going through this particular processing phase, so as to allow for even deeper character development; at the same time, however, processing such a large group of people at one time, as presented in the movie, as well as the number of ''interviewers,'' provides us with a smorgasbord of personalities and motivations which  highlights the vast differences and uniquenesses of the characters on screen and gives us added motivation to reflect on our own differences and uniquenesses, as well as how we act and interact with one other. (The final scene with Arata-san's character, ''Mochizuki,'' is especially touching.)

No, the film does not answer all of the questions it poses, nor does it really try to, nor do I think it should -- it is, for all intents and purposes, an examination into the human soul, if you will, and merely intends to have its viewers reflect on the more important questions raised and to motivate us into taking a long, deep, hard look at our very short lives and reflect on our most dear and cherished moments, and to not only ask ourselves ''which one'' memory would we choose to take with us and why, but to also ask ourselves if it could even be possible for us to select just one.

(For a deeper understanding of what Koreeda-san was trying to accomplish with this film, be sure to read the segment entitled ''Director's Statement'' on the DVD edition of the film.)

If you get sucked into it, as I did, you'll find yourself making back stories for lots of the characters.

It reminded me of Dead Poets' Society's theme of ""Carpe Diem"", in that it left me thinking about what I had done in my life so far, and it left me resolving to experience life to the fullest. And the thought lingered even after the movie ended. The story has a sober tone, and the characters are so believable that I found myself empathising with them.
The story is a roller-coaster ride, though not in the mould of suspense, adventure, or horror thrillers. The basic premise of the movie is that you can bring one (and only one) memory with you to the afterlife after you die. I found myself getting immersed in the lives of the characters, as they sieved through their life experiences, looking for that gem in their life. I experienced their joy and sadness of recollection, their anguish at leaving some precious memories behind, their sense of satisfaction as a memory was re-constructed for them, etc. There was just such a myriad of feelings to experience as I sat through the movie, that moments of boredom were non-existent. I was constantly looking forward to what the next scene would bring.
You will likely see in the characters someone you know, be it your neighbours, your relatives, or even yourself. All this contributed to the sense of empathy I felt. I found myself thinking, ""What if this is what happens when I die?"". It was sobering.
Although the idea behind this movie is clever, and this movie is likely to get your brain juices flowing, I think the slow pace and limited action scenes would likely reduce the number of people who would actually sit through this. If you're not the type who occasionally sits back and thinks about what life actually is all about, this movie may not grab you like it grabbed me.

1353547,3,B00004U1F9,"A deeply profound film filled with achingly-beautiful moments that ostensibly deals with memory.  No doubt the film is partly about the resilient but illusory nature of our memories, but it's also about our own reconciliation between material success and the true meanings of life.  I was particularly struck by one man's realization that the reason why he cannot come up with a happy memory is because he was oblivious of the moment when he made his mark on the world we so briefly occupy.  What he was oblivious to was somebody else's love for him, a love that, although not reciprocated, is a sign nevertheless, an indication that he was alive, that he lived a worthy life.  The film is deliberately paced, but that's not a problem because it gives the audience time to contemplate about what our happiest memories would be, what lasting marks or legacies we have left behind.  The real problem with the film, however, is that its profundities are enveloped in the clunkiest of plots, bulked up with a number of unnecessary elements (the filming of individual memories, the unrequited love of one of the staff members).  I know that to some, my complaints about the plot may seem petty compared to the sublime meaning of this film, but I found its poignancy too obscured by questions I had about the plot.  For example, why videotape?  Doesn't Limbo (or whatever this intermediate stage is) have digital technology?  What about people who died before, say, the 1970's?  Would they know what a videotape is or even know how to operate a VCR?  And I'm also certain that computer effects can do a much better job of recreating clouds than a mass of cotton balls on a wire.  Kore-eda would have been better off if the dreams had been reconstructed in a nondescript black box because its depiction of Limbo as some shabby terrestrial movie studio is just too hard to swallow.  It's difficult to transcend our misplaced worship of the material world when we are so conscious of the hard fact that we are watching a movie, a movie we paid 8 bucks to see.  At any rate, a week after seeing the film, I'm still thinking about what my one lasting memory would be.  Like the characters in the film, I initially came up with memories of important achievements filled with self-satisfaction and material rewards, but upon further contemplation, I too realize that they do not represent what my life is about.

For that reason it twangs the ol' heartstrings louder and more musically than the most expensive Hollywood super-packaged drama.
The fundamental human tragedy is that we grow old and have to leave this world, and all the memories we've accumulated, like refugees driven from our homes.  Against this tragedy, of which young people are mercifully unconscious and the middle-aged all-too-conscious, all other tragedy is played out like busy action in front of a grand unmoving backdrop.
Rather than promising us a saccharine-sweet Heaven (as in 'What Dreams May Come') to paint a Disney happy-ending over the fundamental sorrow of life, this film offers us a moral and intellectual challenge -- to discover the one precious thing we would save from ""this burning house"" and take with us into an Eternity so different, so strange, that in it we will have become nothing but this one vivid memory.
Few films I've ever seen have captured the poignancy of time and its passage, the emotional wealth and fragility of old age, the tragedy of life wasted, the depth of human self-deception, and the capriciousness with which meaning, like lightning, strikes in any life and illuminates some completely unexpected moment.  Plenty of writers and directors have tried.  But this film -- unpretentious, gentle, quiet, and full of a kindly, self-deprecating humour -- captures all of that and more.
The only jarring note -- and it may have been introduced deliberately to preserve a realistic ""japanese bureaucracy"" feeling in the processing centre -- is that there's only one female staff member (and she's always the one serving tea, too)...  While this may irritate the feminist viewer a little, it's a minor irritation in a nearly perfect film.
This is a fine film, a delight.  I confidently predict it will stand the test of time and in 20 years be considered a classic. See it and think about your life :-)",971568000,10,2190,5.011019283746556
1353550,5,B00004U1F9,"I am the DVD Producer who authored ""Afterlife."" I can understand the reviewers complaint about the subtitles being in the video, not as a menu driven feature. This was the only version of the master that was available for the DVD. I certainly would have loved to have a new digital master from a pristine print without the subtitles and a DVD subtitle feature, but it just wasn't possible for this release, given the timetable and budget constraints. One of the problems with DVD releases of ""Indy/Art"" films ( and I don't mean that in any kind of negative way) is that availability of masters specifically for a DVD are hard to come by. We had to use the master that was created for the VHS release in the USA, which was created with the subtitles. I hope that this doesn't detract too much from the film, because it's a great film and I think that anyone that buys the DVD and watches the film will feel that they got their money's worth. At least I hope so, even though in an ideal world I would have loved to do this film justice with a new, pristine master created specifically for the DVD release.",970444800,19,1103,4.411764705882353

7923364,4,B00004U1F9,"Kore-eda Hirokazu is among the very best Japanese directors working right now and After Life (1998) is his second feature film. He has been likened to Ozu Yasujir and Hou Hsiao Hsien in terms of style, but it strikes me that his films are marked more by documentary film techniques which put him at a distance from these two. Still Walking (2008) is undeniably an Ozuian shomingeki (family home drama), but with 5 of his 14 films being documentaries and hand-held camerawork, amateur actors and improvisation figuring largely in the rest of his work, Kore-eda has carved out a niche for himself touching on very real contemporary problems in Japanese society in a unique and special way. While Nobody Knows (2004), I Wish (2011) and the recent Like Father Like Son (2013) showcase his ability to extract fine performances from children, After Life focuses very sharply and movingly on the way we look back and make sense out of our lives, and how these memories are translated onto film.

The story is fairly simple, opening on the rushing feet of two people going up a flight of stairs to enter an office. They join a meeting where a group of workers (we later learn they are social counselors) are informed by their boss that a new intake of people are about to arrive for an as yet unexplained purpose. We cut to the foyer of the same run-down public building (an old school?) with a number of people entering out of a blinding light. They register and are told to wait in a room. When everyone is assembled they are informed that counselors will interview them one by one. It turns out that all these people have died the previous day and that they are now in a half-way house en-route to the great beyond. The counselors are there to help them choose over a period of a week one memory from the whole of their lives which they can take with them forever, everything else to be erased. These memories are taken down by the counselors and then filmed to the best of their ability. These films are shown to the group members and as they see their own memory recreated on the big screen they disappear one by one.

I think its worth saying at the start that this is not a religious film. A possibly preachy story about heaven and hell would no doubt put off a number of people and this film is remarkable for the complete absence of any such dogma. Instead, as each person looks back on their past we have an extraordinary kaleidoscope of memories which sum up collectively the rich tapestry of human life. Kore-eda has said that he used improvisation freely in the first part of the film which consists of talking heads being interviewed across a table and that many of the memories related are real. One old man Shoda Gisuke (Yuri Tru) can think back only to carnal pleasures while another remembers a childhood trip on a tram. One man recollects the joy of piloting an airplane while another recounts the simplicity of lying naked on a futon as a baby and being bathed in the glorious late afternoon light. A retired soldier recalls eating rice cooked by US soldiers in the Phillipines during the war while a senile old lady (Nishimura Kiyo) luxuriates in her memories of cherry blossoms. A woman wants to recreate a childhood memory of swinging between bamboo trees, another of dancing in a red dress and yet another of an affair with a married man. The memories range from the comic (a teenage girl recalling the tacky joys of Tokyo Disneylands Splash Mountain) to the tragic (the loss of a love). The most problematic cases are those who refuse point-blank to decide (Iseya Yusuke), and those whose lives were so dull and boring that they have nothing they want to remember. Such a case is Watanabe Ichiro (Nait Taketoshi) and its the way his personal life tangles with that of his counselor Mochizuki Takashi (Iura Arata) and (by extension) assistant counselor Satonaka Shiori (Oda Erika) that provides the dramatic heart of the latter half of the film. It is in the memory Watanabe finally chooses that we encounter Kagawa Kyko (veteran of classic films by Ozu, Kurosawa and Mizoguchi from the 1950s) playing his wife. It would be telling too much to describe the story completely, but you can believe that what transpires is intensely moving. What could have been sentimental mush in other hands is translated through Kore-edas fly on the wall documentary style as tender and extremely moving.

Kore-eda never gives away the cause of each persons death, but we can make fair guesses from the way they choose or don't choose their memories. Shiori is possibly the unhappiest of the counselors and through her the director explores contemporary society where many young people lead empty materialistic lives, cant communicate with their parents and feel rejected at every turn. Her crush on Mochizuki is rendered subtly in the restrained manner of Japanese culture and her final conundrum will resonate deeply within anyone who has ever suffered rejection on a regular basis in their personal lives. Im itching to give a more analytical review of this film, but to do so would give away too much. I simply urge anyone with an interest in Japanese cinema and in the basic metaphysics of why we live to watch this film closely.

The English title After Life is slightly misleading given that the Japanese title is Wandafuru Raifu and refers specifically to Frank Capras Its a Wonderful Life (1949). That is also the story of a man who makes sense of his life by being separated from it so that he can look back dispassionately and assess the reality of what it has added up to. Kore-eda manages to convey the same level of spiritual uplift as that film, but without the sentimentality or the religious subtext. I defy anyone who is engaged by this simple and compassionate little gem to not come away thinking about their own lives deeply. What memory would you choose? Have you achieved anything in your life which youd like to remember forever? What have you contributed? What has been the meaning of your life? In a way After Life is todays modern-day answer to Kurosawa Akiras masterpiece, Ikiru (1953).

This region 2 Soda Pictures DVD is very good quality. I have no gripes over the clear 4x3 (1:1.77) aspect ratio and clear soundtrack. Aside from a tiny stills gallery there are no extras which is a shame. Kore-eda is hardly a household name in the West though the TV series Going My Home (2012) has made him famous here in Japan. Like Father Like Son did get a prize at Cannes this year and hopefully will get more attention for him. I notice After Life is being offered in a cheap box set together with Nobody Knows, Still Walking and Air Doll. That would appear to be the best way of buying this as the other three films are also well worth having. For those who are unsure this cheap single disc Soda release is perfectly recommendable.",1411430400,3,6854,4.670529801324503

Hirokazu interviewed 500 individuals adolescent through senility and arranged to recreate their memory on film. These documentary pieces are interwoven with actors who create a mythical purgatory in which each decedent is given 3 days to choose among life's recollections a single scene to film, after which they disappear with their memory into the next realm. Actors portray guardian angels who help people recall the meaningful moments of their lives by deception, asking questions, manipulation, providing photos, maps, videos one for each year of life ""these videos may not match what you recall."" Recall imperfectly reflects confusion, myth, affection, and the disconnect between how we want to be seen and what really happened. Actors are interwoven with the documentary interviews.

Mochizuki is a 22yo angel assigned to interview two older bland men, Yamamoto 50 who wants to obliterate his past and Watanabe 71 yo who can't recall a life memory worth preserving. The most difficult cases are the ordinary. Shiori 18yo an intern for the past year is assigned to assist Mochizuki. Her brash emotional outbursts are blamed on  ""that's what happens when you are raised without a dad."" Shiori's adolescent impatience with the bamboo quiet bursts forth with indiscreet revelations protected by colleague Kawashima ""who is Kyoko?. Their boss Kennosuke Nakamura reprimands Shiori ""the moon is beautiful, the shape never changes, it only looks different depending on the light"" hoping she understands. Boss Nakamura's competitive ego (prideful need to win) incarcerates him in purgatory.

Tatara Kimiko born 1920 plays herself. The documentary filming of her defining memory of red is beyond the price of rubies.

Kiyo Nishimura's dementia weaves a fascination with natural beauty as an eternal 9yo. Gisuke Shoda recounts his sexual exploits. Yusuke Iseya 21 years refuses to choose a memory. He believes not selecting a single memory consigns him to being responsible for each moment of his entire life. Kana Yoshino 16yo chooses eating pancakes in Disneyland while Shiori gently prods and pushes her to search for more meaningful memories. Nobuko Amano a professional woman discusses her affair with a married man. Is this memory or a self deceiving memory of being loved?

How far back can you remember? Bundo recalls being 5 months old lying nude in the sunlight. Hot tub immersion is offered for quelling anxiety, recreating the womb.

The dilemmas of the 22 individuals in this week's purgatory cohort slowly play out over 3 days allotted to retrieve and select the single memory which becomes the only accompaniment into the great beyond. After Life is a coming of age documentary-movie amalgam, intertwined with music which is believed to improve memory retention. Some with dementia are still able to sing, play musical instruments, retrieve music-associated memory&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-Who-Mistook-His-Wife-For-A-Hat-And-Other-Clinical-Tales/dp/0684853949/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Music-Never-Stopped/dp/B004QL7JTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Music Never Stopped</a>&nbsp;Grateful Dead true story,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Awakenings/dp/B0043X1FL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Awakenings</a>.

The entire lifespan from labor, crib, dating, marriage, midlife dreams, to maturation, aging senility is portrayed with powdered snow gentleness. And the surprise is who is assigned the role of interviewing guiding angel, and what happens to the guardians.

SPOILER ALERT On re-view the first and last scenes are identical. Kawashima is assigned to interview men who regale him with their sexual exploits. Why? Iseya is assigned as Kawashima's intern. Why? The moon seen through the skylight is a movie set. On the roof, the prop master shines the shadows which play on the painted moon.

Mochizuki ""I searched for a memory of happiness and learn 50 years later I was part of someone else's happiness. What a wonderful discovery.""

My interpretation is the entire film is a movie set to move the stuck guardians in general, and Mochizuki in particular, toward eternity. Mochizuki was assigned Shiori as intern as a sign that he is to guide another forward before he leaves. Shiori clings to sentimentality, a crush on Mochizuki as an excuse to not choose a memory and forget him. Iseya is assigned as intern to Kawashima as a sign that Kawashima will be next targeted to move on. Kawashima shares with Shiori advice for handling men who pridefully regale with their sexual conquests during their 3 day interviews, preparing her for an assault on her fixation with insincere romantic theatricality and drama. The persons interviewed are quickly shuffled through as part of the work of the guardian angels. But the process is actually directed at moving the guardians on. Mochizuki has been in multiple facilities over his 50 years as a guardian angel. The time has come for him to discover himself.

After Life has the texture of a coming of age saga, paced for immersion and contemplation. 18yo Shiori's short attention span is engaged by traffic, crowds, a mechanical clock, similar to the Rube Goldberg device in the Boston Logan airport, unwilling to engage the patience required to absorb understanding. The hopeful message is if you don't grow up on earth, you are forced to grow up After Life where pride matures into humility, dependence into responsibility, impatience into languor, reactivity into self management.

5 stars hopeful movie of growing up allowing awareness to unfold with stately grace.

7923370,5,B00004U1F9,"I've watched the movie twice from Netflix and finally bought my own DVD.  It's a very culturally Japanese movie and makes more sense if you're already familiar with Japanese films, especially from an earlier period.  Much of the reminiscing the subjects do relates to events that happened when they were young, sometimes before World War II.  Americans would approach this whole subject somewhat differently.

It appears to be a low budget film with lots of extras but the acting is very good.  Several of the characters are played by veteran Japanese performers.  They give the impression of representing a cross-section of the Japanese public.  Much of the movie is filmed in an old school building and this lends to the atmosphere.  The subtitling is well done - always important in a Japanese film.

The topic is intriguing and it was presented very well with a surprising amount of insightful commentary.  The choices each person makes are very revealing in that the incidents they choose to remember often seem trivial, often just a bright moment during a particular day that made a big impression on them.  Some, on the other hand, are much deeper and more involved.

Essentially, the movie is a collection of vignettes into the lives of the 22 subjects as well as the counselors, very sensitively chosen and assembled.  It's a thinking person's movie.  If you like to be thrilled with action and breathtaking visuals it's not for you.  If you're reflective and like to ponder deeper questions you'll probably love it.",1361750400,3,1525,4.948818897637795
