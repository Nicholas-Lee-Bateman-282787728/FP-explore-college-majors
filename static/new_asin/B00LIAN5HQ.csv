8666087,3,B00LIAN5HQ,"This movie is fair in my opinion.  I did think it would be a little better funny wise.  There's a couple funny lines, but not many and it really could use some.  The other reason why I only gave it 3 stars is because it really only takes place in 2-3 spots.  The acting in this movie is also very blah like nobody really tried.  I don't suggest this movie at all.  If you want to watch a really good movie(s) about someone in a wheelchair or someone going through a hard time, I highly recommend Me Before You, and The Fundamentals Of Caring.  Those are two of the best movies I have ever seen!",1515369600,,594,4.113043478260869
8666088,4,B00LIAN5HQ,it had a lot of funny aspects but at the same time did not have a predictable plot. its short too so its worth the hour or so to see where the two friends end up with the girl. there's a deleted scene after the end credits by the way.,1452384000,,234,3.7

8666091,5,B00LIAN5HQ,"A Great Twisted Comedy about Friendship and Not So Friends!

I had to watch it to the end just to see how it turned out. Great story about best friends and not so best friends, but in the end I cant give it away! Twisted, funny, and truly enjoyable. Great cast! Great Indie! Definitely a must see!",1428883200,2,297,4.2105263157894735
8666092,5,B00LIAN5HQ,"An enjoyable, off-beat film with solid acting. Larry Fessenden, known for his roles in horror films, gives a great comedic performance. I watched this movie with my mother and she loved it. And mom is a notoriously harsh critic. But she smiled throughout. At least I think she was smiling. Its hard to tell now that the flesh has rotted away from around her lips. I should probably bury her soon.",1415059200,3,396,4.591549295774648
8666093,4,B00LIAN5HQ,"Entertaining story of old ""friends"" reconnecting under unique circumstances that really cause them (and us) to question the meaning of friendship. Some funny moments and solid performances by the entire cast including Kristen Connolly (House of Cards), Cody Horn (Magic Mike), and Larry Fessenden (You're Next). Worth checking out!",1415059200,5,331,5.775510204081633
8666094,5,B00LIAN5HQ,"Excellent indie comedy! Quirky, fluffy, biting, and dark, it rounds the bases, making for a tremendously satisfying watch. The highlight of the film is its eclectic cast, populated with recognizable character actors, some of whom you know off the bat, some of whom you're sure you've seen before but just can't quite place where. And some terrific newcomers as well, particularly Richard Tanne and Noah Barrow, playing the titular ""Worst Friends."" And some damn good music too! Cool cinema at its finest.",1415059200,7,504,5.158536585365853
