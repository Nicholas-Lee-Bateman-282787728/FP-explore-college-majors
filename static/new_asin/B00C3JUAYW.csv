5689835,4,B00C3JUAYW,"This was a very good anime. Not as good as the first Queens Blade series but still worth a buy.  I thought it was entertaining.  Not for kids, plenty of fan service and some scenes that were a bit more adult.",1383264000,6,208,4.048780487804878
5689836,4,B00C3JUAYW,"The Queen's Blade series is decent in terms of storyline and production value.  Of course one the main reasons for any fan buying the series is for the fan service.  So if you don't like fan service, you can give this anime a miss.  That being said, even in the absence of the obvious titillating features of the anime, the story still entertains.  Not one of the best of all time, but adequate.

The only let-down here is the fact that the Blu-Ray collection has almost no extra features (clean opening and closing songs don't count in my book).  There is no animation in the menus, just one completely static page to make your selections.  No commentaries, behind-the-scenes, character bio pages, artwork, mini-games, etc.  Very low-budget.  In some ways this is understandable, considering that US customers are too cheap to fork out money for their favorite series (they would rather spend hundreds of dollars on their smart phones and ridiculously expensive phone service so that they can keep their noses in facebook all day).  The Japanese versions of all the anime series are MUCH more expensive and contain fewer episodes per disc, yet Japanese customers/fans will support the companies/titles.  Sad state of affairs here.

Anyways, to sum it up: good series, bad (read: NO) Blu-Ray features.",1382659200,6,1301,4.972222222222222
5689837,2,B00C3JUAYW,"90% fan service
10% plot

There really feels like something is missing between this release and the last ones.  Some how returning characters have completely different personalities and the story is extremely sparse up until the last episode. Every time something starts to develop into something interesting they move away with more fan service and a different direction.  I lol'ed pretty hard at the melona clone then at the end they were like SURPRISE ITS REALLY MELONA ..... yeah I kinda figured that one out when she looked and sounded exactly the same.

If this is your thing you already own it, if you want to try this series out wait for a price drop, or check out the originals they actually have a decent story.",1382140800,3,721,4.698412698412699
5689838,4,B00C3JUAYW,"Queen's Blade is a rather new and famous anime title when if comes to fan service. In fact, I would say that the Queen's Blade series is probably the best of the fan service genre, despite it being ridiculous. This new release is no exception. At first I thought that Rebellion would be a little more tame, but that is not the case here. There is one character (Luna Luna) in this new series that has such a ridiculous outfit that she makes Echidna's snake underwear from the first series almost look normal.

This season of Queen Blade is about a rebellion who opposes the new tyrannical queen, who is actually Claudette, the main character's older sister from the first series. The new main character is a violet hair colored girl named Annelotte Kreutz. She is a knight who befriends many of the unusual characters in the show.

In the first series, many of the characters looked like they were from a fantasy story and actually looked like women instead of cute anime characters with big eyes. Not all the characters followed this, but I feel enough of them did follow this trend. This series seemed to use more anime looking character designs for the cast. There are a lot more young girl characters this time, and it feels kind of weird seeing them in a show which has tentacles, an octopus, fragile armor, and suggestive religious poses. One of the characters (Mirim) looks way too young to be in this show; she looks like Mint from the series, Galaxy Angel, and she obtains something called the ""Hyper Vibration Armor."" It just seems wrong that she gets this armor opposed to anyone else. The first time she appeared on screen, I thought that she looked too cute to be a regular cast member for this show, so she would be delegated to a random villager role, but no.

New character tropes include: a pirate, an alchemist, an automaton, a samurai, twin Chinese sisters, a dancer, a nun, a warrior slave, a devoted housewife, and others. There are enough characters to pique the interest of any heterosexual male. Speaking of which, this is obviously a show for teenage boys or men who act or think like teenage boys. There are a lot of clothes getting ripped or torn, or tentacle-like objects. Girls probably won't get much out of this show, unless they feel empowered by a rebellion led by young women. However, Code Geass is a way better story about a rebellion. This is also probably the only time someone would compare Code Geass to Queen's Blade.

Notably the English dub is the same from the first series, which is done by the people at Media Blasters, not Sentai Filmworks. If you have seen the first series, then you know what to expect.

Overall, the series is a very fun fan service show, but do expect ludicrous situations. The DVD or Blue Ray release comes with 2 music CDs, which is very nice. I just wish this was available for more anime. This collection also has some audio dramas and short OVA skits. These OVAs are even more perverse than the regular show, just like the OVA shorts for the first series.",1380931200,3,3028,4.589648798521257
5689839,4,B00C3JUAYW,"The first Queen's Blade series is a silly joke of an anime meshing together seemingly incompatible character designs for a product that was at its best barely watchable. With the release of the second season, it became evident that the joke had been taken too far. The creators sat down and fleshed out a surprisingly deep background story for this paltry smut. Why would anyone take the time to try and pull anything compelling out of softcore porn? But that's why I love Japan.

My curiosity was piqued when I learned that Claudette had become the queen, and not Leina. To my dismay, the female lead this time was not Leina Vance, but a new character by the name of Annelotte. Although I hated the idea of an entirely new cast of characters, I found Annelotte to be surprisingly amiable. Whereas Leina failed as a protagonist for the first thirteen episodes, Annelotte begins her story more favorably. Initially, she is a weak noble heir on the run, evading assassins and hiding her gender; but is saved by the Elf Instructor Alleyne. Displaying great humility, and abandoning her guise, she undergoes Alleyne's harsh training and emerges a formidable female warrior.

This is where the real story starts... but I won't ruin that.

I liked how previous contenders from the first two seasons make occasional cameo appearances. From the looks of it, every single contender from the previous Queen's Blade has been cursed by the Swamp Witch. With the exception of Claudette and Elina they can't fight at full capacity, so it makes sense that they would be reduced to tertiary roles. I like the, ""gone but not forgotten"" aspect of the older characters.

With a new cast, a new tyrant, and the hint of foreboding presence from the Swamp Witch; this sequel really kicked off to a good start here.",1374451200,7,1792,4.789644012944984
5689840,5,B00C3JUAYW,"If you thought the original Queen's Blade series could not be topped,you will be delightfully surprised at this,the third ""season"". Claudette,the Thunder General and the oldest sister,is queen. She has abolished both the nobilities and the Queen's Blade tournaments and declared herself the eternal queen. Rebellions are rising and new heroines are introduced.
There is Yuit,an elf and editor-in-chief of a newspaper and her constant companion,a ""female"" robotatic warrior named Vante that wears pink panties and has serious real-looking hooters,
Liliana, the bodacious female pirate captain of a flying square-rigger,
Mirim,an innocent,sweet-hearted and hard working teenager that is impressed into servitude by the Iron Strategist for Claudette,
Ymir,who was the Iron Mountain Dwarf in the previous series but is now the Iron Strategist and one of the central characters of this series,
The Ragged Warrior,this series heroine who is the last of the Kreutz nobility;
Elina,the ever-horny incestious youngest sister of Claudette and Liena;
Leina the Wandering Warrior and principle herion of the original series now in a much-reduced role and one that seems to have narcolepsy as she suddenly falls asleep,( for reasons that are probably meant to be discovered in the next season);
the previously defeated queen is now a new bride with amneasia,
The most outrageous new cast memeber is LunaLuna,the Sun/Moon Dancer that would be less provocative wearing nothing at all instead of the ""ceremonial"" false penis that she uses to good ""effect"" to open the temple door. As quirky as she is,she adds immeasurably to the story.
Melona,the ""pink rabbit"" minion of the Swap Witch,makes a late but critical appearance;
The new angel in charge has an orthopedic wing;
Add two dine-and-dash sisters,an Inquistioner that gives a blessing by hoisting her skirt...and an octopus.
There are magic stones when placed on a females ""three points"" can turn a sweet girl into a unstoppable warrior,and a woman with dragon blood in her veins that is the slave of a gremlin...
Well,you get the picture. This is sheer delight and fun and,quit frankly,more entertaining than the prevous series. Highly recommended for late (17+)teens and adults.",1368489600,28,2220,5.382183908045977

5689854,5,B00C3JUAYW,"I've been watching Queens Blade since Exiled Virgin and I love it! This series, QB Rebellion, is just as good and almost better in some aspects of the entire series. Awesome voice acting, seemingly better action sequences than even the first two series, lots of nude boobs -w-, interesting and adventurous story, and beautiful artwork. Did I mention how good the voice acting was? For a series like this, it's amazingly good. They even got Vibe Jones (same voice actress who was Nariko in Heavenly Sword) in this xD!! I must say tho, I was quite surprised when I found out just who Vibe Jones was in QB Rebellion. At first I thought it was the chick who played Genkai from Yu Yu Hakusho who was also in Queens Blade but in the earlier series. But as the story progressed I definitely could hear Nariko's voice a couple episodes in. I never thought she would be in a series like this. I was thoroughly surprised when I found out. And her voice seems slightly more mature than her character... but I still love it! I easily got used to it after a few episodes. I was like ""Nariko! Yay!! =D"". Oh yeah, and so far all the characters from the previous Queens Blade series that appear in QB Rebellion seem to have the same voice actors from the older series. Another major plus! And I think each disc has a couple special features in them too. This series does not disappoint! It'll have you craving for more! I still haven't finished QB Rebellion solely because I keep going back and watching my favorite scenes from earlier in the series ^_^",1440547200,4,1537,4.492857142857143

If you like fan-service you're probably well acquainted with the Queen's Blade series.  This was my second Queen's Blade title.  The animation is great, the Japanese voice acting is above average, and the variety of costumes/settings/situations is also great.  However, I found my interest slipping after each episode.  The series was posed to be great, but it lacked a compelling plot line and I stopped watching 7 episodes in.  I started watching again a month later just to finish the series.  Maybe it needed more fan-service, or a better plot?  It is a technically well done series, but it just wasn't interesting enough to rank higher than 3 stars.",1403827200,,731,5.025

5689883,2,B00C3JUAYW,"When Rebellion was announced as the the aftermath of the tournament caused by the actions of the previous characters, I was really excited what would happen in this arc. While the original source does a good job showing how bad the aftermath really is, the anime decided to not only tone down the aspect of how dark the plot was but also ramped up the fanservice for no real reason. Because Rebellion acts similar to season 1 focusing more on introducing the new characters, it ends up having even fewer action scenes than the previous season with the tournament and even season 1.

Picking up a few years after the original series, The Continent has gone to hell because Leina gave the spot of Queen to her older sister Claudette and while she did a good job originally, she is now ruling as a Tyrant, destroying anybody that opposes her rule. The new protagonist is the knight Annelotte who despises the rule of the Queen and leads an army called the ""Rebellion Army"" to bring down Claudette. Of course despite this being the summary, Annelotte spends more time just wondering around The Continent to see the damage Claudette does until near the end of the series where she decides to finally do something about it instead of it being a thing from the beginning. Because Annelotte is shown to constantly fight with the army though because of her strong sense of justice, she is on the run and wanted by Claudette.

The cast in comparison do not get that much develop in comparison to the first cast. This is a huge bummer when an entire episode is focused on said character but it doesn't give them enough development to really care for them. You're more interested in what happened to the original cast who are doing anything when Claudette is power hungry. You only know that Elina the youngest sister is in full support of Claudette's tyranny and Ymir who directly works under Claudette. This is a plothole in itself because the anime has Ymir fight Leina while the original source has Ymir fight Claudette who breaks her weapon and the dwarven vow forces Ymir to work under Claudette. Ymir is also noticeable for having a costume switch from her cute white dress to a sexy black one.

The worse part is that characters like Izumi who is specifically part of the Rebellion only gets one episode to herself and doesn't join the army. And it also doesn't help that most of the Rebellion army is weak in comparison to the original cast and they spend more time getting beaten by any of the returning characters rather than actually show how badass they are. This is really depressing when you realize that Mirim is stated to be one of the more powerful characters in the franchise because of the armor that Ymir made for her.

Another annoying thing is how Nanael was supposed to return as a character in Rebellion but due to real life issues, she was cut out of the series and replaced with half angel Lalia who serves no real purpose except to be the messenger from heaven to threaten Claudette that if she continues her ways then the Queen's Blade tournament will return. And this is despite having a huge backstory that is never touched upon even in the OVA where Nanael DOES return in an archangel outfit.

SPOILERS FOR ANIME ENDING BELOW.

The ending of the series is what really kills the anime though. Since there are only 12 episodes and 9 of the episodes are spent trying to develop the new cast, the last 3 episodes try to tie down all the plot twists into 3 episodes and explain what happened to most of the cast. However it was done so quickly and so poorly (and some of it wasn't even from the original source) that it's as bad as DEEN trying to handle the 4th arc of Umineko. And even then the most important information IS STILL NOT EXPLAINED to the point you have to look online to see what really happened because the anime ends on a downer while the original source at the very least did the same thing that the second series did showing what happened with all the characters at the end. There was none of that, just everyone getting their butt kicked by Claudette despite the original source, Claudette loses to Mirim of all people (but again shows how Mirim is one of the stronger characters in the franchise of the second cast) and the only reason Claudette doesn't kill them is because Leina shows up and then Claudette is literally like ""Whatever."" and then just leaves with no explanation of why she changed because Melona's explanation is only half right from what the anime shows (and the only difference in the anime from the original source is that Melona is captured by Lalia and will be taken to heaven for her crimes compared to the original source where she got away with everything she did).

SPOILERS END HERE

So overall, Rebellion is a huge disappoint in terms of story and characters. And I should probably add that there really isn't any point to the fanservice when this series is notorious for censoring the characters in a poorly done manner that even when the character is bathing, it comes off as a ridiculous attempt to hide what was already done in the first two season in no problem. So it even fails at the fanservice...(now whether or not the DVD is uncensored is another thing but I'm reviewing the series, not the DVD). If there was a season 4 then many of the things could be finished up but what we have now is Queen's Blade Vanquished Queen that focuses more on the old cast rather than the new cast. Plus Hobby Japan is already starting on a new series called Queen's Blade Griminore and are putting more effort into that then attempting a 4th season to tie up lose ends, so we're left with a poor representation of the original series. Not a good taste for Queen's Blade fans really.",1400198400,10,5741,4.55082284607938

5689896,4,B00C3JUAYW,"It has been several years since the end of the last queens blade.  But things have changed, the winner has left her throne in the hands of her older sister - who has become the thundercloud queen.  She has banned any future Queens blade events and also banned the remaining nobility.  However the people are a little more prosperous and happy, except for the lovely warriors who used to fight for the right to be queen and the enjoyment of the crowds.  But there is a light moving through the realm, a lone noble warrior who fights to help those she can and to bring a little justice to those who deserve it.  With her are a group of eclectic warriors who wish to follow her (and to get closer to her in any way possible) in her quest to bring down the queen and restore peace to the land.

I will agree while this did not have a clear plot the other series had, it still had an entertaining story.  The characters are what really make the story, old faces do show up or are at least mentioned, like Leana, Risty, and Aldra - but some of the new ones are just as funny, especially Luna Luna whose outfit makes Malice of the first series seem overdressed - and there is a perverted octopus.  Also on each disk there are some short stories which are small fillers, but are very entertaining (especially the pudding episode).  And there is the opening for a possible new series, but we will have to see if anything comes out (I am still waiting for Sekerei 3).  This is not for kids based on the Ecchi level, but if you like an action fan service series go for it.",1384387200,4,1561,4.261016949152542

5689898,5,B00C3JUAYW,"This is the third of the Queens Blade and probable the one that answers the question what happen to Queen Aldra's sister.  You also find out about Laina the wondering warrior. There is no shortage of action in the Rebellion and if your a big fan of ecchi than this is the one for you. I have heard a lot of people complain that it's not like Queen's Blade well it's not sapose to, it sapose to be the answer to the lingering question what happened? Look if every one was like the last then the series turns to mud, it has to go some where and tell you something. Besides theirs just to many great girls comming out of there close to care.",1383350400,,638,4.145161290322581
