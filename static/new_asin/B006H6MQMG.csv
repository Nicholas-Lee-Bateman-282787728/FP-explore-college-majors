8498218,5,B006H6MQMG,One of the best ski movies of all time,1422921600,,38,3.3333333333333335
8498219,5,B006H6MQMG,"This is the most beautiful back country ski film I've seen. The narration from ""Heart of Darkness"" works wonderfully to express the feeling of pushing one-self and exploring far ""off the beaten track"". The music is also great. The only ski movie I've ever been motivated to view multiple times (much less to own).",1386806400,,313,4.814814814814815
8498220,5,B006H6MQMG,"We  love the mountain, we love the snow... we love skiing... impossible  not to love this movie!

Enjoy it",1368489600,,179,4.0285714285714285
8498221,5,B006H6MQMG,"Probably, one of the best ski and mountain movie ever made: wonderful landscape, super story, action, meditation and so on",1364169600,,122,5.15
8498222,5,B006H6MQMG,"Truly amazing photography. An ambitious, beauty of a film. Inspiring. Buy this one! It will blow your mind! Yes it will my friend...",1342310400,,132,4.782608695652174
8498223,1,B006H6MQMG,"This movie has no redeeming value.  Mediocre skiing on terrible snow.  Frozen suncups and runneled South American Cement.  The whole concept is ""Solitaire"" which suggests people traveling solo in the mountains. Nope,they're in groups.
As a ski-mountaineer, I understand that the mountains offer much beyond great skiing.  I did not expect a Travis Rice video with the best riders doing the best tricks on the best snow.  Adventure and overcoming hardships are wonderful and inspiring topics in a ski movie.  An example would be Kyle Miller's Freerider.  ""Solitaire"" is a collection of random shots in the mountains of South America with no context.  Perhaps there are inspiring stories behind what the people in this movie are skiing, but you'd never know it.  The epic-sounding Spanish narration has no real content.
Its a shame because Sweetgrass put out ""Last Light,"" a short ski movie on youtube, that is the best ever made.

Don't waste your time or money!!!!",1337817600,,964,5.082802547770701
