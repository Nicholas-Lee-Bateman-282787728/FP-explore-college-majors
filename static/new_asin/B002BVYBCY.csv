3895382,3,B002BVYBCY,"Well I am totally new to music and guitars.  The dvd said it was for beginners....well maybe beginners who already know alot.  I am going to put it on the shelf until I learn a bit more somewhere else. Also, the camera angles make it hard to see the instructor's finger placement.",1267488000,8,280,4.365384615384615

8361984,5,B002BVYBCY,"I'm enjoying this dvd quite a lot, and gaining some knowledge for sure. It starts at a level below where I'm at, as I already knew a lot of basic chords, a couple power chords, basic 3chord blues progression patterns ect. A very beginner could start with this course, but knowing the strings, and notes on the lower fret board would help a lot. As the dvd progresses to learning the pentatonic scale and into soloing, which is where I'm at now, it becomes more challenging, and I'm liking it a lot, because I can actually put together some cool sounding licks and have fun with it. I have to say I like Mark John Sternal's teaching methods, and will be looking into his other dvd's as well.",1463011200,,690,4.3984375
8361985,1,B002BVYBCY,"Wouldn't play in ANY dvd player.
I tried several including laptop pc and mac book as well as blu-ray and just the good old fashioned DVD player.
No go, No, go, No go.
And now I am wasting my time writing a review and returning a product jut to recover a few bucks.",1380844800,2,264,4.0
