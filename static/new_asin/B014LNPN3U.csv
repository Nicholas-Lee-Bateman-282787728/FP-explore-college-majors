7417767,5,B014LNPN3U,"I love this series! Season 1 was hilarious and heartbreaking and Season 2 was just as good if not better, keeping the story fresh and taking some big risks that really paid off. It's great to see a LGBT series that avoids cliches and is honest about relationships in all their forms.",1447372800,3,283,4.461538461538462
7417768,5,B014LNPN3U,"I loved season 1 but season 2 is even better. This  season is beautifully filmed and the soundtrack is perfect. This season is less dark and has some laugh out loud comedy moments coupled with some really emotional scenes that make you feel really invested in the characters. Van Hansis and Kit Williamson are perfect in their roles as Thom and Cal, but the addition of other characters, including Willam as Douglas and Brianna Brown as Hillary, really adds something great to the story. EastSiders is often billed as an LGBT show but, to be honest, it's just a show about people - wonderful, flawed, real people who you will grow to love. Be forewarned, you'll get addicted This story and be ready for season 3 as soon as the credits roll on the last episode.",1447372800,7,760,4.588235294117647

8731388,5,B014LNPN3U,"WOW!!! It was a bumpy ride tonight. No wonder 'Eastsiders' caught on so quickly. It certainly has grabbed me by --- my attention. This is the kind of stuff I really like: good writing, good acting, good music, good direction, good production, good whatever. Good to know Season 3 is on its way.

Add on Jan. 14: I like this series so much I bought Seasons I & 2. Kit and Van are masters of their art - at least in my viewpoint. They are so convincing that it is easy to believe they are actually a couple going through some difficult times and changes in their relationship. Each time I watch, it is like looking in on a real-lives  - not just a made for TV drama.",1484092800,,664,4.1796875
8731389,5,B014LNPN3U,I loved Season 1 and could not wait to watch all of Season 2.  It had several laugh out loud moments as well as touching moments also.  Both seasons draw you into their world.  Besides seeing Tracie Lords was icing on the cake.  I have recommended this to several of my friends.,1468281600,,278,4.288461538461538

8731394,5,B014LNPN3U,"With the Eastsiders webseries Kit Williamson has created a world inhabited by LGBT characters unlike any you've ever seen before. Just when you think you've figured a character out, you get thrown a devastating curve. Each story, both hilarious and poignant is brilliantly told. Both seasons have been perfectly cast, however season two has an expanded cast with amazing actors whose stellar performances you absolutely can't miss!  Do yourself a huge favor and buy both season 1 and season 2. Then tell all your family and friends to buy them. Once you start watching, you won't want to miss a single minute!",1447459200,5,609,4.970588235294118
