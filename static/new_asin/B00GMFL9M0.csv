8624582,3,B00GMFL9M0,"Matt (Mark Harris) is a grease monkey and former boxer who takes a holiday to the states with his family. Not just any place, but the city where children are kidnapped and sold to childless parents without adoption papers and where young girls are also forced into prostitution, especially if they are English tourists.

Matt's little girl Lara (nicely played by Honor Kneafsey) is kidnapped in what was a set up from the on set. With his wife beaten into a coma and his daughter missing, police suspect the boxer with an arrest record. With the help of a street wise stranger, Matt goes Charles Bronson all over the bad guys while easily avoiding the cops.

One of the nice things I noticed about this film is that the kidnapped British teens were given the same treatment as their kidnapped non-English speaking counterparts. Just makes one proud to be an American.

This is another ""Death Wish"" type of film. It has a some differences, but basically it is a vigilante film. The acting and plot were okay, but then again this type of film doesn't require too much.
