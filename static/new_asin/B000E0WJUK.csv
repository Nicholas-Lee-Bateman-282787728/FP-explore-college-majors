2478692,5,B000E0WJUK,"Loggerheads is a tender yet tortured movie about a son who is drifting (Kip Pardue playing Mark), a biological mother pineing away about the fate of her baby (Bonnie Hunt playing Grace), and an adoptive mother torn between her beliefs, her marriage and the the man her son has grown to become (Tess Harper playing Elizabeth).

The writer and director (Tim Kirkman) carefully lays the foundation of this multi-layered story by crafting the storylines that drive each character to the point which they are at. Loggerheads takes head on: sealed adoption files, the conflicts that erupt in a religious family and a gay son and finds time to have a tender romance blooming under the balmy beach sun. This movie is not lite by any means, but really stirs up feeling of comparsion for Mark (lost and needing a mother), fustration (as Grace races to find him) and forgiveness (as Elizabeth learns the about the time she has wasted away from her ill son).

Loggerhead is an ideal title, for a creature such as a turtle that is both strangely beautiful and secretive, yet relies on the mercy and protection of others to defend it from poachers and environmental destructuon.....so does children, adoptive or not, rely on loving partents to thrive.",1146441600,12,1237,4.85781990521327
2478693,5,B000E0WJUK,"Loggerheads is one of those movies that touch you in a way that stays with you long after the credits roll.  I had the pleasure of watching this incredibly beautiful movie this past weekend and I am still mesmerized by it.  I find myself sad with an aching heart knowing that Loggerheads was based on a true story and knowing that there were all these people effected by the NC adoption rules of the time.

I ache for the birth mother longing for her son that she was forced to give away at birth. I am sad for the adoptive mother that, be it through religious beliefs or how she was brought up to believe, let her adopted son go away and never be sought after.  But most of all I ache for the son, the baby abandoned by a birth mother, abandoned a second time by an adoptive mother and yet still manages to hang on to life and try to do something good, such as saving the endanagered sea turtles on the North Carolina Coast.  All the while, underneath, harboring a belief that he was never wanted by anyone.

The casting of this movie was excellent.  From Bonnie Hunt who played Grace, the birth mother, to Tess Harper, the adoptive mother, Chris Sarandon, the adoptive father and Michael Kelly, the man whom Mark (played by Kip Pardue) befriends and finds a kindard soul.

The outstanding member of the cast, for me, was Kip Pardue.  Not only did he lead the movie with the grace that was needed, he pulled through on every scene and made me love Mark so much that I cried when he hurt.  Kip is a beautiful man, no doubt.  Much like a model, he's so beautiful.  But, that's the outside.  I don't pretend to know him, but he brings a presence to the screen, almost like an angel effect.  He seems so sweet, so kind.  This is exactly what I believe was needed to make Mark our angel.  Perfect work, amazing job!

And Michael Kelly, with his kindness and sincerity, he brought George to life in such a way, that I wanted them together from the moment that they introduced themselves.  One of my favorite scenes was when George gives Mark a place to stay and Mark mistakeningly thinks that it is in return for sex.  A ""barter situation"".  George quickly informs him that it's not and he doesn't ""need to barter"".

Tim Kirkman created a very moving and beautiful movie with ""Loggerheads"" and I thank him for sharing it with me.  I will purchase it and recommend to any of my friends to purchase it.  It is amazing, mesmerizing and will leave you with your heart still attached to it.  I promise.",1146441600,16,2492,4.379084967320262

2478695,5,B000E0WJUK,"One of the rare gems of the 2005 Verzaubert International Queer Film Festival in Munich Germany, Loggerheads is an excellent film that really stood out among the pack of mediocre films that played the festival. This film was not just one the best gay themed films I've ever seen but is also a great example of what filmmaking should be. Great story!",1145232000,7,349,4.645161290322581
2478696,5,B000E0WJUK,"Having been involved with adoption for over 25 years - and being personally acquainted with the birthmother - I wondered...could this film truly do justice to the issues that it was attempting to dissect on open screen?  And, it did!  This movie is an lasting tribute to those involved in adoption whose lives are caught in the balance of what we know to be the adoption triangle.  My only regret being that the birthmother was never able to give her son the depth of her love ~ what a much better world this would have been for that one act of connectivity to have occurred.  The ability to find healing of broken hearts and spirits should never be legislated, as so many states have and continue to attempt to do over the decades.  I recommend this movie to anyone wishing to embark upon a journey which many of us have already taken in one form or the other.",1143244800,15,861,4.424050632911392
2478698,5,B000E0WJUK,"Excellent acting along with the extraordinary Directing by Kirkman who also wrote the screenplay. I enjoyed Grady Harp's review so much I viewed the movie on Netflix before I decided to purchase it a week ago.  This is one of the best low budget movies you will get, and the acting is so good you forget it is an Indie film, and Tim's screenplay and directing is so professional I am surprised we haven't seen more from this gifted professional.
I loved how everything fit together so nicely but if you watch Kip Pardue's interview on the DVD he explains that it does, and how he was drawn to it.  Only once in about 25 to 30 stories do I get totally involved and want to watch a movie over and over, but this one hooks me.  I do love happy endings, that is why I like the cinema but this one is a little more real and not so much fantasy and more ""it is what it is"".
A complete description of the movie under reviewer Grady Harp will give you an in depth of the storyline and get you started.  Highly recommended 08192014 5.0 stars.",1408492800,,1033,4.228426395939087
2478699,5,B000E0WJUK,"Between 1945 and 1973 thousands of babies were surrendered for adoption by their single mothers. Loggerheads is the story of the three people involved in one adoption set against the backdrop of how the baby Loggerhead turtles hatch from their nests in the sand and head for the sea.
 The adult gay male adoptee, rejected by his  adoptive father, identifies with the infant turtles as they head for the sea to find their mothers. His adoptive mother, played by Tess Harper, is caught between loyalty to her husband and love for the son she raised. Meanwhile, the man's birthmother decides to search for her lost son. Set on coastal North Carolina, the film is beautifully textured and supports the metaphorical relationship between the alienated young man and the abandoned turtles fighting to survive in a hostile environment.  This film addresses contemporary issues such as adoption reform, family preservation, LBGT acceptance, and care for nature on several levels. Loggerheads is a precious gem of a film.",1392940800,3,1011,5.115151515151515
2478700,1,B000E0WJUK,Same somber poor gay guy with turtles this time and some sitting on the beach. Just like being stuck with a boring storyteller on a long road trip.,1371859200,2,147,4.285714285714286
2478701,5,B000E0WJUK,"Loggerheads is an awesome movie that is loosely based on the life of a young man named Tom Lightwater. I met Tom in the mountains of Boone,North Carolina in the early 1990's. I recall as if was just yesterday the conversation I had with him during the initial stages of our friendship. Tom told me that he had HIV and that if I entered into a friendship with him that by the end of it I would be sitting by his bedside holding his hand as he left his body and returned to spirit. I said that I knew he was in my life for a reason and there was no way that I would leave him before ever beginning our journey.

  Lightwater was a gifted,intuitive,masterful teacher and best friend. We spent hours and hours talking and sharing and walking and laughing and learning from one another. Lightwater taught me about how to live joyously as well as how to love unconditionally. When I would spend time with Lightwater and his partner Tim, I saw how even in the face of knowing one was going to die, that life was what happened in the meantime and that you better make it count.

  Tom passed away from AIDS related complications and did not have the opportunity to be ""found"" when his birth mother came looking for him. She did find me,and his partner, as well as many other individuals who were Tom's self-selected family. It was a tough life for Tom but he found a way to remain grateful for each moment, each person and every event which took place in his lifetime. Lightwater was transendental with his beliefs and left this lifetime with grace and a heart full of love. One of my favorite quotes that Lightwater always said was that life was like wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight and that when you died, you simply were removing the shoes.

  Loggerheads truly captured the essence of being adopted, struggling with HIV, and being gay in small town North Carolina. Tim Kirkman is a masterful director and somehow brought a very challenging and bittersweet story to the silver screen. Kudos the the actors and actresses who were in this movie as they were brilliant in embracing the truth beyond the story.",1357516800,5,2113,4.481770833333333

2478703,5,B000E0WJUK,"Super low-key indie drama that packs a surprisingly powerful emotional punch, this little film will be one of your highlights of the year's viewing. The script is quite good. There is some time-shifting involved that can be a little confusing, and it really hits home towards the end of the film. The acting all around is very well done, nothing overstated. No violence of any kind. What a relief from the usual Hollywood drivel. Do yourself a favor and watch this one.",1325030400,,469,4.7317073170731705
2478704,5,B000E0WJUK,"The basic tenet of the story is a man who end ups on the NC coast in an attempt to save Loggerhead turtles, while his own life is wasting away due to an incurable illness at that time.  There are no flashy displays, pyrotechnics, or loud music in this movie only superb dramatic acting with some haunting background music at appropriate times. I especially liked Chris Sarandon, as the young protagonist's preacher father, who while trying to help others while at the same time being a bigot towards his own son. It turns out that the young man was adopted so he has two mothers.  Tess Harper as his adoptive mother is stunning in her performance as was Bonnie Hunt as the birth mother in her role.  Michael Kelly as the small town motel owner and friend to Marc played by Kip Pardue, the wannabe savior of the Loggerheads, was totally believable in his role.  This was a sleeper of a movie, that many including I had missed on its original release.  It is one of the few movies I can say I will watch again. If you like real drama, this movie is hard to beat or forget.  Kudos to all the actors in it.",1316822400,2,1102,4.325242718446602
2478705,4,B000E0WJUK,"It's so refreshing to see an American film which has subtlety, mystery and beauty. It cleverly tells the story of an adopted child, his biological mother and the adoptive parents. The trauma experienced by each of them is touchingly and convincingly portraid and it takes some time for the characters to fall into place in the plot. That is a good thing, since it leaves something to the imagination of the viewer, creating a sense of anticipation right up to the last minute. Undoubtedly very sad, but none the worse for it.",1286496000,2,525,4.717391304347826
2478706,4,B000E0WJUK,"This movie took a while to get going, but soon I found myself caught up in an interesting web of a story. The stories components are beautifully woven together throughout the movie and eventually intersect triumphantly at the films conclusion; not your average story telling, but rather a seasoning of individual character stories that eventually intersect. I really thought this story was masterfully told, though some may find it a bit slow or difficult to follow, I enjoyed the journey. As a whole I felt the leads did a fine job, however at times some of the scenes or dialogue seemed a bit Trite. All and All I liked this movie and was moved by the performances; it might not be an academy award winner, but it did tug at my heart strings a bit.",1256774400,,750,4.562962962962963
2478707,2,B000E0WJUK,"At the beginning of 'Loggerheads', we're introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make matters even more confusing, we're informed (via titles on the screen) that the action is taking place in three separate time lines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a great deal of time but eventually we come to see how the three pairs are related: Mark Austin, a young man in his 20s, gay and HIV Positive is estranged from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin.

Mark is now a drifter and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town, where he meets George (sensitively played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and they eventually become involved with each other. Meanwhile, Mark's birth mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has come to the point in her life where she has decided to find the son she gave up for adoption when she was 17. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother, also has decided to track her estranged son as she misses him (despite the misgivings of her homophobic minister husband).

'Loggerheads' we're told is based on a true story and that perhaps is its Achilles Heel. Director/Writer Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes fraught with dramatic tension where there is very little to be found. Take Mark and George--they're both sensitive souls who have little to disagree about. There's some slight tension when Grace faces off against an Adoption Agency Director who is forbidden by law to give her any information about her lost son as well as a slight conflict with her mother who denies that she disapproved of her when she became pregnant as a teenager. No sparks fly either between Elizabeth and Robert since the good Reverend has adamantly insisted from the beginning that he has no intention of reconciling with his son.

'Loggerheads' is similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' in that the gay couple are the good guys and the straight males (for example, the Kure Beach cop and the Reverend) are the baddies. The biggest letdown of the movie is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between Mark and either one of his 'mothers'. Mark is already dead before either the birth or adoptive mother has a chance to reconcile with him.

Kirkman's theme is both a plea for tolerance and an exhortation for family members to express their heartfelt feelings before it's too late! Kirkman's sentiments are for the most part well-intentioned but they do not make for good drama. Loggerheads moves along at a snail's pace without providing any new revelations (or suspense) regarding such topics as AIDS, Adoption and Homophobia. Ultimately 'Loggerheads' fails due to a lack of originality.",1236988800,3,2685,4.933628318584071
2478708,4,B000E0WJUK,"Tim Kirkman is a gay filmmaker whose first documentary was ""Dear Jesse"" about North Carolina's Senator Jesse Helms.  His second film was a gay feature ""The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me"" about AIDS.  This film is about more than just the one story line of a gay man who likes turtles.

Bonnie Hunt who was nominated for two Golden Globes for ""Life With Bonnie,"" a sitcom that actually made me laugh, and debuted in ""Rainman"" as a waitress, plays a dramatic role as Grace Bellamy, a woman who regrets having given up her baby for adoption and longs to know what happened to him.  The issue of adoption brought to mind the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bella/dp/B0014BQR6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bella</a>&nbsp;that is also very beautiful.

Michael Learned who will probably always remembered for ""The Waltons"" for which she received numerous Golden Globe nominations plays Grace's mother Sheridan who forced the decision on her teenage daughter.  While Sheridan acted in what she thought was best for her daughter's future, we still regard her as heavy-handed as life sometimes takes us in unexpected directions.

Kip Pardue was in ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel Washington, ""Driven"" with Sylvester Stallone"" and starred in a smaller feature ""South of Pico"" last year.  His reddish blond hair and blue eyes give him a Redford-like leading man look.  As Mark, he plays a young man suffering from AIDS, having left a rigidly religious household that could not accept him as gay.  Pardue does a good job, but Kirkman doesn't elicit a deep performance from him.  Rather than the seeing the conflicts of knowing that life will be short, we see a nice young man having adventures as he roams about.

Ironically, Chris Sarandon -- who was formerly the husband of Susan -- earned his lone Oscar nomination for 1975's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" where he played a transsexual opposite Al Pacino.  In this film he plays ""Reverend Robert Austin"" who is a hell, fire & brimstone preacher who watches his family fall apart and refuses to save it because of his religious convictions.  This brought to mind another excellent small film I saw recently called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forgiving-the-Franklins/dp/B0014065LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forgiving the Franklins</a>, also Carolina-based as is ""Loggerheads"" at Kure Beach.

Tess Harper whose Oscar nomination came for ""Crimes of the Heart"" in 1986 looks matronly as Mark's adoptive mother Elizabeth.  The scene at the conclusion of the film with the biological mother Grace and the adoptive mother sharing memories of their shared son is very touching.

Michael Kelly gives an excellent performance as George.  Kelly became known in ""Dawn of the Dead"" in 2004 and also appeared in ""Carlito's Way.""  As the gay motel owner, his performance is deep and touching as we see his grief over his departed partner, the compassion with which he treats other people and his moral stance that rejects Mark's misinterpretation that his kindness is offered as barter for physical attention.  It is a well-written and excellently portrayed performance.

Valerie Watkins turns in a nice cameo performance as Lola/Sharon who also stays and works at the motel.  I found this film touching.  The conclusion left a bit to be connected by the viewer, which may be a result of the editing.  However, ""Loggerheads"" is an excellent small film.  I enjoyed watching Bonnie Hunt's and Kip Pardue's comments on the DVD extras.  Enjoy!",1220054400,3,3549,5.384057971014493
2478709,4,B000E0WJUK,"This is a Strand Releasing movie dealing with the unfortunate and serious issues of being gay and the AIDS virus. Beautiful Kip Purdue (Remember the Titans) plays Mark, an environmentalist who is interested in loggerhead turtles on the shores of North Carolina, he has also runaway from home when he was a teenager, because he got caught kissing another boy and being gay, and his parents not approving of his behavior.  He is dying due to the AIDS virus, which is really not explored in the movie, it is more of a circumstance to further develop the story line. This movie is apparently based on a true story. And it is told in a different periods of time, this is subtle, and you don't realize it until the end of the movie.

Mark is an adopted child, whose parents are devout, religious people (his father is a minister.) He meets George, a motel owner, in the sleepy seaside town of Kure Beach, North Carolina. Mark is sleeping on the beach while watching loggerhead turtles. George, Michael Kelly, is also gay. George takes him in, and their relationship flourish. George is a widower (his previous partner dies of an accidental drowning). George was hesitant to get romantically involved with Mark, but he finally gives in and lives with him until his death. Again this is not apparent in the movie but you deduce that is what happens.

George is in contact with Mark's grandmother who tells her his whereabouts and condition. She in turns tells her daughter Pattie (Mark's mother.) Robert, Chris Sarandon, Marc's father does not want to forgive him. In the meantime, Grace, Bonnie Hunt, Mark's biological mother, is looking for Mark. She finds him through an orphaned advocate who believes in re-uniting birth parents with adopted children for a fee. At the end of the movie she talks to the adopted mother and George (again this the subtlety of time differences.)

The movie outlines the lives of all these characters, all connected to Mark. Because the movie plot occurs in separate times, you have pay close attention to what is happening. There is obvious tones of negative judging about acceptance and being gay throughout the movie. The movie is matured, well crafted, directed, and produced, it is designed as a novel. There is an excellent cast with some old powerful actors. Probably the movie will not be embrace by all age groups.",1200096000,7,2348,4.804455445544554

2478712,5,B000E0WJUK,"Why am I always behind on good movies?  Plus, *Loggerheads* is one of those rare gay movies that are worthy to watch.  It is not entirely a gay movie but it does seem to be a common theme throughout as there are three different things happening.

Grace Bellamy (Hunt) is living with her mother.  After a failed suicide, she decides to find a boy that she had given up for adoption when she was 17.  While dealing with issues with her mother, Grace hires some sort of a private investigator to find information on her son.

Robert and Elizabeth live in a quiet family neighborhood in North Carolina.  Robert is a reverend and spends most of his time at his church.  Elizabeth is one of those nosy ladies that constantly check through the window on the neighbors.  Things are happening that she feels the neighbors will complain when it is just her. There's a couple of things going on that is keeping Elizabeth busy.  First, she believes that a gay couple, with a kid, has moved in across the street.  Secondly, another neighbor has put up a nude statue of David in the front yard.  The reverend urges her to invite them to church and to convince a neighbor to take down the statue.

George runs a motel at Kure Beach.  He's gay and everyone in this little town knows it and do not make it a big deal.  Mark is a newcomer.  He comes to check up on the loggerhead turtles, since they are endangered.  George and Mark strike up a friendship, which Mark confides that he is HIV-positive.  While Mark is used to bartering with sex, George shows him that there's more to life and friendship than sex bartering.

*Loggerheads* is just simply a wonderful film that's low-key in drama and dialogues.  And it works!  It couldn't have been done better than to film it in North Carolina, where everything fits.  Good movie about redemption and closure.",1184025600,6,1840,4.52887537993921

2478716,5,B000E0WJUK,"I watched this film for a second time to confirm my initial assessment.  I found myself in tears each time.  As a gay man and an adoptee, I've spent a half century looking for that film, that book, that story expressing the constellation of truth which is my experience, my life.  In LOGGERHEADS, I found that truth.

The time line of the story seemed, at first, a not very straight line and the resulting uneasiness is really a part of the truth of an adoption triad. A biological mother never forgets her baby, especially on his/her birthday.  An adoptee never forgets his/her biological mother, especially on his/her birthday.  And, an adoptive mother never forgets that she shares her adoptive child with another mother some place, especially on the child's birthday.  As an adoptee, I've learned personally (and from other adoptees) that even fifty years does not lessen the uneasiness of place I inhabit in life.

Lastly, this film is a tribute to the love of mothers for their children and the love children for their mothers even in estrangement and separation.  In this way, LOGGERHEADS, is an important contribution to the many stories of our often complicated lifes and the superb performances, of each cast member, honor the humanity of each one of us.",1172966400,10,1264,4.869158878504673
2478717,4,B000E0WJUK,"Michael Learned, where have you been?  I was studying your face onscreen trying to figure out where I had seen you before.  You looked so gaunt and yet so streamlined in LOGGERHEADS I had no way of connecting you with the many characters you played in your heyday, except by the agonizing pain in your eyes.  As many reviewers have noticed, you must have been directed with exactly the same strokes as your fellow players Tess Harper and Bonnie Hunt, for all of you constantly wear the same expressions of anguish, as though each had been hit over the head by a giant rubber mallet, so we see nothing but shellshocked pain.  Then I remembered, you were on THE WALTONS.

And also I remember you played the part of Marlon Brando's wife in APOCALYPSE NOW and all of your scenes cut before release, which must have been painful for you.  That sort of broken look remained on your beautiful face all throughout LOGGERHEADS, for your character has a lot of guilt to burn off, for she forced her teen daughter to give up a baby and she's never been the same since.

I hadn't seen you, Tess Harper OR Bonnie Hunt in years and years, and all of you were just super in the movie.  I guess it's a truism that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with its actresses of a certain age, but happily you all got tangled up in this sophisticated, time travel picture, in which the many different seasons of a cute guy's life get explicated with thousands of close ups of your grief-filled eyes.  They should re-do this movie every year or so, and all of you could switch parts and next time you could play the minister's wife and Tess Harper the teen who gives up her baby, etc.",1170288000,,1658,4.409836065573771

2478719,4,B000E0WJUK,"Michael Learned was actually my draw to buy this film - I was just interested in what 'Mum Walton' was up to in her career. The film pulled me in from the start, however, I'm going to have to review the time sequence better (I did find that the only issue that prevented me from giving 5 stars after first watch.) As an adoptee myself, I always find it interesting to see how other men handle the issue. (I have not been interested in finding the birth mother.) The story wreaks of what I think is wrong with the south and this nation at the moment - the religious element is of little use to human kind when used against others.

Performances were excellent across the board and I think with the exception of Chris Sarandon's character the others seemed like people I'd like to meet. I am a reserved sort of viewer, but I felt there were no real issues in this film that would prevent someone +13yrs from watching. I think we are fooling ourselves to think we don't know at least someone who is gay no matter what age we are.",1169251200,7,1026,4.288659793814433
2478720,4,B000E0WJUK,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review of a movie purchased on Amazon. I purchased this as a gift and only viewed after it had been viewed and raved about. Boy, am I glad I did. Loggerheads is a very well made film that tells three very real stories in an honest manner. I could go on and on about the acting and writing, but others have beat me to the punch.

More than anything, I want to respond to the comments made by the reviewer at the bottom of the page. It is unfortunate that the writers couldn't get past their own predjudices to see the message that this quiet little movie made. Perhaps it is a film whose message hits too close to home. It is just this small mindedness that the film wishes to address. Perhaps if all parents who have shunned their children who are ""different"" or in their eyes, ""have made a mistake"" the heartbreaks in the film wouldn't have occurred. I can only say to these people, view the film again with an open mind. If you can't find it in yourself to do this, give it to a friend. This movie should be viewed by anyone with a heart.",1167955200,11,1094,4.184834123222749
2478721,2,B000E0WJUK,"This film had a lot of potential--interesting premise, compelling characters and a strong cast--but something keeps it from gelling into a satisfying story.  There's a flatness to the film that is probably the fault of the director.  The above-average cast, that includes the wonderful Bonnie Hunt, Michael Learned and several other very likable young actors, seems squandered somehow by a lackluster dialogue and unrelenting low key tone.  The redemption that this viewer wanted to see emerge from the script at the conclusion didn't quite make it.  A pity as, despite the film's continuing weaknesses, I wanted more than melancholy for its lead characters.",1166745600,6,658,5.359223300970874
2478722,1,B000E0WJUK,"It is interesting that my previous review of this movie was removed from this web site; I guess the judgment of millions of people throughout recorded history is 'inferior' the latest notions.  If they let this one stand, I'll just say that my wife and I were utterly outraged that the seemingly adoption-friendly description on the DVD cover turning into anti-religious faith bigotry.  Anyone who has any sense of traditional morality, especially that rooted in the wisdom centuries of religious faith, should avoid this movie.  I'd better not say what this movie is really about lest they censor this one as well.  How many other negative reviews have been written here about this dishonest movie have been censored?",1163289600,4,718,5.059322033898305
2478723,5,B000E0WJUK,"I fully expected this ensemble film to be so syrupy sweet with sentimentality that I just assumed I wouldn't like it.  But it was quite the opposite and I was quite wrong - instead, I found a wonderful work of art that was so genuine and full of the realistic subtleties of life.  It was totally captivating and had such heart!  I cared about the characters and their often flawed, yet deeply felt emotional responses to the great challenges in their lives.  I can't believe I knew nothing of this film until a few months ago.  I don't remember its theatrical release at all!  It just makes me wonder how so many terrible films can make their way into theatres, while little gems like LOGGERHEADS disappear into oblivion.  Go figure.....",1160784000,9,737,4.623076923076923

2478725,5,B000E0WJUK,"I found ""Loggerheads,"" to be a profoundly moving film with deep roots that takes the viewer on a spellbinding journey through the interwoven lives of three people, whose life changing decisions all come to a head over a Mother's Day weekend in different sections of North Carolina.

What makes the film so unique is that it takes place over a three year period, jumping back and forth between the years and captivating the viewer with the truly difficult and life-altering decisions that the characters have to make.

This captivating film is accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that adds greatly to the impact of the film and characters. The eloquence and intricacy of the story line, combined with the intensity of the characters leaves the viewer spellbound. ""Loggerheads,"" is an artistic and masterfully produced film that is based on a true story. The characters are real, nothing is over done, all of the dialog is low key, subtle, yet profoundly effective and incredibly moving. This film is not your usual Hollywood drama, it is so much more than that. The actors do such a fine job that you are left wondering if they are acting at all. This is a genuinely moving film that will take you on a realistic journey that could happen to any of us. All of the pieces of the film come together at the end. It's the kind of film that you watch and then when it's over, you sit for several minutes trying to absorb all that you have just seen. It is a life like and down to earth story and I highly recommend it to all.",1151884800,38,1532,4.587591240875913
2478726,5,B000E0WJUK,"Loggerheads are turtles, found along the coast of North Carolina, whose lives are unique in that the females always return to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs, hatch their young who in turn by moonlight go out to sea only to return to their origin to repeat the life cycle.  The film by the name LOGGERHEADS relies heavily on this phenomenon: it is set in North Carolina and is guided by the young man Mark (Kip Pardue) who opens the story sleeping on the beach in Kure Beach, NC where he studies and protects the loggerheads.

A complex and challenging film, writer/director Tim Kirkman (The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me, Dear Jesse) calls upon a true story to bring up questions of adoption in all the permutations of the triad, homosexuality, religious intolerance, bigotry, AIDS, and the longing for love and forgiveness.  Kirkman sets his story in three years - 1999, 2000, 2001 - a fact that can be disconcerting until the flow of the film reveals the need to separate the events in time.

Mark is befriended by George (Michael Kelly) who is a kind young man, owning a motel, and who provides a room for the beach sleeper Mark.  Mark quickly informs George that he has AIDS, thinking that George's kindness is a barter.  But George is a true friend and their relationship grows slowly and with mutual trust as they learn the secrets of their pasts: George's lover 'drowned' in a mysterious accident; Mark ran away from his adoptive parents when they discovered he was gay; both men are tender and vulnerable souls afraid of further commitment.

Simultaneously we are introduced to Grace (Bonnie Hunt), recently recovering from a suicide attempt who longs to connect with the son she was forced to give up for adoption at age 17, and who lives with her rather rigid mother Sheridan (Michael Learned) who believes Grace should not try to discover the son she never knew.  We also meet the minister Rev. Robert (Chris Sarandon) and his wife Elizabeth (Tess Harper) who are fanatics about gay people and even resent their neighbor Ruth (Ann Pierce) who places a nude statue of David on her lawn.  The couple's son Mark is never discussed and the adoptive parents never communicate with him - but Ruth does.  Ruth finally confides that Mark is ill and the wounds of separation open for Elizabeth.  Meanwhile Grace has paid a 'finder' to locate Mark but the finder gives her a sad report.  The three years of the story line make exquisite sense at this point as we realize that Kirkman has allowed us to be voyeurs into a human drama of immense substance, one that inexorably binds these disparate characters.

The cast is genuinely fine, with Kip Pardue, Michael Kelly, Bonnie Hunt, Tess Harper all giving highly sophisticated performances.  But the credit for the impact of this stunning film goes to the writing and directing of Tim Kirkman.  He has a way with film that is unique: we can only hope he will continue to make films of this quality, films that tackle difficult issues and are molded into realistic, non-manipulated dramas.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, May 2006",1147996800,23,3097,4.75

8103701,3,B000E0WJUK,"Enormously frustrating. The first 3/4 were slow-ish but interesting. The acting was good and the cinematography and ideas were worthwhile. Then the last 1/4 it fell apart so badly it is extraordinarily frustrating. It is like maybe an actor quit or they ran out of money... no idea. But it started to get really unclear with jumping around in the timeline and a major event that the entire script was leading up to just sort of suddenly ignored and mentioned in hind-sight. Crazy frustrating. I hate that I wasted the time on it, and I hate that so much talent was clearly put into something that apparently was not clearly thought through by someone who knows how to tell a story.",1519344000,2,681,4.636363636363637

[spoiler alert here]

What didn't seem plausible to me is the fact that the main character had HIV and was refusing treatment. Perhaps it's because I grew up in the 80s. Or, perhaps I'm jaded because most of the movies in that era featured a lead actor that was dying. I just hoped for something that didn't require a tragic death from AIDS. The core of this movie was forgiveness, not HIV. There could have been other ways to explore that.",1429747200,,579,4.452830188679245
