3544259,5,B001DZOCZK,It was worth every cent just to see this delightful show COLORIZED and it really looks like it was filmed in living color. Highly recommended!,1286755200,5,142,4.72
3544260,4,B001DZOCZK,"For anyone who's a fan of the show, this DVD is worth buying. The color is actually pretty good. It doesn't look like it was computer generated. What puzzles me is why the people who put this together chose ""Family Portrait"" as the episode to colorize. While it's not a bad episode, it's far from being one of the best (a better choice would have been ""Grandpa's Call Of the wild"", or ""Hermans Happy Valley""). Perhaps they chose it because it was Beverley Owen's last episode before she left the show. Also, why is there only one episode? Considering this, the current price of $15 is a little steep. You may want to wait until the price drops to around $10, as I did.
 Still, a must for any fan of The Munsters. Recommended!",1283558400,7,725,4.41044776119403
3544261,4,B001DZOCZK,"I am a loyal and long standing fan of The Munsters Family. I am always guaranteed a great laugh when I see their television  shows/movies. The entire cast are so talented and funny, even Marilyn(the normal family member. It is a must have purchase. Enjoy the laughs!",1265155200,8,266,4.659574468085107
3544262,2,B001DZOCZK,Don't get me wrong. I don't have a problem with Universal putting out a single disc featuring the newly colorized version (along with original black and white version) of a 1st season episode of The Munsters. This allows people who already bought the two seasons of the TV series to bypass buying the complete series set. But for crying out loud! A list price of $19.98 and a selling price of $14 for one episode in two formats? What greed! This disc should have a list of $9.98. End of story!,1257120000,31,493,4.428571428571429
3544263,5,B001DZOCZK,"Awesome to see the Munsters in a colorized episode. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking to complete their Munsters collection.

I have a DVD player that does not take kindly to DVD copy protection. At one point it displayed the file menu. I hit play on one of the video files and an episode called The Midnight Ride of Herman Munster started playing, but with errors. Is there a secret menu on here that someone has figured out how to access and play other episodes?",1240531200,,476,4.471264367816092

3544265,5,B001DZOCZK,You can't go wrong with any new archive of Munster materials....  A total enjoyment of a very special television classic!,1236384000,4,121,5.05
3544266,5,B001DZOCZK,"I received my copy a bit early, and the color episode looks GREAT! Someone made sure they got the colors right because the clothes of the characters and their make-up match color photos I have seen perfectly. After viewing this color episode, I went to the black and white episode of the same show, and missed the color! This series is perfect in black and white and yet I think a lot of people will enjoy seeing this episode in color. I highly recommend buying it. I award the DVD five stars.",1222387200,22,493,4.369565217391305
3544267,5,B001DZOCZK,"In a bold yet shrewd maneuver, Universal Home Entertainment offers to Munsters fans who wish to avoid double-dipping with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Munsters-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001DZOCZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Munsters - The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;set this single disc release of The Munsters Season One episode ""Family Portrait.""

3544305,5,B001DZOCZK,"I enjoyed the ""Munster's Family Portrait"" the picture & sound quality was very good. I was surprised that the color tones weren't stronger. In the Universal movie ""Munster Go Home""  Herman's face colour was a stronger green which should have been used as a reference point also they should have colorized the end credits as they did with the opening credits.",1418860800,2,358,4.868852459016393

3544311,3,B001DZOCZK,"Colorazation still has not been perfected. And it's painfully obvious in this DVD. None of the backgrounds or long shots have ""color"". It seems that just the actors and some foreground objects have been colourized...So basically the overall feeling you get is frustration. Why ruin a classsic in this way. More than anything, it's an obstruction to the enjoyment of the episode...I say stick with the classic B/W version. Get the box set. Then sit back and laugh out loud. The Munsters are and always will be a classic show. 5 stars for The Munsters. No stars for the colouraztion process.",1374019200,3,589,4.841584158415841

3544316,4,B001DZOCZK,"Doesn't seem like enough really though, does it?  Both of the movies were in colour, and surely it's not just Family Portrait that's ever gonna' be shown in colour out of all the episodes.  They can do anything now, they could colourize anything if they wanted, and it surprises me nowadays why they don't do it, 'cos you'd think they would.  So in the case of The Munsters I ask, ""Is that it?  Is that the only episode ever to be done in colour?""
Most people now don't really wanna' watch black and white anymore, 'cos it's all moved on so much, I mean the technology's there, use it.",1321142400,5,585,4.339449541284404

8295656,5,B001DZOCZK,"Digital olorization of TV shows originally shot in black and white got a bad reputation some decades ago because of the relatively primitive techniques used in the 1980s (which were due to  poor artistic color choices as much as clumsy technical methods), and I had real doubts about this before I saw it, especially after seeing how the Munsters feature ""Munsters Go Home,"" originally shot in color had been butchered in the DVD transfer, with Herman being made artificially green in many scenes.  But after seeing about 15 seconnds of this, I was saying, ""Wow!  This looks fine!"" One of the best aspects of this beloved series was the Munsters' makeup, which was basically gray, but with a very subtle blue tint, even though Herman is occasionally referred to in the scripts as being ""green.""  So the colorists have let them be gray, but shifted it ever so slightly towqrd green, which doesn't let the bluish color that we have seen in the best color photographs of the cast show through but it looks real good anyway.  Lilly's dress is made to look pink, which is an error,(I think they were going for lavender, but it is too red-- the dress itself was originally white but diaphanous so that the pink of her un-made-up arms showed through).  The living room set was very rich in texture and that is really brought out in this, except that warm hues predominate, and the couch is yellow-- color stills taken at the time are very violet brown which is more appropriately spooky and drab.  The curtains on the Munsters coach colored yellow,and I remember them as matching the red seats (I have seen the Coach in person).  There is only one outright mistake, when an actor is peeking out from a doorway with his face half in shadow, they let it be too gray rather than darker flesh color, but that is minor.  This is not actually one of the best episodes, since it is mainly a farce with a lot of running around but no logic-- it  doesn't make sense that the family has two reporters from ""Event Magazine"" sleeping in their house but never meet them.  Fred Gwynne's makeup never looked better than in this epdisode and it was a joy to see. I wish other episodes would be colorized, too, it really brings the whole thing to life beautifully.",1462060800,,2240,4.5889724310776945

8295659,5,B001DZOCZK,"I have read poor reviews on this, but I do not agree with them.  True only one show, but the quality of the added color was true to form and added to the one show that was presented.  The only thing they could have added for the money would be the unaired ""pilot"" shown to the station guys.  I have it on VHS but have not seen it for sale on DVD yet.",1454457600,,350,3.767123287671233
