7343200,1,B0126ZKK56,"Nothing against the movies themselves (I really enjoyed Timothy Dalton's version of Bond to be honest), this is a complaint with the actual release of the collection itself.

It's a complete shame they did not include digital copies for this and the George Lazenby one. I thought these collections were perfect since fans of certain Bonds can select the ones they really like without purchasing the entire collection. But in this day and age, I am working on slowly converting my physical movie collection to the cloud so that when I'm not home I can have access to my movies wherever I go. It makes no sense that they would not include digital versions of these particular ones especially since UV codes are provided for all the movies if you buy the Complete Bond boxset.",1452297600,12,773,4.725925925925926

7343202,2,B0126ZKK56,"Unfortunately for Timothy Dalton and the entire James Bond crew, the Timothy Dalton era Bond movies were not successful.  It was probably the worst time for the series, one that today we look at and wonder still how and why.  The Old School Connery - Moore era was over to be sure, and now we were ready for a new man to take over the franchise.  We still are not reacting well to them, even though some say that Dalton was the precursor to Daniel Craig today.  True?  I'm not sure.

The two movies which are included in this package are The Living Daylights and License to Kill.  The Living Daylights is the last movie to use an original title from the original novels until Casino Royale in 2006, bringing us Timothy Dalton as James Bond, a new man in the role after many years with Roger Moore.  In this film they were attempting to use more realistic things rather than the camp and silly of the Moore films, and both were violent and harsh.  Did it work?  People complained a lot saying that they could not bring their kids to see these movies because they were so violent.  Well, they really aren't children's stories to begin with, they are for adults.  I think we had lost sight of that during the Moore and to some extents the Connery movies due to the fact that they had aged, the world had changed, and that during both of those times we were beginning to see a lot more violence in movies in general.  Honestly, neither is a great movie, they are okay.  The fault is primarily in the writing.  The storylines are rather choppy and hard to follow.  And Dalton?  Dalton was not a great James Bond.  He is a Shakespearean actor who does great things on the stage and screen in both America and Europe, but as James Bond?  He lacked a certain humor which we were used to seeing before, which Connery and Moore both possessed and we embraced.  In general, he was far too stiff and he wasn't all that sexy, he was a man to be feared rather than liked.

Still, I have the Timothy Dalton movies because they are part of the series like it or not, and I am a lifelong Bond fan.  They are, in most people's eyes, fans or not, the worst of the worst when it comes to the series.  But you buy them because you want a complete collection.  There are a few good moments here and there, but this was thusfar the lowest point for the series.",1444780800,,2337,4.295194508009153
7343203,3,B0126ZKK56,"Timothy Dalton's hammy performance as Bond was nothing to write home about, and neither was""License To Kill"", but ""The Living Daylights"" is a solid adventure.",1444089600,,158,5.36
7343204,5,B0126ZKK56,"Timothy Dalton is arguably the best James Bond. These two films balance his era perfectly and are among the best in the 007 series.

""The Living Daylights"" has espionage and romance, presented in a more elegant manner. The music score by John Barry is superb; and Dalton, a classically-trained actor, gives a performance that shows vulnerability, care and rage (watch the balloon scene).

""Licence To Kill"" has a more action-oriented premise with higher octane action and a superb villain (Robert Davi). The action is tremendous like when Bond escapes one perilous situation by waterskiing behind a sea-plane. Also, the tanker chase finale is among the best action ever presented on film, with Dalton doing a lot of his own stunts.

Highly recommended.",1443916800,24,752,5.147540983606557
7343205,3,B0126ZKK56,"I like Living Daylights. License To Kill was not as good but still ok. This Collection has no Digital Copy so it may not be a good deal if you have the movies already or did not like both of them. My rating reflects the lack of digital copies and the fact that there are better James Bond collections.

Start with Sean Connery Vol 1 and Daniel Craig Collection if you have not already done so. These will give you some of the best James Bond films with digital copies.",1443830400,,468,4.2

The actor playing 007 James Bond isn't the best Bond but not the worst Bond out all of them.  Personally I only liked one out of two of the movies but for only 6 dollars for each movie worth buying to have the whole set of Bond movies in my DVD collection.  If your looking to have the whole collection of 007 for your set then buy this DVD set and get it soon while Amazon is doing their black Friday sales because I got 3 Bond movies for 18 dollars so 6 dollars a piece.",1478995200,2,574,3.9310344827586206
