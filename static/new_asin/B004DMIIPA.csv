4332735,5,B004DMIIPA,"I first watched this a few years ago on Adult Swim and thought it to be unique and different from a lot of other anime. I watched the whole thing (6 episodes) only to want more. Sadly it ended, but none the less it left me more than not, satisfied. I liked the story, though a lil confusing the first time u watch, and the characters were cool. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to see a new mini-series that's unique in its own way. I give 2 thumbs up! I have now seen this anime at least over 10 times and it is great every time!

4332736,5,B004DMIIPA,"This show is incredible. My favorite animated thing ever - by far. That said, it was created for standard def.

4332739,1,B004DMIIPA,"I'm not going to go into the plot of FLCL, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation will yet again release another upscaled piece of garbage.

The video is grainy, lines are blurry in parts and pixelated in others, partly interlaced, distinctive gradient banding, it windowed (black bars on all sides; caused by 16:10 screens, not present in 16:9 ones) so the video isn't even 1080 by 4x3 standards, etc. See my comments on page 3 for screenshots, as well as the above image section.

This honestly is not worth your time or money, especially if you own the DVDs already. You will get the same quality playback on your Blu-ray player with the DVDs as you would this, as most all Blu-ray players upscale DVD anyways. Buy the DVDs or don't buy it at all.

This is being return the very next day as it is pure garbage. I really wish Funimation had their licences pulled for making these terrible releases.",1295481600,106,939,4.5773809523809526
4332740,5,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL is, quite possibly, the zaniest show I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Part comedy, part action, part sci-fi, part anime parody, and everything else in between, it is really just a story about growing up- with aliens and robots thrown in for good measure. Although it is only six episodes long, it is definitely worth owning, as it doesn't waste a single second. Every moment is used to it's fullest. I can't recall once being bored while watching. The art itself is original, as is the musical score used throughout. I've heard some complain about the story being hard to understand at first, but if you pay attention it's pretty straight foward. Whether or not you do understand it on your first go, this show has tons of replay value. The only other show I can think of to compare it to is Gurren Lagann (which I believe the same studio may have made). I've also heard some comparisons to Paranoia Agent as well, although I can't vouch for that one. However, if you enjoyed either of the aforementioned anime you may want to try this one out too. Personally, I'd suggest this to just about any anime fan, and possibly a few people who aren't familiar with the genre at all.",1294358400,5,1188,4.530232558139535
4332741,1,B004DMIIPA,"Okay look, FLCL is an awesome Gainax OVA from the late 90's- erly 2000's there is no denying that. The point of my rating however is for the upcoming blu-ray and not the show in general. So before anyone goes hog-wild trolling this review, do your homework. There is not a true Blu-Ray quality master of FLCL in existence at this time, period. The Japanese masters for this show were scaled and rendered in 480p. In 1999-2000 when this show was in production they did not have Blu-Ray in mind. Not saying that if they used Retas pro it could not be upscaled properly, and I don't mean upscaled in the video mastering sense i mean the animation drawings would have to be resized and still new masters would have to be made. Its really unlikely at that we are going to see a legit blu-ray at this point regardless. The Japanese Blu-ray is out, its beyond hidiouse looking, its a fuzzy mess, and it was produced by Gainax. You can find screen shots of it, but really don't bother with this.

Now that the US Funi blu-ray is out, all this is confirmed, This release is a blurry mes, it was a Q-Tec type upscale and looks like crayon.

 here are some screen caps @ 1080P

4332742,5,B004DMIIPA,"Anime can be pretty weird -- just look at series like ""Paranoia Agent"" and ""Boogiepop Phantom."" Really weird, sometimes impossible to totally understand.

But for sheer strangeness and kookiness, the winner has got to be ""Fooly Cooly (FLCL)."" Even as it pokes fun at typical anime, it tells the surrealist story of a very odd coming-of-age, complete with strange plots, oddball characters, and robots sprouting out of a young boy's head.

Naota is a young boy living what he sees as an oppressively dull existance, in a quiet city dominated by the Medical Mechanica building. The closest thing to excitement is fending off the advances of his brother's troubled girlfriend Mamimi.

Then sudenly a girl on a Vespa runs him over, resuscitates him with a smooch, and then bashes him over the head with a bass guitar. That evening, Naota finds that instead of a bump, he has a horn growing out of his head, and no idea what it is or how to get rid of it.

Despite his efforts to avoid her, Naoto's kooky father has hired the crazy Vespa girl, Haruko, as a housekeeper. To make matters worse, his ""horn"" turns out to be a robot and a giant mechanical hand -- springing out of a channel in his head. And you thought YOU had problems.

The five episodes that follow don't get any more normal, as Naota must deal with the Mayor's daughter getting his strange power, cat ears, more robots, baseball, bombs, the Pirate King Atomsk, seaweed eyebrows, and the interplanetary Medical Mechanica which may or may not be intent on galactic domination. It all clashes in the final episode.

For newbies, ""FLCL"" is probably the WORST anime to start with. It's a parodic mishmash of anime in-jokes -- giant robots, fanservice, boy falls for kooky abusive alien girl -- and a storyline that is bizarre to the point where you may not be able to understand what's going on. But oh, is it a fun ride.

As if the plot weren't hyperactive enough, the animation is exaggerated and crazy, full of distorted faces and wild robot battles. Lots of action and overdramatic dialogue (""OH NO.... OOOOOOOOO... an American GIRLFRIEND!""). As if it weren't funny enough, the director sprinkles in homages to other shows, ranging from other anime to ""South Park.""

And the characters are as bizarre as the story itself. Naoto starts off as a typical bored preteen, but slowly gains confidence and guts as he gets immersed in the weirdness. Haruko is a completely off-the-wall kook who is apparently an alien. And there's a bunch of other weird characters -- troubled pyromaniacs, wistful robots, preteen pervs, and a guy from Interstellar Immigration.

""FLCL"" is perhaps the strangest anime in existance. It's also enough to blow the top off of your head, with the strange characters and wildly surrealist plot. Fooly Cooly!",1290556800,138,2786,4.811715481171548

4332760,5,B004DMIIPA,"Originally done as a Gainax's first bite into the new millennium, FLCL(also called Fooly Cooly and Furi Kuri), this 6-episode OVA has recently been changed into an ongoing TV series backed up by Adult Swim. Being a meltdown of several anime tropes and gag humor, FLCL went on to being a genre-defining movement within anime, as well as American comics and animation.

Naota is a grade school student living in a small Japanese suburb whose popular older brother is in America on a baseball scholorship. This fame has an effect on Naota's trying to live up to his brother's image, as well as his resident ex-girlfriend Mamimi keeps clinging to him. One day, a crazy girl named Haruko shows up riding a scooter and hits Naota on the head with her guitar. This leads to Haruko becoming his family live-in ""housekeeper"", all while strange robots repeatedly keep appearing out of portal coming from Naota's head, which usually make him look like he's either sporting a horn or a pair of cat ears. This never really defined plot device has unexplained things like Haruko being an alien, a space pirate being captured by the enigmatic company referred to as Medical Mechanica, also a covert military organization keeping tags on all the parties involved. These usually lead to outrageous battles with runaway robots, and Haruko's constant changing from one anime cliche to another in devastating acts of violence filled with fan service.

The OVA made a large impact in the otaku community, both in Japan and America, but it soared after it was broadcast on Toonami in nearly endless 6-week loops. This embarked Cartoon Network to ride the current nostalgia train of continuing previous shows like Samurai Jack and Invader Zim by continuing it in two more 6-episode mini-series set for 2018. There was also a 2-volume manga done in a sketchier style based on the anime that was printed in English through Tokyopop. The OVA was first released by Sync-Point, also being one of the anime series that they actually completed before going bankrupt, and then re-released through Funimation. Even though this could've been released as a single feature like Read Or Die, but it works much better in its uncut episode-to-episode format.",1503273600,,2220,4.96505376344086

4332768,5,B004DMIIPA,"Off-theWall. Addictive. I could stop right there with my 5 starrating...but, a little more. The first time I saw this gem was on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. The otherwise obnoxious comments between breaks said something about this powerhouse anime creators produced FLCL as a sort of impulse series kinda like ...Mutant Turtles was. (Although TMTwas not initially meant to go public, it was an office joke...but then...). . One comment by CtnNtwkCtnNtwk was ""Wat a production as an afterthought."" (paraphrased). The other reviews give you more content but in brief, a 12  year old boy whose brother is in the US playing baseball is somewhat doged by his brothers' girlfriend, who para-seducespara-seduces  or she'll ""overflow"". (!?) Then the weirdness multiplies. There isn't enough room to summarise the details but the plot is...the boy is struck by the Vespa scooting guitar wwieldingirldingalien chick who is in love with some alien dude imprisoned in a black operation cove factory shaped like a steam iron. Bashing the protagonist kid with a guitar is to start a sequence of events to help spring her lover from the the iron...prison. I said it was off the wall didn't I. In fact it breaks the fourth wall quite homourously. If you've stayed with this review to now congratulations... (I wouldn't have). but ywil then be the type to be enraptured by this exersiseexercise in weirdness called Foloy CoolyCooly. Go for it.",1497830400,,1428,5.072340425531915

4332770,5,B004DMIIPA,Anime classic!,1497052800,,14,6.5
4332771,2,B004DMIIPA,"I preordered this on a whim a few years ago when I was trying to get into anime a bit more, since I'd only seen shows Dragonball Z and Rurouni Kenshin on Toonami as a tot.  I liked that it was only six episodes; anime series tend to overstay their welcome and devolve into bloated, pulpy, fanservice-ridden, soap-opera-level trainwrecks that don't seem to mind if you never rewatch them. So it made sense to start small. Actually, I did read up a little on this show before buying; it was a favorite of [adult swim] staff head Mike Lazzo, and the creators of Avatar: The Last Airbender ordered the animators to view every episode prior to beginning production.  I love that show, so I was totally sold on Furri Kitty.  And to be honest, I enjoyed it the first time; since I wasn't overly familiar with Japanese animation, the distinctive art style was very pleasing.  But the novelty wore off pretty soon.
  This series centers around a kid with the pet name Tak-Un, meaning ""the pubescent bag of pus"". He's whiny, which seems to be a common theme with main characters in anime, if Evangelion is any indication.  He hangs out with some girl who overflows periodically and smokes cigarettes with angsty nonsense written on them, alias ""Mamimi"" (sp?).  They meet the wild and wacky Haruko, the pink-haired scooter-driving bassist of My Chemical Romance.  So these two females embody the sexual cravings of this poor young boy and Haruko in particular likes to tease his tally-twacker by moving in with his family and dry-humping his father.  Also there's an FBI agent tracking them down because he is convinced Haruko is harboring disease in a briefcase that could force mankind underground and return the world to the beasts.
  The show seeks to overwhelm you.  The boy Take-poon has a horniness to shake the galaxy, giving birth to all sorts of strange hallucinations like robotic hands sprouting from his head and Addams Family mimes the size of skyscrapers and Gundam angels and other bizarre creations meant to represent this kid's puberty.  It would seem that winning over viewers of anime takes minimal effort; simply insert as much spastic, random, and overwhelming imagery as possible given a vague symbolic vehicle and stir it into a mash. For bonus points, shamelessly shoehorn in references to Western pop culture without regard for context or cleverness because that's not what it's about, is it?  Because Elvis existed, and South Park is a thing.  Don't worry about tying it into your show convincingly, as South Park did by making anime the entire focus of an episode and therefore justifying the referencing by creating satire. No, aggressive digression and hyper randomness is the name of the game.  This show is essentially the Japanese version of that out-of-place anime sequence in Horton Hears a Who: pointless and cringeworthy. Samurai Champloo used hip hop as a stylistic choice and stuck with it: FLCL would integrate it as effectively as that rapping dog in the animated Titanic movie.  Symbolism is not an excuse for lack of design or lack of caring, you know it to be true. Any poignancy in this coming-of-age story is completely obscured by an opaque cloud of obnoxious distraction.  It's all look-at-me attention-seeking animation that sells itself as ""creative"". As someone who loves and wants to work in animation, this type of stuff bothers me to no end.  If you like the show, cool, but I have far too many problems with it.",1496016000,,3455,4.863481228668942

There are 6 episodes which have both dubs n' subs which both sound great. the show's soundtrack from Japanese alternative rock band ""The Pillows"" is really good. there are some great extras such as a few AMVs with songs in the show and some retakes from the dub (which are hilarious)",1456272000,,626,4.139344262295082

FLCL is highly expressive, very free associating, highly metaphorical, and does not always (or often) behave itself. This is the kind of anime where it feels like anything can happen (and there are no disappointments). The animation itself has a feeling of aliveness, one can feel the motion, like old time, hand-drawn Looney Toons or Disney. The humor is wacky, zany, slapstick; it is also a bit edgy, but not too bad.

It's only 6 episodes long, and it feels complete, but you yearn for more of this thrill ride. I absolutely love this anime. Originally this anime could only be found in three separate DVD cases at $20 each, and I couldn't justify that price tag for 6 episodes. It's well deserved, but stilll.

Over all the bluray is pretty good. The case itself is probably what bugged me the most. When you close it only the top half snaps in and the bottom half is loose. Which isn't that noticeable with the cardboard cover over top of it. Sadly though, my copy of the cover has small creases on it. You won't see unless you look at it in the light, but still. I'm assuming that the bluray wasn't made like that, and that the problem was caused by shipping. Over all its only the little things that make this product less than perfect. If you plan on buying the series (which you really should do if you're going to watch it.) I would without a doubt recommend you buy this version. The problems are most likely only on my copy and I feel that watching this series in HD is the only proper way to watch it.",1428969600,2,912,4.181818181818182

4332913,1,B004DMIIPA,"I understand that I am in the minority, but I cannot get past how much I disliked this show. I appreciate how it tries to be quirky, weird, and seemingly aimless, but I think Quack Experimental Anime Excel Saga did that far better. I had difficulty deciding whether or not I liked Fooly Cooly at first, but then I realized that I had no interest in seeing it again. The only redeeming qualities about this show are its animation, which perfectly compliments its wackiness, Amarao, whose eyebrows make him look like Mandy Patinkin, and Haruko. Haruko is just so insane that you find it hard not to place all your attention on her. Even so, I found every single one of the characters to be forgettable, stupid, or just downright spiteful. The flaws of some of our main characters seem so forced that I find them hard to sit through because we have no balance. I was promised humor; zaniness and ridiculousness eventually loses its humorous effect. The other source of humor WOULD be the anime satire, but the world is already so out of whack that the situations seem commonplace and the possible humor is sapped instantaneously. It takes a clever mind to pull off such a feat, but such praise is lost with the humor. The music is nonexistent in my memory, even though many praise the Japanese rock approach. They aren't really in my taste, so you can judge for yourself. The plot is up to the viewer, as there are several different interpretations (the most common being Naota's coming-of-age). I personally think that the directors threw in several different plot points to lead people down different paths, having no specific plot in mind themselves. Even so, it was so overblown and I was so uninvested in the characters that I ended up rather bored; six episodes seemed like 13. It was creative, most definitely, but I found it an utter waste of my time. I came out having experienced no deep-thinking, no powerful emotions, and no enjoyment. I am further confused about all of the praise FLCL receives; while special in its own right, I see it as a failed experiment. Apparently, though, it did not fail. Blame its mind-blowing wackiness or the fact that people like things that receive popular reviews by the majority, FLCL is liked the world over against all odds. I recommend FLCL for the most hardcore anime fan who desires to have credibility as an otaku, but don't expect anything other than a unique experience; take my word as you see fit.",1421280000,4,2450,4.68677494199536

The animation is really nice & different. The story is fun & confusing a bit, but the fun part of it takes away the confusion XD
Overal it's a fun watch.. Not something for kids tho, since it includes Violence/Sexual Contents.
The packing is really nice n the graphic is really cool on it. Everything is in one DVD so it does not take a lot of DVD shelf space, since it's not a Box Set.
If you are an anime fan n haven't seen Fooly Cooly ''FLCL''.. Give it a try. It's got comedy, action, romance/love & it's very sic-fi n imaginary. You'll dig it ; ]

4332940,5,B004DMIIPA,"This is a wonderful animate adventure. It's anime, hentai, and even has a slight bit of manga, telling the story of a young boy's anxiety, angst, and loneliness while dealing with an alien and battling intergalactic forces--sort of. And there's a fantastic, bitchin' power pop soundtrack.",1412985600,,288,5.282608695652174

Weird, wacky, silly, zany, and many more strange adjectives describe this. Nothing I would recommend due to its bizarre style, but if you have seen it, and want an excuse to play it on blu ray. Pick it up, and change your TV settings so it will switch to widescreen.",1411084800,,420,4.2625

4332976,5,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL is something that can hardly be explained. It defies the conventions of anime while at the same time confirming every last one. It's confusing, it's a mishmash of everything from classic slice of life to manga to South Park. It does what it wants, how it wants, when it wants so that it can tell the story of one kid growing up. It's confusing, but so is life. And what do you do with life? You deal with it. At a certain point with FLCL, you don't try and see how everything is completely cohesive. It doesn't all fit together, and that's not a bad thing. We're learning the lessons about life and growing up along with Natoa, and that's where the first episode ends.

Ok, not exactly like that. There's some explanation to my view of the series at large there, but there's quite a bit to it that really can't be put down into words. It really is something that needs to be seen and for you to make your own decision on what it all means. I've not heard two people who come up with the same reading of this series, and that makes it kind of wonderful. You're always finding something new, and that means the series never truly gets old. It helps that the animation is truly stunning, and the voice casts (both Japanese and American) are wonderful. This series, from Gainax, seems to be them trying to go in a different direction. This series is very much their Anti-Evagelion series, while still not letting go of some of the inpenetrability that seemed to coat NGE. Of course, it makes sense that this is different once you realize that the team that put FLCL together is the team that split off from Gainax to create Studio Trigger, which did not just create series like Gurren Lagann, but also the recent Kill La Kill. This is a group that makes incredible work, and absolutely deserves your time.

Now that I've made the case for the series, what of the Blu-Ray? This, being one of the first series I've picked up on the Blu Ray format itself, turned out beautiful. The colors are amazing, the art is crisp, and the animation is so insanely smooth it almost feels like a different city. The stereo tracks sound amazing, and the inclusion of both voice casts is thankfully there.

The extras they included are pretty fun, but they aren't the main focus of the set. What you're looking for in this is the up-rezed image and audio, and in one disk instead of three or four (depending on which set you originally picked them up in). With that, you get everything you've asked for and wanted in this Blu-Ray. This is an absolute must buy for and anime viewer that's been with the style for a long time. The newer anime viewer may be completely lost if they come in with this as their first series, though.",1410134400,,2710,4.426853707414829
4332977,5,B004DMIIPA,"Easily one of the best series ever created.  The true ""meaning"", lessons, or morals presented in the series are all expressed metaphorically leaving the viewer to determine their own subjective meaning.  Despite this the metaphors are so emotionally resonant that any objective truth derived from the metaphors is intuitively understood.  To put it simply, even two people who think this show means two completely different things will still agree on its value as a work of art.  A glance into a world much like our own but at the same time fantastically different in an alternative, weird, and amazing way.  Nothing amazing happens here, everything is ordinary.",1409184000,,662,5.149532710280374
4332978,5,B004DMIIPA,"What can I say, it is VERY engaging, inventive, and extremely entertaining (1996?) series, and this from a 65 year old guy.  I go back to it alot.  Blu-ray IS an improvement over the DVD, but only marginally (I bought both for venues where I have no access to a BR player). Provoked me to get the OST CDs by The Pillows.

It takes some getting used to because it is way out there wild, but after a few watches, (and you will watch it more than once!) it gets better and better. The main character is awesome. Alien chick with cool bass guitar and an awesome in control attitude. You should get to know her. The backing characters are super too. Boy who doesn't know what the heck is going on, 12 yr old cigarette smoking girl, and hipster dad who loves the ladies. Lots of action, and weirdness, and reference jokes about real pop culture. I really love this series. Wish it was longer, or they would make a sequel, but the whole story is here. LOVE IT! And I am not a die hard anime watcher.

4332996,5,B004DMIIPA,"Fooly Cooly remains among the best anime stories ever told.  FLCL accomplishes in 6 episodes what most series fail to accomplish in dozens or even hundreds of episodes: a complete story that knows what it wants to say and when to stop saying it.  Top-notch voice acting, ingenious visuals and animation, memorable scenes, quotes, and characters, all viewed through the filter of demoralizing, yet comedic coming-of-age angst.",1404691200,,425,5.3283582089552235

The combination of great writing, hilarious pop culture parodies, stunning visuals, a killer soundtrack and additional content practically makes this item sell itself!

If you're new to Anime, or a die hard Anime fan or anywhere in between, this is a must have for your collection. FLCL is a hilariously chaotic and utterly fantastic Anime that deserves its place in the hall of greats. I cannot say enough good things about this six episode series. If you enjoy Evangelion or Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, you'll fall in love with this spastic little treasure we like to call: Fooly Cooly. Honestly if you haven't seen this Anime yet, you should purchase this right away. If you have seen it before, it's worth the extra cash to own it on Blu-Ray without a doubt.

episodes 1 and 2 i am nostalgic, glad to be watching it again, by episodes 3 and 4 i'm wondering why i love this short series so much, and by the end of episode 6 it all comes back to me and i'm glad to have the experience of watching it again.

is it for everybody? no. i've watched the series a dozen times and i can attest, it's way out there. but if you are new and stick with it, it  WILL be a good experience. the amazing soundtrack, stellar animation, and original story make for a great time. it's less entertainment, and more of an experience.

all these elements, on blu ray, in addition to inclusions such as the original Ride on Shooting Star music video by the Pillows makes this a must buy for anyone remotely interested in the set. see it. be happy.",1393718400,3,908,4.236994219653179

Always remembered how good it was and never thought could get my hands on it but now own it. I am incredibly happy to have it in my anime DVD collection. It is a very fun albeit weird series.

There is not much to the packaging. It has inside artwork. It has just one disk with a colorful pattern connected to the series. The on-disc extras are many though. Director and voice actor commentaries. It also has music videos connected to The Pillows the band that did pretty much all the music in FLCL. It includes clean opening and closing animation-the theme songs. The series has sub and dub.

This version I watched through dubbed, and I think it was very enjoyable both ways. The content of the show is really strange and offbeat, but hilarious and action packed. I almost feel like Scott Pilgrim must have taken some cues from it.

The bonus features are gold too, I loved the Pillows music video. The only complaint I have about this disc is that every time I put it in my DVD player, it forced me to watch a two minute commercial for Neon Genesis Evangelion, which was unskippable.",1390435200,,611,4.359649122807017

But do you really want to analyze a show that features an alien woman flirting with a little boy after screwing his dad and a robot version of his dad? I didn't think so.

An epic love story amongst space pirates, interdimensional-intercranial portals, robot maids and baseball. It's a shame this series didn't run longer because in just a few short episodes the characters are completely fleshed out and have their own needs and backstories.

4333082,5,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL is an anime series without form or focus.  It is the animated ramblings of a madman.  It doesn't go weird for the sake of being weird, it isn't style over substance.  It's mental.  That would be a good way to describe the show: it goes mental.  Not ""it goes mental for the sake of being mental"" but just ""it goes mental"" because FLCL does not at any point offer a qualifier for what it does.  That is its strength: that it never feels the need to justify itself and never becomes self aware.

  The series is about an apathetic sixth grader, Naota, who while fooling around with his brother's girlfriend is run over by a Vespa driving by a pink-haired crazy woman, Haruko, who has nothing with her except a chainsaw shotgun bass guitar.  Thus opening the flood gates to a plot of alien conspiracy, giant robots, sports philosophy, and sexual misconduct.  The flood gates being Haruko herself as she creates impossible situations through the simplest of means.  The plot itself, caused by Haruko, never really starts and never really stops.  It just kind of happens.  And it happens loud and fast.

  Haruko, being the instigator of all the major events, is where FLCL teeters on the edge of being completely fascinating and completely unwatchable.  At a flick of the wrist, and often times faster than that, she will completely change her attitude, disposition, and even personality.  This means that the main driving force behind the story is totally undefined.  In fact, all of the characters exist in an undefined state.  All of them can be described but not in any human sounding way.  The only one who is somewhat relatable and definable is Naota but even then he is so emotionally detached that it almost doesn't even matter.

The animation style of FLCL is just about as indefinable as its plot and characters.  It's always bouncing around and changing from one to another.  Going from 3-D animation to a manga style and even to the animation style of South Park with an almost gleeful zeal.  It looks how it feels it should look and sometimes looks how it feels it shouldn't look.  All of the styles work in some way and as a result FLCL is one of the most visually interesting anime series I've ever come across.

  Despite being a ""series without form or focus"", constantly changing animation styles, and having undefined characters it never feels like it is rattling keys in your face.  That's thanks in no small part to its short runtime of six episodes.  Any longer and it would have been near insufferable after a while.  There are also enough slow quite moments to keep momentum going without it being exhausting to watch.  In fact it is one of the most fun series to watch despite being objectively awful in terms of writing.  But that right there could be what makes it great.  Yes, great, despite how it sounded like I was ragging on it most of the review.

  Does it mean anything?  I have a few theories but how much does it really matter?  I don't know.  Then again what do I know?  Not much.  All I know is FLCL is a great show.",1381017600,,3055,4.567467652495379

There are so many references to other anime in this series that it's always fun to re-watch and try to catch those references. The slipcase had a wrinkle or two, but it obviously doesn't effect my rating since the anime itself is flawless. I've noticed that if you buy a couple of items and have them shipped together that the slipcase usually has no damage. I'm not sure if this has to do with the box sizes or if it is just my imagination. But I would wait to get this and other anime like this until you are going to grab a couple of things that will ship together (of course I'm sure the items that will ship with it will effect the condition it will be when you get it too).

4333107,4,B004DMIIPA,"While Fooly Cooly (Furi Kuri) isn't the best anime since Sliced Bread: The Animated Series, it is nonetheless a crazy and entertaining series with badass music and some pretty ridiculous (in a good way) characters. If the seriousness of some anime has got you down, then this is the show for you, since it doesn't take itself too seriously. The best thing about this OVA series in my opinion is its length. When you add all of the episodes together, the total time it takes to watch the series in full is somewhere around the length of 3 90 minute movies. Essentially, instead of having a movie marathon, you can have a FOOLY COOLY marathon and be able to finish the series in one sitting! The great thing that comes from this is that you are able to experience the series in full without losing track of the pl- wait, you'll probably lose track of the plotline regardless, as it's pretty nonsensical and random most of the time. The shortness of the series does contribute well to its replayability however!

Overall, I'd definitely recommend fans of anime to check this one out, unless of course randomness is not your cup of tea, as that is what Fooly Cooly thrives on.",1363478400,,1172,4.580952380952381

4333143,3,B004DMIIPA,"Fooly Cooly might be one the of the most unique animes of all time. It goes crazy with it's content with a lot of intresting humor and sometimes a whole bunch of crazy action scenes. It's pretty short as well but ever so satisfying. When the anime was released back in 2000 it pretty much set a standard as the animation quality was getting better and better. As well as showing that creativity can be used in many different animes. Now when I got my hands on the Blu Ray version of Fooly Cooly I was happy but also a little bit dissapointed. Now the anime for some reason hasn't been upscaled to 16:9. Granted the animation quality has been smoothed out and things do look better. However FLCL came out in 2000, As it is quite old but I think an upscaling in the visuals should have been added in for good use. It would have made the overall Blu Ray copy more worth it. Also their is also a lack of extras for some odd reason which kinda defeats the purpose of something that could have been added. Also I would reccomend to get Fooly Cooly at a lower price. Even though the Six Episodes are prety funny and entertaining, I would not reccomend paying more then $20 for it. It's better off to buy FLCL 2nd Hand for much cheaper used or if you want you can always just rent it. But overall heres a short saying. Fooly Cooly is still pretty funny and it did do quite a bit for Animes. However this Blu Ray edition would have gotten even higher raiting if the quality was at 16:9. Then the purchase would have a totaly been worth it. Otherwise buy or rent with a honest look but you should be able to get into this short but sweet series.",1353196800,,1635,4.226837060702875
4333154,4,B004DMIIPA,"Many reviewers have already discussed the show, so I won't say much about the episodes.  I do highly recommend watching this anime and buying it if you like it.  It definitely isn't for everyone.  I watch many types of anime, and I am not sure how I'd compare this to my other favorites.  The show and the music are a shock to the system...an explosion...in a good way, of course.  It is short and powerful.

I recommend the director commentaries to fans who want some insights into some of the FLCL experience.  However, the commentaries can be slow and boring compared to others I've seen.  The music is great, and I recommend giving the soundtracks a try. The menu system is good but not exceptional. There is no artwork in the menu system, but you get some nice images watching the music videos.  The subtitles are white text outlined in black. I feel like I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse in other shows.

In case it isn't clear elsewhere, here are the extras included with the Blu-ray:
*Director Commentaries (Subtitled only from what I could tell)
*Videos with Music by The Pillows
*""Ride on Shooting Star"" Video by The Pillows
*Outtakes
*Textless Closing Song
*Trailers

Audio Special Feature: Dolby TrueHD Japanese 2.0
Subtitles English for both Main and Special Features
The information under Editorial Reviews - Product Description is taken straight off the back cover of the product.

I knocked half a star off due to the lack of included material.  I was really hoping for a booklet or at least more artwork. The customer submitted pictures #1 - 7 really are all you get.  A paper cover, a basic Blu-ray case, a sleeve with information and pictures front and back, the disc, and a FUNimation reply card.  I knocked another half a star off for not having 5.1 audio.

There are some customer submitted pictures (#10 - 12 at this time) that indicate the Blu-ray version has many visual quality issues.  That seems to be typical of older shows that were probably not created with Blu-ray quality in mind being transferred to Blu-ray years later.  I have watched the episodes on this disk, and I was not distracted by any quality issues in the video or audio.  I'm an anime fan, but I am not a video or audio expert.

Note that the cover says it is rated TV14.  However, as with all anime, I recommend you watch the entire show with English audio and subtitles before letting your children watch it.  There is some very heavy sexual situations in my conservative opinion.  Just what is Furi Kuri anyhow?

Feel free to comment and ask any questions you might have.

Amazon lists the Blu-Ray as widescreen, it is not widescreen. I looked over the menu trying to see if there was an option to change it but there wasn't one. Although the Pillows video is in widescreen, odd.

  What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? This series is awesome and was done really well. Part of what makes it great is that if your like me and hate having to take the time to read into things, then the surface that this series provides and entertaining story that is simple to understand. If you do like to read into things then this movie provides that too and blends the two together perfectly. It also add to the value of watching it over and over because each time you watch it, you'll see something different. The voice actors are amazing and watching this series in English is more fun than watching it in Japanese as they do well to ""bring it home"" for us.",1329091200,,703,4.318181818181818

4333169,5,B004DMIIPA,"Although it's hard to do this series justice in a written review I'll try.

 It's almost like the producers said ""lets take something mundane like dealing with growing up, and then tell the story in the most outrageous, insane, action packed way that we possibly can"".

This is a story of a teenage boy, Naota, living in a small seemingly boring town filled with some unique characters. His older brother has moved to the U.S. leaving behind his girlfriend who seems to use Naota as a replacement, out of nowhere a girl on a scooter runs him over in a comical way then proceeds to revive him, and then bash him in the head with a bass guitar, only to later move into his families house as their house keeper, from there the girl continues to toy with the young man. But somethings not right about the area where she hit him in the head and strange things try to pop out. This sets up the rest of the series as they wind up fighting the things coming out from this boys head, as well as a few other things, all while dealing with the usual problems of trying to grow up in a small town. Oh did I mention the girl on the scooter is an alien?
 The storyline behind all the crazy alien, giant robot fighting is surprisingly deep and well told, and the music they chose is probably one of the most fitting soundtracks I've ever heard for an anime... the music is pure genius.

Even though it is only six episodes you will find yourself watching over and over again.",1326067200,,1460,4.313868613138686
4333170,5,B004DMIIPA,"I remember seeing this series years ago on Adult Swim and simply falling in love with it.  The show is beautiful, heartbreaking, energetic, and truly touching.  It affected me in a way that very few TV shows have, period, much less cartoons!  Six episodes was perfect for the story, but far too few for a true fan of the show.  If you get it, you won't regret it.  The packaging itself is colorful and great to look at, as well.

As for the actual product, it arrived speedily and in perfect shape.  The package was brand-new, so it was in out-of-the-box condition and played just fine.  All-around good.

4333172,4,B004DMIIPA,"It was late night in the summer of 2003. Adult Swim was the start of it and one of the shows they aired was something that made me laugh so hard. There are only a few shows out there that truly made me laugh so much that I knew that show will be my favorite, maybe even forever. FLCL is one of those shows. When I learned there were DVDs out for U.S., I wanted to get them but then later found out that the price was too high and didn't want to get them with such a price. The fact that there were only 6 episodes in this anime series, I didn't think I should get it. Then a few years gone by and the dvds were becoming rare and the price got higher and higher when I thought it would become cheap in the future. I was totally wrong. The year is 2011 and still watch Adult Swim. Suddenly, I saw a commercial about FLCL and I thought it was just another advertising that Adult Swim would air the show again but it wasn't. It was a commercial telling me that FLCL is going to be on blu-ray and on DVD. I couldn't believe it and the feeling of interest of buying FLCL, once again came back to me. This time, I know that I need to get it this time for sure. Not knowing the aspect ratio of the blu-ray version, I didn't care much at all. All I know is that I finally have myself a copy of FLCL because it's one of the classic anime series that I truly like and was one of the anime series that has been in my list of must-have animes for a long time. First anime blu-ray to own as well. I'm happy about finally owning this anime and finally it's on blu-ray as well.",1324252800,3,1561,3.9430379746835444
4333173,3,B004DMIIPA,"Well, FLCL is without question one of the best anime series ever made. A work of pure genius. This Blu-ray collection leaves me extremely unsatisfied. I expected some extras beyond some ""not at all funny"" bloopers of the voice actors messing up lines. I also expected a full up-scaled HD 720 or 1080 video...hell even a widescreen! But you don't get any of that, you get the traditional boxed ""not HD aspect ratio. It is very upsetting. 6 episodes with no real change from the DVD quality, yet with no extras and no up scaled video for over $20? Thats really an immense rip off but I would pay $50+ for the series on VHS if I had to, the series itself is worth every penny and then some.

I am not at all happy with the picture quality. The series was not remastered so do not expect some awesome quality, you will get typical un-remastered DVD quality on a Blu-ray disk. These are the only reasons I am forced to give this buy a 3/5. As for the series itself, it is a solid 5/5 and beyond. Without question, one of the best works ever produced. So whacky and out there that you can't help but to sit back, ask questions, laugh and feel some sense of longing for that type of an adventure.

4333196,5,B004DMIIPA,"This is a totally over the top coming of age story for adults who do not need immediate or final resolutions to plots or subtexts.

No ""happily ever after"" here.",1318118400,,343,4.5

4333198,5,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL is probably one of the strangest series you will have watched. Ever. Though as confusing as its plot can be at times, it never gets ridiculously convoluted, knowing just the right limit to push its viewers to make them think ""yeah, I don't get it, but if I watch it enough times, I probably will."" And considering that it's only five episodes long, you very well can (and should!) do such.

For the uninitiated, FLCL pretty much defined an era of anime fans that would have otherwise been completely dominated by the likes of Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. And unlike studio Gainax's other hit at the time (Evangelion), it doesn't take itself too seriously (or seriously at all, for that matter); while Evangelion told the coming of age story in the most pretentious way possible, FLCL takes things in the completely opposite direction, telling the same story in the most ridiculous zany way possible. You may not get everything at first, but with a few more watches, you'll start to notice little bits and pieces that tie together each episode. And even if you don't, that's what the episode commentaries for each episode are for.

Besides the commentary tracks, there are also music tracks from The Pillows, whose Japanese Rock tunes permeate the entire series along with the music video for the series closing credits theme - ""Ride On Shooting Star."" One minor complaint is that the music video seems to be in widescreen, but doesn't adjust for widescreen televisions, making the footage surrounded by black bars on all sides. Other than that, though, the extras alone make up for paying around $20 for a 5-episode series.

As for those wondering about picking up the Blu-Ray versus sticking to the DVD version: The series was made in 2000, so I wouldn't consider the footage nice enough to warrant paying the extra for the BR version. However, other reviewers have stated that the BR footage in this release is different from the apparently horrendous BR footage used in the original Japanese BR release, so there's always that to consider. At the end of the day, though, I'd say stick to the DVD version; the animation is nice... but it isn't *that* nice.",1316217600,,2163,4.793565683646112
4333199,5,B004DMIIPA,"I must have watched FLCL at least five or six times before I ventured out and bought it. I had only watched the subd version online, so when i saw that the English dub version was uncensored, I was VERY pleased. Personally, i am against any and all censorship. And when I didn't even have to select anything to see the original uncut content, that made me glad that i had bought this.

The physical contents of the case include a cardboard slide cover, the blu-ray case, the single disk, and on the inside is some creative artwork that shows through the transparent blue case. I am always one to get the artwork, physical or digital.

When you play this compared to the other original cuts, dvd, online etc, the colors are great. There is no glitching of any type, and all of the frames are very smooth.

All in all this is money very well spent, unless you don't like anime, but then why would you be here?",1316131200,,907,4.355029585798817

The quality seems good, but I had a hard time reading the subtitles, mostly during the section of episode one where it is manga. It could have been my distance from the television. about 12' from a 32"" tv. Other than that I have no complaints.",1314576000,,333,4.475409836065574

My friend showed me the series when I was a freshman in high school, and since then, it's been an-at-least-annual watch for me. Normally it's about three times. And that's always been either watch it online with terrible quality, borrow the bootleg DVDs my friend had, or catch it on [adult swim] with commercials. Funimation finally has done something right (well, with Amazon's help... that 40$ MSRP is ridiculous) in releasing this incredible OVA series on ONE disc (that's right, Synch-Point. ONE disc. 6 episodes don't need more than one.) Everything about this series is amazing, from the hilarious art, to the great voice acting on both sides, to the even better soundtrack by the pillows. If there's anyone on the fence about buying this DVD, or even watching the series in general, my advice obviously is YES, GOD YES, DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND WATCH FLCL.

4333215,4,B004DMIIPA,"First of all, if you've never seen FLCL before, and you like anime that is strange and exciting, that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a lot of fun because of it, stop reading this and just buy it! I promise you will not regret your purchase!

Now, as far as the review, what else can be said about FLCL itself except that it's a fantastic 6-episode OVA series that catches your eye with stunning visuals, now improved thanks to HD resolution, catches your heart with the character interactions and real emotions expressed, and captures your imagination with an outrageous story that could only be realized in an animated feature. It's got people getting smashed in the head with guitars that also happen to fire bullets and grenades like a rifle, it's got giant robots that somehow warp in by way of a portal in the head of a young boy, it's got crazy good music, and it's even got a yellow Vespa! And that's just skimming the surface! So, again, if you have never seen FLCL, just buy the darn thing, already!

As for this release, well, it has similar problems to the original DVD releases. The subtitles are white with a very thin outline, which makes them hard to read in some scenes, especially the ""manga style"" scenes in two of the episodes, where the subtitles are nearly impossible to read. They could have been a bit more careful and changed the subtitle color for that scene, which involves a lot of black moving lines on a white background, but they just left them the same white text with a thin outline, thus very hard to read with all that black and white movement going on behind them.  Other than that, the translation is also unchanged from the DVD release, mistakes and bad grammar and all. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly watchable, and readable, and definitely gets the job done, but in the end I think I expected a little more effort with this new release. That's why I give it 4 stars. It sadly loses a star for the lazy factor when it comes to the subtitles and translation/editing.

Overall, this is the best version of FLCL you can buy, probably even including in Japan, since this includes the English dub and has subtitles. I highly recommend this item.",1313798400,2,2193,4.558375634517766

4333219,5,B004DMIIPA,"How does one review FLCL, accurately describe its plot and appeal, and not sound ludicrously insane?  When I first asked my spouse what FLCL was ""about,"" she said, ""It's about a kid who has a robot come out of his head.""  WHAT??  My point exactly.  It's like trying to describe Midori Days: ""It's about a guy whose hand turns into a cute girl from the waist up.""  It really makes no sense; if anything, it makes your friends think you are some kind of weirdo or pervert.

So--FLCL.  In defense of the love of my life, FLCL isn't really about a robot busting out of a kid's head.  That description comes close to capturing the main plot device in a short sentence, but FLCL is really a coming-of-age story about the magic of first love.  Every one of us remembers our first crush--maybe it was on someone in our year, or perhaps someone older.  For those of us in the latter category, maybe it was a brother or sister's best friend, or the scruffy senior who sat in the back of our 11th grade algebra class.  Maybe it was the cute doctor or lawyer from career day.  Whatever.  There is a certain amount of awkwardness, shyness, and (in retrospect) hilarity that accompanies those years, and FLCL nails this.  Is FLCL about nostalgia?  Is it about looking back at our childhood through a colored lens (or rather, through a kaleidoscope) and seeing what we want to see?  Is it about trying to understand what it means to realize you really aren't a kid anymore but you still aren't old enough to drive and make real decisions?  I think so.

For all of its intelligence--and I stand by that statement: FLCL is a smart anime--FLCL might have tanked without Haruko.  In a series that aims to give us fresh, uncliched characters, Haruko is a total cipher.  To write her off as a magical girlfriend does not do her justice; we almost never know what she's really thinking, what she really feels, or what her agenda really is.  It's this mix of uncertainty, zaniness, and alien impenetrability that brings me back to FLCL over and over again.

I've unfortunately seen FLCL undermined and abused by viewers who either did not appreciate its humor or did not understand its story, which is a real shame, because both are excellent.  FLCL is frenetic and fast-paced, and requires more than one viewing to fully comprehend.  Contrary to popular dismissals, there is a story here; I still watch it today and notice things I missed before, and the comedy is always as fresh as the first viewing.

If you are viewing FLCL for the first time, don't be concerned about not understanding the first two or three episodes.  You will receive a helpful bit of exposition later, which will put the previous episodes in context and contribute to a great second viewing.  Instead, try to enjoy FLCL for what it is: a sweet, coming-of-age comedy with robots.",1310860800,,2831,4.61
4333220,2,B004DMIIPA,"I watched FLCL when it used to play on cable in early 00s. I thought that now, many years later, my opinion of this show would change but it did not. The plot very much resembles the plot of the classic anime series Obnoxious Aliens which played throughout the 80s. Basically shy or awkward males interact with weird or clueless girl from some far away land, in this case space. While the show may have some interesting moments like the little robot that eats electronics, the show on the whole is bordering on annoying. Just like some other animes here you will see same recurring characters copied and pasted from other shows. Same expressions and demeanor.

Overall FLCL's plot content makes it seem as if the show was planned to last way more than six episodes and was probably canceled. It is not difficult to see why that could be so. It is not fun and irritating. Especially the main pink haired character, whose character goes overboard with its expressions of free spirit and spontaneity.

Keep in mind, if you're a parent purchasing this for young children or for young teens you should be aware FLCL contains some risque content like images of semi nude females, violence, and suggestive content.",1310774400,6,1207,4.742857142857143
4333221,3,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL finally got released again, and has a Blu Ray version! But before you buy the BD version, you might want to read my review and reconsider. As the story of FLCL is explained in other reviews I'll cover more technical stuff and give my short opinion. So lets get started with the pros and cons of this famous anime.

Pros:

- High quality animation. Way before it's time in every way.

- Great music and amazing voice acting (for the Japanese dub).

- Tons of extras included on the BD. This BD includes all the commentary episodes (6 in total),
  English dub bloopers, clear opening and ending, and the music video from the original DVDs.

- Comes with a nice (but too colorful) sleeve to protect the Blu Ray box.

Cons:

- No anti-aliasing! Yes, you are reading right. Despite the DVD having anti-aliasing, the BD doesn't. This means that
  instead of looking crisp and sharp (like most real Full HD anime look) this remastered FLCL have jagged lines which pop
  out and ALWAYS suck your attention from the series. This is horrible. Why does my old DVD version of FLCL look better than
  the new BD one?!? This is the reason I took two stars away from the rating of FLCL.

- No widescreen support. The BD ratio is 4X3, and since this is a blu ray disc, you cannot upscale it using your player. This
  is annoying for two reasons. First, I know the original FLCL was SD 4x3 ratio, but when I originally watched it a couple
  of years ago on my DVD I could upscale it to widescreen and it looked pretty nice. Second,the English bloopers on the BD
  are actually taken directly from the DVD without being remastered; They are presented in widescreen and look really good
  on my HDTV regardless of being SD. But since this is a BD and Funimation didn't think of remastering this as a widescreen
  version if you buy the BD you are stuck with the 4x3 ration conversion.

- Horrible English dub. But you will not watch it, because the Japanese dub is superb.

- It's been about seven years since I've seen FLCL and it still is wonderful, but not for every one. Beware, if you are not
  the most epic of anime fans AND already know the Japanese language you will miss about half of the jokes in this series
  (did you get the play-of-words joke they made in episodes 1 using the words earlobe, mamimi and mimitabu?).

Conclusion:

FLCL is a great anime and you should buy it. But you shouldn't buy this Blu Ray version. It has no anti-aliasing and doesn't support widescreen upscaling. It's hard to say this, buy you should definitely buy FLCL...on DVD.

The equipment I used to play this BD:
- FLCL BD (Funimation 2011 remastered version). I did not buy it from Amazon, but another retailer.
- PS3 with HDMI cable for 1080p viewing.
- Samsung SSO2 Full HD TV.",1310342400,,2759,4.439121756487026

4333244,4,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL was released in Japan in early 2000, one of the first animated series to be done entirely on computers, rather than through the use of traditional inks and paints on animation cels. Today, most shows are animated digitally, and have come a long way from their iconic, groundbreaking Japanese predecessor. While gorgeous in its own right, with flawlessly fluid animation during its action sequences, and still of better quality than a lot of series produced even today, FLCL's age does show in places. While not immediately noticeable, one can see the digital process that went into it, pixels and the like appearing when the camera zooms in on one particular frame. Even when broadcast over a standard television screen these can be caught, and Blu-ray does nothing to change or enhance this. The picture quality is sharper, but may unnecessarily blur and blend when you wouldn't expect for it to. It wouldn't be a bad idea to purchase the DVD version of this series instead. However, considering the Blu-ray release is so well-priced and perfectly affordable, it gets some good points. Not five stars, since the high-definition doesn't affect the show's quality; but four stars, because the price is right, and the show is perfectly watchable in either form.

If you want the DVD version it's only $5.00 cheaper but because of that the bluray is the way to go for this since it's not much more expensive.
Since FLCL wasn't made with HD in mind, it's not wide screen, it's 4x3. There are black bars on the side if your using a HDTV. It doesn't ruin the picture quality at all though. The picture is clean and crisp. Funimation did a pretty good job at remastering FLCL to 1080p. The sound is the big thing in this release. It supports Dolby TrueHD English/Japanese 2.0 so it sounds amazing.

There's some extras stuffed in there too. The normal director commentaries, outtakes, and trailers. There are The Pillows music videos thrown in here too, like 5 of them including ""Ride On Shooting Star"". These are low quality because they weren't film in HD obviously. I watched the trailers too. The resolution for some are 1080p. Some are 720p and 480i. The Summer War trailer was the best one out of all the trailers and it makes me want it badly.

I have nothing bad to say about this series. It may be short, but it is, in my opinion, the best anime series of all time.

Naota is a normal kid going to a normal school. One day when he is walking with his friend Mamimi, he gets run over by a woman on a Vespa Scooter that later bashes his head in with a bass guitar. She then decides to live with Naota and his father, Kamon, to get closer to Naota. It...doesn't go so well when a giant robot pops out of Naota's head though...kinda ruined the relationship.

I bought the Blu-Ray as a long time fan and I thought the upscaling looked great, and the bonus features were cool, including a pillows music video, and other songs, outtakes, and directors commentary. The show is definitely one of my all time favorites, and FLCL develops its characters in # hours than many long running 50 episode animes can. It is definitely worth the purchase, and I recommend buying the Blu-Ray instead of the DVDs, because if not for the picture quality, for the convenience of having everything on one disc, instead of three for the DVD set.

How many shows have odd but incredibly detailed end credit sequences?  The directors commentary is genius because it's spoken in Japanese, but translated into subtitles so you can follow it.

4333297,5,B004DMIIPA,"Gainax and Production IG are known for producing some of the most prolific works in anime, between them such titles as ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"", ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", ""Eden of the East"" and ""Gunbuster"". Both of them are brilliant studios in their own right, but like many great things (PB&J, milk and cookies, Hall & Oates), these two extraordinary talents produce fantastic work when combined. Work that, even eleven years later, continues to influence and inspire modern anime directors, writers and studios. That work is the phenomenally messed-up acid trip that is Fooly Cooly, or FLCL.

12 year-old Naota has a comparatively normal life. He hangs out with his older brother's pyromaniac of an ex-girlfriend, carries around a baseball bat for no immediately apparent reason, and lives in a town whose most distinguishing feature is a factory shaped like a jumbo-sized laundry iron. To him, this is just boring, everyday life, and one that he's sick and tired of. Naota craves change, and shortly into the first episode, he gets it, in the form of a smack to the head by a guitar wielded by a pink-haired girl on a yellow Vespa. This is not a typical beginning to an anime hero's tale, needless to say.

And that's what makes FLCL so great: it's unconventional approach to typical storytelling conventions. After his fateful encounter with the pink-haired Vespa girl, named Haruko Haruhara, Naota begins his path to manhood. However, this path is one paved with robots bursting forth from his head, with Haruko's non-stop maniacal antics, and with Earth-saving baseball home runs. Nothing is as you expect it to be in FLCL, and quite frankly, that's why fans still adore it to this day.

In many works of a similar nature, we'd see an insecure boy growing into maturity by piloting a giant robot, while falling for a cute, demure alien woman, and excising inner demons by fighting the forces of evil. This world, though, has no defined sense of good or bad, has the furthest thing from a ""cute"" or ""demure"" woman, and features a robot that first appears as a rectangular zit on Naota's forehead. By showing us the opposite of what we expect from this show, Gainax and IG succeeded where so many studios have failed: authentically capturing a boy's movement through puberty. Every bit of FLCL's world is a personification of Naota's insecurities, shortcomings, doubts, fears, and sexual frustrations, blown up to often grotesque macros in order for the viewer to understand them. In doing this, the two studios crafted something that is altogether brilliant and groundbreaking.

But don't let that serious-sounding analysis fool you into thinking this series isn't a riotous good time as well. Gags, of both the verbal and visual variety, come flying at the viewer at almost breakneck speeds, and can confuse those who aren't keeping their eyes absolutely glued to the screen. That's not hard to do, though, when what you're watching is animation of the highest caliber, bright colors in vivid detail with fluid animation oozing from every second of this series. Many current anime series actually look rather pedestrian compared to the beautiful world presented to us here.

On the audio side of things, we have what is perhaps one of the best soundtracks recorded for ANYTHING, let alone an anime. Instead of creating an orchestral score, or a bubbly array of synth waves, the producers told J-Garage group The Pillows to get into a studio and go absolutely wild. They did just that, and created music that fits in all the right places. Distorted guitar riffs and vocals highlight intense moments, and fist-pumping alt-garage ballads punctuate big battles sequences. Never once does the music feel out of place, a rare feat for any soundtrack.

Now, I will admit I have only seen a BIT of the Japanese dub, as well as listened to the FLCL radio dramas, but both times I watched the series (first on Adult Swim way back when I was a kid, then in this edition) in English. The dub here is unchanged from Synch Point's initial dubbing, but that's not really something one can fault. Despite some necessary re-doing of Japanese language puns, the English dub matches the frantic energy of the original Japanese, and then some. From what I have seen, I would recommend watching in both languages for unique experiences, which I plan to do, but would also say that you're going to have a good time either way.

FUNImation wisely has stopped using their typical thin paper boxes with slim-pak DVD cases in recent releases, giving us instead one hard plastic container with a glossy slipcase. This is much better for aesthetic appeal on shelves, and all-in-all makes it feel like FUNI has actually started listening to customer complaints about box creasing and whatnot.

""FLCL"" is one of those rare shows that is perfect in every conceivable way. You will not walk away from this series with a single complaint, nor will you overly-scrutinize the contents within the show, simply because everything is laid bare for a viewer to take away what they want to. It is arguably more of a triumph than ""Evangelion"" (one of my personal favorites), for it doesn't bog itself down with extraneous details that ultimately serve to add a perfunctory layer of faux-depth. This show has many messages, but not so many that it feels tedious at time. Perhaps the greatest lesson one can learn from Naota and Haruko is to learn by cutting loose and having fun.

And that is possibly how ""FLCL"" is best viewed: with a laid-back and adventurous mindset.

It isn't that the storyline is particularly brilliant (it is crazy and, oddly, rather simple), but this is first class anime. Naota's whirlwind coming of age experience echoes Shinji's Freudian crisis in Evangelion without being all consuming. The action and animation shows the vividness and edginess of Gurran Lagan, but with more innovation and creativity and insanity. The soundtrack - one long rock and roll trip - fits the mood and, honestly, is just damn good music. The animation is stunning and has few comparisons. Scenes like Haruko's appearance are brilliantly entertaining and it requires a few watches just to take in all the aspects of the art. This is great anime and pushes the limits and flexing the considerable muscle of the genre.

Another interesting subtext to the series - embedded in the coming of age story - is the simple question of what it means to come of age. The adults in this film are, by and large, not very adult - scenes like Ninamori's interactions with her father's mistress and any scene involving the mess that is Naota's father bring out, strongly, the ways one can fail to come of age.

4333312,4,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL, or Fooly Cooly is standard definition digital animation. As such, you'll never see a true HD presentation for this wonderful show. This Blu-ray Disc is an upscale of the SD material.

What's the benefit then to owning this show on BD instead of DVD? Artifacts. I own the original SyncPoint DVDs. Despite only having two episodes per disc and being derived from a digital master, those DVDs are ridden with very visible and distracting macroblocking and mosquito noise. It's a matter of how old the discs are and how inefficient the MPEG-2 codec is.

This BD presentation of FLCL is not perfect. It's been sharpened a bit, so the line work stands out a bit more than I think it's supposed to. The colors are also more saturated than they were on the DVDs and I found it a bit distracting. Aliasing is present, but that's unavoidable with SD material. The aliasing is far worse on the DVDs.

Despite being an imperfect upscale of SD source material, the BD for Fooly Cooly is by far the best available presentation we have stateside thanks to the elimination of artifacts and the reduction in aliasing. And at the friendly pricing (the whole series for the same price as what a single one of the three DVDs used to cost) here on Amazon, there's no reason at all to avoid this release.

Oh, and the lossless stereo track is wonderful. Anyone who watches this show will fall in love with The Pillows.",1298937600,217,1402,4.596
4333313,5,B004DMIIPA,"This anime is a classic! It looks great, too. They throw in the Pillows music/videos as a bonus on the Blu-ray and it is definitely worth the money.",1298851200,2,148,4.321428571428571
4333314,5,B004DMIIPA,"After the existential gore-fest that was ""End of Evangelion"", Studio Gainax decided to do something a little less... traumatizing.  First they tried making the TV show ""His and Her Circumstances,"" but the author of the shojo manga on which it was based threw a hissy fit over their comedic adaptation and it was cancelled after the first season.  So they went and made FLCL, which is both a return to form for Gainax and a bold new presentation in the world of anime.

What is it about?  Well, in the typical Gainax fashion the story is not that straightforward and rather convoluted, but let's at least try to get the basics out of the way anyway.  Naota, a typical 12 year old grade-schooler, is hanging out with his older brother's horny delinquent girlfriend when a strange pink-haired woman on a Vespa scooter runs him over, gives him CPR and then whacks him upside the head with her Rickenbacker bass guitar right before moving into his house with his family.  Afterward things start getting very strange for our hero as robots start springing out of his head and he starts getting confusing feelings for Haruko, the weird, bass-wielding alien lady responsible for all of his troubles.  It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is a lot of fun.

And this anime IS a lot of fun - FLCL manages to blend surreal comedy and drama and present it at a good, quick pace.  And a warning to those of a more conventional mindset:  this anime is *weird*, with jokes and non sequiturs coming out of the blue to hit you square in the face with oddity after cartoon oddity.  This is just what a group of animators needs to make after having to grimly animate teenage girls being eaten alive by giant gruesome killer cyborgs.  FLCL is a return to Gainax making anime as a group of anime *fans,* with the patented Gainax Homage Method in full play for the first time since 1988's ""Gunbuster"":  parody an anime trope, celebrate it, then turn it up to 11.  And just like in that seminal sci-fi OVA from the previous decade, Gainax's love of animation is on full display here:  all sorts of techniques are employed to give FLCL a real kinetic quality, a sense of *life*.  Gainax's love of anime and animation in general comes through every frame, every shot of every quick gag, every classic anime reference, every fight scene, every application of a lovingly rendered vintage guitar to the head of a giant rampaging robot.  In short, FLCL is glorious.

However, what makes FLCL stand out is not only the great animation (because after all, well animated garbage is still garbage) or the great comedy - it's also the dramatic themes running through the show.  FLCL is basically about sex and growing up, and how both will screw you up.  Far too many TV shows and movies with a ""coming of age"" theme don't sit well with me as they usually seem too sentimental and not real enough.  Kazuya Tsurumaki accomplishes something amazing here:  he imbues this OVA with a wistful, nostalgic quality; at the same time he shows how much adolescence suuuuuucks.  Speaking as a male who has made it through puberty (thankfully quite a while ago) I can say that I identified with Naota while watching this: having your body do weird things and feeling an increasing confusion for the world around you is not fun.  And having weird feelings for women is not fun either (actually, it's still not fun).  Haruko is the perfect symbol of how women seem to boys Naota's age:  strange, infuriating, indecipherable, and yet strangely interesting and enticing.  At one point she examines an X-Ray of our hero and declares that his brain is missing - all the while a massive horn (hmm...) is sticking out the back of his skull.  Yeah, being a teenage boy feels like that - all hormones and no head.  Tsurumaki also doesn't give any pat endings or solutions: I won't spoil anything but I will say that Naota does not have a completely hunky dory super happy ending (although it *is* a happy ending - this is not Eva).

This new Funimation DVD of FLCL is very nice indeed.  Although it does not have all of the special features of the previous Synch-Point release, it does fit all 6 episodes onto one disc - meaning no swapping out discs after every two episodes like that previous 3 disc version.  This makes shotgunning FLCL in one sitting a little bit easier (providing of course that you can handle that much FLCL in one sitting - I can!).  Video is good:  presented in the original aspect ratio of 4:3 and free of any obvious defects.  Audio is also good, if not earthshattering with both the original Japanese and the English dub presented in 2 channel stereo.  Speaking of the English dub, the one on this disc is surprisingly good.  I normally don't watch anime in English but the dub for FLCL impressed me.  In fact, I think it can enhance one's enjoyment of this particular series as FLCL is a highly kinetic show, and reading subtitles can distract from the barrage of images on the screen.  I caught some visual details on the second viewing in English that I missed the first time in Japanese.

Special features include a director's commentary for all 6 episodes (interesting tidbit: the Vespa in the end credits is actually Tsurumaki's) which is worth listening to once.  A warning though that you have to watch the commentaries for each individual episode one at a time - there is no ""watch all"" commentary option.  Also included: English dub outtakes (nonessential), textless ending and some music videos with tunage from the show by the Pillows (the Japanese rock band that supplied the unique soundtrack), in addition to the standard trailers for other stuff by Funimation.  The only downside is that the packaging for FLCL is nothing special: a thin cardboard slipcase housing a clear standard single-disc DVD case.  The case is a bit flimsy, actually.  It seems like everyone is moving towards using the ""eco-friendly"" lighter cases nowadays and Funimation unfortunately is no exception.  If you want something sturdier to put your disc into you're going to have to replace the case.

Pluses - Very, very fun!  Great story, great animation, good music, a joyous return to form for Gainax and a chance to get their ya-yas out after the grisly Anno angst-fest that was ""Evangelion.""

Minuses - May be too weird and convoluted for some.

Conclusion - This is a classic, truly creative anime made by people who love anime and love making anime.  I recommend this highly for anyone who is a fan of Gainax, as well as anyone who likes off-the-wall anime in general.  If you like this I recommend Nobuhiko Obayashi's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House/dp/B003WKL6XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House</a>&nbsp;and the BBC sitcom&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Young-Ones/dp/B000SINSXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Young Ones</a>&nbsp;which are in the same vein.

FLCL is a great example of the potential of Japanese animation as an art form, and I hope people who may be disuaded by reviews of this Blu-ray from less informed critics give this disc a spin for themselves.

Blu ray remastered 3 out of 5 stars

If you are looking for a 1080P remaster of Fooly Clooly on blu ray this is not the thing you should spend full price on ( the sale price was totally worth it).

The Anime FLCL is a superb anime with absolutely no flaws, if you do not own this anime what are you waiting for buy it now it is a totally over the top show with superb animation.

So the Blu-ray:
First: it is not wide screen 16:9

Third: The DVD version I have is unscaled on the PS3 and the blu ray does not look much better
Fourth: the Blu Ray box is nice looking but nothing special comes with the box just the Disc and case.

If you have never bought this Anime get it now, but if you can just stick with the cheaper version because there is no need to spend full MSRP on the Blu Ray version of FLCL",1298505600,3,929,3.8684210526315788

4333323,1,B004DMIIPA,"[Updated February 24, 2011]

The first and only time I saw FLCL was back in the summer of 2003.  Back then, I thought it was the absolute worst anime of all time because the visual styles and characters really got on my nerves.  I realized I was a little on an ""anger high"" when I posted my first draft of my review, hence the revised one you're reading now.  I also realize that FLCL doesn't exactly fall in line with my typical diet in anime (the dark and serious stuff), but even taking that mentality out, I just don't find it all that enjoyable.

STORY

The story to FLCL is that it's a coming-of-age story about a boy named Naota who lives in a city with a giant teapot that he considers boring, then a girl riding on a Vespa named Haruko comes in to town and bashes his head with a bass guitar, then his life turns upside down because robots are popping out of his head and aliens among other things are running amok in the city.

CHARACTERS

I found the characters in FLCL, other than Naota, to be either extremely annoying or impossible to connect with.  The best example of the ""annoying"" characters by far is Haruko.  All I really remember her doing in the show (I saw this show only once back in 2003) is that she runs around screaming and destroying everything with her bass guitar.  I found the other characters in the show, such as Naota's brother's girlfriend and his dad, largely impossible to connect with because instead of subtle moments to allow proper character development.  After some revelations provided from another anime fan, the idiotic and annoying characterizations are supposed to be a huge slam against typical otaku mentality, I just think there could have been much better ways to do this because it robbed much enjoyment I could have had.

JUST PICK ONE OR THE OTHER

After some insight from a good friend of mine more knowledgeable about FLCL than I am, I admit my original assessment of the show mixing a coming-of-age story with loud and over-the-top comedy was off the mark.  I now realize that the over-the-top comedy and horrendously convoluted subplots were all deliberate parodies of the worst anime cliches.  That would have been perfectly fine with me if the show was all about making fun of these cliches, but the combination of the parodies with a legitimate story feels very, very awkward to me.

COMEDY WITHOUT THE LAUGHS

Now even with the points above in mind, you're probably saying ""Can't you just enjoy the comedy in the show and forgive any shortcomings?""  Yes, I probably could, if I actually enjoyed the humor in the show.  Honestly, most of FLCL's humor feels much like half-baked Excel Saga jokes.  While Excel Saga has some spotty moments, I think it's one of comedic anime's high points because not only was it funny (something many comedic anime titles fail at doing, like the horrendously overblown Tenchi Muyo), and felt more refreshing because it was all about ""fun and games"".  The humor itself in FLCL ranges from being painfully grating or really lukewarm in-jokes about anime.  The in-jokes and cultural references were out-of-place within the episodes, and even at a younger age in my years of anime fandom, spotted them miles away.  Har har har, there's a scene where Haruko imitates part of the opening credits to the 70's anime Lupin III, that's some clever stuff there!!  Ooh look, there's a scene with some random South Park-style animation, how genius!!  The previously mentioned anime in-jokes all fall into the ""random"" humor that Excel Saga (mostly) had down to a science, the humor in FLCL feels like half-baked versions of the source material, and it came off more as irritating than anything else (I honestly think FLCL's humor is on par with SpongeBob Squarepants, another unfunny cartoon).  Some people have said to me that the humor has some things to say about the cliches typical in anime, and it probably does, but whatever ""insight"" it can offer is negated by the fact that the anime feels more like an insanity test than a brain-twister.

APPEARANCE

The appearance of FLCL has it's positives and negatives, though mostly negatives.  It's obvious that FLCL was a higher-budget production given the effort put in to achieve a smooth frame rate and to smoothly draw out the characters and environments.  The negative part of this is that the creators thought it would be the most clever thing in history to mash together a bunch of clashing visual styles and it feels unpleasantly awkward.

SOUNDTRACK

While I don't dislike the soundtrack nearly as much as I used to in previous years, I still find it to be pretty bland.  I honestly found most of the tunes forgettable, but I still remember the music credits made by the Japanese pop rock band The Pillows.  I found the music to be very weak, easy-to-digest power pop that's not catchy or fun to listen to.  I realize that this music isn't typical of what I listen to (thrash and death metal), but I can appreciate well-made music that's pleasant to listen to, even if it's not a genre I'm into.  For example, I thought the opening theme to Bubblegum Crash had delightfully catchy melodies and was overall pleasant to listen to, despite it being J-pop.  The Pillows' theme music for FLCL reminds me too much of West Coast pop-punk bands like Green Day, which I can honestly find very little to like about.

FINAL WORD

FLCL could have been a brilliant and much-needed slam against the worst anime cliches, if that's all it aspired to do, but the fact that the humor was overstayed and half-baked, and that the incorporation of a coming-of-age story really makes it feel unpleasantly weird and badly executed.  Gainax's weird methods of animated storytelling really don't sit well with me, but that's just my opinion.  If you want some over-the-top anime comedy, I say just go for some Excel Saga.",1298419200,19,5837,4.7272727272727275
4333324,4,B004DMIIPA,"FLCL is a fun, unique yarn of a story with quirky art that may or may not appeal to everyone, but this Blu-ray should only be bought by those who haven't purchased the DVD releases already.

The music is pleasant and reminisce of American alternative rock in the 90s. For all of the fans' pre-release anxiety for this Blu-Ray... it's not bad at all. In 1080p, it's plainly sharp. I won't claim to know exactly what source material Funimation had to work with and where they got it from. Some scenes look like they easily could have been a new digital render or transfer. Others show signs of an upscaling algorithm, but one that is sensitive to lines (perhaps a vectorization stage?). This release maintains the original for-standard-TV aspect ratio of 4:3. My dropped star is only for the occasionally obvious MPEG, JPEG, or upscaling artifacts in some of the stills and some judder during pans.

The new cover art though is what really makes it for me though. The packaging is amazing and it looks like some one in funi's graphic arts department had been working on this for a while, one might even think before they had it. I am such a huge fan of the series that all the before mentioned was enough for me to re-buy.

If you already own the series though and it didn't change your life as a teenager or lead to you finding your unified theory on life, then its debatable if the $20-30 for the Blu is worth it. Its good but I would only go for it if you can't shut up about the show if someone mentions it.

I was worried that 6 episodes wouldn't be enough or the story would be rushed. While I wished there was more, the show as a whole was satisfying. It is 150 minutes of fun and excitement. I have been waiting to get this series, now that I have it, it has lived up to the hype I have bestowed on it in my anticipation.

There are director commentaries, a couple of videos by The Pillows who do the music for the show, outtakes, text-less openings and ending and FUNimation trailers. The blu ray comes in a nice slipcover. It is a pretty decent effort for FUNimation, considering their normal extras are just trailers and sometimes text-less openings and endings.

I have viewed the entire FUNi blu ray release on my PC and a few minutes on my 50"" Samsung. Both look wonderful. I have seen how it was unwatchable and just terrible. i don't know how they did it, but this release looks good. Not the best, but far from unwatchable, artifact filled garbles.
