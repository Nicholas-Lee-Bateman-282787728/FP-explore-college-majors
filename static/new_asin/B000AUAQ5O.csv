What isn't stated in the product info is that the picture quality is of a full screen VHS-transfer........especially the blacks are really grey and fuzzy.
And you should know before buying that this is NO factory pressed DVD, but a purple burned DVD-R with a printed sticker on the info side.
This might be an offical licensed product, but for buyers it's nice to know what you are buying, and I can imagine that some of you will find $39,95 rather expensive for a product that looks like a homemade burned DVD-R with poor picture quality.
However......it's hard to come by, so if you want to see it you probably have to accept the poor quality.
Decide for yourself....",1524009600,,823,4.605442176870748
8079848,4,B000AUAQ5O,I have the VHS.  It is from 1990 and is 30 minutes long.  The coverage is much more informal than the major documentary companies.,1492560000,,130,4.375
8079849,5,B000AUAQ5O,"I love this movie. Saul Bass gets film like Fellini or Obayashi, but his skill in visual design takes it to another level. If you're into Joseph Campbell and haven't seen ""Quest"", buy it now and buckle up.",1379376000,3,205,4.421052631578948
8079850,5,B000AUAQ5O,"This DVD is the dramatic and entertaining story of the Rod Farb expedition to the wreck of the Civil War ironclad the USS Monitor. This was the first group of non-governmental divers to dive the Monitor. All diving operations were conducted under the close supervision of NOAA.This was beautifully photographed by veteran lensman Ric O'Donnell and narrated and written by Jackie Stone. The video shows a lot of action both on the deck of the dive boat as well as wonderfully clear underwater views of the Monitor and the abundant marine life that now populates this 240ft deep shipwreck. It also contains some beautiful shots of a pod of dolphins as they romp and play around the dive boat and divers.

It also has an interesting mix of divers including filmmaker John McKenny, filmmaker and producer Bob Abrahms and writer/diver Joe Poe. This DVD is a gem and it belongs in the video library of all those who love diving and the sea.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wreck-Hunters-Dive-to-the-Wreck-of-the-USS-Bass/dp/B00079RC1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass</a>",1127779200,,1159,5.5852272727272725
