7790216,5,0783223943,A good start for the Xena Hercules episodes. It starts with the dark side of Xena. Too bad more episodes are not available,1383696000,,122,4.3478260869565215
7790217,5,0783223943,"This is the first episode in which Xena is shown. Not first with Lucy  Lawless (she played an Amazon in an earlier Herc episode) Anyhoo, this tale  is about Xena's darkness ending. When Hercules boldy challenges her reign  of terror, she deviously targets his weak spot by seducing Iolaus and  luring Hercules into a perilous trap. All right Xena. Oops. Love this  episode. You really should get all three episodes as they tend to be one  massive tale about XENA : Warrior Princess",968025600,5,481,4.734939759036145
