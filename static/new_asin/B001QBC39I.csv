8335317,1,B001QBC39I,"The picture is trembling from start to finish. This is a bad sex-comedy, silly and boring. Pallardy's earlier film ""My Body Burns"" (1972) was way better.",1401062400,,153,4.923076923076923
8335318,4,B001QBC39I,"This is a R-rated movie with naked bodies and simulated sex scenes.  Never explicit.  It is on the comic side.  Long-journey truck drivers prefer to stop and spend overnight somewhere midway in a countryside house.  A madam and her few girls are there to
give these truckers complete services from entertainment to sex.  It is kind of oasis in a desert to men.

When looking into reality, this story is of down-to-earth type.  Photography and laughs make this movie quite enjoyable.",1391126400,,482,4.8765432098765435
8335319,4,B001QBC39I,"A truck stop madame & her girls entertain a bunch of older truckers while a competition for the madame's love ensues.  All the while she is pinning for her love, who got lost & has been made into a love slave at an oasis in the desert.  The competition for the madame's love include pleasuring all the girls, watching the girls pleasure each other without getting aroused and more.  It's a funny movie with a few pretty girls thrown in for good measure.",1358553600,,453,4.433734939759036
8335320,5,B001QBC39I,"An erotica film with a plot that shows just how trashy Homer could be.  It's a re-imagining of Homer's Odyssey, where Odysseus (Ulysse, in this version) is a trucker delivering refrigerators who's been too-long on the road.  His wife (Pamela) waits for him loyally as men loiter at Ulysse' home, a busy truck stop.  Along the way, Ulysse is ""regretfully"" sidetracked by the sorceress Calypso (played by post-op transsexual Ajita Wilson), waylaid by bandits and makes a narrow escape from a big-boned, lusty cyclops bartender.  Meanwhile, Pamela wards off suitors with excuses, and her waitresses make up impossible sexual contests a suitor must overcome in order to win Pamela's hand.  Rather than the two decades Odysseus was lost in the Odyssey, Ulysse is gone for a year, but that's not bad for a soft-core flick.  This film would likely give students of classical literature a migraine, but I thought that it was a lot of fun, and much more thoughtful than what passes for parody in recent years.

""Truck Stop"" (a.k.a. ""L'amour chez les poids lourds"") is a good example of 70s-era European erotica, albeit softcore.  There are plenty of topless scenes, implied sex, but probably more on the high end of ""R"" than an adult movie.  It's got corny dialogue, artistic pretensions it couldn't possibly fulfil, and a fair but silly voice-over.  Know what you're getting into, but I liked it.",1256428800,12,1388,4.943965517241379
