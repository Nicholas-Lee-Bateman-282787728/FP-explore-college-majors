7956442,4,B00005Y6ZC,"This film has been newly released (November 2009) on the Arthaus label distributed by Naxos. There is no separate listing on Amazon under its new UPC code. It has a different cover and contains a 35-photo slide show as its bonus. The original film was made in 1988 and this is a basic transfer of the film. It has not been restored and does appear grainy in parts. That said, here is my review:

More than a documentary about this world famous photographer, best known for his fashion photos and nude photos of women in unusual and erotic positions, this is a series of ""living photos"", as we follow Newton as he shoots these models and the photos come to life. The narrator gives us the basic facts and the rest consists of interviews with Newton, who definitely has a big ego but can be very funny as well, along with his wife and his models, both famous (Candace Bergen and Catherine Deneuve) and not. WE don't learn about his growing up years - that would have been nice - but, rather, on his life during his productive, and lucrative, years. He refers to his high fee often.

The film is rather long - at 100 minutes - but there's such beauty in the women he shoots that you don't mind. You won't learn anything about photography here, nor much about Newton's background, but you won't be bored. You will experience pop culture in Monte Carlo and Los Angeles (his two homes) in the 80s as you follow him to his favorite haunts.

If you like Newton's photographs, and especially if you enjoy great black and white photographs of nude females, you will definitely like this film. Though not perfect, its worth seeking out in this new release.

7956443,3,B00005Y6ZC,I have never been a fan of Newton but I got the DVD to learn more about him. Interesting but not great. I have seen other DVD on other famous photographers much more interesting and done better,1191283200,,193,4.243243243243243
7956444,4,B00005Y6ZC,"This is a fun documentary on Helmut Newton. I was at his lecture at the New School and the film gives you the same feel for him and his work. Most of the photos are sexy, he has a wonderful photographic identity, you can always spot his work. The DVD and video (they are not exactly the same) are worth watching for any serious fashion or commercial photographer. This is not a how to do a photo DVD. However, if you pay attention he tells you a lot about how he likes to work. Straight ahead, almost no camera hardware or crew and lots of vision. You know he saw the shot before he took it.",1121817600,6,591,4.103448275862069

7956446,4,B00005Y6ZC,"Well my local video stores didn't carry the film so... I ordered it online. It's very interesting to see how the man worked, both with his Hasselblad and behind the scenes. He obviously didn't have the internet to find his fetish models so he had agencies and associates recruit talent for him. Let me tell you-it was a LOT harder to find willing nude fetish models 30 years ago. (The term ""fetish"" I don't believe was used during the entire movie which was completed in 1988).

Very much a perfectionist, Helmut was quite the control freak as well. Everything from posing the models to ordering his printers to make enlargements to his stringent specifications. None of his images were left to chance. They were extremely calculated and technically expert. He took very few actual photographs during the shoots from what I can tell, but the ones he did take were absolutely spot on.

He and his wife lived quite a lavish lifestyle-staying in exquisite chateaus and hotels in some rather upscale cities of the world. Truly a voyeur, he peered through his telescope at the topless sunbathing women at his hotel's swimming pool. He wasn't actively 'nice' to his models it seems. He complained that they couldn't stand still enough or give him the look he was going for. Nevertheless, he found stunning models to work with and did absolutely incredible large-scale art so you have got to hand it to him. The video is worth owning if you're a fan of Newton or the history of fetish art.

7956447,2,B00005Y6ZC,"I was very dissapointed when i saw this DVD.  I had just seen the fantastic Richard Avedon DVD the night before.
I didn't know anything about Helmut Newton, and i wish i did... because it would of saved me the time and money i spent on this dvd.  Newton's work is quite flat, uninspired and for the most part sexist (...).
If you are interested in photography, see the Avedon video instead.",1087948800,2,390,4.402777777777778
7956448,3,B00005Y6ZC,"Good bio. Gives you the life and times of this man. Some nudity, but overall the whole DVD was just okay. Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering.",1053388800,3,150,4.592592592592593
7956449,3,B00005Y6ZC,"Seeing Helmut for the male pig that he really is or seeing those poor women lose all self respect as they posed for him. Nevertheless his work is wonderful and it was nice seeing exactly how he does it. I loved it from an artistic point of view, it really gets into his head and reveals what we may not want to see... he's just a simple guy who likes to make money and his reputation have gotten larger than life and women throw themselves at him. Or, the fact that he's just plain damned GOOD! Helmut's work is captivating, very rich in tone and contrast, and quite frankly spellbinding. You'll enjoy this DVD especially if you are a photography student or pro.",1046217600,21,662,4.390243902439025
