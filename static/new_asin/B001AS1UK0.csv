8279309,5,B001AS1UK0,"After surfing for 40 years, I've found that my balance and reflexes have been getting worse. My sessions were getting shorter because of severe shoulder pain that only happens from a lot of paddling. I had never done Yoga before and decided to give this DVD a try since it was specific to surfing and other board sports. I am so happy I did! In just a few weeks, my balance has improved and my shoulder doesn't hurt from paddling any more. Adding this DVD to my excerise routine a couple times a week has made surfing fun again for me instead of painful.",1282089600,,554,4.336538461538462
8279310,2,B001AS1UK0,"This video is very simple as a pre and post workout with a 20 minute segment for both and some filler in between. I have been surfing for a while now and doing yoga, even not have been on a regular weekly yoga schedule (like 4 months) I really didn't get much of anything out of this video, Just a lot of simple stretching excersises that a good surfer would do any ways for the arms but not worth the cashe. If your looking for a workout type of yoga video, go with something eles. If your looking for a surf related excersise video look at ""Surf Excersises"" that is designed by a surf trainer and shows how it is useful in all aspects of surfing. Nicely done just not hard enough for me or intense, mellow vibes and too easy.",1257379200,,727,4.163120567375887

A great surprise! I have used Yoga for flexibility and balance, but had no clue that it could actually help me with snowboarding. This Yoga Surfing DVD does! One of my favorite aspects of this DVD is the ""post recovery..."" doing yoga after boarding truly is key to being able to flow, enjoy, and experience that feeling of ""flying"" on powder. I love it (not to mention all the relief in post soreness)! If you are a snowboarder, this video is a great enhancer to the sport and something I would recommend to anyone on a board!",1245369600,,823,6.283185840707965
