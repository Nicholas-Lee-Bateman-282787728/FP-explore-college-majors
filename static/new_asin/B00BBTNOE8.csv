5570518,1,B00BBTNOE8,How much beer and dope do you need to consume to make this movie funny? My guess is an amount that would cause permanent brain damage. Not funny at all. Not scary at all. Not anything at all.,1378598400,5,191,4.052631578947368
5570519,3,B00BBTNOE8,"Let's start this off by saying I'M that guy who brings ""Hot Fuzz"" to parties and proudly puts it alongside such landmarks as Airplane and Spinal Tap as being an all-time comedic favorite.

SO, gleefully, on opening day of this film I forced two good friends to attend with me a viewing of The World's End. And...

I'm sorry. I WANTED to love it... sitting in the theater, increasingly disappointed, I nearly FORCED myself to! Now, by all means, it most certainly does have some funny moments (and, frankly, it's a better film than most the emerge from Hollywood), but the film seemed... too self-conscious? Tried too hard? No. Perhaps it was that I felt Simon Pegg (and I'm a big fan!) was actually miscast in this part. The laughs did not emerge immediately for me, nor even as the film began to progress... but I did crack a couple of grins. Perhaps I'm being too hard on the film, based on previous expecations... but isn't that a point of contention? It simply lacked the wit and ""lightness"" of the previous Cornetto entries. To me, at least.

In fairness, the movie improved as it went along in terms of humor, though it was still a bit a heavy, mildly confused and was sustained by an utterly unbelievable plotline (to steadfastly continue the pub-crawl... REALLY?? Even a beer-lover like me knows his limits).

THAT all said, I would probably give a higher review of the film on its own merits, but in lieu of previous efforts, I'm afraid Pegg, Frost and Wright could have put on something a bit more witty. My two cents.",1378166400,7,1528,4.586080586080586
5570520,5,B00BBTNOE8,"""The World's End, the last film in the Cornetto trilogy by Edgar Wright, does not disappoint with its outlandish and original premise about five men living out their disillusioned youth to go to their hometown to visit 12 pubs only to find out something they weren't ready for. Without revealing too much, the film manages to make satire among many things like British mannerisms and culture, alcoholism, relationships, partying, and ultimately...robots, aliens, and the apocalypse. Cor blimey!

Simon Pegg provides an intriguingly bizarre role as Gary King, a deranged alcoholic who just wants to have a good time and keeps quoting Primal Scream's song Loaded as well as many other classic tunes from the 1990s era of British music (which complement the film excellently and humorously with acts like Happy Mondays, The Stone Roses, and The Housemartins, a band that kick-started Fatboy Slim in the music industry). Nick Frost (Pegg's usual companion in the Cornetto films) complements a more restrained role here but the stars that steal the show include Pierce Brosnan as a uptight, port-drinking teacher and Eddie Marsan playing a nervous recluse (which is a strong turn from his role as a disturbing abusive husband in Tyrannosaur).

In addition, the film builds its craziness strong by offering some stylish and intriguingly kinetic action and special effects work, cartoonish hilarity, and random moments especially one involving a supercomputer voiced by Bill Nighy questioning about the failure of humanity. The humour is all in the irony and is more uncertain and aloof than This is the End (which is still funny at parts but feels a little generic with all the sex jokes) and more comical, less pretentious, and more nonsense than Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (which was one of the worst films and so-called comedies in recent years). A few points of concern is how it had the unfortunate time being released near to This is the End (think Deep Impact and Armageddon) and how the BBFC and MPAA did not manage to indicate there was as much gore, violence, and drinking the film had (only profanity and sex references were indicated). Its a 15 certificate in the UK and an R rating in America but the gory nastiness, which is all in blue ink, could be off-putting for some.

All-in-all, the film was much more of a blast than I could have expected given its less-than-stellar return in box office returns in Great Britain. While this may offend fans but this film makes Shaun of the Dead look like over-hyped, slightly boring drivel. It is more in-line with Hot Fuzz which was a very strong police parody in its own right as well as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (directed by Edgar Wright but is a stand-alone film) and Paul (which, contrary to popular belief, is not part of the Cornetto trilogy) with their outlandish but funny premises. Whether you are in need of some shiny light of humour (albeit dark and ironic in this film) or anything, you cannot go wrong with The World's End.""",1377648000,9,3007,4.8576998050682265
5570521,5,B00BBTNOE8,"Comedy is hard.  Delivering consistently  outstanding comedies seems near impossible these days, but with The World's End the team of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost have delivered yet another hilarious, genre bending film, this time setting their scopes on classic science-fiction.  The film features the action comedy one would expect from the team, but also succeeds in arguably possessing Simon Pegg's best performance to date.

The World's End begins on a semi-realistic note.  Four friends in 1990 attempted to complete the Golden Mile: 12 pubs, 12 pints, one night.  All of them have moved on to productive careers except for the former ringleader Gary King (Simon Pegg).  After suffering a psychiatric breakdown and determined to regain his youth Gary coerces the group together to take one last shot at the Golden Mile. But coming home isn't always easy as the gang soon discovers that the townspeople are being replaced by robots.  Despite all this Gary leads the gang onward determined to reach the final pub: The World's End.

Simon Pegg as Gary King is childish, pitiful, and manipulative which makes for a great role reversal with Nick Frost (who has played goofy characters in the previous films) now being the serious, take charge figure of the group.  The science-fiction plot is handled with great care and is inspired most directly by Invasion of the Body Snatchers and with some elements of apocalyptic fiction.  Particularly worth noting when discussing the robots is Pierce Brosnan, who arrives as the boy's former teacher and nails a chilling speech detailing the unknown alien entity's plans.  If you enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy brand of sci-fi absurdity than you'll feel right at home.

As with any Edgar Wright film the audience is also treated to several unique action scenes as the fellas tear their way through the army of robot townsfolk, spilling blue blood wherever they go.  Edgar Wright is an inventive director and is clearly right in his element, and although they don't top the shootout in Hot Fuzz you're bound to be entertained by these sequences.

Of the trilogy The World's End is the most emotional the team has delivered.  We laugh, but Gary King's life is a tragedy and Simon Pegg's performance perfectly captures a man stuck in the past. There's still the absurdity, and tongue-in-cheekness of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, but The World's End has a meatier emotional center because of Simon Pegg's performance.  If you loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz you'll undoubtedly love The World's End.  It is a thoughtful comedy despite its absurdity and is sure to leave you with a smile on your face.",1377561600,70,2669,4.946188340807175
5570522,5,B00BBTNOE8,"I admit that one of the reasons why ""The World's End"" caught my attention was because of a strong intuitive feeling that my husband would enjoy this movie.  I was able to successfully convince him to check out ""The World's End."" This is because both ""The World's End"" trailer and ad reminded me a little of Shaun of The Dead.  My spouse had previously watched Shaun of the Dead back in 2004 and greatly enjoyed it.  Fortunately, my husband loved ""The World's End"" even more.  ""The Worlds End"" follows the crazy and comical events of high school buddies who reunite years later to recapture some of the fun energy from their youth.  The men soon learn an important lesson that an environment and the people are definitely sometimes different from what is projected on the surface.  The actors harmoniously gave natural performances as friends who have a lot of catching up to do.  The music played in the film also caught my interest, particularly when they enter the mermaid club, if only I knew the names of the songs featured when they were in this club (such as in the scene with their encounters with the ""marmalade twins"").  The following is the listing of the actors/actress that are shown reuniting with each other: Martin Freeman (The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey), Simon Pegg (Star Trek Into Darkness), Nick Frost (Paul), Paddy Considine (The Bourne Ultimatum), Eddie Marsan (Jack The Giant Slayer), and Rosamund Pike (Jack Reacher).  ""The World's End"" is an entertaining choice for those who like comic books and/or science fiction themes.",1377388800,9,1550,4.885496183206107
5570523,4,B00BBTNOE8,"In the event that you're unfamiliar with the work of Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, they were originally stars of a British television comedy, Spaced - which was directed by Edgar Wright.  After the series ran its course over a span of two years (1999-2001), the duo took to the big screen, starring in 2004's horror comedy, Shaun of the Dead, which was written by Pegg and Wright, and also directed by Wright.  After the success and acclaim of Shaun of the Dead, the trio reteamed in 2007's action comedy, Hot Fuzz.  With another successful film under their belts, Edgar Wright went on to write and direct the comic book film, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, while Simon Pegg joined the Star Trek franchise.  In 2011, Pegg and Frost reunited by writing and starring in the sci-fi comedy, Paul.  As usual, the duo struck gold with a hefty box office pay day and above average acclaim. But, the trio still had unfinished business together, agreeing to team-up one last time to put an end to the collaboration that has become known as The Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.  The third and final chapter to the trilogy is The World's End.

Written by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright and directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), The World's End stars Simon Pegg as Gary King, an unfulfilled alcoholic that continuously reflects on the days of his youth.  One night in their youth, Gary and his friend attempted to conquer the Golden Mile (a pub crawl consisting of 12 different pubs), in their hometown of Newton Haven - culminating at the final pub, called The World's End.  Unfortunately, Gary and his friends were unable to beat the mile in their first attempt, and since that night, everything has changed for Gary's friends - new jobs, married lives, kids, etc.  Sadly, nothing has changed for Gary and he is determined to get the boys, Oliver (Martin Freeman), Peter (Eddie Marsan), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost), back together for one more attempt at the mile.  But, when they are finally reunited, they discover their hometown is not quite right - and neither are the inhabitants.  Pierce Brosnan, Rosamund Pike, and Bill Nighy also star in supporting roles.

In the event that this is really the end of Edgar Wright's iconic Three Flavours Cornetto saga, they've certainly gone out with a bang.  Actually, bang would be a demoralizing understatement considering the sheer brilliance of the writing and acting incorporated in this final chapter - and the entire series, really.  Like the two previous films, The World's End is once again dominated by the series' illustrious leader, Simon Pegg, followed closely by his side-kick, Nick Frost.  Unlike previous films, Nick Frost takes on more of a serious role as opposed to his previous, loose-lipped portrayals.  Oddly enough, it works to Frost's benefit, messing perfectly with Pegg's character, which is ridiculously irresponsible and completely immature (not that his previous roles weren't).  Even though the roles of Pegg and Frost have changed drastically over the course of the trilogy, they've only managed to improve their stature in terms of the overall quality of entertainment.  The characters in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were significant in their own rights, but the roles of Pegg and Frost in this film are much ambitious and verbally witty.  This final installment also includes the appearances by several recognizable faces that have previously made appearances in the franchise, including Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Bill Nighy.

Several scenes stick out over the course of The World's End, most notably of which include nearly any and every character exchange with the tyrannical Gary King (Simon Pegg).  Plus, the scenes that have the 5 gents physically facing off with the zombie-like robots - who have taken over the town.  The first fight scene, which we will simply call the bathroom battle royal, introduces the film's villains, quickly leading to a brawl within the men's restroom.  If this scene were shot on a mat surrounded by ring ropes, it would certainly resemble a wrestling match featured in the WWE.  The fights appear to be well choreographed and absurdly hilarious, providing for plenty of messy humor and ironic jokes.  While these dense robots are responsible for being the antagonist, they are relatively unthreatening.  Mainly, their only purpose is to serve as a vehicle that eventually helps heal wounds and mend rifts that have divided Pegg's character from the rest of the group.

While 95 percent of the film is entertaining, the climax is a bit too extreme.  Obviously, it's hard to discuss the events in detail here without spoiling it, but needless to say, the ending doesn't really fit with the general pace of the film.  For the most part, The World's End is a theme-driven, dialogue heavy comedy (with occasional action in the later half) focusing on one man's ambition to be happy and finish something he started with his friends several years prior.  The majority of this film is fun-loving and cheeky, filled with charisma and smart, dry humor - but the ending sort of blows the whole movie out of proportion, leading to a brash, impromptu set of circumstance.  Honestly, it doesn't ruin the film by any means, but it wouldn't be a shocker to hear that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright had a few different endings in mind for the film.

Overall, The World's End is one of the smartest, well-written comedies of the year.  The acting is quite smashing (imagine that being said with a British accent), too.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost really make a case for this film to be their best film yet.  This might be the end of a trilogy, but it's certainly not the end of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost adventures - which have the potential to be remembered as some of the greatest comedies ever concocted.  Odds are you won't die from laughter during this film, but it does have its moments of honest humor.  One thing is for sure, with the ambitious direction of Edgar Wright and the brilliant pairing of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, you won't regret watching The World's End.  And, if you're wondering - no, you don't need to see Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz prior to watching The World's End.  The beauty of this franchise is they were all created as stand along stories for anyone and everyone to enjoy.

5570524,4,B00BBTNOE8,"This is a theatrical review and there may be spoilers...unless you've seen the trailers.

This hilarious British comedy features the same folks who brought us ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" so get ready for a good time.  This time out, 5 old friends decide to return to their small home town best known for having the world's first roundabout and The Golden Mile.  The later features a series of 12 pubs concluding at The World's End.  Twenty years earlier the boys only made it half way before youthful drinking incapacitated them.

Four of the five have moved on, but Gary King (Simon Pegg) aka ""The King"" (how original) hasn't.  He still wears the same tee-shirt over the same long trench coat that he did we he was 20.  He still drives the same car (The Beast), is still irresponsible and well, you get the picture.  He decides it would be a good idea to go back home and start over and this time complete their original goal of 1 pint of beer (minimum) at each of the 12 pubs.  The other 4, Andy (Nick Frost), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Peter (Eddie Marsan), reluctantly give in and off they go.

Along the way, we get plenty of in-the-car-bickering mostly between the alcoholic Gary and the now teetotaler Andy.  Directed and co-written (with Pegg) by Edgar Wright, we get just the right amount of obnoxiousness from Gary without wanting to strangle him.  In other words, he's funny.  Now all of these would seem a bit much after a while as the guys get progressively drunk, but things get a bit weird.  At first Gary notices that the bartenders don't recognize him.  Others seem to be the same age as they were when he left.  Rosamund Pike is introduced midway as the Oliver's sister and former love crush of Steven and Gary.  It's pretty much a thankless role.  But she being sober, notices the same aloofness of the locals.

If you've seen the trailers, you know that the town has been overrun by some strangers who ooze blue blood and emit bright light from their eyes and mouth.  Androids to be sure, but the boys just call them robots.  In fact, in one of the funnier scenes, the guys sit around the table, pints in hand, and try to come up a name for the robots.  Unable to reach a consensus they just call them the ""blanks.""  Got to love it.  As the quintet continue their mission, they have to avoid the ""blanks"" who want the guys to adapt rather than fight.

But the guys are more concerned about getting to The World's End.  For Gary, it is clearly his mission in life.  The final act is a doozy with some surprisingly funny and well-staged fight scenes and some hilarious byplay between Gary and a character played by Bill Nighy.",1377388800,25,2679,4.504149377593361

The Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy ends in a very epic way. Shaun of the Dead was a gore fest Zombie film, Hot Fuzz was an over the top, non-stop action romp. The World's End is a sci-fi flick that for me, seemed very reminiscent of Doctor Who. These films may just seem like they are paying homage to genre films on the surface, but all three of these films are anchored in friendship and maturing and have a believable, emotional weight to them. I thought the very epic ending to The World's End was f#@&ing brilliant. I also enjoyed the way the Corentto Ice Cream was worked into this film, the gags that parallel Shaun and Fuzz, the whole thing is done very cleverly. Great soundtrack with tons of songs from the 1990's, great one liners like we've come to expect from Wright and Pegg's writing. Don't listen to the critics giving this a mediocre review. It's hard to say which of the three films I like best, I suppose it depends on my mood. The story and characters of The World's End resonated with me maybe even more so than Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. It's a very fitting third act to this trilogy. It certainly made me laugh more than Hot Fuzz. If you liked Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, or even love them as I do, you won't be disappointed with The World's End.

5570526,5,B00BBTNOE8,"What a great movie! I've never seen a ""remake"" movie that was better than the original, especially when the original was as brilliant as Shawn of the Dead. Substitute killer robots for zombies and ""World's End Pub"" for ""Winchester Pub"" and then look for all the wonderful ""homages"" to the classic original- they're everywhere! ""Jumping"" the fence and mimicking robots/zombies to 'blend' are just a few. The story, comedy, and the originality are amazing. I believe it is extremely difficult to repeat anything in movies without it looking like you're just ""cashing in"" on an older hit- but it isn't like that at all. World's End stand on it's own as one of the best comedy movies in years- possibly the best since Shawn of the Dead. Loved it! Some may not like the phrase ""remake"", but whatever you call it, please see it. Reviewers: list other movies that are ""remakes"" or pay homage throughout (not just one thing like ""I'll be back"") to a prior movie by the same lead actor(s).

5570551,5,B00BBTNOE8,"I will be frank here, I have never seen the previous two films of the trilogy so I cannot say how good they are. However! World's End is sufficiently self explanatory to be regarded as a standalone film in its own right where you get introduced to the 5 oddball friends that get together to fulfill their dream of a successful pub crawl in their home village.

Simon Pegg plays the mentally unstable Gary King that suffers from delusions of grandeur coupled with a blatant alcohol and drug problem that cannot seem to get his act together and fervishly lives in the past. He manages to escape a mental institution and recruits his old childhood friends to a legendary pub crawl with a mixture between begging and deceit. Gary is so ballsy that he asks 3 of the friends to lend him 100 pounds that he gives to the friend that holds the strongest grudge because he went to jail as a juvenile due to him.

After reaching their old village, the pub crawl seems to start normally with the expected tension due to Gary's past mistakes. And then things go weird for no reason when they discover most of the inhabitants of the village have been cloned by a strange alien race while the originals end up killed and turned into compost. The group must find the way to pretend to act normal and finish the crawl before they become the next batch of victims to this malignant scheme.

Aimed at making this a silly comedy instead of a drama, the acting was great, the characters memorable and the tension nonstop that keeps you engaged. Gary's character is a delight to watch despite his massive defects and you just want to start rooting for him to achieve his long lost dream of finishing the pub crawl suitably at the Worlds End Tavern.

If people claim that the previous movies are so much better than this one (already a huge feat because this film is undoubtedly very funny), I'll just have to find the way to see the full trilogy and see for myself.",1508025600,,1943,4.480225988700565

This film lives up to his other great titles, this a home run for any Shawn of the Dead fans in particular! A great cast supports an interesting story in this action packed comedy, each adding a unique flavor to their characters. You will be surprised what familiar faces you come across along the way. Overall, I thought that the choice to keep the introduction of the film brief was the right call, as it sets up the story while allowing it to progress quickly. Unexpected turns will have you raising eyebrows, dropping jaws and slapping your knees with laughter! A must see film for any Simon Pegg fan, the World's End is a true hit!

5570574,4,B00BBTNOE8,"Very entertaining.  The setup in particular is very funny.  I was expecting one thing from the setup, but the movie goes off into left field part way through; way, way into left field.  But don't let this deter you, there is plenty fun still to be had, and lessons to be learned.

Simon Pegg plays a guy looking to relive the good old days.  He peaked in high school, and his life hasn't progressed since then.  He wants to go to the well tonight, and do some talking about Glory Days, to quote The Boss.  He gets his old school friends back together to complete an epic pub crawl in their hometown.

The plot is crazy and it isn't as good as the other Nick Frost/Simon Pegg offerings (especially Hot Fuzz).  However, this is a rollicking good time.  Simon Pegg plays his 40 year old arrested development character perfectly.  It suits him so well, you wonder what his life might have been had he not become a movie star.  Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) plays the love interest, and the other supporting characters are all well played.  But it is Nick Frost, playing the seemly trodden-down friend from high school that really shines.  During the climax, he rises to the occasion spectacularly.  Playing the hero suits him better than I would have guessed from his other movies.

I am off now to watch it again.  I was laughing so much that I missed a lot of the jokes.",1494374400,,1364,4.4574898785425106

And, whoo, yep, Gary King, a mere fiction, owns me, and I will never like this ""art,"" simply because the Gary character is such an odious jerk, and that he is mindfully authored and meant to be a serious emotional bother in the nervous systems of the viewers.  Didn't like him and was constantly eye-jabbed by his sharp stick -- maybe once every three seconds he's on screen.  He ruins not just the fictional world but those of the viewers' also in that any possible ending that doesn't result in Gary be tortured to death and brought back to life ten times a day for 40 years is not going to be good-enough ending.

The supporting cast was great as well and it was nice to see some familiar faces like Rosamund Pike and Martin Freeman as well as some returns from the 2 previous movies.,1463529600,,371,4.470588235294118

Pegg's character wasn't really totally likeable but still entertaining.  You probably know that the town is occupied by non-humans, and so while the violence is frequent it's not the same as watching humans get dismembered.  The characters make some odd choices during the movie, leaving you thinking ""why?"", but honestly it's not a big deal.

5570741,4,B00BBTNOE8,"If you liked Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz you'll probably want to see The World's End, part three of the 'Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy'.

The World's End is a bit more downbeat than the other two films. In this one Simon Pegg is Gary, a thirty something loser trying to re-live his teenage years of inebriated bar-hopping.
He attempts to unite his childhood friends from the small town Newton Haven to join him in 'The Golden Mile', that is visiting all twelve bars in town and hoisting a pint in each one.

Gary's friends include Andy(Nick Frost), Steven(Paddy Considine) and hilarious real estate salesman Oliver(Martin Freeman). They have settled into adult lives with careers and families, and are reluctant to indulge in drunken teenage shenanigans.
Gary with his manic energy similar to Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest persuades his buddies to join him on his quest to complete The Golden Mile.

The town of Newton Haven isn't quite the way the boys remember it. Apparently most of the town's people have been replaced by androids, led by Guy Shepherd, the boys' old school teacher.
Shepherd, in an inspired bit of casting, is played with panache by ex James Bond Pierce Brosnan.

Will the boys finish The Golden Mile or will it finish them?
The World's End is a thoughtful science fiction parody/homage with a good cast, clever effects and a rocking soundtrack.",1444348800,,1391,4.831932773109243

5570822,4,B00BBTNOE8,"The Worlds End
 The Worlds End is the third and for now final episode in the Cornetto Trilogy.  Non English folk will need a translation.  Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright also co-wrote Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  Edgar Wright directed all three films.  Simon Pegg and his pal Nick Frost stared in all three comedies.  Pegg, Frost and writer/director Wright go back to their time together in the English TV show Spaced which began production in 1999.  Why Cornetto?  What is Cornetto?  English snackers know an ice cream confection similar to the American drumstick as a Cornetto.  In each of the three movies Pegg eats a particular flavor of the confection, one with a red wrapper in Shaun (for blood in the Zombie film) a blue wrapper in Fuzz (blue for police uniforms) and green in Worlds End (green for little green men, the alien theme.)
 These guys take their time on screen seriously.  The Worlds End deals with five mature men who attempt to regain their lost youth by finishing a quest they began on the night they graduated from high school.  They attempt the Golden Mile, a journey in their ancestral village to quaff beer in each of the 12 pubs there-a gallon and a half of beer.  By the third or fourth pub the pals are plastered.  When they discover a plot by space aliens to dominate the earth by replacing selected people with people looking robots, they are too messed up to think of anything to do except finish their original quest.  With Pegg and Wright as the writers the set up of drunken friends saving the Earth from alien conquest turns out to be very funny.  Three laughing saw blades for this one.  Fans of Pegg and Frost will enjoy this movie and find many reasons to laugh.  Never mind Simon Pegg, fans of silly fun will like The Worlds End.  The title by the way is a play on the name of pub number 12 on their route.
 Also featured in supporting roles are Rosamund Pike (Wrath of the Titans, Jack Reacher) and Pierce Brosnan (James Bond) with Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest) as the voice of the alien presence.
 The producers shelled out a modest $20 million to make the film and have been richly rewarded by more than $44 million at the box office.  The film lasts one hour and 49 minutes.  It fully deserves the R rating for horrid language.
 In a strange coincidence, the plot is almost identical to the plot in the 2009 film Doghouse.  In Doghouse the friends return to their home town for a pub crawl only to find that all the men have been murdered and the women possessed by demons.  I don't know what to say about that as even one of the camera shots is identical in each film.",1427500800,,2639,4.4324324324324325
5570823,3,B00BBTNOE8,"Haven't even seen Shaun of the Dead yet but screened this one last night after a certain
Gothic rock blog and web site recommended a recent film in which the main hero was a Sisters of Mercy
fanatic (Pegg), which sounded unusual enough.  Since I've been one since the mid 80s or so, I had to of course watch this.
Well, this movie is totally ridiculous and I wasn't really laughing out loud but towards the end
it picks up considerably.  The serious side of this film seems to me almost an allegory of
how these kids of the late 80s and 1990s have mainly grown up and have serious careers
and adult issues but Pegg's King Goth has had other issues and refuses to grow up and
doesn't fit in with this 21st Century lame-o cookie cutter bland world he finds himself stuck in.  The hometown
alien ""robot"" invasion is thus metaphor for the planky nightmare of the 21st Century and
how these new generations of kids (mainly) have zero taste in music or much else.
Pod people and all that.  At least that's what I took away from it, basically being from
this same generation and having graduated from college in the USA in 1992.  I often didn't
know whether to laugh or cry, which is perhaps part of the problem here. Or perhaps Pegg
is also having a poke at the Sad Old Goths/punks who refuse to move with the times,
or on the flipside, a tribute to same (staying true to their ideals but at what cost) in the same breath?

I wasn't always that knocked out by a lot of the 1990s waves of music (Seattle, acid house,
rave culture which never took off here anyway as far as I can tell, grunge to a degree although I liked some of those bands, things just mainly got worse as the decade went on--for every good band like the Las. The Lemonheads, the greatly
underrated Del Amitri, The Blake Babies, Alice in Chains, the good but perhaps somewhat overrated Smashing Pumpkins,
or St. Etienne we had to suffer the likes of vastly overrated and egomaniacal Oasis, absurd nonsense like Right Said Fred, and stuff like
Alanis Morrissette and such, whilst bands I even met in person like the JudyBats or The Innocence
Mission had some initial commercial success but were mainly fighting a losing battle against encroaching
trends and just plain bad taste, as it sadly turned out).

And I'm still a huge Sisters fan too, Simon, refusing to give up the Ghost, as it were.
Even though I don't think this film is as much a laugh riot as one might've hoped, at least
it does have some actual serious subtexts to it, and operates on more than just sex and
drugs and bathroom humor levels even though it contains some of that as well.  Everybody in the
cast is great, a classic cameo by Pierce Brosnan as a former teacher of our pub-crawling heroes
who is considering the pros and cons of an alliance with invading ""aliens"", and any film that features a hero wearing
a black trenchcoat and Sisters logo t-shirt as well as end credits featuring a good deal of
""This Corrosion"" gets my vote almost by default.  I fear though that this film will get mainly blank
stares in the USA from any viewers under the age of 40 or so, the Sisters of Who?  Isn't Katy Perry
in this?  It's just hopeless.  Plus anybody who doesn't grok the Apocalyptic theme vs. the Sisters' ""gloriously
stupid"" Epic O' Doom will just not get much of this movie and particularly the absurdist dystopian ending.

In summation I enjoyed this pint-guzzling goofball film but didn't think it rated 4-5 stars by any stretch despite
all efforts by a very talented cast and crew and a fairly clever screenplay. I hear Shaun of the Dead is far
superior and that's next on my list for Simon Pegg films.",1426723200,,3638,4.460843373493976

It doesn't hurt that Pegg gives what is probably his best and most nuanced performance in any film. Frost is also in top form, playing somewhat against type in this one. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, and keeping things focused on the pub crawl and characters keep things anchored even as the overall tone changes as the film goes on.",1423094400,,754,4.236111111111111

It is a spoof on science fiction, specifically on ""alien invasion"" films, as Shaun of the Dead was a well-done spoof on classic zombie films and Hot Fuzz, their comedic version of the classic cop-team film.  Basically a group of friends, notorious boozers and fighters in their youth, reunite for a classic tour of 12 bars on the main street of their home townthe last pub aptly named Worlds End.  During the course of their carousing, they begin to notice the people aren't quite the same.  No, it's not just that the friends they knew have been replaced by younger people they don't recognizetheyve been replaced by ALIENSnot that anyone is supposed to take this seriously of course, but the ageing friends decide they simply MUST complete the Worlds End classic, even if the world might really be coming to an end!  In a sense, it's loosely a counterpart to the brilliant and probably under-appreciated ""The Watch"" with Ben Stiller.  The movie ends with a confrontation with our rowdy crew and the aliens bent on taking over our species.  I suppose to give away the outcome would be to spoil the plot for anyone who hasn't watched it.  In any case, it's rather the opposite of the American stereotype of British (based, I guess, on the upper class and those aspiring to it) as more reserved; this crowd is blue collar and about as rowdy as they get.  In this case, I'll take the more reserved ""The Watch"", but fans of Pegg and Write, I'm sure, will want to see it.

5570888,4,B00BBTNOE8,"Uncomfortable.

Which is how I honestly felt for the first half-an-hour of this flick. Figured the boys had gone soft; Pegg and Wright's attempt to address the fact that they are in fact middle-aged; the salad days of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaced/dp/B0019MFY3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaced</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>' now behind them.

Pegg's character, Gary, was such an unappealing plonker. A pathetic dude forever stuck in his youth, desperately trying to re-live the past, played out as your typical mid-life crisis to the embarrassment of former friends and family.

Ah. But they got me.

Right. Well done boys. Well done. :-D

Just as you think you've walked into some half-baked character study - a small discordant note. The tiniest hint that not everything is as it appears. Paying attention to little details is key.

And suddenly - the boys are back in town!

The story opens as Gary introspectively looks back in time. He believes with all his heart where things went wrong, where his life took the incorrect path, was when he and his cohorts failed to complete a famous high school graduation tradition - The Golden Mile. A mind-numbing ale-laden drunken circuit of the town's 12 pubs, consuming several pints at each station over the course of a single night, finishing at The World's End - the last pub in the crawl. Many have attempted it, few have found glory.

So, in order to set the universe right, he has to get the ol' gang back together.

Easier said than done.

Gary's done many of his old mates wrong. And old hurts are rarely healed if not properly attended to when first injured. Unsurprisingly the guys balk.

But last favors are called in, promises of finality are made, and the call of history awaits if they're finally able to mark this down as complete in their collective bucket list.

One last final charge at the battlements as the former chums begrudgingly trudge their way into the night.

A night that will literally finish at and with the world's end.

I won't spoil it since it's possible, however unlikely, that anyone reading this might not yet have seen the film.

Suffice to say that Pegg, Frost, Freeman, et al., under the direction of center-ringmaster Wright deliver a hilarious tour-de-force!

Personal Note (minor spoiler warning):

- Absolutely loved the Cornetto Wrapper cameo! Awesomeness x100!

To this very day, even though they're not quite the same, I call our 'Drumsticks' by the Brit name. Partly inspired by the alternate audio track of 'Shaun Of The Dead' with Wright and Pegg discussing this very topic. Funny then - funny now. :-D

- Ditto all the character actors from across the Pegg/Frost/Wright universe!",1414195200,,2858,5.2971175166297115
5570889,4,B00BBTNOE8,"I am a huge fan of the Cornetto trilogy (my favorite being the exquisite ""Hot Fuzz,"") but ""The World's End,"" while a very imaginative and entertaining movie in its own right left me a bit less enthused than the two previous installments. This film centers on five old friends reuniting for an epic pub crawl featuring encounters with everything from high school bullies and old flames to a full scale alien invasion. Simon Pegg as the former leader of the gang who has been destroyed by life has a darker and much more emotional role here, and he turns out a great performance; for my money though Nick Frost takes top honors as the straight guy (a great role reversal from ""Hot Fuzz"" which pleased me immensely.) While Simon is perfectly suited to play a jerk, the supporting cast (many of whom are veterans of ""Hot Fuzz"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"") particularly Martin Freeman and Paddy Considine are equally up to their respective roles.

I liked the thematic similarities between The Network and the NWA (from ""Hot Fuzz"") and the inherent alien evilness of The Network is perfectly encapsulated in Bill Nighy's detached and genuinely creepy dialogue. Pierce Brosnan as a former teacher and alien acolyte is a piece of casting genius, and the scenes in the bar between the protagonists and Brosnan are high points. The conclusion (don't miss the Cornetto reveal...it passes really quickly in this one!) is an interesting post-apocalyptic take on the future that is unpredictable and arresting and allows Frost to really shine.

The film is beautifully made with extraordinary editing of particular note. Edgar Wright is a truly talented filmmaker and ""The World's End"" features a lot of his signature dark humor, though unlike the other two Cornetto films, I felt a bit empty after watching this one. The acting and cast is first rate, the film is gloriously beautiful to watch, and the action sequences are brilliant, but in the end I felt it was perhaps a bit longer than ideal as there were moments I found my mind wandering, something that never once occurred during ""Shaun of the Dead"" or ""Hot Fuzz.""

The DVD has many extras which are all worth checking out, particularly for fans of Wright, Pegg, and Frost. I have no qualms recommending ""The World's End,"" but must honestly say it's my least favorite of the three Cornetto films (but ""Hot Fuzz"" is perpetually in my list of top five favorite films of all time, with ""Shaun of the Dead"" close in trail.) This is a thoughtful if bleaker film than the earlier pictures, but the performances and surprises are excellent and deserving of a look.",1413936000,5,2597,4.792410714285714

The plot is very simple at first. We start off seeing what it was like in high school for a group of friends and how much fun they had. Then we fast forward to modern times where everyone is in a soul draining life....except for one Gary King. Without ruining the movie for you the friends get together, through some manipulation, for a reenactment of their last big night together called the Golden Mile. This epic bar hopping experience has all sorts in store for Gary King and friends and is well worth the watch.

5570925,4,B00BBTNOE8,"""The World's End"" is Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's exercise of their funny and boundless imagination and connection to community.  It is so much fun.  They have taken our quaint ideas of English towns and pubs and ...dragged them and the spirit of Alexandre Dumas  into ""The Beast"" for a truly goofy, damaged, pilgrimage.  It ain't great cinema in one way, but it is broad comedy that successfully takes risks.  What I adore about it is that it comes from such a human place.  Is it making a statement?  Yup.  As much as I enjoy technology, laughing helped me exercise my anxieties of watching people not looking up from their devices and stepping in front of buses about to move, walking through doors opened by kind people and not thanking the consideration, and filming or texting through live performances and not clapping or booing or ANYTHING except watching that tiny screen and/or texting. If I were in group therapy and Mr. King rambled on about the Golden Mile, I might have rolled my eyes and wished he would just run off and go back to drinking.  Pegg and Frost really know how to teach people like me a lesson in vision and compassion and joy with a whole lot of funny panic and running.",1408233600,,1200,4.570093457943925
5570926,3,B00BBTNOE8,"THE WORLD'S END is the final entry in Edgar Wright's Cornetto Trilogy, and it has the same elements which made the previous two enjoyable: sharp dialogue and chemistry among the leads, a sense of fun, a good soundtrack and Edgar Wright's flashy directing style. However, the results this time are a bit more of a mixed bag.

 The story this time is about Gary King (Simon Pegg), who gathers his childhood friends together to finish an epic pub crawl that they failed to complete over 20 years before. Starting off with the positives, the chemistry between the actors is as strong as ever and the trademark British humor is in full force. Simon Pegg clearly had a fun time making this film, and it shows in his performance. There were also some nice twists and turns in the story, although where the story ends up going takes everything off the rails. While the previous two films worked primarily as parody/homage, this one takes it a step further and actually tries to shoehorn a message about letting go of your past and growing up. The others were meta in the way they dealt with their respective genre cliches, but this one felt meta in the sense that the group of people making it were making some sort of statement about their professional lives, at least as far as their collaborations go. Basically, it was their way of letting go of the past and moving forward. This is an admirable sentiment, but it also didn't make for the funniest film at times.

 There was also some issues with character development. Each character had a few different qualities which distinguished themselves from the others (and were different from previous characters they played), but most of the development came from exposition which I felt was rather weak. Finally, the biggest single problem with the film (as with the last one, only worse) was the ending. Here also, it felt like they could have ended the film at a couple of places, but for some reason it just kept going, as if they didn't really know how they wanted to end it. So as not to spoil any surprises, I will stop there. Suffice it to say that a good 10 minutes could have been trimmed to make a more streamlined film.

 Still, as a collaboration between a solid comic team and an excellent director, I enjoyed it. It doesn't quite stand up to the previous two, but those set an impossibly high bar anyway. Overall, if you enjoyed the first two you should definitely check this out. You might not be as impressed, but it's still like having some laughs with old friends.",1408060800,,2524,4.610244988864142

5570938,3,B00BBTNOE8,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have made a number of films together. They claim that this is the third and final part of the cornetto trilogy. This is the story of an epic pub crawl which is supposed to end at a pub called the ""World's End"". ALong the way the middle-aged group discovers that the world is about to be overtaken by aliens. Well it makes a pub-crawl more interesting doesn't it. This characters have more depth than the characters in Hot Fuzz or Paul and the conflicts between the men who haven't seen each other for many years are realistic and well acted. In many ways it's a shame that the secondary plot about aliens intervenes at all. This may well have been better as a film that wasn't a comedy but why would you have SImon Pegg and Nick Frost if this was a serious film. That's the dilemma here. Thefilm is well made and the acting is great but I can't reconcile the primary and secondary plots.

However, with these twits, it's just plain good comedy.  With the exception of the final scene, which drew on way too long, it was a hoot.

Five old friends Gary (Simon Pegg), Andy (Nick Frost), Steven (Paddy Considine), Peter (Eddie Marsan) and Oliver (Martin Freeman) reunite for the first time in twenty years for unfinished business: a twelve-stop pub crawl that was left unfinished when they were eighteen. While enjoying themselves, however, they realize that something is wrong with the townspeople.

The 109-minute comedy is generally amusing, with references to classic invasion-themed sci-fi movies including a parody of the famous test sequence, but the film itself suffers from the weak story, its second half in particular. Why don't they just run away, instead of keeping drinking? And why pub crawl in the first place? I know this is a comedy, but that does not mean the story doesnt have to be convincing.

But perhaps I was disappointed with The Worlds End because I couldn't care less about whether or not those annoying characters survive the night.

Simon Pegg's character Gary is one of the most unlikeable people you will see on screen.  Why this group follow him across the street is beyond me.  He is pathetic.  While the story tries to be funny most of the bits really fall on their face and after a while I started to feel sorry for the characters and the actors who were filimg this.  While it has a great cast, it seems that the story just buries the characters and the actors are not allowed to fully express their life.  Everything is wrapped around Gary.

This felt tired and poorly thought out. I like all the actors they had and the movie in and of itself was not terrible (although Pegg's character was seriously lame in both thought and portrayal) but it felt WAY too much like SotD and the ending lacked any sort of ingenuity or creativity. A lot of potential for very little reward. I seriously DID NOT like the relationship between Pegg's character and Frost's character. In EVERY other movie that they do, they are best friends and to pit them against each other like that, was not cool man, not cool.",1396569600,,703,4.5

It starts as a road trip down (drinking and) memory lane for some high school buddies, seemingly quite ordinary, and then takes a ride off the rails into a kind of sci fi/metaphysical direction. See for yourself. I went to the movies one night to see this on a lark, and after seeing it, decided to buy it for my (limited) collection. The musical score is quite wonderful, I must say, as a musical aficionado.

Rent it and see if it doesn't have appeal. It isn't dull!",1396483200,,623,4.3247863247863245

The last pub on the list is ""the World's End"".  While the interactions between the ""old friends"" varies between amusing and irritating, the movie veers into weirdness when they discover that the population of the entire town has been replaced by robots controlled by aliens in a weird attempt to convince humanity to behave well and be fit to join an interplanetary society of boring conformists.  Definitely the end of the world as we know it.",1396483200,,690,4.677685950413223

5571014,5,B00BBTNOE8,"If you loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" you will want to watch this.  However, ""The World's End"" is a much different movie than those two films.  Indeed, the first 30 minutes or so aren't really as funny as they are painful.  Not David Brent in the BBC version of ""The Office"" painful, either.  Simon Pegg's character, Gary King (or ""Gary the King"") is an obnoxious, unlikeable boor; a manchild stuck 25 years in the past, who has never outgrown who he used to be.  His attempts to round up his estranged mates by any means possible, for a final attempt to finish a legendary pub crawl, are awkward and unfunny.  About 30 minutes into this movie, my wife and I were looking at each other wondering just what kind of movie this was and why we were watching it.

Then, ""From Dusk Till Dawn""-like, the movie completely flips tone and content and goes a totally different direction than you would expect.  The groundwork of making Gary the King so unlikeable is for a reason, and it all pays off later on.  I won't say anything about any of that so as not to ruin the surprise.

This is a funny and very original film, but be forewarned about the first bit of it.  It's at least worth a rent.",1396310400,,1197,4.346846846846847

There's an interesting (and kinda blatant) metaphor traced through most of this, but it seems more like a neat aside to the movie's existing humor.

This movie is funny and action-packed but best of all the characters are likeable, even the defective lead character, Gary King.  Lot's of typical British humor and dialogue and great special effects too.

5571072,4,B00BBTNOE8,"While sharing thematic and stylistic similarities with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, this is somewhat different in tone to those two films, particularly in the role reversal for Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Pegg is something of an (well, let's call it an annoying character) here, sometimes to the point of actually annoying the viewer and Frost is the staid, sensible one (at least at first). It doesn't always work, but for the most part it's good.
It does a great job though of ramping up the story with fun references back to the other two films and also some references to the directors 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World', particularly in the wonderfully staged fight scenes. The special effects are a lot of fun, the supporting cast are great (especially Martin Freeman) and this is just a fun, great film. I wasn't enamored by the ending, but that's personal preference, some may like it better than I did.
Still, it's definitely a film that I'd watch again at some point. I liked it a lot.",1393286400,,992,4.610169491525424

There is no way this movie should get a bad review. Great cast, great direction and there is just nonstop laughter all throughout the movie. It works on so many levels of funny. Although this is not as great as the other two, it's still full of heart and rich story like in the previous entries of the Three Flavours of Cornetto. Twists and one of the best fight scenes you'll ever see come out of a 2013 movie release. And what is a Wright movie without the little signs and omens that lead the film.",1393286400,,632,4.275

5571078,4,B00BBTNOE8,"Simon Pegg calls Gary King his favorite character to have played in flicks, never mind that Gary King is obnoxious and oblivious and obviously such a self-destructive git. Gary is the overwhelming reason I at first couldn't get as into THE WORLD'S END, a film I'd been anticipating for years but then felt let down by. But then I saw it again and it's when I came around. The beauty of Pegg and Wright's movies are that they get even better with repeated viewings. Second spin around, you notice a sly reference that slipped past you the first time or a new bit of gag or, as in my case, a new perspective on Gary King. The first time, I was so annoyed by how annoying he was that it totally skipped me that that was the point of the movie. Gary defines a huge swath of the ""human"" spectrum. He's not perfect. He's human and deeply flawed, one moment so unsympathetic, the next pathetically vulnerable. And then I related to him. Anyway, THE WORLD'S END may be my least favorite of the bunch but it's an appropriate enough capstone to the Blood & Ice Cream trilogy. Or The Three Flavours of Cornetto trilogy, whichever fits ya.

To paraphrase Rosamund Pike in the bonus features, ""There's always that one bloke in the group who never grew up. And if you can't figure out who that is in your group, then odds are it's you."" For Gary King, it was never so good as when he was lording it in his high school years back in good ol' Newton Haven. I guess some blokes peak way too soon. Gary's best night happened twenty years ago - June 22, 1990, it was - when he and his four best mates celebrated the final day of school by attempting that same evening to conquer the Golden Mile, a stretch of twelve pubs of which terminus is The World's End. Alas, the lads never quite made it, and the sun hasn't shined on Gary's head since.

From early moments on, we're onto Gary King; we know what he's about. Twenty years later, one useless life lived later, he aims to recreate that epic pub crawl. Ah, but can he convince his old mates to go along with his mad bid at reclaiming youth?

Well, yes, he does convince his old mates and so here they are, the five of the lot, motoring back to their sleepy hometown, Newton Haven. And maybe that's one of the themes of this movie - that one should never really go home again, that home, in fact, is a terrifying place. ""We're just five friends, on a night out, having a good time,"" remarks Gary King to his four cronies, and who are they tryin' to kid? Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, co-writers of this thing, strive to drive that message home with a generous dab of awkward reunions, blue-inked robots, and a rather polite alien invasion.

Plonk Pegg, Wright, and Nick Frost together in the same room, and genre cinema should just bend over for another bout of damn clever skewering. THE WORLD'S END sets you up for a wild blend of peril and British whimsy. It treats you to Wright's signature quick-cut edits, a panoply of daft blue-collar witticisms, and to folks clumsily hurdling fences. But, as with SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, it's the unexpected bits of introspection and heartfelt emotional arcs that will resonate. It's a fabulous cast comprised of, naturally, Pegg and Nick Frost (playing the straight man, for a change), but also of Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan, Rosamund Pike, and Pierce Brosnan. Watch them as they rage against conformity and the steady job and the pursuit of betterment, as they wear immaturity like a badge of honor and flaunt it as if it were humanity's last saving grace. And, also, watch them kick massive robot butt! It's Pegg & Wright's subversive take on the sci-fi genre.

And, no worries, there is a Cornetto reference. You just may have to wait a while.

5571099,3,B00BBTNOE8,"The World's End is the third movie in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy that began with Shaun of the Dead and continued with Hot Fuzz. The movies share the same director, writers, and stars but not the same narrative or characters. Thematically, they share the modern man's problem of growing up in a world that doesn't require him to mature.

In this film, Gary King (Simon Pegg) gets his friends back together to re-do a home-town pub crawl that they had attempted back in school. Gary is a bit of a wreck and a bit of a ""lad"" as they say in England. He likes to have a good time (mostly drink too much) and doesn't really care about other people so much. He likes to argue and will keep arguing until he wins, usually by wearing out the patience of the other person. He's trapped in adolescence, almost as if the pub crawl was his gateway out of childishness and he never made it through. The other guys have moved on to middle-class white-collar jobs and lives.

Going back to their home town, the lads discover things still look the same (all twelve pubs are still there) but things have changed. The first pub has been taken over by a larger company that owns a lot of ""local"" pubs which furnished the pubs the same inside. The pubs still have the local name and maybe the same staff but they offer pre-fab menus and national-brand lagers, not local dishes and ales from nearby breweries (living in England, I can verify this phenomena). The lads discuss the old times and how things have changed and how they've moved on. The movie is a fairly interesting character driven comedy to this point.

Then the big reveal happens. If you don't want to be spoiled (which may have already happened if you've seen trailers or reviews or, indeed, already watched the film), stop reading now. The twist is that the townspeople have been replaced with robotic versions of themselves. The lads find out in one of the pub's toilets where a big fight breaks out between them and some local lads. The robots' injuries reveal their true nature. They leak blue oil when they are damaged. Almost the whole town has been taken over by a larger organization with presumably nefarious plans. Gary convinces the guys they have to complete the pub crawl so as not to draw attention to themselves, thus allowing them to escape at the end of the night. His arguing skills win the day and they try to make it through the pubs and the night without too much bloodshed or oilshed.

Thematically this is a wonderful idea but the execution doesn't quite work. In the toilet fight, all of the sudden, in addition to robot locals, viewers have to buy into these middle-aged white-collar guys having amazing fighting skills. A bit too much comes out of left field at the same time. I found the rest of the film not as convincing or interesting as the beginning of the film, even though plenty of interesting things happen along the way. And it was still funny to the end, just not as strong as the other two films in the trilogy.

Parental advisory: Constant drinking (along with some driving); swearing; violent fights but the robots don't have gory damage done to them (though one does walk around with the top half of his head missing, which is played for laughs rather than horror); some conversations about sex and an extended scene of the lads making out with late-teen/early-twenties girls.",1392249600,2,3372,4.603993344425957

No doubt you'll find 'The World's End' fresher and funnier if you haven't seen the others; for fans, though, the gags-- as well as the formula-- are familiar and at times come across as somewhat, ahem, robotic.

5571126,4,B00BBTNOE8,"Like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz before it, The World's End defies easy categorization.  Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg deftly weave themes of  coming of age (and refusing to come of age), fear of change, conformity, the expectations of ""grown-up"" society, and group intellect/behavior versus individual behavior into this sci-fi ""invasion of the robot pod people"" adventure flick.  The World's End manages to be self-referential enough (including, of course, the Cornetto) to please devotees of Shaun and Fuzz without bogging down in in-jokes and risking losing viewers who might be new to the Three Flavours.  It also sets a different heading than the first two, being considerably less carefree and delving into some deeper territory.  This is not to say Wright and Pegg have lost their senses of humor - laughs abound in this movie, some of them coming from surprising places. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg play off of each other brilliantly yet again, and have easily switched roles here, trading who is the ""responsible"" one and who is the one clinging to an unrealistic ideal.  Rosamund Pike, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, and Eddie Marsan each give excellent turns as the old friends dragged along on Gary King's desperate attempt to relive the greatest night of his life.",1391385600,,1279,5.037914691943128

The story revolves around Simon pegg's character, the leader of a small high school group of guys who is stuck in the past. They tried to complete the ""golden mile,"" drinking at 12 different pubs that finishes at a bar name the world's end. They didn't make it all the way, so pegg and company decide to give it one more try. But there is a problem, the entire town has been taken over by ""blanks"". I won't get into specific, but it is extremely bizarre.

There are very few funny segments in the movie, which should be the main draw. Consistency was also lacking as the characters are totally wasted one minute, as they should be, and fighting like a martial artist the next.

Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg got more ambitious with each movie and the Worlds End really is a great culmination to the trilogy. Its a pub crawl, its a sci fi spoof, a bromance and a coming-of-age extravaganza all mixed up into one, brilliantly done.

Wright and Co. do a tremendous job to stretch out and break barriers as the narrative is something most people are not used to, plus the genre mashup asks a lot from the viewer, but the result is rewarding and very, very clever (maybe way to clever for many) and very funny.

A lot of people are getting frustrated comparing this movie to the previous two, which is the biggest mistake you could make, the central theme (besides the cornetto ice cream) to all three movies is friendship and the strange turns friendships take.

If you are expecting Shaun of the Dead II or a zombie movie look elsewhere if you want some sci-fi-meets-kung-fu-breakfast-club-20-years-later movie then this is for you, as The Worlds End has more in common with Cabin in the Woods or Scott Pilgrim than with Shaun of Hot Fuzz, at least story wise.",1390176000,,1241,4.576576576576577

The 'fight' scene ripped right out of every sci-fi movie since the Matrix and lacklustre cinematography (again compared to previous two..) we're additional disappointments.

Have they gotten too big for their boots? Have they lost the 'indie' charm found in the other 'Cornetto Series' films... who knows but I certainly feel that the guts brought from the 'Spaced' series to movie making has definitely got lost somewhere... shame!

5571194,4,B00BBTNOE8,"The Worlds End is the final film in the so called Cornetto Trilogy, which began with the brilliantly funny zombie spoof Shaun Of The Dead, hit a small bump with the amusing yet unbalanced action comedy Hot Fuzz, and now culminates symbolically with a laugh-filled look at the apocalypse.

Gary King (Simon Pegg) is a peaked-in-highschool loser. He is a drug addict and an alcoholic, he cant hold a steady job, and he has never moved past what he considers to be the greatest night of his life. Twenty-three years ago he and his four best friends attempted to tackle the legendary Golden Mile, a pub-crawl through the twelve pubs in their hometown with a pint per pub. They didn't quite make it to the end and though Gary remembers the night fondly, he has always secretly wished they had made it to the final pub, The Worlds End. He figures its time he and his friends finish what they started.

Off Gary goes on a Blues Brothers-ish quest to get the band back together. One by one he rounds up his high school chums and bullies, cons, and pouts them into coming along with him one last time. Though his friends have all moved on and have successful lives and relationships of their own, they agree to one last hurrah and go back home to again attempt The Golden Mile.

The village of Newtown Haven isn't quite as they remember it. Most of the pubs have been Starbucked and made part of a larger chain with no personality of their own, and no one in town seems to remember them, even at their old hangouts. Not only that, but the townsfolk seem oddly reserved and aloof, with none of the small town character they remember from long ago. Is it just that the five friends have changed and grown or is something more sinister going on?

That is as far I can take you without getting into spoiler territory, but one thing I can tell you, this is a worthy final chapter to the Cornetto films. Director Edgar Wright and screenplay co-writer Pegg have truly outdone themselves with this film. The five grown friends as played by Martin Freeman, Paddy Consindine, and Eddie Marsan are fully realized individuals with well fleshed out personalities and real chemistry together. Pegg and trilogy co-star Nick Frost play completely against type here, with Pegg playing the loathsome loser in King and Frost playing the teetotaling Andy. The rest of the cast is stellar and there is not a single lackluster performance in the entire film. The movie deals equally well with both slapstick comedy and the deeper and darker issues of addiction and mental illness. You can tell that a great deal of care and effort went into making this movie and that it was also a labor of love for all involved. There are so many freeze frame gags that the movie holds up well even after multiple viewings. This being said, there is one minor complaint that continues to bother many moviegoers.

The ending of the film is very odd in tone and execution. It doesnt feel connected to the rest of the film and it knocks you out of the world it has spent the rest of the movie so carefully constructing. While that may have been the intent of the filmmakers as a metaphor, it is a bit off putting and just feels out of place in this movie. Fans of the rest of the series may be willing to take this in stride, but newcomers may be hard pressed to move on to the other two films.

All that aside, The Worlds End is a clever film with plenty of fan service connecting it to the other two movies in the series and is good enough by itself to make the series some new fans. If Wright and Pegg decide to keep going and make another Cornetto film then I, for one, will be among the first in line.",1389744000,,3657,4.442622950819672

5571206,3,B00BBTNOE8,"There is something odd about The World's End, the third film in the cornetto trilogy by actors Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and director Edgar Wright.  Approximately mid-way, the tone shifts abruptly and either the viewer is either willing to go along for the ride, or they're not.  The first half of the film is more of a character study in which a group of friends are reunited to recreate a ""pub crawl"", i.e., visiting twelve pubs in one night.  Pegg's performance during this part is good, but his character is completely unlikable... and a bit of a jerk.  Frost was equally good, perhaps better, and I would have preferred he had more dialogue during the first hour.  The foley sounds and quick editing are irritating and instead of being cinematic, feels more like I'm watching a commercial for coffee or a sports drink.

The second half of the movie is a science-fiction comedy which turns tail on the first half of the film.  The action scenes are filmed rather well, the movements are clear and it is easy to distinguish exactly what is happening during a fight.  The ending was weak, to me, and despondent.

From experience, I know the cornetto films improve on re-watch, however after my initial viewing I cannot go above three stars.  Watchable, but disappointing.",1389571200,,1271,4.762557077625571

*******************************************************************************
At first I was greatly disappointed with the denouement of this film.  I went to bed after watching this film thinking the denouement was really stupid.  Upon further reflection I thought it was a nightmare ending befitting a true horror story.  But the TRUE horror story was not about anything otherworldly per se.  It was about a true sociopath.

This sociopath  is interested in connections with humans only in so far as they serve his pursuit of his own hedonistic goals.  This sociopath has no problems lieing to people who were his lifelong friends (all friendships he ruined with his actions), manipulating them or stealing their resources, including their identities. The friend who is painted as the wisest actually says this right out to the sociopath fairly early on in the film.  The sociopath's belief in his own agenda is so ego driven that he thinks everything he does is right.  He never thinks any of his actions are wrong even when they endanger others.  He takes one action in the film that could be seen as truly altruistic, and he is quick to call it such. But it is not altruistic at all.  It completely fits with his agenda and that is the only reason he takes it.

This sociopath feels he is the ""victim"" of a world that is not as fun or hip or smart as he is and his victimhood entitles him to engage in behavior that puts others in harm's way.  He is so married to the idea that his way is the best way that when he is offered true enlightement, not just for himself but for the entire human race, he refuses it.  His friends refuse it too right along with him but only because they are drunk off their asses.  When the world of humans is turned totally upside down into a place where the human population is less civilized, less comfortable and less enlightened than it ever has been in the modern era,  this sociopath finally gets to play the hero in his own story.  And only then but befriending non-humans and using them to terrorize other humans (which is the last shot of the film).  A true nightmare horror story indeed.",1389484800,,2315,4.674074074074074

5571213,2,B00BBTNOE8,"for me, didn't understand why lead suddenly re-appeared in his friends lives demanding a pub crawl. his excuse of his mom having died was unbelievable even before story revealed he was lying. the writers showed the characters knew one another and had a relationship but didn't present enough information initially for the audience to attach to the spastic lead character, and as he was wrangling the other characters, didn't understand what was motivating him or them. in real life does an old school mate appear after what, 20 years, and you drop your life for a weekend to accomodate him. what about your children? previous engagements? blowing him off because he's done you wrong in the past? any of those reactions would've been more believable than 4 middle age guys allowing themselves to be talked into a pub crawl they didn't want. movie didn't suck, actors are outstanding, but the writers needed to give audience more info about lead so we could buy into why his four former mates would go along, albeit grudgingly. Simon Pegg's character was hyper and irresponsible and his friends were initially stodgily middle age and non-whimsical (with nary a twinkle in their eye) and the pairing of the two opposites, without explaining to the audience what motivated the sides, left me outside the story. remember Shaun of the Dead, when Simon Pegg's roommates disliked each other, and the audience liked the Nick character, but the story showed why he was unappealing to the other roommate (Nick's character was an unmotivated slob), well that information made sense to the audience and let us into the story: we understood the dynamic between the 3 roommates. In this film, the dynamic between the 5 characters wasn't explained early enough in the film for us to understand why 4 seemingly uber responsible men would indulge an old school mate they'd not seen in decades. 2 and a half stars, for solid acting and great comedic timing: these actors are at the top of their game - story approach needed a rethink, is all.

Final thoughts: these guys were unbelievably outstanding fighters for average middle age men. after hours guzzling beer had no problem fighting off hordes of invaders. I believe the Simon Pegg character smoked and though he had to run he never wheezed. Also, the Nick Frost character, who is large, was a fantastic fighter and ran for blocks, all without getting winded. Not believable that middle age men who dressed like accountants and had sedentary jobs, drinking lots and lots and lots of beer (only one guy had to go to the bathroom once as a consequence of all that fluid, again not believable - middle age people's bladders are not the bladders of 20 year olds), with shots too, smoked, and overweight, were fantastic fighting machines and up to the physical challenge as presented in the story.",1389398400,,2828,4.879417879417879

Being in my 40s myself, I can relate to such material and the first 2/3 of this movie deals with how some embrace, some adapt and some rebel with that they consider ""the best times of their lives.""  And, they do a fantastic job of it and I wanted more, but the last 1/3 takes a total 180 from the current direction of the first 2/3 and while fun I felt it just didn't match nor was necessary.

The plot of the movie is about five guys who reunite to complete a task from their senior year of high school to visit(and drink) from the town eleven bars in one day.  This movie starts out great with the back story of each person and what they are doing in the present(there is another surprise but watch the movie to find out).  The World's end is very entertaining and for a comedy there is plenty of action.  If you watched Edgar Wright previous movies to the series  Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz  than you will like World's End.  The acting was great the cast had great chemistry and it shows throughout the film.

I loved Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  But his movie just does not work.

First, the two main characters of all 3 films switch roles.  Simon Pegg is now the reckless ""loser"" while his counterpart is the more responsible fellow.  The switch does NOT work.  You really end up not liking any of the characters really.  Everyone is mostly just a dickish a-hole and not in a funny way.

The movie drags on as well and the ending seems ludicrous just to make up for the rest of the kind of boring movie.

Again, big disappointment.",1388880000,,565,4.254716981132075

5571264,5,B00BBTNOE8,"The World's End was probably the most interesting case of ""multiple viewing"" appreciation I have had since watching Shawn of the Dead.  I found myself apologizing for both movies to friends and family, in fact, I have had to apologize for Hot Fuzz too, so I've actually been forced to apologize after the first viewing for all of Pegg's movies as his humor was and continues to be too different from contemporary comedic norms. Nevertheless, both Shawn of the Dead and now The World's End have become, at the present time, my favorite movies to watch on a regular basis. I have the HD version of Shawn of the Dead for viewing at home, and even went to the extraordinary length of putting the World's End in my iPhone's limited memory. This is the ONLY movie on my iPhone's memory, meaning this is the ONLY movie I can watch anywhere, anytime... needless to say I am a fan in the true original fanatical meaning of the word.

The reason I have found Pegg's movies, in particular The World's End, compelling on an ongoing basis, is a potent mix of nostalgia (I am a British immigrant), Pegg's innovative ""ultra-realism""-based comedic method (that represents a revolutionary departure from modern Hollywood comedic norms), and a profound and underappreciated deeper philosophical message, which I would argue parallels, to a significant degree, Siduri's ancient ""Carpe Diem"" philosophies, on life and the purpose of life.

Siduri is a female divinity in the Epic of Gilgamesh associated with wisdom, fermentation and merrymaking. In the Old Babylonian version of the Epic, she attempts to dissuade Gilgamesh in his quest for immortality, urging him to be content with the simple pleasures of life: ""Gilgamesh, whither are you wandering? Life, which you look for, you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his share, and life withheld in their own hands. Gilgamesh, fill your belly. Day and night make merry. Let days be full of joy, dance and make music day and night. And wear fresh clothes. And wash your head and bathe. Look at the child that is holding your hand, and let your wife delight in your embrace. These things alone are the concern of men.""
Siduri's ancient advice from the Epic of Gilgamesh

At Worlds End is the hilarious third movie in what has been dubbed the ""cornetto"" trilogy, and it is a very funny, and sometimes emotional film.

""Hot Fuzz"" is a better Michael Bay/Keanu Reeves/Bruce Willis popcorn-action flick than any of those guys have made in decades, in addition to being so funny that it sometimes leaves me breathless (if it makes sense, the movie is sometimes so brilliant that I forget to laugh.  Instead, I stare in open-mouthed amazement).  ""The World's End"" has a high bar to clear, but it does so easily.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver excellent performances that reverse their usual dynamic, but the real takeaway from this movie is just what an outstanding director Edgar Wright has become.  The action sequences in the movie are fluidly shot and well-planned and executed.  Many a big-name ""action"" director could stand a day or two observing at Edgar Wright's feet.  Like the previous volumes in the trilogy, ""The World's End"" delivers laughs, a solid script, an homage/appreciation of genre that moves far beyond parody, and some intriguing ideas.

Twenty-some years later, he tries to reunite the five -- none of whom he's seen in years -- and make another try at it, this time to reach the twelfth pub, ""The World's End.""

But things get weird. Really, really weird. The thing is, I can't tell you too much without spoiling something. But I can say without excessive spoilage that they quickly realize that something is not right in their town, or in the pubs they are crawling. Something epically not right. Something that should not be.

This movie started off ok as it showed their past.. but Pegg's character became so unlikable that I started to lose interest. The movie then went off on a scifi tangent which I struggled to enjoy... Then something happened. In the World's End Pub we realize why Pegg's character is the way he is.. there was a moment when everything (outside of the scifi stuff) came together. I felt for the character and I think we could all relate to his pain..

.. and then the movie pretty much went down the toilet with the ending being truly stupid.

I also love Spaced and Paul as well, I personally think that Simon Pegg & Nick Frost kill as a comedic duo.  So when it came to this latest work by Edgar Wright I was ready for both disaster and epicness.  What I got was a mix of both.
  I wasn't able to view this film in theaters because of it's restricted release but once I managed to view it with a friend, we had the best laughs in a long time.  This movie is a great addition to any collection whether you like the Cornetto trilogy or are new to their comedy.  This film ties in comedy, great fight scenes, wonderful science fiction that appears to fly off to you like Dr. Who and a rather pulling story that draws you into the plot.
  A lot of people have been giving this movie lower scores or ratings than it deserves because well sadly, the trilogy is over... and people don't want their favorite stories to end.

I think Simon Pegg's character was unlikable to a fault; without any redeeming qualities, his character seemed annoying and I was unable to invest myself in his character, and subsequently the others.

The only thing you need to know to judge TWE as opposed to the first two brilliant comedies is this: In Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the characters LIKE cornettos.  In TWE, there is only one reference, near the end a wrapper drifts by while the Andy character (Nick Frost) says something to the effect ""I can't even think of one (junk food) that I miss"" WHAT? It'd be like having a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie where they say ""You know, pizza sucks, and we were stupid to ever eat it"" and the TMNT movies aren't even known as ""The Pizza Trilogy""

5571354,5,B00BBTNOE8,"Very enjoyable film which is almost two films in one - one is about old friends reuniting after many years on the coerced behest of ne-er-do-well friend of theirs to complete a pub crawl they never finished when they were young and the other is a sci-fi movie which involves saving the world from well-meaning but very misguided aliens.

The film does a great job in telling a story about getting older, accepting responsibility, and dealing with an alien invasion which is for our own good. There are some genuine touching moments in the movie with the characters coming to terms with their past and their present as they destroy robot replicants of the aforementioned alien invasion.

Particularly good is the role reversal with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Usually Frost plays the couldn't-care-less loser character whom Pegg's character has to help and defend. In this film Pegg is brilliant as the loose cannon figure of the group who never wanted to grow up while Frost is the responsible one and has to knock sense into Pegg's character. He takes the lead of the group several times when Pegg cannot be trusted but he doesn't become a boring straight man character. He has some very funny moments in the film.

World's End is a very funny fun film that can also be bittersweet at times. Well worth a watch and definitely worth seeing with friends and beer.",1387411200,,1361,4.734177215189874

A spiritual successor of sorts, The World's End is funny, manic and sincere in many of the same ways as Shaun of the Dead, but to far lesser degrees. It stretches for Shaun's emotional depth, but a thin, superficial set of characters can't match it. Its early action scenes are wild and entertaining, so excellent that I simply couldn't wait for the next variation, but that goodwill is quickly wasted when subsequent brawls merely rinse and repeat. Even Pegg's irreverent leading role, often relied upon to carry an iffy scene, doesn't carry the same weight he did in Hot Fuzz or SotD. In fact, in many ways he's repellent, even when a shining moment of truth seems poised to descend upon him against his will. Ultimately we're all rooting for him, but it's just by proxy and not because we genuinely want to see him triumphant. The first two acts are solid, if not excellent, but the plot's resolution rings hollow and its follow-through seems more like a dream sequence punk-out than an honest farewell.

Ignore those handing out negative votes to honest reviews. If this is suppose to be a comedy it fails, and it isn't nearly as good as any of the Dr. Who episodes that some compare it with.  I would suggest those I list below as they are far funnier and/or have better drama, and they won't leave you wondering why you spent the time watching them.

There is a lot of good dialogue and action, but it takes on a more serious tone which turns it from a comedy to a personal drama and then goes back to comedy and action.  I don't think it quite makes it back all the way.

The plot moderately suggests a video game-like design and to a degree, it turns into one as they find trouble along the way. Was it funny? On and off laughs but nothing gut bending. Mostly I could say that it left a lasting smile on my face after watching it. The cast was was fun, energetic and entertaining.

There were a few moments when something interesting happened, and then it got all Douglas Adams but more boring at the end. I watched it because Simon Pegg is a genius.

There were 3 things that I have to nitpick, as they interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.
1. For aliens with the technological ability to cross interstellar space and create amazing, perfectly normal looking and functional androids, their heads (and arms) came off very, very easily.
2. The empty heads stretch the boundaries of scientific plausibility.  If there is no means of focusing the light coming in through the eyes, vision should be impossible.  Same goes for hearing.  And what mechanism inside their empty heads allowed their eyes and mouths to glow on demand?
3. Simon Pegg and friends are supposed to be ordinary guys.  Yet they fought like they've been taking martial arts lessons all their life.",1386115200,4,906,4.85064935064935

5571431,5,B00BBTNOE8,"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it! If you like British humor, if you liked Pegg's other two movies, then you'll likely enjoy this film, as well.

5571444,5,B00BBTNOE8,This is one of the smartest movies of 2013.  What makes this the best is how Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright can take such a simple theme like common human failure and make it so much deeper.  There is a whole other level to this film other than some old friends reliving their youth and the good old days.  This film is about how we can't let our failures and faults be the only definition of our lives.

Some stupid scifi film  stuff or about something at the end?? Non of the consistently funny and non stop humor that Pegg and Frost  left you on the floor rolling till you couldn't breath anymore, was not found here. It was rambling and seemed to have no direction. The pub scenes were yawners, oh bring back teh Winchester. Repetitive jokes about marmalade sandwiches and other boyish ribaldry were  stupid, thas all. I hope this is the worlds end for such ""Blood and Choclate"" trilogys and Pegg can get back to being the funny man he is. Not the looser the movie tried to theme in badly.

That as much as we love him or her, we feel so very sorry for them, BECAUSE  they have never changed... We've grown up but they haven't.

They meet people they knew that don't remember them. They see a bully who is now kind and polite. Women want them, who would have never looked twice before.

5571466,5,B00BBTNOE8,"The World's End: written by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg; directed by Edgar Wright; starring Simon Pegg (Gary King), Nick Frost (Andy Knightley), Martin Freeman (Oliver Chamberlain), Paddy Considine (Steven Prince), Eddie Marsan (Peter Page), Pierce Brosnan (Guy Shephard), and Rosamund Pike (Sam Chamberlain) (2013): The third film in the Cornetto Trilogy (so named for the British ice-cream treat that appears in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and this film) is a lot of serious fun.

40-year-old alcoholic Gary King's greatest life moment was the night in June 1990 when he and his four best friends attempted the Golden Mile, a 12-pub pub crawl in their quaint English home town. Now, 23 years later, Gary wants to get the band back together so as to actually finish the crawl, which ended at pub 9. But he's a genuine toxic screw-up whose friends haven't talked to him in years. And he lives entirely in the past, still listening to the music and wearing the clothes of 1990. He's frozen in time, a Goth time traveller still decked out in dyed-black hair and a Sisters of Mercy t-shirt.

But primarily through skullduggery and guilt-tripping, he gets the crawl going. And then things go bad. Science fictiony bad. And it ends up looking like the fate of the Earth will rest on Gary's drunken shoulders, and the shoulders of his friends. All this in a small town whose main claim to fame, as a giant road sign tells us, is that it's the site of England's first roundabout (in 1909!).

The science fiction in The World's End holds up better here, in a comedy, than it does in pretty much all the 'serious' releases of the summer. It's a droll homage to science fiction British (Village of the Damned, Quatermass, and any number of Doctor Who episodes) and American (most pointedly the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but also The Day the Earth Stood Still, classic and remake). And the movie, while making something of a serious point about addiction and man-children, doesn't necessarily suggest any personal growth by the end of the picture. Or the hope of it.

As in other projects from Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost, The World's End teems with pop-culture riffs and references, though here they're as much to the music of 1990 as they are to science fiction and comic books. It's a great, fun piece of work, and maybe the most consistent in tone of the films in the trilogy.",1385424000,,2392,4.729016786570743

It may have fewer out-and-out laughs than the others because this movie is deliberately more serious, less goofy (though still awfully funny), with characters that seem like actual people.  It's not Shaun & Fuzz, but it isn't supposed to be.  It's the best acting that Simon Pegg has done, even though his character is abrasive and on a downhill slide and on a search for redemption.  You can't really expect them to keep doing the exact same shtick over and over now that they've become adults.  (I mean, Nick Frost has to be sick of having to play slobs.  I expect he's actually more like the character in this film.)  The World's End still has the sweetness of the other films in the trilogy, even if there is more conflict between the characters.  Pegg & Frost are still soulmates, even if they're not so sure they like each other anymore.  Aliens aside, the movie is more realistic than the others, and this may be part of the reason it's disappointing to some people.  But it's the reason that I cared more about it.  I give them so much credit for taking risks.  Not that I don't still love Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  I just love this one more.

5571492,5,B00BBTNOE8,"The World's End is easily the best comedy I have ever seen. When five friends get back together after twenty years apart, they return to their hometown of Newton Haven to do The Golden Mile; 12 pubs, 60 pints. But when they return, they begin to realize changes, and soon discover that their home has become something else, and that the people they once knew are something else as well...

Edgar Wright has truly crafted the greatest comedic trilogy on the planet with the Cornetto films. First, we got Shaun of the Dead; a romantic comedy with gory zombie violence. Then, we had a buddy cop comedy with Michael Bay-esque action sequences. Now, we have The World's End; a classical alien invasion movie, with a comedic King Arthur at the center. But, in comparison to the first two, I wouldn't say World's End is better or worse because, it is the end. The World's End, like Wright said, ""Is a thematic wrap-up."" We've followed these style of characters and the comedic rolls through the years, and we get to see them off in a blaze of glory (literally). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, though, were easily at their best, with Frost sometimes stealing the show in this installment. The soundtrack was fun, really helping fill the screen with intensity and energy. Surprisingly, the action sequences are among the best I've seen for any movie, with stunts coordinated by Brad Allen from Jackie Chan's martial arts team. Even the visual effects were top-notch, especially when we get to see the robots as robots.

In the end, The World's End really is the perfect send-off for fans and watchers of the Cornetto trilogy. And for those just jumping into The World's End, I suggest watching the first two beforehand because, that way, you can appreciate this one more (if you like Wright's style of dry, witty humor). Honestly, I've never felt better after leaving a movie at the theater; The World's End really shows the importance of friendship, and why we love movies in the first place.

The other four--Andy, Peter, Oliver, and Steven--have moved on with their lives.  Grown up.  But not Gary.  And he manages to convince the guys to join him.  Except their hometown has changed.  No one seems to recognize them.  Is it that their epic night on the Golden Mile wasn't as epic as Gary believes? Or have the citizens of the town been replaced by robots filled with blue stuff?

Definitely robots filled with blue stuff.

Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have created a brilliant trilogy of films.  THE WORLD'S END is a marvelous finale.  As with SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, the real treat here is the chemistry between the cast: Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, and Eddie Marsan.  Rosamund Pike gets a nice supporting turn (she's so hit-and-miss, it hurts, because when she's good, she's great), and so does Pierce Brosnan (and yes, Bill Nighy is in there again...just wait for it).  Wright and Pegg's script doesn't necessarily raise the bar, though it at least meets the standards set by their two previous films.  Wright is making a stand as one of the more discernible directors of modern times; even his bit in GRINDHOUSE stood out from the rest of the pack.  And let's not overlook the effects; just as with SHAUN and FUZZ, WORLD'S END manages to look just as good as the films it's paying homage to.

Ultimately, THE WORLD'S END comes off as a fitting cap to this trilogy.  I highly doubt this will be the end of the collaborations; after all, these guys clearly all have too much fun working together.  So let's raise a pint to the films that have been, and the films that will be.  THE WORLD'S END isn't the end of the world; though if the apocalypse was this hilarious, I might be willing to sit through it.",1384819200,4,1997,4.547752808988764

The effects and action scenes were interesting and exciting, although not particularly diverse.  The one liner's were strong and there were some great exchanges.  However, in my opinion this is the weakest movie of the trilogy.  By the time the boys reach their 7th pub, the plot is starting to grow a little repetitive.

The main villians were ""robots""  with heads that pop off with a cartoonish slight twist and spill blue ink type blood (to avoid an R rating I suppose ) rather than red blodded  zombies made the movie quite unworkable. Definitely don't buy this for more than $5 !!",1384560000,4,479,4.241758241758242
5571507,4,B00BBTNOE8,"I was so looking forward to this movie when it was released in theaters and was very disappointed when it did not come to a theater near me. It finally came out to buy (but not rent) so I took a risk and bought it on Amazon. This is not something I normally do but because of the strength of the previous Simon Pegg, Nick Frost movies I figured it would be a good purchase. I was not disappointed.

This movie like the previous Hot Fuzz has more depth to the comedy than what appears on the surface. American movie makers could learn something from these movies, Comedies do not need to be vapid stories full of silly gags and pushing romance at every turn. Comedies can sometimes be funny and have strong themes, it is a crazy concept, I know. You have the main character stuck in the past of the good old days and rounds up his old school friends who have all transitioned into a normal life.

There is something so annoying about Gary King but he has this charisma where I felt compelled to follow him just like his old school chums. He lies, cheats and has a very selective memory and yet somehow his friends still fall in line. Nick Frost did an excellent job as the estranged friend who provides a voice of reason and rage to the movie. The characters are so much fun as they get inebriated through the night and then things get weird. Robots Things who don't like to be called Robots have taken over the town which is one of the strong themes of the movie. As we progress as a society with our reliance on technology we start to homogenize as a society and lose some sense of personal independence. We become slaves to society, more and more like robots. You have Gary King who represents the exact opposite of that, even though his life sucks he still feels unique and his own person.

The movie comes to an interesting end. Its not quite the turn of event of Hot Fuzz but it is quite unique and matches the tone of the underlying theme. The ending is probably the weakest part of the movie but I felt it did work.

I loved this movie. Warning though, there is _a lot_ of language in this movie. Some science fiction violence but the language might be a concern to some people. If you liked the previous movies, youll like this one. In the end I do not regret my purchase and fully plan on watching this again.

He is obnoxious, drives the same car he did in high school, and dresses in the same clothes too.

The middle is when this flick turns into bad Sci-Fi. Here is where a smart director would have tied all the strange events into a clever metaphor against Alcoholism. Instead, there are no surprises. No cool underlying themes or morals to the story. This is why this movie fails. The main character's alcoholism is too sad to be funny, the plot unravels in a way that's too formulaic to be taken seriously, and the Sci-Fi is so boring that it's Z-grade.

5571510,5,B00BBTNOE8,"Perhaps it's the fact that all the principle actors who keep reappearing in Edgar Wright's films but Simon Pegg himself (and Bill Nighy, of course) are within three years of my age that draws me so deeply into his work, but by the time news even started appearing about <i>The World's End</i> I had already built up more anticipation for the final installment of the ""Blood And Ice Cream Trilogy"" (my personal favorite of the several nicknames) than anything else in a life of movie-loving. And more importantly, I was not only not disappointed, I was absolutely blown away by its marvelous ingenuity and brilliant nuances. This is definitely Wright's masterpiece. I'll go so far as to compare it to that <i>other</i> Great Film that happens to be a screwball comedy about the end of the world, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>. If this movie is a sign of its director's real potential, we have some wonderful stuff to look forward to, and even if it remains the crowning achievement of his career it still marks Wright as one of the elite in his field.

This is a work on an entirely different level from its predecessors, <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> and <i>Hot Fuzz</i>, and as much as I love those two movies, it seems almost a shame for <i>The World's End</i> to be lumped in with them. It's a far deeper story with far deeper, more complex characters and an interlocking complex of themes about things that actually <i>matter</i>. It's about the conflict between civilization and freedom, youth and maturity, realism and wishful thinking, friendship and codependency, and any number of other dichotomies, and manages to explore all these relationships in meaningful ways without actually answering <i>any</i> of them, much less getting preachy or pushing an agenda. This is a movie that truly understands and exemplifies the only statement possible in any language that will ever be <i>always</i> true: <i>""Nothing Is <b>ever</b> that simple.""</i> There are no universal answers to questions that matter, and the fact that the characters portrayed by Pegg and Nick Frost both find such true and deep happiness in the end despite their radically different choices, desires, and basic natures underlines that fact.

All the way back in 2008 I posed the question in an online forum, ""Which are you more looking forward to: the next Marvel Avengers movie, or the next Simon Pegg/Nick Frost/Edgar Wright movie?"" It's both wonderfully satisfying and professionally impressive to me that next year I'll get to see both options merge when Edgar Wright's <i>Ant-Man</i> adds the next Avenger to the team. I never would have foreseen that his career would reach the point where I could have both options at the same time, or for that matter that a such a gigantic media empire's blockbuster action franchise would make room for such a ""cultish"" director. I wish I were that wrong more often.

My only regret about <i>The World's End</i> (besides its inexplicably limited release, forcing me to find a carpool to travel almost 100 miles to see it) is the timing of the DVD release, when I just happen to be extremely short on funds. But this will be one of the ""one in a thousand"" movies that I simply can't even consider delaying adding to my collection.

There are so many exchanges you'll lose track if you don't keep up. It's just impossible to get the most out of it if you only watch it once. Put in the effort, and you will be thoroughly rewarded.

5571516,3,B00BBTNOE8,"Well ladies and gentlemen, the Cornetto trilogy has finally come to a close.  Whether you knew it or not, director Edgar Wright and writer/actor/producer Simon Pegg teamed up in 2004 to create the most loosely connected cinematic trilogy of all time beginning with Shaun of the Dead, followed by Hot Fuzz in 2007, and culminating in 2013 with The World's End.  The films share no characters, plot devices, settings, or  really any foreseeable connective quality.  What they do share is actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, passing references to a popular British ice cream treat called Cornetto, and a few surprises for die-hard fans.  Otherwise, these three films are as unrelated as could be.  What we're left with is a social commentary wrapped up in an inside joke that unfortunately has no solid punch line.

The World's End follows Peter, Andy, Oliver (also known as `Oman' because of an unfortunate birthmark shaped like a 6 on his forehead), and ringleader Gary.  In 1990, Gary (Simon Pegg) and his four best friends attempted and failed to complete ""The Golden Mile,"" a 12 tavern pub crawl in their hometown of Newton Haven that ends at a particular pub named The World's End.  Twenty years later, Gary's life has paled in comparison to that fabled night two decades ago, and while he has not quite left the wild days of his youth behind, his friends have.  After recounting his happier days at a rehab session, Gary decides to reconnect with his reluctant friends and convince them to give ""the Golden Mile"" one more go.

The World's End does very well moving from point A to point B providing lively introductions to the characters and Hangover-style laughs as the group of friends reminisce over past antics and attempt to reclaim the passion of their youth.  Pegg's performance as Gary is uproarious and sharp.  His reaction to Andy (Nick Frost) ordering a tap water rather than a proper pint is comic perfection, and his various monologues are quick witted, fast, and smart.  Unfortunately, the film hits a stumble moving from point B to point C and does a world class face plant on its way to point D.

I want to preface this next point by saying that I do not think From Dusk Til Dawn is a good film, nor do I feel that The World's End is a bad film, yet a comparison must be made.  From Dusk Til Dawn, the George Cloony/Quentin Tarantino vampire western, is notoriously critiqued in the following way: ""It was pretty good until the vampires showed up.""  The World's End will likely receive similar word of mouth, except replace ""vampires"" with ""alien robots.""  The movie does not come entirely off the rails upon the revelation of alien robots, but the tone becomes uneven and ""ludicrous"" becomes a word that might be used to describe the events from that point forward.  Proponents of the film will cite Shaun of the Dead as a film that similarly injects a sudden influx of horror into an otherwise silly comedy.  However, the mixing of genres in that film works far better than in this one.  The ""body snatching"" alien storyline interrupts all of the progress made in the film's first half and unfortunately leads to an incredibly unsatisfying conclusion.

The World's End is admittedly British.  By this, I mean that the humor, styling, and overall mood of the film is dry and at times very silly.  Fans of this type of humor know what I mean, and those who go through life saying, ""I don't understand what's so funny about Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" should stay miles away from The World's End.  The film works somewhat well as a critique on the globalization of society where the boys find the pubs they once loved for their individuality becoming increasingly ""starbucked,"" resembling one another in every detail.  Additionally, Wright and Pegg have written a film that cleverly alludes to films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and John Carpenter's The Thing in quite nuanced and ingeniously fresh ways.  Quite a bit works in The World's End, but ponderous choices are made from time to time that will leave audiences scratching their heads.  Overall, The World's End is funny but also preposterous, and it fails to successfully convey a satisfactory point about being middle-aged or the loss of youth, both of which are so strongly introduced in the film's first half.  I for one would enjoy a film about these five guys rehashing the past and drinking - end of story.  There is no doubt that Wright and Pegg are a good team, and while Pegg is becoming more of a household name thanks to high profile roles like Scotty in J.J. Abrams' Star Trek films, he still has plenty of passion for his roots.  As they leave the ""Cornetto"" behind, I think strong collaborations are in store for the future.  B-

The World's End is rated R and has a running time of 1 hour and 49 minutes.  Aside from Pegg and Frost, the cast also features some interesting cameos (some more obvious than others) as well as Martin Freeman (currently playing Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Hobbit films), who successfully revives the phrase ""WTF,"" and Rosamund Pike (soon to be seen in David Fincher's Gone Girl) who successfully revives the phrase ""oh crumbs.""",1382572800,5,5163,4.74468085106383

Will that stop our heroes from consuming a pint from each of the 12 finest pubs in Newton Haven?

Like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, the final installment in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy (unofficially named for the ice cream brand featured in the three films) is an outrageously goofy spoof, this time taking on the science-fiction genre. As a note to those unfamiliar with the series, the films are not directly connected; each has its own self-contained story. All three were written and directed by Edgar Wright, with starring roles courtesy of Simon Pegg (who also shares writing credit) and Nick Frost.

The World's End is not just a side-splitting comedy, but a good film that never delivers laughs at the expense of plot or character development. Performances from the leads are typically excellent. Pegg plays the irresponsible goofball Gary King, who can't take his mind off booze, even with a horde of robots in hot pursuit. Frost plays Gary's stern, no-nonsense friend Andy Knightley so well, the viewer will forget that the same actor played a roly-poly dimwit in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. A memorable supporting cast and CGI/action sequences on par with the highest-grossing superhero movies make it superior to the first film in the trilogy.

As the reader can infer from the spelling of the trilogy, The World's End is a British comedy, which is an acquired taste. American viewers expecting The Hangover with robots will be disappointed. The conclusion and subsequent epilogue aren't quite as inspired as they could be, and sci-fi buffs will notice certain hackneyed plot devices. While the supporting cast is vibrant and each one gets a moment in the sun, some, like Gary's other friends, aren't as well-developed as they should be. Frost's characters in Shaun of the Dead and (especially) Hot Fuzz stole every scene they were in, but Pegg isn't quite as successful portraying the stooge as he is a straight man.

The World's End is the funniest movie of the year, and a worthy conclusion to an exceptional trilogy. It is also a great starting point for those looking to enter a new world of comedy shunned by mainstream America.",1379980800,7,2453,4.805687203791469
5571521,5,B00BBTNOE8,"Director Edgar Wright has had, arguably, over the last 10 years, one of the best track records in Hollywood. Coming from his BBC comedy SPACED (in which he also worked with this film's two leads), he brought us SHAUN OF THE DEAD, a slice of fried gold satire/love letter to zombie films, then onto the wonderful HOT FUZZ, another satire/love letter to the buddy-cop genre, then what I consider to be his best film yet, the fiim adaptation of Bryan Lee O'Malley's indie comic SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, and now, he brings us THE WORLD'S END, part reunion comedy/part alien invasion disaster film, and with this, he brings his ""Cornetto"" or ""Blood and Ice Cream"" trilogy (included with SHAUN and FUZZ) to a wonderfully entertaining, supremely hilarious and, at times, incredibly moving end.

The basic gist of the film is this: Five high-school friends have come back together in their small hometown in England to complete a 12-bar ""pub crawl"" that they attempted after their graduation, but didn't complete. Led by Gary King (Simon Pegg), a man wounded at spending his days trying to relive his youth, he assembles his four old friends Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), Peter (Eddie Marsan) and Andy (Nick Frost), all of whom have gone on to lead successful adult lives without Gary, to complete this pub crawl with the final bar being ""The World's End"". As they go from pub to pub, Gary and Steve meet an old flame, Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), and they notice strange goings-on around the town. Secrets about the friends lives are revealed and secrets about the town are revealed, and by the time they reach The World's End, it could very well be just that.

First, the performances. They are all very top-notch, although, as with all of the other films of this trilogy, it features two stand-outs: Pegg and Frost. In SHAUN and FUZZ, though, it was Pegg as the somewhat-upstanding fellow and Frost as the irresponsible man-child. Here, in END, it's the reverse as Gary who is an alcoholic and addict, and Andy as his former best friend who has had enough of Gary's childish antics, and they do what I consider to be the best work of their respective careers. Second, the comedy. As written by Wright and Pegg, it's a tad more restrained than the more broad comedy of SHAUN and FUZZ, but it may resonate even more because there are a few scenes of unusually powerful and heartfelt drama here. Third, the direction. Wright proves that he doesn't know how to go into a slump as the film features some wonderful, eye-popping visuals and some fight scenes that are on par with the excitement of other summer films that have ten times the budget. One fight scene in particular evokes a Jackie Chan style where Gary does everything he can to chug his pint while being beset on all sides by various assailants. It's an astonishing sequence that hearkens back to the choreography that Wright showcased so brilliantly in SCOTT PILGRIM. The ending of the film might cause some casual filmgoers to feel a bit lost, but that's not a loss for the film and for fans of Wright's work.

I know that the ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS meets THE BIG CHILL"" idea may not be the biggest draw for many people, THE WORLD'S END may very well end up being the most well-rounded and well-made film of this year's summer season, and certainly one of the most entertaining and lasting films of the year. I'm sad that it couldn't find a big American audience, but Wright's films, despite how great they are, seldom do. But they're usually discovered later on home video, and then most will find out what they missed out on on the big screen.

And I can still only hope that Wright, Pegg and Frost can find any excuse to team up again.",1379894400,2,3735,4.671732522796352

I would put this one between Shaun and Paul. A little more mainstream but still very British and has that type of dry humor at times.

The central theme is ""you can't go back"". You can't go back to the home town you left years ago, you can't pick up relationships that died when you were a teenager and, as becomes gradually and painfully apparent to anyone older than, say, 35, you will NEVER be 18 again. Everything changes and rarely for the better. So there is a deliciously poignant, bittersweet undercurrent for anyone who's ever looked at an old photo of themselves and then looked in the mirror and wondered where the f  k the last 20-odd years went. This is driven home by some shocking close-ups of Pegg which show that he's no longer quite as fresh-faced and cherubic as he was in Spaced...

It's not all doom and gloom - TWE is a joyful, rip-roaring sci-fi comedy adventure. As with Shaun and Fuzz, TWE is not a parody of its chosen genre, it is very much OF it, but with laughs. All the traditional Wright/Pegg/Frost humour is here, laughs aplenty, slapstick, subtle mugs, and visual & observational jokes. The pop-references that define Shaun of the Fuzz are still here albeit a bit less ""obvious"". And of course the team are fastidious about keeping the running gags going (the fence-jump gag drew some of the loudest laughs in the cinema). So there IS a bit of a contradiction here - TWE is /telling/ us that ""you can't go back"", but that is, precisely what they're trying to do by keeping the Shaun of the Fuzz traditions alive and well.

The fights (done in the Neo vs Agent Smith style) are what gives the movie its pace and they're choreographed to perfection, if somewhat over-relied upon. True to the Cornetto form, with plenty of gore to go around (although not your conventional red stuff).

However, plot-pacing does seem to be a have been a problem. The movie grinds to a jarring and abrupt halt about 30m from the end so that the robot invasion can be explained to the audience in a long and intrusively talky expositional scene by a alien (Bill Nighy) of superior intelligence and technology, but who seems to be stuck with the Windows Phone 8 operating system. This includes a toe-curlingly cringeworthy bit where Gary and Andy (Frost) ""speak up for humanity"" and I started peeking at my watch. The movie does try to recover (and almost succeeds) with a breathless Bond-esque ""blow it all up"" finale, but then stalls again in the ""what happened to everyone afterwards"" exposit. Cue credits.

As for the acting? There's a wonderfully familiar cast with all of the well-established Cornetto veterans strutting their stuff, front, centre and rear. Unsurprisingly, the two leading men dominate the movie; Nick Frost turns out a surprisingly decent dramatic performance to prove that he's got potential way beyond his familiar ""funny fat bloke"" persona. The supporting cast do fade into the background to a greater or lesser degree; Martin Freeman is good value but Paddy Considine does little more than make up the numbers. It's great to see Eddie Marsan although, like Considine, his considerable talents are rather wasted in this supporting role.

The World's End is a great film, funny and exciting and, if it suffers badly from a sudden change of gear (almost into reverse?) at the end. It's definitely the weakest of the trilogy but it easily makes up for that abomination&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul/dp/B003GAMOMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul</a>&nbsp;and demonstrates that the guys haven't lost it. Very much for an audience of a ""certain age"" although there was a younger (late-teen) contingent in the cinema who also appeared to enjoy it. TWE also has great ""re-watch"" potential and much enjoyment is to be gained from trying to spot the various references and also to savour and unpick the complex fight scenes.

5571525,5,B00BBTNOE8,"This movie is hilarious, brilliant and just an all around work of art. Edgar Wright is an amazing director (there are some very nice fight scenes) and of course Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are both wonderful actors. Also, Martin Freeman. Amazing story, great humor and great English-ness. All I can say is watch it. I seem to have read some reviews from people who really disliked this movie for reasons I'm sure I can't imagine...and I say, have you no soul? Really, it's wonderful stuff. If you watch it your first time without knowing anything about it which I recommend, you're in for the best surprise ever. I went to theaters knowing nothing about what I was getting into, and man I walked out of that theater high on happiness and satisfaction. And I did it again the next week. And now I have to own the movie. (So count me in for the pre-order! And I hate buying movies anywhere except from the $5 bin... heh). And I also don't believe in any spoilers, so you won't get any out of this review.",1379203200,4,1000,4.410810810810811
5571526,5,B00BBTNOE8,"In 1990, in the town of Newton Haven, Gary King (Simon Pegg) leads a group of young men on an adventure down the Golden Mile as they attempt to visit all 12 pubs in one night, winding up at ""The World's End."" They never completed the trek. The group grew up and scattered. Gary has decided he needs to go back and do the 12 pub drinking trek at age 40 as a rite of passage, his life's accomplishment. He gets the reluctant gang back and off they go.

The film starts out like a fairy decent comedy and then suddenly Newton turns into Stepford. In spite of their lives and the planet being in danger, Gary still wants to complete the quest as the best way NOT to draw attention to themselves. The film was funny and when the Doors started to play, I had to laugh and sing with the film.

The theme of the film is about conformity as a swap of freedoms for comfort. It portrays conformists as robots of the system, all working for the common good.

Good quirky comedy that will be added to my collection. Highly recommended for those who like a smart British comedy.

5571527,4,B00BBTNOE8,"The irreverent comedy trio of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost are responsible for some pretty hard-hitting comedies, including the widely praised&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0018OFN4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(spoofing horror/zombie films) and the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hot-Fuzz/dp/B000VK99Z6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hot Fuzz</a>&nbsp;(spoofing action/thrillers). They're back with another earnest spoof, this one of the sci-fi genre, although you wouldn't know it if you walked out just before the halfway mark.

The film, THE WORLD'S END, follows a group of five friends who, after experiencing a wild and crazy (and unfinished) pub crawl as high schoolers, ended up drifting far, far apart. Gary King, the self-appointed alpha male of the group, returns after a decade and change with the intent of reuniting the group to complete the pub crawl they never finished. Now with careers, softening middle sections, and children at home, its a sketchy proposition as they try to recapture the glory of their youth in the unlikely ""golden mile"" of their hometown's stretch of booze joints.

As with all of the Wright/Frost/Pegg vehicles, the dialogue is snappy, brisk, and witty, the comedy is slick, curly, and inventive, and the story doesn't sacrifice character depth for cheap laughs (even if it doesn't hesitate to get in a cheap laugh when possible). The attempt to make things relevant and real does slow the first half down, making the sudden switch into science fiction feel half-baked. Halfway through reliving the pub crawl, our five-some begin to realize that sinister things are afoot in their hometown. (This, actually, is a running theme for the Wright/Pegg/Frost films: a small group ends up battling an entire town is pretty much the basic plot of all of their movies.) As the night begins to decay into madness, the film speeds up to an almost relentless pace that, while invigorating and fun to watch (there are a whole lot of candy-sweet action sequences to sink your teeth into), tends to blur past some pretty serious crevices in the plot.

At the start, it feels a lot like the film is doing a clever, tongue-in-cheek, almost brilliant metaphor for how you can never go home again, and what it means to grow up versus holding on to childhood, but the possibility for deep moralizing or even just thoughtful parabolizing is tossed aside for some fairly flat jokes. That's not really so bad; the movie doesn't have to mean much as long as it's entertaining. However, by the time our gentlemen reach the last pub on their list -- the aptly titled The World's End -- the script has expended so much steam and adrenaline that the film feels exhausted, tying up all of its loose ends with a pretty silly lecture from both the good guys and bad, capping it all off with an equally lazy voice over to give the audience some closure. It feels like the final ten minutes of the film were made up on the spot, and not all of it makes much sense.

While most of the movie is a ton of fun to watch and is truly engaging on multiple levels, the intensely human comedy of the first half ends up dissolving into the cartoonishly caricatured comedy of the second half. Both halves by themselves aren't bad at all, but the way they inexpertly mesh leaves behind more than a few plotholes, as well as the sense that the movie isn't as good as it could have been.",1378771200,2,3537,5.189141856392294
