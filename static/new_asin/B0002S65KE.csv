8030956,4,B0002S65KE,"This is a decent horror film from Japan. I usually don't turn my head away from horror movies, but I had to turn my head away during the scene with the brain transfer. I guess that is saying something. It is a bit strange, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.",1440374400,,260,4.019230769230769
8030957,4,B0002S65KE,"This is not your typical horror movie, and I can see why the such low rating, but this movie is a solid 4 star because it was well done. This movie was not made as a straight out horror, but instead the idea of having your brain replaced by someone you've always loved your whole life is the horror of it all. This is not horror in a sense of blood and gore but a well crafted story that makes you think what if, that my friend in a sense is scary stuff. So, check it out. For a 1996 film, it was well done and very enjoyable to watch.",1360540800,,535,3.8727272727272726
8030958,3,B0002S65KE,"Baptism of Blood (Kenichi Yoshihara, 1996)

A Japanese horror flick from the mid-nineties with a name like Baptism in Blood? I know exactly what you're thinking, which is exactly what I was thinking when I sat down to watch this. I couldn't have been more wrong about what I was getting myself into, and neither are you. While it's considered a horror film (and based on a manga from Kazuo Umezu, who's kind of the manga version of Stephen King), what Yoshihara turns in in his only movie to date is actually more of an elaborate, if cheesy, mystery flick that would have been right at home in the early seventies.

Matsuko Uehara (Detective Story's Risa Akikawa) was once a famous actress, but a skin disease caused her to retire early from the cinema. She and her friend/doctor, Edmond Meredith (Tatsuya Go in his only screen appearance), devise a plan to transfer her brain from her body to that of her lovely daughter Sakura (Legend of the Devil's Rie Imamura) in order to regain her old life. She's also attracted to Sakura's handsome piano teacher Masahiko (Chihiro Tago, also in his only screen appearance), who is struggling with his own attraction to Sakura, to whom he wants to flee in order to escape the constant nagging of his shrewish, pregnant wife (Lucky Sky Diamond's Naoko Amihama). When Sakura finds out about the plan, she tries to escape, but nothing is ever so easy in movies.

It had a lot of potential, and I'm sure that with a slightly firmer guiding hand, it could have been a crime-film classic, but it was not to be. I found it hard to tell all too often whether the low-budget-early-seventies feel of the film was an homage to the crime dramas of the time or whether it was simply a function of the movie's budget, and no one attempted to work beyond what they were given. The acting is in most cases quite good, and Tago is especially impressive for never having been on a screen before. The team probably blew about three quarters of their budget on the brain-transfer effects; the machine is huge, Rude Goldberg-ian (it's been called Crononbergesque, though I'm not sure I'd go that far), and insanely amusing. In a movie where very little attention was paid to the surroundings, the effects got top bill. I'm not sure whether I should respect or disparage this, but as dingy as everything else is, it's hard not to be impressed with that scene. And the ending... oh, the ending. A couple of big, big twists I never saw coming, and it really should have been a complete blast. Yoshihara knew exactly how to build all this up so that it worked when presented, with both of the big twists; this ends up being a very complex little movie, and I'm halfway talking myself into giving it a higher rating than I had originally intended, but when the two big twists hit, I found myself thinking, ""oh, really?"". They should have been showstoppers, and they just... weren't. I can't put my finger on why, all the ingredients are here, but somewhere along the way, the souffle falls. Still worth seeing if you can look at unlimited potential and say ""yeah, that could have been great."" And there is a good amount to like about this unassuming little thriller. ***",1285027200,2,3184,4.6219081272084805
8030959,2,B0002S65KE,"Matsuko Uehara is a once-glamorous actress now suffering from a disfiguring skin disease.  Stage makeup can no longer hide it, and she is forced to retire in seclusion.  Grown ever more bitter in her senior years, she finally puts in motion a plan to have her brain transplanted into the body of her beautiful teenaged daughter Sakura.

The events that follow are of such mind-boggling implausibility that they beggar description.  Despite being many years in the making, Matsuko's plan isn't very well thought-out, and things fall apart pretty quickly.  Her original body goes missing, a detective starts poking his nose in, and a relationship develops with Sakura's married piano instructor who, as executor of the Uehara estate, has an agenda of his own.

Although there's only one really gory scene (in which brains are removed and juggled about by a machine that looks like it came out of Freddy's boiler room) BAPTISM OF BLOOD struck me as the Asian version of a Herschell Gordon Lewis flick.  The tone is similar, the acting as bad, and the plot just as ludicrous.

I won't even go into the twist ending, or the absurd psychological explanation involved.

The only thing that keeps me from giving the film only one star is that it is unintentionally hilarious and thus entertaining on some level, and that there's a pretty girl to look at.  (The most horrifying thing was seeing her beautiful head of hair get shaved for the transplant operation.  I nearly cried.)  It's not a good movie by any means, but it could be fun to invite from friends over and give it the MST3K treatment.  At least it's budget-priced.

The DVD has no extras other than trailers for other Asia Pulp Cinema releases which look equally as bad.",1125360000,2,1725,4.803389830508475
