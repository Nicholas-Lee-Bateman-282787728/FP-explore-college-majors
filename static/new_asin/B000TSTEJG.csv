2909383,5,B000TSTEJG,"Does anyone know if the Superfriends DVD's all come with the PSA ads? If they don't, my question then is why not? That's what made kids all want to better their lives and become the successes we now see in business and what not, isn't it? Knowing people like Superman et. all see them as human beings capable of being super in their own mortal lives, if not for just 30 seconds on saturday mornings in between cartoon episodes? It's propaganda to NOT have that now when this war is BLOODIER and we DON'T know for sure how many lives have been lost. If anything else, these should be considered and added to honor the legacy of two talented indviduals on SF staff who helped bring this show to life: Alex Toth and Iwao Takamoto. Thank you.",1189209600,3,738,4.394160583941606
2909384,5,B000TSTEJG,"A great collection of cartoons feature DC Comic characters well drawn. Most of the incidental music is borrowed from HB's Godzilla show. (Check out current vol 1-3 releases).
Cyborg (of New Teen Titans in the comics) joins the team.
The art work is improved after Super Friends. The beginning theme revamps the first series of 1 hour Super Friends episodes theme from 1973. It would be nice to see them eventually release the remaining Super Friends serieses:
Super Friends (1973)
All New Super Friends Hour (1976; 4 stories per show: Team ups , Wonder Twins, Full team, Guest star team us)
Worlds Greatest Superfriends (1980)
Let's keep hoping. IN the mean time, enjoy these. They're addictive viewing, with some solid gritty stories focussed on Superman, Batman, Darkeseid, and Firestorm",1189209600,7,789,5.124031007751938
2909385,5,B000TSTEJG,"Well this is it, the final chapter of the Hanna-Barbera saga of the Justice League of America, and we go out with more treats for comic fans.  There's appearances by past adversaries like Mxyzptlk, Brainiac, the Scarecrow (finally portrayed as he was meant to be!), and of course Darkseid and company, but we also have newcomers to the series like Felix Faust, the Penguin, the Joker, and the Royal Flush Gang.  We have another new hero in Cyborg (sorry, Teen Titans fans, no booyahing to be found here) and the exit of campy characters like the Wonder Twins.  And the stories!  Superman ""dies,"" Batman's origin is told on TV for the first time, and we also get probably the best and most original-spirited version of the Bizarros at the time (as they are now totally played for comedy).  The characters all receive makeovers from their Alex Toth roots as well, some subtle, some more noticeable.

Did the series reach Timmverse-like quality?  No.  But it definitely concluded with a new hint of maturity.",1187049600,59,1005,4.8023255813953485
2909386,5,B000TSTEJG,"This is it!! If you started collecting from the first DVD release, then you know it wasn't a journey but a struggle. Warner Bros releases of this cartoon were tortue.

2909389,5,B000TSTEJG,"The best of the Super Powers seasons, hand down. You can begin to see the evolution of Super Heroes cartoons into what they become in the 90's. I don't like Adam West as Batman though, I have to admit - I prefer the voice actor from Challenge of the Superfriends.",1442361600,2,263,4.28
2909390,4,B000TSTEJG,"Like most of Warner's complication of the Super Friends series - terrible. The DVD authoring and restoration is much to be desired. I don't understand Warner. They have the opportunity to restore animated classics and yet alter the way it was originally broadcast for some reason, a reason that points to the ill-fated attempt to show how ""wonderful Warner is"" (they are not). I would have given this more stars if the presentation of the DVD was worth it. The title card for the Bizarro Super Powers Team is missing (and it was made in the original broadcast).

The cartoons are OK and since Warner holds the rights for now this is the best you can get from the classic Super Friends series produced by the talented Hanna-Barbera. It does show how this show influenced many other contemporary programs such as the Justice League/Unlimited and even other offerings from Marvel, Family Guy and The Simpsons.

At the time this was made Superman was perceived to be the all-powerful untouchable hero who would be overcome by kryptonite and red sun energy while Wonder Woman and Batman would occasionally exert their full abilities depending on the writer of the story. Watching the story with one of these latter characters would beg the question, ""hang on, they CAN do this and this and yet are doing NOTHING, why?""

This is by far the best of all the Super Friends series. The story telling and art changed with this season and it is a large pity it did not continue. The change to Super Powers Team was a great idea that should have continued.",1440028800,,1543,4.707407407407407

2909413,5,B000TSTEJG,"This is a great Cartoon DVD. It was from an era that saw the legends in Cartoon voice-over work doing some of their final works, like Danny Dark, who in my mind WAS Superman, as much as Kevin Conroy is Batman today in the animated series.
The list of incredibly talented Voice Over legends are in this series, and this is what helps make it a must-buy in my opinion.
There's Frank Welker, Adam West, Danny Dark, BJ Ward, Rene Auberjonois, Peter Cullen, Jack Angel, and the PHENOMENAL voice of the recently passed Michael Rye- who magnificently voiced Hal Jordan/Green Lantern.
Great voice-work done in this series.
The plots were really good for this era, too. As compared with the 1960's, where there were no plots at all, this is vastly superior in Animation Artwork and plotlines.
This is really the prequel to the Justice League series that we saw that came out 10 years ago.
My only problem with this series, is that there weren't more of these episodes made. There are only about 10 episodes overall, and not the standard number that one would expect to come out of this genre of cartooning. It would have been nice to extend this series for another 2 years, and get more work and extra episodes to continue on with the storylines.",1415577600,,1237,4.601809954751131

2909425,5,B000TSTEJG,"Every fault that existed in the previous incarnations is addressed and corrected.
First, the Alex Toth character designs are replaced by the dynamic visuals of the
more contemporary Jose Luis Garcia-Lopez.  The menace of Darkseid, Brainiac
and a score of DC villains turn it loose considerably to good dramatic effect.
Cyborg is introduced and joins the team.  This bold and smart addition would not
be reflected in the published book for years.  Bonus points!  Firestorm is the other
personality of the team and the two play well off each other.

It is unfortunate that the editorial staff at DC Comics did not take a hint or two from
the show and carry over some of the format as it was superior to the Justice League comic.
The best of a great season are ""The Death of Superman"" paying homage to a silver
age tale adapted to the current format.  ""The Fear"" presents the origin of the Batman
for the first time outside the comics medium.  A nice retrospective feature acknowledges
the increased production values.  My only problem.  No commentary tracks.  Perhaps,
it was felt the the quality of the episodes speak for themselves.  I would tend to agree.",1395446400,,1156,4.787878787878788
2909426,5,B000TSTEJG,I love sharing childhood memories with my son as we watch shows and these cartoons deliver just that sort of bonding with my son!  Love it!  Great memories both past and present.,1395100800,,178,4.53125
2909427,5,B000TSTEJG,I suppose there was a reason legally for not calling them the Justice League but the stories were spot on and in line with the League in every way besides.  Enjoyed very much.,1394150400,,175,4.303030303030303

2909432,4,B000TSTEJG,"This DVD set collects all 8 episodes of The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, the final incarnation of Super Friends, which originally aired circa 1985.  It was intended as a tie-in to the Super Powers action figure line, but it never feels like a 20-minute commercial for toys.  The quality of animation and storytelling on Super Friends always varied (it was certainly no Batman: The Animated Series) but it always had a particular charm to it.  This final season does not fail to deliver in that respect.  The animation here is the best that Super Friends ever had; Darkseid is especially frightening, looking as if he just clawed his way out of a Jack Kirby comic. (There's no explanation for why neither Green Lantern nor Hawkman have eyeballs, though.)  The writing is slightly more sophisticated as well; while I wouldn't say it's Macbeth, there's at least an attempt to tell stories with themes and have actual character development.  For instance, Superman, Batman, and Cyborg are actually allowed to have angst! Episodes such as ""Escape from Space City"" and ""The Death of Superman"" take things in directions that a typical 80s Saturday morning cartoon never dared.  Today the show seems as quaint as any season of Super Friends, but it's easy to see how this show was a bridge to the renaissance of DC Animation in the 90s that led to shows such as the Batman and Superman animated series, Batman Beyond, and Justice League/Justice League Unlimited.  Longtime comics fans will definitely appreciate the fact that these episodes take comics lore into account.  The characters appear as their civilian alter egos more often; longtime supporting characters make a few appearances; villains such as Felix Faust and the Royal Flush Gang, and settings such as the Bizarro World and Superman's Fortress of Solitude are even featured.  This set also includes ""The Fear"", and although this set is a little expensive for only 8 episodes, ""The Fear"" alone makes it worth it.  My memories of watching Super Friends as a child are usually vague, but I still recall that episode's haunting retelling of Batman's origin story in exact detail.",1367712000,3,2142,4.98876404494382
2909452,5,B000TSTEJG,"There seem to be a few people out there who wan to discount this show merely an animated toy commercial.
But those same people forget that popular and well-loved shows (""G.I. Joe"" and ""Transformers"", to name 2 out of many) were animated toy commercials.

ALL of the Super Friends shows, and basically ANY television show, were marketing schemes. They're designed to get kids to buy toys, lunch boxes, flooring books, halloween costumes, and toys. If you don't think that then you're naive.

""Legendary Super Powers"" and ""Super Powers: Galactic Guardians"" were the first shows to actually attempt to truly emulate the comics featuring detailed character designs and a noticeable increase in production values.
Specifically ""Super Powers: Galactic Guardians"", using the current DC comics character designs from Jos Luis Garca-Lpez.

They were the first time since the late 1960s (i.e. ""Aquaman"", ""The NEW Adventures of Superman"", and ""Batman With Robin the Boy Wonder"", which contained real comic villains and more action-oriented stories) that parent groups loosened their death-grip on cartoon programming to include more adult themes like the murder of Batman's parents and the death of. Superman. And the inclusions of more menacing villains like Darkseid and the redesigned Brainiac.

When those shows wanted to appeal to the teenage demographic, they didn't include The Wonder Twins teaching about peer pressure; or Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog. They included Firestorm, a character with actual development and emotional content, with a unique perspective. Just watch the episode ""The Death of Superman"", for proof of that.

When they wanted to include racial diversity, they didn't use pointless and awful stereotypes like El Dorado. They included actual comic book characters like Cyborg, who had depth and actual characterization.

This show also featured action, dynamic camera angles, and not the same old left to fight flat repetitive motion Hanna-Barbara had become famous for throughout the 70s. Gone away was the constraining ""Scooby-Doo"" formula and style. The ""Super Powers"" show was a return to form for Hanna-Barbara, a renaissance of actual plotting, individual characterization, and action that hadn't been seen since shows like Johnny Quest, Birdman, and Space Ghost. Only, the ""Super Powers"" show did it even better.",1364688000,7,2337,5.45983379501385

2909458,5,B000TSTEJG,"""The Super Powers Team: Galactica Guardians"" was the final entry in the long-running cartoon...but it went out with a bang with some of the smartest written and best-animated super-hero sagas you could ask for. The DVD comes with all eight episodes (ten if you include the double-stacked stories):

The Seeds of Doom: When Lex Luthor runs wild in Metropolis, the young hero Cyborg stops him but turns down an offer to join the Super Powers Team. Firestrom tries to talk him into joining when they find Kalibak planting a seed that turns into a massive monster. Darkseid threatens to unleash more on the world, turning Earth into a new Apokolips unless the team swears allegiance to him. Cyborg is talked into helping Firestorm and Wonder Woman go to Apokolips and get the location of the seeds.

The Ghost Ship: While in a distant galaxy, Superman, Firestorm and Cyborg come across a ship with an entire race in suspended animation and have to keep them from Darkseid's hands. A nice touch in the fact that as they're under an orange sun, Superman isn't as powerful as he could be.
The Bizarro Super Powers Team: While being honored at a youth ceremony, Firestorm, Cyborg and Wonder Woman are taken aback when Bizarro, Superman's idiot double, uses a device to create Bizarro versions of them. To make matters worse, the imp Mr. Mytzlplyx drops by to have fun by ""training"" the Bizarro heroes and the three have to stop the madness.

The Darkseid Deception: Darkseid captures Steve Trevor and takes his place to switch a satellite as part of a plot to transform Earth's inhabitants into parademons. Capturing Wonder Woman, he turns her to glass and Trevor to an ape creature as the others have to rescue them.

The Fear: While chasing the Scarecrow in Gotham City, Batman is overwhelmed when he finds himself in the place where his parents were murdered. He has to overcome his fear to save Robin and Wonder Woman from the Scarecrow's clutches. Notable for being the first story outside of comics to show the dark origins of the Dark Knight.

The Wild Cards: A figure named Ace turns a pack of crooks into the Royal Flush Gang to capture Superman, Wonder Woman and Firestorm. Chasing the crooks down, Batman figures out that ""Ace"" is actually the Joker as they face a new attack on Earth.

Brainchild: Brainiac captures Cyborg, planning to the heroe's mind in a new powerful body at the robot's command.
The Case of the Stolen Super Powers: The magical crook Felix Faust casts a spell to steal Superman's powers. But when the Penquin interferes, the waddling crook becomes the most powerful villain on Earth. A powerless Superman must help the others get his abilities back.

The Death of Superman: When Superman apparantly succumbs to Kryptonite while on a space mission, Firestorm blames himself and Darkseid uses the opportunity to take over the Hall of Justice. But when other heroes discover Superman may be alive, they race against time to save him.

Escape From Star City: Investigating a massive space city, Firestorm, Batman and Samurai discover Darkseid plans to use the city as a space fortress against Earth.

The episodes are quite well done in animation with some smarter writing than usual. In one story, Firestorm is held in a force field attuned to his body chemistry. However, by splitting into his two human halves, he's able to escape it. The addition of Cyborg is a good one as he fits well with the team with his unique abilities and friendship with Firestorm. Another nice bit has Firestorm impersonating Green Lantern to attack Brainiac's yellow force field. Darkseid is a terrific villain, powerful and foreboding. One of my favorite moments is when a scheme goes wrong, Desaad and Kalibak noting he hasn't moved in an hour. ""Perhaps he's thinking of revenge on the heroes."" ""Let's hope so....for our sakes.""

""The Fear"" and ""Death of Superman"" are both powerful, darker than you usually saw at the time. The extra is a nice discussion between folks like Mark Waid and Dan DiDo, noting how the show really set the stage for the later ""Batman"" and ""Justice League"" series. A shame it couldn't go longer but still a fantastic way to go out on top and a delight for old-time DC fans.",1270944000,3,4205,4.795580110497237
2909459,5,B000TSTEJG,"I enjoy this dvd and would recommend it to fans of Super Heros cartoons.  Fun to watch amd brings me memories of my childhood. I still watch cartoons at my age (56),
and it is a great stress buster.",1258588800,,198,4.076923076923077
2909460,4,B000TSTEJG,"I have been guilty of buying up all of the prior Superfriends collections and, sadly, not for their intricate plots or beautiful artwork.  No, indeed nostalgia is a powerful motivator in these instances and so I thought when my chronological Superfriends collection led me toward purchasing The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, the final incarnation of the Superfriends formula.

I came into the set expecting a slightly modified variation of the Legendary Super Powers Show (which was the season before Galactic Guardians by the way); a show that I felt made vast improvements over seasons prior.  What I found in Galactic Guardians was a revolution not only in just the realm of the Superfriends, but also what I thought was possible within the heavily restricted realm of Saturday morning cartoons circa 1985.

A closer look at what makes this incarnation vastly superior to prior efforts reveals a cast of individuals who would continue going on producing beautiful DCAU efforts even up through today:  Andrea Romano (Batman: Animated series, Batman Beyond, Justice League, JL Unlimited, The Batman) directs the voice talent here and story editor Allan Barnett (The Batman) appears on the roster as well.  Clearly this show was the stepping-stone to what would eventually become the DCAU as we know it today.  Plus, thanks to reworked character models from none-other than famed comic artist Jos Luis Garca-Lpez, the team received a much-needed makeover which coincided with DC comic books at the time.

The writing matured to include much more space-scenarios with (thankfully) an improved scientific understanding throughout.  Rather than carbon copy characters in different costumes, for the first time we receive individual personalities, struggles, and conflicts of each of the members of the Justice League of America (which are renamed the Super Powers Team here to better reflect Kenner's corresponding toyline).

The villinans are given their proper due as well and, much to my appreciation, are used to near perfection.  The Penguin, Lex Luthor, Brianiac, Darkseide, Felix Faust, The Royal Flush Gang, and even the Scarecrow make wonderful appearances.

The show's writers seemed also to finally have figured out that the only way to balance out a cast as diverse and powerful as the Justice League, separation is a necessity (a technique later mastered in Justice League).  Many episodes focus on only one or two members of the Team which allows for far better story arcs and character development.  Gone are the Wondertwins (thankfully) and signed on is Cyborg who, like his comic book character, is quite well done and allows the younger set (who know him from Teen Titans) an opportunity for appreciation.

Episodes that stand out are The Fear, whereby for the first time we receive a Superfriends episode with our heroes out of costume and also Bruce Wayne's backstory masterfully told without ever showing a gun onscreen.  Death of Superman also comes on strong considering just a few short seasons earlier the word ""death"" was strictly prohibited.  Here it shows up in the very title of one of the episodes which just so happened to be one of the hottest selling comic books of the era.

In conclusion, The Super Powers Team: Galacatic Guardians was perhaps the biggest step in the right direction for the Superfriends franchise possible.  While the rest of the sets I purchased for nestolgia, this one earned a place through genuine entertainment value.  I can go as far as to say that had the Superfriends show continued to evolve along these lines, Justice League would have eventually resulted even without the stunning vision that was Batman (and Superman) the Animated Series as steppingstones.",1228867200,14,3727,5.18

2909475,5,B000TSTEJG,"This series, ""The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians"", ran in the 80s and only made 8 episodes.  All 8 are in this set:

Disk 1:
  The Seeds of Doom
  Ghost ship
  The Bizarro Super Powers Team
  Darkseid Deception
  The Fear

Disk 2:
  The Wild Cards
  Brainchild
  Escape From Space City
  The Death of Superman

A couple of the above episodes are split in half to create 2 ""shorts"" - so the dvd says it's 10 episodes, but it's actually 8.

My daughter (& I) enjoyed the slightly more modernized style in this version compared to the 70s series.  It's a tad more *cinematic* than it's predecessors, appearing to (barely) foreshadow the more naturalized drawings, scripts, and styles of the 90s animations.

The superfriends maintain their black & white, one-dimensional, clear cut *good* personalities so prominent in the 70s series. So, while the cartoon style seems updated, they have not yet written the multifaceted behaviors that the characters of today posess.

I find that one-dimensional-ness charming and *safe* for my young daughter to watch, providing great conversation fodder, they are so firm in their by-the-book behaviors, while today's characters are more jaded and likely to bend rules. Of course, today's characters provide great fodder in other ways, just that the older series is a safer starting point for children.

As a side note, I loved the addition  of a strong, black superhero, (Cyborg), as well as the fact that it was his father who was the brilliant and talented man who invented the cyborg technology to save his son.",1201132800,31,1555,4.922480620155039

2909478,5,B000TSTEJG,"What can I say? I grew up and started reading comics in the 60s thru 1990. It was a simple time for a kid, heroes were good and villains were evil. Sometimes I just want to go back to the simple times, no hard plot lines, just something to watch and relax with on the couch with the cat. These were the best cartoon depictions of the JLA that they ever did.",1195430400,4,357,3.9722222222222223
2909479,3,B000TSTEJG,"I have enjoyed Superman, Batman, Justice League comics for years -- and I totally enjoyed this DVD. It has 4 22-minute episodes on two discs. All of the stories are good ones, the animation is first-rate and having Adam West voice the role of Batman is a stroke of genius. For those of us old enough to remember him on TV as Batman, he brought back those memories and more with each line uttered.

This DVD was intended to bring the Superfriends to a new level -- a more mature look and story level. But it is not one that is overly violent or crass. I can see my nephew's children sitting around the monitor watching this with interest and excitement. It brings new focus to Firestorm and Cyborg and tempers the story with ideas very relevant to today's society. Those individuals dealing with handicaps or disabilities can contribute significantly to society and we see that through the eyes of Cyborg, a young man injured in an accident and kept alive with mechanical implants.

As with any videos, parents should always watch them with their children in case there are questions to be answered -- or they may want to point out some of the finer points of the story. The good triumphs over evil is good -- no matter what the age of the audience.",1195257600,3,1248,4.517699115044247
2909480,5,B000TSTEJG,"This DVD contains 8 half-hour episodes...however, because two episodes were split into 15 minute segments each, the promoters of the DVD are saying there are 10 episodes here. This installment of SUPERFRIENDS was very serious...there was no narration, which will be noticed right away. In all of the episodes of the series, William Woodson was heard as the narrator...his catchphrase ""meanwhile...at the Hall of Justice..."" became as synonymous with the series as the superhero's themselves. In this installment, which hit Saturday morning TV in 1985, there was no narration and the Hall of Justice had received a make-over. It now looked like an intergalactic headquarters one might find on a far off planet in the galaxy.

The appearances of the characters were more defined as well...more realistically drawn as compared to the ""cartoonish"" look of the previous versions of SUPERFRIENDS, which i'm not knocking...i like all depictions of the Superfriends during it's classic era, 1973-1985. One important note...the super-hero's were officially calling themselves the Super Powers Team...even the villains who for years had referred to them as ""Superfriends"" were now calling them ""Super Powers Team"". There are several episodes in this 1985 series that are years ahead of their time with regard to character study. In one episode, the brilliant ""The Fear"", Batman is center stage as is the homicidal villain, Scarecrow, who is played more sinister than he was on CHALLENGE OF THE SUPERFRIENDS. New voice actor as well...the previous voice was provided by Don Messick.

""The Fear"" tells the story of Batman's origin...it is noted that this episode was the very first time Batman's history was recalled in animated form.

Darkseid, a God from Apokolips, is the main villain of this series...just as he was in the previous installment in 1984, THE LEGENDARY SUPER POWERS SHOW.

In one of the episodes, one of the 15 minute offerings, we have ""The Case of the Stolen Super Powers"". In that episode we are treated to an appearance by the Penguin and Felix Faust...of course, everyone knows the Penguin is one of Batman's main villains.

The Joker, Batman's #1 enemy, turns up in the episode ""The Wild Cards"". This episode has to do with a gang that goes by the name of The Royal Flush. This episode and the other episode i just wrote about ""The Case of the Stolen Super Powers"", mark the only apperances on the Superfriends series of The Joker and The Penguin. The two villains were missing in all of the other versions of the show.

Brainiac makes an appearance on the episode ""Brainchild"" about Cyborg being captured and used in Brainiac's experiment. Brainiac has created a giant robot and implanted Cyborg's mind into it.

In the weird episode, ""The Bizarro Super Powers Team"", we do get to hear William Woodson's voice narrating the opening sequence...telling us about the square planet known as Bizarro World...but he isn't heard again throughout the episode. This episode is 15 minutes in length as well. Bizarro turns several of the hero's into Bizarro's...ironically, Superman doesn't make an appearance in this episode although Bizarro is the insane duplicate of Superman.

Cyborg is introduced in the first episode, ""The Seeds of Doom"", as a reluctant super-hero who ultimately becomes one of the Superfriends by the end of the episode. Lex Luthor appears in this episode as does Darkseid. Cyborg is played in the first few episodes as a renegade of sorts...but he strikes up a friendship with Ronald Raymond/Firestorm.

One of the most recalled episodes from this series is the final episode, ""The Death of Superman""...a wonderful episode! This is a great installment of the series...which turned out to be it's last.",1194393600,8,3728,5.108374384236453
2909481,3,B000TSTEJG,"I have kinda lukewarm feelings about this one.  I watched all the incarnations of Superfriends in the 70's and 80's, so I'll just tell you what I think was good and not-so-good about Galactic Guardians:

GOOD: Firestorm.  A unique character with cool powers (was there anything he COULDN'T do?).
NOT-SO-GOOD: Cyborg.  Nothing wrong with the character per se, but he was used for too much comic relief.  For modern-day Justice League fans, think of Flash but not funny.  At all.
GOOD: The use of ongoing villains like Darkseid, foreshadowing the Superman and JL stuff that would come 15-20 years later.
NOT-SO-GOOD: Bizarro Planet. Ugh...I just can't talk about it.
GOOD: No more Wonder Twins, Zan and Jayna or other insipid kid-friendly sidekicks.
NOT-SO-GOOD: Adam West as Batman.  Sorry, but it's impossible for me to hear that voice in a reasonably serious adaptation of Batman without thinking of the campy, crappy 60's t.v. series.
GOOD: Better animation all-around.  It's nice to see Superman with muscles without having him looked pissed-off like he started to look in comics around 1990.
GOOD: Some stories focus on only 2 or 3 characters at a time, instead of trying to cram everyone into the action.  Best example is the Batman origin story ""The Fear.""  This is something the latter-day Justice League accomplished in spite of horribly cheap animation.

Well, you can see the Good outweighs the Not-So-Good.  And if you're a fan, you may not be bothered by any of the stuff I mentioned.  For anyone who grew up in the seventies, ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" remains the all-time best incarnation.  But there's still plenty to hold your interest here.  Recommended for fans; casual viewers may want to rent first.",1193184000,7,1725,5.003508771929824
