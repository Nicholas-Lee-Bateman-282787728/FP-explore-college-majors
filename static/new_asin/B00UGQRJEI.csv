8726675,5,B00UGQRJEI,"Saw the movie in the theater when it was released & a couple times on video tape. Really enjoyed watching it again after all these years. We watched it at our annual Halloween party. None of the guests had seen the movie before. It was a hit & really great fun. The DVD is excellent & of course, so much better than the video.",1511049600,,326,4.109375
