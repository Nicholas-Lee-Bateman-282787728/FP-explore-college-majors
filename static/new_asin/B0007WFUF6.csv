8052809,5,B0007WFUF6,"Ancient Egypt and what it has to offer is amazing.  Just think, these people built wonders of the world with 5000 year old tools.  And, it appears that those who actually did the work were well taken care of vs. what we've heard in regards to them being slaves and ill treated.",1296950400,3,277,4.3076923076923075
8052810,3,B0007WFUF6,"This only good documentary lacks advanced 3D drawings, animations, and detailed schematics, and it relies too much on a direct talk to camera.  There are only a few comparisons presenting pyramids simultaneously.  The graphics is old-fashioned, and the style of whole production seems to be a bit dated.",1197763200,6,303,5.291666666666667
8052811,5,B0007WFUF6,"The program gives an excellent introduction to the evolution of Egyptian pyramids  from the mud-brick mounds called mastaba to the the Great Pyramid of Khufu on the Giza Plateau.  A good summary along wirh beautiful vidography and good graphics are given for each basic type.  Included is an interesting discussion of the origin of the pyramid shape. Alternate ideas on how the pyramids were built are given; however, those of Martin Isler are emphasized. There is also a segment on the Great Sphinx. Foremost among the on-camera experts is the well-known and respected Egyptologist Zahi Hawass.",1177200000,10,595,5.177083333333333
