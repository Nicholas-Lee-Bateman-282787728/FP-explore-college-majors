934724,5,6304852800,"Tai Chi Master is set in ancient China and follows 2 Shaolin monks through their training and eventual expulsion from the monastary. It is here where the real story begins as the two friends slowly drift apart following two paths, one a rebel and the other a cold iron fisted military leader. Paths cross, sparks fly and only the best Kung Fu survives. This is a great movie chocked full of Chi Gung Shaolin techniques and Tai Chi mastery. Grasshopper would have got his butt kicked.

934966,4,6304852800,"Had a great time watching this film just now. I saw this long ago when my friend recommended this movie.
It blew my mind. so that was on DVD. now on bluray it looks much much better.
it was like watching a whole new movie.

The action though lot of wirework is great. I recommend using subtitles when watching.
the dubbed english audio will make you cringe.

the main thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars is for some reason Dragon Dynasty MESSES WITH THE AUDIO . not in a good way
During the fight scenes, there will be a random chair that gets kicked or a stomp on a table, it IS MUCH LOUDER than the 40 punches kicks thrown during the fight lol

also i think this was Mandarin not Cantonese cuz the talking seems off & im sure thats not jet li's voice i heard on the DVD.

still great movie. too bad Dragon Dynasty once again had to goof up the audio.
they did the same with Jet Li Fist of Legend.",1422921600,,906,4.073033707865169

Enough said about how good the movie and Jet Li is. I read lots of grouses about the English dubbing and lack of the original language audio from the other reviewers. Hey, this version has the original Cantonese audio and with English subtitles. So all those previously disappointed fans, please get this edition from Dragon Dynasty.  Enjoy it , I certainly did!

I note that on the product page it does have a disclaimer saying the disc may not play in certain US-based Blu-ray players without modification, so beware. It's strange as this disc is Region 1",1411257600,4,750,4.717557251908397

935107,5,6304852800,"Surely one of the greatest martial arts movies ever made, showcasing Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh in two of the most exhilarating sword fighting sequences ever captured on film as well as one of the most brilliantly choreographed staff fighting scenes you are likely to encounter in the history of martial arts movies. However, be sure to choose the Cantonese version and enable the subtitles rather than the English version because the latter, as is the case with Iron Monkey and Fong Sai Yuk, has been adapted for English speaking audiences and hence is accompanied by musical scores tailored for Western audiences, which is less effective compared with the original score; coupled with the fact that there is no sound effects for the fight sequences, rendering the movie less exciting.

Tai Chi Master revolves around the story of two Shaolin monks who, having violated the rules of combat within the sacred monastery, find themselves being expelled, only to be victimized at the hands of the imperial guards, and witnessing the elder of the two yielding to the emperor in the hopes of securing himself better prospects for a career in the army; while the younger of the two, played by Jet Li, decides to stick by his principles and continues to fight the emperor and the imperial army.

Then, the elder of the two, in a ruthless bid at securing power and advancement for himself within the army, betrays Jet as he is considered to be one of the most sought after rebels along with his cohorts, among whom is the heroine played by Michelle Yeoh. This gives witness to one of the most ferocious and exhilarating fight scenes between Jet and his nemesis that sees Jet badly wounded by his elder and witnessing him descend into a state of mental disorder which Michelle tries hard to cure over an extended period of time to hardly any avail until Jet discovers the instruction manual for Tai Chi boxing, which gradually leads to his recovery and mastery of the formidable martial art.

The movie culminates in a climactic battle between Jet and his nemesis that witnesses the elder being defeated and impaled on a stake to overwhelming cheering from soldiers under his command as they were severely ill-treated by him during his stint as a general who subjected them to extremely harsh training that saw innumerable injured and dead.

This movie aptly showcases Jet Li's stupendous martial arts skills as well as Michelle Yeoh's excellent skills in wushu.",1390608000,,2451,4.870503597122302

935182,3,6304852800,"I was not as thrilled with this movie as I was with many others that Jet Li has starred in.  Though some have been a bit more or less hokey, some a bit more or less didactic one thing is undeniable Jet Li's martial arts ability.  The man is amazing",1362700800,,248,3.94
935183,5,6304852800,"I have been viewing numerous martial arts films lately trying to catch up on the many good films I had missed over the years.  This one (Tai Chi Master) came out in 1993 and it is nothing short of fantastic.  It stars the amazing Jet Li and the beautiful Michelle Yeoh.  Both of them are highly talented martial artists and actors.  I did not time the scenes but I would say that for every five minutes of dialogue there had to be another action packed fight scene that followed.

The story centers around two best friends who were martial arts students when they were young. They became bitter enemies later and went their separate separate ways.  One (Jet Li) becomes a Tai Chi master and has a good heart and uses his martial arts skills only for the good.  The previous friend, who is now the enemy, uses his martial arts skills only to destroy and kill.  He becomes an evil general who kills anyone (men, women, children) who gets in his way.  The acting of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh is superb in this film and you can see they work well together.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of martial arts films, especially Asian ones, where there are tons of fighting scenes and action, you will love this DVD.  This is one I will watch again and again.

935320,4,6304852800,"Tai Chi Master is a tongue-in-cheek film, but it still has the spirit a good martial arts flick needs in order to work. The movie has a great cast of characters headed by Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), and Chin Siu Ho (who also teamed up with Li in the awesome Fist of Legend). I like this movie a lot, but it's probably not a film to rent if you're checking out martial arts movies for the first time. The production values are a little rough, which becomes quite evident with the wire-fu acrobatics (as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Hero). There's also a lot of slapstick humor. Sometimes it's really funny but other times...well let's just say you'll be scratching your head more than once.

What I like best about Tai Chi Master is the friendship between Jun Bao (Li) and Tien Bao (Ho) which sits at the core of the film. Li and Ho have great chemistry, and it's no surprise they have worked together more than once. Jun and Tien become instant friends when they meet as children and find they share a deep fascination and dedication for the martial arts. Jun is a naive and disciplined, while Tien is mischievous and ambitious. As young men, they go out into the world and take wildly different paths which lead them into fundamental conflict with one another. The connection between the characters and the two male leads is what makes the film work.

The plot is good, yet still works in serving up lots of fight sequences. My only gripe there is that, with a star like Li, it's hard to understand why they went so over the top with some of the wire-fu. I'd have been much happier just watching Li do his thing without the effects. Wire-fu often requires too many slo-mos and cuts to work well in a movie that's a rough in the production department. A heavier focus on real fighting would have made the movie even stronger. I imagine part of the reason for the choice is that with the tongue-in-cheek tone, the action sequences needed to be a bit more cotton candy. Think an American action movie with their sometimes over-the-top stunts.

By the way, make sure you watch/buy the uncut international version with the option to watch in the original language with English subtitles. If you want dubbed English, you'll have the choice. I mention this because many martial arts movies are chopped and hacked for US audiences and sometimes a way to tell if you're getting something like that is that they don't offer Chinese with English subtitles as an option. I bought Dragon Dynasty's Special Collector's Edition of Tai Chi Master to ensure I got the real deal.",1292976000,,2598,4.606911447084233

935322,5,6304852800,"How awesome is TAI CHI MASTER? Answer: pretty damn awesome. Years ago, this was the first Jet Li movie I've ever seen and, from then on, Jet Li could do no wrong. Not even lesser stuff like MELTDOWN and UNLEASHED could diminish him in my eyes. You gaze at all those old folks practicing their boring tai chi at the park and it all seems far removed from the exhilarating brand of tai chi you see in this film. Jun Bao's tai chi absolutely takes liberties with practical cause and effect, but it's these over-the-top visual effects that popped my eyeballs out of their sockets.

Jun Bao (Jet Li) would eventually found the tai chi discipline, but before that he and his best friend Chin Bao were youths who grew up as Shaolin monks. Jun Bao and Chin Bao were inseparable, which meant that the troublemaking Chin Bao time and again got the well-behaved Jun Bao into all sorts of scrapes (most of them pretty funny). But one particularly nasty misadventure led to the two young martial artists being tossed out of the Shaolin temple. In the outside world, Chin Bao's ruthless ambition and Jun Bao's easygoing nature force them on separate paths. When they meet again, it's set in the backdrop of a rebellion rising up against a tyrannical government. They find themselves on opposing sides, Jun Bao now an underground rebel, Chin Bao a merciless warlord. Something's gotta give.

There are several elements which make this such a good viewing experience. Start with the acting, with all the principals turning in very good performances. Jet Li isn't as self-contained as he normally is in other films. He allows himself some chances to goof off and show more personality, with some really amusing results. I really enjoyed the extended sequence in which Jun Bao loses his mind. At one point, he even thinks a wooden post is his old master. Big things were planned for Chin Siu Ho, but I guess things never did pan out for him and he never did make it as a leading action star. Still, as Jet Li's foil, Chin Bao, there is a ferociousness and a dark intensity to him that raised anticipation for that big showdown between him and Jet. The story does a terrific job, though, of laying out the friendship between the two, so it does mean something when they become estranged and then, ultimately, the most bitter of enemies. Even when Chin Bao, in his craving for power, had passed the point of redemption, I still couldn't help but feel for the guy. The showdown between Chin Siu Ho and Jet Li is worth the wait.

Michelle Yeoh is spectacular and, as always, her kung fu is a match for the guys. Acting-wise, her best moment comes during her introduction as she hesitantly approaches the husband who'd abandoned her. Then comes her skirmish with her husband's new wife, in which you have got to see Michelle spin tables with her legs and feet. I am in awe of Michelle Yeoh, and she may be the most effortlessly convincing female kung fu fighter I've ever seen in cinema.

Even Fennie Yuen, who isn't a martial arts practitioner, learns her moves enough that she's able to sell her fight scenes. But a stunt double does all her flips and tumbles and more hazardous stuff.

Plenty of rousing fights in this one, even if, here and there, you can just... sort of... maybe... see that intrusive wire supporting this or that fighter. It's a treat seeing Jet Li and Chin Siu Ho undergo the harsh Shaolin training regimen and then apply it in their scuffles, and then see Jet Li's conversion to the more fluid, more internal tai chi style. And this being Jet Li, I could almost believe he can actually create a whirlpool of leaves just by moving his hands a certain way. I look at those old folks in the park with their tai chi routines and I shake my head. Sometimes reality punches you in the face.

I also like the bit, during the fight in the Shaolin temple, in which Jet indulges in impromptu monk surfing.

This Dragon Dynasty DVD release presents the movie in its Cantonese language with optional English sub-titles. The bonus stuff includes: the always informative audio commentary by the ever lurking Hong Kong Film Expert Bey Logan (probably the most fun bit of trivia he discloses is that Michelle Yeoh can drink anyone under the table; he claims that she has a hollow leg); an interview with actor Chin Siu Ho as he talks about his background and reminisces about his experiences in TAI CHI MASTER (00:20:14 minutes, with English sub-titles); a documentary exploring the art and roots of Tai Chi, shot on location in Chen Village, the birthplace of Tai Chi (00:14:55); Director Brett Ratner and Film Critic Elvis Mitchell offer their thoughts on Director Yuen Wo-ping; Director Brett Ratner and Film Critic Elvis Mitchell rave about Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (00:14:32); and the original home video trailer.",1278028800,3,4804,4.66469893742621

935327,5,6304852800,"As a fan of the genre, I have seen most of the great Kung Fu films dating back to the 1970s. This movie, until Jet Li's Hero came out, was my favorite Kung Fu film of all time.

As with most good Kung Fu films, this movie focuses not on the action. Instead, the movie focuses on human relationships between two lifelong friends who grow up together. One chooses power, wealth, and pleasure. The other chooses to maintain his chosen path as a monk. Their paths inevitably collide, leading to climatic Kung Fu fights between two of the best Shaolin pupils.

Although Jet Li's action sequences were great, it was his acting that made his performance stand out. Jet Li plays the role of a betrayed friend brilliantly. Jet Li looked genuinely sad when his friend joins the Army by making fool of himself to impress the Army leader. When his character becomes enlightened with the principles and forces of Tai Chi, Jet Li's facial expressions and movements also change.

When this movie was released in 1993, the action sequences were extraordinary. Now, they seem rather ordinary by today's standards. But there is plenty to enjoy. The Shaolin monk fight sequences in the temple still ranks as one of the best Kung Fu fight sequences of all time. The dual between Jet Li and his nemesis friend is also very cool. Their fight scene is made more interesting by the fact the one is slightly better than the other and the better one uses a dynamic power style that the other can't counter.  Both pleads to the other to join forces with them, leading to even more drama than otherwise seen in a Kung Fu action.

Please do yourself a favor and  watch ONLY the Chinese dubbed version with English subtitles. The English dubbed version of this version called ""Twin Dragons"" massacred the movie by using of terrible English dubbing and by removing most of the wonderful Chinese background music.  If you want to watch a Kung Fu film, you are far better off watching it in its original form with English subtitles.

935448,5,6304852800,"for those of you who don't want the americanized version of 'the tai chi master' (aka 'twin warriors'-- ugh! i hate this title!), i have found an alternative.

i recently purchased the original chinese language, english subtitled version of 'the tai chi master' from a site named chinesetapes.com for only $12.95 (not counting shipping). it's distributed thru a company named universe laser & video, which put out 2 of jet li's other films 'fong sai yuk I & II' (aka 'the legend I & II'-- hate that title as well) . i quickly opened the packaging, popped the disc in the player, pressed 'PLAY', and smiled, because this is what you get:

you get a very clean transfer of the film, some specks here and there but nothing to complain about; it's a step above my vhs copy. it is in the widescreen format and the subtitles are a digitized white on the screen.

the sound is also decent. it's in dolby digital with 5.1 surround . the two languages are cantonese and mandarin.

you also have your choice of 3 subtitles: traditional or simplified chinese and english. the opening theme song is even subtitled, which wasn't in my vhs copy.

not too many extras on this disc; only a trailer of this film plus 'fong sai yuk I & II'(which i also recommend getting from chinesetapes.com) and profiles of the actors.

the best part of this disc, however, is that it's region-free. it can play in any DVD player in the world!!

as for the film, we know the story. two shaolin monks go their separate ways: jet li joins the anti-government movement, chin siu ho climbs the ranks of the imperial army; he soon betrays his friend and the movement. our hero eventually learns the graceful and tranquil art of tai chi to defeat his now-barbaric foe. michelle yeoh assists jet in defeating the evil eunuch and his sister who rule the province. yuen woo ping delivers the terrific action with his fight choreography and tight direction.

However, as someone jokes that dubbing is the eighth sin, the dubbing in this movie, possibly to match the lip movement, has the script modified. The humor was lost, as well as the wisdom. I compared an Asian release with the US release: the script as well as the English subtitle are modified in the US release. I highly recommend this movie to you, except that it may be best to find the Asian release. I also checked that my Asian release has the English subtitle which is very close to what the actors and actresses say in Chinese. Also one thing about the US release is that the song is taken out from the movie. We usually accept a French song or Italian song in a foreign movie. How come we don't accept a Chinese song in a Chinese movie? The original Chinese song is very suited to the events of the movie. My advice remains: the Asian release of this movie probably can give you more enjoyment than the modified one.",1099094400,78,1059,4.170731707317073
935480,5,6304852800,"I loved this movie.

The fight scenes are simply incredible. they constitute an art-form in itself, brilliantly choreographed, very fast and furious. Although one criticism would be when they stretch the bounds of reality (eg when he kicks some barrels and they all land neatly one on the top of another). The atmosphere in the film is great too, with the costumes and scenery giving you the feeling you are in some long lost exotic pre-medieval world.

The plot is not as bad as some here are making out. It is not too sophisticated, involving at its heart a simple tale of betrayal corruption ambition and revenge between two former friends. But you don't watch the film to be dazzled by intelligent dialogue and intricate plots and twists, they always are a bonus mind you, but in this film they would probably just use up fighting time. Michelle Yeoh shows once again that she can act fairly well as well as fight.

All in all this is an excellent film for fans of (slightly) over the top martial arts films. Jet li's second best in my opinion.",1094947200,3,1048,4.593582887700535

Jet Li is fast and furious as usual and is met every step of the way by his soon to not be best friend Chin Siu Ho(Jing Wu master in Fist of Legend).  Loaded with weapons fights and fist flyin' brawls, Twin Warriors will feed your violence needs.  Adding to the action is Michelle Yeoh who is always ready to lay the smack down on any willing but unfortunate soul.

Superb fight choreography(Yuen Woo Ping), although a bit hard to swallow sometimes because of the high wire acts, keep each scene rolling up to the bloody end.  This film does get a bit cheesy during some of the comedic breaks, but if you like chinese made kung fu movies you will be used to it.  Some of it is actually funny.  Another thing, for a movie that is also known as Tai Chi Master there is not much Tai Chi in it(until the end), but it is made up for with many great fights along the way.

As for the DVD itself, it is widescreen but not anamorphic and the sound is in Dolby Digital 5.1.  Twin Warriors is a definite must own for your Jet Li collection and if you just like a good fight movie be sure to check this one out!",1090540800,4,1384,4.161654135338346

935507,5,6304852800,"If at all possible, get the original Chinese/subtitled version of this film under the name, Tai Chi Master.  The U.S. edit version, Twin Warriors, cuts out some short but apt scenes that lend extra continuity and humor to an already fine story.  The dubbed dialogue also dulls the storyline, foregoes some subtle humor and stunts some of the character development.  O.K., so the English subtitles often lay waste proper (English) grammar, spelling and word useage, but that's part of the charm of this type of movie. (Why don't Chinese producers hire proficient, English-as-a-first-language editors to do a final review of the subtitles?  I would be willing to do it part-time, for a modest stipend and free copies of the DVDs. :)

This film plays the classic elements of revenge, loyalty, betrayal, and the clearly emerging delineation, and struggle, between Good and Evil, quite well.  Admittedly, some of the wire-work is fantastic, but it adds to, not detracts from, the epic scale of the story.  Jet Li portrays the ""good guy"" extremely well, with Michelle Yeoh in a very good supporting role and contributing one of the movie's best one-on-one fight scenes.

I saw this film at the theaters almost ten years ago, when it was first released, and it is still on my personal, ""top 10"" list of the best kung-fu movies I've ever seen.",1037577600,30,1335,4.902222222222222
935508,2,6304852800,"If you want to see this movie, find the original version under Tai Chi Master, rather then this English dubbed version by Dimension/Disney. A regionless DVD of the original Tai Chi Master can easily be found on the Internet. The fight scenes are some of Jet Li and Yuen Woo Ping's best, and it has a strong story line unlike some other Jet movies. The only other Jet Li movies that have comparably good fight scenes are Once Upon A Time In China 2 and Fist of Legend. However, I am only giving this movie two stars because of what Disney has done to this movie in the US DVD.
 Having seen the original movie on video, I saw this DVD at Blockbuster and decided to rent it, thinking that a US DVD would be much higher quality than what I originally saw. Well, I was pretty wrong, I cannot even begin to imagine what they were thinking. Buying this version of the movie is equivalent to getting an incomplete movie. One of the worst changes comes in the music. Or should I say what music? The original movie had a very beautiful score, in fact it was so good that I bought the soundtrack for it and still regularly listen to it. In Disney's version, all the original music is removed, and scenes where there was music, there is either complete silence, or a very downplayed stereotypical sounding westernized version of oriental music. The is quite sad since the original music was very moving and accentuated the rhythm of the fight sequences perfectly.
 The original movie also had a strong storyline centered around the origin of Tai Chi, but Disney perhaps thinking that an American audience wouldn't understand this, decided to just capitalize off of Jet Li's name being attached to the movie. Much of the background and scenes relating to Tai Chi and its invention now have completely different dialogue. The changed emphasis in the storyline just makes Twin Warriors into a stereotypical plotless chop-socky movie.
 One of the biggest ways they reinforced the cheap Asian movie stereotype was through horrible dubbing. Some of the humor in the movie is more due to poor quality dubbing than the actual jokes. I'm sure some people prefer to watch dubbing in English, so that's usually fine by me as long as it's done decently or if there's a way to switch to the original language. And good voice dubbing can be done, this is Disney after all, known for its cartoons with great voice acting and musical talent. Unfortunately, this movie only has one audio track, the dubbed one. It's a DVD; there's no excuse to remove the original audio track, especially when you remove plot and story in a poor dub. This is what DVDs are for, the ability to choose between the original language and the dubbed language.
 Disney get only one think right, the picture quality. This version looks much sharper and cleaner than the original, although there are areas where a weird green lighting is noticeable due to whatever remastering that Disney did.
 The Tai Chi Master was one of Jet Li's best martial arts films, but Disney's rendition is plotless and empty. Twin Warriors simply keeps promoting the cheap, low budget, senseless, martial arts movie stereotype, throuh cheap, low budget, senseless editing. I highly encourage seeing the original movie, it is one Jet Li's best works, but stay away from this bastardized and incomplete version.",1022284800,2,3334,4.741379310344827

There are no twins in this movie, unless the Disney/Dimension people think that all Asian people look alike. Heck, the two main characters aren't even related!
The Disney/Dimension version of this is dubbed poorly (when has a Hong Kong movie been dubbed well?) and has a few minutes cut from it. Jet Li's original performance is really awesome and it is just unnecessary to sacrifice it for the mammerings of some two bit American voice over foolio.

Director Woo-ping Yuen loves to build structures for his actors to clamber around on, giving his films a multi-dimensional quality.  This one is no exception, from the looping sword fight on the wooden pyre to the final conflict on the rope platform.  The wooden pyre scene is especially frantic where the combatants move freely above, within, and below the structure, which itself shakes and morphs before your eyes. For the viewer, the overall effect is not simply looking at a stage prop, but feeling the textures and elemental qualities of the pyre.  No wonder the Wachowski brothers hired Woo-ping to choreograph their action scenes in ""The Matrix"".
My favorite line (a taunt to Jet Li):  ""Are you here to dance, or did you come to fight!?""...right before Jet Li delivers the holy hurt on him.
Just my gripes: the DVD format is treated like a cheapo knock-off from a video chop-shop.  The viewer is forced to watch two movie promos before getting to the film, during which no FF or menu selection is allowed!  I'm fine with the promos, but why force-feed the customer?  Also, no option is provided for the original Chinese w/English subtitles and music score.  (The dubbing is bearable though).
All in all, highly recommended for all fans of the genre.  I'll give 5 stars if this DVD is ever given the proper treatment it deserves.",1015891200,,1483,4.872509960159363

I'm not certain, but I think one of the martial arts whiz kids at the beginning of the movie is Sze-Man Tsang from Iron Monkey.  Unfortunately, I can't find much information on him to double-check.  In any case, the kung fu skills of the children are absolutely amazing, and if the story is more than a bit hokey, the movements more than make up for it.
Tai ji Zhang San Feng is a pretty basic tale of good versus evil with lots of assisted stunts.  You'll be able to tell which moves needed cables and ropes.  The movie also has more than its fair share of preposterous gore scenes, which made my sister run out of the room, ostensibly to hurl.

The spoken language on the DVD is in English (dubbed), compared with Chinese (Cantonese) with English subtitles on the VHS version.  Sadly some of the translation is lost in the English DVD version -- it looks like they made an effort to match the words with the mouths moving, so the translation has been adjusted to fit.  This was definately an attempt to help this movie appeal to a widestream English audience rather than just die-hard Hong Kong movie fans.
Dissapointingly the DVD version offers no subtitles or other audio options.  I would have liked to see at least the Cantonese soundtrack as well as the English, with English (and other language) subtitles as an option.

There were so  many fight scenes, there were probably more than 10(and they last for quite  a long time too). Some of them I think were put into the wrong places, it  looked like they just put in the fighting just to make the movie longer. I  don't mind the numerous fight scenes only if they are used well(Like in  Fong Sai Yuk). The story itself was actually pretty good, it's about 2 best  friends later on turned into adversaries. There were some classic parts  where the fights took place, they look really cool and realistic even  thought it's on wires. However, this movie was given a lot of good reviews.  It will probably grow on me as I watch it again.",965779200,,798,4.26
935583,5,6304852800,"Though I haven't seen this dubbed re-released version, the original Hong  Kong version titled Tai Chi Master is one of my all time favorites.  It is  essential veiwing for any Jet Li fan.  Not only are the fight sequences  numerous, each one is absolutely epic.  If super-hero syle fighting is you  thing, you will enjoy this. The people who made The Matrix have seen this  video, and so should you.",965347200,,399,4.6
935584,5,6304852800,"Great movie. See ""Twin Warriors"" which is the English dubbed  version of this movie since Tai Chi Master is not readily available.",965174400,,130,4.909090909090909
935585,5,6304852800,This movie was great!  Good dubbing (a rarity!) and fights.  My only complaint is the relatively simple plot and some boring filler.  BUY THIS MOVIE!  You won't regret it!,964915200,,171,4.793103448275862
935586,4,6304852800,"This is one of the best martial arts movies I've seen. The group fight seens were fabulous. However, it is not typical of real life, although that makes it more interesting. It's definitely worth seeing if you like these  kind of movies. I highly recommend it.",963532800,,260,4.6521739130434785
935587,5,6304852800,"Out of the Jet Li movies that I've seen (Fist of Legend, Romeo Must Die, The Enforcer, The Black Mask), this movie ranks with Fist of Legend as my personal favorites. The fight scenes were just incredible... and fantastic,  in both senses of the word, which leads to this disclaimer: get ready for  some unrealistic fight scenes. You will see things that are totally  impossible, and if you want to enjoy the movie, don't go in with a critical  mind. Just enjoy what the movie has to offer, which is incredible fighting.  For those of you who would like a more realistic film, watch Fist of  Legend. That movie is also incredible, minus the floating, etc. Enjoy",963187200,,661,4.6068376068376065
935588,4,6304852800,"--I've only rented this movie. But If I bought it, it would be because of the beginning character developement and the comedy. And I'm only addressing the non-martial arts aspects. Wait till you see the action.  --Jet Li and his best friend grow up together training with the monks. They  later get kicked out and proceed into the rest of the world, and later meet  again for the final fight. But this time Jet Li knows the tao and easily  defeats him.  --The martial arts fight sequences are top-noche and I think  you'll find yourself laughing and amazed at the same time --It lost a star  because they go a little overboard with wires, but go rent it",963187200,2,653,4.483050847457627
935623,4,6304852800,"Another great Jet Li movie.  Bonus it has Michelle Yeoh and a couple other very noteworthy martial artists (Fanny Yeun and Chin Siu Ho).  Two young boys become monks Jet Li and Chin Siu Ho--at the Shaolin Temple. Jet Li is  kind-hearted; Chin is a bully who manipulates Jet. When they get kicked out  of the school they meet Fannie Yeun and Michelle Yeoh which are both  terrific in their fight scenes.  Jet and Chin soon part ways:  chin  pursuing power and Jet pursuing a happy go lucky life.  They both get  entangled in politics, Chin for the governor's lust for taxation and Jet  with the rebels who steal from the rich to give to the poor.  Chin's  betrayal drives Jet a little nuts but recovers to become a tai chi master  with a couple of awesome battles that follow. I really liked the fact that  the women were as great a fighters as the men.  The dubbing was not as bad  as some HK movies.  A really good movie with great fight scenes.",962409600,2,946,4.339080459770115
935624,1,6304852800,"I am really suprised that people actually like this movie. Personally I have come to expect MUCH more out of Yuen Woo-Ping. Most all of the action was done with wires, so there was virtually NO hardcore Martial Arts action  (aka. Fists of Legend). Many people think that this is entertaining, but  personally I cannot see the enjoyment in it, in NO way does it display the  talent of Jet Li, and Michelle.
In Conclusion... if you are looking for  Harcore Martial Arts fighting, then look past this movie and go buy Fists  of Legend, Drunken Master, or even Who am I (last half). But if you don't  mind watching Jet Li bouncing around on his head like a human pogo stick  (literally), then you might want to check out this poor excuse for Martial  Arts cinema.",961977600,,759,4.489051094890511
935625,3,6304852800,"And that, aside from Fist of Legend, pretty much describes all the Jet Li English-language rereleases that have come out in the last little while.  Li is always watchable as an action star, but in Twin Warriors (also an  inaccurate title -- one which neglects the emphasis on Junbao's eventual  metamorphosis into Zhang Sanfeng, founder of the Wudang school) one begins  to see that he's been typecast quite a lot.  He tends to play the slightly  goofy, arrow-straight good guy.  As Lethal Weapon 4 shows, he's capable of  a much more complex persona.
The martial-arts sequences are wonderfully  staged; I just wish director Yuen Woo Ping could have restrained himself as  to the number of cliched trickeries.  By the fifth time Tienbao (Chin Siu  Hou) flies through the air or slides on the ground from an attack, I was  almost yawning.  Similarly, Yuen is riddled with his usual bad habits --  overly accelerated editing that often results in disorientation rather than  excitement; pacing that's mindlessly fast, resulting in zero dramatic  effect in all of the acting and writing elements.  So all we have left is  Jet Li's marvellous athleticism and not much more -- nothing close to the  nuances and emotional impact of Fist of Legend.  When you keep Yuen out of  arm's reach of the camera he functions much better (as in The Matrix).  As  a director, all he's good for is choreography -- just look at Chin Siu Hou,  so effective in Fist of Legend but a complete stereotype here.  And the  comedy is crude, a hit-or-miss affair.
Thank God Jet Li's advanced beyond  Yuen Woo Ping's limited hand.  With the more devilish of his hidden traits  beginning to reveal themselves alongside his jaw-dropping fighting ability  and screen charisma, Li is poised for greatness.",961545600,,1771,4.881756756756757
935626,4,6304852800,"This movie had alot of string affects and had humor, but the creativity of the director to pull this movie off was incredible.  The fight scene of Jet and Michelle will most definitely wow you.  The overall concept of this  movie is very good.  The only thing I find is the on DVD and VCD the  picture quality is not the great, but you will get into this movie.",960422400,,361,4.173913043478261
935627,5,6304852800,"I didn't recognize the title ""Twin Warriors""??? The U.S. version should leave it as ""The Taichi Master"" it's a far superior title. Anyway, this is a very good movie. Jet Li at his best with incredible wire work that makes all the fight scenes so mind blowing and amazingly enough, realistic. This is supposedly the story of how the art of tai chi got discovered by Cheng San- Feng, the man Jet Li portrays. Of course it has probably been sensationalized. Anyway it's a really good movie that is only slightly superior to his other movies of this kind (ie ""The Swordsman II""). So if you have seen ""The Swordsman II"" and liked it, you'll love ""The Tai Chi Master"". But if you havn't seen either one of these, I highly recommend them both.",959817600,,736,4.5
935628,5,6304852800,"Well ofcourse it's a masterpiece , it's Yuen Woo Ping and Jet li together!
There's not much to say really. Chin Siu Ho to my surprize proved to be a worthy adversary to Jet and even more. The choreography , as  expected , is near perfect , and is perfectly executed. you could count on  Woo Ping to create such a great story and to carry it out the way he  did.
If you have just enaugh money to by your last piece of bread or this  film-by this film. It's that good.",959731200,2,466,3.978494623655914
935629,5,6304852800,"This ranks up there as one of the 2 best jet li movies ever made. The other movie is Swordsmen 2 which is nothing short of a masterpiece and in my opinion can not be beaten by any American or Chinese Movie to date,there is  just too much put into that movie,but back to the Tai-Chi Master which  makes a valliant effort and displays the choreography skills of Yuen-woo  Ping like none of his other movies can. The story is also very good with  some comedy but alot of seriousness and the ultimate bad-guy which is jet's  child hood friend in the beginning of the movie but becomes corrupted after  they get kicked out of shaolin and he becomes obssesed with becoming a  powerful enuch after seeing the privelages they recieve and becomes willing  to do anything for power,and by the end of the movie becomes one of the  evilest and most memorable villans ever created in a film. In addition  Jet  learning Tai-Chi at the end to defeat Tienabo makes for one of the best  endings and fight scenes there is. This movie is very hard to come across  but if you ever find it you better grab it.",956793600,13,1088,4.38
