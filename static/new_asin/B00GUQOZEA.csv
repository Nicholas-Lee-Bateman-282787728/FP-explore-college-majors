6117940,5,B00GUQOZEA,"If you are an Anglophile and mystery lover, you will feast upon this intelligent whodunit and thriller set in 1952 in England. It opens with a particularly intriguing mystery. There has been a spate of murders of young women, and former Bletchley Park code breaker now housewife, Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin), thinks she detects a pattern.

She convinces her husband, who doesn't know of her past as a code breaker, to visit Scotland Yard with her to tell them that there is a victim they haven't discovered, based upon the pattern of the killer. When no victim turns up, and Scotland Yard dismisses her, Susan turns to three female code breakers with whom she worked at Bletchley Park during WWII, to see if they will contribute their formidable talents to preventing a future murder.

While there is trepidation at first, the quartet is on the scent of the killer, discerning patterns and predicting next steps. The joy of this series is in the distinct character of the four women, the synergy and chemistry they have together, the period details of architecture, autos, custom and fashion. You feel you are in the early 1950's with the ration cards, the male-female relationships, and the attitudes towards women and limited opportunities for them to use their mental prowess.

The set designer took the idea of code and patterns and replicated physical patterns in the setting which is really clever.  It's fun to look for these style notes. The production values of the show are fantastic. Love the actors who play the key roles: Anna Maxwell Martin (Susan), Rachael Stirling (Millie), Sophie Rundle (Lucy) and Julie Graham (Jean).

If you are looking for a smart, original and aesthetically textured British mystery, you may wish to watch these two series.",1432080000,2,1762,4.959322033898305

6117942,5,B00GUQOZEA,"The premise of ""Bletchley Circle"" is intriguing. Four women used to work as codebreakers back during WW II in Bletchley Park. Fast forward to the year 1952 - it has been several years since the war ended, and the four women have lost contact with each other. One in particular, Susan Gray (Anna Maxwell Martin who played the role of Bessie Higgins in North & South, Esther Summerson in Episode 1, and Sarah Burton in South Riding) is leading a rather quiet life with her husband (who has no inkling of her real job during the war) and her two young children. Susan is a highly intelligent woman and is obviously looking for something to do other than childminding and housekeeping. When a series of murders take place, all involving young women, Susan thinks she may be able to help the police in their investigations. Unfortunately, her attempt to help does not yield anything, and her husband, upset at his wife's apparent interest in the case, forbids her to pursue it. Susan then decides that she might stand a better chance at solving the murders if she could get her code-breaking colleagues back together again, and so the Bletchley Circle is born.

The other women in the circle are Millie (Rachael Stirling), Lucy (Sophie Rundle), and Jean (Julie Graham) and though initially skeptical and reluctant to get involved, another murder acts as the catalyst that brings the women back together. The show is engaging on many levels. The period details are credibly done and brings post-war England to life. Little things like the rationing of food in 1952 (food rationing continued till 1954) is well-depicted in the show and many more (such as fashion) that transport the viewer into the past. The four women make an interesting group of crime solvers. Each individual has a strength that lends itself to puzzling out the case. The dialogue and manner of interaction is also well depicted and I enjoyed the attention to details in each scene.

In Season 2, Alice Merren (Hattie Morahan) is on trial for murder and the girls from the Bletchley Circle must work against the clock to prove her innocence. This season, the girls also uncover corruption in the vice squad.

The women's journey towards solving the cases takes them into dark and menacing places and the show perfectly captures all the finer nuances of a good procedural.  This is a well made period crime drama that should appeal to fans of crime dramas and period productions. This DVD set is Region 2 so it will only play on multi-region DVD players.",1430611200,2,2517,4.792626728110599
6117943,5,B00GUQOZEA,"A great story is one that allows for viewer imagination, and combines a perfect balance of intrigue, suspense, and emotional tension. Great drama happens with excellent writing and brilliant acting!  The dialog and ""chemistry"" between characters makes for a smooth, interesting plot-this perfect blend will draw you close and touch you where you ""innocence"" lives. This series is a little gem that I wish would have continued...",1429228800,,428,5.388059701492537

6117962,5,B00GUQOZEA,"Loved seeing these four women come back alive after doing secret unacknowledged deciphering of Nazi codes during WW2. They were smart, gutsy, and gave new meaning to feminism.

8627665,5,B00GUQOZEA,"A good friend stayed with me during my recovery from an operation; we both enjoy British mysteries, and one of these started on TV during my convalescence.  Unfortunately, my friend would have to leave before the series completed.  So, I purchased these on Amazon, and we were both able to enjoy both series to the end before he had to leave. I am not a connoisseur of these sorts of things -- to me it's a story, could be a movie.  What I can say is that is was well written, well acted, and thoroughly engrossing.  If there had been several more stories in the series, I'd buy them, too.",1522108800,,589,4.327272727272727

8627672,5,B00GUQOZEA,"Really an excellent program on so many levels.

Ann Maxwell Martin is an amazing actress, and she conveys so much feeling and meaning without saying a word.  I don't know how she does it, without speaking or moving, managing to capture all of the conflicting emotions she feels in a moment and conveying them so clearly.

The music is great, and one of my favorite parts of the show.  Usually, you wait for the credits to be over so you can get on with a program, but I enjoy the opening visuals and music and wish it wouldn't end.

In the era of heroes with superpowers, it is refreshing to see five women using nothing but their brains, their knowledge, and their courage as people doubt them and dismiss them.  Their accomplishments are at once amazing and believable.

That a program like this could even be made is astonishing, if you think about it.  Where do they find all the old buildings and cars that look just like they did 70 years ago?  It is a program you want to watch all at once, quickly, to find out what happened, but then you want to watch it again to see the cars and objects and furniture.  The typewriters and the decryption equipment are especially wonderful to see in action.

The photography is excellent, without calling attention to itself.  Everything is clear and precise and beautiful, but it just shows the actors and the wonderful sets without breaking you out of the story to think that the photographer was really working hard to do something unusual.

This series bears repeated viewings without getting clunky.  With other programs that I've watched multiple times, I find myself cringing at a scene that worked okay the first time but feels forced or embarrassing the second or third time you watch it.  The Bletchley Circle improves with each viewing as you absorb the characters and notice new details and connections.",1502841600,,1859,4.676923076923077
