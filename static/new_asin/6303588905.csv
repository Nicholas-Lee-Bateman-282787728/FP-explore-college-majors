7851121,5,6303588905,"An absolutely fantabolous, compelling video. Honestly would give 10 stars if I could. Literally SHOOK at how much I learned from this. Dont let the fact that this is actually a VHS tape distract you from the fact that the dog in the video is MY PRESIDENT. Well worth the money. 11/10 would recommend to anyone and everyone.",1526256000,,323,4.586206896551724
7851122,1,6303588905,This video was used and it didn't work at all. It was all static and no sound. I do not recommend.,1400025600,,98,3.7142857142857144
7851123,5,6303588905,"My 5-year-old granddaughter absolutely loves all the ""See How They Grow"" tapes.  My mother had originally bought one or two titles for my children about 20-25 years ago.  My children loved them, but I didn't add to their library at the time.  Since my granddaughter has started watching them, I have bought every title I could find.  She sings the title song along with the tape and watches them repeatedly; she has memorized many of them.  They have given her a greater understanding of wildlife and pets and have enhanced her sense of wonder about the world at large.  When we bought her goldfish, she bought two that looked like ""Goldie"" and ""Redcap"" in the pets video and named them after their counterparts.  When we find bugs and worms outside we talk about their lifecycles and she treats them like treasured friends.  When a ""pet"" spider died, she was happy to know it was a ""mommy"" and left two egg sacks behind.  She found a perfect spot in one of our bushes to keep them until they hatch into little spiders.  The tapes all arived in very good condition and were as described by the vendors (or better).  They have provided us countless hours of entertainment.  Thank you.",1325289600,,1183,4.634615384615385
7851124,4,6303588905,"I use the rabbit section of this video when my preschoolers learn about rabbits. It is very age-appropriate, educational, and keeps the children's attention. Each animal section is only about 10 or so minutes long.",1305331200,,214,5.142857142857143
7851125,5,6303588905,"The ""See How they Grow"" series is very good. We own the whole series. My son enjoyed them all though preschool and elementary; learning all about animals and their lives. They are the step before the Eye Witness Videos (which are excellent!). Hope they continue to offer these as DVD's.",1171238400,,286,4.74

7851128,5,6303588905,"Great video that teaches the growth of animals from babies to adults.  In this video you will see pigs, cows, horses, and lambs.  My son loves this video and has learned a great deal.  It has a catchy tune that you will find yourself humming.  My son has even taken what he has learned about how babies eat and applied to his playing.",1122249600,,334,4.253968253968254
7851129,5,6303588905,"We checked out DK's ""See How They Grow: Farm Animals"" from our local library and bought ""See How They Grow: Pets"" shortly afterwards for our two children.  The music is fun and the dialogue is cute and non-patronizing.  We'd recommend them to anyone with toddler age children.",1012089600,2,276,4.851063829787234
7851130,5,6303588905,"The video ""Pond Animals"" is a fun, educational, easy-to-watch video for kids of all ages.  I have used it as a classroom resource for teaching life cycle units with 2nd and 3rd graders as well as playing it over and over  for my 3-year-old son.  The video is broken into 4 animal segments for  ducks, frogs, salamanders and dragonfly's.  The animals are shown in  semi-realistic habitats interacting with each other and other types of  animals.  Each segment is proceeded and ended with a brief animated  sequence depicting the animal's life cycle stages.  The overall video  quality is very good and uses great close up shots of eggs, larvae and  adult animals.  A super teaching tool for both parents and educators!",962150400,19,717,4.875
