1802938,5,B000078UJW,"I've been watching MASH as long as I can remember.  My Mom used to call me downstairs to watch it with her and I've been watching it ever since.  MASH on DVD is by far the best deal out there.  Not because of the price but because you get to watch each episode the way it was intended to be seen, the way I remember watching them.  It's amazing how much has been edited out to make room for commercials.  Each episode is uncut and unedited.  You now can see all the missing pieces.",1045353600,9,481,4.0638297872340425
1802939,5,B000078UJW,"Most of these DVD collections are a waste of time! Do we really need to see the first season of ""FRIENDS"" or ""THE SHEILD""? NOT ME! MASH is the series to collect! The episodes look amazing, the jokes  are still funny...switch OFF the ""LAUGH TRACK"" and enjoy! Now, if we could only get complete seasons of ""SEINFELD"" and ""MAUDE""...",1044835200,4,329,4.576271186440678
1802940,5,B000078UJW,"I totally agree with ""A VIEWER from Kentucky"", except that he says that he only plans on getting the first six seasons.  How ludicrous is that?  When a series of this caliber is released, you don't just buy half of it, you buy the whole set!  That's what makes it a ""COLLECTOR'S SET""!!...  I will get the entire eleven box sets because I am a TRUE FAN of the show. ""Kentucky"", you may want to re-think your strategy and help to do the series justice.  Buy them ALL! And don't forget that when ""Married, with Children"" is released in SEASON SETS, get those too!  I WILL!!...",1044748800,,573,4.3584905660377355
1802941,5,B000078UJW,"The stunning picture quality is only one positive part of this amazing series release on DVD.  The second aspect is the fact that the episodes are UN-CUT, allowing viewers to see sequences that haven't been seen since their original airdates. This also cleans up some severe jumps in the stories that local television stations were forced to make to allow more time for commercials in syndication.  The only problem (and this is minor) is that you have to go through several screens after each episode in order to see the next episode.  I wish that Fox would have added a ""Play All"" feature so you could go through and see more than one show at a time.",1043884800,8,652,4.555555555555555
1802942,5,B000078UJW,"What can I say about a TV series that is already great. This by far is one of the best seasons. The season opener starts right out with a big laugh in ""The General Flipped at Dawn"". This is the episode that won Harry Morgan an Emmy and the role of Col Potter. You must see his interaction with Klinger! Of course you see two more appearances of Col Flagg, the infamous CIA agent, who never leaves. This is also the season that has Trap and Hawk (with Radar's help) looking to have ribs delivered from Chicago. And what a great episode when Gen Macarthur decides to visit and Klinger dresses up as the Statue of Liberty and the General salutes him! The season ends in a with the leaving of Lt Col Henry Blake. I am sure to be happy when they release this season and can't wait for the others! They're all a must buy!!!",1043798400,8,817,4.210191082802548

1803077,5,B000078UJW,"Season 3 says annyeonghi gaseyo (Korean for goodbye) or sayonara to two of the main characters on M*A*S*H.  LtCol Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) gets his transfer in the final episode.  Trapper John (Wayne Rogers) is transferred out of the 4077th as well.  Stevenson's character was written out in such a way it was unlikely he would return.  Rogers' character was treated more or less the same way.

Overall Season 3 began to see complications of this dynamic cast.  Alan Alda's character Hawkeye Pierce, continues to become the lead character in what, according to Wayne Rogers, was supposed to have been more of a comedy duo with each getting equal share of the glory.  Such was not the case.

Regardless, MASH continued to take people's minds of the problems of the real world.  The Fall of Saigon, April 30, 1975, had yet to happen.  Vietnam, while the fighting much removed from the headlines, still existed and America wanted to take its collective mind of the horror of the previous years.  Likely, that's what made MASH such a success.",1402963200,2,1044,4.84180790960452

There are entire scenes I have never viewed before. What's more, you can turn off the stupid laugh track and hear more dialogue that was drowned out by the canned laughter. Viewing the show without the laugh track is also a very different experience - the humor and lighter moments become darker and more bittersweet. We Americans can finally see the show as its creators originally intended.",1388016000,,626,4.7
1803091,5,B000078UJW,"I bought this to fill out my MASH collection.  I initially didn't know if I would like this earlier season since I am a fan of the days after Wayne Rodgers left the show.  I had only seen a couple of the earlier shows and wasn't too impressed with the humor.  However, I was happily surprised.  Granted it has a definite different tone than the later episodes do, but in its fashion, it is also quite good.  I am glad I made the purchase!  Now I just need to get Season 2 to complete my collection!

On a side note, I was disappointed that the seller wasn't completely truthful about the condition of the dvd and its container online.  They stated that there wasn't any signs of damage or wear.  However, when I received the dvd, the front of plastic jacket on the outside of the dvd container had about 3-4 small tears that resembled tooth marks.  Small but obvious.

1803093,5,B000078UJW,"As a kid, I would watch this show with my dad and remembered how we would laugh and laugh and laugh. But following the departure of Stevenson and Rogers at the end of season 3, I noticed the laughs were occurring less and less. Finally, with the departure of Linville at the end of season 5, the laughs ceased. Many years later, I read where Stevenson or Rogers, one of them, didn't like how the show was slowly turning into the 'The Alan Alda Show'. So they left. Well, so did my dad and I. For us (and what has become an 'army' of folk), the M*A*S*H television show consisted of three seasons, running from September 17, 1972 and concluding on March 18, 1975. And those three seasons were absolutely wonderful.

Love Alan Alda but the show became hard to watch when he became ""super surgeon"".  My favorite episodes were Divided We Stand, Radar's Report ( especially the part when Frank bites Klingers neck thinking it was Margaret, then calls Klinger a pervert. Klinger responds with ""Pervert? Who bit who Major?"" Breaks me up everytime!) The Trial of Henry Blake, Deal Me Out (hilarious)  and A Smattering of Intelligence. All on Season 2. On Season 3 I enjoyed Rainbow Bridge, Iron Guts Kelly, Officer of the Day, Private Charles Lamb, The Consultant ( I liked Robert Alda in this episode. He was also in a later episode where his character was not as likeable. He had to deal with Super Surgeon Pierce, didn't care for that episode). I could go on...However I cannot bring myself to watch Abyssinia Henry. The last episode on Season 3.  Not yet. Yes, I've seen it before & yes, I know Henry dies. But with that episode ,  what made Mash.... Mash ...for me ended. It was a quality program later on also, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't the same when Henry & Trapper left.

Henry will always be the best colonel of the 4077th (even though Potter was very good) and the funniest character on the show.

1803156,5,B000078UJW,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THE REVIEW

The third season of ""MASH"" is the very best of the show's first three years, feeling more rounded, disciplined and mature than either of the previous two years.  The original main cast is back together in this Season Three set, though for the final time in the series.  McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers would both leave the series following this season.

""The General Flipped At Dawn"" kicks off the season in brilliant fashion, as guest star Harry Morgan plays General Bartford Hamilton Steele.  General Steele arrives at the 4077th to inspect the unit and inflict some of his own comic lunacy on the camp.  The character is a far cry from the Col. Sherman Potter character Mr. Morgan would bring to life on the show the following year, and Steele's effectiveness is a credit to Morgan's versatility.  As a final note on this episode, this is the only ""MASH"" show where McLean Stevenson and Harry Morgan appear together onscreen.  Another strong show from this third season is ""Aid Station,"" where Hawkeye, Margaret, and Klinger go to assist an aid station at another unit under heavy fire.  The power of this episode comes from the multifaceted bonding of a trio of characters who approach the war from different perspectives.  This is also one of the first episodes to depict realistic bombs and guns endangering the doctors. Other shows like ""Private Charles Lamb"" and ""Big Mac"" are played much more for laughs.

Also featuring the sad classic season finale ""Abyssinia, Henry,"" the third season of ""MASH"" powerfully changes the direction of the series as a whole.

P.S. For some reason, the episode ""Adam's Ribs""(another great one from this season) is listed in the main menu and the episode menu as ""Adam's Rib.""  Ironically, there's a depiction of a restaurant menu within the layout of the episode menu with the correct ""Adam's Ribs"" episode title.",1281139200,,1887,4.9335443037974684
1803157,5,B000078UJW,"This is the last season with Henry Blake and ""Trapper John"" McIntire.

This season contains some of the funniest episodes in MASH history:
Private Charles Lamb - A Greek Colonel shows his appreciation by throwing a dinner party and a lamb intended to be the main course is sent stateside to become Radar's new pet.

Rainbow Bridge - An agreement to exchange wounded soliders with the Chinese Army is the main story with Frank nearly defeats the purpose of the mission.

The General Flipped at Dawn Episode - Harry Morgan plays an eccentric General. Season 4 finds Morgan joining the cast as Henry Blake's replacement, colonel Sherman Potter.

Iron Guts Kelly - When a visiting General dies in Margaret's tent, Hawkeye and Trapper assist her. The general's aide plans to stage a more dramatic death in accordance with the general's reputation.

A Full Rich Day - Hawkeye narrates a tape redording to his father (dear dad) detailing what Trapper calls ""a well rounded day of insanity"". A missing Luxembourg Lieutenant, a mad Turkish soldier who speaks no English and an American GI holding the surgeons at gunpoint demanding that his seargant be treated first contributes to the madness.

1803170,5,B000078UJW,"The original cast was firmly established and this season gave the show's creative staff freedom to flesh out the characters and make use of jokes that were all the funnier because we already feel like we know these people.

In the Colonel Potter years - meaning the last eight years - we didn't get to see the Klinger that is in his fullest bloomers in this season.  If you were a MASH afficionado and you had the task of providing a one sentence biography of every character, wouldn't your description of Klinger HAVE to include ""Lebanese Corporal from Toledo who dressed like a woman in an attempt to have the Army declare him insane and sent home?""  This season benefits from the contrast between the two corporals - Klinger and Radar.  Radar, with his Nehi-drinking, teddy-bear hugging innocence and Klinger, wearing dresses that wouldn't have been out of place on Hollywood's Red Carpets.

The show never gives a good send-off to Wayne Rogers' character, Trapper John McIntyre.  Trapper and Hawkeye's relationship was always the centerpiece of the show, until Trapper leaves, replaced by B.J. Hunnicut (in the next season).

Lt Col Henry Blake leaves this season as well, and McClean Stevenson's final show ""Abyssinia Henry"" remains one of the most emotional of the entire eleven-year run.

There are several events in the show's history that remain emotional touchstones, but season three began to demonstrate the depth to which the creators could blend comedy and tragedy.

I will say that Amazon's DVD packaging is horrible these days. When I first started buying the series over a year ago, it came in a box. Now it comes in a padded envelope! That's nuts! I have returned many, many DVDs lately because they come crushed, the inner plastic holders broken, and the DVDs scratched.

1803179,4,B000078UJW,"MASH is one of my top 10 favorite TV Shows of all time and it is a joy to see the antics of these Mobile Army Surgical Hospital doctors.  I am not a big fan of seasons 1-3 because the characters seem to too cartoonish for me and story lines seem a little weak.  I guess the producers wanted to keep close to the movie which was a little on the corny side.  With these faults, the show remains a classic for all generation and the dialogue is rather simple to understand.  Season 3 finishes up the tone for the introduction part of the show to millions of viewers with the death of Lt. Col Henry Blake and Transfer of Capt. John McIntyre.

If I rated Films or TV Series based on whether I liked them, I would have rated the entire series a 5 or a 6, but I rarely do this.  Each episode is high quality and the sound is great.  They bring back the joy I originally had when I first saw them minus the commercials (which are really not that important.)  One problem exists the DVD itself dose not have a lot of features.  You can not ""play all"", there are no filmographies or even a list of the extra and cameos that made M*A*S*H one of the best shows.  It would have been more interesting to see where all those extras went off to do.

I highly recommend the series with these limitations.

The characters were a little too impressed with themselves and it probably should have ended after the 1977-78 season. As I've grown older, I have come to appreciate the significant contribution of Wayne Rogers' Trapper John more than I did at the time MASH was new. The same can be said for McLean Stevenson's Henry Blake. While Frank Burns represented the all too real country club type, who values a person not by the content of his character but by the contents of his bank account and by his position in the community, Larry Linville gave Frank just enough ridiculousness to allow me to enjoy the character's antics. Presented too soberly, Frank Burns would have been a loathsome character. I think that's quite a balancing act.",1171324800,,904,4.764331210191083

1803202,5,B000078UJW,"Mash was one classic sitcom that combined comic moments with the seriousness of war.  The third series had many classic episodes starting with the General Flipped at Dawn where Harry Morgan plays a lunie general.  Gosh the attempted trial scene was crazy. Quite interesting to see the future commander acting alongside McClean Stevenson.  Many interesting conflicts between Byrnes and Houlihan vs Trapper and Hawkeye.  However the relationships between the characters take a slight shift.  Hot Lips and Frank have a few clashes and its quite interesting to see Hot Lips drinking and having a good time with Trapper and Pierce when Frank walks in.

The McArthur episode is another standout as the whole camp is jumpy trying to prepare for the supreme commander.  But not Klinger as he wants that Section 8 anyway he can get it.  Colonel Blake is in stiches trying to act like a commander.  Good thing he has Radar.

1803203,4,B000078UJW,"The first three seasons of MASH were the absolute best.  Brilliantly satiric and hilarious, they outshone the later years, which were horribly preachy, incredibly sanctimonious (especially Hawkeye and BJ), politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  While this season is just as good, I have always taken issue with killing off Henry Blake at the end of this.  Reportedly, this was Alan Alda's idea, and only he knew about it.  When Radar comes into the OR to announce, no one else knew.  This was the beginning of the new, ""serious"" MASH, which to me was a collosal mistake.  And I've always felt that the killing of Blake was done for nothing other than cheap shock value.  It was completely out of tone with the series.  There was an episode where a journalist friend of Hawkeye's dies on the operating table, and it's handled with much more grace and humanity than any of the later episodes.  Quite often American shows and films will throw a shocking ending (or just kill someone off) for sport, not because it has something to do with the story.  The Simpsons episode where they kill off Maude Flanders was like that.  I always felt this way about Henry, that it was pointless to kill him off in such a stupid manner.  Yes, war is like that, but it just seemed to have no other purpose to it other than to shock.  It felt like a giant f--k you to the audience, and it didn't make me feel sad.

1803206,5,B000078UJW,"The success of the 1970 film ""MASH"", which was directed by Robert Altman, inspired the production of one of the most successful and longest running TV series of all time: ""M*A*S*H"".  While most of the main characters from the original film were portrayed in the TV series, only one of the film's actors reprised his role for the TV series: Gary Burghoff.  Like the film, the show was about the men and women working in a fictitious U.S. Army ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"" (or MASH unit) known as the 4077th during the Korean War in the early 1950's.  For the first three seasons, the U.S. Army personnel stationed at the 4077th included Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson, 1929-1996), Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville, 1939-2000), Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit), Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda), Capt. ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher, except for the first season pilot episode), Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) and Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr).

As in the film, the TV show often demonstrated a lack of respect for the U.S. military by portraying many of its officers as being inept and incompetent.  This was the formula used for Maj. Burns and Lt. Col. Henry Blake, but whereas Lt. Col. Blake had a very likeable personality, Maj. Burns wanted to see a more disciplined command and was often quite the little stool pigeon.  Also, while being married and regarding himself as being a devout Christian, Maj. Burns maintained a romantic affair with Maj. Houlihan.  (In the film, it was while Majors Burns & Houlihan were passionately kissing with the entire MASH unit listening to them that Maj. Houlihan earned the nickname ""Hot Lips"".)  Whereas in the film Maj. Burns (played originally by Robert Duvall) was whisked away in a straightjacket, in the show, this never occurs; but the film's two primary characters and pranksters, Captains Hawkeye Pierce (played originally by Donald Sutherland) and Trapper John McIntyre (played originally by Elliott Gould), were portrayed equally well in the TV show.  Though typically disrespectful of the Army, Hawkeye and Trapper were completely honest about themselves, which is probably the main reason why they despised the hypocritical Maj. Burns so much.  And, as in the film, they both found Maj. Houlihan particularly attractive, but weren't particularly friendly towards her because, like Maj. Burns, she wanted to see greater military discipline.  This often set Major Burns & Houlihan at odds with Hawkeye, Trapper and Lt. Col. Blake.  So, with the officers preoccupied, it was essentially up to the 4077's lowly company clerk, Radar, to keep things running smoothly; but even with the interesting personalities among the officers, the MASH 4077th had the best rate of survival for any wounded soldiers treated there.  Hawkeye was an especially gifted surgeon, as was Trapper; while Maj. Burns had probably barely made it through medical school.  Father Mulcahy was polite and helpful, but Cpl. Klinger's main objective was to get a ""Section 8"" from the U.S. Army so that he'd be discharged.  To get his precious ""Section 8"", Klinger wore women's dresses instead of his uniform.  As a side note, the only major character from the film that was not included in the TV series was another doctor named Capt. Augustus Bedford 'Duke' Forrest (played originally by Tom Skerritt).

The third season of ""M*A*S*H"" that aired between 1974 and 1975 had the following 24 episodes:

1. ""The General Flipped at Dawn"". When crazy Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele (Harry Morgan, the future Col. Sherman T. Potter) pays a visit to the 4077th, Hawkeye must defend himself in a court martial with a song.

2. ""Rainbow Bridge"". Instead of traveling to Tokyo for some R&R, Hawkeye & Trapper join Frank, Radar and Klinger on a dangerous mission to a bridge to swap POW's with North Korean soldiers.

3. ""Officer of the Day"". The bumbling Col. Flagg (Edward Winter, 1937-2001) wants to take a wounded North Korean soldier for questioning, but officer of the day Hawkeye won't allow it in spite of the camp being in the temporary command of Frank & Margaret.

4. ""Iron Guts Kelly"". When General 'Iron Guts' Kelly (James Gregory, 1911-2002) dies in Margaret's tent, his assistant, Colonel Wortman (Keene Curtis, 1923-2002), insists on taking his body to the front for a more appropriate death in battle.

5. ""O.R."". With a huge number of wounded, Hawkeye massages a wounded soldier's heart while Maj. Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus) pays a visit.

6. ""Springtime"".  When Klinger's girlfriend in Toledo wants to marry him, Father Mulcahy performs a marriage ceremony over the radio.

7. ""Check-Up"". When Trapper gets an ulcer, he thinks it's his ticket home; but it doesn't work out that way.

8. ""Life With Father"". Father Mulcahy performs a brist for the Korean-born son of a G.I. over the objections of Frank & Margaret while Henry worries about his wife back at home.

9. ""Alcoholics Unanimous"".  When Henry goes to Tokyo, Frank is put in charge and denies alcohol to all 4077th personnel, but that won't necessarily stop Hawkeye, Trapper or even Margaret.

10. ""There is Nothing Like a Nurse"". The men go a bit stir-crazy when the nurses are ordered to evacuate, but an interesting home film of Frank's turns up.

11. ""Adam's Ribs"". Hawkeye is determined to get a take-out order of ribs from a Chicago restaurant named Adam's Ribs.

12. ""A Full Rich Day"". Hawkeye writes to his dad about various things going on in camp.

13. ""Mad Dogs and Servicemen"". When Radar gets bitten by a stray dog, he may have to undergo a painful series of rabies shots.

14. ""Private Charles Lamb"". When a Greek officer decides to reward the 4077th with a feast for taking care of his wounded men, Radar doesn't want the lamb that the officer sends to become dinner.

15. ""Bombed"". When the 4077th comes under fire and is inundated with wounded, Frank proposes to Margaret.

16. ""Bulletin Board"".  Henry delivers a lecture in which Hawkeye & Trapper heckle him, and everyone enjoys a cookout with orphaned Korean children.

17. ""The Consultant"".  When Dr. Borelli (Robert Alda, 1914-1986) pays a visit to the 4077th to demonstrate a new surgical technique, his drinking problem is revealed again to Hawkeye.

18. ""House Arrest"".  After Hawkeye hits Frank, Frank presses charges; but Frank gets charges against himself when the woman (Mary Wickes, 1910-1995) who comes to investigate his claims accuses Frank of rape.

19. ""Aid Station"". Hawkeye, Margaret & Klinger come under fire after volunteering to work at an aid station on the front lines.

20. ""Love and Marriage"". Hawkeye & Trapper step in to prevent a GI from marrying a Korean girl that has TB.

21. ""Big Mac"". The camp goes nuts in trying to prepare for a visit from General Douglas MacArthur.

22. ""Payday"". When Frank buys two sets of pearls (a good strand and a cheap imitation), he gives one to Margaret; but she really wants the real strand for herself.

23. ""White Gold"". Col. Flagg shows up again, this time demanding penicillin to barter with.

24. ""Abyssinia, Henry"". Perhaps the most emotional ""M*A*S*H"" episode of all, Henry dies while en route to go back home to the states.  This also turns out to be the final episode with Trapper.

Overall, I rate the third season of ""M*A*S*H"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  In its eleven years of production, ""M*A*S*H"" was one of the best TV shows of its day and remains one of the best TV shows of all time.",1129939200,35,7575,4.9549050632911396

Season Three offers a wealth of classic episodes, including ""The General Flipped at Dawn,"" ""Adam's Ribs,"" ""Private Charles Lamb,"" ""Big Mac"" and ""Abyssinia, Henry."" Though the departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers did not affect the show's longevity, the serio-comic tone was notably altered with the addition of Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell to the ensemble.

1803208,5,B000078UJW,"Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...

The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...

Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...

The MASH (Season 3) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""The General Flipped at Dawn"" in which the MASH unit is visited by Major General Bartford Steele who, through his various actions, is perceived to be mentally insane. When Pierce goes over Steele's head in the transfer of a medical patient, Steele orders a court martial, but Pierce is cleared when it becomes obvious that Steele is a mental case... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Iron Guts Kelly"" in which a recently expired general is smuggled to the front lines where he would've preferred to have died, and ""Aid Station"" in which Hawkeye, Houlihan, and Klinger bond while at the front and develop a new respect for one another...

1803209,5,B000078UJW,"I simply love M*A*S*H!  I am so overjoyed at having it on DVD!

For the episodes themselves, M*A*S*H has never been better, more convenient, and funnier (thanks to long edited scenes rarely seen in syndicated TV)! If you've only seen M*A*S*H in syndication, by this set and hold on to your sides. They may just split from laughing!

Many of us have never seen M*A*S*H episodes unedited, or it has been nearly 20 years since we have. That is the allure of this (and future) sets of M*A*S*H on DVD.

The big draw of DVD's, in addition to the Sound and Picture Quality, are the ""Extras"". Other than the ability to take out the laugh tracks (Yes!), this has none. There are no cast interviews, no bloopers, no Director's/Producers/Writers Commentary, not even Cast Biographies. Even the insert is rather plan and has nothing extra to it. The episode description look as though they were written by some one who hadn't even watched the show. I was hoping for more when the DVD's came out. Like the book ""Complete Book of M*A*S*H"" was not complete in it's fullest sense by leaving out that which would have made it truly complete (the secondary story lines, etc.), this is not complete in the DVD's fullest sense...the extras we've all come to expect in them. In that respect I am disappointed. But I am not disappointed in having a whole season on only 3 DVD's! I am not disappointed in the quality of the sound and picture (much better than the Video's from Columbia House and the Broadcast versions).

This was both McLane Stevenson's and Wayne Rogers last season.  The scene where Radar says ""I have a message.. Lt Cl. Henry Blakes plane...was shot down over the Sea of Japan...it spun in...there were no survivors"" still sends chills down my spine nearly 30 years later!  What an awesome, but touching scene ...  Even ""Hotlips"" was crying!

My only other complaint is with their painfully slow release schedule of only two seasons per year.  At this rate, it's going to be the end of 2006 before the whole series is available.",1096761600,4,2025,4.662921348314606

Harry Morgan saying ""The irish were rotten Indian fighters"" and other lines. 2)A chorus of ""We want something else"" from the Adams Rib episode where we see Klinger and Rader sitting side by side humming and Burghoff laughng a bit. 3) Another bit with guest Harry Morgan saying ""My brother contacted Yellow fever during the digging of the Panama Canal."" Trap (Rogers) Says something like ""Well you should've called me sooner General"" and gets dry mouth saying it. 4) A breakout in laughter from Alda and Rogers while licking things in the ep where Radar saves the lamb's life.'",1089676800,,846,4.841379310344828
1803211,5,B000078UJW,"Some consider the third season the show's very best, full of humor but also more boldly playing with serious topics. The actors are really at home in their characters by this point, and the audience knows them inside and out, too. They no longer need to play gags over-the-top to work because we know them so well. And because we know they so well, the serious turns hit home.
Reams have been written about M.A.S.H.; offering accolades would just be repeating what has been said before. Among the most popular sitcoms ever made, the show still stands the test of time despite being a ""period"" show. The jokes still work, the characters are still charming and feel like old friends, and the show still more enjoyable than most of the shows that have come and gone since.
Like the other sets, this DVD collection is bare bones (though not poorly produced). We get the episodes spread out over several discs in a sturdy triple-case and a small booklet with info on each episode. That's it. No extras. No commentaries. No documentaries. Just the episodes.
And that is just fine, because the episodes are great. Good picture far quality, good sound, and an option to turn off the laugh track are about all we really need.
Even better is the price. Because this is so bare bones, we're paying only about $35 rather than the $50 or $70 so common with TV-on-DVD sets.

There are a lot of standouts this season, including Hawkeye's craving for Adam's ribs, a supposedly dead soldier that comes back to life, General MacArthur's visit to the camp, and future cast member Harry Morgan's guest appearance as a crazy general. Two of the more serious episodes include a tension-filled prisoner exchange and a trip to an aid station at the front lines.
The one episode that most fans feel define this season is the season finale, where commanding officer Henry Blake goes home.  However, I think there might actually be another episode that impresses me more, the oft-underrated ""The Consultant."" Guest-starring Alan Alda's father, the story revolves around a consultng doctor who shows up to demostrate a new medical procedure, only to become too drunk to operate when the time comes. While the premise could sound like a comedic episode,  this is actually a very subtly done drama that shows MASH at its best. The lesson learned here is not one that gets shoved down the viewer's throats (like later MASH seasons), but is so deep yet understated that it'll take a rewind or two with the DVD remote to catch all the implications of the final scene.
By now it's obvious that each MASH season will be a bare-bones set, and maybe that's okay at least for the moment. Each set is affordable, the audio/video quality is above broadcast standards, and viewers can turn the laugh track off. For new and old fans alike, MASH season 3 is definitely a season to check out.",1081987200,5,1796,4.7165605095541405

1803214,3,B000078UJW,"Okay, I love M*A*S*H, and am delighted that the seasons are coming out on DVD. Season three is one of--if not the--best seasons in the entire series. The final episode with Henry Blake is a roller coaster of emotions and is really well done. It would have been nice if Trapper had gotten his own send off, but contract negotiations with Wayne Rogers sort of prohibited that from happening at the time. Anyway a great season nonetheless.
My big gripe is with the graphic designer doing these covers and inserts. I am a professional graphic designer, and must say, whoever did this cover needs to brush up on their Photoshop skills! First of all, Radar is much shorter than Henry, yet this cover has them appearing back-to-back as if they were the same height...it looks ridiculous! Second, the image of Henry is reversed so that he is saluting with the LEFT hand! Now, I know that Henry was not a regualr Army guy, but come on, not even Hawkeye would salute left handed. I was never in the military, but I know that major bit of army etiquette! Finally, and I've stated this before in a previous review...the United States flag in the Korean War HAD 48 STARS!!!!!!!!!! Every insert from these DVDs has an image of the 50 star American flag that didn't exist until 1960, seven years after the end of the war in Korea.
Ignorant, incompotent package designs aside...these DVD's are a joy to see and the ability to turn off the laugh track alone makes them worth adding to your collection. Enjoy and I only wish TV today could be half as good.",1073606400,6,1538,4.555956678700361

1803227,4,B000078UJW,"This review is for the production of Season 3 of the DVD Collector's Edition and not the series.
Maybe it was just me, but here's what happened.
Season 3 DVD set was originally purchased shortly after its release. It had a flaw. Disc 1, Episode 6 ""Springtime"", time about 2:50-2:58 skipped and locked up my DVD player; I couldn't even stop it or change discs, just eject it. I was able to finally exchange it for supposedly the same set. The new set does not have the problem. However, here's what I uncovered. The two sets have different disc labels for disc 1.
- Set #1: disc1 = Lt Col Blake (bad original)
- Set #2: disc1 = Cpl Klinger (good replacement)
Sorry. I can't remember the labels on discs 2 and 3 of the first set but I think there was no change. Too bad Blake came off because this was his last year in the series.
The rest of Season 3 DVD set is the same as for the first two.",1056326400,3,891,4.15606936416185
1803228,4,B000078UJW,"Yes, season three is the best, but only the best of the first three seasons. For me, MASH doesn't really get good until Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell come on. However, there are some great episodes during this season. My favorite is ""Adams Rib"" where Hawkeye goes crazy in his desire for take out ribs from Chicago. Once they figure out the rib place, they have to get them to Korea. One of the funniest MASH recurring characters, Cl. Flagg, makes an appearance in ""Officer of the Day,"" and later in ""White Gold."" Finally, Henry says goodbye in the last episode, a MASH classic.
I have all 3 seasons so far and working toward building a collection. But, at least for me, the five star seasons don't start until season 4, the best season of the series. I look forward to that release.",1055289600,2,783,4.4825174825174825
1803229,4,B000078UJW,"Well, this series of DVDs kicks off the 3rd season.  The characters become more rounded out.  The interaction quicker and more witty.  And most importantly, the characters have gelled in the minds of the writers.  In fact, this was the first season that Jamie Farr was offered a full time contract!!!  Before that, he was a ""day player"" and only made a few appearances.
Now, if you are a M*A*S*H fan, this should pose no surprises to you.  You probably already knew this.
So, for big fans you are asking yourself, what will I get by buying this?
The answer is simple: A concise collection of the 3rd season with each episode in its entirety.
For commercial reasons, there always seems to be a little missing from each episode, and these DVDs are able to ensure that the ENTIRE episode is delivered.
Now, understand that there are still no behind-the-scenes interviews or ""special features"", etc.  You will simply get 24 episodes with no interruptions (which is always better than having to watch them with commercials and having a few seconds cut out).
So, for you die-hards, I happily recommend this title, it is definitely worth the reasonable price.",1054771200,2,1152,4.787878787878788
1803230,5,B000078UJW,"Before Season 3 of ""M*A*S*H,"" producers Gene Reynold and Larry Gelbart had gathered anecdotes and firsthand observations at the 43rd Army Surgical Hospital in Korea (the 8055 was no longer mobile) which were worked into various episodes: going after wounded soldiers in enemy territory (""Rainbow Bridge""), dealing with a patient who is way too grateful (""Springtime""), operating while being shelled by your own side (""Bombed""), soldiers trying to marry local girls (""Love and Marriage"") and a visit from the commanding general himself (""Big Mac"").  As Gelbart later explained, it was difficult to come back from doing all those interviews and hear what things were really like during the Korean War and still be funny.  Fortunately, the show was still high in the ratings (finishing 5th for the 1974-75 season) and could now mix heavy material in with the comedy.
Ironically, Season 3 began with the first appearance of Harry Morgan on ""M*A*S*H"" (""The General Flipped at Dawn"") and ended with the final episode featuring Henry Blake (MacLean Stevenson) and Trapper John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) (""Abyssinia, Henry"").  In between were a couple of pivotal episodes that were moving the show along its progression from a rather traditional military situation comedy into televison's first dramedy.  There were still the military hijinks, with Hawkeye (Alan Alda) in charge of the camp (""Officer of the Day""), ordering take out food from Chicago (""Agam's Ribs), and making the mistake of trying to fix an error in his paycheck (""Payday"").  But there was also the classic episode ""O.R."", set entirely in the operating room and done without the show's annoying laughtrack.  The casualties never stop coming and even Sidney Freedman (Allan Arbus) has to help.  The stark realism of ""M*A*S*H"" was never more evident than on this stellar episode, and it set up the final fate of Henry Blake.
There was also the superb black comedy of ""Iron Guts Kelly, where a famous general (James Gregory) dies in the bed of Hot Lips Houlihan (Loretta Swit).  However, that is not heroic enough of a death for the general's aide (Keene Curtis).  However, this same season we saw even more signs that Hot Lips would eventually turn into Margaret.  In ""Aid Station,"" Hawkeye, Hot Lips, and Klinger (Jamie Farr) are sent to the front to work at a Battalion Aid Station and being under fire forges new respect for each other.  Similarly, Father Mulcahy (William Christopher) actually had something to do at times (""Life With Father""), and even if Radar will not stand up for himself he will defend the life of small animals (""Private Charles Lamb"").  This season both Hawkeye (""A Full, Rich Day"") and Trapper write letters home (""Bulletin Board""), providing vignettes centering around various activities at the 4077th.
One of the most sobering episodes was ""The Consultant,"" where visiting Dr. Borelli (Robert Alda) finds that being too close to the front in his third war is too much for his nerves.  Then there was ""There is Nothing Like a Nurse,"" where the nurses are evacuated when the enemy mounts as invasion.  Singer Loundon Wainwright III, best known for ""Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road,"" had a recurring supporting role during Season 3 and his best song pops up in this episode.  Then there was the finale with Henry Blake leaving for home.  Besides the stunning final scene in the O.R. in which the cast was given the script literally a minute before the scene was shot and where the raw emotion seen in the eyes of the cast is haunting, this episode had already reduced you to tears when Blake gives Radar a farewell hug.
However, there was a low point for the show during Season 3 as well.  In ""House Arrest"" Hawkeye decks Frank Burns (Larry Linville) during out of their stupid arguments and being held for court-martial.  The idea of the entire camp (except for Hot Lips) supporting Hawkeye over Frank has some nice moments, but this show has a horrible moment when a visiting female colonel (Mary Wickes) is caught in a compromising position with Frank by Hot Lips.  The colonel yells ""rape"" and Hawkeye quips ""A movie and a rape all in one night.""  This was one of those offensive rape jokes during the early years on ""M*A*S*H"" and I am surprised no one objected before it got on the air.
The shock of Henry Blake's death and the sudden departure of Wayne Rogers from the cast, ended up being blessings in disguise for ""M*A*S*H"".  No television show in history had as big a turnover in its cast and actually managed to get better as this series did in its fourth season.  But once Frank Burns was replaced with Charles Emerson Winchester, ""M*A*S*H"" would become sublime.  Rating Season 3 of ""M*A*S*H"" is slightly problematic because compared to what the show would be over the next several seasons these two-dozen episodes would be ranked a step below.  But compared to the vast majority of situation comedies that aired during the 1974-75 season this would be a five.  However, I will round up because of ""O.R."" and ""Abyssinia, Henry.""",1054684800,13,5029,4.895170789163722

Ferret-face is an all-around paranoid; just like I am when I get a visit from corporate inspectors. Klinger is like a combo of ""Animal House"" and Barbie- not that I wear dresses. Radar is, as Hawkeye once said, 'one of the boys who went home as men'. And Henry Blake is one of the most beloved characters in the series.
My only problem is that they had to kill off Henry. I don't think I'll ever understand why they did it unless I actually hear the reason from Alan Alda himself.

1803249,5,B000078UJW,"Something kept pushing me to continue to buy this series. I was actually dissappointed with the bulk of the first two seasons. The comedy was corn ball, and the drama was almost non existance. Season 3 is the Mash quality I remember... and I am only four episodes into this. I just viewed the episode ""Rainbow Bridge"" and it is stunningly better than anything in the first two seasons. The sheer writing and timing are perfect. Seasons 1 and 2 had their moments but they were few and far between, so far the first 4 eps. here I have viewed are so obviously better.
The inner booklet explains why. Before the 3rd season started the producers actually visited Korea, and the results are telling. The pace is better, it has a much more authentic air about it. The characters are more defined and the relationship lines are clearer. As a dvd set all three should be purchased on the principle of seeing the ""tag"" (endings) that were deleted from reruns years ago. This is about 1 or 2 mintues of footage that wraps up the show. How networks thought it was suitable to have shows with no true endings is beyond me. Mash isn't the only show to suffer this fate, but one of the few that truly benefit from it. In season 1, I believe it was, the tag actually showed the conclusion of a SHOW! Ending with Frank, Trap, and Hawkeye going off arm in arm. Something I thought I'd never see, but was worth the cost of the set just for that:)
My only true gripe is that for this being Henry Blakes finest hour, I would like to have seen the packaging more focused on the best commanding officer this series ever saw. He is on the front... but with Radar. And when you open the set, we are greeted with Klinger on the disc? I'm sorry but 30 years later and the Klinger character still isn't funny and has become one of my pet peeves. The packaging just seems to be done with little thought as to the content of what that particular season contains... Heck even on the binding we have... Radar? Funny thing is, it's just a very small photo of the cover shot with Henry. Shouldn't they have used Henry's picture on the binding? (Note, I love Radar, but this is the season of Henry!)
Ok, yes, there are no extras of any kind but Mash is like a family to me and I'm happy just to have them around. Something extra would be nice but like a good friend, having them close is enough. The final episode on this set is the best and most memorable episode of the series, maybe in history. RIP, Henry Blake.",1046995200,8,2480,4.335483870967742

 Season 3 is just as good as all the rest,one of my all time fav's ""Adams Rib's"" caps it off for me. Unfortunately its also the end of Henry. One of the saddest episodes in the history of MASH.
