a) Wealthy weirdos, who like it because they feel ""normal"" compared to Slim

b) Someone with a stolen credit card who wants to make an untraceable purchase by
  ordering something that no one would ever suspect them of buying",1336003200,,288,4.7

8217278,1,B000V8ZM9K,"I bought this in the hope that I could use it with my students to learn about the Iditarod as well as the state of Alaska while doing some excercises in the classroom.

The DVD doesn't even have anything about the state of Alaska on it!  And, the excercises for all 5 days are exactly the same!

Don't waste your money!  This DVD is a complete waste!

I tried to give it zero (0) stars but Amazon wouldn't let me do that, so I had to give it one star.",1294963200,2,451,3.966666666666667
