That off my chest, I will comment on the presentation.  The meager liner notes did not even provide the names of the singers, for which i had to google. Kudos to Gwendolyn Gillman as the female protagonist and to the handsome James Brown, the male protagonist, as well as other members of the cast.  Nothing wrong with their voices.  Kudos to the stage director, who compensated for the paucity of sets with colorful costumes.  Finally, kudos to the conductor David Laughton and the Stony Brook Opera Company. In reality a 3-.  Good enough for one viewing, not a second.  And by the way, why does it uncannily resemble ""Turandot""?",1457222400,,955,4.894409937888199

I saw the original production but it was even better on film - there are so many levels to appreciate this work, costumes, sets, and magnificent story, and the music is so well crafted and integrated into the story.  A must see.",1165536000,4,267,4.541666666666667
