2021419,5,B0001OGV7Q,I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.,1253577600,,190,4.457142857142857
2021420,1,B0001OGV7Q,"I expected more from this DVD. While there are lots of girls, the camera work isn't very good. If you can get this one for$5.00, then it may be worth it.",1196553600,5,153,3.967741935483871
2021421,3,B0001OGV7Q,"Ok I didn't think this DVD was very good. I don't know how the first person gave every match 9/10 and then said I wouldn't buy it again that makes no sense.

Joel Gertner was ok on the play by play. He had some energy and was excited about the matches. Hyatt did a terrible I mean TERRIBLE job. She was totally off topic, never talked about the match, (unless it was about how much she wanted to sleep with a wrestler) and was arguing with Joel non stop (No I don't mean this in a good way like JBL and Michael Cole).

The first match had one spot, that was it. Not one of trent's best matches 4/10.

2nd match was a women match where they really went at it 6/10.

3rd YAMAKAWA V.S. KANEMURA best match of the DVD it was great 8/10.

4th was a joke, the arena was dark and the light tubes where used so you couldn't see anything. TERRIBLE 1/10

5th ok match nothing out of the ordinary 5/10.

Yep that is it 5 matches. I paid $8 with shipping, and it wasn't worth it. 100's of other better DVD's",1167868800,,995,4.045918367346939
2021422,3,B0001OGV7Q,"I won't do a match by match since its been done already and I agree on their reviews, sufice to say I liked em all but wasn't overly blown off by any of em.

But what should have made this DVD special to buy would be in english comentary. Very much like the FMW ones by Tokyo Pop a few years back you could get much bether matches of the same promotion(in this case BJW) for cheaper but the apeal was to hear about the wrestlers, current storylines and the like as it was happening on screen.

Well the comentary on this disc did set it apart all rigth, as its freaking unbearable. I cant belive someone tougth Missy Hyat would make a good color comentator for japanese hardcore wrestling. Joel Gertner did his first play by play, he didn't knew the names of the moves and had trouble with the ones of the wrestlers but overal you could feel he was trying his hardest and wouldnt had been particularly bad had he not been dealing with the retarded tranny lookalike that is good ol missy. Missy went on and on about wanting to do Trent Acid, Screaming puppies over and over during the joshi match, counting the chairs used as if it was a sesame street episode and many many more anoying things. Basically what could have given an interesting angle for the disc to do well in retail ended up being its most unlikeable trait. go get some bootlegs of BJW instead.",1163462400,3,1359,4.346456692913386
8015446,1,B0001OGV7Q,Be warned that whose knows what kind of movie you will get. Mine was garbage beyond description....,1496361600,,99,4.882352941176471

8015449,5,B0001OGV7Q,"Otaru's life is pretty wild. As if having 3 Marionettes wasn't enough. Now he has 7! Faust has become put out with his Marionettes terrible cooking and their inability to act like normal people. He has sent Tiger, Panther, and Luchs to live with Otaru and his girls; hoping that they will learn not to be so inept. In addition to that, a new Marionette named Marine has shown up at Otaru's place. She has no memory, and has much to learn about living with humans as well. They soon realize that Marine is part of some bigger scheme by the president of New Texas. She may also be the key to saving the world from another disaster.

I had doubts about this OVA when I ordered it; but my doubts were soon cleared up when I began to watch. This OVA continues the 1st season pretty well. The animation is a big improvement, they story is as good as you could expect, and all the old characters are their usual selves. My 1 complaint is the English dub. Some of the, no, most of the voice actors are different. That is a good thing and a bad thing. Most of the new voice actors are easy to get used to. The new voice actor for Otaru isn't. It's the same person that they used for Kohta in Kanokon. Now Otaru sounds like a 8 year old boy instead of a grown man. It's really bad. Other than that, this OVA is great. I think that most fans of the 1st season will enjoy this 6 episode OVA.",1355529600,,1379,4.145522388059701
8015450,4,B0001OGV7Q,"Good matches on the whole. Some aren't really ""hardcore"" but are entertaining nonetheless.

Joel Gertner isn't that bad. He's not great, but I've heard far worse.

Missy Hyatt? Horrible, just horrible. Worse than the Hispanic announcer from XPW-- Yes, that bad.",1347235200,,261,5.341463414634147
8015451,2,B0001OGV7Q,"It doesn't take much to make a video with some class. This one has no class. They made it on what looks like a budget. If you want someting cheap after getting drunk them this video is for you. Keep looking for the video, because this is not it.",1345852800,,245,4.020408163265306
8015452,1,B0001OGV7Q,"There is no nudity in this dvd.
This is a music video, and some girls in swimsuits.
The customer tags seem to be misplaced.",1333152000,2,123,4.166666666666667
8015453,4,B0001OGV7Q,"If you liked the original, then you'll probably like this sequel; but it depends on what you really liked about it. In comparison, it drops a bit of the action-orientation in favor of more of it's ""predicament comedy"" flavor. If you haven't seen the original, I wouldn't judge the entire series with this as the basis of it.

If you want more SMJ action, try the other sequel; but if you just want to enjoy more of the zaniness, and don't mind a calmer plot, this one will be right up your alley.",1269475200,,496,4.333333333333333
8015454,1,B0001OGV7Q,Worst wrestling ever. I would expect more from the title but looks can be deceiving. WWE is more hardcore and thats pretty bad. I do not like a single match on here it is just plain out garbage. I do not recommend. If u want 2 see hardcore get czw or backyard wrestling,1263513600,,269,4.09433962264151
8015455,1,B0001OGV7Q,this dvd sucks it not what I thought it was going to be it just a doc about the porn business please save your money don't buy this dvd,1254096000,11,135,3.689655172413793
