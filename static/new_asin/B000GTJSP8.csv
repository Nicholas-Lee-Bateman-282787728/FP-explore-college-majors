8221505,4,B000GTJSP8,Jamaica Inn is missing from the DVD. However Captain Kidd and Long John Silvers Return to Treasure Island make it worth it. Charles Laughton as Captain Kidd is a classic. Robert Newton as Long John Silver in my book is as good as Johnny Depp or even better as a pirate. Even though Jamaica Inn is missing it is still worth owning. Don't think a lot of folks appreciate a lot of the old classics and actors.,1506470400,,406,4.285714285714286
