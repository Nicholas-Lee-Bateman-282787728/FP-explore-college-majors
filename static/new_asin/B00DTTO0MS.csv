8597631,5,B00DTTO0MS,"I bought this item ""used"" for less than 50$ but it was wrapped and brand new as far as I could tell. Super value!

This is AKB48 at their best! This set includes many hit singles from the peak years of the group before Atsuko Maeda graduated. From ""Everyday"" ""Sounds Good"" etc. Plus you get all of the ""coupling songs"" just as if you bought the CD-DVD combos. Plus you get a lot of the ""making of"" and interview segments.

Regular Japan DVDs will not play on an American Player but a Japan Blu-Ray WILL play on North American players. I have been enjoying it on my PS3.

It also came with the photo cards and the insert photo book. B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L !!!

If you are an American fan of AKB48, and you want a quick and easy collection of the great music videos from 2011-2013, this set is a MUST.
Enjoy!",1463097600,,801,4.28476821192053
