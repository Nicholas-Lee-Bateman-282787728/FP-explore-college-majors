8388630,5,B00353W21O,"The World of Bellydance and Al Dunia are two parts of the same program and both are absolutely first-rate entertainment.  Both these DVDs are a must for anybody who likes to watch belly dancing but they are also easily accessible and enjoyable for a general audience.  The dancing is excellent and the quality is even throughout  I enjoyed every one of these performances.

I was skeptical about these because they are stage performances and I was afraid they would be seen from too far away to capture the subtleties of really effective belly dance moves, but I was wrong.  The production values are absolutely first rate.  You get the sort of close-up feel of real cabaret kinds of performances.

There is a lot of warmth and spirit in these dances also  they are not stagey at all.  Anybody who has ever wondered why belly dancing has captured the hearts of numberless onlookers for centuries or how it goes about hypnotizing them can see it all here.  All of these performances are first rate, but anybody looking for one of those mesmerizing belly dance moments should have a look at Eleonora or Jillinas Sahlala Dancers in Al Dunia or Louchia or Rachel Brookmire or Rebecca Cardenas in The World of Bellydance.  And anybody wondering what makes lovers of belly dancing come back for more and more and more over the years should have a look at the last performance on The World of Bellydance, Denise doing Sahra Saidi.  The beauty of that dance doesnt come from just dancing.  Thats a beauty of spirit that comes from somewhere inside the dancer and just cant be contained.  That is a belly dance moment.",1420329600,,1609,4.7
8388631,5,B00353W21O,"I loved all the performances on the dvd. The performances are mostly cabaret style and the music is great. The production quality is excellent and performances are stellar! My favorites are Grinelly's Zay al Asal and Latifah's Aswan Dances/Drum solo.  I am a pro bellydancer and one of my favorite ways to grow as a dancer is simply watching great fellow dancers perform. It is actually a great way to learn if you are already a dancer. I also like the camera work---no crazy angles or anything. It is very similar to World of Bellydance<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-of-Bellydance/dp/B002M2Z3NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World of Bellydance</a>, which is also very good.",1293408000,3,725,5.839622641509434
