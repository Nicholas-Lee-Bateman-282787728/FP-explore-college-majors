8285203,4,B001BXTPJM,"No one does a biography like A&E, and this 100 minute program is the best on Ms. Minnelli so far.  However, please know that the above description is incorrect as there is NO interview footage with Beyonce Knowles, Martin Scorsese, Robert DeNiro OR Goldie Hawn.  However, there is some new footage in this updated version of the 2004 biography, including comments from Mary J. Blige and Alan Cummings, news footage of Liza's wedding to David Gest and one very short (maybe 5 seconds) clip of Liza commenting on Gest.  While it doesn't include as much as promised in the description, Liza purists may want to replace their 2004 version with this newer, updated one.",1234396800,5,664,4.807017543859649
8285204,5,B001BXTPJM,"I've been a huge fan of Liza Minnelli since 1975 when My cousin Kathy tuned me on to her .This bio is ""FANTASTIC.""I think there will never be a star as HUGE as Liza was in 1972 after ""Caberet""and ""Liza with a Z"".This Bio takes us before those events and after,and I'm sure there will be more with Liza's book coming out next year,and the huge TV comeback she has in the works.",1221436800,2,376,4.164383561643835
