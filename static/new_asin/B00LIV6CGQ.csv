6488092,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"I don't think people realize the gravity of what he did. This is truly an epic story and it played out in front of all of us. As a college cyclist and competitor, I followed Lance through every one of his Tours. Taped them so I could watch them later. His name should go down in history as a case study in psychopathy like Ponzi and Madoff. The expressions should be, ""You fell prey to an Armstrong scheme.""

Powerful video. Highly recommended.",1496793600,10,444,4.414634146341464

6488094,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"This film is obviously a must watch for anyone who's ever been a fan of cycling or Lance Armstrong. Where it is also relevant today, is for anyone looking into an extremely well presented profile into the psychology of a sociopath.  For those of you that lived through the Armstrong years, you felt the magic of Lance winning race after race, and like me, even after Lance's admission to doping, gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking, ""well everyone was doing it,"" or ""look what he did for the sport,"" or ""LiveStrong gave cancer victims support as well as hope.""  Whatever forgiveness that you as a viewer may still hold for Lance, could very well fall apart after this viewing. In my case, it did.

The makers of ""Stop at Nothing"", have whittled through hours of public footage to combine them with live interviews to present a seamless and concise narrative.  An achievement in film editing that will keep you listening the entire way through.  Looking back, what I never seemed to notice was the fierce denial by Armstrong to reporters over the years, threats to just about everyone, and other trademarks of pathological liars pointed out so well in this film. Think, ""Too big to fail,""  to get an idea of what Lance became. Featured are massive names in the world of cycling. Greg Lemond, Phil Liggett, Bob Roll, Tyler Hamilton, Floyd Landis as well as some of the names that came to be know along the way, such as Frankie and Betsey Andreau, and Emma O'Reilly (US Postal Team Masseuse).  Regardless of how you felt about the cycling environment at the time, perhaps like me you thought, ""everyone one doing it, Lance was still the best of the rest"".  Or maybe you thought, ""Lance brought a level of awareness to cancer through LiveStrong, than anyone before him."" You can't help but realize the extent of the damage Lance did to other people's lives along the way, destroying their credibility and reputations to protect his own.  Even in his ultimate moment of redemption, coming clean with Oprah, I realized for the first time Lance took a measured approach to minimize the damage to himself, at the expense of his own friends.

Was Lance a 7 time Tour de France Champion?  You can debate that until the end of time.  Was he a man, so obsessed with winning that he'd do anything in his power to do so?  Yes.  Through all of the emotions his story, whether you were watching from you living room or riding alongside him as a teammate, the ultimate satisfaction in this film is that truth prevails.  It may not happen over night but it does happen.",1495929600,32,2558,4.628318584070796
6488095,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"The stubborn facts NEVER go away!  Five stars for telling the truth.  L.A. is a bum who destroyed many people, why isn't he in jail?  I would like to tell a true story about a TRUE hero, Mr. Greg LeMond!  I saw him race in the Coors Classic in Estes Park, Colorado years ago along with Mr. Bernard Hinault back when the sport was pure as the wind driven snow.  It snowed  in Estes Park that day and they kept riding.  The men and women there that day were just fantastic!  Met some of them back at the Holiday Inn that day as well.  Here it was snowing and the people calling out the times played the Beach Boys song ""Surfing U.S.A."" At the end of the races (men & women) I'll never forget the announcer stating over the P.A. system....""There's nothing anything older than yesterday's hero""  wow!  A year or so later I headed up a St. Jude Bike-A-Thon....went on our local radio station and spoke of Mr. Greg LeMond who was my hero.  I told the listening audience that this was an event to raise money for children with cancer and that speed didn't matter just the laps and sponsors & all bike riders having fun! P.S. I believe Ms. Connie Carpenter and Mr. Greg LeMond shared the winners podium that year.

Allowing us to be completely obtuse, without remorse, develop a ""God Like"" existence and still sleep soundly at night. The cases of  Lance Armstrong was simply an extreme level. But, he was not the first to be exposed for wanting more and stopping at nothing to get it. He won't be the last.

6488105,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"Stop at nothing indeed!  This movie wisely covers the extent of Lance's pro cycling career.  While the doping and the cover-up started early, what is more eye-opening is Lance's ruthless behavior towards others close to him.  This movie has interview after interview with teammates and others in the cycling world that were intimidated and discredited for years.  Several of these cyclists used banned substances themselves.  In short, this movie is highly recommended for anyone interested in cycling.",1500163200,,502,5.467532467532467
6488106,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"A very well put together documentary. Subject matter moved along and interesting enough to keep your attention. To me Armstrong is the case study of why people need to heed Charles Barkley's advice years ago, ""I'm not a role model."" Look at the legions of blinded supporters in the background footage and how they blindly supported him. These athletes may be amazing at their sport but unless one has first hand dealings with the person who knows what they are like and what they are doing for that competitive edge.",1499990400,,516,4.7444444444444445

Fact is, our roided-up guy beat their roided-up guys.  That's an accomplishment.  That makes me proud as an America.  Heck, the guy was doing it to fight cancer.

6488113,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"One needs to separate this documentary from its subject matter.

As far as documentary goes, this one has all of the bells and whistles plus substance. The cameras are clear and take images at the right time. When bicyclists either are climbing, are stuck in traffic, or are riding near the Champs d'Elysee in Paris, the cameras are focused on them. Also, the documentary interviews of those involved in this great hoax are willing and unwillingly poignant, precise, and insightful. The off-the-camera interviewer asks sharp, crisp questions, which those willing to talk about this hoax come out and tell their tale, their side of the story.

Okay, enough with this hoax. In actuality, professional cycling in this country is about as popular as professional bowling. In Europe where the hoax took place, cycling there is as popular as baseball is here. Cycling is big in Europe. It's one of the top three big sports there: rugby, cycling, and soccer. Here is this country, cycling is not as popular. Way back when, bowling was a TV sport, and more popular than pro cycling here until Lance arrived on the scene. That's why I equate cycling in this country with bowling in populariy. Cycling is simply no big deal here.

 In Europe, it's a different story. Cycling fans travel for hundreds of miles to not only see the Tour de France, but also big races in Italy and Spain. Cycling is one of Europe's biggest money sports, and one of the most watched.

So I watched this interesting documentary with mixed emotions. Even though Lance Armstrong confessed to doping, he did make the sport popular here for several years. During his dominance, folks were walking around the neighborhood with yellow jerseys, and talking about Lance at local pubs. Once he confessed to his dope abuse, the popularity of the sport here decreased and went down in status to pro bowling.

 So it's a complicated matter when one talks about Lance here, and his adventures in the greatest bicycle race of all: the Tour de France.

If this documentary had one fault, it failed to talk about the cycling governing body's lack of strength to prosecute Lance immediately. They let the charade go on and on. And let him pass unsophicated dope testing.

I was in Europe in 2001 when Lance won his third Tour, and my relatives were talking about him doping. He went from a middle of the pack pro rider to the leader of the pack. He did it  in matter of several years. In his first four Tours, he only finished once, and that was in 21st place. Then he got that terrible sickness: Cancer. When he came back from that awful disease, he was unstoppable in racing. The Europeans had a good idea what was going on, yet they failed to do anything about it until he confessed to his doping.

Nonetheless, this documentary does tell a good story. The interviews with Betsy Andreu, and her bicycle riding husband, and teammate of Lance, Frankie Andreu are strong. So is Lance's masseur, Emma O'Reilly, interview strong. The story is told well through the documentary style of telling a strong visually.  Yet, this event is stranger than fiction.

 From 1999-2006, the Lance Armstrong story was a Fairy Tale. It was a hoax. The star character was a phony. And the viewer gets the sense of this bogus event by watching this documentary. This documentary shows how gullible, nave, and simple-minded tour fans were in this country. The Lance years was the years of the great hoax.

Nonetheless, the Europeans just erased him from the record books. And left those years blank. The Tour has been going on since 1904, stopping only for World War I and II, and will continue this year at the beginning of July. In the long haul, Lance was simply an asterisk in the European record book. And the Tour still goes on, strong as ever in Europe. In this country just as many are enthused about bowling, some are professional cycling fans. Nevertheless, it's not a major sport here.

As far as a documentary this is the second one I watched about the Lance Armstrong hoax. It was as insightful as the first one I had watched. Nonetheless, I enjoy watching the three-week bicycle race through the picturesque French country side and mountain tops. I watch the Tour today without thinking about the what happened over ten years ago. The race itself is far more interesting.",1498003200,2,4315,4.725699067909454

8666191,3,B00LIV6CGQ,"This is just my opinion, but I think the makers of this film skewed it to make Lance more of a villain than he actually was.

I am an ""extremely"" amateur athlete, (I commute to work) and I ""dope"" on a regular basis. I take L-Glutamine, which aids in recovery, and ibuprofen, which is a pain reliever/anti-inflammatory. Anyone who thinks a professional athlete can perform at maximum level without some sort of enhancement is totally wrong and/or delusional.

The film implies that Mr. Armstrong was doping during all of his major world class races, which would have been impossible since they regularly test for prohibited drugs. It would be extremely risky, and incredibly difficult to conceal.

Anyone who has ever been on cortisone or any kind of steroid knows that you can only take them for a very limited period or bad side effects begin to manifest. To think that Lance was on these drugs for 10 or 12 years is utterly ridiculous. The fact is he was a very driven and talented athlete who worked his ass off for years to become the best in the world. He was, and is a hero to many because of his dedication.

When you see the footage of him sprinting, and see the muscles in his legs (and in his entire body) you should know that that is not possible to achieve through drug use, but only through extremely hard work and training. If you don't believe me, try it yourself, and let me know how many endurance races you finish.

Lance was an amazing athlete who will be remembered for a long time, and this film will be forgotten by tomorrow.",1533168000,,1547,4.510714285714286

This was a man who didn't need to dope to naturally win from natural gifts and talent, and Lance Armstrong's petty, childish comments about him and Greg LeMond show is blatent contempt for true champions and others' natural abilities and hard work.",1532563200,,581,4.631067961165049

8666195,5,B00LIV6CGQ,"I've always enjoyed cycling and was good at it in my younger years, but I never did it professionally or seriously.  I will admit, though, that I admired Lance Armstrong for his dedication.  He survived cancer only to win the Tour de France several times.

However, I remember Floyd Landis telling the world that he was not the only doper, that Armstrong was guilty, too.  I remember the vicious count attacks by Armstrong toward Landis or anyone who questioned his integrity.  Something didn't seem right there with me.  French officials never stopped accusing Armstrong of being a doper.

So why was everyone complicit?  Because America was desperate for a hero.  We were at war in Iraq and Afghanistan and things weren't going so well.  There was cover up after cover up among the American officials on Armstrong's side.  Lance himself used his philanthropy toward cancer to convince everyone around him that he is giving back to the country by helping cancer victims.

Armstrong tried to destroy everyone in his path who accused him of doping.  He disparaged the women, he degraded the men.  When he got angry, he'd get these steel-piercing eyes and pressed lips.  This documentary shows it all.

This documentary interviews the people who knew Lance the best: his team mates, his friends, his mother and wives.  This documentary helped me understand how this epic fraud unraveled.

8666196,4,B00LIV6CGQ,"Just watched Stop at Nothing: The Lance Armstrong Story.

I'm 30 years old and have been watching Lance bike since 1998 when I was 10. It would be an understatement for me to say he was an important influence on my entire life. I fell in love with cycling, in part, because of Lance. Cycling, to this day, is my favorite and most freeing and pleasurable and bliss-inducing activity. I owe much of that to the inspiration I got from Lance as a 10 year old boy watching, mouths agape and lips ready to burst into shouting and smiling at his seemingly miraculous physical achievements...

I had a very debilitating illness as a child that stripped me of my motor skills, my ability to move at will and to even breathe. To me, seeing what Lance overcame with beating the odds against cancer, beating his competitors, being the best, I just fell in love. I was mesmerized. I wanted to bike and learn to fly like he so passionately, so beautifully, so powerfully did.

The truth about Lance, however, was that Lance was a willing monster of a human. The doctors, dopers, officials, government leaders, ex-presidents, other athletes who all were complicit with him, and who have yet to be named (Dr. Ferrari comes to mind), are equally corrupted. It's hard seeing one of your idols be displayed for who he really is. But it's cathartic too. The images we so carefully construct, the lies we so convincingly sell...the worst of which are the lies we have created that we willingly start to believe about ourselves. Wow.
