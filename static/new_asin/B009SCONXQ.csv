5362168,5,B009SCONXQ,Strike Back Season 2 is an excellent follow-up to a great first season.  The show kept me on the edge of my seat and had one surprise after the other.  The acting and writing were top notch and adding Rhona Mitra to the cast was the perfect choice as she brought the show to a whole new level.  I'm looking forward to watching the 3rd season.,1352505600,31,342,4.151515151515151
5362169,5,B009SCONXQ,Any hints on the release date? UK is releasing by November 5 on DVD only. Will appreciate any other information you may have.,1351296000,2,125,4.478260869565218
5362170,5,B009SCONXQ,"I watched this series on Cinemax this season and this show rocks.  After about 3 episodes I bought the 1st season.  It too rocks.  Lots of action, very entertaining and I recommend it highly if you like super secret, black bag ops type stuff.  I fully intend to buy the series on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out.  I'm am looking forward to season 3, I can't wait!",1350518400,3,363,4.202898550724638

5362175,2,B009SCONXQ,"What's up with the neverending stream of titties? How low class. How embarrassing for the writers, directors and producers that they can't create believable lust and romance without resorting to gratuitous skin and exploitation. Decent action though. Good thing there's a ten second fast forward button on the Amazon video player.",1509580800,,330,5.490196078431373
5362176,5,B009SCONXQ,"I gave this five stars because it's probably the funniest series I've ever watched. If you like clich, if you like predictability, and especially if you like to laughed out loud then this is the one for you. Comic book characters, writing that telegraph's, no shouts ""here I come"" and a pure unrealism that will have you rolling in the isles. Remember the old westerns where everybody shoots and only the ""good guys"" have silver bullets? Well, here it is come back to you from the past. The ""bad guys"" (hate that term) are black hatted and usually of the same skin color -- or at least with accents that leave no doubt -- and the good guys opposite. Seriously it's sooooo bad it's just funny, blood and all. C'mon suspend your need for realism and come on the blood stained, joy ride of your life. Like my old granny used to say; ""if you stick it out it's bound to get cut off."" Love and kisses, laughing guy.",1503878400,,909,4.384615384615385

5362181,3,B009SCONXQ,"The writing was much better in season 1. The sex scenes have lost the punch they had in season 1, now everything seems forced and formulaic. I hope the writers of this season were fired, or better yet , shot, before I get to season 3.",1499212800,,234,4.108695652173913
5362182,4,B009SCONXQ,"Started with a good plot and proceeded to ""screw"" it up, literally.  Seriously would someone be able to do his job let alone keep one if he spent this much time screwing every female he meets?  That got boring pdq  I watch to the end and with a little modification I might watch more but I'd like more intelligence and clever solutions and less horn dog action.  Lots of action, can't complain there.  I can't speak about military authenticity and personally I don't care.  I do want to like the heroes however and I'm not sure about these two.",1498348800,,544,4.444444444444445
5362183,5,B009SCONXQ,This is the coolest show on TV ever. Awesomeness upon awesomeness. These guys have great on screen chemistry. I was so disappointed when it went away. I just don't understand TV execs sometimes. Maybe the guys wanted out of the show fro some reason. I don't know. There really isn't anything else to meet the level of this show..NOTHING. I really can't go on enough about the guys though. They were absolute perfection in these roles.,1498003200,,434,4.723684210526316

5362187,3,B009SCONXQ,it has become old...after a while seems very low budget with a stereotypic undertone,1495756800,,84,5.071428571428571
5362188,4,B009SCONXQ,"Sex and killin people, then more sex and killin people, intersperse a little bit of episodical simple plot and a tiny bit of complex back story plot, and you'll have a hit.

My only complaint is sometimes the writing betrays their military consultant director and the cheese spreads.  Most of the time however, the military aspect is better and more believable than anything coming out of Hollywood these days.  You can tell the two lead actors care about learning the military technique. I want to see at least somewhat realistic action, and this fits that bill.  Great prop weapon armory, quick accurate shots, and proper CQB techniques, all make it fun to watch. I will say they fire full auto way too much, but I think that's just to ramp up the action.

Sometimes it can be kinda silly that the bad guys just murder their own constantly.  Any tiny infraction of a subordinate equals instant death, which is a hard punishment if you just put in 2 creams instead of 1 in the bosses coffee. It's a cheap way to villainize the antagonist, but that's not a deal breaker for me.",1494374400,5,1077,4.583333333333333
5362189,5,B009SCONXQ,"Amazing! I had never heard of this, and now I see it five years after, but it's still relevant. For anyone looking to be well entertained by a great pool of actors, then this is it. I don't really care whether the tactical portrayal is precise or even close because it's entertaining, suspensful, and has lots of hot action! Love the characters, and the plot. This should be a feature film.",1490918400,,390,4.507042253521127

5362193,2,B009SCONXQ,"Never ending, boring doom and gloom. Darkness, near continuous shooting for the sake of shooting, corpses piling up nearly non-stop. Then some sex and it's all over again - shooting for no reason, killing en masse. Then again. And again....Dumb script. Dumb action.",1488844800,,265,5.186046511627907

5362201,4,B009SCONXQ,I would give this series 5 stars if it had 0 sex scenes.  I personally think it is 100% unnecessary in this series.  I guess they use it for filler to take up the time. The writing each episode though is well done as is the acting.  Action scenes are solid and very well done for this level of production imho.,1486598400,,310,4.049180327868853

5362208,2,B009SCONXQ,"It's just silly at this point. The first season had some semblance of reality at the beginning then it devolved into one unrealistic ""fire fight"" after another peppered with unrealistic sexual scenarios. Then the writers try to get real by killing a central  character every 5th episode.  Show has drifted off by watching pattern as a result.",1486598400,,342,4.982456140350878

I love naked, beautiful women but this show throws in sex scenes just to throw them in. It's insulting.

All these things make it almost unbearable to watch. It's too bad because we need a good spec ops type TV show out there. It's too bad they insult the viewers intelligence on so many levels.",1485388800,5,597,4.418181818181818

Casual sex with all the co-workers and half of all government employees and top secret agencies heads go rogue and betray their country, friends and family for money and power. The more conservative and out spoken for values and helping our fellow man, the more likely they will be dirty rotten murderous scoundrels. This show takes a great well directed action movie that had to have been assisted by real combat shoulders because the gun fighting action moves forward in a way that real soldiers will act and do to stay alive and kill the enemy. The show would be great with just that and it's good storylines. If Hot naked bodies having all types of sexual encounters mixed in with killing terrorist is your type of intertainment?

After watching a helicopter sit on the ground for over 3 minutes and no one shoots the engine or tail on the ground, simple, no mess, no explosion. I watched with amusement and entertainment the situations they put themselves in due to pure stupidity and writers wanting action over common sense, so i have to stop watching, its too stupid.

The show started out far fetched enough but I am not going to wait as space aliens, as I am sure the writers will introduce at some point arrive to save the day and have angry alien sex (sarcasm) but you get the point. The stories are simply too stupid now and the entertainment value is gone. A few dumb plot lines are fine but two or three every episode is too much. couldn't watch anymore of the series, One and a half seasons was enough.

5362457,5,B009SCONXQ,"Read some info about this series. The actors trained with former SAS members, and it shows. The rigorous altitude training and weapons training, gives the series a more realistic look than typical action flicks or shows. Of course the main characters are almost like superheroes, but I watch this to escape reality. Even so there is a verisimilitude to Strike Back. The plot which takes ten episodes to play out is more complex than most shows. Highly recommended, binge worthy entertainment.",1482796800,,492,5.08641975308642

5362462,3,B009SCONXQ,"This is based on only watching seasons 1 & 2.  The show is entertaining if you like super heroes killing endless droves of brainless terrorists.  Season 2 had a fairly poor plot with the main villain, Conrad Knox, having possibly one of the dumbest reasons for wanting to nuke a city...

However, after watching 2 seasons, I find myself constantly asking myself the following:
1) How much did Ray Ban pay for the blatant nonstop product placement?
2) Does Damien Scott literally need to bang everything that moves?
3) Is it part of ""terrorist school"" to always run from a covered position to the middle of the room screaming and holding a AK waiting to get shot?

Despite the disappointing plot, if you like shoot outs, explosions, nudity, and swearing (like me) then this series is for you",1482710400,,790,4.702898550724638

5362610,5,B009SCONXQ,"These are not available in USA format dvd, and we are the worse for it. The cinematography is first rate, the production values are magnificent, the plots are better, and each show is a lush construction by masterful artists and engineers. Both actors are bang-on perfect in their roles. The support staff is also crackerjack masterful. THIS is what action movies should aspire to. Yes, the occasional bit of nudity, here and there, tastefully done, and with beautiful women (too bad, the excellent Amanda Mealing from Season One!).

Note the Section's ruthless focus on competence.

Jack Donovan observed, there is a difference between being a good man, and being good at being a man.

Most men are one or another, to one degree, or another.

These two are perfect at being both.

There is talk of a Strike Back movie.

  Have you ever watched a show where the good guys are 15 Feet from an exploding claymore ( devastating US anti-personnel mine) and don't get a scratch on them?
yeah well not this show.
1) Things always go sideways, just like in real life, nothing goes as planned.
2) Major characters do die. Evidently producers are vehemently opposed to the usual ""deus ex-machina"" that permeates
  the action space.

But I don't consider that to be a bad thing, and I think it is done very, very well.  Certainly entertaining, if you're willing to suspend disbelief.
I recently watched ""24"" for the first time, and I realized how much ""Strike Back"" has 'ruined' most action shows for me.  There is nothing I can think of that can match ""Strike Back"" for intensity, the chemistry between the main characters is great, and the main story threads are no less believable than any other preposterous action show on TV.",1473638400,,648,4.466101694915254

The actors are mostly unknown, but the acting and sets are excellent. The series is filmed in various countries which adds international intrigue to the plot.

Season 2 begins with the arrival of a new commander to replace Colonel Grant who was killed at the end of Season 1. She is not well received, especially by Scott, but  Section 20 operatives are gaining respect for her with each episode.

The two most active agents, Damien Scott, the American, and Philip Winchester (the Brit) are good looking and well suited to the role and each other.  The entire season focuses on one plot line involving much danger and nefarious enemies.  Good grief, don't see this kind of brutality on the standard American channels!  Those Brits don't mess about and they're not squeamish about killing people off either.  And, did I mention the sex?  Damien is always shown having sex with a number of nubile and willing women.  Boy, he is nice eye candy and he's fearless as well.  Sigh.",1471392000,2,681,4.703389830508475

There is also very little advance notice so you can't avoid them.  As prior service military I appreciate the relationships between the main characters - they are realistic.  However, just like almost all military TV shows, Strike Back has its fair share of technical inaccuracies.  Overall, we like the show but don't appreciate the sex scenes that we fast forward through.  They probably draw a certain demographic which is unfortunate.",1471392000,,553,5.032967032967033

First rate acting by all. The only draw back for me is the show's bombardment of gratuitous sex scenes that detract from the quality of the rest of the show. For those that want it, there are other venues for that content.

All in all, GREAT HARDCORE ACTION ENTERTAINMENT!

5363031,4,B009SCONXQ,"Strike Back returns to its high octane miliue, Sgt. Michael Stonbridge and Sgt. Damien Scott are on different paths and Section 20 is about to be disbanded. The series actors have great technical advisers which lets the action sequences ring true. One has to suspend belief during the fire fights since the bad guys can only score kills up close and personal while our Section 20 special operators can take out  hostiles at any distance; that said if your willing to sit back and enjoy this action series, you will understand why it was such a popular show. Scott and Stone are after nuclear triggers; a hunt that takes them round the world to various exotic locations ( which is another positive aspect of this series) The supporting characters are excellent with abundant roles for for strong females.( which all happen to be beautiful.) Hey! I did say that one had to suspend belief. Good use of the talents of Sgt. Julia Richmond ( Michelle Lukes) who this season gets to come out from behind the computers and utilize her deadly skills in taking down hostiles. One can only hope that she will survive to display her skills throughout series, this hard hitting series has more then once eliminated a central character. I can recommend this show but caution that the violence and the sex are explicit and  it often feels like a multiple shooter video game, still i haven't had so much fun this the ""Unit"" ended.",1470182400,,1414,4.69758064516129

White men with any kind of intelligence should find shows like this a personal embarrassment - like all they're good for is shooting at people, cardboard dialogue and seducing the same, flat female character over and over. The one star I gave the show goes to the landscapes - they were really beautiful and unique. Everything else points to a sad lack of imagination and intelligence.

And hey Cinemax, guess what? Not all MIddle Eastern and African people are fatalistic shouting people with machine guns. What a bunch of racist, sexist claptrap.",1468368000,,772,5.03125

What pulls you into the next episode is that the storyline of one episode leads into the next where it is resolved. But by that time it has started a new storyline which pulls you into the next!

Each one has a specific talent and role and contributes to the show as a whole. Throughout each season as I got attached to each character is was very difficult when one of them was killed. The plot each season was phenomenal and the deaths of main characters, though shocking and sad, was understandable and made sense to the overall storyline. The only thing I got tired of was all the sexual encounters for Damian Scott and the explicitness of the encounters. After the first season, it was obvious how Scott enjoyed women and they enjoyed him. It wasn't necessary to continue showing all of the encounters in such detail, in my opinion. Thanks for a great show! LOVED every minute of it!!",1466985600,,800,4.601398601398602

Scott and Stonebridge continue to be strong partners and incredible ""forces for good"" as members of Section 20. The ""villains of the piece"" are realistically human rather than stereotypes of evil. Charles Dance is all-too-believable, and while I may abhor his stated politics, he comes across as an incredibly honest man. He is no paper tiger, but is a man sincere in his beliefs.

The two main characters, Damien Scott and Michael Stonebridge are two tough believable gritty characters who always persevere through many difficult situations that are at times, almost impossible to survive.  They always have each other's backs.  Sometimes Sgt. Stonebridge is assisted by unlikely ally at the most dire situation.

5363710,5,B009SCONXQ,"Awesome!  Love the Africa-centric storyline and action.  Real world plots filmed in beautiful exotic places, thrusting the viewer into issues of arms dealing, ethnic cleansing, drugs, and terrorism.  Scott and Stonebridge make a great team, as we watch these two 'operators' continue to learn how to work together in pursuit of their target.  Even though this was produced by the BBC, and shown here in the States on Cinemax, I've noticed that the nudity and graphic sex of Season 1 has been toned down as Scott seems to have 'matured' and begun seeking out more meaningful relationships instead of bedding every woman he sees.  Or the show producers have switched their strategy, preferring to emphasis story.  Either way, the action is exciting and often unpredictable.  Can't wait to watch Season 3!",1463616000,,802,5.076335877862595

Plus, gotta love the fluidity of the plots in Strike Back unlike other (similar) series where sometimes you'd rather watch paint dry than lumber through the underlying plot line.  5 stars from the USA!",1463443200,,423,5.115942028985507

The production values are great. A lot of what appears to be location filming. The casting is terrific. There's lots of gunplay and room to room clearing of bad guys, cumulatively probably hours of the two main characters, sometimes accompanied, making their way through buildings or back alleys, covering each other with high tech weapons then shouting ""move."" Everything happens fast including the sex which is obligatory on nearly every show. I always seem to watch two or three of these at a gulp. it's like an old Saturday morning serial with a cliffhanger to end each episode.",1463443200,,745,4.968

Story is ok, a little contrived here and there, but it's an action show and they do that part really well. Do a good job showing infantry movements and tactics, (except they hold onto the magwell all the time).  The two leads have good chemistry and show character development as the show progresses (although I have only seen the two seasons available on Prime). The sex scenes seem hamfisted and exist solely for nuditys sake, of which I'm not bothered by, it just seems unnecessary at times. Definitely a show for mature audiences only.",1462147200,,667,4.75

The other aspect of the show is that the writers seem to take some care to be realistic in the way the people handle their jobs rather than formulaic.  Could do more of that but I appreciate the level of detail.  I'm really tired of Hollywood protagonists not killing the bad guys when they have the chance and then closing the eyelids of those who die.  THEY DON'T STAY CLOSED YA MORONS!  Please stop that.  It really ruins the connection to the story and is like being slapped in the face.",1461715200,,685,4.722689075630252

5364031,2,B009SCONXQ,Spoiler alert The action scenes are nice lots of violence and gore but the writing is utterly ridiculous. Just about every episode the character Scott sleep with whatever hot women or not so hot is set to watch him. So basically you see guy butt and a nipple or two every episode but it is made by skinamax so what can you expect. I watch a scene where the main characters are in a shoot out run out of ammo then some how kill 4 guys armed with assault rifles. But did not grab the guns just to have two other people come in take the item's they were protecting. Then in the next episode they get in a shoot out while sitting in a old Honda or Toyota with about 10 guys shooting assault rifles but no one shoots there tires out. I have just about given up on watching this anymore 1 1/2 seasons in.,1458777600,,798,4.089171974522293

S4 comes out March 1st - will be buying that as well.

They manage to combine old school sexiness with modern sensibilities (women aren't the only objects, and aren't all subservient...not by a long stretch).  If Black Ops could come to life and be a little more geo-politically cerebral, you'd have this. AND you get an American guy pretending to be British, and an Aussie pretending to be American, sooooo....think Robert Downey Junior in Tropic Thunder.

5364316,5,B009SCONXQ,"There's sort of a comical amount of sex and nudity--a la ""Skin-emax""--and I often refer to this as ""that show about the handsome spy guys,"" but it's compelling, entertaining, and a good binge watch. I especially appreciate how authentic the military tactics seem. The way they hold their weapons, the way they move, strategize, proceed, curse, get injured, it seems more authentic than most TV depictions. The actors must have worked very hard to develop those skills. The writing is okay, but it's not the greatest draw of the show. There's a sort of A-team predictability about the arc of each season, and the writers tend to telegraph their passes, but that's okay. Production quality is high and the show, on the whole, is entertaining (especially if you like boobs, butts, explosions, car chases, and guns). I wish every season were available for free on Prime. I'll be waiting.",1455667200,,883,4.932885906040268

5364421,4,B009SCONXQ,"This series is very entertaining, especially if one can look beyond its more testosterone-laden aspects (frequent battleground hook-ups stretch one's suspension of disbelief to the absolute limit as far as I'm concerned).  The characters are interesting for the most part, and have been gradually developed over the first two seasons, although the depiction of Damien Scott as the brash, crude, tough-talking American borders on caricature.  The show's willingness to suddenly lose key characters at any time makes things less predictable than usual, so you never know who will survive and who will not (other than the two leads).  On the other hand, there is a laughable lack of accountability for the seemingly hundreds of native casualties that pile up whenever an assault occurs on foreign soil (how many bullets can these guns actually fire, and why are there so many bad guys with machine guns who never seem to be able to hit any of the Section 20 team?).  Regardless, the intensity of the show is high, the action is plentiful, and the production values are high.  The show knows exactly what it's here for -- entertainment -- and delivers it very well.",1454976000,,1161,4.994818652849741

5364470,2,B009SCONXQ,"Kind of preposterous. We didn't like Season 2 nearly as much as Season 1.  It just got a bit too ridiculous. Don't get me wrong - we still liked the characters, and knew better than to take the whole thing too seriously, but there is a limit. Just a short while into the second season, it was clear the writers were only interested in having it focus on nothing more than sex and violent action scenes. Now if that's what you LIKE, then go for it, but for us.. since from here on out, the  additional seasons would require payment, we're going to pass.",1454544000,,552,4.298076923076923

5364478,3,B009SCONXQ,Season two much like the first season. Lots of sex and violence that is beginning to get old. If you like that kind of thing than its great but I really wonder how they will keep viewers interested unless new plots are developed and the actors become a little more human. Some really nice location shots in third world places keep interest. The verbal exchanges between the two  rival male agents can be quite funny at times.,1454544000,2,425,4.51948051948052

Acting and directing are definitely b-grade, and the convention of pot-boilers, heroes in shootouts against much larger, more heavily armed opponents, sometimes gets downright silly -- the bad guys must be really bad shots.  The background shots of various locations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, however, are at times beautiful, and the images of squalor in cities and countryside are disturbing.",1454284800,,573,5.415730337078652

5364729,5,B009SCONXQ,"Strike Back is about a British Counter Terrorism group. Lots of urban assault and hand-to-hand combat scenes. Very nicely done show all the way around (story, acting, dialogue, special effects). Of course it wouldnt be Cinemax without the gratuitous nudity. So you might not want to watch your first episode with your lady.

It is filmed in England and released on Cinemax in the US. I had never heard of it, but it has been running from 2010-2015. I just binge watched the first 2 seasons on Amazon Prime. I would imagine it is also available on Netflix. I cant believe that I have never seen an ad or heard about it.

Evidently, it is somewhat like the show the Unit which I never got around to watching but have heard excellent things about. Definitely worth watching the first episode to see if you like it.",1453334400,,811,4.5479452054794525

A lot must of gone into the production of the big action scenes, as it looked much more realistic then a lot of crap out there..Stonebridge and Scott definitely missed being shot by a couple thousand rounds though, but they made it look good..The writer(s) surely had access to ex Delta,Seal, SAS, and similar top tier operators, as that what made these ""6 million dollar soldiers"" kick so much ass..I have no doubt that the U.S./UK spend a lot of $$$ to train the best of the best and it pays off..It took me a couple episodes to get into the show, but once I got into it, I was hooked and craving more..I binged watched Season 1 & 2 within a couple weeks and can't wait for Season 3 & 4 to be 'Prime available'...It's nice to watch an entertaining series without all the 'politically correct' nonsense that is in the majority of TV these days, especially in the U.S. The Brits let it all out...Amazon, bring on Season 3 & 4 ASAP!!!",1451692800,,1269,4.695067264573991

And I used to think the sex scenes were gratuitous - they still are but - they are central to telling us more about Daemon.  Just enjoy the beauty of the moment.  If you get queasy, step out for a refill.",1451692800,,512,4.644444444444445

The action is a little over the top, and bad guys are always such bad shots, but it's many a young gung-ho soldier's dream to see action like this. I like that the villains are ""bad"" guys. While the heroes are not always that ""good"", they always represent the ""right"" side. As an older man I don't appreciate all the sex scenes and nudity, it doesn't add anything to the stories.

Rhona Mitra could have ruined season 2, if it hadn't been for our 2 protagonists and all the action. Winchester does a pretty good job of simulating the persona of an operator (to an untrained eye.)

This is an extremely intense series and oh so incredibly well done.  I suspect that it is more true to life that most people would like to know.  I loved it.

Also if you're like me you'll probably want a bit more background and will find an interest in catching the Sky1 (before Cinemax) series 6 episodes of Chris Ryan's Strike Back (available on dvd and Blu-ray on Amazon).

Philip Winchester is perfect in the role of the loyal lifelong British soldier. There aren't enough good things to say about the beautiful MIchelle Lukes.
It never stops getting better. I've seen it all the way through to the end and I am sure I will do it again, soon.

Also, too much of 30 people shooting at them and missing every time.

It takes two episodes to complete a storyline, so every odd-numbered episode ends in a cliffhanger, so you'll probably end up watching both, back to back. As a funny aside, for as many gunfights there are per episode, the good guys are always out of ammo. You would think they'd learn have a backpack full of the stuff at the ready.

5365519,3,B009SCONXQ,For the script and acting I would assign 4 stars for both seasons 1 and 2. It's tight writing and jam packed action draws you in and makes you tense all over. I found I cared for pretty much all the characters and their back stories. What makes me down grade this program is the violence and sex. The sex portrayals are practically gratuitous and unnecessarily graphic. I'm constantly amazed at the seemingly immediate arousal and satisfaction of the female characters. The mechanics are pretty much the same too. While the action is totally engrossing the level of violence and its portrayal is also unnecessarily graphic. It needn't be so. Just look back at some early horror or action stories from Alfred Hitchcock. He leads you there and leaves you hanging and having to bridge that wondrous gap between imagination and reality. I really keep trying to pull myself out of the series and most probably will succeed fairly soon because my eyes pop or I have to look away at some really horrisome details best left unsaid. Enough is enough! (And yes I'm aware or the pre-show disclaimer),1443484800,,1088,4.761904761904762

5365529,4,B009SCONXQ,Good show.  The American soldier they could have given a more dynamic personality to.  He had sex with the hot girl in every episode.  So one dimensional and predictable.  But overall the show was pretty good for what it was going for.,1443312000,,235,4.523809523809524

5365538,5,B009SCONXQ,"They stick to the concept of having a 2-episode-long sub-story running on the background of a longer story that runs the entire season. Keeps viewers wondering what is going to happen next making the series interesting, while allowing a natural break after 2-episodes if you want to stop and resume later. Damien Scott is entertaining as ever, with rock-solid Michael Stonebridge alongside. Does get somewhat predictable at times but not so much to make stop watching it altogether. I liked the previous season better, personally.
A word of caution though - with nudity and characters shown having sex, and with the violence levels, Strike Back is suitable only for adults. Overall, Great entertainment! I love it!",1443225600,,714,5.163793103448276

5365642,5,B009SCONXQ,"A fast-paced, shoot-em-up from the Brits who make no secret out of their disgust at Americans. The characters are well structured and as a woman viewer I enjoyed every minute of each episode. Can't wait to see what they come up with in the third series. Didn't even mind the nudity in the sex scenes. The female characters are very well created too.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-The-Moon/dp/B00N9KH8E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond The Moon</a>",1442707200,,501,6.382352941176471

Unexpected plot twists. The only drawback is Amazon only has a couple of the 5 seasons up. Hoping the put all of them on so we can finish the series out.

Also, interesting to note that the two main guys in the show will be in regular TV series starting soon - Blindspot and The Player. Looking forward to both of those after liking the actors in this!",1442534400,,529,4.29

The problem I have with this season, was the same that I had with season one. The first was that one of the main characters had sex with someone ever esp to a different woman, which the majority of the time did not have anything to do with the plot and second
was the number of bad guys the two main characters was able to kill was excessive and unbelievable after a while",1442534400,,547,4.29126213592233

5365657,4,B009SCONXQ,"Strike Back's characters are the kind of people you would either want on your side or want to be like. This show portrays a world of pure action-adventure fantasy. How it is created and produced makes its events and accompanying actions seem plausible in the real world. Its characters, on the other hand, approach being super-heroes. Yet that is a good thing. By identifying with either one of them a viewer's sense of wish-fulfillment reaches gratification. Who would not like to possess mental and physical comportment both male, main characters portray? Become immersed in the fantasy and a sense of gratification is achieved.

For anyone who loves frequent occurring big explosions; this is a series for you. For anyone who enjoys frequent and cool, well choreographed fire-fights; this series is for you. Just sit back in your chair, so to speak, watch Strike Back, which has its basis in old western films. the wild west this time, South Africa, and let your mind go on an action-adventure.",1442448000,,997,4.970059880239521

In other words, they could close a door, and I would be able to imagine what was happening in bed without it being thrust in my face.

Amazon has done a terrific job of upgrading their service, the picture quality of this series is superb watching it on a new Vizio 42"" HD thru Roku.

5366176,5,B009SCONXQ,"I loved this show except for the porn.  If you like a lot of action with shooting, this show is for you.

5366189,4,B009SCONXQ,"A good, often very good series, but with a problem. The first season is actually the second season, following a 6 episode opener. So season 2 is actually season 3. I wish the entire series would be made available.",1439596800,,213,4.487179487179487
5366190,3,B009SCONXQ,"Sex and violence seem to be the main theme for this series.  Main characters are the cliche broken hero types with great skill and poor judgement. There is a at least one sex seen in every episode which seems to be based only on the writer's need to fill a gap in the scene.  Lots of some unbelievable and other more believable but fun explosive fight scenes using guns, grenades, bombs, etc.  While women are shown as good fighters and commanders, they are always inherently sexy... no stereotype there.

I have stopped watching after several episodes due to boredom and general lack of creative writing.",1439596800,,605,4.733333333333333

5366315,4,B009SCONXQ,"I put this show in drawer marked guilty pleasure. It's preposterous, but in a Bond-ian manner, the Daniel Craig Bond especially. Most of Season 2 was shot in South Africa. As a fan of South Africa who has officially promoted the country as a location, I like that. The action is unrelenting. The sex is graphic. As for the violence, well, this is not a show for Quakers.",1438992000,,370,4.455882352941177
5366316,3,B009SCONXQ,"This is entertaining.  The production is quite good, and there are many settings convincingly presented in different areas of the world.  The plot lines are interesting and current, without much regard to political correctness -- i.e. the fictional terrorists are strikingly similar to terrorists in the real world. The interplay between the two main characters -- mismatched, of course -- is fun, and continues to evolve from one episode to another.  The gunplay is frequent, and at times, most times really, is absurd.  The bad guys apparently do not aim, and also patiently wait their turn to be gunned down.  This happens at least twice an episode, sometimes more.  But this show's aim is entertainment, not enlightenment, so for those willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief, it is worth a look.",1438992000,,806,5.022556390977444

5366547,5,B009SCONXQ,"The first season of ""Strike Back"" was a ten episode thrill ride.  I had little hope season two could match it or even come close.  I was wrong.  Season two is just as good as, if not better than, season one.  The pace is fast, the characters believable, and the violence almost numbing.  At times I thought I was watching a first person shooter video game, except I wasn't doing the shooting.  Despite all the endless violence, the writers somehow continue to develop the relationship between the two male leads as they become more trusting and dependent on each other to survive and accomplish the mission's end.  You don't expect these character developments amidst all the human carnage, but somehow it is accomplished.  As in season one, no one--no matter how central or tangential to the story line--has safe passage.  I have seen trailers for the fall 2015 TV season that indicate that both male leads have their own new series for American television.  I hope this doesn't mean there won't be a season three.",1437523200,,1015,4.748571428571428

5366584,4,B009SCONXQ,Like a more shoot em up '24' with much more realistic action scenes. Willing to sacrifice actors so it doesn't evolve into a James Bond only the bad guys lose genre. Always a 1.5 to 2 minute sex scene totally gratuitous to the plot - I guess it is a British/European TV requirement but somewhat jarring to this American. I get a kick that the British Sgt. is really an American and the American Sgt. is an Aussie. Could not tell it from the accents until I read that online.,1437436800,,474,4.277777777777778
5366585,5,B009SCONXQ,"Great storyline and believable main stars (and in this series, the chief villain is great).  Sometimes it is a little hard to accept the ease in which the get into, survive and leave such dangerous areas.

What sets it apart from other action formulaics is the ""A"" list actors cast in the roles.

5366851,5,B009SCONXQ,"Enjoy watching this TV series. Action, drama, suspense and they are moments of humor. Secret Organization 'Section 20' British Military Intelligence. The chemistry between Stg. Damien Scott and Stg. Michael Stonebridge is priceless. They go out on high risk mission throughout the globe. The writing I believe is great. The place they shoot the series are also great. It's almost watching a movie on every episode. Would highly recommend this tv series to anyone who enjoys thrillers, action and drama. The supporting cast compliments the rest of the main characters.",1435968000,,567,5.311111111111111

5366853,4,B009SCONXQ,"I really enjoy this show. I like the fact that it is all filmed on location. I enjoyed Season two every bit as much as season one! I like the way the cast works together and that at any time, any character, no matter how important to show, can be eliminated during the course of their duties.  I especially enjoy the way Stonebridge and Scott work together.  They both come across as if they've been actual operatives for many years.  I am sad to hear that the Season starting end of July 2015 will be the final season for Strike Back.",1435968000,,535,4.2772277227722775

5366890,5,B009SCONXQ,"Excellent series.  Whoever is doing the technical consulting actually got the tactics better than any show I've seen.  Seems the writers started to get a little mainstream in the last few episodes, a little ""Hollywood"" with the dodging bullets and hiding behind tissue paper from bullets nonsense; but still solid.  Hopefully, the elements that are attempting to bring ""focus group"" plot development to this will sit down, shut up, and let the writers do their thing.

Well, worth watching.",1435881600,,490,5.1645569620253164

5366893,3,B009SCONXQ,"This season is much worse then the previous one. I wonder if the writers are different or if they just didn't care. Story line is very thin, dialogs are awful, and I just couldn't stand really bad jokes and lame references (the delivery of those jokes wasn't good either, but that could possibly be attributed to the quality of the materials the actors had to work with). I would have been really unhappy if I had paid for this, as it is I just wasted my time.",1435708800,,460,4.2988505747126435
5366894,4,B009SCONXQ,"I was a big fan of Season 1 (actually Season 2 for the series but #1 on Amazon), it was good, silly fun. It seems to me that in Season 2 (3), the production team is trying to be more serious. However, either the writers, actors, or director don't have the chops for this. There are some good turns by Rhona Mitra as the new leader of Section 20 and Shane Taylor as a former soldier gone nutter. But I don't particularly like the more serious version of Scott and while I like Philip Winchester as an action actor, he simply can't play an effective grieving husband. I hope by Season 3 (4) the boys return to their usual selves!",1435622400,,627,4.233333333333333

5366977,4,B009SCONXQ,I've reviewed season 1 earlier and my opinion is the same. It's a good male fantasy show with better plots and writing than I'd expected.,1435276800,,137,4.52
5366978,4,B009SCONXQ,All considered a pretty good action show. The actors are believable in their roles and the settings are current and accurate. The one downside for me is that there may be a little too much violence if that makes any sense. Seems like they may be filling space with prolonged shootouts when it could be shorter with more storyline....just saying.,1435276800,,345,4.766666666666667

The entertaining BBC/CinemaX series starts ""good"" and gets better with each episode: but Season 2 never really reaches greatness although the actors' accents have improved.

According to IMDB (Internet Movie Data Base), the ""British"" leading role (Sgt. Stonebridge) is played by an American and the American ""Section 20"" operator (Sgt. Scott) is played by an Australian: yet, they seem perfectly cast for their respective roles.

The American Section 20 operator apparently oozes some irresistible Marvel hero-like pheromones (is there a Pheromone Man?) as he beds nearly every woman in the show despite displaying the charm of a questionably sterile, but definitely cold, gynecological instrument.

If this carried a movie rating, it would most definitely be ""NC-17"" for the explicit sex scenes.

I'd rate this season 4.5 Stars or somewhere between ""I Like It"" and ""I Love It"" as the writing (at times) works a little too hard to be ""cool"": and, some of the military tactics/character choices seem questionable and inconsistent (e.g. expressly declaring not to shoot at a helicopter because it has a nuclear warhead on board in one episode but then shooting at a truck with the same type of nuclear warhead tied to the flatbed in a different episode).

For Fans of ""The Unit"", ""MI-5"", international special forces type film/TV, and soft-core, this series may be described as Seal Team Six meets ""MI-5"" with an injection of testosterone and plot thickening, ""story-line essential"", soft-core scenes in nearly every episode.

Military tactics application and execution rank near ""The Unit"" and seem about as realistic as TV drama permits given the notion that TV stars can neither be encumbered nor can they have their faces or pecs obstructed by standard military tactical gear - especially helmets (except for the pilot episode).

If you can overlook some of the minor inconsistencies, graphic sex and violence, the penchant for dropping F-bombs during chase and combat scenes, then you may find this series entertaining -- when in the mood for mindless action.

5367158,3,B009SCONXQ,"I tried to get into this show - watched three seasons to really give it a shot.  The problem with this type of show is multifold (SPOILERS BELOW):

Despite all of the flying bullets, there's never any real tension because you know the leads will NEVER be seriously injured or killed.  The Richard Artmitage season was more about John Porter's wits and instinct than ""soldiering,"" so it didn't need the redundant gun battles.

Yet, the entire season is basically ""watch Section 20 be incredibly inept and reckless and beg the question of why this is supposed to be such an elite unit.""  Both lead characters should be dead many times over, especially Damien Scott. And yes, this applies to the Project Dawn season as well.

I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to like Scott, but all I kept thinking was, ""This dude would have been dishonorably discharged regardless of any conspiracy.""  He's supposed to be the ladies' man, the ""charismatic"" one, yet Stonebridge (when given the chance) is much more effective when talking to others.

The genuinely interesting geopolitics are skimmed over in favor of incessant and pointless gunfights.  I was more interested in the Zimbabwean characters, particularly the father and daughter revolutionaries, than any of the personal conflicts of the leads. And the actor (Rhashan Stone) who played Sinclaire brought a sense of integrity and class to the show, so imagine my disappointment with his death.

In summary, the theme song and seeing Winchester shirtless are the best parts of the show.",1433980800,,1524,5.011904761904762

5367192,4,B009SCONXQ,"Worked through the first two seasons of this in record time. Thoroughly enjoyable. Two-man expendables team travels the world kicking assets for British military intelligence. There's an over arching story thread for each season but my friends have been able to join me, jumping in at odd points, and enjoying the action, the tough as nails heroes, the camaraderie and the big hairy fiery explosions. Episodes generally unfold in twos, i.e. one culminating in a cliffhanger that becomes the explosive opening of the next installment. The story within the over arching seasonal narrative wraps at the end of the second episode and we're on to the next locale. Production values are high, way beyond the cheesy shortcuts of direct-to-DVD action fare. Excellent use of mostly Hungarian and South African locations to mimic  global hotspots like Mogadishu, Nairobi, Kosovo, Mumbai, etc. Constant references to persons and places making the world a scary place right now add authenticity and challenge your geographical knowledge. The men are all real men and the women are all hot. This is action fantasy. Warning: Not family fare. Some brief scenes border on soft care.",1433721600,,1166,5.202127659574468

5367303,5,B009SCONXQ,"Great program with awesome ""tactics"" in the action scene's - not the typical cheesy Hollywood bullsheet, it is apparent that this program enlisted real operators and the actors mimic currently and sound clearing tactics worth studying. Story arc and ""technology"" used still leave a bit to be desired, but the action sequences and flawed character (which the series is not afraid to kill main characters at volume - definitely a plus that crushes predictability) with girls, guns, gore, gunfights sell this series.
Look I know 3 guys wouldn't take on a cabal of 30 terrorists, but when your watching these guys crush 20 rebels without breaking a sweat your pretty much on the edge of your seat pumped up every time they come around a corner a zip every poor mook looking over an ak with lots of ""ell yeah"" moments, again never knowing when a main character is going to get decimated - a fun series well done for what it is.",1421971200,,922,4.662576687116564

5367310,3,B009SCONXQ,"I liked the first season quite a bit but this one seems to be a bit thinner than its predecessor.

Here's the scoop. The boys are back but with a new commanding officer (Rhona Mitra) and in a new location (South Africa). Four nuclear triggers have gone missing and a wealthy industrialist (Charles Nance) figures to use them as a threat to give Africa back to its natives. Meanwhile, a renegade operative is out to kill Sgt. Stonebridge after he was forced to kill the operative's brother when said brother pops a cork during a training exercise and begins killing his fellow trainees.

As I mentioned above the script seemed much thinner and lazier to me than in the first season. The writers fleshed things out with a lot of fire fights and hand to hand. The storyline is decent enough but it seemed a long way around to get where you're going. Plus, I like when these types of films use current technology to help them do their thing. The Bourne films were good at this. Here, somehow, it seemed too lazy and pat. They always had closed circuit TV to get info when they needed it and facial recognition was always really quick and spot on. The 2 key guys recover way too quickly from injuries and beatings and their headquarters, which were blown up, seem to have been restored too quickly. In light of the fact that their department's future was in serious doubt makes that all the more curious.

No. This just wasn't as good as the first season. Not a bad watch. Just don't go out of your way to watch it.",1417996800,,1510,4.444043321299639

5367339,5,B009SCONXQ,"While this series has some glaring flaws and inconsistencies, that doesn't stop me from loving it. Let's start with the problems. Virtually every episode has one or more shoot-'em-up scenes with a massive body count, often of a dozen or more, and the sequences are pretty much set up like the violent shooting video games that young people have been playing for the past 20 or more years (I assume it's thus being marketed to that audience). Also, there isn't much analysis of why the bad guys are THAT bad, and sometimes, the rationale can be pretty superficial - I thought this to be particularly true at the end of (North American) season two, though I'll offer no spoilers on that one. Finally, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, where ""anyone"" can die, we can feel pretty confident that the two protagonists are going to make it to the end of the season, so long as there are no problems with their contracts, or they don't drop this show to take on something even bigger (and this one is pretty big, mind you).

Now, on the positive side... It goes without saying that Philip Winchester as Stonebridge and Sullivan Stapleton as Damien Scott are absolutely inspired. This is a buddy show, and these two guys are perfect buddies in that time-honoured tradition - with Winchester the ""straight"" guy and Stapleton the ""loose (but dependable) cannon."" They are also allowed at times (never for long) to have fun, and that element of intermittent delight was never written into the (earlier) UK season one (see my review of Chris Ryan's Strike Back). As to the production budget, it's obviously of good size, and thus we are able to travel the world (literally) with our protagonists. The screenwriting is excellent, the dialogue regularly engaging and deeply insightful, and the soundtrack/music are state of the art - outstanding. The same goes for the cinematography/camerawork, and the Blu-Ray picture is crisp and clear (you will not get that in UK season one, which is equivalent in terms of the competency of its actors, but produced on a much lower budget). Finally, it should be obvious from what I have written that these are characters you will care about (Mr. Stapleton sustained a head injury in Thailand earlier this year, and I'm concerned for him in the same way I would be for a friend).... but, more than that, these are characters who will teach you about yourself and the world: that is, they often face moral dilemmas, and are able to handle them in such a way that it is necessary to reflect on one's own life and choices, and how we might measure up in the same circumstances. The moral dilemmas feel VERY real - they are not staged or strained, and the actors are at that highest level, in that they have the ability to take us to the unexplored places of our own lives.

In conclusion... this series (originating in the UK) was a surprise. I hadn't heard anything about it until seeing the first season blu-ray on display one day while shopping. So I'll rate this one my ""lucky find of the year."" (Last year, my lucky find was Orphan Black, so I think my standards are reasonably high.) If you can handle the extremely high body count, you will be rewarded with every episode. There is very little time wasted at any point in this series. And... season two stands up perfectly well to season one. Two great years and counting.",1405123200,,3346,4.669491525423729

You never really know what could happen the next minute.  The three main characters played by Philip Winchester (Michael Stonebridge), Sullivan Stapleton (Damien Scott) and Rhona Mitra (Rachel Dalton) kick ass plain and simple.  They do what needs to be done despite the improbability of survival.  Charles Dance plays an great ""Bad Guy"".

5367386,5,B009SCONXQ,"It is a great show to watch.  Anything that contains guns, tactics, Cinemax nudity and semi-current events to tie a story together makes for a great show.  After watching season one, episodes two and three - I ordered the first and second season.  Ordering the blue-ray with the digital copy allowed me to link it to Vudu and watch it on my Roku 3.

The show is great, a lot of fun to watch.  Definitely a show you can marathon like we all used to for 24.  Only downfall is that each season is only 10 episodes.

As I write this, it is cheaper to buy both blue-ray seasons with the digital copy for $39.92 instead of $28.99 each season with Amazon Instant video.

I was willing to wait the two days to save $18.06.  If you are wanting to have Vudu/Flickster/iTunes access.",1386547200,,772,4.3426573426573425

The hand-to-hand-fighting scenes of season 2, episode 1 looked fake and stiff compared with the ones in season 3. However, the shooting scenes where the terrorists took over a hotel in India were exciting, suspenseful and engaging. It was very much like the Mumbai attack.

Episode 3 was so illogical that it was hilarious. For example, the terrorist did not tie up the hands of the 2 special agents after they were captured. Consequently, they were able to turn the table on the terrorists! What a childish event it was!

The acting was not convincing either.

One overall objective to be resolved in ten episodes, but every two episodes are a movie that contributes to the overall but has its own smaller plot resolution.

5367417,5,B009SCONXQ,"People are always asking me if the tactics are authentic. In a word , YES. I may be in the minority, but one of my favorite things about this show is that we have a Brit and a Yank standing shoulder to shoulder. If You have ever been to war, You will understand the relationship as truly special. One of the most idiotic and immature debates on You-tube and paintball enthusiasts is ""who is better? The SAS/SBS or CAG? If you are immature and have low self esteem you debate this stupid topic all day long. It might seem superficial, but I like that members/representatives of  these two units working ""together"", because news flash that's how it really is. Now for the soft porn? I will let You be the judge on that. I don't feel like its wrong to say that some of the best soldiers on this planet are British SF, and became my friends.
Listen, This is just really exciting television that uses extremely authentic military tactics as sort of a character in it's own right. I can't say enough about how the two main actors and even the supporting cast like Michelle Lukes and Rona Mitra portray soldiers. They way they walk, talk, carry themselves and most importantly how they shoot move and communicate.(every once in a while the lingo or nomenclature will be a little off, but they get it more right than wrong) They must of really trained hard and people like me appreciate at notice those things.

5367421,5,B009SCONXQ,"first off let me say I do not watch action shooting type movies. they are usully just not my thing. But I do love shooter video games. This series reminds me of a really good video game. like call of duty or something. I got the first two episodes of season 1 when I bought banshee (which I also love) and it was stuck to the back, the disk sat around for a while at my house until I decided to give it a try. The first episode got me hooked right away. I did not expect to like it because of it being an action shooter terrorist military type themed show. But The way its done is amazing. again it reminds me of a really good shooter video game. there is humor here and there and its well written. I bought season 1 and two on dvd after watching the first two episodes. I have missed most of season 3 so far that's still airing on tv sadly, but I am very extremely happy to hear that there is going to be a prequel, strike back origins premiering October 25th or something 2013. that should be interesting. I hope to be able to catch up on season 3, and I hope even more it will be available to buy very soon along with the prequel. I hope it gets a season 4!",1379894400,,1160,3.982832618025751

5367425,4,B009SCONXQ,"Season 1 of Strike Back got 10 stars out of 5 from me, Amazon just restricted me to 5. Season 2 still had a lot of the great that season 1 did; the chemistry between characters, the action, the humor. But somehow it just felt more produced, more fictional.....fake I guess.

First of all the plot was kind of out there and felt like it was just something they settled for to get away from the Islamic extremist adversary we are used to seeing with these shows.

I also did not like how they threw women into the tactical teams. Call me sexist but the SAS does not use women and this felt forced and politically correct, much unlike season 1. Scott and Stonebridge felt like real elite special forces operators all season one, in this one it just did not have that feel to it because they had scrubs along with them more often than not. The others just do not appear to be the operators the two mains are, did not feel right.

Hey, I have to give it a 4 because season 1 got a 5 and this one just was not the same caliber. Close...but not quite. Still a very enjoyable show and I cannot wait for season 3 to come out on Amazon.",1379462400,,1126,4.155963302752293

This Season as in great Strike Back tradition has a more real touch to it and mantains the central theme of redemption and triumph when everything else determines that it's time to give up and play dead.
This season has a better choice of weapons and realistic eqipment and field tactics that are more real than the standard fare you are used to.  Except when you have non-repeating combat female characters charging into battle in high heels.

5367430,3,B009SCONXQ,"Sorry for the confusing headline but if you don't know, this second season of 'Strike Back' (SB going forward) from Cinemax is actually season three overall of the series which was originally called ""Chris Ryan's Strike Back"" based on the novels of the same that aired on Sky1 in the U.K.  I still haven't seen the first series (season) that starred Richard Armitage (""MI-5""/""Spooks,"" others...) however, his character was unceremoniously murdered by terrorists in the opening scene of Cinemax's first season of the show so even though it's not technically necessary to have the UK series, it does all tie in together.

I thoroughly enjoyed Cinemax's first season of SB for all of its action, generally strong writing for an action series and great plot-twists that rivaled the best of '24.'  Truthfully speaking, SB is big, dumb, guilty-pleasure fun with plenty of sex, violence and foul language to appeal to the purile teenager in all of us while at the same time providing compelling story arcs.

That being said, I was rather disappointed in CInemax's SB season two.  Don't get me wrong, it was still fun but it really didn't go anywhere and the motivations for the main villain were stupid as to seem like they ran out of ideas and just went for Bond Villain motivations.

****MINOR SPOILER ALERT*** (This is revealed in the first episode)

Another thing that really bugged me was that it was obvious that they didn't know what to do with the character of Stonebridge's wife so they just... y'know... got rid of her... in the most bizarre of circumstances that wind up being a major plot point throughout the whole season.  It was a very convoluted and unnecessary sub-plot that was pretty cheap and obvious to anyone who was paying attention and it didn't even have a decent resolution.  NOTE TO THE WRITERS: if you're going to off a character because they don't fit in to where the show and the rest of the characters are heading, don't drag it out.  Just off them and be done with it.  This show only has ten episodes per season, already.

Overall, there was a lot more that they could have done with Cinemax's SB season two but they wasted time on pointless sub-plots.  The mysteries surrounding Damien Scott's past are a goldmine that can go any direction and Stonebridge's character is being woefully neglected as far as development is concerned.

Still, Cinemax's SB season two was fun despite my complaint and I wouldn't kick it out of the DVR for eating crackers (and I gladly pre-ordered this set).

Of course the video and the audio quality of the set is fantastic on Blu-ray, especially the DTS HD-MA audio track. It's feature-film quality across the board.  The only complaint I have is that unlike Cinemax's SB season one, this is Blu-ray and Digital Copy ONLY and there are no DVDs.  Not suggesting that  I really care because I don't use them for anything other than coasters but I paid the same price for season two as I did for season one and got less less product.  Just sayin'... no big deal really.",1378512000,2,3025,4.727619047619048

5367436,4,B009SCONXQ,"First off: love the show, but I can't rate every show I love with five stars.  I'm writing this review based on two seasons, actually: seasons 1 and 2 (not counting season 0, and yes, I'm going for an inside joke here).

I call it a graphic novel because that is the level of realism.  Other reviewers have spoken positively of the pace and style of the storylines, and I agree with them.  The series is engrossing.  The female characters are at the same time male- and feminist-fantasy icons.  I have known more than my share of special-ops types and none of them are female--and if they were, they wouldn't be seen traipsing around in hip-huggers and low-cut shirts.  NOTE TO PRODUCERS: I'm not asking for a change!  But seriously...  It was sort of like when *The Unit* jumped the shark with the pretty blonde ""operative.""  And as for the male-fantasy part, Scott (the character, that is) speaks for himself.

In a few years, things may change with the real-life equivalents of the female characters (the changes have already started to start, but there is no prayer of there being a female special-ops major to be found at this writing, let alone a special-ops female colonel).  But for now, there's clearly a feminist fantasy at work here.

So, if like me, you like graphic novels on TV, you'll love this.  If you want a realistic special-ops story ... not quite so much.",1378080000,2,1376,4.632231404958677

5367457,5,B009SCONXQ,"This is much in the same as the first season. The differences, Scott and Stonebridge are comfortable as partners once Stonebridge insists on rescuing Scott and they get back together.

Stonebridge starts out as an instructor of the SAS, cozily (unhappily?) holed up with his wife, who is bitter that she's miscarried, and seems to blame that on her husband in some way. He deals with this the same way he does everything, he avoids dealing with it. When she is killed by a revenge seeking soldier, he finally shows emotion. Then he shuts down, saying all the right things to make it back to section 20.

Well, we all know that the kind of soldier he is belongs out in the field. He will only truly be happy if he is on a mission, taking orders. It is more the adrenaline of the fight that makes his blood sing than any other kind of passion.

Scott and Stonebridge reunite and take their sprawling, brawling mission across Africa, spraying bullets like rain. This time they are less alone than last season. Richmond has been allowed into the field, and Baxter, a young fresh faced kid, and the new boss-lady, Dalton, every bit as unlikable as Col. Grant was. Sinclair makes a few forays out of the command center, ultimately resulting in his death. There is naturally a CIA operative who is manipulating things, twisting the knife in Scott to get her way over and over.

There is the ultimate bad guy, Conrad Knox, wealthy, zipping down a path of destruction that is both public and private, a nasty mercenary who seems fed up, and the crazy, revenge seeking tormenter who killed Mrs Stonebridge to harass the team all the way across multiple countries.

They escape from one impossible situation after another. There are some crazy battles. Watching the two main men fight is pretty intense. There is a purity to their purpose. Some of the others, there is a deliberate viciousness, whereas the feel from Scott and Stonebridge is almost noble, if killing so many could even be called noble.

The women are again without mercy, and most of Scott's hookups you would hesitate to turn your back on even to pull up your shorts.

If you are looking for adventure, firefights, a series where only soldiers understand what is in the mind of soldiers, but others try to intrude and force their will time after time... then this is your adventure series. Set in the midst of incredible scenery, with all involved struggling for survival, this is definitely it. Enjoy.",1376006400,6,2459,4.6914153132250584

5367465,4,B009SCONXQ,"STRIKE BACK is so prolific with its nude scenes, even the showmakers of GAME OF THRONES are awestruck. Just goes to show that, 'neath all that placid tea-drinking and scone-munching, the Brits flaunt quite the salacious streak. But gratuitous nekkidness aside, STRIKE BACK also rewards the viewer with gritty character development, a runaway train of a narrative, and, of course, the explosive, explosive gunplay. And with its secretive counter-terrorist task force deployed on a globetrotting pace, you may even soak up culture and end up a worldlier person.

STRIKE BACK is the only reason I keep Cinemax. Season 2 (or Series 3, if you're in the UK) offers ten more episodes and, at the start, shuffles the make-up of Section 20. Sgt. Stonebridge (Philip Winchester, a Yank actor posing as a Brit) is off the team, having opted for assignment on British soil to be near his wife. Nowadays, Stonebridge is a training officer at the local S.A.S. Training Camp. Or as one of his mates mockingly addresses him: ""Mr. Stonebridge, desk jockey.""

This leaves Sgt. Damian Scott (Sullivan Stapleton, an Aussie posing as a Yank) as Section 20's primary field agent. And when Damian is taken prisoner during a soured ops, who else but Stonebridge gets tapped for a bit of a rescue? I guess I can encapsulate stuff and just say that, this time out, Section 20 targets a hijacked set of nuclear triggers. But that's doing a disservice to the show. These ten new episodes make up another thrilling season. There are twists and turns and setback after setback, and, early on, a stroke of tragedy that turns the tables on the Scott/Stonebridge dynamics. Season 2 finds the formerly by-the-book Stonebridge suddenly the loose cannon of the bunch, and the disaffected American, Scott, now the steadying presence. However, in keeping with his bad boy image, light is shed on Scott's murky past, particularly his shady affiliation with the CIA. As always, STRIKE BACK excels in showcasing the emotional toll the brutal missions exact on these super-soldiers. Winchester and Stapleton are so good. They sink into the skins of their characters. Even their silences convey depths of meaning. On the fun side, their tough guy banter is endlessly entertaining.

If you've been a fan of stay-at-base tech support, Sgt. Richmond (Michelle Lukes), know that she now deploys to the field more. And, as it turns out, she's a cool-headed badasss. Section 20 is also assigned a prickly new director. Thankfully, British diplomat Rachel Dalton (played by Rhona Mitra, goddess of cheekbones), looks as good in a military uniform as did the late Colonel Eleanor Grant. Charles Dance - whom I mostly know from GAME OF THRONES and from the bad guy in THE LAST ACTION HERO - is wicked good as this season's central villain.

The body count meter keeps breaking down on this show. Even Jack Bauer is impressed. It'll be a challenge coming up with a similarly scaled threat for Section 20 to combat next. This unit has already thwarted a biological attack and now nuclear winter. What could top those? What's more daunting? I can't wait to find out.",1355529600,59,3111,4.931297709923665

Truth be told, I actually preferred last season to this.  Left out of my title header was well thought out plot.
I simply couldn't relate to the concept of a billionaire Englishmen who considered himself an ""adopted son of Africa"", chucking it all under the guise of making Africa a nuclear power.  I also thought that the finale was a little anti-climatic.

So why the *5 you ask?  Really, a rhetorical question.  If one is ""jonesing"" for a serialized action series (MA rated or otherwise), there are few other options, even factoring in programming from Canada, UK and Australia.

I am curious to see what direction the next season takes and while my personal preference goes towards last season, this season still gets my highest recommendation for fans of the genre.",1353974400,3,787,4.87218045112782

8544075,5,B009SCONXQ,I thought this was going to be typical spy drivel.  The promo photos and ad photos seem  so cheap and corny I assumed this series was a comedic  spoof.  Definitely a case of me judging a book by its cover.  Its seems so tactically accurate and politically believable.  Its so well written and so well acted.  Very pleasantly surprised.,1522368000,,335,4.576271186440678
