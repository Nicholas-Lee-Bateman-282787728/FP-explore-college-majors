5951191,5,B00EXPOCBG,I can't wait to re watch this mind expanding exploration into space inhabitetence and the future of the very fabric of time. Nolan is the next Kubrick.,1421971200,4,151,4.62962962962963
5951192,2,B00EXPOCBG,"I was extremely anxious to see this movie.  I love anything which has to do with venturing into space.  The comparisons with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" catapulted me joyfully into the line on the first day this was at the theaters.

But my enthusiasm slowly waned as the movie progressed at the pace of a nasal drip and with the same amount of suspense. It took an eternity before the movie moved into outer space.  Instead of blasting off, we languish in cornfields and dramatic post-apocalyptic dialogue. I thought this was a Christopher Nolan film, not Ron Howard. I must have been mistaken. I literally had to use the bathroom twice before they even launched their spacecraft, as did other patrons. One desperate patron checked his text messages, and I looked on with envy and empathy rather than my trademark irritation. I understood his succumbing to temptation, the poor fellow. This thing was moving so slowly people were constantly getting up and leaving and then returning, hopeful that the action was soon to begin. I didn't time it with a chronometer, but I estimate at least an hour and a half passes before they launch the damn spaceship. (Suffice it to say, it seemed like an  eternity. That was the primary space-time phenomenon I noted in the movie.) And the extended time spent in this lugubrious, dusty, cornfield world that the characters lived in was depressing and boring. Where was the spectacular space epic? This extended solemn phase was visually off-putting without enhancing the story. It put me to sleep and killed my enthusiasm.  Thus, I may have been less receptive to any inspiration the movie might have later offered. The dire state of Earth and the key relationship between father and daughter could have been readily established in one-fifth the time.

Later, many plot elements seemed vague or unconvincing to me.  For example, what did that drone have to do with anything?  I've asked twenty people that question and no one knows the answer. The clandestine space agency: where did they get supplies and trained personnel in that dying world?

After the team had FINALLY taken off and was in space, it seemed that many conversations about the voyage just went over my head.  There was so much space-lingo (in a conspicuous attempt to convince us that the movie was scientifically valid and get Neil deGrasse-Tyson's seal of approval, unlike ""Gravity"" from a year before) that my mind began to wander.  And I missed other plot developments because much of the dialogue seemed drowned out by the soundtrack, or otherwise muted. And then the really good, heroic guy who had gone to space earlier turns out to be a traitor?  Why??  How??  I never quite  caught that.  And I later deduced there were other developments I had missed while I was trying to wake up from the first half of the movie.

I did like the scene where MM is looking into his former world from some juncture or portal in space.  That was beautifully filmed. The settings on the different planets were creatively done, such as the ice clouds and the huge tidal waves.  The ""overly portentous"" (A.O. Scott's description) soundtrack was also great. Once the film finally moved into space, things did  become more interesting.  But by then we were near two hours into the movie. I was restless and resentful.  It was too late--when I go to see a movie I expect to see a movie, not be held captive in a cinematic prison for the balance of my youthful years.  The interesting phase of this film was just too little, too late.

Overall, when this finally ended three hours later, I felt like I was paroled. Yippee, I'm finally free!! I felt like I had taken a journey across the Universe in real time.  I cannot recall having ever watched a movie that seemed to last so long, especially one with such an extended boring prelude. The first two-thirds of this movie is nothing but psychic inertia killer.  Yes, I probably will watch it at home one more time (it will likely take me three nights to finish this epic).  But I really think this movie would have been so much better if they had cut an hour or more (literally) of the pre-voyage footage and kept it as a space movie rather than a melodramatic post-apocalypse family-farming movie. No compelling suspense is created during that duration, it is a pure Ron Howard production during this phase with all the crying, regrets and apologies--not Christopher Nolan.  Oftentimes less is more, and sometimes a film is vastly expanded by clipping its overly indulgent teary-eyed collateral digressions.",1421971200,16,4544,4.78974358974359
5951193,5,B00EXPOCBG,"He created a movie known as Memento. In 2005, he released a film entitled: Batman Begins that would go on to become a trilogy like no other. And in 2010, his movie Inception became not only a high grossing movie, but offered up a new idea behind dreams. And I hope you are ready, because today I have a great deal to discuss about the movie: Interstellar.

When we meet Cooper we see that he lives on a farm with his son Tom and daughter Murphy. But as it were, Cooper is no ordinary person. Upon the discovery of certain coordinates, he finds a nearby plant. That is where Cooper meets Professor Brand and his daughter Amelia. And due to his past as a NASA pilot, we quickly realize that Earth needs his help.

Interstellar may be the hardest movie that I have had to review thus far, but my hope is that I can be as informative as possible with my review.

The acting in this movie is literally Interstellar's main pro. Matthew McConaughey's resonance is something to behold throughout the movie. With Cooper, he shows a lot of grit plus the willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for a better Earth. And his acting range is without a doubt, top notch. Jessica Chastain does very well in her role as Murphy, the way she captures the character's essence and how quickly she is able to embody the role is something truly artful. MacKenzie Foy plays the younger version of Murphy and I appreciate the sentimentality of the scenes she shares with McConaughey. But even better is Anne Hathaway in her role as Amelia Brand. Not surprisingly, she also is exciting to watch during the movie, and to see her character transition from starting point all the way to the end of Interstellar is especially memorable.

On to the script, it was also interesting/incredible to watch how slow the film started and how it was able to progress while maintaining your attention throughout it's 169 minute screen time. I definitely commend the writing in this movie. The beauty in the movie's  dynamic is apparent; and there were a few times I teared up, and one scene in the 3rd act which I just cried until the end. The music/sound is also something to cheer about, and I would not be all to surprised to see a nomination in this department for Interstellar- as well as one for the visuals.

Even though I won't call Interstellar the best movie of the year, I Will say that it is in fact one of my favorite movies of 2014. And although I have a feeling that some may not like Interstellar as much as I do, if anyone were to ask, I would say GO SEE Interstellar. Not just based purely on what I saw, but ultimately the experience I had with the movie. Interstellar starts out slow, buts builds to something greater. Something truly sensational. A travel across the universe and time that thanks to the talented cast, and a masterful vision by Christopher Nolan is most assuredly

A Great Experience

5951195,4,B00EXPOCBG,"Interstellar is a movie that seemed to get a lot of buzz and publicity without giving out much information about the plot. Before seeing this movie, I saw a lot of promotional interviews with Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, with both being pretty secretive about the plot and letting few details slip. They both said something along the lines of Interstellar being a movie with an underlying story about a father-daughter relationship.

So, I went into the movie knowing it would be about space travel, and apparently it also involved a father and a daughter.  Similar to the trailers and interviews, the movie didn't give too much information away. I hate when movies beat you over the head with information, or try to dumb stuff down and spell things out explicitly to make sure the viewer understands what's going on, so I appreciate the fact that this movie doesn't do that...  However, I felt like the movie may have gone too far the other way, and been too complex or smart to follow in parts.

When the movie begins, we're kind of thrown in without much explanation or backstory. At first I thought the setting was during the Dust Bowl, because the movie started off with talk of all of the dust that coated every surface and destroyed crops, but then there were laptops and flat-screen TVs, reminding me that this was a science fiction-esque movie, so this must obviously take place at some point in the future.  We are introduced to Cooper (McConaughey), who lives with his 10-year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), 15-year-old son Tom (Timothee Chalamet), and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) on a farm. Cooper is a former engineer and pilot, who has reluctantly taken on his job of a farmer. Dust is destroying everything, and farming is the main occupation to ensure there is enough food to keep people from starving.

The story gets underway when Murph thinks there is a ghost in her room, as books keep falling off of her shelves and she thinks that someone is trying to relay some sort of message to her. Cooper eventually decodes the message and discovers coordinates. When he and Murph go to the location identified by those coordinates, they discover a top-secret NASA facility. From there, things happen pretty quickly, and this was where things started getting confusing. Again, I appreciate a movie that doesn't dumb things down for me, but I also expect a movie to explain things in a way that makes sense, and this movie just didn't do that 100% of the time. At this point in the movie, the fact that Cooper discovered the location from a message in Murph's room is explained away as some sort of gravitational anomaly. We are given a better explanation later, but I still found it confusing and with holes. However, part of that may have been due to the fact that it's a science-fiction-esque movie and I'm a bit of a skeptic at times.

At any rate, Cooper is reunited with an old colleague at this facility, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who apparently didn't realize Cooper was alive. Now that he knows this, however, Cooper is immediately recruited to go on a space mission with Brand's daughter (Hathaway) to discover if any other planets are livable, before the dust destroys all of the plants on Earth and destroys mankind.

From there, I really can't give any other details of the plot without giving out spoilers. However, Cooper obviously takes this mission, leaving behind Murph and Tom. I thought the way Cooper said goodbye to his family before going off on this mission was frustrating and unrealistic. Murph is upset that her dad is leaving and pouts in her room, so Cooper just leaves. I'm not sure about you, but if I got offered a job to become an astronaut and go on a space-exploring mission, even if my 10-year-old daughter was understandably upset with me leaving, I wouldn't give her some space at that time.. I'd insist she knew I loved her and hug her goodbye. Also annoying was that Cooper seems pretty upset to leave his daughter, but doesn't really show his son all that much love. He doesn't even say he loves him before driving off. It almost seemed like the character of his son was an afterthought, or that there wasn't enough time to flesh out his role. Plus... Cooper gets the job offer and seemingly heads off on his mission the very next day. Isn't there some sort of training period that should've happened..??

To me, it seemed like Interstellar got a lot of hype, and while I really enjoyed it, I had a few complaints as well. There were a few parts that I thought were intended to be huge plot twists, but that I found to be pretty anticlimactic or obvious already. I also found the movie unnecessarily confusing at times. I'm not a moron, but I had trouble following certain parts, and I wasn't alone. Walking out of the movie, I overheard many people complaining about how confusing the film was, and the 3 people I saw the movie with all agreed they would need to see it again to fully understand everything.

While watching the movie, I was surprised by all of the familiar faces I saw, as the trailers seemed like the movie only contained Hathaway and McConaughey. In addition to those two, Lithgow, and Caine, the movie also featured Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, and Topher Grace. I read that Damon's role in particular was a secret until the movie was released, but to be honest, I'm not really sure what the point of all of the secrecy surrounding the cast and plot was, unless it was just to build hype and mystery. If that was the case, I'd say it worked pretty well. There was a lot of buzz about the movie, and I was pleasantly surprised by all of the well-known actors that made up the cast.

Overall, Interstellar was entertaining, but it did drag in a few spots. One of the best parts of the movie, to me, was the picture and special effects. I saw it in IMAX, which I usually think is a waste of money, but I felt IMAX really brought the movie to life and made it more of an experience. The huge screen, the great graphics, and the sound (and in some parts absence of sound) just added to the experience and elevated the movie for me. While there were a few things about the movie that annoyed me, it didn't take away from how I felt when I left the movie, which was impressed. It was thought-provoking and enjoyable.",1421884800,5,6340,4.626666666666667
5951196,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is truly a work of art. The little bit of negativity if might have received, I think, has more to do with the fact disliking one of Nolan's creations is a popular opinion to have. Of course, any science fiction junkie will appreciate this film, but one of its strengths lies in its ability to appeal to a much wider audience. If you've ever lived on a planet called Earth, you might like this movie.

Nolan tells the story of a near-future humanity that is grasping for its final breaths of air while nature arbitrarily runs its course. The story comes alive through the incredible acting of a more-than-capable cast. McConaughey, Hathaway, Caine, and Chastain all play characters that the audience will come to appreciate and maybe even care for, something you don't typically see in Hollywood with most of them being either scientists or engineers. Watching Interstellar is an immersive experience that is only amplified by Hans Zimmer's fitting score. It is one of Zimmer's best, in my opinion.

One of my favorite aspects of the movie was its scientific accuracy. Although it isn't necessary for an understanding of the plot, a lot of science is thrown in there as a kind of treat for those with the right background. Interstellar is an adventure film presented as science fiction with a story of love at the heart of it all, pun intended. I highly recommend it, and if for no other reason, you should at least check it out for the fantastic special effects.",1421798400,8,1495,4.790697674418604
5951197,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Interstellar is a phenomenal Science Fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. This film features great performance, stunning visuals, and an amazing score by composer Hans Zimmer. When I first went in to see this movie, I was ready for it to be terrible. I knew that Christopher Nolan had to fail sometime. However this movie turned out to be an amazing Sci-fi movie that deserves to be hailed next to Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Ridley Scott's Alien. This movie is one which continues to dazzle, warm you, and amaze you throughout it's entire 3-Hour runtime.",1421798400,11,575,4.877551020408164
5951198,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Even if you're not particularly interested in Sci-Fi movies, ""Interstellar"" is a must see for its outstanding visual excellence and soundtrack. When I watched ""Gravity"" in 2013, I never thought that in less than two years another movie will surpass the high bar that ""Gravity"" had established in outer space visuals.

""Interstellar"" offers a nice introduction, taking place on earth, before beginning its outer space journey. You'll get to know the characters, especially Cooper (Matthew McCaughey), such that after an hour into the movie, you'll start to care deeply about the characters and their fates, which is yet another reason why this movie is so memorable.

The cast have done an amazing job in portraying their characters in unique situations and environments. It must be very difficult and challenging to embody a character that is far away from earth on a mission to save the humankind, and I'm very happy to see talented people like Matthew McCaughey and Anne Hathaway doing such an amazing job.

Overall, ""Interstellar"" is a breathtaking adventure that will make you think about it for days and weeks to come. It may fall short in places such as scientific accuracy, but I believe that everyone involved in the production of ""Interstellar"" did their best to create a great memorable movie. I highly recommend this movie, especially in high definition.",1421798400,593,1365,5.112107623318385

5951274,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Space is one of the most mysterious and complex things known to man. This is beautifully illustrated in the excellent 2014 film Interstellar directed by Christopher Nolan. The film was incredibly written to try and intrigue its audience on the mysteries of space without completely losing them. A good text can be defined as something that meets/exceeds the expectations of all the participants and the larger community at the time and for future relationships. In film this can usually be met if the overall theme is expressed. A formalist critic known as modern or new criticism takes a formal look at the text. The critic will attempt to view the text in isolation and avoid looking at any other social, political, historical, or geographical context as these factors may steer those analyzing the text away from truly understanding the meaning of the text.  A formalist critic would applaud the work of Nolan as he implements an intricate plot, the theme of  isolation/loneliness, as well as events and objects symbolizing different things  into an already mind boggling film.
 The plot is likely the most important aspect of a formalist critics approach which includes the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and stable situation. The exposition was easily the longest portion of the film but for good reason. Of course unless you are an Astronaut already, like me you had no idea how wormholes and others space related topics worked so the exposition was crucial for the understanding in the rest of the plot. An example of this would be when Cooper explains what the wormhole is just before entering. This shows the film still revealing new ideas and information to its audience.  The rising action would be Cooper leaving planet earth and to travel into deep space and try to find a planet which could sustain life.  The climax of the story is when Cooper falls into the complex dimension which was built by someone unknown in the future to save humanity. The falling action would be Cooper waking up and meeting Murph on this strange planet which Murph had essentially created with the help of Cooper and his actions in the wormhole. Finally we leave with Cooper leaving the planet to go and find Dr. Amelia Brand who is still searching for the answer to save universe. All of these events are significant for a formalist critic to look at as they come together to present an overall message of text whether it be the effects of isolation or love across dimensions.
As one could expect from a space surrounding the topic of space, the theme of isolation and loneliness and the effect of that on someone is present throughout the film. These themes live throughout the characters. For example, Dr. Mann in the film was stranded on a planet alone for decades with no hope of survival. Even after Cooper as well as Dr. Amelia Brand find him on his planet he decides to sacrifice others lives to save his own. This shows that he was so desperate to not be alone he would kill others (Romilly) just too selfishly save his own. This is significant to a formalist critic as it shows them an example of the unjust things people may do due to the desperation resulting from isolation.  Another example would be Cooper and his loneliness.  Cooper is a NASA pilot but the world needs farmers rather than those who can explore space. He was never truly taught how to do so while everyone else in the community was raised to farm so consequently he feels alone in the farming community and  is considered an outsider. This shows that even when not truly alone as in physically, you can still be alone emotionally due to no connections with other people. This would be significant to a formalist critic as it once again reveals the meaning of the story and the overall isolation and loneliness in which people face.
 Symbols can be hard to spot when watching a film especially one as complex as Interstellar, but quite a few were present in the film. Dr. Mann is the main symbol throughout the film as he begins as a symbol of hope for NASA as a way to save humanity but he quickly changes into symbol of selfishness and betrayal as I talked about earlier. This shows once again his poisoned mind from the year alone. This would be significant for a formalist critic to look at as Dr. Mann and his obsession with self- preservation could represent any person. The watch which Cooper gives Murph is an incredibly significant symbol in the film. As Cooper gives Murph the watch as he says goodbye it symbolizes their connection across time. Throughout the film we continually see the dusty watch untouched in Murphs room showing her resentment of her father. And in the end when Cooper is communicating through the watch it shows their unbreakable connection. Essentially the watch as a whole symbolizes connection no matter what and this would be significant for a formalist critic to look at as it shows that Cooper and Murph although seemingly alone throughout the film were always together.
 In conclusion, the plot, themes, and symbols looked at from a formalists critic perspective formulate to make a masterpiece. The film not only meets all expectations but instead exceeds  them making it a film worth watching and a perfect example of a good text.  If you are looking for something to get your mental motor running this is the movie for you. I recommend Interstellar to anyone interested in space or willing to learn anything as I found the movie to be incredibly informative. The film looks in depth into multiple themes as well as pushes people to begin looking at some of the consequences environmentally of our actions and hopes for the people to save our planet before it is too late.",1529539200,,5707,4.76417004048583

5951292,5,B00EXPOCBG,"One negative that always bugs me about movies! Why can't they get there science right? One solar cell mounted  on that drone, which wasn't there anyway could in no way power a whole farm. You need surface area, tons of it. A panel of cells 1 square meter in orbit without atmosphere blocking light can't capture more than 1.361 kilowatt of power because that is the total the sun delivers at our earth distance. That might power a few PC's.
But solar cells can  only capture a small fraction of that total energy. Currently no more than 22.5%! So no more than 0.306225 kilowatts per square meter in vacuum, one cheap PC. Even at 100% that drones total surface area isn't enough. But it obviously wasn't covered in solar panel. This is why solar panels aren't mainstream. You have to do the math. And they are very expensive. If memory serves, takes them 20 years to pay for themselves. Hopefully by the 20 years they don't need replacing. Like the windmills which never pay for themselves.

The ending was just. So. Bad! And it's so bad, it makes re-watching the movie not worth it. Basically it tells you things about early events that just make them seem ridiculous. I really liked those early events, mostly to see where the movie went.

I agree with those who think it should have end earlier, and in my future views I will instead assume it end the logical way and turn it off.

I give it two stars because of the good acting, well directed film. A loud if the coolest effects weren't done with computers. That's awesome and explains why they felt so substantive.",1527811200,,747,4.366906474820144

Negative dystopian future setting, combine negative family element, combine further family turmoil. Then add confusing space terms to follow, and even more downer scenarios and far off sad family messages. Then in the end add a touch of really spooky dimensional aspects.

My only complaint is that at times, the ""background"" music becomes a bit overwhelming making the dialog a bit hard to hear.

I might be biased about my review because I think Nolan is genius and I love Hans Zimmer.  If you are into a score, you will appreciate how Zimmer integrate the emotion into the big scenes in the movie. And wisely enough, when something really huge happening, he let the picture tell the story. You will know if you watch it. Anyway, a lot of people complain about the boring first act that stretches the movie to almost 3 hours run time. I, on the other hand, love every minutes of it. To me the beginning is very important to the whole story. Thats why he patiently guides us through it to make us appreciate more what he is trying to accomplish with his final ending.  If you like science fiction and don't analyze every single details of the science (which I never did...because to me it will ruin the experience of watching it ... unless they really made the stuff up), watch this movie to enjoy the story and the special effect.

Spoiler:

The decisions made by the characters once on the exploration mission are detrimental to the story line. Simply put, they make the worst possible decision and there is no plausible explanation for it. This drives the entire story, and it makes the movie unwatchable a second time.

(Super spoiler: Why go to the planet that takes the longest to explore with the least amount of data by making a rash decision? They could have taken a year to decide on what planet to go to and still have only wasted under 10 minutes of planet-side time.

5951666,3,B00EXPOCBG,"Story is probably good...but I couldn't understand 90% of the dialog due to McConaughey's muttering.  Good actor, but his bad habit of whispering when it's not even necessary makes this story more difficult to understand than it already is.  Plus, when he whispers, everyone else has to whisper...the fact the director allowed this behavior is ridiculous.

The sound mix is unbalanced, majorly favoring the music...which, I have to guess, is probably on purpose.

CGI and attention to detail in sets is pretty stellar.  At first, the robot looks ridiculously clunky...but then it starts doing all these amazing acrobatics.",1519516800,2,622,5.3061224489795915

5951668,1,B00EXPOCBG,"Apparently, in the near future, society and education have gone into even more serious decline and NASA has gone underground, such that it must recruit a farmer on a moment's notice to lead an intergalactic space mission.

Yes, that's an ""intergalactic"" space mission, NOT merely an ""interstellar"" mission.

With no obvious funding or public support, NASA discovers a wormhole outside the orbit of Saturn, and they plan to use it to explore and possibly colonize worlds in another GALAXY, which is vastly more ambitious than humdrum ""interstellar"" exploration.

So where did they dig up the title?

The mission into the wormhole leads our intrepid spacefarers to other worlds in another galaxy, alright, where they find Matt Damon stranded on a cold and desolate planet...wait, am I reviewing ""The Martian""?  Nope.

Suffering damage to their spacecraft (thanks to Matt Damon), the surviving astronauts must slingshot around a black hole to escape its inescapable gravity; but our farmer/hero sacrifices himself in the process, actually falling INTO the black hole...where he discovers a tesseract (a multi-dimensional construct of intelligent design) that allows him to peer across space and time and contact his daughter using Morse Code.

Such is the bad science, bad logic and bad story-telling in this dismal Christopher Nolan space fantasy.  Make no mistake, a great deal of money was spent on visual effects for the movie, but the screenwriters must have been paid in chump change, because the story and dialogue are laughable, I tell you.",1519344000,,1545,5.252032520325203

This, like Blade Runner 2049, is smart, elegant film making with a thoughtful script, strong performances, amazing music, superb direction, and a story that requires brain engagement.

You cant go back and change it, so decide what is most important to you and make the best choices that you can right now. If you don't get that message from this story then you weren't watching.

Test out the rig with THIS MOVIE. This movie looks cleaner than any film I've seen, the depth of space, the other planets, the ships, everything looks amazing in 4K. The sound of this movie with a good sound system - nerve rattling in the best way. It vibrated the floor and tickled my eardrums. I've seen this movie 3-5 times. First time in the theatre in such amazing quality from picture, to sound, to size. It was so good, it ruined every other movie ever for me.

The story line had great premise, but many parts seemed to drag on a bit long.  I could overlook that due to good acting, effects and so forth, but in the last part of the movie, I had to wonder if the writers suddenly found out they were late for a cocktail party and just threw things in.  That becomes obvious during the black hole scene and what follows.  Ok, it is worth watching but I would not say it is a great movie...and all of that is due to how everything goes after the black hole situation.

5951834,1,B00EXPOCBG,"So let's first understand where I am coming from.  I read a lot and watch movies.  My favorite sci fi movies are space odyssey 2001, Brazil, Alien.  I also enjoy the original Star Trek franchise.  On the fringe we have Liquid Sky, Solaris (the Tarkovsky version) etc.  So now this ""Interstellar"".  It is an awful, 2 dimensional, pseudo inellectual, horrible film.  It has great actors that make it almost watchable, but there is NO art of story telling here. Stay away from this movie. It has nothing to offer and from the opening scenes immediately jumps the shark and then proceeds to waste more than 2 hours of your time (if you actually stick with it).  You have been warned.",1514851200,,679,4.6

5951836,3,B00EXPOCBG,"I have three problems with movies these days that cause me to prefer older movies. Pushing political agendas, poor plots/stories/writing, and sound. In this case a good story is ruined because a lot of dialogue was drowned out by excessively load music and dramatic effects. Add in large volume changes common in movies these days and you end up almost unable to follow an already challenging story to follow. I could not understand much of the dialogue, but was fortunately able to piece the story together. It doesn't surprise me that the movie industry hasn't been doing very well. I wanted to give it a two instead of a three, but didn't because it had only one of my three problems with movies these days. Back to older movies for me.",1514764800,,739,4.648854961832061

5951863,4,B00EXPOCBG,"This is not the typical blockbuster weve come to praise director Christopher Nolan for (Batman Begins; Inception""). Interstellar is focused on a mature tale wrapped in science, yet at its core is a very simple story that reflects the state of society and the enigma of human emotion. Nolans authorship is all over Interstellar beginning with his fascination of technology where robots (LARS and CASE) are giant iPhones able to assist man programs them for. Nolans common theme of mis-direction with respect toward the villain is profoundly brilliant. The casting of Matt Damon speaks volumes in that his iconic role of Jason Bourne, a man who experiences rebirth out of the water (note the first time Damon appears in Interstellar); a character whom for late 2000s represents government conspiracy. Damons character is already well aware of conspiracy long before beloved Americans Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway show up. Nonetheless, the true heart of Interstellar is parenthood and the furious emotions attached to love. Humanity has a violent nature  nonsensical in desperate times, and ultimately through evolution we will find a way. The repeated poem: Dont go gently into that goodnight is the admirable survival instinct of McConaughey to rage against hardships. Through science, we may not understand why or how the solution comes to be  just like Murphys Law, anything that can happen, regardless of what we my falsely assume will be the outcome.",1514419200,,1462,5.243589743589744

5951865,5,B00EXPOCBG,"How do you make a sci-fi movie, but also keep it personal, human, and emotional, while pleasing the scientific community? That's a question that can't be answered easily, and this film showcases Nolan's sheer genius in his ability to pull it off. You don't need to know the theories behind it, but if you do, you are fully entertained (there isn't any real BS flying around, except in explaining things that we know that we do *not* know at the moment). It is a bit additionally entertaining for the scientist as well, since it gives some fantastical thoughts as to what science might be behind what some might see as ""magic"".

At it's core, it's a story about the American frontier (in space!), but the (in space!) part doesn't feel cheesy at all. Nolan keeps a tight grip on reality, on the reasons why we're out there (or why we aren't), on humanity and exploration, and really creates a master screenplay here.

The only gripe I might have is that the ending collapsed quite quickly on itself from a plot perspective. There was a little bit of writers leeway there for sure but I suppose the ending is how the writer wants to say their final parting words on the tale;I like the vision that is put forth regardless.",1514160000,2,1219,4.561643835616438
5951866,5,B00EXPOCBG,"This is an amazing movie, and visually one of the very few TRUE 4K movies (film, effect, post-production all 4K or nearly 4K) out there. First, if you are not ready to sit down and put your mind into the movie, don't bother watching it. It's complex, and deep. It's about family, selflessness, sacrifice, and the amazing vastness of time and space. I would consider myself a technical person, and a reasonably intelligent person, but only after my third viewing (today, finally got the UHD Blu Ray and watched the third time) do I fully understand everything that was happening. About 3/4 of the way through the movie goes into some pretty crazy territory, but it actually all makes sense once you fully understand what is happening. Things like black holes and worm holes and the effects of gravity and velocity on time and how that would effect the travelers vs. those they left behind are intense subjects. Leaving a dying earth and a seemingly doomed family including young kids behind to have some shot at saving their future is an intense concept to me as a father. There is no way to quickly tell a story this deep or technical, and I can see how it just might be too much for many.

As far s the picture and sound, wow. First one negative, the voice tracks lack gain and is too quiet. On a TV it might not matter, but on a home theater, you will need to crank up the center channel a bit. And the bass / low frequencies are truly something to behold, the cleanest and most powerful I've ever heard on a movie soundtrack...I brought the sub-woofer down about 1.5 db. Once properly balanced, the sound track on this movie will absolutely amaze those with a good home theater system....it will rock you, and to me it surpassed movie theater sound by a good margin. Picture is simply stunning. Shot partly on 35 mm and partly on imax 70 mm, and then combined with 4k and 5.6k visual effects and a 4k digital intermediate, this is as good as it gets today. Unlike most ""4K"" movies that are really fake 4K, this is the real deal...no shortcuts. On my 70"" 4k Samsung TV, it looked truly amazing.

For those of you complaining about the streaming version not impressing you, please understand something. If you want to see REAL 4k quality, get a 4k blu ray player. 4k streams are so compressed and lossy compared to a UHD Blu Ray it's like night and day. Streaming may be the future, but it is not the present, at least not in 4k (and I'm an avid cord-cutter to boot). Neither providers or end users have the bandwidth to process a true UHD Blu Ray quality stream at this time, period, end of story. ""4k"" streams are a JOKE compared to UHD Blu Ray, and a bad joke at that. LG now has $100 UHD Blu Ray players, and it's worth every penny, so consider one if video quality is super important to you your family as it is mine.

For someone who has nearly 3 hours to devote to a pretty intense movie with some of the most amazing video and sound you have every encountered, it's well worth the time. For those wanting something light-hearted and quick-paced, look elsewhere.",1514073600,32,3070,4.439716312056738
5951867,5,B00EXPOCBG,I just finished watching this movie for the second time and it was just as great as the first time. I am always awestruck by how great the acting/effects are.

5951870,5,B00EXPOCBG,"This review is focused on the 4K Ultra-HD Blu-Ray disc and not so much the movie itself.  Movie viewed on 65"" LG OLED C6P using an Oppo 203 Ultra HD Player.

The set comes in a nice 3-disc set (with the 4K, 1080p and blu-ray special features discs) along with a slipcover and digital copy. One gripe about these releases are that despite being 3-disc sets, they come in 2-disc cases (with discs stacked).

Overall.. I thought MOST of the movie looked great! Very impressive, very clean and very sharp. Probably one of the best looking 4K discs in the current Nolan collection. Where it does fall apart are in space (go figure!). These films have artificially raised the black levels, meaning Black is actually a more ""dark grey"". On an OLED TV where Black is actually Black (and space content SHOULD look amazing) you instead see a grey backlighting almost like an LCD TV. Aside from that, it looks great though.

Like the other titles, no Atmos on this release, just DTS-HD-MA 5.1 audio.

Overall, a great upgrade over the Blu-Ray. Not quite perfect, but very close! If you want perfect, check out Dunkirk on 4k!",1513728000,29,1113,4.629441624365482

5952036,3,B00EXPOCBG,"Well, I finally watched this film the other day, and I found it enjoyable---but like my review title says---its no Dark Star!  If you are into these types of movies, I believe you will like Interstellar.  However, there are many opportunities to nitpick away on this.  Dealing with end of humanity type films, I believe the Childhoods End tv miniseries, available on dvd, is superior.  Of course that is based on one of the greatest books by Arthur C. Clarke, so that stacks the deck against Interstellar right off bat.  And, the Childhoods End tv miniseries can't boast the production values of the $150 million spent on Interstellar---it looks stellar, and it should, for that kind of money.  Back to Dark Star---again, if you enjoy this subject matter, you must check out Dark Star---yeah, it is low budget B movie (it was never intended for theatrical release), but it has some scenes that are pure Genius!  And of course, if you like this subject, then go straight to the top with 2001 A Space Odyssey.  Cheers!",1506643200,,1016,4.732954545454546

One star detracted for:  a story with so much hard, realistic science, the plot device that everything depends on to happen falls into the category of ""alien magic"".  Another star detracted for:  this film strives mightily to be original, yet, I saw a season 6 episode of ""Star Trek - Voyager"" made years earlier that was based on almost the exact same premise and was, in some ways, more poignant.  I hate it when someone comes up with a good, original idea that gets credited to some bid budget feature that came along later with a lot more hoopla.

5952103,5,B00EXPOCBG,Great movie,1503878400,,11,5.0
5952104,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Interstellar was, as most know was a film by Christopher Nolan, done after the Batman franchise.  The plot is based on the premise that at some point in the not too distant future earth becomes uninhabitable (basically the entire planet is experiencing a giant ""dust bowl"" like the Great Plains experienced years ago) requiring humans to find a new home.  Matthew McConaughey plays ""Coop"" a pilot recruited to travel through a wormhole with a team carrying human embryos which will be used to ""seed"" potentially habitable planets near a black hole.  Jessica Chastain plays his daughter Murph, whom he leaves behind on earth when she is a child, promising to come back to her one day.  I will not spoil the movie for anyone who has not seen it, but as you can expect things do not go smoothly with the mission.

The movie really is telling the story of the science wrapped up in a human story of a family that is essentially torn apart by time.  It does take some liberties with the science filling in the gaps of what is not known (for example what a black hole really looks like) but, if you watch the extras included with the blu-ray you will see that the image they used for the black hole was modeled from actual math by a physicist who acted as a producer and consultant on the film.  So it really is a movie that those who would classify themselves as science nerds or people who do not understand any of the science can understand.

For those who get the discs, the movie is on its own disc, and the extras are on a second blu-ray.  There are several behind the scenes and making of features that run anywhere from 7-12 min, give or take a couple minutes, and a 50 min feature on the science behind the film, then about 5 different trailers.  All in all a good 2+hours of material, great for a film that clocks in at about 2.5 hours.

Ultimately the film is very well written and acted.  If you are a prime member you can stream it for free on Amazon, but if you are one that likes going through all the bonus material, investing in the physical disc is well worth it.  Especially if you know you already love the movie.",1503878400,6,2127,4.3816793893129775

I don't understand why Murph set a fire on Tom's corn filed, I don't understand Dr. Mann tried to kill Coop. I don't even understand why the story screwed up all the relativity talks in the first half by making Coop communicate with Murph against the arrow of time. Everything falls apart towards the end.

That said, this movie had breathtaking special effects.  The rest of the actors were almost perfectly cast.  John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy (wonderful), Michael Cain, and Matthew McConaughey (he was so great).

5952230,2,B00EXPOCBG,"""Interstellar"" , in turn, concerning a mission to the far reaches of known space to ostensibly find a habitable planet for the population of a dying earth to migrate to, sub themes like love, honor, loyalty and the like are handily mixed in with hazier , not easily rendered subjects, physics and metaphysics alike, which means , of course, that there far too many instances where the otherwise attractive likes of Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway are sitting in their technological huts literally talking about the meaning of life. It is a ponderous exposition that makes the pace of Interstellar sluggish . Nolan, is at an instance where he has no other method to make his movies move forward. Nolan has a problem writing coherent third acts, most notably in his third Batman film and inInception"". Nolan's fondness for large vistas and other sorts of visual exposition, both in ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"". The tendency is chronic in the new film, with grand and sweeping shots of corn fields at the film's beginning and later, on one of the planets being investigated for possible human habitation , large, high contrast panoramas of frozen ice and mountain ranges.

The problem , as usual with Nolan, isn't execution, but duration. The cameras dwell too long on the shots, lingering sleepily. There is in 'Interstellar"", as well, an overbearing music score, soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer; often times Matthew M's trademarked gritty whisper turns into hushed garble. Entire swaths of dialogue are lost in the conflicted soundtrack. It swells up at moments when there is an explanatory bit of conversation going on. Even the least interested person in the matter of how effective music background can be in creating dramatic tension has the innate awareness of when it works and when it does not; how anyone can leave this production and not feel manipulated , coaxed and otherwise coerced by the noise level to a level of nervous anticipation is, I believe, impossible. Direction, motivation and coherence diminish even more and one is puzzled why the music is bearing down on you when nothing interesting is happening. It is a mess, a hurried, hasty, careless mess. Nolan does not engage the senses, he bullies them.

The final sequence of the film is quite fantastic , a fanciful illustration of another kind of existence, and this is a sequence I would watch the movie again for, but there is the nagging feeling that the plot twist at the movie's mid point was less a what-the-hell?!-moment than it was a set up for the sort of deliberate virtuosity that was lurking around the corner. There is always a sense in Nolan's recent work that he was bored with the process of perfecting his script and rushed into production without really a clear vision of what he was trying to convey. It should be noted as well that Nolan mistakes length and vaguely outlined ideas as narrative poetry, as a sign of greater depth. I think it is actually a sign of weight, not gravitas, and that weight sinks the enterprise altogether.",1498867200,,3038,4.8970873786407765

Perhaps the worst thing of all is the robot. It is absolutely the dullest, most unimaginative robot of any sic-fi movie ever. They tried to give him funny lines now and then, which made it so much worse. For long stretches, the ""character"" of the robot was totally abandoned, showing that they really didn't know what to do with it. And the ending was also lame. No spoilers, I'll just say that the core dramatic build-up of the previous two hours was abandoned, just like the robot. Lest I forget: the whole part with Matt Damon was a total digression that didn't add anything to the plot.

The scenes in Space are incredibly beautiful and capture the immensity of the Cosmos. The story is a human story. I'm not usually drawn to Drama, but the emotions and decisions the various characters deal with in this film are ones I feel would be dealt with in real life.

5952453,5,B00EXPOCBG,"I watched this once when I was recuperating from orthopedic surgery...  Today, 5/8/2017, I was checking all my news apps and being an information junkie, I ran across an article about the science behind the making of ""Interstellar""...  It seems that the producers wanted the science AND the special effects to have as much authenticity as possible... So they hired a scientist whose research is within the context of a multidimensional universe... While science, math, et al... have never been a good fit for me, I do get hold of a subject and gnaw on it until I can ""feel comfortable"" with the concepts presented... The producers wanted to present the modern concepts of our four dimensional reality through our senses such that the average ""me"" could somehow ""get"" what all this multidimensional/worm hole/time travel stuff might be...  The scientist and the special affects artists worked together until they were pretty sure that the visual accuracy determined by the scientific mathematical equations was pretty good... Then they all got blown away by the way the science when translated into special affects CREATED a halo around the entrance to the worm hole that neither the artists nor the scientist purposefully intended...  Now, after watching/hearing endless hours about this multidimensional universe stuff and walking away boggled, I was finally able to get it enough for average ""me"" to give up that bone and start gnawing on a new one...  So the scientist is now writing professionally about the halo he never knew was in his calculations... And the artists are now informing their professional community about the halo they never knew they programmed... Science and Art can now gnaw on this bone instead of me... So my job today when I watched ""Interstellar"" for the second time, was to finally internalize the experience of this story including the quest for excitement vs the need for stability; the idea that love can be a conduit of scientific reality shared through our connection, each to the other; and that, at least for me, art and science can better ""inform"" the ""me people"" when working together...

They even fleshed out HAL as the Matt Damon Dr. Mann character, on a secret mission to fulfill at all costs complete with an exploding airlock.  His character was a complete waste of screen time.  The Murph character was a re-vamp of the Jodie Foster ""Contact"" character complete with the dad, the super genius child prodigy, the older mentor, and the time travel. No coincidence that McConaughey was in that movie, too.  Copper's black hole scene was very much like Dave's 2001's.  Plots seemed to end up going nowhere....the Murph/brother confrontation (Murph ended up taking the sister-in-law and nephew back to the bunker, but what happened to the brother?) ...theBrand/love interest conversation with Cooper, Brand happened to mention she was in love with the astronaut on the 3rd planet but the storyline never went anywhere.  Is that the planet she ended up on at the conclusion of the movie?  The older Murph's (played by Ellen Burstyn) death bed scene was odd and could have been so much more.  Cooper walks into his much older daughter's hospital room as she's supposedly dying.  She's surrounded by family, none of which seem to notice that her blackhole-age-affected father just walks in, even though he's the grandfather and great-grandfather to the folks in the room.  Some love/kisses/hand holding between the father and daughter then she just tells him to leave (that no parent should see his child die) and he's like, ""OK. Sure,"" and walks out.  Could have been a so much more emotional scene.

Anne Hathaway's character was cold and flat.  Did she just walk off the Les Mis set?  I expected her to break out in ""I Dreamed A Dream"" at any moment.

Was Matthew McConaughey trying to sound breathy and sexy?  He just ended up sounding like a middle-aged man whistling through his dental implants.

Did they try to make the TARS robot voice sound like McConaughey/Cooper on purpose?  At times it was like Cooper was talking to himself...I had a hard time separating the two, I had to listen for McConaughey's whistling.  And the TARS robot's shape (which just so happened to look like the obelisk in ""2001"") just seemed impractical and comical when it moved quickly.

No, you see a man give his whole life to save our planet and his very beloved children, esp his little girl. The ending is left a bit open and ambiguous which is legitimate and fits the context.

5952534,1,B00EXPOCBG,"This review contains spoilers.

Interstellar is among the worse films I've had the misfortune to sit through, and this is compounded by the staggering amount of goodwill the public has heaped upon it. You can't bring up how awful it is in a conversation. People just shout you down, and it's hard to defend your claim because explaining why it's bad is a little bit complicated. So here we go.

There are two basic types of science fiction.

In the first (and older) type, characters with realistic motivations try to solve some sort of problem in an exotic but (usually) well drawn setting. The science behind technological advancements is revealed to a lesser or greater extent, depending on the creator's style, but there's not a lot of hand waving because that's unsatisfying to the audience and because that moves the piece into the realm of fantasy (see Star Wars). When new concepts appear, we can swallow them because there's generally some basis for such a thing happeningeven just a little. Not every piece of technology or event has to be explained, but things need to exist and happen for a reason. They need to appear to be plausible. Otherwise they just become magic.

None of this absolves the writer(s) from their responsibility to tell a good story.

In the other type, the plot relies on things that are only plausible if you try very hard not to think about them, or if you're not familiar with any of the science behind them. From a writing standpoint, it's just wish fulfillment. The writers wanted to do certain things, but didn't want to go to the effort to justify those things. A lot of modern action movies fall into this category, movies like Transformers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and pretty much any superhero movie. That doesn't make these bad films. They're not going for plausibility.

Interstellar is bad because it pretends to be the first type in order to hide the fact that it's the second. The essence of Interstellar is extravagance without the promised substance. It's that guy you know who uses really big words almost sort of kind of correctly because he's overly concerned about what people think of him.

It's mired in unearned seriousness. Right at the end it asks us to accept that the main character has survived entering a black hole and has used this event to (somehow) communicate with another character many years in the past. In what's supposed to be a poignant scene he communicates by playing light waves like some cosmic cello, making sound through an object on a shelf, saving her from some cataclysm so dull we can't even remember what it was. Okaaaaaaay.

McConaughey, Bog love him, does his best to rescue it all, but he really can't.

Dear reader, we live in the age of bad scifi. Movies like Interstellar make big bucks, so we rarely get movies like Event Horizon, Jurassic Park, or Total Recall. I urge you to stop rewarding laziness and poor writing. Make them earn your money with flash and style (Starship Troopers), amazing characters (Gattaca), or incredible attention to detail and accuracy (The Martian). Stop funding movies that exist only so that Matthew McConaughey can distract you with his good looks while writers and directors get away with not doing their jobs.",1492905600,,3237,4.807553956834532

The major problem I had with this movie is that it tries to explain what's going on with scientific jargon and pseudo science.  It further portrays two main female characters (both 'scientists') as emotionally driven people; one of which is rather illogical in her decisions and reasoning.

Basically, if you drink a beer or four and watch this, you'll probably enjoy it for the schlocky entertainment it is.

The movie is entertaining to the point where many scientific jargon are used throughout.

That said, I think the science was used to just show off the knowledge of relativity theory of the writers and director and not for the person watching the movie.  The whole movie is very long convoluted mess of twists and bends to where it ends at rather head scratching climax.

If the story is to make sense, the whole devices must have been artificially created by a superior beings inside the event horizon of the black hole.  This is total nonsense.  IF that is to be believed for even a SECOND, we are talking about a being so superior that they are able to materialize the warm hole where they want it to as well as setup whole memory bank devices inside the event horizon.  Here is the reason why the movie does NOT make sense.

1. IF a superior being is to create a warm hole for earthlings to push through and find habitable planet, then they can SURELY make sure that 2 of the planets that there MAY BE candidates (but they were not) would be eliminated.  If they want to save humanity, why even make us waste time by having more than 1 habitable planet to explore?

2. Why setup elaborate devices inside the event horizon of the black hole HOPING that someone will drop into it?  (along with the appropriate robot)  so that robot can come up with the formula and human to be able to communicate back in time?  Such a superior beings can SURELY broadcast the formula them selves via Morse code or radio/video waves to the earth?  Heck, make it interesting and move the stars around to form the formula in the night sky for all humanities to see if you want to show the earthlings of your superior intelect/power.

Black holes don't even work how they are shown in this movie... neither does time relativity.  What is relative is the waste of my time watching this crap film.  The main problem started early in the film, dude is left on the space station in orbit of a planet yet the people on the planet are there for less than an hour and yet somehow 23 years go by and the guy left on the station lived thru 23 years... really?  they had enough food and air to support him living there for 23 years?  Also for time to go by that fast that planet would have to be moving at speeds that it clearly wasn't thru space since the stupid station is not very far away and stays within shuttle distance???

But then one evening I wanted to watch some low key entertainment, and started ""Interstellar"". Boy was I wrong! Whether the astrophysics was correct or fanciful was missing the point. This movie was about human drama and feelings and how they can be twisted inside out, backwards and upside down. And then there was the conflict between idealism, family, truth and deception - which is right and which time? Selflessness or selfishness?  The science fiction was the vehicle through which this happened, and that's the way excellent science fiction is supposed to work. I'm a guy, but the final scene between McConaughey and ""Murph"" almost left me crying.
My only hope is that some coked up brain-dead Hollywood director does NOT try to make a sequel or -heaven forbid - a TV series. Doing so would be sacrilege.",1491609600,4,900,4.806451612903226

Drama for the sake of drama wasn't entertaining for me. I couldn't lose myself in the story like I had hoped, especially based on all the glowing praise everyone gave it.
Can't remember if it was aliens or future us that built all the quantum constructs, but either way it doesn't fit. Aliens wouldn't help us (requires Type II+ species to make artificial singularities & wormholes) because we're so far beneath their awareness.

5952655,5,B00EXPOCBG,"Before I get started let me add this disclaimer: I watch movies to be entertained. I don't watch movies looking for flaws in production or with the hopes of pointing out every false statement or fact. When I watch a movie I don't care if it's not 100% realistic. This doesn't mean that I enjoy movies that are complete horse crap but I watch them for fun not as a job or hobby so any and all things mentioned below are solely the opinions of someone watching a movie for enjoyment.

It's 4/2/2017. I've had the ability to watch this movie on Prime for a long time now but never bothered, I just didn't think I was interested in it. Tonight/this morning I decided I wanted to watch a movie and, for whatever reason, I finally decided to watch Interstellar. I generally prefer medieval/fantasy movies with lots of action but sometimes the part of me that loves Star Wars decides on si-fi and I decide to find something to watch. Since I didn't quite feel like renting Arrival this won. I've never regretted not seeing a movie sooner until today. This movie was beautifully written and acted with enough things to blow your mind without overdoing it. The effects are astounding and awe inspiring; nothing short of breathtaking. The story is investing but not in the way you quite expect. If you're a Prime customer I can think of absolutely no reason to not watch this the next chance you have and if you're not I would HIGHLY suggest renting it for a night in. Don't expect a lot of action because there's just enough at the perfect points to keep you interested but instead this movie sucks you in with the suspense and intrigue and that's what ultimately keeps you going.",1491091200,345,1671,4.533112582781457

This film much is closer to the latter. But the bottom line is films are for entertainment and ""Interstellar"" does a great job at it. The actors are terrific, as are the special effects, and its most unique effect is it makes viewers think. Erosion of Earth, food production and over-population is no fictional movie basis. It is happening right now. In America, the richest country on the planet, 1 of every 8 people are malnourished. In Africa it's so bad that hundreds are dying every day and getting worse. By 2050 hunger is likely to be a crisis worldwide. Even ""Soylent Green"" from over 40 years ago dealt with this same problem. So as we view ""Interstellar"" let's not muddle over the good and bad of it, let's enjoy it, indulge in space adventure, understand its message, and try to prevent its premise from ever happening.",1490227200,,996,4.7298850574712645
5952718,5,B00EXPOCBG,"The Paramount Pictures movie entitled ""Interstellar"" is an epic science fiction and adventure movie featuring an absolutely fabulous cast, as well as a premise that is intelligent, captivating, thought-provoking, and inspirational. It begins with a dystopian and devolving planet earth, which is rapidly entering a death spiral, and it subsequently examines the quest for locating a habitable planet to which the human race can be relocated. The science fiction elements of this picture involve a rather imaginative depiction of space travel, time dimensions, and the concept of relativity. It also examines fundamental themes such as family, friendship, determination, survival, and the spirit of exploration and discovery. Although it is one of the longest films that I have seen recently, it definitely required almost three hours in order to develop a coherent and compelling story line. The supremely talented and accomplished cast includes such luminaries as Matthew McConaughey, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, William Devane, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon, and the incomparable Ellen Burstyn. I found ""Interstellar"" to be decidedly engaging and entertaining, and I give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1490140800,5,1264,5.764705882352941

I think the themes on morality, family, love are great but I really have grown to appreciate how what sounded like a fantastical solution on my first viewing grew into an ending that is as worthy as the premise and build up that preceded it.

5952884,3,B00EXPOCBG,"Christopher Nolan is the smartest writer/director in Hollywood, so smart that a lot of people claim his films are over their heads. The master of twists and deception made Batman real, showed us how dreams work in Inception, and brought us inside the dangerous world of magic in the Presitige. In his latest film, Interstellar, Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive. This film does have a great twist in the end and some terrific special effects, but beyond that it is one of the longest and slowest moving films I've seen in years. Once again, Humans have finally destroyed Earth and have gone looking for a new home, but outside our solar system, things are much different than they appear. Time and gravity are different concepts in different regions of space, and the effects on the crew, who had hoped to one day see their families again, diminish with each passing day. Matthew McConaughey stars and as is the case with most of his films, he's terrific. Based on some of the poor choices he made in his younger years, he has a bad rep among critics, but the fact is that he's always fun to watch, and is one of the most intense actors out there today. As for the rest of the film, it's usually Nolan's genius that makes the film unique and special, but in this instance he was too smart for his own good. The story moves very slowly and at times is more than somewhat confusing, not to mention at nearly three hours long, it's a challenge to sit through to even reach his famous twist at the end. Nolan films are something I always look forward to, as they are different and both entertain me and make me think, but in this case, I was just beyond bored and fed up with the whole thing. I guess sometimes even genius takes a holiday.",1488844800,,1781,4.432926829268292

Save yourself 2 hours and watch the Honest Trailer for this movie instead. It's far more entertaining, concise, and pegs this movie perfectly.

The movie instead kept beating me up and wondering is this ever going to get better as a story and be happier or will it loose traction, is humanity going to be saved, are we all going to die in a black void, was Murph ever going to see her father?

I'm not at all trying to diminish some of the great sci-fi movies that have come out in the past say, 20 years, but movies executed this well are few and very far between. Also, it's a Christopher Nolan flick so expect to expend some grey matter over the course of the 2+ hour run-time (whether or not to effect, is up to you).

We live in the age of information and technology. The world is being controlled by fewer and fewer hands. This movie is the result of a threat to the status quo. ""Normal"" people are in danger of discovering truths about our world, this earth we live on.
This movie was created to reinforce and shore up the holes in the screen of lies our current and subsequent generation will challenge greatly.
""Ofcourse we went to the moon"" Reinforcement #1.
""We're meant to be explorers, yearning to search the stars"" Reinforcement #2
The heliocentric model. #3
Movies entertain your mind. They create a controlled environment and can have an effect on our world view. Ideas, motivations, beliefs... our faith. All of these can be affected by a great movie or series of movies when used in conjunction with other material. i.e. school books (written by....?).

5953238,4,B00EXPOCBG,"Good story line and build-up. Liked the acting and tension points as well.  I liked this movie, but the part near the end left me feeling ""really?""",1487289600,,147,4.444444444444445
5953239,3,B00EXPOCBG,"One could argue that this movie is a meditation on the relationship of technology and man, how it makes us more or less human how it makes us more godlike. But that would be giving it far more credit than it deserves. Nolan tries to remake Kubrik's 2001 Space Oddysey for the 21st century and while he fails miserably at it, the film is not without a few pleasures such as the soaring organ music (also reminiscent of 2001) and McConaughey' acting. And while Nolan works within the barren artistic confines of Hollywood, he must take ultimate responsibility for the fiasco. All those wows, pathetic jokes, cowboy bravado and the fact that the earth must be saved and the robot will disobey the human's orders as in the infinitely superior Space Odyssey make for box office success but conspire to ensure that this film is doomed to vanish in the black hole of time. I would call it 2001 Space Melodrama.",1487203200,,903,4.614906832298137

5953266,4,B00EXPOCBG,"While Interstellar was an interesting thought-experiment, too much far-fetched mystery was left unexplained. It's a three-hour sci-fi adventure that tries to pass itself off as science drama. Engaging enough, thanks to the cast.",1487030400,,228,5.9393939393939394

This is a breathtaking story that makes you feel so much, everything here is set for you to experience all kind of emotions, McConaughey's portrayal, Zimmer's score and the visual effects are perfect and those 2 hours 49 mins seem like nothing... that's relativity folks.",1486857600,,335,5.0

5953366,2,B00EXPOCBG,"While the movie had a great premise with trying to find a habitable planet, it had far too much filler content. As a result, the movie ended up being awfully slow. Personally, I didn't connect with the characters either, making this an uninteresting movie that seemed to reach beyond its scope. I wouldn't recommend nor watch again.",1486771200,,332,4.842105263157895

5953368,5,B00EXPOCBG,I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie. I have no words. I was breathless almost the whole time. Well done Christopher Nolan. This by far was the most well written movie I've seen in a very long time. I will most likely buy this and make everyone I know watch it with me.,1486771200,,283,3.982456140350877

5953371,2,B00EXPOCBG,"To long, and not enough interesting locations. The locations were really boring. The story is obvious half way through it and you're honestly waiting impatiently for the end. It has some neat stuff, and a second watch is a tad more interesting now that you know the whole story, you can focus on details. But still... it's not a great movie, my opinion at least.",1486771200,,362,4.584615384615384
5953372,3,B00EXPOCBG,The dialogue & plot mostly was centered around physics and mathematical hypotheses about which I am not educated.  All Greek to me!  Just didn't know what was really happening in this movie.  It would have helped to have known why the earth had become a dust bowl.  Was it drought?  Just had to guess about that.  Minor issue:  I did not like McConaughey as a brunette!,1486771200,,369,4.5
5953502,5,B00EXPOCBG,"It was good.  Filled with Science Fiction, so you need to be into that kind of thing.  I'm not normally a huge fan of sci-fi stuff, but this was entertaining.",1486771200,,158,4.233333333333333
5953503,5,B00EXPOCBG,"The only complaint I have is the  important dialog made unintelligible because of the continually crescendoing music, this happens several times during the movie and during rap up... very irritating. only sci fi movie i have ever seen that made me cry.",1486771200,,252,5.0

5953622,4,B00EXPOCBG,"Interesting take on man made calamity, relativity, multi dimensions, time travel paradox, etc...
Leaves quite a few unanswered questions on many levels but that may be the charm of the movie.
Quite amusing in that man was not able to fix problems on earth but with last minute technological scrambling save the

8610232,1,B00EXPOCBG,"Nothing to do with the quality of the product itself, it arrived timely and pristine. However, the plot was unsettling, but not in a desirable way. The characters really weren't well developed, and left the viewer feeling completely detached.  The last 15 min were okay, but the creepiness of the start did not measure up to the falling-flat at the end. I have heard mixed reviews, it seems you either love it or hate it. It really just made me sad and left me feeling emptier for the watching. I did appreciate SOME of the concepts, certainly made me think outside the box. But it was just a really weird, rather cold box.... like empty space.",1531699200,,644,4.551724137931035
