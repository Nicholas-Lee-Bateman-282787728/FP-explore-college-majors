3872893,4,B0028QM25K,I really like Billy Ray Cyrus - so when I saw this DVD on Amazon - I decided to get it. It is a very good family movie and that is what I like best about Billy Ray. He is a very decent man and doesn't get involved in trashy movies.,1327795200,,231,3.549019607843137

3872895,1,B0028QM25K,"I had this on my shelf for a while. I glanced over occasionally at it wondering if it was any good. I watched it tonight and now I know - it's not. It was worse than I expected. I don't have tv but I have caught a few episodes of Billy's real life daughter's show and it reminded of me that. Only missing the laugh track. Acting? Non-existent. Very disappointed in a one dimensional Heather Locklear. Storyline? Was there one? Patricia Neal a veteran wonderful actress - the only one acting in the movie was stilted as his mom due to the dull story line. Poor thing - she dies (not a spoiler as this does not have a plot and it is obvious this is coming) and her death and funeral are literally only acknowledged for less than one minute of the film. One of the central important issues in the movie is that ""George""  Billy Ray never wrote a song as he promised for his daughter and then he does. All of it is silly, predictable, stupid, shallow and unbelievable. The only good actors were the kids playing Billy Ray and his friends at the beginning of the movie for five minutes and possibly his movie daughter's boyfriend as an addition to his ""band"".The music is ok but would rather have listened to the three good songs on the stereo for a total of nine minutes instead. Yes Billy Ray don't worry you are still hot. Actually it was so bad that it was amusing.",1310256000,,1363,4.303501945525292
3872896,5,B0028QM25K,Must have for all Billy Ray Cyrus lovers. I could watch him all day long.,1268092800,,73,3.933333333333333
3872897,1,B0028QM25K,"Very poor acting. Expected a good story, but the poor acting made it hard to believe.

3872898,1,B0028QM25K,"I love Billy Ray Cyrus and when I saw this DVD advertised on Amazon I had to have it.  Sooo disappointed with the product.  Billy Ray is a successful businessman with a beautiful wife and daughter.  Music has always been his first love and he has reached a stage in his life when he wants to cut back on the corporate stuff and return to his musical roots - much to the annoyance of his less than supportive wife!!  The acting is poor;  there is no chemistry whatever between the two leads and the script doesn't really go anywhere - e.g. there is a potential new love interest thrown in - but nothing really happens and you are left to wonder - do they get it together or don't they?  Finally,and perhaps most important of all - the music doesn't excite.  All in all a great disappointment.",1260230400,,791,4.340136054421769
3872899,4,B0028QM25K,"My wife is a huge Billy Ray fan so I got ""stuck"" watching this movie. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, Billy Ray's not going to win a oscar but is not to bad, Patricia Neal was great as his Mother. The story was good and the music even better, so all in all its a movie worth watching.",1255219200,5,312,3.742424242424242
3872900,4,B0028QM25K,"This movie is a male fantasy handled in a tasteful manner. Forty-something George Barron (Billy Ray Cyrus) appears to have it all-successful real estate business; wife, Pamela (Heather Locklear looking lovely in a thankless role), an ideal teenage daughter, and a lovely home in San Diego.  George attends a class reunion at his disgruntled wife's suggestion and hooks up with his old high school band.  Amazingly they start getting bookings which forces George to examine his career, his marriage and his family life and decide what his priorties really are.

If you are a fan of Billy Ray Cyrus music you will enjoy the covers and the original tunes performed in the movie.  The cast is quite good and includes award winning actress Patricia Neal.  It really showcases the Southern California lifestyle that makes you long for a beach house and a convertible.  This movie will also appeal to fans of Lifetime Channel movies as well.",1248480000,8,934,4.955128205128205

8356621,3,B0028QM25K,"Movie fails to show the importance of marriage and appreciation of your wife and her commitment to the family is not valued it is portrayed as an annoyance and hinderence.  Underestimated the importance of having someone there for you.  Cute movie and good music warn family marriage is very valuable and this movie show it as secondary to dreams.  Not proper priorities. Could have had both low storyline,",1522454400,,406,4.9411764705882355
