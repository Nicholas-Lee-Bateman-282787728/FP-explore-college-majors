2623227,5,B000GYI340,"I did not get to see this series when it was shown on TNT, but I did pick up this dvd set the day it came out. I am a big Stephen King fan and sometimes I cringe when people make movies out of his books and short stories. Having said that, this is well done. You can tell that there is enthusiasm and genuine passion given by the actors and the directors who made this set a pretty solid project. As some have stated some of the stories are good and some are bad, well I would say that most are great and a few are good. I don't feel that any of them are bad.

 I really like the actors that were onboard for this production. William Hurt is great in the very impressive ""Battleground"". He plays a hitman who collects souvenirs from each of his victims and keeps them in a protective case in his lush penthouse. But his recent ""job"" was taking out a big time toy maker. The fun begins when he receives a package of toy soldiers at his door step. Very well done on this episode, great special effects.

The Road Virus Heads North- stars Tom Berenger as a very popular horror writer who picks up a strange painting at a yard sale and finds that the picture foreshadows his impending doom. This also one of the great ones in this set.

Crouch end has good atmosphere and a mysterious setting to add to the uneasy feeling. I liked this episode a lot. And Claire Forlani does a good job with her American accent. If you watch the special feature for this one you can hear that she may be British?

The interview sections on each show are insightful and interesting. Most people comment on their love for Mr. King's books and vision. I think somewhere in his Bangor Maine estate he is proudly watching these.",1162512000,2,1702,4.256965944272446
2623228,3,B000GYI340,"This 8 episode TNT series takes stories from the title book and also one from NIGHT SHIFT and EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL and gives them the standard television treatment.  ALthough not one of the best King adaptations, the acting is above average and a couple of the stories well handled.  Here's a quick rundown:

BATTLEGROUND - William Hurt stars as a hitman besieged by deadly toy soldiers in an episode with no dialogue.  It's all pretty predictable but Hurt is good and the episode maintains a level of suspense and terror.  **** stars.

CROUCH END - Confusing, muddled and hopelessly dull, this spooker focuses on the release of a deadly other dimension.  Claire Forlani and Eion Bailey are trapped in this nightmare. * star.

UMNEY'S LAST CASE - Even the talented William H. Macy in a double role can't save this muddled mishmash about a novelist and his private eye creation who switch places.  The story plods along and then just ends with no resolution.  ** stars (for Macy's efforts).

THE END OF THE WHOLE MESS - intriguing tale about a genius who comes up with a way to stop wars and fighting, but at a crippling cost.  Ron Livingston and Henry Thomas do well in their roles.  *** stars.

THE ROAD VIRUS HEADS NORTH - reminiscent of other King stories, this puzzling tale focuses on Tom Berenger, a man who might have cancer, and his doomed trip home.  The plot never fully explains itself and has a weird resolution.  Marsha Mason co-stara as his sweet aunt.  ** stars.

THE FIFTH QUARTER - Jeremy Sisto and Samantha Mathis give good performances in this thriller about an ex-con and his revenge on the robbers who killed his best friend.  Not a typical King story, but well done. *** stars.

AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR - seriocomic tale follows Richard Thomas who has supposedly died from a heart attack, but as he lays on the coroner's table, he desperately tries to convince them he's alive.  Meanwhile coroner Greta Scacchi and another doctor express their true feelings.  It has good bits of humor and a slithery ending.  **** stars.

YOU KNOW THEY GOT A HELL OF A BAND - TWILIGHT ZONEish tale of a young couple who stumble into a town called Rock and Roll Heaven and find people there who resembled dead rock stars like Janis Joplin and Ricky Nelson.  Although the actors aren't dead ringers, their resemblance is uncanny.  Kim Delaney and Steven Weber do okay but don't seem to be totally into their performances.  ** stars.

Not a classic collection but should please the legion of King fans.",1162166400,4,2500,4.6981566820276495
2623229,5,B000GYI340,"Stephen King, in the course of 30 years, has become a gargantuan commercial success. And why not? He is wicked scary and chillingly entertaining. But part of King's success is attributed to his ability to raise common, fundamental truths and write characters with universal human flaws in his warped, fantastical stories - truths which any audience can latch onto and flaws which everyone can identify with. It's no different with the fabulous TV cable rendition of his Nightmares & Dreamscapes. Themes of isolation, alienation, mortality, the human condition, and social disintegration are touched on.

This lavish, all-out TNT production doesn't stinge in its mini-series adaptation.  I was amazed by the acting talent brought on board: William Hurt, William H. Macy, Kim Delaney (still sexy), Tom Berenger, Samantha Mathis...  Stephen King's stories are magnificently and  thoughtfully realized by wonderful, fully committed acting, production values of superb quality, and across-the-board earnest efforts by the writers and directors, who honor Stephen King by cleaving close to the spirit of the author's works. The 8 episodes are selected for their diverse storylines and are uniformly excellent. They are, in turn, comedic, meditative, tense, gentle, allegorical, apocalyptic, and, YES, scary. Personal favorites of mine are ""Battleground,"" ""Umney's Last Case,"" and ""You Know They Got a Hell of a Band.""

For the completists, of the eight episodes, only five are actually from King's Nightmares and Dreamscapes short story collection. ""Autopsy Room Four"" and ""The Road Virus Heads North"" are from Everything's Eventual, while ""Battlefield"" is from Night Shift. TNT's motto is ""We know Drama."" But, it seems, they also know horror.

Here are the 8 episodes:

""Battleground"" - In this terse, funny, cool f/x-laden episode, William Hurt stars as an icy professional hit man who assassinates the CEO of a prominent toy company and ends up waging a one-man war against living plastic toy soldiers from a Jungle Army Footlocker. The little Savage Commando at the end is awesome! No dialogue in this one, which, in a way, enhances Hurt's acting even more. This episode, pretty much a one-man show, pays homage to the 1975 horror movie Trilogy of Terror, which starred Karen Black and the Twilight Zone's classic ""The Invaders.""

""Crouch End"" - A newlywed American couple, superstitious Doris and the more practical Lonnie (Claire Forlani and Eion Bailey), honeymooning in London, are invited to dinner in the neighborhood of Crouch End. A London cabbie earnestly warns Lonnie not to go there but of course, the couple pays no heed. In Crouch End, strange things begin to happen - and weird, scary denizens begin to menace them - and, gradually, they come to realize they've ended up in a ""thin spot"" - an alternate world. This is an unsettling, spooky tale, as the more they get lost, the more desperate the circumstances become. Another instance of a normal, initially happy couple being faced with weird events and having their personal relationship gradually fall apart.

""Umney's Last Case"" - Clyde Umney is a private eye plying his trade in 1938 whose world is upended when a man who looks just like him, named Sam Landry, shows up, claiming to be from the future of 2005. Sam has been writing a series of detective novels, with Clyde as the leading character. Sam and his wife Linda are suffering from the loss of their child, and Sam can't handle it; so he swaps places with Clyde. Everyman William H. Macy, as usual, is superb in both the roles of Clyde and Sam.

""The End of the Whole Mess"" - Ron Livingston plays an award-winning filmmaker who, in his final hour of life, narrates the story of  how his altruistic brother (Henry Thomas), by chemically finding a cure for all violence, instead brought about the end of the world. This is probably my least favorite story. It has its merits, but it moves at a plodding pace.

""The Road Virus Heads North"" - Richard Kinell (Tom Berenger) is a famous horror writer shockingly diagnosed with a form of cancer. When driving to Boston for a book-signing event, he chances upon a garage sale and purchases a painting of a car travelling on the road. Eerily, this painting gradually changes and grows more menacing as Kinell goes along. Now, is the painting real or is Kinell delusional? Or is the painting, in reality, controlling his destiny? The painting is obviously a metaphor for Kinell's suddenly shortened mortality, but knowing that doesn't diminish the viewing of the episode.

""The Fifth Quarter"" - Willy Evans (Jeremy Sisto) just never has any luck. Caught in a vicious loop of always making wrong choices, he repeatedly ends up in jail. Finally released but  desperate to land that one big score and provide for his hardluck family, he goes in search of a treasure's burial site, aided by one quarter of a treasure map. Will his luck change this time? I couldn't help but root for Willy and his wife Karen (Samantha Mathis), who are inherently good people, but who are stuck in an impoverished situation, with no other recourse but crime. I mean, what would you do? Very good, dramatic character study.

""Autopsy Room Four"" - King does his version of the ""buried alive"" scenario with this ""bottle"" episode. The story is mainly told thru the eyes of Howard Cottrell (Richard Thomas), who is bitten by a snake and pronounced dead. He is taken to the autopsy room, where the coroners begin talk of cutting him open. But here's the thing: Cottrell isn't dead, merely paralyzed, and desperately trying to let the coroners know it. Richard Thomas does a very good job conveying vulnerable, stark terror while - due to his frozen position on the slab - unable to properly emote. This is nerve-wracking stuff.

""You Know They Got a Hell of a Band"" - This is a very cool episode. Kim Delaney and Steven Weber star as a troubled couple on a road trip thru Oregon who get lost and end up in a quaint little town called Rock & Roll Heaven, where the great musical icons of the '60s and '70s are alive and well. It seems like Shangri-La, there's a free concert every night. But, admission comes at a cost: once you enter, you can't leave. Uncanny resemblance between the actors and the musical legends they portray.

I only wish other stories from the Nightmares & Dreamscapes collection had been adapted to the small screen. It would've been interesting to see these following stories interpreted on television: ""Suffer the Little Children,"" ""The Ten O'Clock People,"" ""The House on Maple Street,"" and ""The Doctor's Case"" (a kind-of posthumous Sherlock Holmes story). *Sigh* but you can't have everything. And what we do have, in these 8 stories, are certainly good enough and thought-provoking enough to tide us over until the next Stephen King project.

From what I understand, extras on this beautiful, slipcase three-disc set include additional scenes, featurettes, interviews and production sketches. Running time: 480 minutes. Screen aspect: Original Aspect Ratio - 1.78, Widescreen (16:9 Transfer).",1155427200,125,7057,4.996592844974447
2623230,5,B000GYI340,"After being left out of Showtime's Masters of Horror, Stephen King decided to take a collection of his old stories to make into one hour horror films. At first, I was skeptikal(expecting Rose Red or Kingdom Hospital) but I was suprised at the quality.

The casts for these films plays as a ""who's-who"" of todays horror films (William H. Macy, Jacqueline McKenzie, William Hurt, etc.)

Here is an episode list:

""The Road Virus Heads North""

""The Fifth Quarter""

""Autopsy Room Four""

""You Know They Got A Hell Of A Band""

""Umney's Last Case""

""The End Of The Whole Mess""

""Crouch End""

and

""Battleground""

The best I have seen so far is ""Crouch End"" which was dark and chilling. As with all compilations, some are better than others, but this is a horror fans' dream.

I tried restarting the disc as well as attempting to play it on another player (indicated the disc was not playable) and even on my computer disc drive. Every time I tried to play this disc it would freeze up and black out at the same spot on the disc - just after the helicopter was dispatched.

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

But these are an enjoyable watch . Battleground with William Hurt is great. The Fifth Quarter with Jeremy Sisto is another really
good one. Umney's Last Case is an interesting tale about a writer creating another life and switching roles, not a new concept, but

So maybe, just maybe I expected something half decent in this tv miniseries. I was sadly mistaken. The plot lines in most of these stories are as boring as they are goofy and childish. There really is nothing scary here. The only thing that was 'kinda' scary was the story about the guy lying on the operating table completely awake but unable to move any part of his body. But even that story wasn't without its quirky and scripted dialogue that only Stephen King could come up with. The problem in general with Stephen King's stories is that his characters are shall we say....eccentric. They're quite colorful don't get me wrong, but I don't know of any actual human beings who have that much character to their character. Not to mention the dialogue in Stephen King stories sounds way too quirky and scripted. Anyway, it's hard to believe this miniseries was a work of Stephen King. I honestly expected something more adult, and a lot deeper.",1387756800,3,1110,4.6395939086294415

If your having a weirdathon at your house some Saturday and everyones watching old episodes of the Twilight Zone, tossing in one or two episodes of these might be appropriate.

The End of the Whole Mess was probabaly my favorite but I wouldn't categorize it as horror. Of course if this were a true story, it would absolutely be terrifying. The Fifth Quarter is a very intriguing crime story. Battleground has some awesome effects & is a well rounded story directed by none other than Brian Hanson. Umney's Last Case is a crime drama like no other & William Macy is brilliant, as usual. The short story for You Know They Got a Hell of a Band is the story I remember most from reading the book, but it fails drastically here on film. The Road Virus Heads North may not be the best of the lot but it will creep u out...that smile still gives me the eebie, jeebies. Autopsy & Crouch End are not good on film either but there is enough here to warrant the purchase price & definetly worth watching. The good out numbers the bad & lets face it, no one has the imagination of our King. For us true fans, he is the ""shizznel"" & we love and honor anything with his name attached.

In most of the stories, nothing happens.  There were a couple I could kind of stand to watch, but relatively speaking they were about as good as the worst episodes of a good series.  Seriously, don't waste your time and money on this.  I don't even want my copy anymore and I doubt anybody else does either so I don't even bother trying to sell it; I'd feel terrible taking somebody's money and giving them this in return.  Even if you don't believe me, there is so much else out there to purchase & watch -- why gamble on this?

Some of you may expect me to actually outline why it was boring & why I hated it so much.  Well, you're out of luck.  It was so boring that attempting to rehash any events from it for the sake of in-depth critique would probably put me into a coma.  It's not worth the words.  I would much rather make these vague, but accurate, derogatory statements because it is a kind of catharsis for me -- and because I wanted to be a voice of reason in this sea of apologetic reviews.

Seriously, guys, your idea of a bad rating for this is 3 stars?  3 stars means you may not love it..you may not want to marry it...you may not want to have its children...but you at least wouldn't make fun of it the next day with your friends...you kinda liked it.

This collection of several short stories--some from the tape and some from his book was no disappointment.

The special effects are high end- easily matching the theater of the mind for those who enjoy King's books and tapes. Major actors are involved and the performances are great.  Because it is a collection of short stories you can pick and choose what and when to watch. Although it is hard not to want ""just one more."" I was messmirized by the segment involving toy soldiers in a bizzare battle against a hitman played by William Hurt. In another story, a couple steps out of a taxi ride and ends up in a new world of increasing horror. I found myself whispering don't go there to the characters on screen. Typical of King, all characters are well developed even the tiny toy soldiers. You can't help but like or hate them. You are quickly engaged. King has no road map for his stories and there are multiple surprises and twists from his seemingly bottomless bag of plots. The mounting terror so typical in Kings stories is never lost on this smaller scale. The segments are short i.e. 30+ min but they have the same impact as a 2 hour movie. As an added bonus there are features with the actors commenting on the roles as well directors on how some of those special effects were done. Great acting, special effects and the always talented writing of Stephen King make this video well worth seeing.",1233187200,4,1717,4.58957654723127
2623647,4,B000GYI340,This product contains six short stories that were originally made for TV.... were shown on a cable network as some sort of mini series some time ago.  There are numerous cuts in each title to allow for the cable network to play their commercials (although you do not suffer through them - it just moves on the the next part of the story).  It is slightly annoying but it does cut down on the playing time.  If you like Steven King TV releases this one is about in the middle in terms of the suspense and oddity that we have come to apprcieate.  It is not on par with The Stand or Storm of the Century - both great releases.  I also prefer Cat's Eye to this as far as short stories go but overall is interesting and fun to watch.,1233014400,,728,4.134751773049645

2623649,3,B000GYI340,"Pretty good series of shorts, though I think stretching each story out to an hour wasn't a good idea. Most were okay, but a few felt padded.

The reason that I didn't rate the series higher is that I got the feeling watching this that most of the directors were straight out of film school. I was wondering if this series was in some way related to King's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dollar-baby-project/dp/B0006SJWKK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">dollar baby project</a>.

Easily the best episode was the first one: 'Battleground'. No surprise there, the story was adapted by Richard Matheson's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stir-of-Echoes/dp/B0002DB54A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stir of Echoes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel/dp/B000063UR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel</a>) son and directed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jim-Henson/dp/B000R8YC1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jim Henson</a>'s son Brian.

The rest of the episodes don't feature quite that level of talent, though most are worth a watch. The only one that I didn't like at all was the second episode 'Crouch End'. It's a shame, as the story is terrific, but the direction was very clumsy.

The actors featured do a pretty good job overall. I especially remember William Hurt from 'Battleground', William H. Macy from 'Umney's Last Case', Peter Livingston and Henry Thomas from 'The End of the Whole Mess', Tom Berenger from 'The Road Virus Heads North' and Richard Thomas from 'Autopsy Room Four'

Overall the series is worth a rent. Generally the stories are able to overcome the so-so production values.

I didn't know where else to fit it, but I do have to say that the other stand-out episode was 'The Fifth Quarter'. That was an excellent little nail-biter of an episode.",1228608000,3,1924,6.437984496124031

It was filmed in my home City of Melbourne in Australia and I was lucky enough to be present at the filming of one scene, and I've wanted to see this ever since.

Well worth the purchase, intelligent and entertaining set, some hit and miss as always but Mr King never fails to deliver, I'm a huge fan of his work and am in the beginning stages of collecting all his books and movies based on his work.

2623665,4,B000GYI340,"A miniseries of eight short TV films adapted from Stephen King's rather recent short stories. They are all in the style of the famous Twilight Zone serial but never as dark as the old model. In fact Stephen King in these short stories was trying to use different styles from what he is most known for, horror and terror. So most of the time he did not try to terrify his audience, at most horrify them, but often gross them out, and barely more. So hardly any real violence and extreme fantastic violence. Rather soft estrangement from standard life and the ordinary world of ours. We are thus surprised, disquieted, worried, but never anguished nor frightened. This softening goes along with a theme that is quite common: death and good old time nostalgia. The mind behind these stories has put quite a few years behind his forehead and his probably pot-bellied stomach. The vision is no longer that of a young child, a teenager or a young man who discard and rejects the wisdom coming from older people and for whom older people are danger, the devil, evil, something to get rid of before it dies in their hands. Here we have the vision of an older man, or woman, looking back at the world the way it was when they were young and they compensate the fact it is gone by making it evil. That old time and its characters do not come back into the present to haunt it. Rather the older people of today are transported into that old time of their youth. So it is not Sometimes They Come Back, but Sometimes They Drift Backwards. At time the danger comes from toys, hence children, the next generation, but the danger is seen from the point of view of the older man. The short stories and these short TV films are from an older author who is following the call that comes up from his muscular fiber. He has aged but without really deepening his vision. He has shifted points of view and the present vision is that of an older man probably produced and directed for television in the line of the baby boomers who are starting to get off the labor market and have a lot of time to spend and the desire never to let themselves die into and from inactivity, idleness. So let them have the good old stories about the good old time when they feared nothing but in which they would be absolutely frightened ****less if they had to go there again. Well done but rather too mild to be considered as horror or even fantastic stuff.

2623666,4,B000GYI340,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan, and as such I am usually disappointed in King adaptations.  While, like any anthology show, this one has some stories that are better than others; the whole series is pretty good.
Standouts are ""Battleground"" (with no dialogue, only sound effects) that was so well done that it held you without the dialogue.  William H Macy did a nice job with ""Umney's Last Case"", and ""The End of The Whole Mess""
was also well done.  ""You Know They Got a Hell of a Band"" showcased Steven Weber with the same type of quality performance he gave to King's ""The Shining""; but the celebrity impersonations were a mixed bag.
I can overlook some of the cheesy effects of ""Crouch End"" and enjoyed the basics of the Lovecraftian story, but I found Eion Bailey's performance so bad that I was glad he got it in the end.  ""The Road Virus Head's North"" was fair, while ""Autopsy Room Four"" got to be annoying, and ""The Fifth Quarter"" was pretty unengaging.  So it was definately a mixed bag here.  But the production values were good, the stories excellent, and there were some quality episodes; so I rate this better than a lot of King adaptations and would recommend.",1192492800,2,1171,4.578947368421052

This mini series was filmed in Melbourne Australia, of which we are residents, many fine US and Australian actors were used and many great locations, showcasing this wonderful city we live in, so do yourself a favour, sit down with a bowl of popcorn and watch this mini series, you won't be disappointed, the extras on the dvd are also a welcome addition, very informative and so lacking from many dvd's sold today, the packaging is also first rate, glossy and up market.",1186444800,2,1019,4.425531914893617
2623668,3,B000GYI340,"Disc One:
1. Battleground- A killer for hire recieves an unexpected delivery of toy soldiers. Tiny terrors on a mission of vengeance... This one was one of the best in the set. It actually reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode i once saw.
2. Crouch End- london cabbie warns 2 american honeymooners not to go to ''Crouch End''. This one was bad. Really cheesy effects too.
3. Umney's Last Case- a writer swaps places with a 1930s private eye he created. The plot thickens.. This one wasn't bad, starred William H Macy.

Disc Two:
1. The end of the whole mess- about a filmmaker whos genius brother conducts a worldwide experiment that goes horribly wrong. Nice premise, poor execution. Decent story overall.
2. The Road Virus Heads North- a mysterious painting and a writer. This one started off good then ended lackluster.
3. The Fifth Quarter- ex con and his wife grab their one get rich quick chance to escape a miserable life. It was ok.

Disc Three:
1. Autopsy Room Four- man on the slab is still alive and can hear and feel everything thats going on, Docs think hes dead. This one was probably the best out of them all.
2. You know they got a hell of a band- married couple enters unmapped burg called rock and roll heaven but the price of admission is high. This one was ok.

Maybe some of these would have been better left in the book. With Stephen King's movies and mini-series theres hits and misses. Some of his movies are great and then there are some things like this that would maybe have been better as whole movies per story or not done at all and left in the book. If you're expecting stories as good as the Twilight Zone, don't bother. If you want something decent to entertain you with hits and misses or you are a big Stephen King fan then get it.

jumped too it. I am sorry i did. The multple stories play like a cross between twilght zone and tales from the crypt. Without a host & lacking the suspence:that usally makes up for the gore in a tv series. It's been almost a month sence i struggled through this set of stories. Here are two show that stand out right now the best and the worst. What i thought was the best is""They have a Hell of a Band""This story is about a not so happy couple. The guy really diggs the 50's &60's rock era. He has the car&style too show for it. He's a real Manly/Man ,He shows his girl freind he don't need a map or direction too correct the wrong turn he made on there drive. This great sense of direction brings them too the town,rock and roll heaven-right out of a 50/60 show(think back too the futurish set).Relcutent girl gives in too the prositent guys wims. The plan grab a bite and a couple of slivoniers. This leads them too being trap for all time. The Idol look likes are pretty good to really good. The easyest reckonized

; I thought was:Buddy Holly. The worse was Elvis .Speaking of the worse. The show that gets this award is the one (forgot title)staring the guy who played johnboy on the waltons(whats his name).He's a big time office man in the big city,while in the back woods of a (think it was florida) golf course,hes bit by a snake-declared dead by a doctor who looks way too old too be praticing still. As a result he spends the day in the morgue. Fortunetly the woman in charge is more interested in the guys who are suppose too be her aids. We get too watch a half hour of two people in denile of there feelings-debate on what happened too this apparent dead guy,who in the meantime,is giving a rather droll narretive. Besides being bad this show deos not say much for small southern health care.

2623703,3,B000GYI340,"This show has only one problem - but, to me at least, it's big enough to deserve a loss of two stars. In the interviews provided on the DVD you can listen to directors, screenwriters and actors alike who all praise Stephen King and his story-telling power. They all but fall on their knees when they talk about his short stories. Yet they're hypocrites because they felt the deep need to IMPROVE said stories. It's like: ""Well, of course the stories are good, but look, WE can make them better!"" Therefore, a true King fan will incredulously watch a different (and often WORSE) version of the story he knows, wondering why these changes were made and how anyone could possibly believe they could improve the author's original.

The ridiculous Rambo-doppelganger in ""Battleground""? Not in the story. The wife driven to suicide, whose jump from a high building can mysteriously be seen in two worlds in ""Umney's Last Case""? Not in the story. Or, worst of all, the completely brainless ending of ""Crouch End"", with a twist that is so senseless that you can only call it embarrassing. There's more: Kinnell's portrayal as a possible cancer patient gives ""The Road Virus Heads North"" a totally new direction not intended by King - this climaxes with the villain's words 'I'm what you don't know: I'm your fear' - if you believe it or not.

So why are there even three stars? Because the casting and the acting are great (with the exception of the nurse in ""Autopsy Room Four"", who I found to be completely unconvincing), the setups and the atmosphere are worthy of King and because I do support the idea of finally filming these great stories. I hope for a continuation of the series - but with the aim to film the stories, not to improve them for the worse.",1172016000,13,1753,4.651612903225806

No, it is not the best bunch of King adaptations around, but it is entertaining, clever, and full of those King-isms that I for one have grown to anticipate and love, particularly when Mick Garris is behind the camera!

There are Eight stories here, all around 45min each. I am two-thirds of the way through the bunch, so I'll spare you any major breakdowns of each story. Many other reviewers have covered this ground already, anyway.

All I would like to really say is that if you are a fan of Stephen King's TV and big-screen adaptations, it would be a good idea to give this one a look!",1169424000,2,758,4.478260869565218
2623705,4,B000GYI340,"This series is the true definition of a mixed bag!  There are truly wonderful moments, and some truly awful ones as well.  I can't help but think that better (or at least more cinematic) stories could have been picked.  Stephen King has written just a few (!!!!).

First of all, the production values of all episodes are impeccable.  Most of the shows don't call for too much in the way of special effects, and that's fine.  We are thus unable to sense the inevitable lower budgets that such a TV show would have.  The DVD's themselves are also well done, with decent bonus materials, nice packaging, etc.  You'll certainly be well entertained in general.

BATTLEGROUND is one of my favorite King short stories of all time.  I was absolutely thrilled to see that they finally made it into a ""movie.""  It was put together to follow the original story very closely.  Casting William Hurt was a great step, too.  The ""special effects"" are very convincing for the most part, and the story, while totally ridiculous on one hand, is just perfect for such a short format.  We see the situation, are asked to just go with it, and it moves quickly to a satisfying conclusion.  Also, the show has NO dialogue.  There are one or two moments when it's hard to believe a word wasn't uttered instead of a grunt, overall it was an effective little extra.  A

CROUCH END is probably the closest thing to a straight out horror story in this collection.  The plot itself is simple, and frankly, not very original.  It IS an homage to HP Lovecraft...his plots were seldom anything to get worked up about either.  This story is all mood and atmosphere.  And I can say that all my family members were quite neatly given the creeps by this episode.  A high point.  A-

UMNEY'S LAST CASE is a terrific story...90% of the way through.  It has great performances (who doesn't  like William Macy), lovely art direction and a brisk little script.  But the ending just fizzles, in my opinion.  Somehow we get no emotional payoff and the ending is actually just a little confusing...as in, ""that's it, it's just stopping right there?""  B

END OF THE WHOLE MESS plays like a modern day Twilight Zone episode.  It's more sci-fi lite with an ironic twist.  But for what it is, it's well done, and I liked seeing Ron Livingston in something that was against type.  It's well written and acted, but emotionally uninvolving.  B

THE ROAD VIRUS HEADS NORTH  Another creepy story, about a writer who picks up a painting at a garage sale, and as he travels north, the figures in the painting get closer and closer to him.  It's certainly a creepy idea.  The episode is well acted and is the most graphically violent of all the shows in this set.  The ending reminds me very much (too much?) of the pilot episode of NIGHT GALLERY.  The overall effect is creepy, but again, I think the ending was a bit weak.  B

THE FIFTH QUARTER  This one feels like an Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode in modern times.  More crime drama with some twists.  It is quite well acted (I like seeing Jeremy Sisto and Samantha Mathis both)...but it doesn't fit in a collection entitled Nightmares and Dreamscapes.  It's neither.  I don't remember ever reading this story, either.  While I didn't mind it, I kept wishing it had been substituted for something more ""Stephen Kingish"".  B-

AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR  Yikes...the bottom of the barrel.  Absolutely NOT a decent cinematic story.  To read it is one thing, but to see the situation stretched out awkwardly to fit the allotted time...bad, bad, bad.  It's the classic story of a guy on the slab at the morgue, still alive, but no one knows it and he is crying out in his head.  It's close to a ""buried alive"" story.  But IF it had to be made into a film, 20 minutes would have sufficed.  Instead, we are forced to endure lots of scenes showing us the events leading up to the man's current situation.  Scenes that are mundane, and VERY badly acted by Richard Thomas.  (I'll admit it, I am NOT a Richard Thomas fan at all, but here he hits a new low).  He's also the narrator, so it's mostly his voice we have to endure throughout.  And there's a laughable subplot about a burgeoning romance between the coroner and one of her assistants.  This is one of the worst Stephen King adaptations ever.  D-

YOU KNOW THEY GOT A HELL OF A BAND  This is a pretty good story, about a little town not on any map that just might be hell.  But I think it played better on the page.  Lots of dead rock and roll stars appear in the story...one the page, we could picture the real people.  On screen, we get a lot of second rate impersonators.  And it's the kind of story where watching it makes you want to yell at the main characters ""don't do that, you idiot!""  because they keep making boneheaded moves you wouldn't want them too.  Also, perennial Stephen King star Steven Weber is probably not quite the right guy for his role, although Kim Delaney is fine.  It was okay viewing, but not the highpoint of the series, either.  C

So, as you can see, this is a mixed bag, but more good than bad.  I'm giving it 4 stars overall, although I would still advise against watching the Richard Thomas episode at all.  If it were a movie, it could become a cult classic bad movie.  As a TV production, it's just kinda gross.",1169078400,5,5291,4.488421052631579
