3936590,4,B002IJQ34I,"This documentary uses metal music, and often dark graphics, as well as expert interviews, to recount the Mayan prophecy that the End of Days will come on December 21st, also known as The Dark Rift or The Road to the Underworld. Interesting and easy to watch.",1258761600,4,258,4.630434782608695
3936591,5,B002IJQ34I,"I have watched this video about five times now, as the information within it is so deliciously mind-blowing that I can't
always wrap my brain around it.  The theories and perspectives on time and time travel are so interesting, and actually a lot of fun to consider. It is so incredibly refreshing - in this frenetic period of ""2012 Apocalypse Mania"" that is being
stirred up by Hollywood - to watch something intelligent, thought-provoking, utterly engrossing and completely positive.

I am going to order multiple copies of this DVD and give it as gifts.  I recommend watching it in a group and pausing it to discuss the theories as
they come up.  I guarantee that even the most ardent 2012 fan hasn't heard all of these concepts.  But in addition to all of the mind bending time elements,
there is an ultimately spiritual message that this is an unparalleled time of ""evolutionary opportunity"" for all of us.  It is our choice to seize this time
and create a new and more beautiful world.

Anyone who wants to see 2012 from a completely new - and yet ancient!- perspective MUST see this!",1257811200,38,1090,4.675392670157068
3936592,5,B002IJQ34I,"GOOD 2012 INFO.  DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE HARD ROCK MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING OF THE DVD, HOWEVER, THE INFORMATION IN THE REST OF THE DVD IS VERY INTERESTING.  I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL PREPARE BECAUSE SO MUCH IS ALREADY HAPPENING AND CHANGING IN OUR WORLD SUCH AS THE SWINE FLU PANDEMIC, AND COLLAPSED ECONOMY.  I HAVE A STRONG FEELING THAT WE WILL FACE MANY MORE CHALLENGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AND REALLY SHOULD BE PREARE INSTEAD OF BEING SKEPTICAL.

3936601,1,B002IJQ34I,"This video was a waste of my money.  The information was not based on science, nor was it a true documentary about Mayan culture and prophecy.",1320019200,,142,4.461538461538462
3936602,4,B002IJQ34I,REALLY like this. Has several points of view...from the Mayan  calendar...to the I Ching....to computer calculatoins and others.  Just flat out interezting. The only thing I did not like was the heavy metal music selection. What a let down on that aspect.,1315526400,,255,5.0476190476190474
3936603,5,B002IJQ34I,"After a rocky start, which included a loud heavy metal introduction(which actually had me confused, and thinking about just shutting it off?),.....I BECAME GLUED TO MY SEAT! I thought the speakers all had tremendous insight, and fascinating NEW information. This shortly became the most comprehensive documentary that I've seen on 2012 thus far, and would recommend it to anyone.",1310601600,,379,5.440677966101695
3936604,3,B002IJQ34I,I mean it might just be me but metal doesn't inspire trust in the film. In my honest opinion the movie may be good but i'll never know do to the lame mismatched music that keeps distracting from the theme...,1301356800,,207,4.2
3936605,4,B002IJQ34I,"I have heard a lot of theories surrounding 2012 and a potential apocalypse. If you are remotely interested in the topic or are in fear of some catastrophe nearing, you should watch this film. The content presented is thorough, detailed and truly worth considering. This film really opened my eyes to the Mayan prophecies and the theories presented were very thought provoking. If you are one of those who fears 2012 you'll feel a little better after watching this. I was just blown away by how much information was presented. This is a ""must see"" for everyone interested in the Mayan prophecies.",1294272000,,595,4.8431372549019605

3936607,5,B002IJQ34I,"There are a lot of documentaries, books, and other such media that are jumping all over the whole 2012 scenario. Some are good, others, not so much. This one, fortunately, can be counted as one of the good ones.

As mentioned on this DVD, we have had a lot of exposure to the 2012 phenomenon for a while. The concept showed up on the last episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-The-Complete-Ninth-Season-Slim-Set/dp/B000EXDS3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files - The Complete Ninth Season (Slim Set)</a>.

So what is this whole thing with 2012? The date, December 21, 2012, the Winter Solstice, is supposedly the end of the Mayan Calendar and has been heralded by many as the end of time. Of course, with all of the disasters going on right now (the Gulf oil spill, earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, etc), it's not difficult for people who already believed that things were coming to an end that these are signs of impending doom. The fact is, there is a lot that is unknown about the Mayans and there are suggestions that it might not necessarily be the end per se, but the beginning of something new (the Mayans have us in the 5th age, 12/21/2012 is the beginning of the 6th age).

Instead of a documentary on impending doom, this one actually gives a bit of hope and is worthwhile to watch. Give it a go, especially if you have an interest in the 2012 phenomenon.",1277251200,6,1830,6.057915057915058
3936608,4,B002IJQ34I,"A friend of mine gave me a copy of this DVD and I thought, ""Oh great, another 2012 nail-biter.""  I mean, how many more doom-and-gloom stories can we hear?  People always tend to look at the bleak side of things, especially when it comes to the supposed end of times.  Sure, the Mayan's placed great importance on this date, but that doesn't mean the Earth will dissolve and us with it, or a giant meteor will annihilate us, or a huge (insert noun here) will wipe us out.

What if 2012 is simply a new beginning?  Maybe even a second chance for human beings?  I thoroughly believe that something will take place in 2012 and it won't be the fire and brimstone so many are afraid of.  After watching 2012 Mayan Prophecy and the Shift of the Ages I feel even more comforted and my mind has expanded as well.  There are theories in this DVD that will blow you away!  We need to seize the moment more and grasp opportunities as they arise rather than going through life heedless and mindless.  This film will surely offer a wake up call to all who view it.",1274140800,7,1050,4.311224489795919
3936609,3,B002IJQ34I,"Anybody doing anything on December 12th, 2012?  Wanna come over and watch Armageddon come in?  Having just made it through 9/9/9, which is after all, 666 upside down, I'm not looking forward to 10/10/10, 11/11/11 or (gulp) 12/12/12.  If you paid more attention in math class, maybe you can figure out why the Mayan numbers add up to the world ending in 2012--it didn't compute for me.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed this movie for its Death Rock music and paranoid vision (turned hopeful at the end).  I found the Mayan Calendar explanation fascinating, and aside from the prophecy, would like to know more about it.  What's interesting is this film postulates the ""significant event"" in 2012 might be positive, the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, as the song says.  Let's hope so.",1273708800,4,775,4.825757575757576

This movie is terrible the men speaking in it put me to sleep! This is a subject that I am very interested in but I could not keep my eyes open! very boring! If you want to hear some truth about 2012

8370956,4,B002IJQ34I,"What the Mayans predicted is still so relevant. The news cooked up a dramatic apocalypse for us in 2012. It's tempting to say that what happened was less dramatic--but that simply isn't so! What is happening now is changing the course of our world forever. Change is scary, & that's why the media focuses on peril...but change should be embraced & nurtured.

Everyone seems to be obsessed with ""dooms day prepping"" and I wanted to show them where all of the 'scare' originated.  This movie has terrible graphics, narration and story line.  it does not captivate attention.  I think the Maya culture and calendar is a really interesting thing, one can not help be interested in it.  However, this dvd would bore anyone.  I would reconsider this purchase.",1355184000,,531,4.717391304347826

This is no Hollywood - special effects demonstration, but facts.

It's timely and credible. Very well done. Not a bit of sensationalism.

The music (classical) is wonderful... It's noted at the end credits.

Highly recommended.
