7908463,3,B00000FDPU,the reviewers often devaluate a video if it has subtitles in english. i think this only concerns lazy anglophones.,959731200,,114,5.052631578947368
7908464,3,B00000FDPU,"I found this a very decent production of The Abduction but, again, no subtitles are provided by Opera d'Oro.  May I suggest you get the Deutsche Gramophone video of this absolutely delighful Turkish tale of love and  forgiveness: conducted by Karl Bohm and with beautiful performances by  Edita Gruberova and Francisco Araiza. And with subtitles!  The music is, of  course, Mozart at his best, which means some of the most beautiful ever  written.",948844800,19,447,5.054794520547945
7908465,3,B00000FDPU,"Despite some strange staging and some dull acting, this is a pretty nicely sung version. But it has no subtitles and that might be a bad drawback during the long passages of spoken German dialogue.",920592000,4,197,4.6571428571428575
