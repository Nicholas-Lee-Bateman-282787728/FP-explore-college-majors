2510602,2,B000E991NE,Nothing about the seven day war here. You need to re-write the description of this video. Its about his travels to other countries.,1437091200,4,131,4.739130434782608
2510603,5,B000E991NE,"I do like how this clarified the truth about Mary Magdalene. And the story on Lady of Fatima was very interesting. Although I knew all about it - my spouse and neighbor did not -- so this was enlightening for them.
However - the title was misleading for me -- I thought it was going to be about Biblical Women -- Deborah - Holga - Anna- Ruth - Ester - etc...",1396828800,,358,4.056338028169014

2510617,1,B000E991NE,Don't watch this if you love truth.  It is not about Megiddo.  It is the spouting of Apocryphal books as though they are absolute.  I don't appreciate it.,1451174400,,154,4.428571428571429

2510621,4,B000E991NE,"It was the wrong video. It is a documentary about where Jesus might have spent His early years. Amazon needs to check this out!

2510624,5,B000E991NE,"This is highlariously funny film that left the dumbed down and stupid population clueless regarding its parody within a parody.!  People who missed the point of this film are too inane themselves to catch all of the innuendo and by the script writers about the film within a film and how poor the quality of most monster/alien/slasher films are these days.  This is a take-off of all of those genre films and the midget/dwarf is brilliant!  Beaucoup applause for this rare and genius Mel Brooks style humor!  Keep up the good werks mi amigos!  Better than the Wayan's films or those of the Zucker Bros too!  Hope your troupe makes more.  The Viet Nam Vets ball-cap was not missed either for its sense of ironic humor ~ over the top, boys!",1441238400,,738,4.587786259541985
