8215747,1,B000UYX4OA,I am very disappointed with this DVD and I will give it away for free to my nephews.  Absolutely nothing new - almost no footage of Becks.  Just a whole bunch of nothing... absolutely nothing.,1215475200,,192,4.457142857142857
8215748,2,B000UYX4OA,"This DVD is mildly entertaining, but it relies much too heavily on the accounts of journalists and pundits, rather than anyone close to David Beckham. It glosses over his youth experiences to focus on Beckham's celebrity status and has very little on-field football footage. Most of the football stories are relayed via photos; you can find more dynamic material on YouTube for free.

Considered that Beckham is still writing great new chapters to his own story with the Galaxy and his resurrection in Capello's England squad, we'll hopefully see a better retrospective on his career sometime in the future. This one is worth skipping.",1212969600,,635,5.105769230769231
8215749,3,B000UYX4OA,"The DVD provided some insights into Beckham's history and personality I wasn't aware of - almost exclusively from sports writers and others' accounts (as this is an 'unauthorized' biography. Not a lot of video of Beckham in action and/or being interviewed. For real David Beckham fans, there's probably better DVDs out there.",1211760000,,325,5.269230769230769
