2471893,2,B000CRR33I,"While the film footage makes watching this series worthwhile, there is more than a hint of historical revisionism extant throughout the narrative. The episode ""Why We Fight"" illustrates this through letters from soldiers who complained about officers getting better treatment, divisions among the troops along racial and other lines, resistance to ""propaganda"" in training, etc. and even a letter from George H.W. Bush about the latter issue. The episode talks about how most soldiers didn't fight willingly and didn't fight out of patriotism so much as just to survive. The objective of the producer of this series and the tenor of the narrative overall seems to be to denigrate on the role of the USA in saving the lives of millions of people worldwide, and to cast doubt about America's role as a major force for good in the world. It's not coincidental that ""progressives"" are largely responsible for film production in this country, even these  so-called documentaries which are often themselves, a form of propaganda.",1355184000,,1023,5.162650602409639
2471894,4,B000CRR33I,Footage I'd never seen before and I thought I'd seen it all. Very good and very complete - I've even watched some of it again.,1353888000,,126,4.08
2471895,4,B000CRR33I,"This is a very interesting series to watch WWII from the perspective of America in the war. I am American and all of the patriotism is nice. But if you're looking for a well rounded documentary about the entire war, this series is probably not for you. I was looking for something that would show how Germany grew to power and how they went about starting the war, then how each individual country got involved. This does not have very much of that.",1344211200,,449,4.421686746987952
2471896,5,B000CRR33I,"I teach and write military history for a living and have done two books on WWII. Documentaries on the ""Big One"" must be in the high hundreds and include some of the best efforts in the genre (the classic ""The World at War"" from the 70's is remarkable and the BBC series of WWII subjects put out around 2000 rank up there). Most are pretty average. This one belongs right at the top. It is not ""Gee, Neat, It's WWII in Color!"" that could describe some series. Instead it is a wonderfully written series that covers all facets of the American war effort. Narrated by the splendid actor Peter Coyote, they dispense with ""talking head"" historians but include excerpts from letters, some keyed to the events on film. There are 17 episodes of 45 minutes a head, so a lot of ground is covered. (The episode on morale is puts the misery and boredom back into WWII where it does belong.) The producers don't wear the historical research on their sleeves, but as one who has made the study of this war a career, I can testify that it is there. John Ellis, a fine WWII historian is listed as a consultant, but the writers were obviously very up to date on the whole ""experience of war"" genre of military history popular for the last 25 years. Consider the color film, much of it surprisingly good and done on genuine color film, to be welcome bonus. Highest recommendations.",1327276800,7,1363,4.5
2471897,5,B000CRR33I,"This has to be one of the best war dvd's you can buy. They have made a show about how it affected people at home (homefront)
submarine force,navy,air force. They have done a great job about how the war affected everyone that was around at the time of world war 2. How the soldiers were able to have a bit of time out (at ease),and even the aftermath. The series was narrated by PETER COYOTE who done a fantastic job and has done a lot of work for KEN BURNS and others and i think the narrator is an important part of any documentary and can make or break.
The episodes are Disc 1 INTO THE BREACH, FACE TO FACE, AIR WAR, AFTERMATH
  Disc 2 AT EASE, ANCHORS AWAY, WHY WE FIGHT
  Disc 3 FUELING THE FIGHT, SILENT AND DEEP, HOMEFRONT, THE PRICE OF WAR
  Disc 4 VICTORY, AFTERMATH, MAN AND MACHINE
  Disc 5 CLEARING THE WAY, COVERING WAR AND DRESSED TO KILL
It's just a shame they didn't put them in a better order but that's no big deal. This box set is a must for anybody and as someone else said it should be part of our history class as it looks at so many different aspects of war. I have now watched this many times and i just don't get bored as i do with nearly all of my other DVD'S.",1307664000,8,1186,4.038461538461538
2471898,5,B000CRR33I,"This enormously important and historically revelant event was properly called World War II. It showed the depth of what war does to those it touches and it provides factual evidence of what we all humans can do on our evil and inhumane sides.  In a nutshell, it lays bear the depth of our capacity to hate and to do hatred to each other.  Yet, war does not distort, in any way. As a cruel, harmful and natural tragedy, it performs like the hurricane, tornado or tsunami.  And, it too earns the title of a natural disaster.  We humans wrap ourselves in the most stirring images of goodness and kindness.  In truth, we can do enormous good and, likewise, tremendous evil.  That truth is depicted in no better medium than war.  And, the reality of war and the nakedness of our capacity for bigotry and inhumanity is captured in videos like this one in color.  Let's keep them, watch them and share them in the hope that they will provoke us humans to make a stronger effort to break from ""pecking orders"", ""pack leaders"" and racial prejudicies.",1303430400,3,1041,4.559139784946237
2471899,5,B000CRR33I,"I was actually looking for a different series than this (which apparently is out of production), but what a great alternative find.  I don't have cable, thus no History Channel, but wow, this is a fantastic collection of color footage (varying quality, some very sharp and clear, some very poor and broken) along with readings of letters and various facts and statistics.  I've just barely gotten to the second disc and I'm impressed.  This series has so much footage, letter readings, etc. that you really get a feel for what it must have been like for people to go through this war, both the good times and the bad.  It honestly makes me wonder how this current generation of young people would be able to respond to such a desperate situation like WWII.  This series makes you see how the current Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as bad as they are, are nowhere near the terror WWII brought upon the world.  So humbling and very highly recommended!  Even for middle and high schools, and hopefully you might consider buying one for local your library.",1280275200,5,1048,4.693989071038251
2471900,5,B000CRR33I,"This series was done in 2001, but it's not airing on TV lately.  I'm afraid it will not be available on DVD in the future, due to a lack of demand.  Not a dramatization - real footage, with firsthand accounts in the audio.  Too bad it doesn't have closed captions.  Even so, I'm very happy I got it.",1271635200,17,299,4.103448275862069
2471901,5,B000CRR33I,"The films vividly depict the horror & brutality of warfare. This series should be mandatory viewing by all High School students so they get a true picture and better appreciation of what their fellow countrymen where willing to do in order to allow them to enjoy the freedoms they have.  As a combat infantryman from the Korean War, I feel that I can speak with some authority.  Paul Freeland",1249171200,36,392,4.666666666666667
2471902,5,B000CRR33I,"If you've seen any of the ""Color of War"" series on The History Channel and found them interesting, this DVD set is a must have. It contains every episode. I found the price to be reasonable and enjoyed watching it without any bothersome commercials.",1171152000,48,249,4.681818181818182

8101246,5,B000CRR33I,"For history collectors of WW II, real footage of WW II. How real the soldiers entered into the war & the folks back home during the war. There was so much going on in those years of war in the world. This is the reason I bought The Color of War to add onto my collection of documentaries of WW II. I had Uncles in this war & my close friends fathers fought in it, none spoke of it. They all had seen to much death & destruction. The letter writing of GIs of which my Aunt had stuffed away in her attic was telling in these videos. This is one of the top documentaries out of WW II.",1463097600,,581,3.8907563025210083
8101247,1,B000CRR33I,"I don't understand the necessity of rewriting history - particularly when the history rewritten is General Dwight Eisenhower's message to the Allied troops on D-day.  In the episode ""D-day"" of this series, Eisenhower's message to the Allied troops is accurately recited - except for the last sentence WHICH IS COMPLETELY OMITTED.  I guess it is too politically incorrect.  Here is the last sentence of his ACTUAL message to the troops: ""And let us beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking.""  See http://www.kansasheritage.org/abilene/ikespeech.html.

I wonder what other politically incorrect details the History Channel is choosing to eliminate from history.  Maybe the History Channel should be renamed to ""The History Channel as the Politically Correct Want You to Understand It.""",1419206400,,817,5.6016260162601625

8101249,5,B000CRR33I,The Colour of War is a very informative history of WW2 The younger generation would appreciate the sacrifices in the cause of freedom,1391904000,,133,4.826086956521739
8101250,5,B000CRR33I,I was prepared for just another WWII documentary but this was not the case. This set was very informative and different. I learned a lot of new and different aspects of the men who fought the war. I found it to be very moving and real. It made me feel like I was there with them. It was not all battle scenes and combat footage. It was about the real people who fought. I highly recommend this set to any wishing to see WWII from a different perspective.,1383004800,2,454,4.170454545454546

8101253,4,B000CRR33I,"If your a history buff and want to know about the wars which involved the United States, this is a video you should add to your collection.  it's put out by the History Channel and their historic programs are top notch.",1370736000,,219,4.341463414634147
8101254,5,B000CRR33I,"'The Color of War' is a amazing series on the American Experience in World War II that the History Channel did in 2001-2002. This DVD contains all of the episodes. The transfer and sound quality is top notch. This was the old History Channel at their best.

The footage in color is amazing and well chosen. There does seem to be more Pacific War footage than the European War. The voiceovers are excellently done and are very moving. The thematic nature of the show really works in its favor, also. I like how particular subjects are dealt with instead of the show being in strict chronological order. I think what makes the series engrossing is that there is only the footage, a Narrator (Actor Peter Coyote doing a splendid job), and the words of the people involved. There are no historians commenting that would create another layer between the viewer and the visceral nature of the program and the viewer.

There are powerful episodes such as on Medical care (which contains graphic footage) that shows the true horror of 'The Last Good War'. Also, the episodes on those that covered the war is a great tribute to intrepid reporters and cameramen. Truly unbelievable are the actual reports featured on the episodes that you can hear the crackle of gunfire in the background as the reporters speak. The Air War is excellently portrayed and the sheer awesomeness of the larger than life Naval battles that were fought in Pacific.

You will be brought to cheers and completely moved by the efforts of Men and Women of the United States to win such a truly horrific and important war.

I recommend this series highly. I think that 'The Color of War' is a excellent companion to other documentaries on the war like the legendary 'World at War'.

Definitely purchase this box set if you are a World War II or American history student. If you are not either purchase it all the same. You will not be disappointed!

A+++",1360368000,,1917,4.673590504451038
