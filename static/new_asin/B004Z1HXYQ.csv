4504303,4,B004Z1HXYQ,"An amazing singer who seems even more incredible when shown in the live format, simple raw talent presented well in this concert.",1341619200,,129,4.909090909090909
4504304,3,B004Z1HXYQ,"2 DVD, one with lots of boring songs and Jewel interpretation that's not was you are used to listen to, with her talking during music instead of signing and she sing like she took some relaxing pills. I skipped many songs.

The other dvd is better but it's short and the same songs but similar to the audio CD in performance.

My advice..
I'm not satisfied, if you like jewel buy the CD instead.",1327795200,,395,4.324324324324325
4504305,5,B004Z1HXYQ,One of the best dvds that Jewel has done!! She managed to gather all the best and most beautiful songs ever written and sung by her! Just wonderful!!,1325808000,2,149,4.357142857142857
4504306,2,B004Z1HXYQ,I expected more hits on here. I had to listen to 5 songs before I heard one that Id heard before. Maybe Im just not a big Jewel fan but I found this concert boring.,1314489600,5,164,3.7142857142857144
4504307,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"The blu-ray itself is excellent and has two concerts on it, for which it gets five stars.  In general, the concerts seem to have a folksy/bluesy/storytelling flavor with perhaps a tiny hint of country, in a unique and hard to define Jewel style, which is somewhat different than her ""pop"" like radio songs.  The second concert has eight songs accompanied by an orchestra so those songs have a classical flavor to them.

Let me give you a sampling of some of the songs from the second concert.  Jewel carefully strums her guitar on ""Foolish Games"" and ""You Were Meant For Me"".  She and the orchestra perform ""I'm Sensitive"" and ""Hands""; both are beautifully rendered with strings and air instruments and ""Hands"" is especially heavenly with the plucking of the harp.  Jewel almost seems to be scatting on ""Who Will Save Your Soul"".  She sings the aria ""Per La Gloria D'Adorarvi"".  And on ""Yodel,"" she belts out her Swiss yodeling.

Jewel only had two albums released.  So you may only know a few hit songs from the radio.  Most of the other songs may not be familiar to most people.

But be careful, and be aware that this blu-ray is actually a re-release of an earlier blu-ray.  The covers are exactly the same on both the older and the newer releases, with the same picture of Jewel.  The difference is that the older one came with an extra cardboard cover that fits over the plastic blu-ray case;  the newer one has just the plastic blu-ray case.  But again, both the newer release and the older release are exactly the same, with the same two concerts.

There is one more difference, actually for the better.  The older release has two discs, with one concert on each disc.  The newer release contains both concerts on one disc so it is more convenient.

The price is quite a bit lower on this re-release; so by all means, if you like  Jewel, get this blu-ray.",1313193600,32,1862,4.581818181818182
4504308,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"This is one of my all-time favorite concert DVDs.  Superb production (both audio and video).  IMHO, Jewel is the best singing voice since Karen Carpenter. She can do some incredible things with her voice.  Her performances are off-the-charts !!  Highly Recommended.",1430784000,,265,5.390243902439025

4504312,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"If you're a Jewel fan, this disc provides a great presentation of her live in concert. There are actually several different concert performances covered on this disc. The video and sound quality is very good and I didn't find myself even noticing any issues with the quality. The focus was clearly on Jewel and showcases her talent and ability as a performer in grand manor. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will come back to it as a concert disc favorite.",1423008000,,453,4.675

4504320,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"I've watched many a Blu-ray and this one looks better than virtually anything else I've seen. I guess since it was filmed at a higher resolution for IMAX, which makes sense, but you really need to see it to believe it. I've met Jewel backstage at one of her shows and enjoyed the concert as well, and this Blu-ray does a nice job of replicating her concerts for someone who wants to see her in the comfort of their own home. Highly, highly recommend this title to those with a Blu-ray player and HDTV.",1392336000,,501,4.340425531914893
4504321,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"I have a collection of favorite concerts and this one is one of the best.
I like Jewel but did not consider myself a huge fan until now. She
is phenomenal. The Bluray quality is fantastic as well. Also, I was
pleasantly surprised to get not one, not two, but 2.5 concerts on one
Bluray disc!  Pretty amazing. If you like Jewel, be prepared to love
her after watching these concerts. Really shows her awesome personality.
Audio recording is top notch, video is perfect. Film doesn't pan allnover
like some concert films which is annoying. Overall, great concerts filmed
in a great way.",1388188800,,584,4.669902912621359
4504322,5,B004Z1HXYQ,Jewel is an amazing singer/songwriter and these two concerts are awesome! I would highly recommend this to any Jewel fan.,1379808000,,121,5.1
4504323,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"This is really a great DVD for Jewel.  There are two full concerts and part of another one.  She sings so many of her wonderful songs.  Anyone that loves jewel, will really want this DVD.",1375315200,,187,4.285714285714286
4504324,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"Jewel: The Essential Live Songbook, is a real bargain and I recommend it to all. So don't hesitate get it now",1367366400,,109,4.238095238095238
4504325,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"In today's over-the-top spectacles that accompany hit albums (whether there is real talent involved or not) Jewel's performance might even seem sedate. But there is so much power and emotion behind her vocals that it doesn't matter. This isn't a sideshow, this isn't a carnival or lightshow, this is simply great music and great vocals presented in it's best possible way. It looks and sounds great on blu ray. And there is a lot here to enjoy, two concerts as well as  a few additional live numbers (and one music video). The interview is a bit on the short side (about 9 minutes) so it's a bit too short to be of much significance, though it's still a joy to watch. However the way it's conducted leads one to think maybe this was more a rehearsed interview as her answers seem more thought out and detailed, than they would have had it been more spontaneous. The visuals are great and Jewel is very beautiful so it's fun to watch her run through the songs, as it is easy to be captivated by her performance. The emotions of each song shines through as if this was her first time ever singing these songs, and of course there is the power of her vocals that I had mentioned before. The interplay between her and her audience is also a treat to watch. As she is first and foremost a folk artist the storytelling behind the songs is just as engaging as the songs themselves. Jim Croce was also great to listen to between songs. It was great to hear her sing some of the more well-known radio hits with a slight vocal twist, it added to the overall flavor of the original (while keeping her from getting bored with these older songs as well). Anyone who is a fan of folk/rock singing/storytelling and anyone who favors live music over lip synched spectacles owe themselves to give this a listen. Even on the songs that I am not a fan of it's so enthralling to see her put so much of herself into it. She has a great voice, and looks great on film, and this blu ray showcases all of her talents and then some. Definitely worth the price to add this in your collection.",1366934400,3,2066,4.394255874673629
4504326,4,B004Z1HXYQ,"The Blu-ray itself is very good.  Good picture quality, good sound, good menu system.  The concerts could have been better.  I tend to wander in and out of the room when it's on.",1362614400,,178,4.333333333333333

8449196,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"This is an absolute mother lode of a treat. TWO concert specials, with different set lists. The first, the Alice In Wonderland concert, starts off acoustic but is joined in by a full band around halfway into it. I wasn't too put off, but I like my Jewel with just her voice and her guitar.

The second concert delivered over an hour of that, including, finally, a professional, clear quality version of the classic but never recorded ""Violet Eyes.""

I am so over the moon that I own this, that this exists, and I feel absolutely spoiled by it as well. What a true treasure.

My only hope is this amazing, talented and funny woman will release more concert footage this way!",1464480000,2,673,4.5
8449197,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"I only recently became a Jewel fan after I read her book, 'Never Broken,' so I missed her entire career. Regardless, I enjoy listening to her music and she is in the top two of my favorite female performers.",1461110400,,207,4.333333333333333

8449200,5,B004Z1HXYQ,You absolutely must own this Blu-ray. It is the best thing ever. Jules voice sound so crystal clear on this recording. The quality is great Jewel has a beautiful voice and she is a great artist. You will love her songs. She puts her heart into every song she sings. I highly recommend this Blu-ray to anybody who is interested,1437091200,,326,4.45
8449201,5,B004Z1HXYQ,"If you've ever been lucky enough to see her live, then you know that Jewel commands a stage. Standing up there solo, only with her guitar in hands (they are small we know), she is more performer than a 5 peice band. The shows in this Blue Ray set are no different. If you have not had the chance to see her, this is the next best thing. Great clarity.",1431648000,,351,4.0285714285714285
