8163190,5,B000LPR6B0,"Vintage, pre-legend Van Dyke is at his pantomime best.  He's a million laughs, and Pat Boone's introductions are wonderful.  The quality is great, and it was fun to see Van Dyke sing, soft shoe, and give comedic homage to all of his peers and heroes; everyone from Skelton, Gleason, Carney, Bolger, and - of course - Stan Laurel.  Loads of fun, and lots of laughs.",1408838400,,364,4.569230769230769
8163191,5,B000LPR6B0,"Since purchasing the complete series of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" (highly recommended, by the way) and viewing it several times, Dick Van Dyke has become my favorite comedy star.
I heard about this DVD (Dick Van Dyke In Rare Form) and was intrigued. I knew Dick was brilliant with sitcom humor, but could he do slapstick, stand-up, and mime? The answer was a resounding, hilarious YES! I was shocked by the vast amount of material he was capable of--such versatility! His mime work was spot-on, the stand-up comedy was brilliant, and he can even sing, too! I literally watched the DVD three times in a row in one sitting, and was actually rolling on the floor(really!) gasping for breath! Dick Van Dyke is the only comic who can put me in stitches. His clean, innocent style and extreme physical abilities make for a family-friendly laugh fest.
I was impressed by how great this DVD is for such a low price. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality, as well as quantity, of the material it contained. It even has special features, including a ""Laugh-In"" segment with Dick Van Dyke as host.
This is DEFINITELY worth your time and money. Highly recommended!",1390262400,3,1191,4.758454106280193
8163192,5,B000LPR6B0,This are the early years in black and white. See how limber he was before the Dick Van Dyke show. True fans will love this video.,1271894400,2,129,4.0
8163193,3,B000LPR6B0,"I wasn't sure what to expect.  Apparently, Dick Van Dyke was a regular on the Pat Boone show before he got his own show.  He was a very talented mime.  The bits reminded me of Red Skelton, but more physical.  If you would like to see what Dick did before he married Laura, moved to the suburbs, and had Richie, this is for you.  Pat Boone hosts the collection and connects the skits.  I was never a fan of Pat Boone.",1266710400,5,416,4.074074074074074
8163194,5,B000LPR6B0,"This was a surprisingly amazing DVD. I always knew Dick Van Dyke was a comic genius, but thanks to Pat Boone - you can see that it was just in his nature to be funny, creative and incredibly nimble!
This DVD shows the origional broadcast versions of Dick's song and Dance (With Pat and Shirly Jones), skit Comedey (Laurel and Hardy) and the vinettes of story telling with only the imense limberness of Mr. Van Dyke and sound effects.
I can't believe his amazing talents. The sound and video are of the original quality of the original broadcast - but it was preserved well.
Thanks to Pat Boone who obviously released the rights and saved and organized the footage with even intros to explain what and when you are watching.
There are even bonus sketches that show rare sides of how Dick Van Dyke can alter his own comedy and make it even more funnier!
If you like Variety Shows (I.E. Carol Burnett) and watching a great performer doing what he does best - this is your DVD. For the price -it is well worth it!
I am amazed at what this Comedy Genius can do!  4-21-09",1240272000,9,1065,4.406091370558376
8163195,3,B000LPR6B0,"This is a series of sketches by Dick Van Dyke.

I am a big fan of Dick Van Dyke, the Dick Van Dyke Show, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Mary Poppins. Mr. Van Dyke has a talent for pantomime and physical comedy among many talents. The most interesting number for me was Dick Van Dyke and the lovely Shirley Jones singing a duet. There wasn't anything on this that wowed me. I have limited funds and would rather have spent my money on something else. If money is no object; then there is some nostalgia here.",1238198400,5,505,4.260416666666667
8163196,5,B000LPR6B0,"Really Good Buy. A must have DVD for fans.

If you love the comic antics of the Dick Van Dyke Show, then you'll love his earlier material that got him to stardom. Well selected acts that show the true talent of this man. 'Pet Cat' is my favorite where he acts like an old ladys cat. The old time commercials are hilarious and shamelessly plugged into his 1959 panel show 'Laugh Line'. A very unique look into that era.

Two Thumbs UP!",1176336000,15,434,4.280487804878049
