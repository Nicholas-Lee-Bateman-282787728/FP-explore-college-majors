824952,3,6304279019,I don't think my friends will ever forgive me for renting this one. The first story was just ridiculous a story about giant rats in a graveyard. The rats look like styrofoam. The second story is better about a woman who  ressurects what she thinks is her son. The third and best is the second  Zuni fetish doll story you will have some fun with this one.,963187200,5,354,4.268656716417911
824953,3,6304279019,"I watched this last night for the first time, directly after the original. I was expecting so much more, and got so little. The first story was ok, not even half as good as the opening in the original. It had some cheesy  graphics though. The second story, although it didn't make any sense and  came off to an extremely bad start, was by far the best and most  suspenseful segment. It was one of the few worthwhile parts of this movie.  The third segment, a sequel/remake of the story AMELIA from the original,  came off to a boring start, but once that little zuni doll came to life,  the fun started to roll. I was disappointed however, that the ending was a  complete reworking of the original story. That was lame and showed that the  filmmakers couldn't come up with anything original. it was fun to watch the  little doll run though. He's the funniest thing on earth! If compared to  the original, this movie is lame and stupid, but fun. If u have nothing to  compare it to, you'll like it more.",950140800,,1002,4.391304347826087
824954,5,6304279019,The first trilogy story was incredible.  It could achieve what all film directors hope to achieve- to have the audience believe the story is true.  Geraint Wyn Davies put on a spectacular performance in the roles he plays  so well.  That other lady was additionally OK.,937958400,2,269,4.782608695652174

825216,4,6304279019,"This is a DVDr from CBS - the image quality on this is good but they used a tape master - they had no film elements for the movie. There is some judder at the beginning but it improves to the point where it doesnt happen after the first few minutes. The CBS logo appears on the spine and back. There no decent film elements for this to get a blu ray release so this will be it unless a miracle happens and CBS tracks film elements

Most of you have seen this movie so I will not give information about the stories other than its one of the gorier TV movies. I personally find it very enjoyable, as a horror fan, I definitely think its a very entertaining movie that captures a "" horrific atmosphere """,1459900800,11,700,4.109489051094891

825219,2,6304279019,I'm disappointed in buying this particular DVD. I thought it was the storyline with Karen Black. This story line was used in two different storylines.  I bought the other DVD at a extremely higher price than the storyline I purchased. It never struck my mind that the title of this story line was Trilogy of Terror II until I opened the DVD packaging and started watching the movie. So Buyers beware they show the same doll on the cover of Trilogy of Terror II.but you will be sadly disappointed in the story line. The correct version is Trilogy of Terror (Special Edition) at a extremely higher price than Trilogy of Terror II. So BUYERS BEWARE!!!,1454889600,3,648,4.6347826086956525
825220,5,6304279019,"Oh joy! This wonderful horror film has FINALLY been released on DVD. I've been a big horror fan since I was a little kid and this is one of the few horror movies that truly scared the crap out of me when I saw it at about age 10 and today it still remains one of my top favorite horror films. I don't think The Graveyard Rats is all that scary except at the end with the rats but the story itself is dark and interesting. The other 2 stories...oh boy! Truly scary and fantastic! When I first saw Bobby, I remember the one thing I thought made the story really scary was the lightening from the thunderstorm lighting up the dark house briefly every few seconds especially during the close up shots of Mommy with terror on her face and fear in her eyes. The Zuni doll from He Who Kills is one of the scariest and most memorable horror movie killers I've ever come across. I'd never seen such a scary looking doll so hungry for blood and so hell bent on killing. I liked the doll way better in the second film than the first. The doll's voice is louder, more aggressive and he's way more energetic and hyper. It's like killing is his drug and he desperately needs his fix lol. I'm so glad I can finally add this to my DVD/Blu-Ray horror movie collection.",1449705600,11,1251,4.2384937238493725

825222,4,6304279019,"Having recently seen and purchased the original, I'm very upset that this sequel hasn't gotten the DVD treatment, but for now, it works This one is good as well, even though the stories are somewhat a clone with Lysette Anthony replacing Karen Black, even so, still fairly good. The package didn't include a receipt though, and Videos, though no longer being made, still can get messed up. I am glad it played well though.",1390176000,,422,4.716216216216216
825412,4,6304279019,"After all these years, and with so many other Dan Curtis productions now out on disc, it seems amazing that TRILOGY OF TERROR 2 remains a VHS-only release.  Granted it's not quite as well-executed as the original TRILOGY OF TERROR with the late Karen Black, but Lysette Anthony is given a chance to strut her stuff here by appearing in all three episodes (as Black did in the first film).  A DVD and/or Blu-ray release would make this film far more accessible to a whole new generation.",1385078400,4,486,4.574712643678161
825413,5,6304279019,Wish it would come on DVD like the original. Really enjoyed watching it like the original Trilogy of Terror movie,1367193600,2,113,4.7
825414,3,6304279019,"I remember when this debuted on USA network way back when. I liked it then, but no so much now being a bit older. I think the main problem is these are original tales from Dan Curtis and not Richard Matheson adaptations. They really lack the pacing of those stories and it shows badly with random shocks here and there, too much exposition during the action (always a bad sign) and cheesy dialogue. The original was also predictable, but was atleast exciting. Here, the opening has an outrageously cranky old basterd, but nothing else except a cheesy romance and really bad looking giant rats. The second tale was a little hard to follow but was easily the best and most suspenseful. The last, a requel of the Zuni doll tale from the 1st, gets good when the doll is loose, but disappoints as it rehashes the ending almost to a tee. Don't fix what ain't broke I suppose?",1305590400,2,869,4.506329113924051
825415,1,6304279019,THIS MOVIE YOU SHOULD HAVE ALSO MADE FOR DVD LOVERS NOT VHS ONLY,1161907200,4,64,4.0
825416,5,6304279019,"This is honestly the scariest movie I have ever seen and I am a huge horror fan.

The first story is great but its ""creepy"" and not so much scary.

The second, ""Bobby"" is the reason you should purchase. I saw this movie for the first time about 6 years ago and to this day I cannot watch ""Bobby"" alone.

The ast story is creppy but the first time you see it you will laugh.

As I said before, you NEED to see ""Bobby"".

This is my favoite horror movie and I highly reccomend it.",1143072000,11,477,3.9789473684210526
825417,5,6304279019,"This is quite frankly the best movie I've ever seen. Not scary wise, because it definately is not not NOT scary AT ALL, but it's just hilarious! My friend and I used to rent this every time we were together and fast forward through the rat story, and then just watch Bobby and the one about the Zulu Doll. ""He pushed it on top of MEEEEEEEE"" and ""YAYAYAYAYYAYA!!"" were two of the most commonly-used quotes in our friendship from the day we first saw it. If you want a good laugh, rent it and watch the last two. I own the DVD!",1120262400,,525,4.1568627450980395
825418,5,6304279019,"I don't think this movie was supposed to be a comedy, but this is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I first saw it when my friend rented it and we watched it. The first story was so funny, and the rats were so cheesy. The second story was a little bit more serious, but yet still had a comedic edge to it. What the hell were they thinking with that mask at the end? The little Indian doll brought me to my knees in laughter. The thing running around and screaming was really funny, but the girl was so stupid. She would get it trapped, and then she would go and see if it was dead. So messed up, this movie, but the best I've seen in years. Truly amazing. I give it 5 stars.",1052611200,3,683,3.9565217391304346
825419,5,6304279019,"Lysette Anthony plays three roles in three new stories.  The first story is ""The Graveyard Rats"". It runs 29 minutes.  An old, wealthy buzzard wants to destroy this man's career.  His wife insists until the wealthy old man (her husband) shows her the erotic videotape of her having sex with the other man.  So when she discovers she is still in the Last Will and Testament, she and her other lover try to kill her husband.  Will it work?  Who will have the last laugh?  Story #2 is , ""Bobby"".  It runs 26 minutes.  A thunderstorm is headed into the bay.  A woman uses chalk to draw a bewitching symbol on the floor in her house.  She casts a spell to have her dead son return to her in the living.  Later that night, as the sea churns and the thunderstorm goes wild, she hears a rap on the front door downstairs.  ""Mommy, please let me in"".  Her son has returned, shivering in the wet cold.  Will she regret the spell she has made?  Story #3 is, ""He Who Kills"".It runs 31 minutes.  This is a sequel to the original story we first saw in the first TERROR OF TRILOGY (1975), minus actress, Karen Black.  The story continues surrounding the horrid murders and the Male African Fetish Doll.",1050969600,17,1186,4.362385321100917
825420,5,6304279019,"I haven't yet seen the first one,but this one's just great! I think it was made for the USA network but I missed it,I guess. I eagerly bought this for 2 reasons:Dan Curtis and Lysette Anthony! Dan is a master at television horror,the creator of DARK SHADOWS and his tv DRACULA rocks. Lysette is the gorgeous actress who played Angelique in the DARK SHADOWS revival mini-series. Anyway,the 3 stories on here are top notch. Dan Curtis filmed BOBBY before in the TV anthology movie DEAD OF NIGHT.But that was 1977,so it was good seeing a remake using the same script and Lysette! I enjoyed this spooky movie a lot!",998870400,8,611,4.614678899082569
825421,1,6304279019,NOT WORTH IT.  THE ORIGINAL WAS MUCH BETTER.  THE THIRD SEGMENT WITH THE ZULU DOLL WAS OKAY.  THE BEST OF THE THREE.  I WOULDN'T EVEN WASTE MY TIME.  WATCH THE FIRST TRIOLOGY OF TERROR.  THE STORIES ARE BETTER DONE AND THE ZULU DOLL IS BY FAR SCARIER THAN THIS ONE.
