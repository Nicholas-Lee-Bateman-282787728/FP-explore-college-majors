7508070,5,B017MTC4UU,Peter Capaldi as the doctor has been a nice breath of fresh air this series has needed.  series 9 sees the end of the current companion and the doctor's most epic episodes yet.  I am excited to see where his adventures will go in 2017,1454284800,3,234,4.177777777777778
7508071,5,B017MTC4UU,"I like the less frenetic pace this season. I am a long time fan, and although the 'New Who' is very different from the original series, I still enjoy it. Peter is magnificent, but Clara can't leave soon enough for me.",1453939200,2,217,4.317073170731708
7508072,5,B017MTC4UU,"Incredible experimental season of an extraordinarily brilliant show... Capaldi is mesmerizing in the title role. Several of the episodes are masterpieces - even the poorest is a bold and admirable experiment (Sleep No More).  And the penultimate episode, Heaven Sent is one of the greatest hours of television ever made... Unique, poetic, smart, puzzling, funny, creepy and so rewarding by the pay-off.

Simply the best series of the last 9, and that's saying something. Thank you BBC and DW! Thank God everyone is back for season 10!",1449964800,17,534,5.126436781609195
7508073,5,B017MTC4UU,"The sonic screwdriver is BAAAACK! But not until almost the last scene of the series.

As with Part 1, Part 2 gives us mostly longer story arcs, told over more than one episode. There is also some carryforward in the story-lines from Part 1, which is all to the good.

English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes and on the one Bonus Extra included on the Part 2 DVD/BluRay sets, ""Doctor Who Extras (Behind the Scenes)"".

[Edited to add] A Complete Series 9 is now available on amazon to preorder on DVD or BluRay. Issue date is April 5, 2016. Its bonus features include three commentary tracks.

....Episodes 7 & 8, ""The Zygon Invasion"" and ""The Zygon Inversion"". An emergency recording has two Osgoods  no telling which is human and which is shape-shifting Zygon and no first name. She explains the peace treaty the Doctor brokered, named Operation Double, ""a covert operation outside normal UNIT structures to resettle and rehouse an alien race in secrecy on planet Earth. With UNIT's help, 20,000,000 Zygons have been allowed to take human form, been dispersed around the world, and are now living amongst us. We are making this [video] in case something goes wrong.""
When does it not go wrong? A young Zygon named Bonnie wants to liberate the Zygons to their true forms. Whether they want to be liberated or not. How do you know who to trust when a Zygon can take any person's form?
Insight into a school teacher! Clara admits ""I used to memorize Trivial Pursuit questions so I could win.""
Trivia: The first appearance of the Zygons was with the Fourth Doctor in 1975. Not a top-of-the-line story, I thought. I appreciate this new story more, though I don't see where the lightning-from-the-hands came from or the ability to read minds and take on the form of someone in the memories of someone not even touched - that is stretching:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Story-80-Terror-of-the-Zygons/dp/B00C6ACUF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who, Story 80: Terror of the Zygons</a>

....Episode 9 ""Sleep No More"". In the 38th century, a Neptune rescue mission has been sent to the Le Verrier Space Station, orbiting Triton.  Neptune base hasn't heard from the station for days. Commander Nagata leads her rescue team through the eerily empty space station corridors only to meet  the Doctor and Clara, arguing, as usual. Before proper introductions can be made they are chased by creatures made of sand. No, not quite, as the Doctor discovers after analyzing left-behind sand. They're made of ""blood cells, skin cells, mucus."" That's right, they are the grit in the corner of your eyes when you wake.
""It's adaptable. It's clever. And it's coming for us.""

....Episode 10 ""Face the Raven"" A worried Rigsy calls Clara. He has a new tattoo on his neck. Except it isn't really a tattoo, ""It's a number and it's counting down to zero."" The best way to figure out where he got the chrono-lock is to visit the strange alley he stumbled upon the day before. It couldn't be a trap, could it?
Clara: ""You're going to save me. You're the Doctor. That's what you do.""
Trivia: Rigsy first met Clara and the Doctor in ""Flatline"", a favorite episode of mine from Series 8. Great tension and effects:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Season-8/dp/B00IT3KQMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: Season 8</a>

....Episodes 11 & 12 ""Heaven Sent"" and ""Hell Bent"".  The Doctor has been transported to a very strange castle, surrounded by water. No way out. And he's stalked by The Veil. It doesn't talk. It doesn't communicate. It just kills if you can't tell it a secret. Doctor, half to himself, ""Is it a trap. Or is it a torture chamber?"" It may take him four billion years to find out.
As Steven Moffat says in the TV 910 Closer Look: ""This is the story where it goes wronger than ever before.""

....BONUS EXTRA ""Doctor Who Extras: Behind the Scenes"" (37 minutes total)
These featurettes are different from the snippets shown free on TV right after the episodes aired. Good thing, they have lots of spoilers.
Rufus Hound narrates. Commentators include ""Steven Moffat (lead writer), Jenna Coleman (plays Clara), Peter Capaldi (plays Doctor), Ingrid Oliver (plays Osgood the Doctor's Biggest Fan), Tom Wilton (plays a Zygon), Mark Gatiss (writer), Reece Shearsmith (plays Gagnan Rassmusen), Mark McQuoid (camera operator), Joivan Wade (plays Rigsy), Maisie Williams (plays Ashildr/Mayor Me) and Rachel Talalay (director).
I particularly liked the explanations of how the writers/directors took on a couple experiments this season.
In ""Sleep No More"", Rufus Hound says, ""Mark [Gatiss] was also keen to tell this story in a style new to Who."" The cameraman had to act while filming scenes, because the video was supposed to come from the helmet cam of a soldier.
Moffat notes, of ""Heaven Sent"", ""This is unlike anything I've ever written before, 'cause there really is pretty much only one speaking part.""
Talalog smiles as she says of the stress of co-ordinating this episode: ""I think on a scale of one to 10, it was sort of a 25.""

I so enjoy this show that it is hard to imagine not watching or not buying it. Though Part 2 has the usual memorable one-liners, the last episode seemed just bit contrived. But if Clara can come in Impossibly, she can leave Impossibly.

""I've finally run out of corridor. There's a life summed up.""

Happy Reader",1449532800,13,5620,5.187637969094923
7508074,5,B017MTC4UU,"Yes!!! I'm glad they switched the old cover with this one. Can't wait for the season finale, & so far this has been the best season of Peter Capaldi & Steven Moffat yet. I already own Series 9 Part 1 & love it. If you are a true fan, you will appreciate this season most of all. The acting is 100%, the plots/story lines are intelligent & makes you think without too much confusion (if you understand the show). Clara's last season (for now), as I'm sure she'll be back in one way or another for an anniversary episode or something special. I wish this wasn't gonna take until late January to be released, as the show it self ends in 2 more days on December 5th. It would've been wise to make this available before Christmas, but who knows ayy??? I recommend this series & this show & all of its incarnations.

This is a review of the DVD set itself, not a comment on the episodes or the series. At least on this initial release, disc 2 has shows in a degraded format with Horizontal scan lines constantly distracting the viewer from the episodes themselves. Episodes affected are ''Heaven Sent'' and ''Hell Bent''. These horizontal scan lines give the episodes a 240p visual quality, like watching a low quality VHS recording from thirty years ago or more, without the random noise.

The four episodes on disc 1 look fine despite being more compressed to fit all four episodes onto one disc.

DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET until BBC Worldwide corrects the issues...!

While this collection does have one relatively weak episode in ""Sleep No More,"" which was an interesting concept which fell just short of being successfully realized, it is more than offset by the superlative ""Heaven Sent,"" which sees both the writing talents of Steven Moffat and the mad acting skills of Peter Capaldi at the top of their form.

7508139,4,B017MTC4UU,"If you're a fairly dedicated Dr. Who fan, by the time you've reached Series Nine, you're used to putting up with at least one or two inferior episodes because the others are mostly good to excellent. Series Nine - Part Two is no different, in that respect, so IMHO it's worth buying for the sake of closure it provides and the rousing end of this phase of the Doctor's current regeneration. The ""Zygon Invasion"" and ""Zygon Inversion"" episodes were mostly satisfying, even though both plot lines seriously tested both my attention span and my ability to suspend disbelief. There were some plot- and character-associated loose ends tied up by the end of the second Zygon-infested episode, which is a good thing. ""Sleep No More"" was an out-of-place dud that would have benefited from an extensive rewrite of the plot (preferably by Steven Moffat). However, the interesting mix of actors chosen to play the ""expendable"" characters served to rescue (somewhat) what was otherwise an unlovable episode. ""Face the Raven"" was excellent, especially since it served admirably as a bridge to the subsequent episodes and set the stage for the end of this cycle of the Doctor's story. My only objection was to the excessively drawn-out and very emotional ending. Yes, it's a bit of a tear jerker (and that's okay), but the interplay between Clara and the Doctor (and other characters present during the final scene) played on my emotions a bit longer than necessary, ALMOST spoiling the emotional impact of the final scene. ""Heaven Sent"" will REALLY tax your attention span and patience because it takes so LONG to arrive at the resolution of its plot. However, do NOT fast-forward through any part of this episode because all the finicky details and plot twists are important to your understanding of the action and plot resolution of the ""Hell Bent"" episode, which is really satisfying and an ample reward for your patience with the seeming pointlessness of the previous episode. So Part 2 is 90-percent great because, at the final scene of the final episode, you're left with the very strong impression that Series 10 promises to be as good as (if not better than) what's gone before!",1455148800,6,2173,4.923705722070845
7508140,5,B017MTC4UU,Peter Capaldi makes a great Doctor! The last half of season 9 has some awesome episodes that really shows the power of the Scotsman as an actor. Bonus points for being an old mate of Craig Ferguson (they were in a punk rock band together during the 80s!),1455062400,,254,4.3125
7508141,2,B017MTC4UU,"Like all stories in this era, the acting is wonderful, the scripts... not so much. There are some good moments, though.
