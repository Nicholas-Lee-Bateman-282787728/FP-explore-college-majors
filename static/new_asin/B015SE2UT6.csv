8734526,5,B015SE2UT6,"A view of How John Ford shows us what post world war one Navy Submarines were like.
A Young John Wayne toward the end of the movie is on the surface talking through a radio set
trying to get messages to a crippled submarine whose only hope is to get the divers down to
unblock a torpedo tube so sailors can be shot out to the surface before chlorine gas kills them.
It is EARLY sound mostly silent, before Marion Morrison became John Wayne. Glad they took
the time at Fox to save this film from oblivion. Lets buy it and maybe Fox will give us some more
If we don't buy DVDs and they don't get money, we will lose more movies. Buy and Save film!",1484179200,3,645,4.086614173228346

8734528,5,B015SE2UT6,"This film is such a rare gem. John Fords 1930 talking picture which was also arranged for silent veiwing.  The print on this DVD is the ONLY remaining print of the film and is a working print for the International Sound Version .  Being a working print it only has marginal sound and is filled in with intertitles.  So much of the film is""silent"" .
Still it is a great example of Fords excellent early work. The details as to life on a sub in the Navy inbetween the world wars is pretty accurate.  The special effects (models, fog ,etc) are impressive for the time.
I HIGHLY recommend this to film buffs and cinephiles or if your a rabid John Ford fan as we all should be !!
Let's hope that someday this print finds its way into the hands of a company like Cinetech for restoration.",1472774400,5,782,4.299319727891157
