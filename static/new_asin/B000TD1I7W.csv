8208613,5,B000TD1I7W,"This is an excellent, and inspiring, instructional DVD. Even the first, beginning level song, Groundhog, is wonderful, haunting and ancient sounding. Can't say enough.  This is not a beginner level DVD but may spur your playing on. Thank you, Jim Mills.",1481068800,,253,5.170731707317073
8208614,5,B000TD1I7W,This music and DVD is very well done.  Jim does an excellent job of explaining the different styles of picking and rolls he is using.  By far the best learning tool for banjo I have purchased.  This is for intermediate to advanced players.,1296172800,6,239,4.511627906976744
