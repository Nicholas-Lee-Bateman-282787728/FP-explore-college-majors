2126382,5,B0002VETFO,"I was thrilled to see that this fun sit-com is now available on DVD.  This is the complete second season and it was fun to re-visit the older episodes.  This set includes all 25 episodes as well as blooper and deleted scenes.

I highly recommend this set and suggest that you pick up season one as well.",1105488000,10,303,4.280701754385965
2126383,5,B0002VETFO,"I never had any interest in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" until about two years ago, when I caught a couple of episodes in syndication. I laughed so much, I started taping old episodes and making sure to watch the new episodes on Monday nights. This is perhaps the funniest live action comedy series since the mid 80's heyday of ""Cheers"" (sorry, ""Seinfeld""), though I would still rank the glory years of ""The Simpsons"" circa 1992-97 as the greatest period of TV comedy ever.

What I like about ""Raymond"" the most is the cast. I still don't know if Ray Romano is a good stand up comedian, but he is effective as Ray Barone, a sportswriter for a New York newspaper, and husband to Debra (the very cute and perky Patricia Heaton)and father to three kids. Complementing the cast are Brad Garrett as Ray's older brother Robert, and the terrific Peter Boyle and Doris Roberts as Ray's parents, Frank and Marie. Season two, like most series, is when the character development really began to take place. There are some terrific episodes, particularly the ""All I want for Christmas"" show, when Debra finds herself unable to control her lust for Ray on Christmas Day.

If you had only enough money to buy one of ""Raymond""'s first two seasons on DVD, go with the second season. It has 25 episodes, compared with Season One's 22, and the extras include some very funny bloopers and deleted scenes. I wish I had gotten hooked on ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" sooner, but better late than never.",1104624000,13,1474,4.709302325581396
2126384,5,B0002VETFO,"When individuals rate or review movies, books, dvds, music cds,

etc. the tendency is to be a little biased based on who or what

is involved in that particular stream of entertainment media.

Of course, not all the time, I myself have come across some

huge disappointments.  However, I will say it just like so many

other reviewers would say it about their particular character,

 song, or movie, ""this is a must for any and all fans of the show

Everybody Loves Raymond!""  If you enjoy decent comedy writing,

excellent character portrayal by the actors and actresses and

possibly even being able to relate to some of the incidents and

family dysfunction the Barones' seem to encounter then this dvd

is for you.  I have seen these episodes over and over through

sydication and I don't tire from watching them.  So having the

opportunity to own them on dvd to view for years to come is a

great feeling.  This show just improves as time goes on.  Season

one is good, season two is better, three will be better than two

and so on.  You get the idea.  Don't hesitate, it's worth the $$

as opposed to trying to tape it with all those commercials.

Funny stuff.  I highly recommend.",1104105600,8,1189,4.533333333333333
2126385,5,B0002VETFO,"I seen all the seasons of Everybody Loves Raymond, it was an amazing show.  When I looked at Ray, he reminds me of Eugene Levy's character Jim's Dad in American Pie to his kids.  I can definitely relate to Ray Romano and Ray Barone, he lived with his parents when he was 29 and I lived with my parents when I was 24 when I was in college. When Ray started Everybody Loves Raymond, nobody believe a show can go up to nine seasons.  The ratings were so high, it would gone up to ten or eleven seasons like Frasier or Cheers.  This show is compared to the King of Queens, Ray is like Doug Heffernan and Debra is like Carrie Heffernan.  Their are few people I admired in the show was Ray and Marie.  Ray is a nice guy, he's kind of the guy girls bring home to mom.  Ray Romano is a great actor, he looks like a MTV VJ Carson Daly and Freddie Prinze Jr.  Sarah Michelle Gellar can mistake him for his husband. Ray Romano reminds me of MTV VJ Carson Daly, Freddie Prinze Jr and The King of Queens Kevin James.  Marie is like the perfect mom and grandmother, even though she meddling in their kids life, but she meddles in their life out of love and she always understanding and always cool what happened to their kids and she always make her kids feel right at home.  Doris Roberts is a perfect mom and grandmother off the set in Everybody Loves Raymond. Doris Roberts is a wonderful actress, she should of won the oscar long time ago. She reminds me of Florence Henderson in the Brady Bunch and Marion Ross from Happy Days. Patrica Heaton was an excellent actress when she plays Ray's wife, she looks like his daughter then his wife. Patricia should have been in the 50 Most Beautiful People in People weekly.  Patricia Heaton looks like she was 19 or 20.  She has greatest resemblance of Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt and The OC's Rachel Blison.  Brad Garrett when he plays Robert, his character reminds me of Bruce Willis character John McClane in Die Hard movies.  Brad Garrett ever played John McClane in Die Hard he could have done it better than ever then Bruce Willis did.  Monica Horan played Amy she is a great actress, she should have been nominated for an Emmy for the rest of the cast.  Monica Horan has the greatest resemblance of Buffy the Vampire Slayer star Sarah Michelle Gellar.  If she ever played Buffy Summers in Buffy the Vampire Slayer she would played the character better than ever Sarah Michelle Gellar would.  Anybody can mistake her for Sarah Michelle Gellar and so could Sarah's husband Freddie Prinze Jr. Monica Horan should have been in the 50 Most Beautiful People in People weekly.  The show had a great nine years, I can't believe it would have gone that far before.  The whole cast did amazing job for making the show gone longer season than any other show I saw.  Everybody Loves Raymond is not a show, it's like a vacation that you never want to leave.",1103155200,,2883,4.4120982986767485

It's becoming rare to have such funny and entertaining shows like ""Raymond"" grace American television.

2126691,5,B0002VETFO,"I had seen most of these shows long ago and it was still great fun to see again.  It was so good to see a show which didn't rely on sex or body functions to be funny.  If you like sports, there is an episode for you.  Have siblings or kids - same thing.  I especially liked the episode about the meatballs.  The daughter-in-law wanted the recipe.  My mother-in-law gave her recipe to her daughter and to me but complained that neither of us could make them as good as hers.  After she passed away, we happened to compare our recipes and - yup - we had different recipes.  Which was the original - who knows.  Anyway, this show is fun to see and watch the family dynamics.",1402444800,,671,4.1796875

2126717,4,B0002VETFO,Everyone has a family member like every character in this series. There is so much love in this family. They just have a hard time saying it. I guess that's why I find the dysfunction so funny. I can see myself or one of my family members in most of the episodes. It's not that I thing dysfunction is funny but there is stress relief at being able to laugh about it once in a while. Some of the episodes hit the nail on the head and some are not so funny. Frank is a hoot most of the time.,1392076800,,489,3.9

2126742,3,B0002VETFO,"I love the show, however, this dvd does not go from one episode to another by itself. You actually have to press the play button twice, in-between every episode. I like to watch these shows while I'm busy cooking or cleaning and it's very annoying to have to stop to press play, not once, but twice to get it to keep playing. All of the other DVD's out there, including seasons 3 and 4 of this same show, just keep playing the next episodes on their own. The content, I would give five stars.",1376524800,2,492,4.24468085106383

Marie as the know it all busy body mother in-law is outrageous; Debra and Ray's relationship is really so real, to include whether or not they're going to have sex or the very basic way that eat or even sit in the bed together; their arguments and relationships. While I don't now anyone like Robert, he is clear and away essential to the show. Frank on the other hand-eechh.

I have three so far and anytime you've had a hard day, just sit back and turn the DVD on and you'll feel happy and relaxed in no time. The humor is wonderful and the cast of characters are perfectly cast.

The cast really gells this season and you can believe that the characters are a family.  Robert becomes more and more relevant, but still is underutilized.  Doris Roberts and Peter Boyle are hilarious.  Great season well worth a 5 star rating.",1183852800,,390,5.03125
2126896,5,B0002VETFO,"Season 2 isn't my favorite ELR season, but it is very solid and enjoyable all the way through.  It includes the two-part flashback showing Raymond and Debra's engagement and wedding and many excellent episodes, my favorites being ""Golf,"" ""Anniversary,"" ""Marie's Meatballs"" (with the infamous sabotage of the basil!), ""The Checkbook"" (with the hilarious ATM scene), ""The Ride-Along,"" ""Family Bed,"" ""Good Girls,"" and ""T-Ball.""  This season is definitely one of the best from one of the best sitcoms ever.

Disc 1:
""Ray's on TV""--Ray is invited on the Roy Firestone Show and his family is critical of how he pronounces words and scratches his microphone.
""Father Knows Least""--Ally is being a brat so Debra and Raymond go to a parenting class where they learn about active listening skills that Ray seems to master better than Debra.
""Brother""--Robert is depressed on the second anniversary of his divorce so he starts to get more attached to Raymond.  Highlight: when Ray reenacts a movie scene and says ""Hey mother...""
""Mozart""--Ally doesn't want to take piano lessons from her grandma, so Raymond tries to relearn the ""Theme from Love Story"" to encourage her to pursue music.
""Golf""--Raymond tricks Debra into letting him play golf and then has an anxiety attack due to the guilt.  The advice from his doctor is more golf to relieve his stress (Ray: ""Would I see a podiatrist or a proctologist to get a foot removed from my a**""). I like when Debra goes off, ""When do I get to have an episode!?""

Disc 2:
""Anniversary""--It's Frank and Marie's 40th anniversary and they make a startling comment about their marriage to Raymond.  I like the kid they chose to play a 10-year-old Robert in the flashback.  His mannerisms were perfect, he was even left-handed.
""Working Late Again""--Thanks to Ray's mother, Debra begins to think Raymond stays at work late to avoid being at home so she gets him to work at home and soon regrets that decision.  Pat O'Brien makes a guest appearance.
""The Children's Book""--Debra wants to write a children's book and Ray thinks he's helping by writing it himself.
""The Gift""--It's Frank's 65th birthday and Ray didn't think they were going to buy him presents.  He then has to think of something to compete with Robert's remote boat and decides on a tropical aquarium.  An emotional episode at the end.
""High School""--Raymond goes to his 20th high school reunion and Debra has a better time with his old classmates than he does.

Disc 3:
""The Letter""--After her Tupperware party is ruined by a certain meddling mother-in-law, Debra decides to write Marie a letter about how she makes her feel.  Raymond, of course, is against the idea.
""What I  Want For Christmas""--For Christmas, Raymond wants to get Debra in the mood for what he wants all year round.
""Civil War""--Ray hopes to bond with his father in a Civil War reenactment but, as a late enlistment, he's signed up with the other side.  Why Raymond getting out of a planned baby shower didn't cause a ""house divided against itself"" with Debra remains a mystery.
""Mia Famiglia""--For Ally's school project, Raymond tracks down his oldest living relative who visits them from Italy and thinks he's finally found a relative to be proud of.  While she brings the family together, she may not really be family.
""Marie's Meatballs""--Ray asks his mom to teach Debra how to make her meatballs and she sabotages the cooking lesson.  Debra goes off in this one, ""Who's the nutcase now!!!""

Disc 4:
""The Checkbook""--Debra complains about how difficult it is to do the finances and Raymond doesn't believe it so she makes him take over the bills and, whala,  their checks turn to rubber.  Unrealistic but very funny, especially the ATM scene.
""Ride-Along""--Robert doesn't think his wise-cracking brother appreciates what he does for a living so he has him accompany him and his partner Judy (she's funny) on patrol.  When Raymond sees a heroic act, he writes an article about his brother but the editors make it about Raymond.
""Family Bed""--Ray and Debra try to wean their daughter from having to sleep in their bed.  Of course, for Ray, this process involves his mother.
""Good Girls""--The truth is out that Marie likes Amy better than Debra because she has been a ""good girl"" before marriage.  We learn something funny about Robert's birth.
""T-Ball""--Deb and Ray take their kids to a T-ball game and Debra is criticized by the wimpy coach about the snacks she brought.  Not liking conflict, Ray initially does not stick up for his wife and tries to buy snacks on the sly.

Disc 5:
""Traffic School""--Robert's traffic school classes are dull so he introduces Traffic Cop Timmy which he uses to get out his frustrations on his family.  A little creepy.
""Six Feet Under""--Raymond finds out that he's shrunk to under six feet and begins worrying about getting old and not accomplishing his goals.
""The Garage Sale""--Raymond has a problem selling his kids' crib and baby clothes at a garage sale because he wants more children.
""The Wedding Part 1 & 2""--The best of the end of season flashback episodes.  This two-parter goes back ten years to when Ray first gets his columnist job and proposes to Debra.  Debra is so excited about the wedding, he wonders if that is the only reason she agreed to marry him.  At the wedding, Ray's behavior makes Debra wonder if he's ""freaking out"" or is drunk.  I like how there are no clichs in the wedding scene like the best man losing the rings or the organ playing the wedding march too long.  Ray's vows: ""I'm sorry I've been such a jerk.  I promise not to be one anymore, if you'll help me.""",1182643200,3,5595,4.820083682008368

2126918,5,B0002VETFO,"The second season of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND is so much fun!  While the first season established the character development of the ""main players"" on the program (Raymond and his brood), the following season brought the various personalities together to clash over dualing Italian food recipes, Tupperware parties and everyday conflicts.  Ray Romano (as Ray Barone) has a real flair for physical comedy, and all of the players bring their talents to the episodes, as well.  Doris Roberts (as his mother, Marie) has the disapproving double take down to a science, Peter Boyle (as his father, Frank) made his catchphrase ""Holy crap!"" one of the hallmarks of the program, along with unbuckling his belt and unzipping his pants, whenever he finds himself in Ray's living room, to watch Sports Center, Patricia Heaton (as his wife, Deborah) made ""idiot"" a popular retort whenever she had to deal with Ray's thoughtless antics, Brad Garrett (as his brother, Robert) makes neurotic look fashionable, and the slew of guest characters seamlessly work their magic in the plot twists, as well.  I don't want to ruin the episodes for you, so, I won't describe them.  I will tell you that this show gives most shows on television today, a run for their money.

2126920,5,B0002VETFO,"I'm really glad for the release of these DVD box sets, because without them, I never would have gotten into this show...now one of my very favorites!

The plot centers upon Ray Barone, a sportswriter living on Long Island with his wife Debra and children Ally, Geoffrey and Michael. The bane of their existence is Ray's parents Marie and Frank...living just across the street, and acting like Ray and Debra's home is an extension of their own. To compound the problem, Ray's older brother Robert, a divorced NYPD lieutenant, moves back home...

This show doesn't look for sophisticated, implausible storylines. Rather, it focuses upon the tiny aspects of everyday life and relationships - father/son, husband/wife, brother/brother, parent/child - and finds comedy in the truth. Ray and Debra often clash, as he just wants to relax when he comes home from work, and she - a stay-at-home mom - wants him to pitch in, or go out. Frank is crass, and Marie is nosy and opinionated.

Season 2 includes flashbacks of Ray and Debra's wedding; various parenting disasters involving the three toddlers; Ray going on a ride-along with Robert; and cooking rivalry between Debra and Marie.

If you're unfamiliar with this show, check it out! You'll soon be laughing hysterically and looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164931200,3,1306,5.0046082949308754

It's a great choice if you want to choose just a few and not buy all the seasons.  But Season one is a must if you haven't seen it.",1163548800,,263,4.22
2126922,5,B0002VETFO,"As with any successful television series with as many seasons as Everybody Loves Raymond, it is always fun to revisit episodes like these. The characters are still not quite as heavily developed as they were around Season 3 (and it really wasn't until Season 4 until they truly took off), but it is still a nice step up from Season 1 and contains some fresh, funny episodes that all fans will love.

These earliest seasons of ELR focus a lot more on Ray and Debra and their young family. The kids probably appear in this season a lot more than they do later on, and it's fun to see how Ray and Debra battled with juggling three such little kids. They were also considerably nicer to each other back in these days, and episodes like ""Marie's Meatballs"" and ""The Letter"" are hilarious because at this point, Debra still has not quite grasped how manipulative and crazy her overbearing mother-in-law can be. Believe it or not, there actually was a point in the series where Debra truly believed that the concept of a successful, mature conversation with Marie really existed! Look no further than Season 2--it is just hysterical.

As much as I adore this show, I think they got slightly, slightly over the top in the last two seasons, with Debra throwing a hissy fit about absolutely everything, Marie being way over the line, etc... On the whole, they kept the series classy and fun right up to the end, but like I said it is still nice to go back to the lighter episodes that make up the first couple of seasons.",1144454400,17,1511,4.531135531135531
2126923,5,B0002VETFO,"In its second season the show was moved to its familiar 9:30/8:30 central timeslot and focused mainly on fleshing out the characters more thoroughly. The early rivalry between Debra and Marie can be seen in the episodes ""Marie's Meatballs"" and ""The Letter"", while Ray and Robert get on each others nerves in ""Brother"" and ""The Ride Along"". Writer Tucker Cawley (who eventually won a writing Emmy for the season seven episode, ""Baggage"") writes two of the season's worst episodes. Cawley was always a natural storyteller more so than a comedian and it took him a few seasons before he was able to integrate quality jokes into his plot driven scripts, which he does successfully in ""Good Girls"". The season opener has jokes that only an English professor could appreciate while ""Civil War"" is your typical ""son looking for acceptance from his father"" story.

""T-Ball"" is an underrated episode and Traffic Cop Timmy makes a memorable appearance in ""Traffic School"", painting Robert as a sympathetic figure. A funny season, but not as consistently funny as seasons 3-5.",1143072000,9,1065,5.051136363636363

2126939,5,B0002VETFO,"First telecast in the Fall of 1996, Everybody Loves Raymond became an instant favorite among TV audiences, a love affair that would last for nine memorable seasons. Following on the heels of a series of successful sitcoms starring stand-up comics - Seinfeld, Home Improvement, The Drew Carey Show, etc., Everybody Loves Raymond drew upon the comedic talents of Ray Romano who plays the role of the title character Ray Barone...

A successful Long Island-based sportswriter, Ray and his wife Debra (Patricia Heaton) enjoy a happy marriage and the company of their three children - daughter Ally (Madylin Sweeten) and twin sons Geoffrey (Sawyer Sweeten) and Michael (Sullivan Sweeten). But they also happen to live directly across the street from Ray's parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts), who take it upon themselves to enter their son and daughter-in-law's house whenever they wish (without knocking) and dispense advice and sometimes insults. Joining Frank and Marie is Ray's brother Robert (Brad Garrett), a divorced policeman, who periodically lives with Frank and Marie and is often jealous of Ray's idyllic life. Together, they create the perfect loving and dysfunctional family...

The Everybody Loves Raymond (Season 2) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere in which Ray appears on a television sports talk show only to turn in a less than flattering appearance. When his family reveals the truth about his awkwardness, Ray is determined to perform better on TV, but his second stint is worse than his first... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""Brother"" in which Ray attempts to bond with Robert on the anniversary of his divorce, and ""The Children's Book"" in which Debra's noble attempt to write a children's book is turned into a one-on-one writing competition by Ray... Season 2 also features guest appearances by sports figures Roy Firestone, James Worthy, and Pat O'Brien...

2126940,4,B0002VETFO,"I always enjoyed ""ELR"".  Over the course of 8 or so seasons they produced some VERY funny stuff.

Season Two, while enjoyable, hits several grounders and a triple now and again, but no real home runs.  Maybe I'm making an unfair comparison -- I started watching the Season 2 DVD set just after finishing the Season 4 DVD set of ""Frasier"", and that is a hard act to follow.

I know that subsequent season sets of ""ELR"" will be worth watching and buying.  Each season is peppered with some truly great stuff now and there.  But Season 2 probably won't rank as one of the best.  Still good, though.  Better than most sitcoms by a country mile!!",1113436800,,641,4.418803418803419
2126941,5,B0002VETFO,"As a married 30-something with 3 kids, this show rings so true and it just cracks me up.  The cast is great, and work so well together.  I just LOVE this show and am thrilled it is on DVD so I can enjoy it over and over again.

I only wish they had a PLAY ALL option.",1110499200,6,267,3.6491228070175437
2126942,4,B0002VETFO,"There seems to be a love-hate sentiment toward ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" at this website.  In response to Zeek, I think you are pathetic.  It's okay to say you hate this show and bash it, but don't give false information about the episodes.  When you falsify the synopsis of the episodes and even inserted sick references, you went too far.  Get a life buddy!

Now back to the show.  It's not that bad.  It's supposed to be silly and even a bit stupid.  This is comedy, and everyone has there own preferences, some like dark comedy, while others like slap-stick kinds.  I'm going to say that ""ELR"" is more geared toward an older audience, those whose are around 25-50 years-old.  Of course that is a generalization.  But I can see how young teens aren't going to like it.  For those people, continue watching whatever you watch.

Probably the only reason why anyone would want to buy the DVDs is to get the bloopers and deleted scenes!  But aside from that, I still think that the price for the whole set is a little expensive.  My favorite episodes for this season is Mozart, Good Girls, Mia Famiglia, and the Ride Along.  I think they are the most unique and funniest ones of the season.  As said in the first season, I'm very impressed with Brad Garrett's acting.  His Italian is surprisingly good in Mia Familiglia, maybe even better than Ray.  Also, I like how Ray play the piano in Mozart, it was not professional-looking, but it was very authentic and it didn't feel like acting.

This show might not be appropriate for young children.  There are references to sex and some mild languages.  I think this is a good season, better than average.",1110153600,4,1649,4.594501718213058
2126943,5,B0002VETFO,"I read, with mild amusement, Zeek's review of what he called one of the worst series ever made. I'd like to know what Zeek would do differently. The show's success comes from what's really an honest portrayal of a lot more families than some of us would like to admit. Much like Bill Cosby's humor, the Barone family's situations are more just plain reality in so many families than anything else, and therein lies the true humor of this show. Doris Roberts has got to be one of the greatest cast members of this or any ensemble cast...anyone who doesn't see that is just not paying attention here. I didn't start watching the series until it went into daily syndication...then I couldn't get enough of it...it's the perfect successor to Seunfeld and I'm glad these shows are making their way to DVD, like Seinfeld. I watched one of the early Seinfeld shows and realized what I loved about it the first time...Raymond is the same way. Everybody who DOESN'T love Raymond...just doesn't get Raymond.

Here in the UK, unlike brilliant shows we import from the US like; Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Will and Grace, Frasier, Sex and the City....this comedy is really average.

Maybe its Ray Romano, who gets paid a ridiculous sum each episode. Face it he's not funny! His delivery is like Droopy on downers, yes that dull.  Even here someone said in a review that the other characters were funnier.

This comedy is one step from the Cosby Show, and that is not a complement, trust me. The gags are lined up with big red flags before they arrive for the audience to laugh at. Very 1970s.

2126946,5,B0002VETFO,"I am a VERY late comer to Everybody Loves Raymond.  I had seen it a few times but didn't become a regular viewer until season 8.  Thank God for re-runs and DVD sets that are now allowing me to catch up on everything I missed.  Oddly enough, I decided to start with season Two as the first I purchased on DVD.  The reason being that the first seasons of most sitcoms are usually so very rough and the show and cast usually aren't quite developed yet.  I wanted to watch the show when the characters were going to be more like what I know from coming in late to the game.

I was not disapointed and I am sure I will pick up season one afterall.  Season two really had all of the elements that I love show much about the show and the characters just look a little younger.  And of course there is frequent appearances by Kevin James before he would get his own sitcom, ""The King of Queens"".

I really enjoyed the set from the get-go...25 glorious episodes in all. I won't summarize all 25, but here are a few of my favorites from season two:

""Anniversary"" - At a big surprise party for Frank and Marie's 40th wedding anniversary, Raymond is shocked to learn that his parents were once separated for a year and might have gotten divorced if Frank hadn't returned home to help with Ray's broken arm. After the initial shock wears off, Ray starts to wonder if it's his fault that his parents are together and miserable.

""The Letter"" - When Marie  ruins her Tupperware party, Debra decides that she's had just about enough of her mother-in-law's constant interference. She  writes a letter to her Marie, telling her to stop intruding into her life. Horrified by the problems that this letter might trigger, Ray does everything in his power to intercept the offending document.

""All I Want for Christmas"" - All Ray wants for Christmas is a little loving from his wife and he's willing to try anything and everything to have his holiday wish come true. When Ray finally has seduced Debra, his entire family is working their way into the house for Eggs Florentine and exchanging gifts.

""The Checkbook"" - When Raymond takes over the family checkbook to prove to Debra how ""easy it can be"" to balance it, he discovers he is no accountant. After he quickly runs out of money and starts bouncing checks, he tries to hide the truth from Debra and winds up entangled in a mess of lies, two fake checkbooks and a large loan from his brother.

""Traffic School"" - Robert proves to be a crashing bore when it comes to teaching traffic school, so he decides to practice his presentation on the family-which drives them crazy. In an attempt to lighten things up, he puts in an assist-officer call to ""Traffic Cop Timmy,"" a puppet dressed as a policeman.

""The Wedding Parts 1 & 2"" - These two episodes show how Ray proposed to Debra and their eventual wedding.

As far as extras, they could be better.  There's only commentary on a couple of episodes to go along with some bloopers and deleted scenes.  Nothing to write home about and hopefully future seasons will be better equipped.

This is just plain funny.  Intelligent without being snobbish like Frasier and wacky without being too low brow.  These are characters that probably most of us know in our own lives.  Boy do I KNOW some Maries!!!

8033143,5,B0002VETFO,"It takes a special team--behind and in front of the cameras--to make a series that stays consistently good for nine seasons. In this, 'Everybody Loves Raymond' succeeds mightily. Even if you're on a budget (or in my case, eternal financial punishment) it's possible to build your series economically with previously-viewed dvd's, and checking out the reviews of Amazon's many sellers. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",1517961600,,421,5.393939393939394

8033145,1,B0002VETFO,"I bought this in Sept for a Christmas gift...I never opened the packaging to check the discs. When it was opened yesterday, every single disc was scratched and ruined and does not work. And since my return by date was Oct...this purchase was a complete waste of money. Very disappointing. Will not recommend.",1514246400,,308,4.830188679245283

8033147,4,B0002VETFO,These are great.  Disappointed that there is no play all feature. Got these for my mom in a nursing home and she cannot work DVD but can play all and movies last all evening. Didn't see anything in write up that says episodes only.  If you don't care about play all features they are perfect.,1511049600,,292,4.290909090909091
8033148,5,B0002VETFO,"What can I say?  I've been a fan of this show for years and can watch the episodes over and over again.  Being of Italian descent, there are so many familiar moments similar to my own family.  It's gotten to the point where my wife and I discuss the differences in the sets and background props.  Amazingly, I still seem to hear a line I missed before so watching these classic shows never gets old.  We call it ""comfort TV"".",1511049600,,425,4.2625
8033149,5,B0002VETFO,I never get tired of this show. Superb writing and fabulous acting. There is enough truth in this show to pack a punch.,1506988800,,119,4.217391304347826
