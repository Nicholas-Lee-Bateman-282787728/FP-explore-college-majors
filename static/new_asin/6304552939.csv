7874675,4,6304552939,"While much has been written and presented on the RMS Queen Mary's transatlantic career, this video focusses on her second career as a hotel and attraction ship in Long Beach, California.
Starting with somewhat humorous historical footage profiling a growing and ambitious Long Beach of the 1960s which bought the Queen Mary, this video takes viewers amid the throngs of chase boats to view the Queen Mary's grand arrival at her new home.
Transitioning to the modern day, the program takes viewers on a tour of the Queen Mary and her attractions -- everything from her deluxe staterooms and restaurants to the shoreside bungy jump. Combining independent explorations of the ship with portions of actual guided tours, the video effectively conveys the busy atmosphere of a visit to this popular ship.
While this program is an independent production, and doesn't quite have all the polish of a National Geographic documentary, it is still an informative and enjoyable profile of a modern day experience aboard the RMS Queen Mary. Anyone considering a visit to this ship, or wanting a souvenir of a past visit, should get this video.",984528000,2,1129,5.042780748663102
