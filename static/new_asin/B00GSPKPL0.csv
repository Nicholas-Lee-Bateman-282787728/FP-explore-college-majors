https://www.amazon.com/Encounter-Simone-Weil-Soraya-Broukhim/dp/B00GSPKPL0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510874043&sr=8-1&keywords=an+encounter+with+simone+weil&dpID=51tz-iJjLKL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch

This is a beautiful film visually and substantively.

Throughout the film, Weil quotations are spoken, They describe important concepts in her thought, such as attention, suffering, oppression, factory work, beauty, and mystical experience.

She believed in the absolute liberty of the intellect, Hence, she declined to enter the Catholic Church, or to join the Communist  Party, and she was skeptical of all collectivities.

There are many photographs of her in many contexts (After I finish my next read (I recently paid $33.00 for it on Ebay) - The Human Face by Max Picard - Ill watch the film again) .

This film is valuable for two types of people: 1.) Those who have not read Weil, but are curious about her. It will be a good introduction and.

2) Those who have read Weil. Many of the spoken Weil quotations will be familiar. I cherish my copy of Simone Weil - An Anthology, Sian Miles, ed., the best anthology that Ive ever purchased. It cantains an index that is comprehensive and tremendously valuable..  https://www.amazon.com/Simone-Weil-Anthology/dp/0802137296/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1510874283&sr=8-1&keywords=simone+weil+an+anthology&dpID=51PAnn1y4eL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch",1510790400,,1446,6.9944444444444445
8626833,2,B00GSPKPL0,"The title misled me on thinking it was a film focussing only on la Weil and a thorough Reflection of her work, while this is a metareflection on Julia Haslett's relation to Weil.

A deep work but wrongly labelled.",1475712000,3,213,4.461538461538462
8626834,2,B00GSPKPL0,"I think the effort was great and I commend Ms. Haslett for her work, but I think it end up being a movie that is more about her than Simone Weil.",1398038400,7,145,3.7096774193548385
8626835,5,B00GSPKPL0,"Julia Haslett has done a great job introducing Simone Weil to a new audience. Grieving her brother's tragic death, Haslett explores Weil's ideas about affliction, something Weil knew a lot about.  Watching this video will undoubtedly inspire its viewers to learn more about Weil, a woman whose life, philosophy and spirituality are well worth knowing.",1391904000,5,351,5.381818181818182
