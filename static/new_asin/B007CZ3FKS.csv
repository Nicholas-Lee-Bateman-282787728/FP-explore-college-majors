8514834,4,B007CZ3FKS,I can say it's great and used to see this series.  Really can recommend for anime fans dealing with horror.,1520726400,,107,4.35
8514835,3,B007CZ3FKS,"So i found this series interesting but it didn't excite me or made me want to watch. I don't think it's for everyone. It's story is a little hard to follow or understand. First off all the episodes are connected in some fashion. It's hard to tell about the story without giving some key point away ,and some of the story feels like it's left unexplained or that there should be a first season and we should have watched it and know whats happening (i actually looked around to see if there was a first season). All you can do is watch it and try to make sense of it as you go along or hope it will. I wouldn't say it terrible or bad, but i can't say that it's great it's kinda just there to me. I don't regret getting the series or hate having it but if i had watched it before hand i don't think it would have impressed me enough to get it. Boogiepop has a similar art style to kino's journey and kinda has the same feel to. Oh i also wanted to bring this up the episodes has haziness to it and the corners look faded kinda like an old photo. That gives all the episodes a dream like feeling. The sound and music is weird and at some point i didn't care for it.",1456012800,,1162,4.012931034482759

8514837,1,B007CZ3FKS,This anime is horrible. Do not waste your money if you do not like anime that do not have a good story line. There's no plot at all. One of the worse animes ever.,1410998400,,162,3.7941176470588234
8514838,5,B007CZ3FKS,"This is my favorite anime, but it is only for those who can distinguish Art from ""aesthetically pleasing"". It is wonderfully disorienting, challenging, & rewarding. It should appeal to most fans of David Lynch's Eraserhead bizarro eerieness.
I would describe it as the dvd equivalent of 12 jigsaw pieces from a used 50 piece puzzle of a Bosch painting, or else 12 episodic versions of a reoccuring nightmare. Or playing 52 pickup with a deck of traumatic memories of dark & tragic obsessions and relationships. Boogiepop reveals the painful terror of that space between the notes.
Very expressionistic in mood, music, story editing, color palette, sound. Under appreciated gem, nay, masterpiece: yes, it is. Serial Experiments LAIN is the only Anime in Boogiepop's league, artwise, chaoswise.
If you like your mystery stories wrapped up tight in a bow, you want one of the millions of other dvds on this planet.",1397088000,3,911,5.08

8514840,4,B007CZ3FKS,I've wanted this anime for almost 15 years.....and I finally decided to look for it again.....and low and behold I found it.,1389571200,2,124,4.681818181818182
8514841,5,B007CZ3FKS,"Boogiepop Phantom is probably one of the most unusual and confusing anime in existence, but it is very entertaining and mystifying. Each episode concerns itself with a different character, and how they interact with the overall plot. You may see an event in the first episode that does not make any sense, but then you see the same scene in the second episode from a different point of view, and now it makes sense. The series is often compared to the even more confusing anime, Serial Experiments Lain, due to the psychological and philosophical aspect of the two shows.

The show begins with an obsessive compulsive girl who laments that she never told the guy she liked how she felt about him before he died. She later sees Saotome again, despite him being dead, and she confesses her feelings to him. He then tells her that he will eat her, and there will be nothing left of her. At that moment a mysterious figure known as Boogiepop appears and fires an electrical current at the boy, and he dissipates. This is the plot for the first episode. We later learn that Saotome is not himself anymore after he was consumed by a being known as the Manticore.

There is also a young imp of a boy called Poom Poom, who beckons children to play with him. He takes the children's younger selves, and leaves an empty shell of their current beigns. He even causes one girl to kill herself because she was so depressed and had nothing else to live for. Poom Poom is accompanied by a young girl named Manaka, who can create memories of an individual in the form of butterflies. She is a rather innocent, but a strange girl kind of like Shiro from Deadman Wonderland.

There are so many characters in this show that I would feel bad for not including them in this review, but I cannot review them all. Quick examples include: an obsessive computer game designer who cannot tell the difference from a game and reality, a policeman who can turn his head in a 360 degree motion, a mysterious serial killer, a boy who can see imaginary spiders on people and eats the spiders, and many others,

The premise of the show is about a pillar of light that appeared in the city, and now many strange occurrences have been sighted, and many people have strange abilities. Trying to figure out the true story is part of the fun of this series. The anime also has a dark eerie atmosphere to it; most of the anime looks monochrome, but it adds to the experience.

This release is licensed by RightStuf, and they did a really good job with this show. There are English commentaries for all 12 episodes, and they actually help a lot when trying to understand the series. If you like dark, psychological anime, then check this title out.",1381363200,6,2708,4.529652351738242
8514842,2,B007CZ3FKS,Heard much of it but didn't quite live up to the reputation.. Technically not interesting but quite ok with story line.,1379462400,,119,4.714285714285714
8514843,5,B007CZ3FKS,"Many people in the anime fandom have seen, or at the very least heard of, psychological classics such as Serial Experiments Lain, Paranoia Agent, Neon Genesis Evangelion. Maybe they've even delved the depths and explored the even more brooding Texhnolyze or the more uplifting, but nevertheless thought-provoking Haibane Renmei. Sadly, whether it's because of the off-putting name or just unfortunate happenstance, Boogiepop Phantom never reached the same level of popularity; it was left out of the loop. Which is a shame, because it's a damn good show that deserves to have its name etched into the annals of anime history and assume its rightful place among its aforementioned peers.

First off, don't let the name deter you. There's nothing silly about this show. Boogiepop Phantom is an intensely atmospheric mystery with an unsettling vibe to it. Whatever's going on, you never feel quite at ease watching it. Whether it's the dark street corners, a creepy-acting individual, or just the excellent sound design, there's always something to keep you on your toes. I would very much compare it to Ghost Hound in that respect; the clever use of audio editing really pushes the show from good to excellent. There's an almost otherworldy feel to the entire series, dreamlike perhaps, like an expressionistic painting where everything is just a little bit off. There are many memorable scenes, my personal favorite involving a certain police officer.

The plot concerns a string of disappearances of high school students, which are blamed on what's being called an urban legend; the series' namesake, Boogiepop. Just who is Boogiepop? Does she even exist? Naturally, you'll have to watch for yourself to find out. The show requires a bit of patience and attention from the viewer; it's not a sit back and relax sort of series. However, if you enjoyed series like Paranoia Agent and Serial Experiment Lain, you'll feel right at home. If any of this interests you, give Boogiepop Phantom a spin, it's definitely worth your time.

I'm very happy about this Nozomi/Rightstuf re-release of the series, which will hopefully give it a little more exposure, and which allowed me to pick it up for pretty damn cheap all things considered. For a 20 dollar price tag, there's a surprising amount of extras, as well as an English dub. Very nice. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that all four DVDs feature the same image. It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but it is ultimately only a nitpick, which doesn't hurt the overall experience. The cover art looks great and the case itself is suitably dark.

It should go without saying at this point, but this show can be more than a little disturbing. But if you've read this far, I'm sure that's more of an enticement than a deterrence. Boogiepop Phantom gets two enthusiastic thumbs up from this humble reviewer.",1348272000,23,2859,4.925311203319502
