8723076,5,B010ROCMOA,Awesome show! Really happy to have the complete collection. At such a bargain it was cheaper to buy this than buy the individual seasons. Great show that you'll sure to really enjoy.,1512604800,,182,4.71875
8723077,5,B010ROCMOA,"The first season of the following is the best. Great pacing, Amazing horror. The series wraps up with a great ending, so you don't feel ""jipped"" since it was canceled.",1497312000,2,167,4.6
8723078,5,B010ROCMOA,"Very good series! Will keep you anxious to see what happens. Pleased I bought this, and bought one for a friend also.

I can't help but compare this show to DEXTER just a little bit.

Very strong recommendation to watch this show!",1480809600,2,230,4.4523809523809526
