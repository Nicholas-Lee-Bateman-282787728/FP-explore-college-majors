7808728,5,6300276813,"""Here's Mickey!"" was the first in a series of 14 videos, each with a trio of classic cartoons from the Disney library and usually based on a common theme. Naturally, the three cartoons on this collection are three Mickey Mouse classics. While none of the cartoons were in black and white (a shame, that), none were poor choices at all. The first two Mickey Cartoons portray Mickey as he was later on, with a more expressive face and cheeks slightly bulged out. The first of these is ""Mickey's Birthday Party,"" which is a great tribute to the early Mickey cartoons in which the scenario is a party. All of the usual Disney characters at the time are present, including Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy, Pluto, and some regular supporting characters. Short number 2 is actually a color remake of the 1934 cartoon ""Orphan's Benefit."" This was significant because when it originally debuted, it was the first appearance that Donald Duck would make after his screen debut as a supporting character in the Silly Symphony ""Wise Little Hen."" All of the supporting characters as described in the previous cartoon are present, as well as Mickey's obnoxious, taunting orphan mice. Finally, an earlier one is showcased as we head into ""Mickey's Garden."" In a way, this is NOT a good one for your children, as there is a heavy drug reference. After Mickey inhales too much bug poison, he begins to see his garden come to life and grow, along with encountering some life-size bugs. Definetely an inhalants reference. However, it is by far one of the best cartoons to feature Mickey past his years in black and white. Overall, a great start to what would be a great series of short videocassettes. Look for it at a bargain store or something-you won't be disappointed.",1151280000,3,1750,4.798013245033113
