Plus the DVD came with the soundtrack which is way cool. Sure I have seen gnarlier slams, but don't you hate if when a video features like 10 slams over the coarse of 2 hours and just keeps showing them over and over again? Or worse there is some lame commentary along with it? I think Slammed was cool. I'd highly recommend it.",1122508800,,483,4.260869565217392
8020599,4,B00022FW4A,"(More like 3.5 to 4.0 stars) As an avid collector of the Crusty Demons of Dirt series, TGR, and Transworld Snowboarding videos, I'd rank ""Slammed"" as ranging from somewhat decent to pretty good, especially considering 1. the price and 2. its range of coverage of extreme sports and 3. its intimate look into the risks that these people take on to keep us entertained and motivated to push ourselves. With all due respect to Mr. Stock, I say judge for yourself. If you think it does suck, then you didn't blow a whole lot of money in purchasing it (especially if it's a used version).",1121558400,,583,4.561904761904762
8020600,1,B00022FW4A,"I've seen worse slams, and the soundtrack just plain sucks.  After about the 5th time of listening to stupid screaming music and the same slams over and over it just gets old.  Don't waste your time.",1111536000,,199,4.5
