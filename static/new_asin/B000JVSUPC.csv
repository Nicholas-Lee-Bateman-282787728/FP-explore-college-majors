8153340,5,B000JVSUPC,"I was searching for an introductory video for beginning saxophone students. This DVD offers a professionally produced and upbeat series of lessons appropriate for those just starting to play -- from day one as the title suggests. Eric Marienthal is an accomplished and very inspiring musician and his solid musical education shows throughout this presentation. The pace and production of this video is particularly effective in reaching the younger player, but works equally well with mature students who are just beginning.

The content of the material is well organized and moves quickly with energy and flair, so students are not likely to lose interest. The convenience of easy lesson review is most helpful. My only reservation is that this 60-minute video covers only introductory material...  and does it well. However, students who have seriously studied for more than a few months will probably find this material too basic. With that limitation in mind, Eric Marienthal's instructional video offers an excellent series of lessons for students just starting out on saxophone and includes many important tips that beginning players miss or are simply not taught.",1358035200,2,1170,5.353260869565218
8153341,4,B000JVSUPC,This book does take you from day one.  It is a good beginners book but you need to have self motivation.  For users that have not played for awhile the last few chapters offer some good refresher lessons.,960768000,2,204,4.342105263157895
