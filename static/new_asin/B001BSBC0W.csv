3498883,5,B001BSBC0W,Nothing like reliving past glory. HTTR,1453507200,,38,5.5
3498884,5,B001BSBC0W,3 Great Complete Original Broadcast Super Bowls in 1 set. These are mid-eighties Super Bowls when the Redskins ruled. The quality is as good as the original broadcasts were.,1448409600,,173,5.0

3498886,5,B001BSBC0W,"Excelente product, looking forward for the next purchase.",1424390400,,57,6.25
3498887,4,B001BSBC0W,"Its the complete broadcasts of the Superbowl wins, with some of the dead time taken out. Some people complain about the fact some junk between plays is missing, but when I see old games, my finger is on the Fast forward button every other down. 2 and half hours is ALOT of time. In every Football game, there is only about 30-40 minutes of on field action, from the presnap motion to the whistle blown. The great plays, require more than one replay, and that's the advantage of a DVD where u can rewind and slow mo all you want.  So it takes an hour to see a really good game that's happened already.  But this is why a truly epic game can go to 2 and a half hours ANYWAY, but at least it was all action, not close ups of players helmets milling about, hoping to catch some facial expressions and drama while the commentator drones on.
  The 1997 Superbowl Denver Greenbay, has to be considered one of the greatest games ever played.  It took me 3 hours to watch it on a treasured DVD.  The Redskins Eagles games of the past few years, have been quite epic, its a rivalry being ignored. Sure the Eagles won more, but I am a disinterested observer, I'm just watching for the action. If Eagles fans taunt any of you, remind them they're the only team in the greatest division in terms of superbowl berths and wins..... yet, they alone have no rings, while the rest of us have at least 3.
Its too bad the Redskins don't have enough Epic Postseason games, meaning, they were close and exciting to the very end.",1419897600,,1506,4.322695035460993

3498889,5,B001BSBC0W,Nice. Needs to be on bluray and digital,1408579200,,39,4.0
3498890,4,B001BSBC0W,It was the first time in along time that I got to watch all three Super Bowl victories. I do think their are more games they can package together especially from those 80s and early 90s teams.,1404604800,,192,4.216216216216216
3498891,4,B001BSBC0W,"The quality of these games are amazing. Falls short of 5 stars because of the issues with Super Bowl XXVI (vs Bills) where every TD celebration is cut and quickly goes to the extra point. It's unusual and can be annoying. Not sure why they do this for only this game out of the three.

Doesn't have any extras. Doesn't show their opening promos. Still worth the purchase.",1400112000,,371,4.455882352941177
3498892,5,B001BSBC0W,"The Super Bowl sucked, the adds sucked and the halftime show sucked, so i bought this to relive the great times of my favorite team and players. My NFL season was saved. It was great watching Riggo and the HOGs. Doug Williams blew away the Broncs without the marijuana. Cannot wait till next season.",1392422400,,299,4.555555555555555

3498894,5,B001BSBC0W,"Huge Skins fan!!! I just hope they win another ring before I retire. The videos are good in sound and video quality, no complaints.",1384819200,,131,4.5
3498895,5,B001BSBC0W,At least you get to watch the whole Superbowl. But it would be nice to watch the whole season leading up to and including the Superbowl. So people who did would know the whole truth of the season.,1384646400,,196,4.184210526315789
3498896,5,B001BSBC0W,"Redskins fans get this set and enjoy! Fun to relive and remember, I enjoyed every minute and had to watch Riggins performance again and again!",1367884800,,142,4.72
3498897,3,B001BSBC0W,Wanted to watch the Doug Williams Super Bowl 15 minute 35 point explosion but the disc was ^%$&* so yeah that sucks. THe other discs worked though.,1366761600,,147,4.481481481481482
3498898,5,B001BSBC0W,Another must have for the Redskin fan.  You get to watch great football games from the old days whenever you want.,1365206400,,114,4.428571428571429
3498899,4,B001BSBC0W,The packaging was perfect.  I love football and I cant wait for the season to start.  I am ready for football.,1363737600,,110,4.190476190476191
3498900,5,B001BSBC0W,"Nothing better than reliving some great Superbowl memories of the past.
Having these on DVD to Redskins fan is like having gold.

3498901,5,B001BSBC0W,"Do I even need to tell you why? Get to re-live all the Super Bowl victories. Loved seeing the original broadcast.
HTTR!",1359331200,,119,4.454545454545454
3498902,5,B001BSBC0W,I attended 2 of these games.  This is nice to have if you're a true Washington Redskin fan.  All 3 of these are games are worth watching over and over again.  Hail to the Redskins!,1357862400,,180,4.085714285714285
3498903,5,B001BSBC0W,"This DVD is exactly what it's described as - network broadcasts of the 3 Super Bowl victories of the Washington Redskins.  I know other reviewers want other games included as the ""Greatest"", and I think the 1982 NFC Championship victory over the Cowboys is one of the greatest, but these are the Super Bowl victories.  If winning the World Championship isn't the greatest, then what is?  No need to rate down this set because it doesn't include such-and-such game.  For what it advertises, this DVD set delivers.  Audio and video quality are what should be expected, and while the games are slightly edited, I didn't feel that it took away from the games at all.  Pregame player introductions were still there, and there was a little postgame footage as well.  I'd searched in vain for Super Bowl XVII, and this is by far the best one around.",1357603200,,842,4.687074829931973
3498904,5,B001BSBC0W,I absolutely love the redskins and to enjoy them over and over again is awesome. I recommend this to any redskins fan.,1356393600,,118,4.409090909090909
3498905,5,B001BSBC0W,Nice to sit back on the couch and watch the Skins win the big game whenever I feel like it!,1301616000,,91,3.6
3498906,4,B001BSBC0W,"This is a great little set. The original broadcasts of all 3 Redskins superbowl victories. You get the FULL TV broadcast, minus the garbage halftime entertainment. As other's have said though, that's it. There is no additional commentary or analysis, and the quality is what it is. This is especially noticeable in the '83 superbowl broadcast. But for the price, I ain't complaining. It's really cool to watch these, especially for you young bucks who are way too young to remember a time when the Redskins were actually good (and often dominant), and well-respected. And you can't beat a game called by Madden and Summerall.",1299024000,,625,4.961904761904762
3498907,3,B001BSBC0W,"The Redskins, like the Raiders, Steelers and 49ers had many other great games outside of there super bowls. How about the 1972, 1982, and 1983 NFC Championships? 1990 wildcard win vs Eagles? 1986 and 1987 divisional playoff wins vs Bears?",1275436800,,238,4.975
3498908,5,B001BSBC0W,"This is a great product, and I'm so glad someone has taken the time and effort to make them available.  I totally enjoyed revisiting these games from a more innocent time, when players were honest men and pro football was more fun.  The packaging is well done, and all three discs played well, with the quality limited only by the timeframe and technology (The quality is actually great when you consider the recording technology of the time and the fact that I'm watching them blown up on a 50"" plazma TV.)  Total enjoyment and no problems.",1268092800,,541,4.614583333333333
3498909,3,B001BSBC0W,"Winning the Super Bowl is great, and watching these games is awesome. However, any true Redskins fan will tell you that the two greatest games in 'Skins history are the NFC Championship wins over Dallas. In fact, you could make an entire set out of wins over Dallas alone. The Ken Houston game, the last RFK game, even the Monday nighter in week 2 of 1991.
  By the way, Why is it that some teams get Greatest Games collections of up to 10 games, and the Redskins only get 3? It's time for an updated set.",1252627200,,505,4.25
3498910,4,B001BSBC0W,"This 3-disc set seems perfunctory for one of the great franchises in the NFL. Other people have made good suggestions for future games to release. I'd also love to see some games from just prior to the Super Bowl years, like:
-1979 win over Dallas at RFK

-1980 wk 15 last-minute win over the Giants

-1981 wk 6 over Bears. 1st Gibbs win.

-1981 wk 10 33-31 shootout win over the Lions

these are just a few suggestions",1244246400,,419,4.333333333333333
3498911,4,B001BSBC0W,"Well, the visual quality that is available on this DVD set is second to none (out of everything that has been available so far). It is very clear. Now, these sets do contain every play in these three Super Bowls (including the false start opening kickoff of Super Bowl XXVI). The footage is the same footage as the original TV broadcasts, along with commentary by the original TV game announcers. These are the strengths of the set.

The only weakness that I perceive that this set has is that the games are still somewhat edited. Some of the action between plays is edited out. So, you may see the end of a punt play, and then it might immediately cut to the next team's quarterback taking the snap, for example. So, a lot of times things that will be missing are the players going into and out of the huddle, coming onto the field, etc. In Super Bowl 26, for example, they almost completely cut out a touchdown celebration by Gerald Riggs. I imagine that for a few people, 'cutting to the chase' in this way may be preferred, but for me, these edits create a slightly artificial feel to the games on these DVDs. This is because I consider the things that were cut out to be a part of watching a football game, such as touchdown celebrations. I think it would have been better if NFL Films had released the whole game EXACTLY as broadcast on TV, except without the commercials (of course). At any rate, NFL Films should have left that stuff in, to allow you as the viewer to decide what is important enough to want to watch; if it's on the DVD, you can always fast-forward it if you don't want to watch it. But if it's not there to begin with, then you don't even have the option of watching it. If you want the whole, uncut games, you're going to have to look elsewhere.

For having the great visual quality, and every play, but also due to the edits, I give this collection Four Stars.",1233878400,,1888,4.360795454545454
3498912,5,B001BSBC0W,"Excellent quality for these 3 Super Bowl games. Would have been nice to have more classic games in this collection than just the Redskins 3 Super Bowl wins, but a nice group of games. Enjoyable to watch, even for a non-Redskins fan like me.",1233360000,,240,4.4772727272727275
3498913,5,B001BSBC0W,This is a great collection of the Redskins' three Super Bowl victories.  It was great going back and actually reliving some of those great moments.  Who can ever forget that great run by John Riggins???,1232150400,,202,4.742857142857143
3498914,4,B001BSBC0W,"Let's be 100% clear about what this is: the 3 Super Bowl games in this set are simply the TV broadcasts of the games, as they were presented at the times (1983, 1988, 1992). No window dressing, no sugar-coating, no bells, and no whistles. While it would've been (very) nice to have included SOME highlights (or even brief mentions) of the playoff games to led up to each Super Bowl game, and definitely better to have the RADIO audio (Sonny, Sam, & Frank) versus the TV commentators, it's still a triumph to FINALLY have a copy of the Super Bowl games themselves, esp. for myself, not having a VCR back in 1983.

I hope (against hope) NFL Films will see fit to go back and retrieve the radio commentary for these games (NFLF does include snippets of radio play-by-play in every other Redskins' DVD highlight set they sell).  This set is for WS fans, and I'd much rather hear the voices of my ""homer"" radio announcers than ""objective"" TV heads. Makes me ever thankful I did manage to record (VHS) the 1992 Super Bowl with both the television AND radio commentary!",1226448000,,1062,4.554973821989528
3498915,4,B001BSBC0W,"It will be great to have these Super Bowl victories on DVD, but any 'Skins fan worth their salt knows that their greatest games didn't necessarily happen in the Super Bowl. Here are some suggestions for future games to release in this format:

*1982 wk 7 v. NY Giants

3498916,4,B001BSBC0W,"Actually there were three playoff games the redskins played before facing Miami in the Super Bowl because of the players strike in 1982.  They beat Detroit 31-7,Minnesota 21-7 and Dallas 31-17 in the NFC Title Game, and then followed by beating Miami 27-17 in the Super Bowl. Hopefully,this set will contain all of these games...",1215388800,,329,4.9818181818181815
3498917,5,B001BSBC0W,"This set will include the 3 Super Bowls won by the Washington Redskins and NOT the 1982 playoff games implied by the Amazon listing.  The games included are:

*Super Bowl XVII - the Redskins defeated the Miami Dolphins, 27-17, for their first NFL title since 1942.

*Super Bowl XXII - by scoring 42 unanswered points, the Redskins defeated the Denver Broncos, 42-10, for their second Super Bowl victory.
