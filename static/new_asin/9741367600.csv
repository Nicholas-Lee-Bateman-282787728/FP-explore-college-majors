7901740,2,9741367600,"One of the most boring, plotless, shallow, and repetitive series I have ever seen; awful. I watch exclusively Asian movies, ""foreign,"" and mostly Korean. I need the subtitles; when it comes to good stuff, the Koreans usually deliver.

But not this time. The acting was superb, yes, Koreans cry beautifully, and there's plenty of that, and the girls are impossibly beautiful and exotic, as are the men. However, as these things go---this series does not stack up on a deeper level. Also, the fight scenes are boring, repetitive, and un redeeming

Watch it if you want; and, if you like your tv series, you can keep it. And if you like your script and plot, nobody can take it away from you. Period.

7901742,4,9741367600,"This series  displays Korea as a highly developed and sophisticated culture, whose court intrigues and martial traditions deserve greater attention.
  The time setting is in the late 1500's (I think,  as matchlock firearms are in use).  The general plot is over two brothers- one is ambitious to rise in status, the other is leader of a warrior secret order sworn to the korean king called the Black swords.
  Their loyalties bring them into conflict,  as do the courtiers they serve.  The kings swordsman at one point ends up in  Japan, where he is compelled to fight deadly gladiatorial contests.  He eventually makes his way back to his king, and to get revenge.
  This is an enthusiastic swordslinger series with significant amounts of mayhem and gore (not as sloshy as the Spartacus series).  The subplots are numerous,  with everyone having an agenda, and nefarious ideas for their accomplishment.
  The ladies are lovely and smart, the men intelligent and dangerous.  The fight scenes are intense and bloody.  Court intrigues are
subtle and deadly.  My kind of entertainment.",1368921600,,1082,5.074285714285714
