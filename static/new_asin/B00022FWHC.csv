2056219,1,B00022FWHC,"Ordered a DVD of this movie, but recieved the VHS version.  I can't imagine how that could happen, who buys VHS anymore?",1347580800,,120,4.454545454545454
2056220,5,B00022FWHC,This is a great movie and is really interesting on the subject of personal connections. The lovely Ms. Mortimer steals the show. A great story line. Interesting locations for the back ground and some amazing acting buy a unique cast. A real keeper and at the price how do you loose? Go Prime for the full service !,1334966400,,314,4.431034482758621
2056221,5,B00022FWHC,Great movie. Halarious. Such fun. A clasic. Highly underated and not easy to find around here now. A guide how not to do things but comes out well.,1316304000,,147,4.285714285714286
2056222,4,B00022FWHC,"This is a movie about what people need vs want.  Three people with different needs and how to accomplish getting them, but very different wants.  Great acting and storyline.",1258502400,2,173,4.931034482758621
2056223,3,B00022FWHC,"The story was somewhat interesting. But, the plot lacked a deeper exploration of one of the characters, the one played by Emily Mortimer. The only thing we know about her is that she is an single English journalist living in Russia. David Arquette seemed lost as to what to do with his character. Nelson was pretty good and the chemistry between Nelson and Mortimer was interesting.

Slow at first, the movie picked up its pace when the brothers, Josh and Jake, arrived in Russia. But, this is where the plot seemed to get a bit lost. With a inconclusive and unsatisfying resolution, the movie failed to keep me interested in Josh all that much, and failed to make me understand a bit more about Jake.",1209254400,,701,4.608
2056224,4,B00022FWHC,"You will actually get to see an interesting slice of life in this movie.  While the movie itself may be okay, the performances are what really stand out.  Time Blake Nelson's performance is worth the price of admission as the lovable loser who...., well..., that would be telling.

When their mother dies, two brother set out to find a ""wife"" who will take care of the both of them. They spend their savings on a marriage ""tour"" of Eastern Europe.

What you may not know is that the movie was actually supported by a real marriage agency, and many of their fellow tourists are actual visitors in search of a foreign bride.

It is a classic fish out of water tale, that while a bit contrived, nevertheless will pull you into their story.

Four Stars.

Cheers!",1204675200,,758,4.529411764705882
2056225,4,B00022FWHC,"The previous reviews nicely give a synopsis of the plot, so I won't repeat what has been written. Like a couple of other reviewers, I, too, am a fan of the talented British actress Emily Mortimer (DEAR FRANKIE). She brings a natural beauty to the role of the Documentarian that is refreshing in its warmth and sincerity. She obviously loves her job and the spectacular city of Saint Petersburg. I wish I could visit St. Petersurg someday, though there many other cities around the world that I'd like to see first. It truly is  beautiful, even in winter when 2 BROTHERS & A BRIDE was filmed. As far as it being a comedy goes, it is definitely an understated one. The brothers Jake and Josh Adams (Tim Blake Nelson and David Arquette) play it down as two Middle-America yokels in search of a wife to replace their deceased mother. They only want a woman to cook and wash and clean house for them...just for two years until she is eligible to get a Green Card. The story revolves around them finding the right girl as quickly as possible before they run out of time and money (the tour is only for two weeks and they each have $4,000 to spend during that time). While the ending is somewhat predictable, the journey there is entertaining. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a comedy for adults.",1189382400,3,1309,4.5
2056226,5,B00022FWHC,My favorite movies are those with interesting characters and engrossing dialogue.  This movie has both and was delightful and entertaining.,1142208000,5,139,5.95
2056227,5,B00022FWHC,"I'll be honest. I only watched this movie because it has Emily Mortimer in it. The first time, anyway. The second, third, and fourth times were for the very simple reason that I loved the movie. Action lovers be warned: it moves at a VERY slow pace (although, for some reason, it never drags), and its appeal lies almost entirely in the performances of Tim Blake Nelson and Emily Mortimer. Maybe I should explain a bit.

The film is about two brothers (shocking, isn't it?) whose late mother spoiled them beyond reason. They are incapable of fending for themselves, even to do laundry. Their home is such a disaster that they cannot even find a maid who is willing to work more than one day. Desperate, they finally reach the obvious (!?) conclusion. Wife! Using the actual international matchmaking agency A Foreign Affair, the older brother, Jake (Nelson) books tickets to Russia, where they hope to find a woman who will keep house in exchange for a green card.

Once they reach St. Petersburg, though, the brothers find they are not the only ones interested in Russian brides. A documentary filmmaker (Mortimer) offers to translate for Jake as long as he allows her to follow him around with a camera in his face. Both brothers begin to learn a bit more about themselves, women, and the world at large.

The movie was shot in an almost documentary style, including several interviews with real men who had actually gone to St. Petersburg to find wives. Seriously. But if this were a documentary, it would be the most hilarious one I ever watched. The movie is obviously not for everyone. If you like black comedy, this is the way to go, but if your taste runs more towards gags and obvious jokes, avoid it like the plague!",1137456000,18,1726,4.6524590163934425
2056228,3,B00022FWHC,"Jake (Tim Blake Nelson) and Josh (David Arquette) are brothers who live on a Midwestern farm where their mother (Lois Smith) takes care of them and dotes on spoiled, child-like Josh. When their mother dies, the brothers are left at loose ends  Finding that they aren't good at taking care of themselves, they decide they need a wife to do the cooking and cleaning. So it's off to St. Petersburg, Russia on a ""Romance Tour"" to find a homemaker in exchange for a Green Card.

""Two Brothers and a Bride"" combines a study of the brothers' relationship and romantic realities with self-consciously corny comedy. Tim Blake Nelson and David Arquette are accomplished character actors, whose performances are almost not superficial enough for a romantic comedy. They're joined by the talented Emily Mortimer as a British documentarian who is filming foreign men who have journeyed to Russia in search of wives. ""Two Brothers and a Bride"" has its moments. Jake's methodical quest for a wife/housekeeper is at times very funny. But somehow the corny stuff, irony, and relationship drama don't converge successfully. The film isn't bad, but it's awkward.

The DVD: Bonus features include filmographies for Emily Mortimer, David Arquette, and Tim Blake Nelson, as well as ""A Foreign Affair Virtual Tour"", which is a 5-minute infomercial for the Foreign Affair ""Romance Tour"" that the characters in the movie take. By the way, ""A Foreign Affair""  and its tours are real. Their web address is [...] .",1099008000,14,1486,5.028455284552845
8020513,4,B00022FWHC,My guess is that this is close to a real story of men looking for a woman to play a role that their mother served. And it had a coming to age story of a man who had played his second child role for farm life that is going out of style.  It was interesting.,1490486400,,256,3.6545454545454548
8020514,1,B00022FWHC,"I want my time back! Thank you Amazon for having the forward button otherwise I'd really be upset. I thought once they got to Russia the movie would get much better, it didn't. It did get a little better, I hung in to the end and was disappointed, it was better than the beginning though.",1488758400,,288,4.254545454545455
8020515,5,B00022FWHC,"This is a movie about two lonesome grown-up brothers from the Midwest...on a farm. Their mother, who was taking care of her sons as if they had never grown-up. They were both pampered and ""spoon-fed""....even thou they were both grown men. When their mother died. The boys thought that the world had ended....they did not know how to feed themselves....sort of sickening they were in. So, they had some money, and decided to fly to Russia and get themselves a ""sort of mother"" replacement....via one of those ""we will find you a beautiful wife in Russia."" You pay the bill and we will get you a woman...to marry you. I have to admit the Russian woman in the movie were absolutely Beautiful! The boys had a lot of choices. Patricia the lead woman in this movie...is beautiful. She did actually grad. from an English University-- England. She majored in Russian language...so they chose a perfect woman as the lead female role. She is beautiful herself. In summary, if you have a sentimental nature...and care for other people...love that is...you will enjoy this movie. The acting is outstanding. I have the movie at home...and watch in at times...I loved this movie, I hope you will also!",1463356800,,1187,4.795121951219512
