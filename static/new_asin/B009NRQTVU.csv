8543198,3,B009NRQTVU,"4 disks of English history - some castles & a few palaces, but 3/4 of all of it is historical info. The entire set bounces from 400 BC, to 1920 back to 1137 then up to current periods. If the first disk began in the far past and over the series they come toward the present it would be more enjoyable and easier to follow. I'm sorry to say I fast forwarded through most of it, as I was interested in the architecture, not town fairs or monotonous history lessons, some of repeated several times. Save your money!",1518566400,,512,4.23469387755102

They're informative, next best thing to visiting the royal properties in person, or as a precursor to a visit as you'll know to look for details you might have missed otherwise.",1495929600,,319,4.888888888888889

8543203,5,B009NRQTVU,"Wow. this DVD is so jam packed with unusual information that you can watch it many times and get new information each time.  Very interesting stories, things I have never heard on any other DVD about England.  I love English history, and if you do too you will enjoy this. Stories about parks,estates, why things are done, interviews with interesting and quirky people.  Fun.
 One problem I should mention is audio quality.  The voices of the participants are either really loud or you can't hear them hardly.
This is a older work, and it was on T.V. maybe that's the reason??  No matter, that is why we have a volume control:)",1409097600,2,627,4.603603603603603

8543206,4,B009NRQTVU,"This is ""Crown and Country"" , originally presented several years ago by Edward Windsor. They have taken him out and a woman is 'reading' his lines. Every so often you can see him in shots taken during the filming. they have added a little and left out some, but it is the same show.
Saying that, it was a very good program then and is still a wonderful insight into England. If you missed ""Crown and Country"" and enjoy English history and folklore, then you will love this.",1358985600,25,473,4.386363636363637
