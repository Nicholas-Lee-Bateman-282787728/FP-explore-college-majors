1784254,1,B00006L942,"I bought the collection with the hope that I was going to see an informative and historical series, instead I found myself in disbelieve of the contents and the assertions of some of their ""investigators"". These ""investigators"" try to railroad people towards the bible in all their cd's. The first cd: Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt and the Aegean is just a small bits of historical facts with a whole bunch of ""support"" for the ""historical"" existence of the bible and the narrator tries to tie these bits of history with episodes in the bible. The one that takes the ""cake"", is the one on the Mayan civilization. After explaining and reiterating, and repeating about the grandiose of the empire and all the knowledge in mathematics and astronomy, they go on and on in saying that there is a ""hidden"" fact that was ""recently"" discovered. This ""fact"" is that the civilization was lost because they didn't believe in God (that is the Christian God). The whole series is just a sad excuse to justify the existence of the bible and the ""goodness"" of Christianism. I just can't believe that Time-Life will sell this collection as ""historical"". Label like it is: ""taking bits of history to give a religion a ""historical"" justification.",1125100800,54,1225,4.866028708133971
1784255,5,B00006L942,"I teach high school ancient history and these DVD's are pure gold - don't pass them by! The DVD's on Tibet, Egypt, Classical Greece, Minoans, Rome, the Inca, the Maya, & China are great. The DVD on Africa is a bunch of P.C.ism - it is the only bad one in the bunch. I only wish they would've done a DVD on India &/or the Aztec instead of the Africa DVD.",1108944000,78,353,3.9859154929577465
1784256,5,B00006L942,"I have been collecting this series on vhs tapes for afew years now, but have come up against a brick wall now as far as finding any more are concerned. If anybody out there has any information about were i can buy any it would be very much appreiciated. The numbers  i am looking for are; 12;16;17;18;24: Thanks",1360627200,,311,4.362068965517241
1784257,5,B00006L942,"Really great for our Ancient Civilizations class.  I've tried to find newer DVD's(to update some of the info).  Can't find one that even comes close. Used it for the last 10years, and just bought a  new copy.",1360454400,,208,4.5675675675675675
1784258,5,B00006L942,"I have watched this for entertainment. It is very entertaining as well as informative. In particular I have enjoyed the cd's on the ancient Mayans and ancient Africa.
This series has also taught me the origin of the myth of the lost city of Atlantis!",1328572800,,250,4.5777777777777775
1784259,1,B00006L942,"In the first section, focusing on Assyria and Babylon, there is the underlying theme that the Hebrews got the idea for their law from the Code of Hammurabi when they were captive in Babylon.  This completely ignores the fact that the law was given through Moses much much earlier.  This is really messed up.  If you are thinking of using this to supplement homeschooling, and you believe the bible to be the inspired Word of God, please be aware of this.  I'm 30 minutes into it and the overriding theme thus far is that the archeological evidence for the biblical events are showing the historical events to be true, but other than that all the ideas were based on their influence by pagan culture, namely Babylonian.",1324857600,7,718,4.674603174603175
1784260,2,B00006L942,"I purchased these as instructional DVDs for my World History Class. So far, I have not been able to use them. In my opinion, although the information is interesting and I enjoyed them, the information is not presented in a format designed for the modern classroom. In fairness to the videos, they were produced before the National Standards were implemented, and as such don't really follow the curriculum. I've watched Mesopotamia and Egypt since receiving the videos. Mesopotamia dealt primarily with the concept of Eden and relied heavily on the Bible, and Egypt focused almost exclusively on archaeology in the 1800s, mummies, and had a 20 second scene with a topless woman, whose purpose I still haven't deduced. I'm disappointed because I had hoped these would be great visual aids for the classroom, but I won't be able to use them. Teachers beware.",1316390400,13,856,4.993006993006993
1784261,5,B00006L942,"Ive watched lots of these kinds of history programs over the years and this series is without question my favorite. I simply cannot say enough about it. I love  the sense of omninous dread in the Mayan episode, especially the scene of the Mayan calendar,  building up with nail biting intensity to the end of the world. The Roman and Chinese episodes evoke the  grandeur and power of these empires. On and on it goes. But overarching it all is Sam Waterston's terrific narration. With the background music perfectly matching, Waterston expertly adjusts his voice to evoke the emotion intended for the viewer; awe, terror, amazement, dread, etc. I cannot think of anyone who could have done a better job at narration. If you have not scene this series, buy it.",1311206400,2,759,4.778625954198473
1784262,5,B00006L942,"The videos are not boring documentaries, but are action-packed and keep students engaged in learning.  Definitely an asset to any World History class!",1302652800,,150,5.521739130434782
1784263,1,B00006L942,"I made the mistake of buying this collection for my middle school based on the favorable reviews here. What a terrible waste of money. The Mesopotamia DVD is not about Mesopotamia, rather it's a feeble attempt to prove the stories of the Christian bible. Not at all suitable for public school, and not a good source of information.  The Egyptian DVD has very little to tell the viewer about Ancient Egypt's lost civilization, but instead uses tired stock footage black and white film clips to tell the stories of tomb robbers of the 19th and 20th centuries. The movies sent my students and I to sleep, and I am very sorry that I wasted my money on this junk.  I recommend instead the excellent ""Engineering an Empire"" from the History Channel, which is very informative, well made and interesting to both students and teachers.",1296259200,26,827,4.736111111111111
1784264,2,B00006L942,"This is a warning for some potential buyers, and perhaps a selling point for others. The DVD has heavy Christian overtones. The first words of the first segment, which is supposed to be about the civilization of Mesopotamia, are: ""The Garden of Eden..."" It goes on to indicate it is inspired by an investigation into proving the stories of the Bible are true. I watched further and discovered the theme to be sustained enough to make it not useful for my purposes. The narrator, for instance, refers to time periods according to their proximity to, ""...the time of Jesus...""

In a Christian school, or for Christians home-schooling, this would probably be good material for a social studies class, but it doesn't work in a secular school with students representing the full array of the world's faiths and cultures.",1289088000,32,815,4.905797101449275
1784265,5,B00006L942,"Time Life's Lost Civilizations, 4 DVD's  How enlightening!  The subjects are well researched and presented nicely with pictures and narrative.  I was shocked to learn where the native Americans DNA came from, what Zimbabwe meant.  We lived in Bellville, IL and knew of the Native-American Cahokia Mound, IL.

The product is packaged neatly.",1285027200,,340,5.339622641509434
1784266,5,B00006L942,"I was the producer and director of two of these shows (Egypt and Mesopotamia) and I appreciate all the kind words.  The reason there are so many biblical references is that this was a commercial project (Time Life/NBC) and many people are interested in the bible.  This series also represents the end of an era, in that very few historical or cultural documentaries are made with budgets as large as these (close to a million dollars each).  They are commercial shows, however, so they have a greater emphasis on entertainment than on ideas or complex history (which explains all the biblical references), but for that reason they were quite popular.  A tremendous amount of travel was done for this series and there are (by contemporary standards) very high production values at each location.  Cranes and steadicams were used to keep the camera moving in many locations, for instance and the crews were generally quite large.  The executive at Time Life who originated the series left in the middle of production and the new executive, appalled at the cost, tried at first to cancel the project and then, having determined that too much money had already been spent to make that sensible, tried to slash the budgets.  The project went on to win a prime-time Emmy.

I encourage you to buy the series, but sadly, I won't be making any money from the sale.",1283904000,36,1355,4.785407725321888
1784267,5,B00006L942,I purchased this for my father (54) for Christmas and he loves it! A great purchase for a history buff (but not a history know-it-all).,1265328000,,135,4.44
1784268,3,B00006L942,"Someone watching these may think that they have an idea of the history involved, but this script line is the approved version in most cases.
The Archeology isn't covered as well as it probably should be.
I liked the style in any case with expert cameos.",1242086400,4,253,4.521739130434782
1784269,5,B00006L942,"I have used this series for years (on VHS).  Now, the tapes are wearing out.  I didn't hesitate to purchase on DVD.",1233792000,3,115,4.181818181818182
1784270,4,B00006L942,This is a good documentary on ancient civilizations. I bought it with the assumption that it would cover the general history of each civilization but it shows more of the way of life of these peoples instead of chronologically ordered history. If you are want to learn about history then I would advise a different documentary.,1231113600,4,327,4.857142857142857
1784271,5,B00006L942,This is a great set. You not only see the wonderful sights of these countries but you are learning as well. Great for the whole family.,1210204800,2,135,4.230769230769231
1784272,5,B00006L942,"This DVD set is truly a great treasure a world history class. I really wanted a DVD set which covered all the ancient civilizations and this set does that superbly. The only ancient civilization it doesn't cover is Ancient Japan. Each 50 minute segment covers the culture, history and religion of an area but with a specific investigative perspective. This DVD set is very informative and interesting.",1183939200,7,401,5.0
1784273,5,B00006L942,"Being a homeschool mom I am always looking for the most interesting, hold your attention type ways of teaching history.  I have watched several tapes on ancient history that were dry & rather dull.  ""Lost Civilizations"" is anything but dull.  My 9 yr. old loves it, and even my 6 yr. old will sit for 45 minutes at a time and watch it.  It covers Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt & the Aegean on Vol. 1.  Greece, China & Rome on Vol. 2.  The Maya's and The Inca's on Vol. 3.  Africa and Tibet on Vol. 4. The scenery is breath-taking!  We watch the tapes every year as a review.  And if you can believe it, my kids put it in sometimes for fun.  I highly recommend this set!",1162512000,89,666,4.173228346456693
1784274,4,B00006L942,"If you are someone who would think nothing of spending $25 on a 50 minute PBS documentary, this might not be the ideal set for you.  It's appeal to me was its value.  It covered a huge amount of material in an acceptable, if not always outstanding, manner.

A previous reviewer complained about the amount of Biblical references in the first episode on Mesopotamia.  To me the approach of the series was quite understandable.  The Bible is one of the most ancient and reliable sources of information in addition to being a cultural reference point that many viewers would naturally reflect upon.

But by no means is the series an unscientific propaganda piece for religous groups.  Religion is not the focus of the series.  Consider, for example, that several episodes do not hesitate to make a comment on the sexual practices of the culture under discussion when relevant.

The series does not confine its self to ""Lost"" civilizations, so I suspect the title was more a product of the marketing department.  But the episode on the Agean Sea culture (Atlantis?) was quite interesting.  The episode on the lost history of Africa is something one does not hear much about. The sheer breadth and variety of cultures discussed makes this a valuable general introductory tool.",1139097600,56,1271,4.892523364485982
1784275,5,B00006L942,"When I first saw the name Time-Life I was anticipating a cesspool of political correct hodgepodge. As a public school teacher I was thrilled to find the straight forward format for this production. National Geographic could take some lessons from Time-Life's Lost Civilizations. The viewer will walk away with a ton of well researched info that is very professionally produced. An expansion into India, China, Australia,  Russia, and Japan would be super. Keep up the good work.",1128988800,25,478,5.207792207792208

7971246,5,B00006L942,"I bought the VHS tapes of this wonderful series years ago and liked it so much that I'm purchasing the DVD of this magnificent documentary of historical civilizations. This series is very informative, interesting, and with Sam Waterston narrating how could you go wrong. This series is a must for ancient history enthusiasts.",1435536000,,325,5.150943396226415
7971247,5,B00006L942,I especially like the ones on the Ancient Near East and on Egypt that have an interesting blend of archaeological or historic information with memorable recreations of events.,1431561600,,175,5.285714285714286
7971248,4,B00006L942,Purchased for my Father. He said it was good but too theatrical and not as factual as others.,1421884800,,93,4.222222222222222
7971249,2,B00006L942,"I purchased this documentary series primarily for the episode on Mesopotamia.  Unfortunately, the scholarship here is absent.  Time Life's Mesopotamia isn't based on a modern understanding of the history of Mesopotamia.  Instead, the documentary is based on a Christian and Biblical based view of Mesopotamia.  It barely mentions the ancient civilizations the documentary should be about (Sumer, Assyria, and Babylon) as a backdrop to stories and quotations from the Bible.  In reality, this particular documentary is mostly an effort to give historicity to the Bible.  Since physical evidence doesn't exist for the bible's historical accuracy, they rely heavily of anecdotal stories--some of which were possibly deceptions.

If you are looking for an actual historical documentary on Ancient Sumer, find the 2007 SBS Documentary narrated by Simon Chilvers which is titled: Civilisations: The Gardens of Babel.",1415836800,5,910,5.696296296296296

This series tries to make the ancient civilizations more exciting by slipping in sexual references every so often.",1396224000,,293,4.745098039215686
