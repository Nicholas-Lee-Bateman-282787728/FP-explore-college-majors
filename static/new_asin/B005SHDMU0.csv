Starring Butch Patrick of Eddie Munster fame, you will love it! The extras on the disc are pretty amusing, also. Pick up a copy while you can!!!",1324857600,,294,4.784313725490196
8485035,5,B005SHDMU0,"I'm not really sure what was expected by the bad reviewer, but if you want a perfect song and video for halloween then this is it. then tie in that it's Butch Patrick from tv's Munsters and it's like worth so much more. It's creepy, spooky and mysteriously hookie. i loved it, played with all my other halloween music and had a great night. there is not much out there in the way of new halloween music 0 this is a perfect fit.",1320451200,,427,4.156626506024097

8485037,1,B005SHDMU0,It's Only Halloween is not woth the money when I purchased it the min time said 4 min then after I ordered it min time changed to 12 min well I thought that was a mistake since the time of the dvd kept changing well I was wrong it is only like 12 min didn't time it but I'm sure that is about correct here I thought it was a mistake mistake on my part it's not a video it's just halloween singing I guess they call it a musical I call it corney I thought it was a movie not a musical I grew up with Butch Patrik so I really wanted this for my dvd collection thinking it was a movie with him starring in it a waste of 9.99 the details of this is very poor they don't explain rather it's a movie or as they put it a musical rather cheesy I wanted to like it for Butch Patrik but not even for him is it worth it.,1320105600,,809,3.7093023255813953
