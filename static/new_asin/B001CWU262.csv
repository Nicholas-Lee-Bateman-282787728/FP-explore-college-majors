3520403,1,B001CWU262,"My boyfriend and I tried to watch this and didn't make it more than 10 minutes into the video. There is a huge market for dad-to-be advice areas and we thought this would offer an uplifting view on the preparation of fatherhood and the beginning stages of being a dad. But it didn't. In fact, we were both so bored we turned it off. If we wanted to watch average guys tell their average stories about mundane daily events, we would walk down to the local coffee shop. But even there, we've found more inspirational stories on the joys of parenthood.

Great idea, but totally missed the mark.",1361404800,,591,4.472222222222222
3520404,5,B001CWU262,"My husband is a soon to be father for the first time.  We are the first of any of our friends to have kids, so he really has had no one to talk to about their experiences.  This video was a great way for him to hear some REAL perspectives of expecting fathers.",1342137600,,260,3.8867924528301887
3520405,5,B001CWU262,"My husband was terribly uninterested in every book and baby show I tried to get him to watch in the early months of pregnancy. (He was happy about the pregnancy but found all the informative things just plain boring).  I found this movie on Netflix and rented it with the hopes of drawing him in!

It TOTALLY did the trick!  He watched this show intently and laughed along with the guys in the movie.  It did a great job of giving a ""regular guy's"" perspective on pregnancy.  He actually asked if we could rent the follow up movie about bringing the baby home!  I was shocked - and very thankful to the creators of this movie!!",1266278400,,627,4.362068965517241
3520406,4,B001CWU262,"Loved it.  The only thing that would have helped to love it more was, sometimes, I did not understand what Troy was saying, or what he was referring to.  After watching it a few times, I could pick up what he said  or meant.",1260403200,,224,4.045454545454546
3520407,2,B001CWU262,"Bought it for my husband- He didn't like it at all- he wouldn't even wath the whole thing. Now to be honest my husband is picky, but I watch everything and I couldn't really find much value in this. it didn't grab my attention enough for me to keep watching. maybe it was great, but I couldn't watch it long enough to find out",1253836800,,326,4.109375
3520408,5,B001CWU262,I purchased this video for my husband for Christmas. We are trying to get pregnat this spring. We both enjoyed the video. I explored the emotional connection for the fathers as well as the physcical connection. It was so funny yet very informative. My husband loved it!,1233187200,,269,4.74468085106383
3520409,5,B001CWU262,"I wish this video were available while my wife was pregnant 2 years ago.  This movie is clearly by dads, for (soon-to-be) dads.  And yet Mom will be thrilled to see Dad glued to the screen next to her.

Mom: Buy this video for your man, make some popcorn, and trick him into watching it.  I was sucked in immediately myself, into the brotherhood of men discussing their experiences leading up to the births of their babies.  I laughed a lot, I learned a lot, and I even had a lump in my throat at times.  (You don't need to mention that part to your man.)

Dad: Picking up this video is an opportunity to score major points by showing how supportive you are during this new experience you're sharing.  You need to bank up some of these points now.  Trust me on this.

Friends & Family: Know that this video will serve as a great gift to both the soon-to-be Mom *and* Dad in your life.  My wife loved it regardless of its focus on Dads.  In fact, that made it more comical, plus she probably felt more at ease knowing that I wasn't disenfranchised (bored) watching your typical Mom-focused, more ""clinical"" video.",1222214400,3,1112,4.397058823529412
3520410,5,B001CWU262,"This movie shares all the facts of fatherhood in an informative yet playful format that makes us feel like we are part of the group of dads chatting with one another over a beer or two. A great preparation for becoming a first-time father and a trip down memory line for those who have already joined the fatherhood club (with lots of answers to those questions that even experienced dads have always been wondering about). While the general tone of the movie is light and humorous, these dads share their feelings from the heart and by including a wide variety of men from different parts of the country, the viewer gets a clear picture of the personal yet universal concerns and joys of becoming a father. Conversations between fathers are interspersed with brief explanations from various experts in the field. If it is ever truly possible to prepare for parenthood, ""Being Dad"" is an excellent first step in that preparation!",1221004800,2,929,4.8125
3520411,4,B001CWU262,"Everything we have seen about impending childbirth on film so far-- from ""Nine Months"" to ""Knocked Up""-- has focused on the mother's experience with the dad-to-be along for the ride, seemingly to only offer uneducated attempts at comedic relief for their stressed out better halves.  Snapper Lounge Media, PNM Productions, and Leslie Marsh have set out to rectify that now, though, with ""Being Dad,"" an eighty-minute journey of what the various stages of pregnancy are like for the men ""behind the scenes,"" so to speak.  In some very real and very touchingly honest discussions with dads from all across the United States, ""Being Dad"" is one part informative educational tool and one part sentimental documentary.

""Being Dad"" opens on Troy, a young man who's expecting his first child.  Though the first minute or so tells us that Troy only has twelve hours until his baby is born, the film then backtracks through time to explore his nine-month journey.  Footage of Troy attending to cravings, doctors appointments, Lamaze classes, and nursery preparations is few and far between, though, and mostly entails Troy talking directly to the camera about something his off-screen wife has said.  Marsh, then, relies on a healthy combination of interviews with medical professionals as well as a random combination of strangers to cover a wide variety of possible experiences or any first time father.

Men from all over the country-- California, New York, Chicago, Boston-- were interviewed on-camera in ""Being Dad,"" presumably to give their words a universal appeal.  Since we only meet them after the fact, and we never see them interact with either a pregnant wife or a baby, it's easy to put their words and stories onto just about anyone: they could be our brothers, our neighbors, our co-workers, or our old college buddies.  Sitting around, drinking some beers and sharing their stories, they are snappy and exceptionally comfortable, despite the intimate nature of what they are saying, and that, in turn, is refreshing.  Through these guys, ""Being Dad"" seems to become much more about these nameless ""everyman"" dads than Troy.  Though there is a brief moment in the very first restaurant that we see Troy sitting at the table and laughing, too, Marsh then quickly opts for close-ups of the men talking rather than reaction shots of the man for whom everything is about to change.  Getting in so close on these expressive faces just makes the viewing experience that much more emotional and investing, as well, and though instead of identifying only with Troy, we end up losing ourselves in recollections about pregnancy tests, morning sickness, miscarriages, and much, much more.  Being Dad suddenly becomes everyone's story, and opening it up in such a way not only makes it more accessible but also more relatable.

Marsh uses title cards to separate her ""chapters"" of ""Being Dad"" in the most blatant way to tell the audience what to expect next, which is almost poetic in that we are so prepared when the dads were so completely blindsided just months earlier.  ""Being Dad"" is a somewhat unexpectedly sentimental look at fatherhood, but a word to the wise that it may not be for the skittish dads, as when we finally rejoin Troy, he is in the delivery room about to meet his baby for the first time, and just as all of the men were completely candid in their discussions, the camera is completely candid in what it shows.  And really, in those moments, Being Dad's cinematography acts almost as a metaphor for its general message: just when you think you're getting comfortable, something throws you for a complete loop.  And really, that's fatherhood in a nutshell.",1217289600,6,3675,4.978758169934641
8290256,4,B001CWU262,Great perspective for dads and moms alike.,1461024000,,42,5.142857142857143
8290257,5,B001CWU262,Pretty funny. Husband laughed and we definitely related to things being discussed. Looks homemade/low budget because I'm sure it was but that didn't take away from the film.,1447632000,,173,5.214285714285714
8290258,5,B001CWU262,"Great documentary exploring the pregnancy process from finding out through delivery; from a guys perspective. As mentioned it the movie, there are plenty of resources and groups for women, but very little for men.",1446768000,,213,5.294117647058823
8290259,5,B001CWU262,"cool documentary.  As a husband of a 8 month pregnant wife, I found this documentary very relatable.",1441238400,,100,4.882352941176471
8290260,3,B001CWU262,"I don't have a better video to recommend. It's depressing, because the real dad will probably not be as enthusiastic as the movie dads... I like that they show the baby with the ""cheese""...",1436227200,,189,4.588235294117647
8290261,5,B001CWU262,My gentlemen was really having a hard time with our first pregnancy he found a lot of comfort in this documentary I highly recommend it for all soon to be fathers!!,1418428800,,164,4.32258064516129

8290263,2,B001CWU262,"I watched this with my husband and he gave it a score of 2 out of 10.  Not very helpful to hear other dad's subjective thoughts and feelings in terms of preparing for birth.  I think we had the expectation that this would replace the need for reading some birth / delivery dad books, but it did not contain that type of helpful information.",1396137600,,340,4.296875
8290264,3,B001CWU262,"Cute movie, but generic. I had trouble understanding the main characters English/British accent at first. I pass this along to friends that are expecting along with Being Dad 2 and never have had any comments back, good/bad. This one is better than Being Dad 2 in my opinion. If daddy to be has a lot of friends with kids then that is probably good enough. No need to buy this video to get more advice.",1362787200,,402,4.373333333333333
8290265,4,B001CWU262,"A good one-time watch. I didn't feel that it contained any information you couldn't get from talking to close friends or family who already have kids. Although, it was funny and entertaining so if you are looking to watch it only once I would definitely say buy it.",1362528000,,265,4.541666666666667
