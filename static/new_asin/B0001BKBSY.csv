1986266,1,B0001BKBSY,Cannot give a review because I couldn't play the damn thing on any DVD player I have. Purchase was a wash.,1397779200,,106,4.095238095238095
1986267,1,B0001BKBSY,"I could not open the product. I got a message on screen that said "" Disc Error-- Playback feature may not be available on this disc"" So I sent it back with a note about the problem and ask for a replacement. I got the replacement but it did the same thing. Not sure what was wrong. I tried to open on two different DVD players and laptop and never could open. I am disappointed as I really wanted this game. Apparently no one in the supply chain or the producer of the CD could solve the problem but they did refund my money. I would have preferred a good copy of the game.",1397520000,,573,4.035087719298246
1986268,5,B0001BKBSY,This was one of my favorite OU games of all time. It was purely a defensive game that reminds me of what OU lacks nowadays. If only we could get back to more physical defenses:-(,1374537600,,178,4.114285714285714
1986269,5,B0001BKBSY,"SPOILER:  OU beat Florida State 13-2.  If you liked watching the game on ABC, this is exactly that.",1133654400,4,99,4.444444444444445
8009688,1,B0001BKBSY,I don't understand if so many people are having trouble with this DVD playing Amazon should take it off and not try to sell it I bought this DVD three times and the last two would not play I bought this DVD a couple years ago and it played fine must be bad disks,1515456000,,262,3.8703703703703702
8009689,5,B0001BKBSY,If you're a Sooner fan like me.,1458345600,,31,3.5714285714285716
8009690,1,B0001BKBSY,I ordered this & it didn't work. I received a replacement & it didn't work either. :(,1440374400,,85,4.0588235294117645
8009691,1,B0001BKBSY,"Disc is garbage just like everybody says. It will not play on DVD, Blu-ray or computer. My Panasonic Blu-ray player is very forgiving. It will play just about anything. I bought a Private Ryan Blu-ray disc that Amazon recalled and issued replacements for. Never had to do that. My Blu-ray played it with no problem at all. Plugged this disc in and got ""NO READ"" message. Never ever have I had that before on any disc and I have a lot. These people at DVD Marketing Inc. should be ashamed themselves for putting this out, not pulling it and re-issuing a disc that actually works. I'm not even going to return it. I'm just running it through the shredder.",1425686400,,653,4.495798319327731
8009692,1,B0001BKBSY,"Would not play in 4 DVD players, Amazon sent another for free , same problem!!!!",1407110400,,80,4.4

8009694,1,B0001BKBSY,"I bought this DVD for myself and my son.  Neither side would play.  We exchanged them for 2 more.  They didn't work.  Again, we exchanged them for a third time, and you guessed it, they didn't work.  Absolutely unbelievable, 6 DVD' s, all of them crap.",1400371200,,252,4.391304347826087
8009695,1,B0001BKBSY,"Someone in quality control is not doing their job. Tried both disks I ordered on a blueray a regular DVD and my computer. I really want this disk but would want some assurance that someone verified that the disk was in working order.

My first negative Amazon experience.",1399852800,,271,4.645833333333333
8009696,2,B0001BKBSY,"Does not play on Samsung Blu Ray or Panasonic DVD players. Received messages of ""Disc will not load"" and ""Incompatible Disc"".  I originally thought the disc was damaged however it was replaced and the same problem occurred again.  Disappointing.",1399507200,,245,5.256410256410256
8009697,2,B0001BKBSY,"DVD appeared new and undamaged. When trying to play DVD, the message. -
""Not formatted for playback"" , appeared.
A second DVD (2014 Sugar Bowl) from this same seller played fine.
When I Emailed the seller (thru Amazon), explaining the problem, I expected a quick response saying that a pretested replacement DVD and a return envelope for the defective DVD were on the way- case closed-customer happy. But no !
Over a week later - no response! I finally went back to Amazon and received a refund for the DVD and postage for the defective item. So the bottom line is -
Regardless of vendor  problems - Amazon makes it right.",1399248000,,622,4.603603603603603
