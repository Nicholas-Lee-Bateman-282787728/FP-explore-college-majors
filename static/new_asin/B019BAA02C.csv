8744590,4,B019BAA02C,"I'm surprised no one else has reviewed this great DVD yet. With that said, let me tell you that this is one barre workout worth its weight in gold! Colleen is very upbeat and thorough in her explanation of the techniques. The format is as follows:
1) Warm-up
2) Upper body toning using weights-(3-10 lbs.), depending on your fitness level, of course.
3) Barre workout-Colleen uses a portable ballet barre here, but she says you can use a high-back chair as a substitute. You also use a Pilates Band.
4) Floor Barre workout(abs & triceps)
5) Cool-down
6)Bonus section workout using the Beyond Barre Gildeboard(which you can purchase through her website for $250).

Overall, I was impressed with how well the workout flowed. You get a great workout and break a sweat, no problem. It's rated as an intermediate-level workout, which is right. This is not a beginner-level workout. It's perhaps for the advanced Beginner, maybe, but definitely not for someone just starting out. The two reasons I can't give this video 5-stars is because: 1) It would have been nice if Colleen had another person doing the workout using a chair. 2) I feel that Colleen should offer a separate workout DVD using ONLY the Gildeboard. And let's face it: $250 for the Glideboard and a couple hundred dollars for a portable ballet barre(depending on where you buy it) is not an easy pill to swallow. Those two things are mainly the reason why I can't give this DVD 5 stars.",1513814400,,1446,4.738095238095238
