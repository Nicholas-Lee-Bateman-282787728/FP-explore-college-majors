8584470,3,B000EMGF58,"This was okay but for $17-18, it is over-priced. I used to have a VHS copy of the original ""Giants of Brazil"" which probably came out in the 70s/80s. It covered Brazil's World Cup campaigns from 1950 through 1970 but was much more comprehensive and had goals and highlights from every match Brazil played in most of those World Cups. This DVD on the other hand has 55 minutes in which they squeeze 1950-1994 so there are a few goals here and there...for instance, in the 1970 World Cup, they show goals from 3 games including the Final. The 1958 World Cup segment only has footage from the final. It's still a good quick summary of Brazil's World Cup history but this is more of a teaser than anything else. You cannot possibly compile all those World Cup highlights into a 55 minute video.",1323475200,2,790,4.493055555555555
