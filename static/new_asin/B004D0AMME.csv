8424602,5,B004D0AMME,"this is a great movie that really makes you think. its a somewhat terrifying idea of what the future could hold, but it has definitely found its way to my heart and i recommend it to absolutely everyone.",1362787200,2,203,4.368421052631579
8424603,5,B004D0AMME,"Nice futuristic indie. Found this online and took a shot. Good production values, killer premise, and a tight script make for a nice Phillip K. Dick inspired trip (emphasis on word trip.) Dystopian futuristic films are not my thing, but this works beyond the genre. Donnie Darko is definitely an influence in there somehow, so if you want that type of experience give it a shot. You come away wondering what world our children will be suffering through in less time than we might imagine. Bleak, ambitious, thought provoking film...",1305244800,3,532,4.9222222222222225
8424604,5,B004D0AMME,Okay I did not know more about this movie then the movie trailer and what I had read about it on facebook. Of course the fact that my favourite actor David Thornton is in it and that it is an independent movie helped the purchase decision greatly. I could not wait to receive the movie having pre ordered it I thought it sounded good. Nothing prepared me for the movie I was about to see it was a futuristic thriller and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I never knew what would be around the corner and when I tried to guess I found myself wrong and I love that in a movie. I can not believe that this movie is an independent movie it certainly holds its own compared to anything big time studios have graced us with lately. The casting is superb and David Thornton as the excentric milionare brings mean and evil to an entirely new level. A must see for any serious fan of futuristic suspense thrillers in my book well worth its price.,1301097600,3,951,4.202185792349726
