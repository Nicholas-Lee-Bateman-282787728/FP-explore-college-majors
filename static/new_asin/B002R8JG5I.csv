Granted, traveling the universe in a wormhole is fantasy, but it were possible, this is how it would be.  I also love the pacing of the series.  We're getting to know the characters, the ship, and the situation our crew is in.  As they discover things, so do we.  The absence of Star Trek type rubber faced aliens is also a plus.  I will always love the original SG-1 team.  They are the best.  However, I am really enjoying the crew of the ancient spaceship Destiny and hope their journey back to Earth takes a few more years.",1259971200,5,696,4.4523809523809526
3971496,1,B002R8JG5I,"I have always been a die hard Stargate fan, however, I have found that Stargate Universe is a big letdown. They have taken a great series of shows and created a whole new version of an unrelated series. It's a shame. As for the half season, I too would not purchase it. As with the Wild Wild West (way overpriced per season) I will wait for the full series. I got the WWW at $57 for the whole series, instead of paying $44 per season. I will do the same with other half season series as well. This new Stargate,  I would not buy at any price though, it's just not worth the ever diminishing space in my collection.

3971497,1,B002R8JG5I,I'm absolutely sick and tired of Syfy releasing their shows in half season sets.  I thought they would have learned their lesson with BSG; apparently not.  I have always been one of the first to purchase Stargate series DVDs/Blu Rays but I'm going to have to pass on this.  Hopefully they release the entire first season in one box set...otherwise I'll be waitin until a full series set comes out after the show is finished.,1259884800,56,424,4.626666666666667
3971498,3,B002R8JG5I,"I really like the show itself. It brings again old Stargate starches like the unknown and discovery. But no matter how good the show is, it doesn't deserve to get split up into two parts per season. The statement, they like to include more special content than usual won't work for me. They could have either added 1-2 additional disks into one dvd-box or used the full capacity of the Blu-Ray medium.

If you like the show and also like to have the DVDs/Blu-Ray, i suggest to wait how long the show will run. SG-1 had a collectors box, SG-Atlantis is releasing one now, and SGU probably will have one too if it runs a few seasons.",1259884800,,631,4.3931623931623935
3971499,1,B002R8JG5I,"I'm a fan of Stargate, Lost and BSG. And one wonders why I hate SGU so much? It's because it looks as good as Stargate, Lost and BSG. But it feels like something you won't like to take in your hands, because it's soft, warm and brown. And if television could smell, it would surely smell like it too.

The concept of Stargate Universe let's me doubt the sanity of the producers. How can they do a boring series like that? I simply can't understand that people earn money for such a waste of time. This is simply bad writing. But I know the writers are not the one's who are to blame. I know, they can do better! It's R.C. Cooper and B. Wright who are responsible for that... bah, I can't use the word! It's disgusting!

Go and watch the worst episodes of the series I mentioned above and you'll see what you get in SGU.

But to be fair... If you like daily soaps without thrilling stories, go and buy this series! You'll like it. It's really worth your money.",1259884800,7,959,4.229508196721311

3971501,1,B002R8JG5I,Comment: This series sucks so bad they had to take the original premier and the second episode and re-edit them to make episode three. Some fans hate it so much they won't allow it to be part of the Stargate series. This is what happens when they forget that this is a science fiction series and not a soap opera or hospital show. All the characters do is go back to earth and bitch... then come back to the ship and do more bitching among themselves. Don't waste your time getting into this series... it just smells (of dead rotting fish).,1259452800,12,540,4.356435643564357

There has been a lot of buzz around Stargate Universe. Some really like it, some really really hate it. I'm one of those people who has been really enjoying the show. Some say it's too slow, which is understandable. Not alot has happened in the 9 episodes that have aired. But other than that, I think the show has been pretty enjoyable so far.

Extras for the recently announced Blu-Ray will include the Behind the scenes videos that have been avalible on SGU's website as well as audio commentaries for all 9 episodes. [...].

Now my major problem with this: Not only are they splitting the season up into two parts, but for only nine episodes, it carries a ridiculously high price point. I could understand the [...] price tag if it was for the whole season, but not for nine episodes. For three or four dollars less, I can get 24 episodes of 24's seventh season, and that's on Blu-Ray too. I really wish MGM would come to their senses.",1259193600,44,1124,5.268156424581005

3971507,3,B002R8JG5I,"I won't  comment on the half-season fiasco because everyone else has done so.

I will comment on the disjointed aspect of the show -- the poor continuity or poor editing. The crew lost in space on an alien vessel has a way of visiting earth in the bodies of other people by playing with some blue stones. When Chloe first visits her mother, this is not clear what she is doing or how she is doing it. Later, when it does become clear, it is somewhat clever but weakly handled. The only clever aspect is when the Lou Diamond Philips character ends up in bed with the Colonel Young's wife who is screwing his brains out. Later, he pays visits to the wife to try to become her ""friend."" Of course, Captain Young finds out and beats the s---- out of him.

Biggest complaint - Chloe dies in one segment after a tearful good-bye by Eli and the blonde doctor (TJ?) However, she shows up in the next segment in perfect health as if nothing had happened. Huh? Either this was some sloppy continuity, or the segments were not properly installed onto the 3 disks.

I agree with other reviewers that sloppiness seems to be the byword for this series -- or at least in this HALF season. Maybe we should call this half-assed season.",1430611200,,1218,4.4

3971515,5,B002R8JG5I,"The five-star rating is for the series, and not the half-season DVD set. It's true, SGU took a lot of inspiration from the excellent reboot of Battlestar Galactica, taking the much-loved and very entertaining Stargate franchise into more serious dramatic territory. They did away with the cheesy, English-speaking alien bad guys like the Goa'uld, the Wraith, and the Ori (who were the terrible replacement villains late in SG-1), and gave us alien planets that were a bit more alien, instead of worlds that were identical to the forests of British Columbia. They switched to hand-held cameras and documentary-type cinematography, with dark, gritty sets and muted lighting appropriate for the ancient, city-sized spaceship the series was set in. Personally, I loved this series, and I was one of the viewers who was upset when Stargate: Atlantis was cancelled, presumably to make room for SGU. Robert Carlyle, the brilliant Scottish actor from 28 Weeks Later, The Full Monty, and of course, Trainspotting -- his portrayal as the psychopathic Begbie is one of my all-time favorite performances -- took the role of Dr. Nicholas Rush, the man responsible for discovering the 'Destiny' on it's course to the edge of the universe. He does an excellent job as the utterly driven scientist who no one on board trusts, and many blame for their predicament. But the person who solved the mathematical riddle that brought them to Destiny was not Rush, but Eli Wallace, a shiftless young genius with an ailing mother. He is recruited after solving a series of complex equations planted in an online video game by the US Military, and within hours he has unlocked the code Rush and his team have spent months working on. An attack on the off-world base where the Stargate capable of reaching Destiny is located results in an emergency evacuation; the gate address is not Earth's, but the ancient starcraft, and a large group made up of military personnel, scientists, and politicians find themselves trapped, millions of light years from home. The ranking officer who takes charge of the situation, Colonel Young, immediately butts heads with Rush, and a struggle of wills begins that eventually erupts in violence. While his priority is finding a way home, it is clear Rush has other ambitions, and Young comes to rely on Eli Wallace as the only other person on Destiny capable of understanding the ships complicated operating system.

I actually liked SGU better than Battlestar Galactica, which had an excellent first and second season, but lost track of its many storylines in season three. The series became mired in a strange pseudo-Christian mysticism that related to the history of the BSG worlds destroyed by the Cylons, which together made up a futuristic Roman Empire, complete with worship of the Greco-Roman pantheon. The Cylons, now essentially human, were mono-theistic zealots who correlated with the rise of Christianity that sealed Rome's downfall. SGU had its own semi-religious sub-plot, relating to a recording that isolated a pattern in the 'noise' of the Big Bang. But it was more concerned with providing viewers with an engaging story and interesting characters, and didn't start taking itself too seriously, as BSG did.

The BSG inspiration went too far when the decision was made to package the DVD release of the series the same way BSG had, dividing the season into two 10-episode installments labelled 'Season 1.0' and 'Season 1.5'. The move had annoyed the hell out of me when BSG did it, but when SGU tried the exact same gambit, it was just sad. I knew that the future of the series was going to be decided by how well it sold on DVD. By rushing in to a half-season release and charging the same amount as a full-season collection, they ensured that SGU's more savvy fan-base would reject the blatant cash-grab. Thus, the show was doomed. With Season 3 cancelled, Season 2 ended on a cliff-hanger, and the series was to be concluded with a straight-to-DVD movie. After scheduling conflicts delayed production, the movie was cancelled as well. A sad end for what was an excellent series, regardless of the quick dismissals claiming it was nothing more than a cynical attempt to replicate a better series. It had thoughtful, exciting stories, fascinating characters, and a great cast, which is far more than 99% of the current crop can boast.",1406160000,2,4360,5.0041322314049586

This is a show for adults looking for a stronger writing style though its from the same writers.

Season two definately pick up when the Alucian aliance and the Aliens was introduced, more interesting was when they introduced the drones and that higher intelligence were against any technology they encountered and the drones were on a mission to try and destroy the SGU completely due to the Ancients higher technology.

3971524,5,B002R8JG5I,"Yes, yes. Most people despised Stargate Universe. It's too much like Battlestar Galactica in it's edgy tension and constant conflict within the core group for Stargate fans but it's too much like Stargate for the Battlestar fans. Either too tame or not tame enough. For some of us, the balance was perfect. It was a Stargate show that used the best of the show's unique technology and alien races, while focusing almost entirely on character-driven storylines. A few of the episodes are a little slow going in as characters are developed and like all shows, some of the episodes are just not good but by far the majority are excellent, if the formula works for you. The acting is incredible and every single actor, be it lead, second string or guest star, holds up their end of some interesting writing. The characters are all flawed, some are unlikeable but complex and understandable and they all make mistakes at some point; in that, they come across as real people. You aren't always proud of your heroes and you can't always fault the bad guys. One caveat: they're big on cliffhanger endings, especially over the season break so if you find yourself hooked on season one, try to have season two lined up before you watch the finale.

As for the Blu-ray set itself, it includes all the many extras the DVD sets have and a few more. There are cast interviews, commentaries on every single show, specials and the entire collection of Kino Diaries that were on the net during the show's run are here.",1338595200,4,1501,4.6856060606060606

This however is the start of the show and I do agree that splitting a season into two blu ray editions is just  too expensive. However they hadn't shown all the eps when they came out with 1.0 so there you go. I am glad I stuck with the show because it just got better and more engaging, the stories impoved, the actors got more comfortable , the direction of the show was more clear.  Give this show a chance , however these early eps are not the highlight of this show , they are crap either imo, just part of a show trying to find itself.  the blu ray looks great and that makes it easier to take as well.",1290556800,,745,4.124137931034483

3971529,5,B002R8JG5I,"This show is fantastic! This show is definitely a significant step in the evolution of the modern science fiction TV show - not as big of a step as BSG, but a big step nonetheless. This show has the best acting, visual effects, continuity and general quality of any show on television right now.

Air - Great pilot. Introduced as many characters as it can very well. Only things I don't like are Elyse Levesque's acting and general character - she really, really annoyed me in this episode and her scenes after her father dies generally make me wanna gag. I also think the pilot would have been better if it was told chronologically rather than using flashbacks. 4/5
Darkness - Really great dramatic episode even better than the pilot. 5/5
Light - Even better than Darkness, and a great conclusion to this two-parter. The visual effects and score in this one are jaw-dropping and all of my friends who watched this were blown away by this episode. Aside from the predictable ""getting energy from the sun"", flawless.
Water - Decent stand-alone. Dialogue between Young and Scott is pretty funny, but this is probably the most boring of this half of season one. Not a huge fan of Carl Binder's episodes in this show. 4/5
Earth - There is a scene in this episode which is...well, completely hilarious but sick at the same time. Always a pleasure to see SG-1 star Richard Dean Anderson to pass on the torch. 5/5
Time - Unbelievably good. Possibly the best episode of Stargate ever. If you're showing this show to your friends, show 'em this one. 10/5
Life - This episode can be a huge turn off for a lot of viewers, as the characters use the Ancient communication stones to visit Earth (again). But I personally like this episode. Love the montages at the beginning and end using the same song showing the monotony of the crew's life in space. 5/5
Justice - Excellent episode that seemed to get more viewers on board with the show that were previously on the edge. A compelling mystery story that comes to a head at the end of the episode and leaves the audience with a shocking cliffhanger.

Is it a slow show? Sure, and that's what I like about it, after seeing SGA's terrible series finale ""Enemy at the Gate"" that was so rushed that scenes that could have been spread out over an entire episode were scrunched in between dialogue scenes and never seen. This first half of season one sets up the characters. 1.5 is where the pace really picks up - but not on the level of EatG. This show is great and really needs to be supported.

SG-1 was very good but it was a show that was very much in the wilderness when it comes to establishing who the characters are with both the good guys and the bad guys and the lore. I loved the journey SG-1 took me on and I own all 10 seasons as we speak.

SGA was more of a continuation of SG-1 but with far fewer ""bottle episodes""! SGA did have a clear arc but it just didn't have the staying power that SG-1 had, I think, because of the multiple changes of the lead character. They went through 3 different people! That's like taking Picard off the Enterprise then go to Riker,then go to someone you barely know! That's crazy. Imagine Edward J. Olmos being killed on Battlestar Galactica. Dont get me wrong here. I also own all 5 seasons of SGA and I love it too.

SGU is a blessing from the gods but Stargate had to change! If they ran another show like SGA and SG-1 the show may not have gotten past the pilot. People stopped watching remember? It would make no sense to redo the same format all over again. The ""new"" way of doing things on SGU is the absolute best way to go and if you don't watch you are just nuts.

The Writers of this show managed to introduce new characters with plots that have enough twists, turns and intelligent dialog to keep me interested and coming back for more. I have no doubt this could have gone on for many more seasons, assuming the writing remained challenging.

Interestingly, any lack of viewer following maybe due to a lack of promotion. Frankly, I just stumbled onto the show as it was closing. Luckily DVD's are available and I gobbled up the entire series with a ravenous appetite and now I am hungry for more.",1283731200,3,940,4.562130177514793

I was very hopeful when I first heard about the new series - although there were elements of the previous shows that I was not fond of, as a rule they were exceptional. I expected the same from SGU and it was a mistake.

It is difficult to get enthused about a show when you despise virtually all of the characters. Maybe one or two, that I can understand. But all of them? I can't necessarily blame the actors as I expect they are hostage to the script and director. This show has a group of the nastiest, most self involved characters I've seen outside a ""reality"" tv show. Petty, backstabbing behavior, chronic lies and betrayal seems to be standard with this group. These are just not nice people.

There is none of the humor or ""team spirit"" the prior shows were known for. The SGU characters are all about ""me me me"".  SG1 and Atlantis characters were all about doing what is right. SG1 and Atlantis always had hope underlying the drama. Granted, the lightning in a bottle chemistry that was SG1 doesn't happen easily or frequently, and I didn't set the bar that high for this series and it still fell WAY short.

In the case of both SG1 and Atlantis the characters all struck me as being people I would want to know - people you would want to ""have your back"" in a bad situation. The cast of SGU makes me want to run in the other direction figuring it is better to face the danger alone than with them at your back.

The story ideas have been creative, but without the positive feel to them in the implementation. I can't work up any emotional investment in their well being, so the ""dangers"" have a very disconnected feel to them. I just can't get engaged in what is happening when they are running out of air, water, etc because I just don't care. It just isn't worth watching when you are just disgusted most of the time.  I've given up watching. I prefer to re-watch SG1 or Atlantis.

Now, regarding the half series DVD release nonsense. Syfy doesn't seem to care much about their fan base since this isn't the first time they ahve done this... I think it is shoddy and money grabbing with no consideration for the fans - particularly if it isn't obvious that it is only half the season. I guess they don't care if they alienate their fan base.",1281484800,10,2393,4.349775784753363
3971537,2,B002R8JG5I,"Being a Stargate fan since the first season of SG-1, I've found the first half season of Universe to be less than appealing for several reasons.  Most of the stories unfold far too slowly.  The atmosphere of the show goes beyond ""dark,"" gearing more toward dreary and mundane, with plodding human interest pieces which belong on daytime drama (aka soap operas).  The sex scenes sprinkled throughout the series often do little to advance the plot, and only serve to smut things up.  On top of all that, the music sucks.

To summarize, this is not the kind of show fans came to know and love in SG-1 and Atlantis.  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, time will tell, but personally I'm not enjoying the change.  I really hope things improve with the second half of the season, or I'm afraid this will be Stargate's swan song before too long.

My rating has nothing to do with the ""half season rip-off"" some other people have posted.  It is based solely on the quality of the episodes.",1281312000,5,990,4.51685393258427
3971538,5,B002R8JG5I,"I am a big fan of the first two Stargates.  As I found out that Atlantis was being cancelled and this one created, I rebelled and got tired of getting used to new crews, so I did not watch it, until I finally was bored one Friday night, feeling nostalgic for my favorite Friday night show.  I could always count on a good laugh for the week with Atlantis, and some great action.  What I missed in Atlantis and SG-1 is right on track with Universe...real characters that have a life that goes one or two steps further than the heroic characters of the first two series.  What I can say is that while I was a fan of Atlantis, I did not purchase that series because it wasn't something I would be interested in seeing for a while.  I do own the SG-1 series but find I only have a very few favorite episodes.  I did not hesitate to purchase this series because even though it can be a bit dark souled and too oppositional, the characters are engaging and never boring.  I'm hoping it will evolve into some lighter episodes and more scenes to refresh this audience like McKay was on Atlantis and ONeil and the others on SG-1.  Carlyle is a force to behold and Ferreira is a good match.  I feel like the creators were reading my mind in wanting a SG with some depth of character and I saw on interviews that it was on their mind too..  Lou Diamond Phillips is never better and looking over the cast they chose in the beginning, I thought, I'm not interested in watching these actors..but I was wrong and I've enjoyed the entire cast.  The women have some soul and are rounded out with lives and feelings and so are the men.  I look forward to the new episodes and am thankful the creators took the time to choose a cast that had such long term appeal, or do they have long term appeal because they have more to express?  Which ever it is, I''ll be there on whatever night they show up.  One note on DVD quality..mine(1.0) skips, so whether that is due to the low price at Amazon or not, can't say..I purchased 1.5 locally so I could take it back if necessary.

The dialogue is bare with un-needed discriptions of human relations rather than about the Wrath, or the Replicators etc. Gone are fun missions on faraway planets, gone are badgering between Carter and the Colonel, or Carter and McKay. To be fair, the show isn't all that bad. It's just that this series should NOT have the title Stargate attached to it. The Atlantis series did SG-1 a great service to the series and brought with it all of the expectations any Stargate fan might have. So for your own benefit, if you do choose to take a gander at SG Universe, try to forget any ties to the original SG series, and who knows, you might like it. I didn't, but I had my SG expectations.",1279584000,3,787,4.43448275862069
3971541,1,B002R8JG5I,"This show is terrible. It has bad plots, almost no action in it at all, and for the most part bad actors and bad charactors. The pilot was the worst episode of all. It's a three-hour episode that has only 5-minutes of action in it, the majority of the episode (as with the series) is about people arguing with each other, and the story keeps jumping back and forth from past to present events. The other episodes are a step-up from the pilot, but still are lacking a great deal. And I don't know why so much controversy is made over the nude scene in ""Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods"" when this whole ""Stargate Universe"" show seems to be focused on sex.

Not recommended!",1279497600,7,675,4.4
3971542,4,B002R8JG5I,"I'm not entirely sure why they would release only half the season on DVD... I suppose they could have been trying to get more viewers to bolster ratings. The only reason I don't give the product 5 stars is because it is not a full season (which seems almost like cheating). The show itself I found to be riveting and an excellent off-shoot of the original.

Keep in mind, this is not very much like Stargate SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis. For me, that is a good thing, because although I loved the chemistry between the characters and the fact that we got to see a new planet almost every episode, I got a little tired of costumes that looked like plastic and nylon... and that all the aliens inexplicably spoke English, without even the cursory attempt to make these little details plausible (the exception to this description, by the way, is in seasons 9 & 10 from SG-1 where I felt they vastly improved in those departments). Stargate Universe is actually closer in tone and mood to the original movie from 1980 that spawned the first TV series, so if you liked that you will likely enjoy this series as well.

The defining nature of this series is that it is character driven. It treats all the characters as multi-dimensional, with the added benefit that they haven't manipulated the characters' actions to push a new angle on the story. It seems to be well thought out, as well. The story flows smoothly, and although surprising details sometimes emerge, they also seem plausible because they have been hinted at all along. The special effects have gotten better, and the grittiness serves to enhance the reality of their world... which was a canny choice given the appetites of modern audiences.

You may be able to tell by now that I prefer a certain amount of realism in my sci-fi (how is that for an oxymoron?). I don't tend to go for stories that cut corners with their characters or plot, especially since those writers will usually write themselves into a corner.  I detest the ones that sacrifice the artistic integrity of the narrative in favor of sensationalism and making a quick buck. With all of that in mind, let me say that I truly enjoy watching this series. It may not suit every taste, but I personally think it is the highest quality spin-off yet, and as such it suits me.",1278806400,6,2293,4.599022004889975

I delightedly recognized him from Day of the Dead, in which he became a zombie in the opening scenes.

Those reviewers who gave up after the first few episodes really missed a strong season.  It is not SG-1 or SGA, which is fine with me.  I loved those shows, and I hope another Stargate show comes along modeled after the style of those two.

I doubt there wil be anything more than 1 season and maybe one ending movie. The stars are deffinitly not the same do not not compare to the old cast from SG1 and Atlantis. Its not a bad show but I think the people who made this never even watched SG1 or Atlantis. Its crappy grafics, and more into blood and sex. Now i am all for blood and sex. Thats not the peoblem. The problem is no one acts the same as they did before. The IOA rep has a heart the lead scientist it a douch bag the Col has no balls and the LT is a wanna be priest who sleeps with all the girls on bored in broom closets and the doctor who is exspected to figure out all kinds of new and crazy alian midical issues is nothiing more than a medic who know jack. So when she does figure something out with all kinds of fancy tests, it is very disapointing. Who tougth her how to use all the equipment in teh first place? Good actrass though.

After watching the second show, you already know the story line. They need water, food, and cleaning suplies.

A couple short trips to Wallmart and they have what they need. Now what are they saposed to do? I am suprised that the former acters allowed this show to happen the way it did. They only have a few hours on ground. So little can happen. you knwo that if they don't get back on bored befcore hand they will get left. That makes it very easy to predict teh ending. There is some good drama in the, a few decent actores etc.

Its not a bad show, I will be buying the second part. I did give it 4 stars for a reason. But i would not concider it to be apart of the Star Gate family at all. Eevryone involved in making this show is completely off base. This is not the Jefersons. Well at least i thought it wasent. The music in the show is great music. But off base from the show. Even the ending part where it shows the ship. You have some gay little bubble ship taking off like you would see in a kids movie. The ship itself looks like it was disigned on a home coputer using paint.

The deal is not bad. You spend $20 bucks on a half season. Than you get a $10 check off SG1 or Atlantis. Not bad. But if you are a die hard fan, don't look at this show as part of the family. If you do, you won't like it. Completely forget SG1 and Atlantis.

3971564,5,B002R8JG5I,"I am a great fan of the original Stargate movie starring Kurt Russell and James Spader. When the original TV series started, I watched a few and then gave up because it lapsed into the ""alien of the week"" syndrome, epitomized in my childhood by the series, ""Lost in Space."" I would tune in periodically to see if anything changed, but it all looked like the same battle on a different (and cheap, reminiscent of Star Trek) set.

Then I chanced upon the premier of Stargate: Universe. I almost turned if off midway because of the typical battle with aliens, and then something wonderful happened: THE SHIP.

I am very impressed with the storyline and the production values of the series so far. The characters are multi-faceted and clearly defined. The scripting is intelligent and demands you pay attention -- you can't read the newspaper at the same time you're watching this one.

One reviewer complained about the communication stones. It is a very clever concept to drive character development and explain motivations from the characters' prior lives. And it was used marvelously at the beginning of the second half of the season to explain an alien encounter. (Rush has taken one of the stones surrepticiously before the box was opened for the first time, and had it on him when he was abandoned on the planet -- the aliens found it on him.)

I care about these characters more than I ever did any of the earlier Stargate TV series. There is NOT a preponderance of sex or nudity in this series. (I have no idea what kind of prude thinks there is. I wish there was more!) But in a confined environment where people may be trapped forever, it is not unlikely that multiple sexual unions would occur -- a classic SF novel by Poul Anderson --Tau Zero -- examines that very phenomenon.

The attempts by the characters to establish a civilian oversight of the military, the empathic abandonment of the damaged shuttle to the crew members staying to colonize one of the worlds they visit (all in the second half of the season, not on these DVDs of the first ten episodes) are real problems that real people would have to deal with.

I have watched this series on television (delay viewing with a DVR to avoid unwanted commercials). I will NOT buy these DVDs at this price -- I will wait until the full season is released before purchasing. But I could not let this fine series be maligned for a lack of quality.

3971569,5,B002R8JG5I,"I have read the reviews written on this site and do wonder if the people who are commenting actually know anything about Science Fiction the concept. There is little eye candy in SGU and a lot of human development that lacked in most of SG1 and SGA. The writers seem to be aiming for a combination of intelligence and entertainment, something like BSG meets Defying Gravity (a brilliant show)

I have followed studied and written SF since I was 16 and I will say SGU has and delivers an underlying cleverness that really does go over the head of couch potatos and slithering geekdom. I am not a fan of any series or die hard of TV at all, but I know when writers are trying harder and producers and directors go out of there way to use quality actors from the start rather than try and use guest spots to boost themselves.

Studying SF as a genre opens up insights that are sometimes quite profound - which will be seen in the second part of series one - the writers do need to be applauded for such deft touches while not breaking apart characters.

I absolutely disagree with current commentary shown in the list of reviews thus far...

Would these reviewers say StarTrek, and B5 were good? -- sad to say they were some of the worst SF moments in TV history. BSG set a new standard and SGU is thankfully aiming that high.

Good work... wait for the whole series and then watch it in a few sittings -- quite good, quite good indeed",1272326400,3,1432,4.368421052631579

It has had some low points just like any other show at this point in it's lifespan. This is not the original or even SGA, nor should it be! What killed Star Trek?? Churning the same old plots and human-like aliens in various forms through various spin-offs did! Now while I loved Star Trek and loved SGA (the original didn't do much for me) I don't want yet another rehash of the two prior shows. The characters in this show are flawed and complex! The episodes have plots that don't always include a big firefight with aliens. While I love a firefight as much as any other sci-fi loving man, it doesn't have to be featured in every episode. Season 1.5 seems to be picking up in speed and action, which I'm throughly enjoying thanks to character development in season 1.0!

Pros: -Complex characters who aren't pure good or pure evil! (my favorites are Young, Greer, and even Rush; my least fav is Chloe who seems to only serve the purpose of being hot).
-Excellent plots (having to scrounge for things such as water and parts for the air purifier were believable as scifi can get).
-The Destiny is a damned cool ship!

Cons: -The communication stones are a weak plot device and need to go!
-I agree with those that these half-seasons are getting old and are over-prised. However if you look at a movie being 2 hours and 20 bucks it seems a little better.",1271116800,6,1464,4.479400749063671

3971581,2,B002R8JG5I,"First off, I really like SGU as a show.  I am a fan of SG-1 and Atlantis, but I really like that this show is going in a different direction.  The very concept is interesting - a ship a couple of galaxies distant from our Milky Way that the Ancients sent out a million years ago that the gate system was able to jump to at a tremendous power expense.  A group of people are forced to go there (kinda) and they are stranded.  The ship can stop for brief times to help them find things they need as ships seeded planets with gates automatically ahead of this ship.

Some of the complaints I've seen I don't understand.  The stones used to communicate back to Earth have been around since season 9 of SG-1, so they are not a convenient invention to suit this show.  The writers don't really create anything new in the Stargate world to make this work.

Thus far there is no central villain race in this show like in so much sci-fi (like the Go'auld in SG-1 or the Ori in later SG-1, the Wraith in Atlantis, the Cylons in BSG, etc).  It is very much character driven and I find it interesting, especially once it hits its stride later in the first half of the season.

So why two stars?  Well, I'd give the show FOUR, but this set is a ZERO.  It is overpriced for even a full season and yet it is only half of one.  While the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is good, the menu is terrible.  The menu titles and the highlight color for selection are nearly the same.  You need to get closer to the TV just to be sure you're selecting what you want.  But the price is the real killer.

I understand trying to milk it for all its worth and it is nice getting half of a season out when a show likes to break up its seasons like originals on SyFy (prefer the old SciFi moniker) tend to, but the pricing is outrageous, just as it was for Battlestar Galactica.  Atlantis and SG-1 always hit at reasonable prices for their time.  Maybe it's because SGU is more expensive to produce.

So definitely watch SGU, but don't buy it until MGM understands how much they are ripping off the fans and lowers the price.",1270512000,3,2094,4.21356783919598

It lacked the optimism and characters of the original Star Gate series. It also lacked the edginess and soul of the Battlestar Galactica series that it tried desperately to emulate. SO far taking what worked from BSG and Star Gate and mixing it together has not produced a winner.

The characters are a mess and are the root of the shows problems. There are no anchor characters or at least no anchor characters that you will like. Dr. Rush the scientist is all the worst stereotypes of a mad-scientist rolled into to one shifty guy that no one trusts. The military commander is weak and stupid. By all rights they should die horribly.  So far it's a bad soap opera. I HATE the math-nerd sci-fi nut- he should die.

In trying to be edgy, all of the characters are too flawed. No one is ready or able to step up and be the classic hero.

OH and I hate the remote body changing stones! That's so bogus and cheesy. It wastes time, is a distraction and creates a soap opera that doesn't advance the series.

On a positive note, the science has been solid thus far- even impressive. Not every world has pine trees and oxygen. The ship taking a dip into star coronas to recharge was interesting. The music has been outstanding.

3971593,2,B002R8JG5I,"Where to start?

I'm a Stargate fan, and I've seen all the prior episodes from both shows.  But I'm not a hardcore fanatic.  I have no more stake in the Stargate franchise than the 44 minutes I choose to devote to each episode.  I just liked the shows because they gave me a solid sci-fi adventure based in the here-and-now.  Unfortunately, SGU doesn't deliver, and I'm saddened to say this show doesn't live up to the legacy, reputation, or quality of its predecessors.

My biggest complaint is, as much as I liked 'Battlestar Galactica', I'm hating the direction of this show.  Sure, I can appreciate a departure from the same thing we've gotten for over a decade with 'SG-1' and 'Atlantis', but not this way.  Stealing 'Star Trek: Voyager's' premise was bad enough.  But I don't need a direct rip-off of BSG---from the shaky hand-cams, mostly twenty-something cast, the dour demeanor, general distrust, to the generic utilitarian dark colored ""sci-fi"" uniforms, dim lighting, blossoming love triangles, unlikable characters, and direct BSG character references.  Is this all they could come up with?  At best another season of BSG, or at worst a pathetic attempt to ride the critical acclaim of BSG's coat tails?

'Universe' is not fun.  Nor is it witty or clever. (So far.)  It's so painfully dreary and so artificially contrived to be ""edgy"" and ""frantic"", that it winds up becoming a glaring farce.  We're stuck with 'Lost' inspired flashbacks and faux mystique, and we even get the '24' inspired clock ticking that continues to try to amp up the anxiety and tension by not allowing the survivors adequate time to explore new planets.  Instead of exploring the titlebar ""Universe"", the show wants us to instead focus on interpersonal human relationships set on a dirty, steam-punk starship that has seemingly little interior lighting.  Well then, what's the point of making this a sci-fi (syfy?) show if it all boils down to stuff I can see on normal TV shows that don't take place in space?  The linear path of SGU and general lack of creativity is its fatal flaw, and it's beginning to be overkill.  I'm already getting bored with the formula, probably because I got my fill of it the last few years with BSG.

What makes it worse, is the generally unlikable characters, characters I can't relate to, or people I care nothing about.  I like Colonel Young because he seems like he's a grounding factor to Dr. Baltar, err, I mean Dr. Rush.  I also really like Master Sergeant Greer because he's complex and dimensional, not a cardboard pretty face most of the rest of the cast is.  But on the flip side, I can't stand our main protagonist, Eli. Yeahhh..., an overweight, older Wesley Crusher/Gamer/Magic-Man archetype trying to be funny with lame jokes and obnoxious kino-camera close-ups is the last thing in the world that will help me connect to the show through his eyes. I wonder if Eli is Brad Wright's ""Mary Sue""?  'The Last Starfighter' did a helluva better job at drawing me in with a plot that centered around a gamer being taken to space to save the universe.  All we need now, is some ""World of Warcraft"" references or Eli complaining about no Mountain Dew, and we'll be set.  That, or maybe a sex scene that appears out of nowhere...

As for the rest of the principle cast---I could care less about Colonel Telford, Lieutenant Scott and Johansen, Ms. Wray, or Ms. Armstrong.  The only purpose of their characters so far, is to bring in mindless and immature high school angst and antics.  In fact, I'm surprised there isn't a token goth on board to remind us once again, that things are ""dark"" and ""bleak"".  These proxy characters could all be killed, left behind, mutated, and I wouldn't even think twice.  At least with the prior SG shows I immediately felt some connection with the cast in the first few episodes.  What makes the SGU cast seem nice on paper---clean slates and relatively unknowns for most of them, unfortunately holds them back in reality for me, because I have nothing that connects me to them, and there is no grounding facet that makes me even want to care.  To me, most everyone is boring, categorically stamped into one mode, and are shallow caricatures.  Am I being unfair?  Perhaps in theory, but in reality no, because there have been other new shows I picked up immediately that were great, or resonated with me that prompted me to stick with them.  Now, with that said, I don't blame the actors or actresses.  They're only following a script and doing what they were told to do.  I place all the blame on the writers and creative team.  But needless to say, the irony of mocking such a cast composition with younger, alleged ""edgier"" cast members in SG-1's 200th episode is not lost on me.

The props and background offer nothing interesting or unique to look at, computer displays are muted, and really, all the camera wants us to do, is focus exclusively on the crew to the exclusion of the rest of the sci-fi world around them.  Otherwise it's just dark hallways, mostly empty rooms, and filty reflective surfaces---windows, mirrors, and camera lenses; all covered with a halo of grime.  I can understand the exterior windows being difficult to clean, but there's no reason why someone couldn't wipe off the kino lenses or the mirrors---unless they were supposed to stay dirty to ground an oh-so-transparent (pun intended) plot-point every week that the ship is ""gritty"" and ""old"".

My last complaint is the potential of the ancient database or previously undisclosed ancient technology being used as the deus ex machina.  Yeah, it was like that in the prior shows, but here there is a far greater opportunity for abuse to retcon or explain away things.  I don't want to see universal translators, food and water replicators, and the like added in and explained as ""Oh, Eli found that information in the Ancient Database, and the ship built it out of spare parts."" Granted it hasn't happened yet, but the long range communication stones are a stretch.  So, you need a Stargate with nine chevrons to go to that part of the galaxy---launched at a singular location (Icarus Base) that was the only place you knew of that could provide sufficient energy to power it, yet you can call someone up at the same range and have video, audio, and ""possession"" technology with the ancient's laptop sized phone. Okay...  Of course, we all know the truth here.  The Earth scenes are merely a plot device because the producers know the show isn't strong enough to carry on isolated by itself, so they need the safety crutch of familiar guest stars and ""home"" as a reinforcing beacon to break up the monotony and dreariness of Destiny and her new crew.

Oh, and one more thing:  I love Joel Goldsmith's work, but I think he's very underutilized in SGU because his music is essentially boiled down to uninspiring ambient background droning, a far cry from the near-epic pieces he had in the prior shows.  This folly is compounded by the mostly awful, cheesy, and inappropriately placed ""music videos""---most of them with lyrics that were seemingly gleaned from pre-school music class.

I'll continue to give SGU a chance until the season ends to see if it gets better.  And for nothing else, I do want to see what happens with the few characters I do like.  But if things continue on this path, I can't see the show making it past a second season.",1268784000,13,7382,4.748235294117647

For example. They discover that thousands of gallons of water are suddenly missing from the water tank. So they decide to do a room by room search to see who stole it. What the?? I'm not making this up. You see them looking under mattresses and checking closets! The writers apparently envisioned someone dragging thousands of gallons of water through the ship unnoticed and putting it into their room which is one fourth the size of a one bedroom efficiency.  Under the mattress yet.

But the writer's apparent difficulty visualizing relative spaces continues when they replenish enough of the thousands of lost gallons of water to continue on their way by hauling in about 3 bathtubs full of ice.

Then there's the whole basis for not being able to return to earth. You know, that there isn't enough power on the ship to open the stargate to earth?  Okay. This makes sense. But a few episodes later something happens and power renews and so theoretically the show should have ended by the 4th episode. Right? Well, they had their chance to end it. Cornered again, they mumble something about the ship being broken and so they can't dial earth. Clever twist. eh?

I can go on. But I won't. With either this write up nor watching episodes any longer. There are no clever plots, there is no science fiction, and no mature characters. It is all boring.

It's lost in space. Pun intended.",1268611200,46,1926,4.829787234042553

This is why there's dvds, you know: If you want the same story told over and over again, watch the same dvd. SG-1 was wonderful, Atlantis was, well, cool. But their demise was well overdue. These episodic sf series are 90s and 00s stuff. Would you really want another two or three seasons of jumping to another planet (looking like southern Canada) saving another people (looking like middle-ages meets Jules Verne) from some baddy and being back after 45 minutes? I don't.

Daniel Jackson has been resurrected once already. Look at Anderson-O'Neill in the SG-U-pilote: old and chubby. They tried to bring Samantha Carter to Atlantis; to not much avail. It was over. And Atlantis got interesting, after they started to heal Wraiths. When it wasn't clear anymore who was bad and who was not. It was time for something new. And they did that with SG-U. The characters are interesting again. The plots are non-linear. The planets are, well, out there, again. Like in the original movie. You don't know what it is all about before seeing some episodes.

But no. You all want the same stuff over and over and over again. Like some endless fan convention.

And please stop whining about this being only the first half of the season. This is how they do it, these days. It's a pity, but if you don't like it, don't buy it.

My main problem with this show is the fact that it is too much like Battlestar Galactica, which I refused to watch after about the third episode. I cannot stand the way the show is designed to feel so much like a soap opera. The purpose of science fiction is to give us hope, not to depress us with the totally unrealistic and depressing relationship drivel being pushed upon us in lieu of plot.

The other major drawback is this DVD set is only half of season 1. This ticks me off!!! Why do I have to pay almost the full price of a season for a half season. NBC did this with BSG and I think it bit them in the butt. Less people actually bought the half seasons then if they were the full seasons.

This show had some promise but between the writing and the DVD half season release I think this show is going to die.

3971623,3,B002R8JG5I,"I have read all the reviews and comments to this point, and apparently no one has the same reason I have for buying this DVD:  I am unemployed.  I saw joblessness coming, and I began cancelling all optional expenditures last June.  One of the first to go was DirecTV.  That took away the Scifi Channel.  While I was aware that SG-U was in production, I had not seen it until I bought the DVD the other day.  I have a ten-year-old Gateway computer at home, and no way to take advantage of modern technology to download episodes from the internet.

I think that was a pretty good reason to buy the DVD. I stayed up all night watching the whole thing, and then I started over again, listening with the commentaries.  I haven't made it through all of those, yet.

I've never seen the modern version of Battlestar Galactica.  I am old enough that I saw the original series when it aired, and while recognising the essential sloppy ""science"" and lousy writing, it amused me greatly.  So did Lost in Space and Land of the Giants.  I'm old enough that the new BSG promos showing pretty young people simulating sex did not elicit any interest from me at all.  I want more than that to convince me to spend the increasingly few hours of my life watching a program.  Soap operas bore me.

Therefore, the reviews of SG-U comparing it to the new BSG may be accurate or they may be mistaken; I have no personal knowledge of that point.  I expect that the Stargate folk would call these aspects of their new program an ""homage"" to BSG.  That's what they usually do in the commentaries.  It reminds me of Gilligan's Island, Star Trek Voyager, the promos for Lost (I have not seen that, either, due to having been burned by Twin Peaks), Lord of the Flies, and Space 1999.  It seems overly-derivative, but in ten episodes, they did finally catch my interest, along about episode four at the end, or five.

I am particularly annoyed by the seriously bad weak character the writers give the largely American cast of refugees.  I watched these people screaming and whining and backstabbing and I was put in mind of what I have read about the way the British people handled the Blitz.  Firsthand accounts say that the people were magnificent at handling the perpetual stress of imminent death.  So, why is this group of scientists and soldiers, professionals all, portrayed as such a bunch of cowards and weaklings?  Truly, I don't see that as being the American character, and for sure, not that of our military.

I know the US Air Force has been pleased to be of assistance in facilitating SG-1 and SG-A, but I cannot imagine why they would want to be associated with SG-U as it currently presents the military.  The character portrayed by Lou Diamond Phillips appears to be unsupervised; if he worked for me and I found him doing what his character is doing through episode ten, I would have him on report, at the very least.

The Stargate universe (SG-1 and SG-A) has a long tradition of the IOA micromanaging everything it can, so the soap-opera-conscription of Ming Na's character to take command and to conspire with and spy for the Earthbound members of the IOA is no surprise.  The IOA always does that.  However, the Air Force should know better; if Jack O'Neill is theoretically still around, then he has had a radical personality change to send LDP and two scientists to take actions on Destiny which are opposed by the colonel actually in command ON the ship.

It seems to me that one of the reasons the USA lost the VietNam War was micromanaging by people not in the field, or so I have read.  If a little old lady in Idaho knows the US military learned from that, why doesn't the Stargate crew in Vancouver know that?  Ostensibly, THEY are the ones who actually KNOW the military?

I am interested, but I am not impressed.  I will watch the next half season DVD when it comes out, but I think it won't be worth staying up all night to finish.  The characters are all mawkish, cartoonish, or inconsistent, and very few are even likeable.  Rush is clearly quite a few sandwiches short of a picnic; no matter how brilliant he is, I would never have trusted him to be in charge of figuring out how to dial the ninth chevron.  There's no indication that any superior of his escaped to Carter's ship or was killed in the attack on Icarus; he was in charge.

They've added too much salacious sex to attract the short-attention-span generation.  Someone in one of the comments to an earlier review called this ""Dawson's Stargate 90210"", and I find that remarkably apt.  The Colonel in charge shows great physical strength, but little self-control.

Why are there so many people on this ship who think that they are still living on Earth in a democracy?  I think a lot of aspects of this program are very sloppy.  I'm willing to see if it improves, but my patience and pocketbook are not infinite.  I resent being unable to get the extras included in the box set of Stargate SG-1 the entire series without buying it all over again, because I was a fan who bought each season as it was released.

In some ways, it's great for me that the powers which be are releasing this series half a season at a time, but they are charging us through the nose for it, and the product isn't the only thing stinking up the atmosphere.

3971624,5,B002R8JG5I,"I am a little surprised at some the scathing one-star reviews here.  No, it isn't like the original series or SGA, both of which were likableshows, if not a bit hokey at times.  This is not BSG either.  The actors are not quite as physically attractive as those on BSG, nor is the show quite as intense or as absorbing as the first 3 seasons of that amazing show.  However, this show is good and does hold my interest.  It is a bit dark at times and maybe more realistic than some escapists care for in their sci-fi.  I am impressed with some of the actors here---particularly Robert Carlyle.  I am looking forward to watching the second half of the season.  We have been left with a cliff-hanger for a while now.  Was hoping this would be paired with Caprica mid-season, but I guess I can wait until April for that to be resolved.  The show starts slow and builds momentum as it goes.  Sometimes we get where we are going too fast with certain sci-fi shows (excepting with LOST, of course) and the show burns out or repeats itself too much.  This show has a lot of room for growth and the potential to offer many unique plots dealing with what may be found outside the known galaxies, and it can easily connect with the Stargate shows from the past a little bit, too.

It certainly has an excellent premise and could have several years to go as a series without becoming redundant.  As far as the release of HALF of season one, I do agree that is a bit of a scam.  BSG did that as well with a couple seasons, if I remember correctly.  It does offer those who missed the first half a chance to catch up, though, which is nice and may be good for the show's future ratings!

This characters are boring the situations are boring, with the resolution to whatever the problem of the week is uninspired. This show is very slow dark and insipid. Then the SyFy channel adds insult to injury by trying to sell a half season for a full season price. I would not buy this DVD for $1.95.",1266192000,4,440,4.5125

This is not some fight-monsters-make-quips-be-an-action-hero quasi-science fiction because people shoot aliens.  This is a show much more in line with actual science, physics and the hazards of being alone in space. Characters are deeply felt, most of the shows are actual nailbiters with real tension since characters can and have died on the show (like Stargate was ever going to kill a character with a speaking role in the fifth episode of any given season).

For fans of the latest Battlestar Galactica series, the parallels are obvious. A group of people, with no way to get home, are doing everything they can to survive against the ravages of space, and all the while having little human dramas amongst themselves. Now don't get me wrong, I am probably the biggest fan of BSG out there, and it does my heart good to see another show follow it's example. But this show is no BSG.  That said however, this is the closest we're going to get anytime soon. Cliffhanger half-seasons and all.

Now, as to this dvd set.. here is another area they are 'inspired' by BSG is the half-season series format, along with the half-season DVD format. This set is 10 shows. Be warned. I would suggest downloading the shows from iTunes or Amazon itself if they're available, and then getting the DVD set when the whole thing is released.

It's a complex set and complicated story, but I think the producers and the network should have prepared for the show's success rather than let it flounder while the nay-sayers wax poetic (go to facebook and count the number of ""it sucks"" - poetry for the culturally impaired). Many of us who love this breakaway story are now wondering why we were deserted at the ascent of a deep, dark, substantial series that has the potential to assuage the needs of those of us who don't want fluff, beautiful muscular half-naked warrior aliens and nothing more than dry mundane dialogue dressed up as ""snappy."" Each of the characters in this show is fascinating, starting with Dr. Rush.  He's obnoxious, snide, brilliant, and probably the only hope for the people aboard the ancient ship.  He's played to the hilt by Robert Carlyle.  Colonel Young is a perfect nemesis for Rush, and a mystery man himself. David Blue as ""Math Boy"" is as disarming and snarky as he was when he played Logan Griffin in Moonlight.  It would be wonderful to see Eli grow and mature.

I could live with only a half season that comes out early but only if it was priced accordingly.  So if you are looking for the WHOLE of season one I would recommend you wait till SG*U 1.5 (or what ever it will be named) comes out.

3971637,5,B002R8JG5I,"I will get the price point stuff out of the way before getting on to my review of the show.  SyFy pioneered the approach of splitting a season in half.  It allows for versatility for actors to pursue multiple projects and allows for stretching out writing deadlines.  It also allows them to release more DVDs (or in my case Blu-rays) more often.  They charge what people are willing to pay.  If people don't buy at the current price, it will come down.  I guess those of us who are buying at this price are messing it up for the rest (I paid under $40 on Amazon and was happy with that ... for those of you who don't want to pay, there is always that video-rental-by-mail service).

THE REVIEW
I was one of those viewers who took a while to warm up to SGU.The concept seemed fine at first, new galaxy, new bad guys, hey, new Stargate!  As the series started I suddenly realized that this would be a very different kind of Stargate.  To understand this, lets take a quick look back at the previous incarnations of Stargate.

Stargate SG-1(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-1-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000TJBNHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-1: The Complete Series Collection</a>) was a science fiction episodic action series.  Although there were story arcs, each day's adventure was wrapped up in an hour less time for commercials, for the most part.  It had all of the hallmarks of your basic action series.  A wise-craking action hero lead, a hot female costar to add sexual tenson, the bad guy turned good and the brainy geek who becomes a hero.  The characters you were presented with in episode one are pretty much unchanged by the end of the series (just older, but pretty much unchanged in their personality and demeanor - and before you say Daniel changed ... that is part of the recipe ... he had to change).  Wow, can you get more stereotypical than that?  But guess what?  It worked.  It appealed to people's basic desires in a show, required very little actual brainwork to watch, and at the end of the hour, more often than not, you walked away with a good feeling knowing that the bad guys lost, the good guys won, and the universe has been saved once more.

Stargate Atlantis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B002EL4RLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis: The Complete Series Collection</a>) was very much like SG-1, except it started to weave in a little more drama.  Not much, but a little, usually seen in the fact that endings were left more amiguous, episodes were more interconnected, and more episodes focused in individuals and relationships.  Mostly SGA suffered from a problem with cast stability and some poor decisions by the producers in thinking they could do better with Amanda Tapping's Colonel Carter than with Tori Higginson's Dr. Wier running Atlantis.  Sadly, this was not the case, and the diminished audience between SG-1 and SGA was never erased.  In the end, SGA was everything it could be, and in it's own right it was the little brother or sister that lives in the shadow of the older sibling.  That is how it started, and that is how it ended.

Now we come to Stargate Universe (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-SG-U-1-0-Blu-ray/dp/B002R8JG5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate SG-U: 1.0 [Blu-ray</a>]).  Stargate Universe is a completely different paradigm for the Stargate franchise.  Kind of like when Star Trek Deep Space Nine put the Star Trek franchise on an unmoving space station.  There was resistance at first.  Die hard trekkers hated it ... but eventually, they warmed up to it enough that it had a solid seven-season run.  So what is different about SGU?  First: it is a sci fi DRAMA, not action series.  There are no ""bad guys"" so to speak.  Good guys and bad guys are the products of the good and evil the characters carry around in their own hearts.  The adventure in SGU is not traveling the universe and saving it, it is survival against the odds.  The show focuses more on character development and how people react to situations thay can only barely control.  There will be more relationships (we have seen those already), more jealousy, more situations where someone is definately with the wrong person ... and before you say ""Melrose Place in Space"", understand this: Stargate SG-1 started in 1997.  If you were 15 when you started watchign SG-1, you would be 27 now.  Most people, change and grow during that amount of time, and your tastes (theoretically) should have matured away fromthe action adventure genre and more towards the drama genre.

So , what does SGU have?  It has Nicholas Rush!  Definately the lead character, but somewhat of an anti-hero.  His motives are constantly questioned, because face it they ARE questionable.  He has the common fault of most geniouses: ""you wouldn't understand it, so I won't bother explaining it to you or even telling you about it"".  He constantly underestimates people around him, and feels superior to them in every way.  He believes that brains will eventually defeat brawn, which hopefully he will now start to question after the events of ""Justice"".

It has an ambiguous military structure.  You have Co. Young and Lt. Scott, both of whom are the rugged action hero type, one tempered by age and experience, the other ... not so much.  Different people look to one or the other of them for leadership.  While Lt. Scott obviously deferes to Col. Young in that area, you can just see that issue will take center stage eventually.

It has hot women.  Chloe, Lt. Johanson and Lt. James spring to mind quickly, and although Chloe is the obvious main sexpot of the series, the producers aren't putting all of their eggs in one basket.  They know different men prefer different types of women, and if you don't like a 23 year old hottie, why not a statuesque blonde of Scandanavian descent, or a brunette who looks like she could have wandered in off the pages of an Eddie Bauer catalog? (that is, if Eddie Bauer sold fatigues)

It has Destiny!  I think that even more than the people, the central charachter is the ship.  Destiny is, in the truest sense every nerd's dream.  Kind of like the prom date who plays hard to get, Destiny sems unwilling to give in to the advances of the team as they try to learn her secrets, both for the purpose of survival, and for the voyage home.

Stargate Universe is not your daddy's Stargate.  It is darker, grittier, and more dramatic ... it is more, well, human.  SG-1 showed us how we would want to be if we suddenly ended up with alien technology to play with.  SGU shows how we WOULD be.  It is a mirror of the viewer, and if you don't like it, it probably showed you something in yourself that you don't like.",1266019200,7,6875,4.972830850131464
3971638,1,B002R8JG5I,"Another in a long series of HALF seasons from the SciFi, oops, SyFy, channel...or is is PsyFi now?  I do not think they understand what a ""season"" is.  Beware that this set only contains 10 episodes.",1265932800,2,199,4.5
3971639,1,B002R8JG5I,"At this price point for LESS THAN HALF a season, the studio executives obviously are trying to kill this series off.  It pains me to rate this a single star, for I REALLY ENJOY Stargate SG-U and believe a lot of potential is out there for future seasons and story lines.

I picked this package at WalMart yesterday and nearly walked out the door with it, until I noticed the price.  Next, I came here to Amazon thinking I'd get it cheaper -- and it is the same absurdly over-priced amount!

Some ignorant studio exec is going to look at these ratings and resulting P!SS-POOR sales and deem this show to be a failure.  They won't realize that it's not the content dragging this show down -- but the price point.  Come on MGM, why do you think you can get off charging more than double for a fractional season, than I paid for full seasons of Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis?  It is totally asinine and I won't do it.  MGM, you complain about piracy and consumers stealing your shows.  And then, you try to pilfer from me?  I don't pirate!  In return, I expect you (MGM) to not be a thief and attempt to rob me.

There is no reason to charge this much for a partial season, unless someone in the studio firmly has an ax to grind with this series and desires to kill it off.  Or someone in the studio wants to stick it to the fans.  All this makes me sad and mad.  Decent sci-fi series usually take a season or two to really get going -- and the studio is conspiring against Stargate SG-U.",1265932800,,1481,4.239285714285714

There are also a lot of extended scenes that enhance the viewing.  For example when Rush first went back using the stones, this scene was not in the original airing.  It is on the DVD.
Those that want to complain and not purchase will miss out on a lot of extra's like this.
MGM will NOT sell the complete season before the show even airs.  Those that are waiting for the entire season will be waiting until the Fall, most likely.

3971643,1,B002R8JG5I,"It's simple: I do not like this because it's too dark. After half a season we still don't know much about the characters. With their ability to go home every once in a while, too much soap opera drama ensues as well as a lack of sense that they are stranded millions of light-years away from our solar system. I don't care that some corporation is trying to take over the project. What are they going to do so far away? I don't care that so-and-so is having an affair with someone's wife. These people need to focus on the task at hand - like getting back to earth. hello?

Sci Fi is supposed to be about hope and examine the human condition. This show is depressing and it just shows how selfish &/or disturbed everyone can be. After a while I started to wonder who let these people in the stargate program anyway? I understand trying to appeal to adults but please, adults do have brains. Give us something that is more interesting and challenging other than the dark-lit soap that it's become.",1265846400,9,996,4.413043478260869
3971644,5,B002R8JG5I,"Stargate: SG1 tended to be an episodic show where it is still easy to rerun episodes out of order and it probably won't matter. And Stargate: Atlantis, while separate, was still tied to the SG1 universe.

Yes, there is adventure in both.

What we have here is a dark story of survival. Limited rations, limited understanding of their surroundings, and the ability to explore their environment make it seem, to me, more like a narrative story of an adventure game where the important goals are interaction and self/group preservation. This would be a perfect setting for Traveller, in other words. I want deckplans!

Is it a refitted Lost? No. Is it Voyager all over again? No.

This is a bleak, dark examination of how people band together to live past tomorrow. This is by far the best show that I've seen, so far, that communicates the fear of being trapped in a closed environment with no way to fail and then live to try again.

Is it perfect? No. But if anything, it's not a cookie cutter repeat of the other two Stargate series.

I hope the communication stones short out permanently. So what if it's allowing us to explore the different facets of various characters, it's a cheat and detracts from the essence of the show.

Kino the Wonder Ball? Idunno, I can see where it can fit within my internal consistancy model as appropriate to Ancient technology. Should we think that if the Ancients had it on the ship, that we should have seen it in the other two series? Sure. Without a doubt.

Maybe this isn't the same show style as the other two, but I for one, like it, and can't wait for the rest of the season.",1265760000,9,1618,4.517123287671233

I love those shows! And I will admit I was super excited for Universe...but what is this? The characters could be likable if they didn't back stab each other every other minute. WAAAAAAAY over dramatic. Stargate is known for its sense of humor! Where is the Jack O'Neill??? Where is the John Sheppard??? Where are the characters we like. And I mean characters like them...not actually them. Although It would definitely help Universes situation here! Anyway, Im gonna stop complaining and keep watching HOPING that it will get better!

3971648,1,B002R8JG5I,"After so much hype and hopeful anticipation, Stargate Universe has failed to deliver on every level. The show is slow and boring. There is no discernable plot and no developing story arcs. The episodes are about which crew member is going to have a personal crisis this week; such as when Scott discovers his 16 year old pregnant girlfriend did not have the abortion as she said she would, or when Chloe goes back to Earth to visit her mother who is in an drunken stupor and then she goes to a bar and is upset to find out her friends don't like her very much.. How is this science fiction? In fact, this is not even good drama. Watching the show might be even somewhat tolerable if the characters were at all likable. They are not. I have watched the first 10 episodes. I will not watch any more.

To make it worse MGM is selling the first 10 episodes of the season, yes, only  a season for the price of what you could get a full season of SG-1 or SGA. This is so sleazy. I do not recommend you purchase this DVD set because the quality of the show is poor and the selling of  a season for the price is a rip-off.

3971650,1,B002R8JG5I,"I know I'm in the (apparent) minority for saying I like SGU, but allow me to explain. I've been an avid fan of the Stargate franchise since the film, and I enjoyed the weekly adventure, run-and-gun, not-that-serious t.v. shows. But as I grew older (I'm under 25, btw), I started to lose interest. By the end of the first season of SGA, I was done. The show was too formulaic, and I wanted something deeper, more character driven.

That's what SGU is. This is not ""planet of the week"" like SG1 or SGA. This is a series that has a very clear through-line with multiple arcs and is driven purely by the interplay between the characters. Yes, Robert Carlyle does not play a likable character - GOOD. Complex characters with deep motivations and hidden agendas are an EVOLUTION for the series, not a step back as so many claim. The pacing is noticeably slower in this series versus the others, but I enjoy what SyFy (still hate the re-branding) is doing. SGU is cinematic television. If you don't like it, SG1 and SGA are still available for purchase on Amazon.

Anyway, while I was there, they had crews all over the place doing behind the scenes shoots and interviews.  Those special features made it to this set, and they're impressive.  If you're a fan, you don't want to pass on this set.

SGU is not great because the show is too dark, the acting is horrible, there is no respect for authority, Dr. Rush character is horrible, Blue acts like he is stupid and looking a joke to happen, there is no charisma between actors. The LT doesn't have any respect for other military in the scene; the Colonel is not strong on delegation. They all appear like they are just standing around waiting for something to happen, they definitely act lost. True, they have two great acts to follow with SG1 and SGA therefore; they should try harder and not follow the pattern of Star Trek or BSG or even lost. The introduction of a sex act in the 1st scene flopped because the audience is true-blue Stargate followers demanding more of the show than sex-based audience. The writers have a job to gain back the viewing public, the directors need to get their actors to act, and the photographers need to lighten up the show and not wobble. Since you have written the show around only those that were transported through the gate when the base was destroyed you are limited to use what you have in the actor pool. I for one, am hoping it will improve or SYFY will start up the SGA or SG1 again. If it doesn't improve, the MGM and others have wasted a lot of money and pulled down the wrong shows (SHOWS THAT WERE GREAT SG1 AND SGA)",1265500800,8,1421,4.366037735849057
3971659,5,B002R8JG5I,"The Stargate franchise has been around for 13 years now (longer if you have it starting with the original feature film).  A lot of times, when a title has been around for that long in various forms (TV, film), it becomes a product, and therefore becomes formulaic over time.  The producers of the product think that viewers want the same old thing over and over again, kind of like people wanting Coke to taste like Coke.  But with a film or television product, it only remains interesting to viewers or marketable if it changes and adapts to changes in genre or medium.  For a lesson on that, one need only look at the Star Trek franchise.  The producers went in a different direction with Deep Space Nine than they did the previous two series, and thus kept the franchise alive for another decade.  Then, they returned to the same old Star Trek formula for Voyager and Enterprise, and Star Trek became stale.  In a world with such science fiction TV as Farscape, Babylon 5, Battlestar, and (dare I say it) Stargate, Star Trek looked like a lumbering dinosaur.  The Stargate producers seem to have learned from that because with Stargate Universe, they have adapted the concept to the new TV landscape and have gone in a bold new direction.

Instead of being a plot driven, action adventure show with big explosions and pure fun (like its Stargate predecessors), this show is more of a psychological drama which focuses on a crew of mashed together soldiers and scientists trapped on a ship in the far reaches of the universe.  This show is about survival, and has plenty of tense drama and character interplay to make it a fascinating ride to go on.  This is not say it is better or worse than its more action-oriented cousins (both of which were awesome series), but it is different.  With Stargate Universe's bold, fresh new take on Stargate, the producers have created a show that will keep the franchise alive well into the next decade.",1265500800,5,1942,4.6627565982404695
3971660,1,B002R8JG5I,"My wife and I had high hopes for Stargate Universe and were anxious for it to air. The first episode was promising but subsequent episodes have led us to abandon SGU altogether. It's almost as if the writers said to themselves 'BSG had such a following, let's pattern our show after theirs'. Instead of an involving series we get the same dark melodrama, the same jerky camerawork, instead of likeable characters we get a bunch of misfits that nobody cares about, a story that hasn't gone ANYWHERE, and two more frustrated and disillusioned viewers. We both loved Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis (still mad they cancelled Atlantis so soon) but Stargate Universe has lost all interest for us. We were hoping they'd drop the soap opera crapola and move on, but no such luck. There are better things to watch in its place.

This one post from the [...] (Ooops, I mean SyFy.com) Forums says it all for me. Kudos to TwiceWise for nailing it...

""In comparison this show seems like a tragedy. They've taken something noble and sullied it with sex, hatred, lying, cheating, backbiting, arrogance, condescension, and melodrama. And now we find our old friend Stargate stumbling out of a bar with a cheap hooker on his arm and a bag of heroin in his pocket. He's not fighting for freedom against the G'auld or Wraith but instead is looking for a cheap thrill before he staggers back to the rescue mission where he can sleep off his addiction and then get up and do it all again the next day. And we are mourning because the friend we knew is gone forever. There is a gaping hole where Stargate used to be. Yes there's a stranger who calls himself Stargate but we don't know him; he's full of anger and resents what might have been.

And so when people post here they post out of loss. There has been no funeral even though our friend has died. We are told we have no right to feel what we feel. We are told that we should just learn to pretend that this new impostor is really our old friend after all. And so, gradually, we turn to other channels on Friday night. There's that new show ""White Collar"" that's on, or maybe I could watch ""Dollhouse"" on Fox. But my old friend is absent. We used to meet up on Friday nights but he isn't here anymore. People are going to be angry, that's the way we deal with loss.

The anger will die down eventually. Fans will gradually get used to the fact that Stargate isn't on anymore, at least not the way it used to be. SG:U will either succeed or it won't, either way I'm not a part of it anymore. I haven't watched for the last three weeks and probably won't start again. What would be the point? In the place where Stargate used to be I could see a lesbian kiss, or a shouting match, or a nightclub scene. Funny, I don't remember any of that on the old Stargate. Let me see that TV guide again, that White Collar show looks pretty good, let's try that.""

I'm not a Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis fan; I saw the original movie when it first came out a loooong time ago but I've not watched the shows that came after. But I heard about SGU's premise and it intrigued me. So far, I like what I see. The show is definitely *not* your typical cup of tea. But if you prefer shows that have more depth and take their time to build tension, SGU is definitely worth it. Much like the re-imagined BSG, there is a definite attempt at realism and really taking into account what would happen if they were stranded on the Destiny. Robert Carlyle is brilliant in the role of Dr. Rush. Some of the others are also pretty good, but by far he's the best reason to watch the show.

A lot of comments are complaining about the fact that this DVD set is coming out when season 1 isn't finished so you're only getting a half-season. If you don't like that, there's a simple response - don't buy it! But, as someone else pointed out here, shows like SGU can stay on the air thanks to strong DVD sales. Weak sales won't help keep this show around. And really - it's $28 on Amazon. That's $2.80 per episode. I think this show - along with Caprica - are worth keeping around so I'll definitely be buying it.

I'm still very curious about all the carping about the price. You pay $28 for 10 episodes. For Firefly you'll pay $38 for 13 episodes, which is $2.92 per episode and yet I don't hear anyone complaining about that price!",1265328000,6,1492,4.325

It is a different type of Stargate than we are used to. I find the idea of it very intriguing and see great potential. I find the stories to be very interesting and like the idea that they are not just exploring, but trying to survive while trying to get back to Earth. Kind of reminiscent of The first season of Atlantis where they were completely cut off from Earth and had to survive in the Pegasus galaxy. The only difference is that they are flying blindly through space; with little resources, and don't really have a enemy to defeat. They do however fight amongst themselves. I think SGU takes on a realistic account of what could happen if a situation like this would happen. It shows how humans really act rather than how they should act. I gave the product 3 stars only because I don't like that they released half a season on DVD, but if I was rating the show itself I'd give it 5 stars.",1265241600,2,1070,4.199029126213592

I have seen all the episodes. There's absolutely no reason to release these seasons half a season at a time.

And yet, I am buying this. For the commentaries, which make me feel closer to the actors, who are the only reason I watch in the first place. And Ivon Bartok never fails to deliver excellent behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and special features.

None of the characters are likeable, except maybe Eli and Chloe, and I must admit I don't care whether they and Destiny ever make it back to Earth.  There is no cohesion, no humour, no tension and nothing to bring you back week after week to sit down for an hour to watch it. The actors utter their lines with no emotion and I cannot imagine what an actor of Robert Carlyle's calibre is doing in this.

With SG-1, for me it was the character interaction that were the glue keeping it all together, plus the actors just seemed to go together naturally. Over the years, they were like family each week. Not sure what SGU's premise of appealing to a younger audience means, I suppose there are some near genius young Einsteins around, but...come on, I don't know too many 16 year old physicists, MD's, scientists, experienced pilots, astronauts, etc. Of course, all the sex in the new SGU makes the age point moot, whatever grabs ya I guess.

I won't give away what happened just in case someone hasn't seen it but it was great.

I loved that the characters were relative unknowns as far as big names go, or at least unknowns to me.  It gives you a chance to like the character a little more with no baggage left over from some other show.

I was never a fan of Stargate (original series), the characters were too plastic and predictable, I love Atlantis Stargate and I love this new one.

(As opposed to the usual regurgitated science fiction dribble.) From what we, the audience have seen of season one, the show feels lopsided. As if it cannot decide what niche it wants to fall into. Sometimes it tries to be a scifi epic and others it appears to focus heavily on interpersonal drama.

However, that being said, my review is based on this concept of a ""half season"" release.

I used to hit the 24-hour walmart (about an hour away) right at midnight to get each season of SG1 and SGA then subsequently stay up all night and (calling out of work the next morning) into the following day. My wife even stayed home with me once or twice and watched them too. (more to humor me, of course. That's what happens when you marry a geek.)

I will totally swallow just about anything with ""Stargate"" in the title.... but even I cannot abide by these half season DVD releases.  Grah!

I simply do not understand the concept: The full season will total $60 dollars? That is quite the price increase from our beloved previous series.  Supposedly, the ""retail price"" is $50 per (half) season. This would indicate that the full retail price for a complete season would be $100?  .....

But this show didn't get better it got worse over time. Of course, to each his own but I found it very boring and perverted to the point where after ep 10 I couldn't watch it anymore. By perverted I refer to the ""lost in space"" group being able to go back to earth by mind transfer and use the body of another person to do whatever.

Everything is dark, depressing and there's a lot of tension and sex.  A few ""controversial"" elements are thrown in like same-sex relationships, but are more tacked on than integral to the story.

What's really wrong with SG:U is that there are no likable characters.  They are pitiable or have grating personalities that serve as the source for constant bickering.  That's not why I watch Sci-Fi (or any drama) and even BSG ""got"" that.  All of the likable personalities like Daniel Jackson, Ronon, or Samantha Carter are tossed away and you are left with a ship full of people like Dr. Elizabeth Weir and Robert Picardo's Richard Woolsey from his SG:1 days fighting with one another.  It's uncomfortable and not in a way that is rewarding to viewers.

The absolute best thing about this series and the reason I keep watching is that it takes a lot of the cornball Flash Gordon-style Sci-Fi from the SG series and tries to make it realistic while not throwing away the hundreds of episodes that came before in a reboot.

For example, Atlantis had potential with a more realistic theme but missed the mark and instead had every other planet looking like Canada with humans who speak perfect English living in another galaxy...!  And the excuse that they all came from Earth didn't really hold the same water as it did with the Goa'uld.  So, Atlantis could have easily taken place anywhere with a stargate, really.

SG:U turns up the dial on the realism and has ice planets, desert planets and generally inhospitable places with long abandoned Stargates and no small colonies of people that look like they came from a California college campus despite being separated from other humans for centuries.  In short, it feels much more real, much more believable.

But Stargate fans never really CARED for realism.  These things that bugged me all along never bugged them.  And they didn't need the fistfights, sobbing, and general depression of Battlestar Galactica.  And many BSG fans look down their noses at SG as a popcorn Sci-Fi series.

SG:U would have been much better, in my opinion, as a new Science Fiction series with no ties to SG.

Will I keep watching?  Yes, but I fear it may not last long past the first season.",1264464000,7,2507,4.728110599078341

3971691,4,B002R8JG5I,"Anyone who tuned in to ""Stargate Universe"" not only expecting but deeply desiring a show like ""Stargate SG-1"" or ""Stargate Atlantis"" was (and probably still is) extremely disappointed by this venture . . . unless he or she is willing to be open-minded.

The complaints range from ""the show's too dark"" (visually and thematically) to ""most of the episodes take place on the ship"" to ""it's like Melrose Place in space"" to ""this is just 'Star Trek Voyager' without Neelix"" to ""there's not enough action/comedy"" to ""what's with all the sex"" to ""why is there a lesbian on the show.""  As a fan of all things Stargate (except, maybe, that cartoon that they had), I have to say that: the seriousness of the show is a refreshing change; the ""bottle episodes"" haven't been bad (translate as: it didn't seem like the producers were just looking to save money on planetary sets for a few weeks); Robert Carlyle is fantastic (as is the guy playing the colonel); there's plenty of action (but more of the people hitting and yelling at each other sort); men and women in close, uncomfortable, dynamic situations tend to get all irritated with and/or attracted to each other (see ""Lost"" or, basically, any other show, including the other Stargates).

Look, I'm a fan of all the James Bond movies, but since the reboot of that franchise, I can't help but think how campy they could be.  The Daniel Craig versions improved things tremendously.  Similarly, Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis could get quite campy, so I think ""SGU"" is a welcome change.

Give SGU--and yourself--some time to get into the swing.",1264377600,4,1583,4.801470588235294
3971692,1,B002R8JG5I,"Let me start off by saying there was never a show I wanted to like more than SG-U. I loved the movie, SG-1, and SG-A. I would like to continue to see the movies from SG-1 and SG-A so I ask, no beg, the producers of SG-U to kill the show before it ruins the franchise.
What's wrong with SG-U is better explained by asking what is right with the show, which is nothing. None of the characters are likeable (most are annoying), the show is written like a teen drama, military discipline is non-existent, and the concept is really not all that good. In essence SG-U is ""We are a bunch of whiney incompetent a-holes stuck on the USS Voyager and we can't control the ship. So let's act like a bunch of high school kids and fight among ourselves, have love/sex drama, and forget about any kind of professionalism or discipline.""
The characters are always what make the show and the characters in SG-1 and SG-A were always well done. I don't like any of the characters in SG-U, I would be happy if they all died. The worst of the characters are Rush, Eli, and Chloe. Note to the producers: an a-hole, doofus, and whiner, do not make a good or even watchable series. Secondly the Stargate franchise was always an action/science fiction franchise. I had heard the producers were trying to ""reboot"" the franchise with SG-U. The reboot had a POST failure: ""Error: Dawson's Stargate 90210"".
I could write more on how much I hate the show but it would just be repetitive. I watched the first eight shows and I just can't take anymore. Constructive criticism implies the show can be corrected, it can't. Please kill SG-U, concentrate on SG-1 and SG-A movies and try another ""reboot"" in a few years.",1264377600,22,1683,4.503267973856209
3971693,1,B002R8JG5I,"They can not be serious.  A $50 list price for ten episodes?  Even worse, it's for ten episodes that mostly weren't very good.  Total rip!

The Problem with SG-U:  The Stargate folks want a ""character-driven show.""  But nobody likes these characters!  So imagine how well things are going to go over when you spend 80 percent of every episode providing the backstory for characters nobody likes.  Even worse, the backstory has been making these characters even less likeable!

Example one:  Colonel Young.  The commander has no sense of humor.  Not necessarily a problem if you're going to make him a ""by the book"" character.  But he's not--he's willing to lie and, apparently, to unilaterally sentence an inconvenient character to death.  Yeah, Rush'll come back, I'm sure.  But that's not the point--Col. Young doesn't expect Rush to come back.

Example two:  Dr. Rush.  He's the ""genius"" of the show, a la Samantha Carter or Daniel Jackson or Rodney McKay.  Yeah, he's got all of the attitude of McKay.  But he doesn't seem to be too sharp, at least not if some Nintendo-playing fanboy is going to be saving the day.  So when Young finally starts pumelling Rush, sure that makes us feel good.  But is that what you want?  One character that's so annoying you want him to get beaten up?  Then what does that make us feel about the commander that can't control himself?

Example three:  The Nintendo-playing kid that's going to be the new lead scientist, I guess.  Sort of reminds me of Matthew Broderick's character from Wargames--if Broderick was fatter, more annoying, and willing to conspire with Col. Young to kill off an inconvenient character.

Example four:  Ming Na.  She's supposed to represent the IOA, but it seems like they picked her precisely because she could be controlled.  So picture a weaker, dumber, less assertive version of Tamlyn Tomita's character from SG-Atlantis.

If you put together a bunch of characters that nobody likes, that are basically less-attractive, more-flawed versions of characters we've seen before.  How can you expect us to like a show like this?  Who can we root for?  More importantly--Why would you think we'd want to pay $5 an episode to see this?",1264204800,15,2197,4.893732970027248

I'm not able to say that this encouraged me to watch further.  SG-U suffers from serious problems.  For one, it focuses on uncharismatic characters played by unskilled, uncharismatic actors.  This makes it dull, and I couldn't care about any of them, even in dramatic situations.  Nor was I comfortable when a crude sex scene suddenly came on screen.  Not a show for children, and maybe not for adults who like their science fiction to be SF and not a soap opera.  Too, the pilot had a lot of hysteria.  Shrieking, screaming, sobbing.  This definitely made me miss the rationality of the SG-1 or Atlantis crew.  Trivial guest appearances by these actors/characters don't help the series at all.  I began to find it not just dull but embarrassing.  I confess that I have only watched one additional episode, after which I gave this entire show a miss.  I don't doubt that the DVD set has the high quality of the previous Stargate sets, but to me, the show itself isn't worth purchasing, whether it's a half season or a whole.

I won't have this problem with SGU, I refuse to pay full price for 1/2 a season. So I'll wait for the series to end, and buy the complete set all at once without feeling burned for buying 8 collections of 1/2 seasons.

As for the show, its a little disappointing to those true stargate fans. They are in a completely different galaxy and for some reason the sense of exploration is completely gone. It was the exploration mindset that has held the different series together for so many years. The episode ""TIME"" that everyone keeps referring to as the best episode, was written and directed by Robert C. Cooper. He is the only thing keeping SGU alive. And the only writer this season that has done anything to make the show feel like a true part of the franchise. The other writers for SGU are horrible it's true. No one cares about the characters because the writing has been terrible. The acting from half the cast isn't much better. And the ""Stones"" that everyone keeps writing about do truly ruin the shows premise. What is the point of being lost in a completely different galaxy if you can phone home and tell them all about it.

But in the end what can you do?!?! It's the only new Stargate for a while so we will all continue to watch it wishing for the next SG1 or Atlantis movie. Its just too bad Robert Cooper can't write every episode of SGU. Even worse is the fact then when he does spend time on a new SG1 movie or Atlantis movie he has to leave SGU in the very uncapable hands of his writing staff.",1263859200,6,1669,4.295238095238095

(I agree that it is a greedy manoeuvre to sell just the first half of series one!!)

I cannot believe the low votes for this series!

I didn't think I would like it - being a 'die hard' fan of SG1 and a (slightly less die hard) fan of Atlantis too.
However, I love it.

Spoilers follow:
It has good storylines, great characterisations and really cool toys (I love how the team use the communications stones to be back on earth....well funky - and will make for some interesting goings on I am sure!)
I am entranced by the idea of the Star Drive - and I loved the episode when they 'discovered' thats what the ship was powered by.
(and it was a genius decision to cast Robert Carlyle...)
Magical stuff.

It is not up to SG1's undoubted magnificence, but so far it might at least stack up with Atlantis in terms of entetainment value.

I like it so far and have high hopes for it getting even better (even SG1 had a 'slow' start!)

In other words, I could not disagree MORE with the folks who are giving really negative comments!
I say to those people - feel free get back to watching your 'CSI type' rubbishy programmes and leave the interesting stuff for those that can engage with something a little bit less obvious and a whole lot more special.",1263600000,7,1297,4.316872427983539

Out of the 5 eps I watched, only one of them was even remotely good. The plots have holes and are plain boring and cheesy. The characters are utterly unlikable and not because they're weird or antiheroes, but because they're just annoying. Even Robert Carlyle's character is annoying. Dr. Rush is inconsistent and strange just for the sake of it it seems. His character is not believable and does strange stuff, not to advance the plot, but to get a shock out of the audience.

 Imagine your life in the hands of a scientist who combines a willingness to go to extremes for his research with an in your face intellectual snobbery. A man neither liked or trusted but is your best shot of returning home.
 A colonel who turned down his opportunity to command this mission but ended up with it anyway without the approval of his superiors.

To be honest, I almost didn't watch it due to all of the hate it had received, but I'm glad I did.  My first reaction to the series was that they definitely took some pointers from Battlestar Galactica (The shows fans may deny this, but the similarities are undeniable).  Now I must point out that I am a huge fan of SG-1 and Atlantis, but to be honest, both of those shows are light and easy going.  Universe is essentially, Stargate for the Battlestar era.  Its darker and more mature.  Battlestar showed that sci fi shows can be smart and thought provoking while satisfying fans of the Science fiction genre at the same time, and this is pretty much what Stargate Universe is trying to achieve.  As of right now, I'd say they are partly achieving it.

Episodes move at a fairly good pace, with a handful of decent-good episodes and about one that was really good.  As far as the acting goes, its good for the most part, but the main problem is that they really haven't achieved anything or gotten anywhere in the first ten episodes, they're still doing the same things.  I'm sure it will change, but its a minor problem right now.  The other problem IMO, is that Universe tries sometimes TOO hard to be like Battlestar.  The dark atmosphere, the shaky camera, and a whole lot of drama BSG style, it sometimes leaves you wanting the cheesiness of the originals.  If done right, I wouldn't mind having another show in the same vein as BSG, but first, Universe needs to make itself its own and stop trying to be something its not.  Universe is on its way there, they just need to fine tune the stories and series a little more and figure out where they want to go.

The pacing is the best sleep medicine you could take.

My best advice, go watch SG-1 or SGA or any other scifi series, stay away from this garbage.",1261958400,21,477,4.552941176470588
3971718,4,B002R8JG5I,"If you don't have a need to put sci-fi in a box (""It has to have big-action scenes""; ""It needs more aliens,"" etc.), and if you pay close attention to more subtle, carefully crafted plot developments, you'll find that Stargate Universe has consistently showcased some of the most intelligent, insightful, and thought-provoking sci-fi screenwriting to come along in quite a while. SGU's producers have also delivered on the Stargate franchise-characteristic change of look and insertion of lighter, ""don't forget to breathe"" moments. These elements make the show not only well-written as it now stands, but promise to keep the show well-worth watching over the long haul.

Just as impressive are the excellent SFX/VFX and photography; the show's superb scoring, extra songs, and audio effects; attention to detail with sets (and everything else) - all of which spotlight the art of appealing to all possible senses. These factors rewardingly torque up the intellectual demand of watching the show and taking in every single element included to enhance the experience. Usually I'd expect to have to wait for big-screen sci-fi to see production values this good.

The editing - for SGU, often a demanding job - has been incredible, and direction has been very, very good. Breathing life into all the above, the actors have consistently turned in outstanding performances. It would be difficult to say enough in this regard: great work by a well-chosen ensemble cast, with Robert Carlyle as the ""first among equals."" Character development and plot fuse seamlessly. This fusion lays the groundwork for a much richer type of storytelling than that offered by more conventional sci-fi presentations.

-- For the blu-ray edition, the special features are promised to be actually special - a rather rare event, in my experience. But, I think that assurance will prove to be true, since I've been extremely impressed by the Kino scenes shown on MGM's Stargate website. I can't wait to see these in blu-ray, and also have high hopes for the other features.

I can't emphasize enough my wish to support this show, out of simple self-interest: One episode makes my week. And given the multi-layered excellence that SGU offers, repeat viewing during the hiatus will be much, much more than simply an exercise in memorizing scenes. To that end, I'll pay the premium for this DVD, and defer some other purchase. To me, that's a small sacrifice for an outstanding product.",1261785600,5,2454,5.112219451371571

They couldn't wait to make as much money as they could on their new show and so they put only half the season on DVD but charged us the price of a full season.  DISGUSTING!!  And what's worse, Stargate Universe isn't even a decent program.  I've watched every episode since it aired in the hope that it would be a nice continuation of the Stargate storyline told by SG-1 and Atlantis but with enough differences to make it non-repetitive and interesting, but the makers of this show have failed to do that in every respect.  In short: IT'S BORING!!!  Nothing ever happens in the episodes; only one episode had any decent plot action to it, and even then it was tedious.  And as for the character relationships (which incidentally seems to be the focus of the show), they are about as artificial and unrealistic as you could imagine and the sources of character conflict are just too predictable to be interesting.  Just to give an example: boy likes girl, girl thinks boy is friend material, boy is sad, girl has sex with a hotter-looking boy, first boy gets jealous but doesn't say anything.  Yawn.  Incidentally, for the sake of being realistic, everyone on that ship is so promiscuous with each other that honestly you'd wonder why no one is pregnant yet (especially since they're all cut off from Earth and have no birth control).  Stargate Universe is a bad soap opera set in space.  If you like that sort of thing, then go ahead and buy it, otherwise save your money.",1261699200,100,1517,4.598513011152416
3971721,4,B002R8JG5I,"When I found out they were doing a new, original series of Stargate to replace the spin-off Atlantis, I was excited. Finally, something with all new characters and situations! In the end, it took me a while to get into it, because I went into it with the mindset that, while different, it would still have a whole bunch of Gate Travel and focus only on the action, like Atlantis seemed to.
 Instead, I find a series that focuses on the interactions of the characters and also focuses on their individual struggles, including how they interact with loved ones back home, at least for the ones whose loved ones are cleared for the Stargate Program. It also has an excellent, rich storyline, which has several sub-plots wrapped around it. I've found a few reviews of these episodes elsewhere, and several people who do those reviews seemed to be unable to understand that SGU is not another knock-off of SG1, where the plot is somewhat bland in places and there are hardly any sub-plots. The sub-plots I've seen so far are indicative that they're not going to be 'episodic plots', where they're solved in one or two episodes. They are going to continue down through the season.
  SGU is a great series, so far. Now, for my rant. What the freaking heck is Syfy thinking, releeasing a freaking 'half a season'? Okay, I get it somewhat, since they're not airing anymore episodes until April, but come on! Who buys half-seasons, really? The only reason I'll buy this, if I do, is because they're likely gonna hold back on a full season release until somewhere around the middle of the second season, which has just recently been green-lighted for production.
 So, in basic terms, good show with great plots and sub-plots, but a poor choice on the part of Syfy to release half a season just so that they can gain a bit more money from a franchise that is probably one of the few that actually keeps their station in business. Because it sure isn't there weekend movies that are completely moronic in plot and contain easily-spotted special effects.",1261699200,4,2040,4.689944134078212
3971722,1,B002R8JG5I,"The fact that they are even TRYING to sell a 1/2 season of Stargate Universe offends me, honestly.  I have to wonder if they really think we're that stupid, or if they are merely laboring under the misguided assumption that they are airing a top-quality SciFi show here???

I totally agree that these 1/2 season DVDs are a WASTE of money.  I also agree that this particular show is falling far short of expectations (to be charitable).  I have a DVR through my cable company and I DVR them & just watch these as convenient after they are aired.  This show is not worth staying home on a Friday night for.  So far, I am very unimpressed and probably will never own this on DVD.  It is a RARE show that is worth buying on DVD at all.  It is a VERY RARE show that can justify a 1/2 season on DVD.  SGU ain't one of them.
For the record, I own all the SG1 & SGAs on DVD I consider myself a fan.  I'm just very, very disappointed with SGU.

I give them 3 stars for the show itself, out of what may prove to be a misguided hope that it will find it's way.  I give them a ZERO star rating for trying to pork (probably the strongest term they will let me put on here) us by selling us 2 DVDs when this show would barely be worth the asking price if it were a full season.

As it is, if I go through 10 more mediocre episodes I may not even bother watching at all.  So far ""Life"" was the only episode that was of the old SG1 & SGA caliber.  ""Air"" was a total yawner and I almost gave up then.",1261612800,19,1483,3.9628378378378377

I have preordered Season 1 1.0. I, too, would like the whole season in 1 box but a half is more affordable and will fill in the LONG wait till April when the second half of the season airs.

3971724,4,B002R8JG5I,"OK, we all agree that breaking STARGATE UNIVERSE's first season into two parts is an absurdly greedy act on the part of MGM, no doubt emulating NBC Universal's sometimes splitting BATTLESTAR GALACTICA season's into bits.  MGM's decision is, however, more obviously greedy, since most fans were behind the release of the BSG box sets because the breaks between the parts of BSG Season 2 and 4 were close to a year, while STARGATE UNIVERSE's break is only about five months.  Like other reviewers year I don't see the point of splitting this.  It is going to make the total cost of the entire season prohibitively expensive.  In fact, while I would have bought the series on DVD had it been in one set, there is no way that I'm going to now.  I like STARGATE UNIVERSE, but not enough to pay over $60 for it.  BSG was a must-buy at any price for me, but this is more a would-consider-buying-at-a reasonably-cheap-price show.

The three previous STARGATE series were pleasant, light entertainment, certainly not among the best SF series ever made but definitely not among the worst.  Despite running for a combined sixteen seasons (ten for SG-1, five for ATLANTIS, and one for the largely forgotten STARGATE INFINITY) and developing a rather complex internal mythology, it remained a profoundly conservative franchise, taking few chances (unlike most of other shows of the past decade, the series had virtually no body count, the only shocking death being that of Dr. Fraisier).  So it was something of a genuine shock when the producers of the franchise decided to engage in a radical reset of the aesthetic of the series.  Suddenly a show that took no chances was taking some pretty big chances.

Many viewers of the show, viewers who do not care for shows that take chances, who want the same old same old year after year, revolted.  They simply didn't care for the new show, mainly because they just didn't want anything different.  And STARGATE UNIVERSE was dramatically different.  As someone who appreciates risk, who likes shows that take chances, I was delighted with the new changes.  The producers stated explicitly that they had been impressed by the realism that had characterized BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and they intended to adopt BSG's aesthetic and its focus on character development rather than the scientific conundrums and plot driven adventures that had characterized the other STARGATE shows.

So the question is, have the changes improved the show?  Is STARGATE UNIVERSE better than the previous series in the franchise?  The answer depends entirely on your preference, but also upon your sophistication as a TV viewer.  I'm sorry of that sounds condescending to critics of the show, but the truth is that the earlier STARGATE shows were enjoyable but spectacularly unchallenging shows.  But if you like shows that are more rather than less complex, STARGATE UNIVERSE will strike you as a dramatic improvement on the earlier shows.  I frankly haven't decided whether or not it is a good show, but unlike the earlier STARGATEs I find myself interested in this one about what will happen next, about what direction the show is going.  SG-1 and ATLANTIS were fine, lightweight entertainment, but I don't think a single episode caused me to think about it afterwards.  But UNIVERSE is more interesting than the other shows, with a more interesting premise.  I will confess that I'm not completely happy with the premise.  The central notion is of a group of people following a gate address to a space ship traveling at faster than light speeds through the universe, stranded because they are unable to dial earth with the gate on the ship.  The idea is somewhat diluted by the unhappy twist that they have a device that allows people to switch bodies, so that a person on the spaceship can inhabit a body on earth, and vice versa.

I'm even less happy with the casting on the show.  Robert Carlyle is superb in the lead role of the brilliant but super cranky and unlikable scientist in charge of the project.  But Justin Louis is not a strong enough actor to carry the role of the military leader on the ship.  Even worse is the character known by many as ""the Angry Black Man,"" Jamil Walker Smith as Ronald Greer.  He tends to mar and ruin just about every scene that he is in.  Many fans of the show enjoy Eli, known by some as ""the Comic Relief Chubby Guy,"" but I find him spectacularly annoying, and one of the least plausible characters ever created on TV.  He has become one of the leaders of the spaceship Destiny because he was recruited because he excelled at playing a computer game (thereby stealing an idea from the eighties SF show THE LAST STARFIGHTER).  For me Eli and Greer come close to destroying the show for me.  I've stuck with the show despite them.  I like the darkness of the show, the bleakness of the situation of the humans on Destiny.  I think if they killed off Eli and Greer, severed the connection to earth via the body swap, and tried to move the story further along, it would be a great series.  My concern at this point is that they are not sure what story they are try to tell.

The series is also interesting for its hybridity.  It is attempting to continue the STARGATE franchise while jettisoning the majority of its unrealistic premises.  I'm not convinced that it is entirely successful, though I'm going to stick it out for a while.  I am definitely enjoying the show at this point, though I'm concerned that the irritating characters will come to dominate the show and that the relative weakness of the series will act as an anchor.  I'm also concerned that they are not going to take the story anywhere interesting.  But I'm an optimist.  I always hope that a show is going to go to better places.  But I will close my review by saying that if you are less a lover of TV SF and more of a lover of quality TV, you will almost certainly find this more interesting that they earlier shows in the STARGATE franchise, and if you loved BSG but hated the earlier STARGATE series, you will more likely enjoy this.

I am not finding very much action, at little too much on the Soap Opera side.
The first few episodes showed promise, but the last few have been fairly boring.
I haven't found many of the characters very endearing, except for David Blue, playing Eli Wallace & Jamil Walker Smith as Ronald Greer.
So far the series seems to be a little too much like Star Trek Enterprise for me.

This is just my opinion, I have been wrong before, and I hope I am wrong this time.
I once said Stargate SG1 would never last, based on the first episodes. Later of course I came to love it and Stargate Atlantis.

But this nonsense the sales idiots came up with -- ""Hey let's jedi mind-trick everybody into thinking half seasons are actually full seasons, and charge them full season prices"" -- is just sad. ~$40 for a half season is $80 per season guys, and people aren't even paying that for shows that have proved themselves far superior.

8378464,1,B002R8JG5I,"I loved the Stargate series.  Until this abomination.  Stargate had always been about heroes, camaraderie, and adventure tinged with humor.  SGU threw out the formula in favor of selfish losers, backstabbing, and boring soap opera awash in sour depression.  Instead of intelligent, capable Amanda Carter, SGU offered Chloe whose greatest asset was the ability to pretty cry.  Every episode was an hour-long of contentious infighting.  Instead of aliens, they fought themselves.  And the end of each episode was unbearable: cue emo music as each character is shown in full-angst mode, and a tear rolls down Chloe's cheek.",1472688000,,620,5.329896907216495
