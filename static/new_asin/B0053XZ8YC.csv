4552675,5,B0053XZ8YC,Wish I could have seen it in theaters. I waited to see it and found out after the fact it only played in a very few number of theaters???????? I wonder how many people are like me who wanted to see it and missed what little opportunity they were given if any. How could it not be a great movie with Jodie Foster directing and starring in it?????!!!!  Cannot wait to buy the DVD so I can finally see it.,1309132800,3,402,4.025
4552676,4,B0053XZ8YC,"AWESOME. I really loved this movie.

This is the first review ive ever wrote and I felt like I really had to. This movie should have a chance for people to see it and the Hollywood elite should let mel work. I have not seen the dvd or blu ray versions of this movie. I actually just left the movies. This movie didn't even come out in a first run theater and was only out for a week before it made to the cheaper theater chains here. being $ 2 tuesday I went to the movies.

when I first saw previews of this movie I really wanted to see it. Im not gonna throw Mel under the bus because of his personal life but as an artist you truly realize why hes MEL GIBSON. A truly gifted  actor w a sense of Burt Reynolds  movie stardom from the 70s. Mel is mel. This movie alot of people wouldnt have been able to pull off but this was meant for Mel.

I don't believe in reviews w spoilers or gives away the movie. Im just goin to say I loved this movie. i felt for the characters. Its does what a movie is supposed to do, leaves you wanting more but completly satisfied. Watch this movie, give it the chance that Hollywood obviously wouldnt, you won't be sorry. one of the best ive seen all year long.

4552678,4,B0053XZ8YC,"This is a film about a man whose marriage is collapsing and his family business is failing. He is about to commit suicide when a beaver puppet on his arm talks him out of it. This becomes his primary form of communication with all those around him. I found The Beaver to be quite enthralling with the effect the puppet had on his familial and business relationships remarkable and the performance of Mel Gibson to be outstanding. I just really liked the puppet character, the accent that was voiced for him by Gibson.  The drama endured by his oldest son, with whom the relationship is strained, I felt was quite interesting. His tale doesn't distract from the Beaver storyline, but adds to it. The film is a fascinating look at how mental illness can damage a man's life and affect those around him.",1306022400,31,800,4.594405594405594

4552693,5,B0053XZ8YC,"I highly recommend this movie to ANYONE who simply doesn't ""get it"" about depression. Depression is NOT a choice. It's a complex medical disorder. People who are depressed DO NOT want you to feel sorry for them. It isn't something you can turn on and off like a light switch. They want to talk about their depression like you want to talk about your cold or flu. They're not broken just because they're depressed. They're just as responsible for themselves like anyone else. They don't want to feel ashamed of their condition. They're depressed not retarded. They're not trying to hurt anyone. And the worst/hardest thing about depression is trying to pretend that you're not. If I could give this movie 6 stars I would. Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster were most excellent in this film. I was impressed with their acting as well as everyone else in the cast. Thumbs up on this film and again I highly recommend this movie to ANYONE who simply doesn't ""get it"" about depression.

4552696,5,B0053XZ8YC,"If the Oscars were objective, Mel Gibson's performance would've garnered him his first Academy Award for best actor. As it happens, the Oscars are inherently political, and The Beaver was released amidst the tape-recording scandal. Because of this, the film was largely ignored, and Gibson wasn't even nominated by the Academy; truly sad, considering the fact that an artist's work should be appreciated for what it is.",1445904000,,419,5.268656716417911

4552722,4,B0053XZ8YC,"A truly original script, I thought, and instead of going for the obvious yucks it takes a much darker, serious turn. Very well directed by Foster, directing a film like this is like dancing: if you doubt what you're doing for a second, you'll look like a fool in short order. But Foster keeps the pedal to the metal the whole way. Great closing shot too.

The only slight weakness to the film is Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Basically it's what we've seen before, most especially in Silver Linings Playbook. (Don't know which film came first.) She gets a passing grade, I guess, but a better performance from her would have made this a terrific film as opposed to very very good. She's got to start locking into her characters -- the way Gibson does here -- as opposed to going through the motions, lovely as those motions are to watch.",1401062400,,840,4.6
4552723,5,B0053XZ8YC,This was an interesting moving with some disturbing parts as well. I am still on the fence on this one.,1397779200,,103,4.2
4552724,5,B0053XZ8YC,"It is about Walter Black, who copes with depression by speaking in a Cockney accent through a beaver hand puppet that he affixes to his left hand and leaves on at all times-whether Walter is in the shower, at the office or having sex. The movie's name and plot generate all sorts of connotations, and none of them suggest what the film actually is: A delicately told, insightful drama about metal illness that stand as one of the biggest, best surprises of 2011.

Something that was not a surprise, however, is how few people found out first-hand what an unexpected marvel they were overlooking. Aside from its name and subject mater, The Beaver had another major road block in its box office outlook: Mel Gibson. So much of an actor's career relies on likability, and the Oscar-winning actor did not help himself in that department by having numerous, widely-covered incidents that suggest he is an angry, homophobic Anti-Semite. Those characteristics have made some people want to have nothing to do with him of his work, no matter what the movie.

If people are ever willing to give Gibson another chance on-scree, The Beaver is the time to do it. Gibson gives on of his best performances as Walter, who opens the movie floating on a raft in a pool but does not look relaxed. Walter looks drained. This is not a man who has thrived in the two years he has worked as head honcho of his dad's toy company, since his father's suicide. He has been worn down by a job for which he was ill-prepared and that has driven him to a state of depression which has alienated his sons Porter and Henry, and left his wife Meredith wondering if the man she loves will ever return to the way he used to be.

Cue the title character, a hand puppet that Walter spots in a dumpster, and, for whatever reason, feels compelled to pick up and put on his hand. It does not stop Walter from trying to hang himself from a shower rod in a hotel after he leaves his house, but, after that suicide attempt doesn't work, Walter's attempt to jump from his hotel balcony is thwarted when the beaver talks to him. Of course, that is Walter talking for the beaver, who, in the aforementioned accent, tell Walter that he is here to save his ""god-damn life."" Foster's direction and Kyle Killen's script treat this very unusual situation with exactly the right tone: What begins with the slightest bit of humour, as Walter cheerfully speaks only through the beaver and Henry delights in spending time with both, quickly becomes far more serious and urgent as the family accepts that this is really happening. Some mild comfort comes from the index card that Walter provides, explaining that the beaver is actually a prescription puppet as recommended by a mental health professional in order to establish a psychological distance between Walter and negative aspects of his personality. Too bad the card is a lie, and Walter actually has not been to see a doctor in more than a year.

As all of this is happening, Porter continues to chart all the ways in which he is like his father in an effort to then eliminate them from his life. While many teenagers feel detached from and annoyed by their parents, Porter hates his father for the things that Porter hates about himself. The adds even more weight to Walter's struggle to regain his mental health and perhaps reestablish a bond with his firs-born. Until the, Porter is occupied by his commissioned task to write a graduation speech for the valedictorian Norah, who feels she does not know what to say or how to say it. The fact that she is beautiful increases Porter's interest in helping her, even though she also agrees to pay him $500 for the job. Though some viewers may doubt the progression of Porter and Norah's relationship, it is actually an intelligently crafted dynamic between a girl with bottled-up emotions and a guy who is bold and articulate enough to help her release a huge weight from her shoulders.

Perhaps it is a stretch that Henry's excitement about the beaver inspires Walter to develop a new, company-saving kid's toy, which in reality might not even be moderately successful. Walter's colleagues' lack of protest about their boss' new style also seems far-fetched. The achievement of The Beaver, however, is not necessarily in crafting an air-tight realistic story. It is about chronicling the way that depression eats away at the self and that person's support system-this is reiterated in that the Blacks' house is literally falling apart, a metaphor that is a bit too obvious. One of the reasons depression can be hard to recognise is the same reason it is hard to portray on screen: This is an illness that is very hard to identify based on physical changes. Yet Gibson and the film dare to acknowledge the anguished emptiness that comes from depression and the lack of easy answers. Meredith tells Walter she needs to know that his old self is going to come back, and she even shows him photos of their 20th anniversary dinner to try to help him remember how happy their lives used to be. The beaver, dressed in a tiny, custom-made tuxedo of his own, is not having it. He reminds Meredith that Walter does not have amnesia, he has depression. It is a sickness that can not be fixed by flipping a switch, but it is one that can be better understood through daring films like The Beaver, whose blissful last scene is a fantasy of the way a person with mental illness, or a person who loves a person with mental illness, dream their lives might someday be again.",1397520000,,5511,4.65400410677618
4552725,5,B0053XZ8YC,"I just cannot get enough of this actor. You can follow his career with all of his movies now on DVD at Amazon.

4552726,4,B0053XZ8YC,"Mel Gibson really pushed the mold when it came to this movie.  Not really my cup of tea but if you're looking for ""out of the ordinary"", you've found it in this one.",1393891200,,165,4.0
4552727,2,B0053XZ8YC,"Let me start by saying that I think Mel Gibson is a good actor (Braveheart) as is Jodie Foster (many films). However, this movie doesn't work for me.

The movie starts out with a very depressed man called Walter Black (get it: a ""Black"" depression) who is sleeping when he isn't drinking. Walter's wife has kicked him out of the house and his older son hates himself and Walter. Then the movie quickly shifts gears to a comedic and positive take on Walter using a beaver puppet to talk to himself and others.  Things seem to go well for a while except he is lying to his wife and family about this being part of his therapy. This is the plot's ""big setup"" for end of the film. Having known people with serious depression I can tell you that no puppet is going to help like this. People with depression also don't split off part of their psyche to ""kick their ass"" like the beaver does with Walter. However, in the film, Walter moves back in and revives his failing business and family life.

Walter's wife discovers that he has been lying about therapy and that he is unable to give the beaver puppet up. She moves out with the kids. This sets up the big climax in which Walter and the beaver fight and finally (Ugh) Walter uses a power saw to cut his hand off to be rid of the beaver. What a morbid, tragic and unnecessary place to take the movie. And then, surprise everything starts to look better for Walter and his family. His estranged son loves him again. Phooey!

This movie doesn't explain its strange plot twists and turns. Why does the beaver turn on Walter? Why does Walter's life come together at the end? Why does his wife accept the beaver, even for a minute. Why doesn't Walter seek help? These issues make a confusing hash of the movie. They and it don't make sense.

The movie shows some positive growth in Walter's older son but not enough to redeem whole mess, IMHO.",1391385600,4,1886,4.392550143266476

I enjoyed it.",1388707200,,268,4.680851063829787
4552730,3,B0053XZ8YC,"Yes, this film has a great cast and is full of sensitive, touching performances.  Although the main character (Mel Gibson playing Walter) spends most of the movie with a beaver puppet on his arm, it is not a film for kids.  Walter is the CEO of a toy company who is desperately depressed and stumbles upon relief in the form of a beaver puppet who can speak for him when he is unable to say those things himself.  He once again plays with his young son and is thoughtful and caring to his wife and older son who is a senior in high school.  They have suffered greatly because of Walter's depression.  Jennifer Lawrence is her typically brilliant self in her role as the older son's friend.

This film shows how one person's illness affects every member of the family and, when it is the head of a large company, every employee.  Depression is to be taken seriously, and it is here...but using a beaver puppet as a possible solution doesn't show enough respect to the mentally ill, and it is uncomfortable to watch.  I'm sure any of us with loved ones who suffer a mental illness are thinking ""we'll take ANYTHING that works"", but watch 1 1/2 hours of a beaver puppet, and you'll see that it is not an answer unless you ARE the CEO of a very successful company and nobody is going to argue with you.  Walter's way of stopping his leaning on the puppet for help is also extreme and unbelievable....and terribly disturbing.  Kyle Killen's writing still has a lot to say, and this is worth watching.",1381536000,,1495,4.463235294117647

The people don't have horns in the center of their head, so it's not THE NEVERENDING STORY and the furniture is real, so it's not THE DARK KNIGHT...most viewers will file this in their heads as a drama and most video stores will put it there.  And it does have a sweet sincere sentimentality to it, more artfully presented than what you can find on the Hallmark Channel, but it's all revolved around a hand that came to life, for some reason(s) related to the hand-owner's severe state of depression.  I really enjoyed this film because it cuts to the chase; it doesn't layout every minute detail of the household the characters live in, it doesn't have meandering scenes that last 5+ minutes each that serve absolutely no purpose.  It's not the greatest film ever by any means, but it's a lot better than most of what I've seen this past year or so, although I think this film actually came out in 2011...anyway...",1373155200,,1116,4.621212121212121

4552734,3,B0053XZ8YC,"Mel Gibson plays the role of a depressed CEO, Walter Black, in this slow paced story that explores acute depression and its impact on family and relationships.

During a severe bout of depression, Walter finds himself in a hotel room attempting suicide that fails miserably. He accidentally discovers a beaver puppet on which he projects his unconstrained emotions.  Needless to say his wife Meredith (Jodie Foster) and teenage son Anton are unable/unwilling to accept this ""charade"", and drama ensues. Gibson creatively voices-over the beaver with his Australian accent to portray Walter Black , a masterpiece if you will.

Mel Gibson and to a lesser extent Jodie Foster carry the slow paced story to a satisfying end.",1372118400,,719,5.181034482758621
4552735,4,B0053XZ8YC,"While most of Hollywood turned its collective backs on Mel Gibson in light of his high profile personal issues, Jodie Foster, his longtime friend and one-time co-star from 'Maverick', stood by him and offered him this plum role.  Gibson is both heart-warming and funny in the role of a man struggling to overcome his own deep depression.  While the plot seems fantastical (how many CEOs would garner such wide-spread approval and positive media attention with a puppet on his hand), the story of a man's journey back from the brink to discover his own value as a husband and father is quite touching.  Director Jodie Foster also  plays his struggling wife in the film with Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence in supporting roles.

The dude is saved from suicide when he developed a split personality that he expresses through the puppet. Children shouldn't watch this film, not for the any bad language or sexual situations but because it is a really messed up movie.

4552751,2,B0053XZ8YC,"For a long time, Mel Gibson's films have reflected his own growing neuroses and obsessions.  Prior to his infamous incident with a cop, his films were becoming excessively violent.  Afterwards, this film, The Beaver, is not a public apology, but rather a form of explanation for his erratic behavior.  Gibson plays Walter Black, a deeply depressed toy company executive who, on the verge of suicide, discovers a beaver hand puppet.  The Cockney-accented toy becomes Walter's voice.  The audience should know beforehand that this film is in no way a comedy, black or otherwise.  It is not a variant of Seth MacFarlane's film ""Ted,"" for example.  Rather, it is a morbid, self-pitying drama with a gruesome climax.

This film is primarily for Gibson fans who want to watch him gnaw on his own obsessions.  It is obvious that Walter's struggle to re-establish a relationship with his wife and children is analogous to Gibson's guilt over leaving his long-time wife and seven children for a Russian gold-digger.  If the pain of a self-destructive narcissist seems like fitting entertainment for you, you will enjoy this film.

4552753,4,B0053XZ8YC,"It was a gutsy call for Jodie Foster to get Mel Gibson back into the acting game after his recent implosions.  But it worked.  Gibson is excellent in this movie playing a mentally ill man.  As his life and family crumble under his depression, Walter Black (Gibson) finds a beaver puppet which he uses to try to get back to real life and his family.  The puppet ""speaks"" (in a Cockney accent) for him and is always with him.  This constant companionship is sometimes eerie, sometimes effective as therapy especially with his younger child, and is sometimes quite funny.  Black showers and makes love to his wife (Jodie Foster) with the beaver on his hand at all times, the absurdity of the situations playing off well against the shadow of his disease.  This is a dark movie with a serious theme, but there is unexpected humor in it, sometimes at the same moment as a bit of that darkness.

The beaver puppet, which has unsettlingly penetrating eyes, helps Black back into his job and family life to some extent.  The movie way overplays the job part, though.  That he could make that kind of comeback with such a ridiculous product and be the apple of the media's eye was a stretch.  But the movie realistically goes on to show that the old illness is still there in Walter Black, as the beaver seems to take on a life of its own.  The ending?  A little hard to believe.  And yet in its own way the beaver is used by Black to make a last stand against his insanity.

This is a movie with a well-written script, quite good acting (particularly Gibson's), and an absorbing mix of tragedy, struggle, and humor.  Entertaining and haunting, it comes close to five stars.",1348704000,,1665,4.518394648829432

He works out a ""solution"" to get back to a ""normal"" life by creating a more confident version of himself in the form of a ""talking"" beaver puppet.

Sounds pretty silly, doesn't it? Well, most of the other people around him think the same thing but you know what? It works. He returns to his life as the CEO of a toy company and he begins to repair things with his wife (who moved out a long time ago) and his children (who are living with the mother).

Jodi Foster, who also directed, plays the wife of the main character, Walter, who is played by Mel Gibson. Gibson, by the way, demonstrates why an ""older"" Hollywood actor like himself is still in demand. He can deliver the goods. Also starring Jennifer Lawrence who is dealing with the loss of her brother to suicide and serves as a romantic interest to Porter, the son of Walter in this picture.

On a deeper level this picture deals with depression and how medicine cannot always deal with it and the fact that some depressed people are going to turn to unorthodox means to cure themselves. It also deals with suicide and the pain the living loved ones go through when something like that happens. How do you deal with grief? How do you channel your rage in a polite society?

And, on a philosophical level it deals with what is happiness and what is normal? The society pretty much determines that factor and this movie suggests society is sometimes wrong.

Thought provoking and probably too deep for the typicaly popcorn eating audiences who don't want anything too serious. Then again, I think the movie people suspected this and thus use the amusing and sometimes humorous beaver to deliver salient points here and there in the film.

The budget for this picture was $21M but it struck out at the Box Office with just a bit over $6M. Here's one audiences missed out on yet again.

4552759,4,B0053XZ8YC,"I'm as shocked as anyone else here who has given this a high rating.  I was pretty certain upon hearing about this movie that it was going to be terrible.  It just looked so stupid.  That said, I'm always game to try anything once, and the reviews were shockingly kind to a film about a man communicating through a puppet.  What I found was a film that was far more profound and moving than expected.  Despite a few slip ups and some confused plot points, this film works remarkably well and delivers the unexpected, which is a good thing from time to time.

`The Beaver' centers on Walter Black, a depressed CEO of a toy company who has swallowed himself up in his shell of a soul and repelled those closest to him thanks to the darkest of depression.  He sleeps, a lot, and barely notices his family to the point where his eldest son despises him, his youngest son feels abandoned and his wife finally kicks him out.  With the light completely snuffed, Walter contemplates suicide, but not before he finds a beaver puppet in a dumpster and for some odd reason decides to take it to the hotel with him.  The beaver then begins to speak through him to him and next thing you know Walter Black has disappeared and is replaced by a British beaver who allows Walter to escape the parts of himself he loathes and replace them with a confidence and sass unbeknownst to him.  While this concept is initially bizarre to those who love him, it eventually allows everyone to escape, until it crosses a line and overstays its welcome and then, well, ""stuff happens"".

As a whole, `The Beaver' is surprisingly astute and really develops its central theme nicely.  This is aided by a phenomenal performance by Mel Gibson.  This guy has gotten a really bad rap (deservedly so as of late) and so it seems like the world roots for him to fail (which is probably why this film did nothing at the box office) but one should be able to separate professional from personal life, and there is no denying that Gibson attacks this performance with a ferocity needed to sell it every step of the way.  He underscores his character's depression with an authenticity that makes you believe his pain.  It actually reminded me a bit of Rourke's turn in `The Wrestler' in that whole `art imitating life' sort of way.  When `The Wrestler' was released it was all about how Rourke was basically playing himself in a way that was therapeutic.  The same is probably true for Gibson here.  This character's free-fall from the brink of sanity is a figurative, fictional representation of Gibson's own mental state.  But, what Gibson does that is so commendable is that he never shies away from baring a piece of himself in every facet of this film, and while the film never victimizes or vilifies Walter and his actions, Gibson finds a way to do both beautifully.  We can feel for the hopeless and helpless state that Walter finds himself and yet we can see the destructive tones that are brought in with the introduction of The Beaver himself.  The way that Gibson contorts his face in sheer bafflement while the words leaving his mouth are so confident and commanding is just sensational, and the way that he comes over to the power of the puppet on his hand is hard to ignore.  I'm stunned at the layers of depth he found in shading this man's mental decline, and while the film's resolution is a tad too brief (why did this have to be so short?) I felt as if Gibson found a way to explain far more than the film was actually willing to tell us.

But as great as Gibson is, and as intriguing and compelling as the plot is, there are some weaknesses.  The side plot involving the toy company and the beaver inspired toy is a tad too obvious, and the plot revolving around Black's son and his love interest is unnecessary.  This film had a chance to maintain focus and instead it veered in the wrong ways, and when you have a running length that is under two hours (it is barely an hour and a half) then you need to keep sharp focus so as to get a fuller impact.  The graduation speech that results from the love-story is also cringe-worthy in its obviousness.

Still, this is a much stronger film than one may initially expect and so I highly recommend checking it out!",1344988800,9,4237,4.490221642764015
4552760,2,B0053XZ8YC,"A depressed CEO of a toy company accidentally finds a way to communicate with others through a hand puppet he found in a dumpster. While his younger son and estranged wife, as well as his company's employees, welcome his change, his older son, afraid of becoming like his father, just doesn't like it.

Mel Gibson plays the depressed CEO Walter Black. Jodie Foster is his alienated wife Meredith. Anton Yelchin is Walter's elder son Porter, who writes term papers for other students for money; Jennifer Lawrence is Norah, the valedictorian who asks Porter to write a speech for her. Their budding romance is just a subplot, but seems more believable than the main story.

The film's premise about the troubled man with a hand puppet is already something hardly credible, especially when Mel Gibson's character goes through the change so quickly. When the beaver hand puppet started 'speaking' in a Cockney accent, I stopped caring. Is it an allegory or something? Is there any subtexts underlying the apparently incredible storyline? I know the hand puppet idea does not have to be psychologically valid. In ""The Beaver"" it serves as a plot device - a device of which potential is never explored.

""The Beaver"" is a drama, not a comedy. If it is a comedy, it is a dark one. We know Jodie Foster (who also directs) is not known for comedic roles. But as a drama, like in her works as director (""Little Man Tate"" and ""Home for the Holidays""), something is not quite right with the film, of which characters (including the ""Beaver""), well-acted as they are, feel very distant. Despite the drastic thing that happens in the latter half of the story, we feels emotionally detached. Is that really necessary?

The film's uneven script does not allow us to get to know the characters. We see Mel Gibson turning in compelling performances, but we do not meet the person Walter Black. We are fascinated by his acting, not by the character's spiritual journey. The film is sincere and intelligent, and has a unique concept, but that alone is not enough to draw us into the story it tells.",1343433600,8,2078,4.763888888888889

When confronted with the diagnosis it was a shock to the system.  It was rough going at first but after years of therapy and, yes, medication I'm a fully functioing member of society.  There are good days and bad days but the good outweigh the bad.  With that confessional I viewed ""The Beaver"" with special interest.  Would it be sensitive to the plight of millions of depression sufferers or would it be exploitative or, even worse, get it wrong?  Happily the film gets it right.

Walter finds a hand puppet in the trash and a light switch goes off.  With this inanimate object Walter can project self confidence that he couldn't being himself.  Worlds open up to Walter but is the puppet the answer or merely a mask for his self loathing?  Gibson is brilliant here showing the many hues of Walter.  The puppet, simply known as the Beaver, can emit a chipper demeanor and you can't take your eyes off him.  That said, look at the man behind the curtain and you see a sad confused individual.  Kudos go out as well to Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence as two smart teens who have to bear the slings and arrows that life has dealt them.  Foster, who also directed the film, keeps the proceedings at an even keel fully aware that the subject of her film reverberates with more than you can imagine.

There's a number of things I could say that I didn't like about the film but I'll focus on the main reasons I didn't like it.  SPOILER ALERT

I got the feeling toward the end of the movie that whoever wrote it got so far, and things were going ok, and they didn't know how to end it, so they somehow came up with a bad ending.

Even from the preview, we know that the film is about depression.  I think most people are interested in the subject and how it was portrayed in the preview.  The film moves fast enough to the relief of the beaver.  It's an interesting idea, but one that is not fully explored.  Finally, things get worse and for the most part are left there.  We're left with a solution that doesn't give the characters any substantial relief, and the film ends with a rather pitiful attempt at displaying this.

This film just seemed to be one person's nod at personal demons and how they taunt us all.  Unfortunately, the message and story got of the film get lost in the writer's bleak outlook and leave the viewer with a feeling of ""ummmm....."" at the film's end.

I guess I just don't go for the notion that ""we're all messed up but at least we're all in this together"" and no real solutions to our problems.",1334016000,4,1302,4.247967479674797
4552767,4,B0053XZ8YC,"When I first heard that Mel Gibson was going to star in a movie where he played a man who talked through a hand puppet of a beaver I thought good for him, another comedy under his belt. It wasn't until I watched the film that I found the movie was only comedic in moments but was actually a deep drama focusing on one man's method of dealing with depression, something I think more and more people are experiencing these days. And I also thought it was much better than I had anticipated.

In THE BEAVER, Gibson stars as Walter Black, the owner of a toy company handed down to him by his father. Walter is in the midst of a deep depression that nothing seems to cure. Therapy, fads, pills, nothing works. His youngest son Henry (Riley Stewart) doesn't see most of the problems, his teen son Porter (Anton Yelchin) is in that teen phase where he hates his father and dreads becoming like him (to the point he puts post it notes on the ceiling of his room of things his dad does so he won't do them) and his wife Meredith (Jodi Foster who also directed) is so frustrated that she kicks him out.

With nowhere to go, Walter ditches part of what he's taken with him and while looking in the dumpster finds a hand puppet of a beaver. For some odd reason, he takes it with him and checks into a hotel. At his lowest point, Walter then attempts suicide by hanging himself from a shower curtain rod which fails miserably. Dragging the rod by his necktie, he then stands on the ledge of his room and tries to jump, falling backward onto the balcony. And then the beaver starts talking to him.

Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a puppet that's alive and talks. Walter's lips move and the words come from his mouth, but to him it IS the beaver speaking to him. And the beaver tells him he is here to fix his life.

The next thing you know Walter is in the garage working on a project with his youngest son and passing along a note to his wife telling her that this is a new therapy suggested by his last therapist. He does the same at work and while it seems strange to see his lips moving but getting the impression it's the beaver talking, everyone adjust. His life gets better.

Things at the toy factory go great and he launches a new toy line based on...the beaver. Things at home get better too as he works his way back into his family's good graces. With the exception of Porter who has his own issues to deal with. These include writing fake assignments for fellow students and being hired by the school's prettiest girl to write the valedictorian speech for her. The two try to open up to one another tentatively but still the both have something to hide.

And that's the thing about this movie. It's not about a man with a talking beaver puppet on his hand. It's about people and the problems they have in real life and how they deal with them. Some might use a puppet while others hide in a shell and bang their head into a wall and yet some hold secrets and feelings deep inside with a fear of sharing them with anyone. All of these emotions come into play in this story. And the solutions that each character finds to their problems vary from violence to hear rendering.

Foster has done a great job of assembling a cast that seems fit for their roles. She does great as a woman concerned for her husband but trying to do the right thing for her family as well. Yelchin is great as a troubled teen searching for himself and fearful of becoming the one thing he witnesses as being worse off than he is. And Gibson turns in a dynamic performance as a man trapped inside of a deep pain that he can not share with anyone, that offers no release and that could end up killing him.

THE BEAVER is a film that will not be nominated for any awards (though Gibson's performance should be) and didn't last long at the box office. And that's sad since the topic of depression and dealing with it is one that needs discussed. One can only hope that this film which offers fear, depression, the feeling of hopelessness, redemption and love will find its audience on DVD.",1332806400,,4061,4.313237221494102

Jodie Foster is a beautiful soul and Mel Gibson is her hand-puppet in this gorgeous and touching film that will make any feeling person laugh and cry. If you've ever had a family member or close friend who truly suffered from deep depression, or if you've been there yourself, you know how brutal it can be. Foster and Gibson clearly do, and most especially screenwriter Kyle Killen, who produced a true work of art in The Beaver.

His script, Foster's feel, and Gibson's complete immersement into his role and puppet gave me a cinematic experience of unexpected depth and power. There are moments here that just touched me to the core. From moment one, there's that rare and wonderful feeling of being in a real world, not a fake Hollywood film, yet there's also a lightness and wry sense of humor that this subject needs so much. Movies about depression aren't usually much fun, but The Beaver delivers both real humor and oddly powerful pathos, and when it was over I really felt like I'd been through something. That's good art.

All the performances are very good to great, and you can tell everybody knew they were making a unique and special film. It just kind of sneaks up on you, scene by scene, and before you know it you're feeling way more than you expected. I'd hate to use spoilers so I'll just say that some very unexpected things happen that are emotionally wrenching and so weird that they just seem true to life.

Gibson is brilliant in a role that could easily be ridiculous. To bring the sadness and odd sense of fun the script calls for was no mean feat, and you can imagine many actors in this role but very few doing a better job. The man has matured in every way and that's clear to see on the screen. Same with Foster, who one day will get credit for a career full of intelligent and loving choices.

It's the love that makes The Beaver work as well as it does, and I urge anybody who knows what depression can do to a family to watch this, preferably alone at night so you can really let it all sink in.

A very rare and unique film. Highly recommended.",1328832000,,2090,4.4296875
4552770,5,B0053XZ8YC,"Despite failing to achieve success at the box office last year, this movie is truly worth watching!
People may be boycotting Mel Gibson's work because of his recent behavior and resultant tabloid notoriety, but he does deliver as an actor in this film.
His portrayal of Walter Black, 'a hopelessly depressed individual' is heartbreakingly sincere and incredibly moving.
After failing at every attempt to ameliorate the symptoms of his persistent depression, things fall apart for Walter when his wife Meredith (aptly portrayed by Jodie Foster) asks him to leave the house. After an emotional night of heavy drinking he awakes to find that a beaver puppet might represent the breakthrough solution to all his problems. He begins to communicate through the beaver puppet with his family and employees, but the breakthrough success he sees in 'creating a psychological distance between himself and the negative aspects of his personality' subtly begins to turn on Walter. As the beaver begins to develop a personality of its own, the viewer suspects that this 'breakthrough' more closely resembles a manic break that leaves Walter to lose more and more control over his actions. Events take a painful toll on his wife and son's, especially on his older son Porter, who not only loses the last bit of respect for his father, but who also begins to get into trouble himself. Meredith Black patiently goes along with her husband's latest 'quirk' until she realizes that things have gone completely out of control. Jodie Foster convincingly portrays a woman desperate to 'get back the man she loves' from the abyss his depression has created. The scenes of the couple interacting while the ever present beaver puppet begins to assume the confidence and leadership that Walter was lacking will often make you chuckle and wonder to what lengths you might be willing to go to yourself.
It might be wrong to categorize this movie as a comedy. It does have it's moments, but after all the underlying message is that mental illness is a serious issue that can place a heavy burden on families and that a ridiculous quirk born of a deeply depressed mind could in reality be the mania that finally destroys the person who welcomed it at first.
In my opinion, this movie is absolutely worth watching and neither the trailer, nor the box office scores do it justice.

4552775,4,B0053XZ8YC,"Poor Jodie Foster.  As this film is released last spring, her friend and co-star Mel Gibson jumps back into the news with more tabloid exploits.  Pretty much the whole world is now down on Gibson, even to the point of not wanting to ever watch his movies again.  Throw in a really stupid title certain to draw chuckles for its unintended double meaning.  Then we have a puppet.  Yes it's a beaver puppet, but still.  Then leave it up to the distributor to pitch the film as a comedy.  This is no comedy and if you can get past the idea of a rodent puppet always attached to the hand of Walter who is in deep depression, it actually is a very good movie.

Walter (Gibson) is the head of a previously successful small toy company that is quickly heading toward bankruptcy.  We don't really know what the cause of Walter's depression is but we can assume the company's downfall is at least partially to blame.  After a failed suicide attempt Walter finds the discarded hand puppet which begins to talk to him.  Actually, it's Walter talking back to himself with the puppet as his alter ego.  Yes, this sounds crazy and frankly it is.  Still, Gibson pulls it off, switching back and forth from an American accent (Walter) to a spot-on version of Michael Caine (The Beaver).  He ranges from normal to manic and suicidal.  He's very good!

Walter becomes dependent on The Beaver, but can otherwise act rationally.  His wife (Foster) puts up with this for a while because she believes it is changing her husband for the better and that this is a short term therapy suggested by a doctor.  There is a subplot involving Walter's teenage son played by Anton Yelchin and a beautiful fellow student played by Jennifer Lawrence.  Each has their own set of issues.  This acting couple team up again this year in ""Like Crazy.""  I didn't find much amusing in this well made film.  It's too bad it has been mostly overlooked.

The Blu ray version has an excellent picture surprisingly full of color.  The sound via DTS-HD is solid but mostly upfront.  There are a couple deleted scenes narrated by Foster.",1324339200,2,2088,4.578378378378378

4552778,3,B0053XZ8YC,"It has been many years since actress Jodie Foster had directed a film.  Her 1991 directorial debut ""Little Man Tate"" and her 1995 comedy ""Home for the Holidays"" were her last two.

But this time around Foster takes on a psychological comedy/drama with ""The Beaver"".

The film revolves around the Black family, Walter Black (played by Mel Gibson) is a toy executive who is clinically depressed and is literally has withdrawn himself from life.

May it be trauma or a chemical imbalance, Black feels that going to a psychiatrist, repeating the same pill taking routine and thinking life is absolutely terrible, despite having a successful career and a loving family.

But his depression has taken its toll on his family.

His wife Meredith (played by Jodie Foster) who feels that her husband has been away for the last two years has focused her energy on her engineering career and developing a roller coaster with her Tokyo clients; their eldest son Porter (played by Anton Yelchin) is a college student who is paid to write reports for other students but also has been cataloging the similarities of his dad's depression with his own and their younger son Henry (played by Riley Thomas Stewart) wants his father healthy again and while at school, is often bullied.

Needless to say, the Black family has become quite dysfunctional to the point that Meredith has no choice but to have Walter move out of the house.

Walter checks into a hotel and throws away nearly everything except a beaver hand puppet.  One day as he tries to kill himself but is unsuccessful.  He ends up injuring himself instead and knocking himself out cold.  When he wakes up, he is awaken by the beaver puppet known as ""The Beaver"", an alternate personality which allows Walter to communicate with people.

With the Beaver, Walter lets the people he communicates with know that it is a way for him to clinically help him through severe depression.  Walter tells his wife that it was recommended to him by his psychiatrist.

And immediately, The Beaver helps bring Walter back from the darkness as he is able to reconnect with his son and his wife and also the people of the toy company that he runs.

Walter through the Beaver is able to make a return back to society and also come up with a brilliant toy idea bringing the highest profits for his ailing toy company but also establishing the bond with his family.

But how long will Walter have to depend on the beaver and what happens when the beaver starts to take control of his life?

VIDEO:

""The Beaver"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  Picture quality is very good, definitely feels as if there was a cooling filter applied to make things a bit more blue but it does fit the emotional atmosphere of the film.  Colors are vibrant, black levels are very deep and I didn't notice any speckles or artifacting.

For the most part, the picture quality for ""The Beaver"" is very good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Beaver"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Espanol Dolby Digital 5.1.  The lossless soundtrack is primarily front and center-channel driven.  Dialogue is crystal clear but sometimes there were moments where I needed to have subtitling on as I felt I was missing some dialogue during conversations.  There is a good amount of ambiance featured through the surround channels.  For example, when Porter is at school, you can hear the crowds at school through the surround channels.  Also, during Porter banging his head on the wall can be heard.

For the most part, the lossless soundtrack is adequate for this type of film and for the most part audio quality is very good.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Beaver"" comes with the following special features:

  Audio Commentary - Featuring an in-depth commentary by director Jodie Foster.
  Deleted Scenes - (4:52) Featuring two deleted scenes: Role Play and Puppet Pull with optional commentary by director Jodie Foster.
  Everything is Going to Be OK - (12:06) Director Jodie Foster talks about the film, the characters and the cast.  The cast talk about their involvement in the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Beaver"" is an intriguing film that tends to blend in comedy with psychological drama and sometimes it works (if more as a comedy ala ""The Cable Guy"") but as a serious film, especially about depression, some may feel it's a bit farfetched as a man would become internationally popular because he holds a puppet to deal with his severe depression.

In this day and age, depression affects a lot of people and many get treatment or take the medicine needed to help them deal with the illness.  ""The Beaver"" in the other hand, while interesting, tries to show a juxtaposition of the main character Walter, as he deals with his sickness via the alternate personality he has created.  And to see the other side via his son Porter, who worries that he may have the same sickness that his father had.

And there was one scene that was very important was that His father and his father and his father's father had the illness as well.  So, there is that connection of family history of depression.

But ""The Beaver"" is a film that I felt was underdeveloped.  Listening to the audio commentary, Jodie Foster mentioned of having to decide if Walter's depression should be explained.  I felt that for many people, severe depression for those not familiar with it, may be thought as how one feels for a temporary amount of time and not thinking that it is a serious illness that must be treated.  The film needed to show that destination of pain and withdrawal but the opening skims through it too quickly.  Yes, we know he's depressed but viewers needed to know how badly it has been right off the bat.

The other storyline revolves around Porter and Norah, the girl he likes.  We know that Walter's family has been affected by his severe depression and for his son, not having his father but also for Porter having to worry about having depression and cataloging the similarities that he has with his father, it's an understandable storyline.  But what is a bit off is more of him trying to help Norah, which involves her deceased brother.  And I felt that this emotional withdrawal on her end is understandable but once again, a character's storyline that was underdeveloped.

I felt the screenplay needed a bit more work and it does hurt the movie.  But I will say that it's saving grace was Mel Gibson.  We know that Jodie Foster is an awesome actress but at the time this film was released, Mel Gibson was no doubt seen as the public enemy in Hollywood because of the situations going on in his personal life.  Does anyone want to see a Mel Gibson movie after all that has happened to him offscreen?  Needless to say, he may not be a fan favorite any longer but he is still one heck of an actor and his performance made this film work.

It's great to see Jodie Foster back as a director.  She is one of the most highly experienced talents in the world today that has been working in the industry since she was in a child and has starred in many box office hits and critically-acclaimed films. But while the storyline is intriguing, mixing comedy and psychological drama is not an easy thing to do, especially when it becomes more serious.  But I think it's the challenge that probably led her to direct the film.

And as for the Blu-ray, it's great to have an audio commentary and featurettes that showcase Foster the director as opposed to the actress.  Picture quality is very good as with the audio quality as well.

While ""The Beaver"" may not be a box-office hit, overall ""The Beaver"" is an intriguing film with its solid moments of wonderful acting courtesy of both Gibson and Foster.  While not a great film and has its problems with its underdeveloped screenplay, it's still a film worth checking out.",1323993600,,7874,4.702702702702703

However, with some funny moments, Mel Gibson spends most of the movie with his hand inside a beaver puppet, this movie is very touching. I almost want to go so far as to say that it's beautiful...but that may be pushing things a bit too far.

Gibson plays Walter Black. A man suffering from depression. With everything falling apart around him, he finds solace in a beaver puppet and begins to live a double life as the beaver.

Foster plays his wife and there's Anton Yelchin (Star Trek) as his oldest son who wants nothing to do with his father yet continues to find similarities between the two.

This film was bamboozled by Gibson's off-screen antics with his ugly comments and recorded phone conversations. But I think that ""drama"" adds a layer to this movie.

No one should doubt that he is a fantastic actor. He is terrific in this movie. As the beaver, he picks up an accent that sounds exactly like Ray Winstone (Beowulf).

Maybe it was just the season of when I watched this film, but I thought it was anything but a flop.

Walter is free falling into the darkness when he is ""rescued"" by a beaver puppet that talks for him and takes over his persona. It sounds like the stuff of a troublesome nightmare that is best forgotten.  It sounds like something that, if turned into a movie, would be shockingly bad.  But, largely due to a bravura performance by Gibson, this film is gut-wrenchingly powerful.

Jodie Foster directs. She also convincingly plays Walter's long-suffering wife.  It seems that she has had quite enough of Walter's paralyzing depression, but she still remembers the happier years early in the marriage. Perhaps her wedding vows, the better or worse part, actually mean something.  She also hopes Walter can come around because of their two sons, who are both greatly impacted by Walter's illness.

I was right! This movie had me in from the beginning and kept me thinking throughout. Having suffered depression myself for a long time I could totally relate to Mel Gibson's performance, and wished I had a beaver to do my talking for me!
I think this movie should be watched by all those who know of depression and of friends or family who suffer depression. I believe the word ""depression"" is a misnomer for this condition/disease. People who have never felt it are apt to brush it off as an excuse, but for those of us who struggle to get out of bed every day it is very real, and my response to those who don't believe in depression as an illness is to say, if you think it is so darn easy to just ""cheer up"" don't you think I would have by now?!! It's not like one chooses to feel that way.
The characters in this family gave a very real and believable interpretation of the script and Mel Gibson, dare I say it, was superb in this film and made me remember that he really is a good actor. Jodie Foster, as always, was brilliant in her role as the long suffering wife.

He is a dead man walking - not living, but existing in a dark place... until he finds a hand-puppet in a dumpster. The puppet is named `The Beaver' and it becomes a part of Walter, helping him to feel alive again. The Beaver helps to make good things happen, but this puppet also causes more trouble in a family already dealing with way more than they can handle.

I didn't see this movie in the theater (no particular reason; just didn't go) and I do not own the DVD or Blu-ray. Amazon Instant Video is how I chose to view The Beaver. Mel Gibson gives a believable performance. I felt so bad for Walter Black, especially during the scene in the restaurant with his wife, Meredith(Jodie Foster). There was also a scene that I'm guessing was supposed to be sad and it was, but Gibson also made it a bit funny even though what was taking place wouldn't be funny at all in real life. And Walter wasn't the only character who was in pain. His oldest son was dealing with his own issues - showing that depression can be hereditary - and there was another character who, at first sight, I never expected to be hurting inside. The storyline with the teens was as interesting as Walter's storyline and it was thought-provoking. In fact, the entire movie gives the viewer a lot to think about.

4552793,1,B0053XZ8YC,"Okay; here's what I was thinking, going into this movie.  Mel Gibson's character is depressed with life and it affects his work and family.  He finds this beaver puppet in the trash, and he lets his subconscious do the talking for him through the puppet.  He motivates himself by talking through the puppet, and while people view it as kind of quirky, he becomes a better person, wins his family back and gets his life back on track to the point where he doesn't need the puppet anymore.  So he tosses it in the trash, symbolizing that he is letting go of the thing that helped him cross the bridge of his former depressed self to the new and improved self.  Then someone else who is down on their luck finds it, and we get the idea that the puppet improves the lives of those who happen to come across it.  This movie?  Not so much.

Look; I'm not saying every movie should be typical Hollywood, happy-go-lucky with a sun-shiny ending where everything turns out perfectly and roses and flowers and all is right with the world.  I enjoy movies that are challenging and daring, and don't mind if a movie doesn't end on a happy note - just make the journey pleasant and satisfying.  Let's not confuse dysfunctional with challenging - this movie was bad.  The kind of ""I can't believe I just sat through this movie, and this was the outcome??"" bad.

I took a chance on this movie, thinking that it might be some pleasantly surprising jem of a dark comedy (like ""World's Greatest Dad"") and that maybe the public got it wrong.  Nope; the public was spot on and I see why this movie flopped.  Bad, bad, bad.

In all fairness, the actors all gave fine performances.

This is a film about how each of the family circle of characters deal with what life throws their way...be it a profound mental illness, the loss of a loved one or the circumstance and impact of connection to such individuals.

Presented in a highly quirky yet effective manner, this film chronicles the break down of a significantly depressed Mel Gibson and the impact he has on those around him.  In the end, what saves each from their own self-imposed hell is the constant for each, the love of another.

The subject is presented as black humor for so dark is the depression of Walter, Mel Gibson, that to present this film as a drama would depress all in kind.  The plot is somewhat uneven but clearly mirrors the roller coaster that is the Beaver, clinical depression.

Mel Gibson helps carry the film with outstanding acting.  The other actors present credible efforts but are upstaged by Mr. Gibson.  The real star of the film, however, is the personification of Walter's mental despair, The Beaver.  For it an Academy nomination is much deserved.

This is a must see film for all with at least an ounce of intellect and/or sensitivity.  For the rest, I am sure the film will be quite depressing.",1315440000,,1219,4.649532710280374
4552795,4,B0053XZ8YC,"I followed this film before its theatrical release.  I read of Foster's struggle to retain backing for the project after Mel Gibson's casting, breaking his essential Hollywood blacklisting because of his inappropriate comments to a police officer while under the influence.  Gibson didn't work for almost five years.  However, Foster was firm with her casting, reportedly went a more indy route to secure financing, and fought for her choice of actor.  After the film was made, communications with Gibson's girlfriend became public, generating more bad publicity for the actor which delayed the release of the film.  The film premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival.  The film was not given wide release, but went the art-house circuit after disappointing early box-office.  Made for $21 million, the box office revenues were under a million.  It was both Gibson's and Foster's poorest box office showing.

That said, I LIKED the film!  It is a strange movie.  As Foster comments in the DVD extras, there is a balance between humor and family drama.  The dark subject matter of depression is nevertheless one with which many families have had to battle; so I hope ""The Beaver"" finds its audience.  We never really get a sense of what triggers Walter Black's depression, other than the family genetic history that similar things happened with his father and grandfather.  As Walter Black, Mel Gibson's face is weathered and worn, laden with the cares of depression.  He fills each moment of screen time with clear, often unexpected choices.

American audiences seem to do well with superheroes, raunchy comedies and horror movies.  When dealing with real family situations that get complex, audiences can have trouble knowing how to react.  This film does have humor, such as Walter's attempted suicide that had me laughing as he marched to the hotel balcony.  It also has the very serious issues that Jody Foster's Meredith Black reflects extremely well, loving her husband very much, but also having to make decisions that protect her children.  But the box office returns do not mean that this isn't a good film.  I think it is.

Other cast performances are also amazing.  Anton Yelchin from ""Hearts in Atlantis,"" ""Star Trek"" and currently in theatres with ""Fright Night"" is riveting.  He shows the teenage rebelliousness, self-centeredness, balanced with a tremendous decency with his mother and brother and kids at school.  Jennifer Lawrence whose Oscar-nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone"" broke her career wide open does a superb job as high school valedictorian Norah, whose family was also affected by a suicide.  The young son Henry played by Riley Thomas Stewart is so sweet, you just want to give the boy a hug.  Cherry Jones, who has won a Tony on Broadway for ""The Heiress"" and is considered a consummate theatrical actress, does a great job as the vice president of Walter's toy company.

""The Beaver"" requires focus and concentration from its audience.  It is witty, intelligent, and well-directed.  Enjoy!",1315440000,2,3035,5.122199592668024
4552796,5,B0053XZ8YC,"Beavers turn out to be pretty darn clever creatures.

How else to explain the fact that these rodents so intent on taking over the world were able to hijack a Hollywood blockbuster? What better way to tear down humanity but from the inside, like a Trojan horse -- or a beaver puppet?

And what better way to get cozy with these rather dim-witted homo sapiens than through their sexual organs? This is why the interspecies menage-a-trois is such a key scene in ""The Beaver."" Just breed your way in and take over.

But alas, it is not to be. For, though homo sapiens could well prove to be powerless to the wiles of said dam-builders, Mel Gibson is actually a neanderthal, a mere medulla oblongata on legs, and as such cannot be kept in check by this wannabe master race. All is well as, once again, Mel, the Great Martyr of the Big Screen, sacrifices himself for our conveniences.

4552797,3,B0053XZ8YC,"I should have enjoyed this more - and for what it's worth, there are many strong elements here.  I won't go into any synopsis or dwell on the many fine performances (all were strong, including supporting cast)...it is the elements that go into movie making - the lighting, cutting, script, pacing and tone - which were uneven or lacking in this movie.  I'm going to throw in my two cents about why and how the movie could have been improved.

The primary strength of any  premise is often also its weakness and this is especially true in a problematic or unusual thematic concept, such as a man speaking through a beaver puppet.  How do you set the tone?  Where are the mines in the field?  Here they missed because they couldn't pitch the tone with enough care nor did they carry it through the entire movie.  Instead, it was uneven and this leads to the viewer feeling sort of queasy or uneasy.  It's sort of a bumpy ride, with enjoyable moments and moments where you sort of want to cringe, because the handling of the material is rather heavy-handed or off-putting.  Here's my explanation of why this might have happened and how they could have fixed it.

The movie starts with a tone that is at once dry and a little distancing, such as in a semi-documentary, combined with a hefty dose of deadpan  and off-beat black humor.  The dry distancing tone was a mistake - it's the wrong ""spice"" if you will for the dish.  Since black humor is also distancing, what happens is that it gets kind of hard to spontaneously respond emotionally to the characters.  We want to, so we ""try"" to get engaged and this creates a tension that the movie could do well without.  It has been suggested by another reviewer here that the film could have used more energy and more goofyness.  I tend to agree, this would have warmed it up a lot.  The movie feels cold.

I feel that a foreign director and writer would have done a better job with this type of a film - they have the humanity and the levity, the sparklingly light touch that would have been welcome.  We see it in the scene when Black engages his company and re-takes the helm - with the help of his Beaver persona.  That scene crackles and has life.  Many other scenes could have benefited from this treatment.  For instance, when the charming little kid is in the backseat of his mother's car and relates his experience of being bullied, it is done in a straight-forward fashion that makes us squirm, rather than relate.  It is a tonal misstep that could have been avoided with a careful re-working of the script.  Such calculations are necessary to avoid the ""minefields"" in any concept piece.

The mines in this film are clearly the dryness and the distance we feel and the discomfort that creates - it just doesn't work for the subject matter.  Maybe if we'd showed the kid getting tossed into the dumpster and the teacher fishing him out and calling the mother in for a consultation.  It would have worked better and had a little more room for some humor and some revealing character moments that wouldn't be distancing.

Another thing that a European director would have known to avoid is what I call ""porn lighting"".  This is that reprehensible, all-too-ubiquitous use of brightness in the lighting, where there no shadows and everything in the camera frame is balanced and crisp.  We do not experience our world this way.  It is false, plastic, rigid, conventional and lacking in all art.  If there is anyone from Hollywood out there reading this, please, for the love of God, just say no, like you would to a drug pusher.  It's disgusting.  It's crappy.  And it ruins the tone of many pictures.  Plus it looks absolutely cookie-cutter.  The few scenes in the film where the lighting is dim and grainy are far, far superior to any of the other scenes, and more memorable, just by this sensitive use of lighting.  The film suffers greatly from a very unbalanced use of proper lighting effects.  The last film the porn lighting worked in was Poltergeist, and it was effective because it was an ironic undertone central to the theme of the movie!  Lighting techniques set tone and tell your story.  Forget this at your peril.

The last thing that mires the film, bogs it down and is irritating to the viewer is the sub=plot.  It isn't bad and I found the characters believable and engaging.  The handling of the subplot was simply not deft enough.  That poor teenage boy keeps popping up like a spam bot, over and over until you want to take an axe and chop him out of the film, which is unfortunate, because you like him and you like the subplot, but it isn't handled sensitively.  Sub=plots must not be intrusive to the primary story-line.  Another rule you forget at your peril.

To tell this element of the story better would have been as simple as re-writing the scenes to approximately one-half as many of them, and excising a lot of the lines, letting the physicality of the two people tell the story.  Instead what we get is a B-plot climax reminiscent of the old ABC After School Special, preachy and contrived.  (Yes, I know, some of them were really good and won awards - but you know what I'm getting at here.)

Since the primary character is extremely physical (one of Mel Gibson's major talents is sustained physical comedy - he's superb in his command of his instrument and fascinating to watch), the part where the kid is banging his head against the wall and where he finally crashes through the exterior is a fine symbolic and fitting parallel to the primary tale.  Too much talking (and screen time) ruins this balance.  Cutting his scenes by half (or more) and cutting his lines in those remaining scenes by half (like poetry rather than prose, very spare) would have nailed it.  The movie would also have then had a shorter running time, which might have left the possibility open to write some more scenes showing the back-story - another thing this movie desperately lacked and which placed it in mid-air, instead of on solid ground.

Okay.  There's my two cents.  Hope you enjoyed reading it and I hope it helps some people decide whether or not to check it out and watch it.",1314748800,3,6150,4.579670329670329

4552802,1,B0053XZ8YC,"I may need a beaver puppet myself to find the proper words to describe how much hatred this movie inspired in me. I hated everyone and everything in it, except Mel Gibson. I even hated the continuity person for making a huge error.

In the ""making of"" feature on the disc, Jodie Foster talks of ""wit and humor"" several times. I didn't see an iota of either in the entire movie.

The worst error in this movie is that there is a crucial piece of information missing from this story: How Walter Black's (Mel Gibson) family changed from what we presume were loving relationships to the horrible loveless people shown in the movie. If his wife and oldest son were always so hateful, it's no wonder he went crazy. The whole family is very sick; Walter is just the designated patient. What happened to bring things to the crisis point?

But everything is this movie is so very trite and unreal that it probably isn't worth the time I'm wasting writing about it. Long before the movie was over, I found myself hating every character in it, except Gibson's. And the little kid, but that character is also very unreal; he should not have been so well adjusted, since the dysfunctionality he had to live with was not merely Walter's.

Maybe the movie would have been a bit better if they had jettisoned the boring, stupid, and unnecessary subplot about the oldest son and the cheerleader. Both are so very trite, especially the cheerleader. The tortured soul that can only express herself through graffiti--puh-leeze. The DVD should come with a barf bag. Probably two.

Gibson's performance is great and he plays the only sympathetic character in the movie--up until the end anyway, when the movie becomes rushed and silly, and the story suddenly takes him from being the surviving victim of a loveless family into self-mutilation.

There is so much wrong with this movie that I wouldn't even recommend seeing it solely for Gibson's performance, fine as that was.",1314316800,12,1953,4.7463126843657815

Is the film sad at times? Yes. Is it just a cute hand puppet? Definitely not. Does the film make you laugh at times? We did. But it also made us cry, and cringe, and think.
We both agree that Mel Gibson does an outstanding job acting in this film. Jodie Foster, Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence were also fascinating to watch, especially Yelchin, who portrays Gibson's troubled oldest son in the film.

4552805,3,B0053XZ8YC,"Jodie Foster's THE BEAVER is, among many other things, a very intriguing film.  A middle-aged man suffering from depression, Walter Black (a very nuanced performance by Mel Gibson) is at the end of his rope (or, in an uncomfortably-funny scene, his tie).  His oldest son despises him, his wife can't understand him, and his employees don't respect him.  Thrown out of his house, Walter discovers a Beaver puppet in a Dumpster.  After a drunken night that ends poorly, Walter's psyche slowly surrenders to that of the Beaver (who features a voice eerily similar to Gibson's EDGE OF DARKNESS costar Ray Winstone).  At first, Black's family (and the world) welcomes this upbeat change.  But things slowly turn for the worst, as they generally do, and Black must choose between himself and the Beaver.  Assuming he even has a choice anymore.

The acting here is fairly solid.  Gibson is reliably admirable.  Normally, I am in favor of disassociating an actor from his public identity; art for art's sake and all that.  But Gibson's reputation actually lends a sense of poignancy to his performance, as Black takes the Beaver public on ""The Today Show.""  Foster is strong as Black's wife; Anton Yelchin is superb as his oldest son, though he's wasted in an unnecessary subplot involving a straight-A student with doubts (an equally fantastic Jennifer Lawrence).  This subplot is indicative of the film's major flaw (hence the three stars): like Walter Black, the film is suffering something of an identity crisis.  Dark comedy or poignant self-discovery flick?  It meanders back and forth, ultimately settling on the latter (there's a gripping climax, but the denouement is definitely a let-down).  By the film's end, it sounds like a depression-awareness piece, a tactic that is clearly below the talent levels of everyone involved.  THE BEAVER is an oddity--in a good way--but not odd enough; it tries to settle for feel-good drama, and it shouldn't.  There's something very, very uncomfortable about a man who walks around with a beaver puppet on his hand.  At its best moments, THE BEAVER addresses this awkwardness and runs with it; at its worst (and there are too many of these), it ignores the absurdity and plays straight, making this a mixed-bag of a film, but one worth at least a viewing or two.",1314144000,3,2301,4.976439790575916

""The Beaver""

For anyone who struggles with depression `The Beaver' is a must see.  Mel Gibson's Walter is depression personified.  In fact, Walter is so desperately depressed that it almost seems this puppet takes Walter on as if the puppet, itself,  was alive.  Why should this be curious?  Well, the puppet talks, but Walter moves his lips - no ventriloquist tricks here.  The `Beaver' looks like a mangy, dirty puppet he found on the street, because that's where he found him. Still, I got caught up in the dialogue and the story.  Walter convinced me he was sad, and, interestingly enough, so did Gibson.  With so many marriages  on the fritz today, so many children caught up in the divorce wars, it was refreshing to watch this family love and hate each other toward some kind of heart human ending.

Jodi Foster directed and acted as Walter's `I can't take it anymore' wife.  What a beautiful woman.  She certainly got the best out of Gibson in the film.  Anton Yelchin was excellent as Walter's son who made a very long, very depressing list of what he had in common with his dad.  Afterwards, he worked on ventilating his room.  I enjoyed watching Jennifer Lawrence (of Winter's Bone) play such a different role.

While there were laugh-out-loud moments, this movie becomes very serious.  And, I must reiterate, for those of us who have suffered depression of significant duration, there may be an enduring poignance at the apex.  For what wouldn't one do to rid oneself of the very thing ...

In order to mourn and let himself be revived out of depression, he needs to seperate from a major force belittling his true self:  an internalized voice which takes on a life of its own - The Beaver.  The positive side of this is that the voice can be more clearly identified and acknowledged rather than it being too blurred/merged within.  By the way, Marshall Rosenberg, the creator of the Non Violent Communication (NVC) four-step model, uses the puppet of a jackal to represent the inner critic who then gets mirrored by a giraffe in his other hand.

4552813,3,B0053XZ8YC,"Walter Black (Mel Gibson) is the CEO of a once-successful toy company who has become so hopelessly depressed that all he does is sleep. In addition to his company going under, his marriage to Meredith (Jodie Foster) is falling apart and she quietly kicks him out. Hitting rock bottom, Walter happens upon a beaten-up beaver hand-puppet that begins ""talking"" when he slips it on his hand. The next day Walter hands his family a card explaining that the beaver is ""designed to create a psychological distance between himself and the negative aspects of his personality"" and that the beaver should be addressed rather than Walter himself. When the beaver starts speaking, in a British accent that sounds like Ray Winstone in a too-similar-to-be-coincidental way, there's no cinematic trickery involved to create a superficial illusion. Walter is clearly working the puppet's mouth and his own mouth clearly moves to speak for the beaver. While their teenage son Porter (Anton Yelchin) is unable to accept his father's ""toy,"" their youngest son Henry loves the puppet, prompting Meredith to accept Walter and the beaver. With the beaver's ""help,"" Walter attempts to revitalize both his company and his marriage. In a parallel plot thread,  romance blossoms between Porter and Norah (Jennifer Lawrence), the school valedictorian, after she asks him to write her graduation speech.

Somewhere within The Beaver lurks a good, perhaps great film that has all the ingredients necessary to be one, but somewhere down the line loses its way. It's not that the script by Kyle Killen and its wacky premise asks too much of the audience, as it's handled remarkably well for how off-the-wall it is, but the script is the weakest point in what is mostly a strong film. The film is billed as a ""comedy-drama,"" which is fine if you settle on a tone and roll with it. The material could be very dark, but is handled in a straight-forward manner that is not particularly comedic and never dramatic enough. Sticking to one genre would've proven much more effective. The Beaver  just never quite finds its footing, and when it does push the dark undercurrent to the forefront it quickly withdraws from it. Furthermore, it's a complicated story that isn't done justice with its 85-minute running time. There seems to be something special here, but this just feels like the condensed version. The performances are great though!

The Beaver marks Jodie Foster's return to directing after a 16-year absence and is the first major, post-controversy role for Mel Gibson. The film would fall apart if not for the performances and Foster's steady, confident direction. As Meredith, Foster fashions a character who supports her husband under such strange circumstances without incident. Her performance never suggests that her acceptance of Walter is out of the ordinary and in that respect, it's an endearing performance full of strength and warmth. Yelchin and Lawrence have a cute rapport with each other and both young actors give convincingly mature performances. Lawrence especially has been on a role in the last year and continues to show that she more range than just about any other actress her age. She has quite the career ahead of her.

Walter is a complicated character, as not much is known about him. There's little insight into how he was before, what (if anything) triggered the depression, and he spends much of the film hiding behind the voice of the Beaver. This is a daunting task for an actor, spending the majority of a film talking through a hand-puppet and yet Gibson pulls it off marvelously without ever being campy. His sympathetic performance may actually sway those who have found him less than sympathetic in recent years. I'd say that Gibson's role through almost the entire movie is Walter as the Beaver and he makes this plight convincing, even with a script that gives him little to work with. Gibson relies heavily on his face and eyes to play Walter, establishing the character with just a few expressions. But when the beaver is speaking for Walter, a closer look at Gibson's eyes suggest the demons within. It's an Oscar-caliber performance, full of the depth that the film itself is lacking.

Killen's script jumps immediately into the plot, dedicating little time to fleshing out the characters before leaving them at the mercy of the story. They are developed well enough under the circumstances, mostly due to the strength of the actors, but Killen doesn't give them much room to breathe. He pushes the novelty overboard in the third act, with a brief shift in tone that could have brought The Beaver to a much more poignant, emotional climax. A re-write dedicating more time to the characters would have been beneficial. Burrowing deeper into their psyches, expanding them to give the audience more of a reason to care and this would've been really interesting.

There are emotional moments; moments of passion, moments of power, but you're hit with it all so quickly that it doesn't quite gel. With so much good, it's unfortunate The Beaver doesn't live up to its full potential. Foster's direction and the exceptional cast improve tremendously on the material and it's well made, with straight-forward direction that eschews anything flashy. Unfortunately, the bottom line is that The Beaver is an admirable film that simply begins too quickly and ends too soon.

4552814,5,B0053XZ8YC,"Writer Kyle Killen and Director/actress Jodie Foster are two brave souls - to create a film about the serious psychological illness of Depression is a tough assignment alone, but to select as the star of this film the beleaguered sociopathic actor Mel Gibson whose appeal to audiences is at an all time low was an even testier decision.  The result of all of these preparatory decisions is that the film works - very well.  This may be the finest performance by Gibson on film and in many ways that is due to the faith and friendship of his defender and friend Jodie Foster.  Drop preconceived biases and see this rather extraordinary film: it will not leave your conscience

Walter Black (Mel Gibson) is a severely depressed new CEO-by-inheritance of a toy company, partnered by the wise and understanding Vice President (Cherry Jones).  He is unable to work at eh level expected and prefers to just stay in bed all day, escaping reality.  His wife Meredith (Jodie Foster) has tolerated his condition for too long and decides to leave him, taking their sons,  adolescent bright but insecure Porter (Anton Yelchin) and young Henry (Riley Thomas Stewart) with her.  Walter drinks far too much and in his bleak despair unsuccessfully attempts suicide by hanging, stopped only by the communication of a Beaver hand puppet Walter found in the dumpster who remains on Walter's hand and speaks to Walter through Walter's voice (which sounds strangely similar to Michael Caine!).  With the at times comedic lines  and advice from Beaver, Walter gains the strength to re-enter the world: the Beaver is his alter ego and provides a line of demarcation between the real world and the one Walter simply cannot manage alone.  The Beaver allows him to become a valuable force in his business while allowing him to re-connect with Meredith - a closeness they have not had in years - but always through the voice of the Beaver.  The one person who cannot cope with the faade is  Porter - a lad who is making it through life by writing papers for fellow students and ultimately is asked to write the graduation speech for the beautiful but bruised Norah (Jennifer Lawrence) - opening another subplot about coming of age and dealing with emotional baggage on the part of both Porter and Norah.  How Walter finally deals with the Beaver who seems to be preventing him from living an honest existence ties all the fragile threads of this story together.

Jodie Foster knows just how far to let each of her actors take their roles and in the end she has woven a tapestry about the tragedy of the diagnosis of depression  and its effect on a family that will be difficult to match.  Each of the actors gives razor sharp performances, but it is the baggage-laden Gibson who creates a character stronger than anything he has ever done before.  Life lessons learned? It doesn't matter. Take the film for what it is  - a brilliant exploration of familial love - and the rest is yesterday's lunch.  Grady Harp, August 11",1312588800,9,2994,4.754352030947776

4552816,5,B0053XZ8YC,"I was privileged to have the opportunity to see a screening of this film at SXSW this year, and the movie exceeded my expectations. As both an advocate for mental health and someone who loves a realistic story about family dynamics, I can honestly say that this movie paints a real picture of the messy side of life; there's conflict, laughter, tears, and sometimes, there are just feelings that you can't put into words. It's an excellent story of a man and his family, career, and inner turmoil. By the end of the movie, the story had a grip on me, and I was in tears at the end listening to Jennifer Lawrence's graduation speech. Jodie Foster, Mel Gibson, Anton Yelchin and Jennifer Lawrence are a superb cast, and they truly make the story that much more impactful. Regardless of your feelings about the cast, I would ask that you just sit and watch the movie. If you regret it, at least you'll have something to talk about at the office or dinner table.",1311897600,6,958,4.511494252873563
4552817,5,B0053XZ8YC,"Okay, silly title aside, this is one of the best films of the year but because Mel Gibson's personal problems are too fresh in the minds of the movie going audience....it's a flop.

Then we come to the truth about Hollywood -- it's run by Jews -- and since one of Mel's outbursts sort of slammed the Jews as global war mongers -- I doubt Mel (or Jodi) will see any Oscar recognition for this masterpiece.  Compound that with the fact that half of Academy voters are women and Mel's in the hot seat for supposedly being abusive to his girlfriend...and ""doubt"" becomes a certainty.  A shame, really, when we consider that convicted rapists like Mike Tyson get heralded as stars in films like The Hangover (1 & 2)...but I digress...

The film's story drags a little when it deals with the teenage son, but that is probably the only flaw with the film and it's definitely one that a viewer can live with.

The film is very unsettling.  The absurdity of the situation with the puppet makes the viewer question if they should be laughing or crying.  This is powerful stuff.  And Gibson keeps it all tied together.

Then there is the honesty in Gibson's performance, possibly the most unsettling aspect of the film -- is he acting?  Is anyone THAT good an actor?  Watch and decide.",1309478400,6,1274,4.543859649122807

8455840,4,B0053XZ8YC,"...it's results can be quite extreme at times. While ""The Beaver"" can appear lighthearted and humorous at times, you really need to keep in mind that this film is about depression within a family that dysfunctional and in a very awkward transition of being broken-up, reuniting, etc. Gibson's character has endured his depression to the point that when he experiences his ""make or break"" moment, he mentally splits-off into multiple personalities. Although I can't say I completely understand this occurrence, I have seen it happen to others and there's no way to predict it.

Personally, I found the film fascinating and the awkward moments (such as when there is a public miscommunication or when things go horribly wrong with the best intentions) made it that much more realistic. And make no mistake, this will be an uncomfortable film for you to watch. I understand this will not attract many viewers, but nonetheless I find this to be one of the film's better aspects since mental health is rarely touched-on so effectively in the movie industry.",1497830400,,1052,5.011428571428572
8455841,5,B0053XZ8YC,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to the protagonist so much.  Great movie about depression and the desperate lengths some people go to to attempt to cope with this world (been there).  And how difficult it can be when family just doesn't seem to understand.  Makes it that much harder to ""turn things around"" like they want you to.  A little empathy goes a long way.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,3,1426,4.611111111111111
8455842,5,B0053XZ8YC,"Unlike fellow reviews I didn't see just a ""puppet"" and a depressed man. I saw the human condition in in lowest moment reaching for a coping mechanism. And like many of those coping mechanisms we reach for and invite into our lives, for a time they make our lives better than ever. Then ultimately bring us and our loved ones further down into despair. When we attempt to free ourselves from our chosen coping mechanism we find that it has a firm grip and that IT doesn't want to let us go. Ultimately the only way out is through Jesus words in Matthew 18.
