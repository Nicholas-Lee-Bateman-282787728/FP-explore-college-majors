After creating the documentary President Carter,Killer Rabbits and UFO's,I wanted to branch out into the suspence thriller genre featuring a conspiracy theory. While some of the footage is lacking in terms of visual quality, it makes up for it in its wit and charm. Originally, this film was divided into 4 parts.they have been combined for this dvd release. It is a fictional suspence thriller and yet at the same time resembles actual events in politics surrounding 9/11, president Bush and enemy combatants at the time. So, it must be watched more than one time to catch on. Also, resembling true news events is the tained feed from china. At the time ,China had imported many tainted items and foods into the USA.This film is more witty than funny. However the bronx cheers make up for any lack of humour in part two and three. Beware:The characters (especially steve and his wife) grow on you after a few viewings and you will find yourself quoting lines from the film.highly recommended",1251849600,,1084,4.7712765957446805
