8441353,5,B004UA8DN2,"""Ero and Leandro"" is a tragic opera, composed by Giovanni Bottesini, premiered in Italy in1879 and staged an amazing 29 times before vanishing from the repertoire. It features three excellent singers: Veronique Mercier as Ero, tenor Gian Luca Pasolini as Leandro, and basso Roberto Scandiuzzi as the cruel tyrant Ariofarne. The Coro Claudio Monteverdi and the Orchestra Filarmonica del Piemonte provide a superb musical context for these three singers, whose arias are the sort of grand be canto that Verdi fans adore. In fact, Bottesini and Verdi were well acquainted; Bottesini conducted the premiere of Verdi's Aida, and the libretto for Ero & Leandro was written by another opera composer, Arrigo Boito. Bottesini was best known as a virtuoso double-bass player, and CDs of his works for his own instrument is available.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giovanni-Bottesini-Double-Bass-Concerto/dp/B00004U934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giovanni Bottesini: Double Bass Concerto</a>&nbsp;The ever-glorious Enrico Caruso included one of Leandro's arias in his recital repertoire long after the full opera had fallen into neglect. Gian Luca Pasolini has exactly what one might imagine as a Caruso-like tenor voice, thrilling enough to compensate for his weakness as an actor; he's twice the age and three times the girth of any plausible Leander, the young lover who swam the Hellespont nightly to woo the priestess Hero,imprisoned on an island (according to Boito's libretto by the vengeful rejected suitor Ariofarne. Basso Scandiuzzi is resoundingly fine as the villain in this tragedy; his voice and his arrogant stage presence would make him a superb ""Scarpia"" in Puccini's tragic Tosca. Veronique Mercier is simply lovely, visually and vocally, as the virgin priestess Ero. To my ears at least, Bottesini's compositional skills were very close to Verdi's and a lot finer than Boito's. The grand choral sections of this opera, at the beginning of each act, are outstanding music per se. The vocal writing isn't especially distinctive but it's thoroughly poised and affective. Ero and Leandro have a couple of poignant duets. Really, it's a remarkably fine opera for something so utterly forgotten.

This revival of ""Ero and Leandro"" seems to have been a kind of community project, funded by the ""Associazione Musicale Giovanni Bottesini"" of the province of Cremona in northern Italy. Bottesini (1821-1889) was born in Crema, and this production was filmed in the Teatro San Domenico of his home city in 2009. I haven't seen that theater, but clearly it must be fairly small by opera-house norms. The stage is quite small; costumes and sets are not the prime inducement for watching this DVD, but the film quality is decent and the sound recording is excellent. It's definitely a balmy evening's entertainment.",1327017600,3,2854,5.560919540229885
