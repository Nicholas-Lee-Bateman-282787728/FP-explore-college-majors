4598541,5,B0058IFSVK,"I will never forget the Wonderful World of Disney movies and this one was my absolute favorite. I have been looking for it off and on for years and now here it is.

Two nerds pose as foreign exchange students and become popular but they can't keep up the charade forever. I highly recommend this!",1340150400,5,296,4.381818181818182
4598542,5,B0058IFSVK,"Holy Cow!  After waiting for decades, this movie is finally available in a clean digital format!  If you search the internet for reviews, you'll see that the film's legion of fans have been holding onto their off-the-air taped VHS copies, often fragmented and way worn-out, since it was aired in 1987, and for good reason.  This film is one of the best 80's time-capsule experiences there is, and with several big stars and some pretty creative plot devices.  If you are a fan of John Hughes films of this era, you'll feel right at home with Student Exchange.  It's such a fun idea, I'm surprised no one has yet developed a full-blown theatrical production based on it.  If you're considering a blind buy on this and have never seen it, you can rest assured that you'll be well-compensated for your faith in this film, and will enjoy it with your family for generations to come.",1334102400,11,878,4.632258064516129
4598543,5,B0058IFSVK,"Omg..I've been looking for YEARS for a copy of this. When I found it was a made-for-TV movie, I became disappointed at the small chance of it going to DVD, but here it is !!

It's a super fun movie that I enjoyed watching as a kid. It is an all around, feel-good film that has a happy ending.",1316044800,10,292,3.9491525423728815

4598545,5,B0058IFSVK,Although It's an old film it was enjoyable throughout. It just shows that obscenity and swearing are not requirements for a film to be appreciated.,1383523200,,147,4.92
4598546,5,B0058IFSVK,"I was so excited to find this movie. I have been looking for a copy of it for years. We had a copy on Beta growing up, but obviously this is so much better.

4598552,5,B0058IFSVK,"Dear Madame / Sir,

I apologize, because I received the order last week but I could not write before.
The DVD arrived well, but my DVD player, can not see the movie, so I've tried with other players, but without success.
Thank you very much.

Kindest regards,

4598553,5,B0058IFSVK,"I first hired this out of the video shop 20 years ago (way back when DVDs hadn't yet been invented) and I remember watching it 3 times in one week because I loved it that much.  It wasn't until last year something jogged my memory, and I suddenly remembered this movie again.  I didn't have high hopes for it being on DVD so was very excited when I came across it.  At first I was worried it wouldn't be as good as I remembered, and I had hyped it up in my mind too much.  Luckily it was even better than I remembered.  I may be an adult now, but it did not stop me from enjoying this movie about two teenagers Carole and Neil who have been ignored through out their high school years.  In their senior year, they realize it's their last chance to get noticed.  When Carole comes across a letter stating two foreign exchange students will not be attending their school, she decides to hide the letter and convince her friend Neil they should pretend to be the foreign exchange students.  After some weeks preparing their makeovers and perfecting their accents, they turn up at school with Carole being a beautiful French girl, and Neil pretending to be a charasmatic Italian boy.  They are an instant hit, and are soon part of the popular crowd.  Unfortunately they also manage to ruffle a few feathers, and are soon realizing popularity is not what they thought it would be.  It's a lovely, funny movie from beginning to end, and I'm sure I will be watching it several times a year now I have my own copy.",1361059200,5,1506,4.381294964028777

8461576,5,B0058IFSVK,"I grew up on this movie and loved it. We only had it on VHS taped from the tv, and we always looked for it on DVD. So I was completely thrilled to look it up and find that Disney had made a DVD of it! It has a great picture and sound. Glad I could add it to my collection!",1501113600,,272,3.4754098360655736

8461580,5,B0058IFSVK,"I didn't catch this movie on the Disney channel back in the 1980s because I was in college at the time. It's a cute movie and fun to watch. The two geeks are very clever in disguising themselves as foreign exchange students. Of course, their ruse is discovered, but the film is heartwarming and has a nice ending. Great for familes.",1437523200,,332,4.459016393442623
8461581,5,B0058IFSVK,I'd literally been watching online for years for this movie to be offered on DVD.  Just a great 80s feel-good flick from Disney.,1435968000,,128,4.565217391304348

8461583,5,B0058IFSVK,I had seen it on tv many years ago and waited forever to find it on DVD.  It is a cute movie about smart kids who just want to be noticed,1431561600,,137,3.4193548387096775
8461584,5,B0058IFSVK,"I watched this 20 years ago, and was excited when I saw it was out to buy.  The price was a little more than I'm usually willing to spend, but since I'm planning to watch this many times it was probably money well spent.  The movie was just as wonderful as I remembered so I'm glad I didn't just hype it up in my memory.  If you love Disney movies, then you will love this Disney vintage movie.",1408924800,2,394,4.0256410256410255
