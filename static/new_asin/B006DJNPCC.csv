Excellent quality and digital restoration of my favorite Soviet cartoon masterpiece.",1488672000,,133,5.380952380952381
8496736,4,B006DJNPCC,"The subtitles were actually surprising in the accuracy. I'm learning Russian as a hobby, so the winnie pooh is great because of how it is identifiable. Russia puts a cool spin on the american versions. Karlson is a funny goof ball character that i'm learning to admire, and it helps expand knowledge through simple plots as well.",1483660800,,329,4.7894736842105265

8496742,4,B006DJNPCC,"Several cartoons from Soviet Russia.  The Russian version of the Winnie the Pooh (Vinnie Poox - the X is that coughing noise).  These were made by the Soviets in the 60's. The Disney's version is closer to the book, but the Russian one has his own charm too. When available this DVD has the three episodes made in the 60's for soviet kids.  They are also on You tube most of the time (with more accurate subtitles). Search for Russian Winnie or Russian Vinnie if you are interested. Owl, Rabbit, Piglet and Eeyore are also here.  No sign of Tigger though.  A little weird to see Piglet with a gun (and funny).  The other titles on here were not as interesting to me, but seem to be very popular in Russia.  Karlson is a meddling character (from a swedish tale) who flies around via a propeller on his back.  All of these have English sub titles and the one I got was an NTSC (USA) DVD.  Sometimes the stuffed doll of Winnie is also available on Amazon.  Search for B00DVOTBNE.",1413331200,,976,4.372222222222222
