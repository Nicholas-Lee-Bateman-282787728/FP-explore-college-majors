8523032,4,B000FP2IRS,"I like this DVD quite a bit because it has Victoria Red mainly.  If you think she isn't hot then your tolerance is probably inhuman.  Charlie Lane is fine here, but I think she looks better when she has an off colored eye-shadow or something to make her not look so ordinary.  Crissy Moran is disappointing to me because her cheeks are so read it is like she just ran a marathon and it is distracting because she is normally a total fox.  As with all peaches comes with 4 scenes and a gallery.",1365638400,,493,4.212765957446808
8523033,3,B000FP2IRS,"This is a pretty good effort by Peach.  Most of the breasts appear to be real.  There is a general absence of tattoos and the kind of body piercings I dislike.  (See below.)  Full frontal and rear exposures generally are pretty good.  There are two girl/girl sequences that are lacking in this regard.  With Peach you generally know what you get and don't get.  Peach has done better than this one.

Personal preferences:  I prefer normal breasts to fake ones.  (I really don't mind breast implants that have a semblance of normality to them.  I really dislike the circular and flattish kind that I find grotesque.)  I don't care for a lot of tattoos.  In terms of body piercings, I rather like navel piercings, considering them decorative.  However, I consider tongue, nipple, clitoral and labial piercings to constitute self-mutilation and find them grotesque.  I consider the best Penthouse dvds to be the gold standard in soft core.  Peach comes in second followed by Playboy and Vivid.",1252713600,5,990,4.873493975903615
