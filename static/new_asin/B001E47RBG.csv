8296292,5,B001E47RBG,"We looked for this movie for years and years, even before DVDs were invented.  I was so happy the seller found it and offered it for sale.  It is so hard to get PAL movies in the United States, and we are really pleased with this movie.  It was fun to watch it again after all these years (since seeing it in a theater).",1383004800,,320,3.96875
