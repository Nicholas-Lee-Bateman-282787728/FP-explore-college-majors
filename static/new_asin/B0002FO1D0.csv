However the idea of 'endless carrots and other vit A rich juices' doesnt always work. I drank so much carrot juice my hands turned orange!
A friend says a doctor look at her hands and said 'if you keep drinking so much carrot juice you may get tumors'!

FROM WIKI:

Gary Null has written attacks on many facets of conventional medicine. He says that physicians are not conspiring but are just trained and conditioned to accept the premises of their profession. Concerning chronic illnesses their economic interest is in sickness maintenance, not prevention. Null co-authored a series of articles on cancer research, new therapies, and political influence for Penthouse beginning with one entitled ""The Great Cancer Fraud"".[14][15] He accused the ""medical community of suppressing alternative cancer treatments to protect the medical establishment's solid-gold cancer train"". Time said (1999), ""from a young reporter this is to be expected. But two decades later, Null, 54 is still warning of a variety of medical bogeymen out to gull a trusting public"".[16]

Gary Null is also noted for his views concerning HIV and AIDS. From a June 2000 article[17] he wrote:

""A growing number of critics, including leading virologists and Nobel Prize winning scientists, doctors, journalists, and other academicians, question HIV's relationship to the diseases we term AIDS. Some argue that HIV has never been isolated; therefore, we have no proof of its existence. Others believe that HIV does exist, but that it can't possibly be doing everything that it is purported to do as it is merely one of 3,000 retroviruses, none of which have ever been proven harmful. What these dissenters have in common is a belief in the need to re-evaluate the HIV = AIDS hypothesis.""

In a speech on May 15, 1979, titled, Fascism in Medicine[18] he set out to expose the power of medical associations, ""...this shows you where fascism really exists, any doctor in the United States who cures cancer using alternative methods will be destroyed"". He went on to accuse researchers of wasting research money. When you spend a ""trillion dollars on something, you're going to assume you're going to come up with some positive ideas. But there are no positive ideas in cancer"". With regard to health care he stated, ""There is no health-care in the United States or in England. Or anywhere else. It doesn't exist. We have sickness maintenance"". He believes physicians were not acting in the best interest of their patients because of their conditioning, training, and acceptance certain premises; that physicians have been trained in pharmacology, not in prevention.

Null co-authored a two-part report called Death by Medicine and a 35-part collection of studies of medical wrongdoing entitled, Iatrogenic Illness: The Downside of Modern Medicine. With the intention of eliminating what he saw as abusive practices by the pharmaceutical",1202169600,6,2967,5.145228215767635

To be quite honest, I did not watch the whole thing.  I'm sure I missed out on a lot of great information further into the documentary.  However, I found the beginning a bit drab and it really didn't get my attention.

lol...over all, it's worth watching.

Then go find someone who gives you the tools to get started.  I found Kris Carr's program - 21-day wellness program.
its' online, and has a huge following.  I signed up for it, and within days of joining, did what I had to do to prepare my life AND kitchen
to make it work for me.  THAT is what may be missing for so many who are trying to succeed at this healthy endeavor - Tools AND a Program to follow.  WE need STRUCTURE & Education - so we can UnDO all the lies and addictive foods that are out there.  BUT it is so worth it,
if you live longer and healthier.

No offense, even though this video was extremely interesting and educating, it was hard to stay focused because his voice puts me to sleep.  So, I'm not sure if he needs to speak a little faster or do something to get himself pumped before making a video so the tone in his voice is not so calming.  I was able to watch it without falling asleep because it was a very good topic, message, and I enjoyed it.  I wish he would have touched on steam baths but that's OK.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't believe in yoga, taichi (not sure how to spell it), or hypnosis because of the bible.  But other than that, is was a really great video.  I would watch it again and recommend it to others.  I am going to take his advice on the health tips that he gave.  I have been vegetarian for 2 years and I'm trying to go vegan.
