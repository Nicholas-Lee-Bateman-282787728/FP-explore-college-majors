SYNOPSES--

SATURDAY AFTERNOON--  Harry Langdon's ""Little Elf"" usually goes home from the steel plant to an overbearing wife. This Saturday afternoon however, his friend Steve Smith (Vernon Dent) convinces Harry to sneak away and join him for some fun with a couple of cuties.

SUPER-HOOPER-DYNE LIZZIES--  Scripted by radio-hobbyist Frank Capra and directed by Del Lord (of later 3 Stooges fame). Burbank Watts (Clyde) invents a device that can remotely control any radio-equipped cars. His assistant, Hiram Case (Bevan) runs out of gas and pushes his car, inadvertantly becoming the caboose to a line of seven parked autos. He labors up a hill and shoves the seven over a cliff. Later, Watts throws a party; nightwatchman Hiram falls asleep while guarding the lab. An oil merchant and cohort break in, looking to smash the inventor's transmitterbut the creepily-costumed partyers scare them off.

WANDERING WILLIES--  Also helmed by Sennett's favorite director, Del Lord. Bevan and Clyde are a vagrant and an escaped convict. Clyde tricks a cop into disrobing; Bevan steals and dons his uniform. With Clyde hiding in a baby carriage, the two enter a diner. The secreted Clyde steals plates of food and lit cigars. Bevan does the oyster stew routine later copied exactly by Lou Costello. The two cadgers are caught and compelled to work off their bill. The film climaxes with one of the craziest car chases ever.

A MUDDY ROMANCE--  The real-life drainage of Echo Lake prompted this ad-libbed slapstick classic. The Keystone Kops and three civilians get mired in the bed of the freshly drained lake.

A MOVIE STAR--  Film stardom was still a novelty when this spoof was committed to celluloid. Egotist Mack Swain mingles with the public at a nickelodeon-opening of his latest western, ""Big Hearted Jack,"" wherein Swain's obese cowboy hero rescues Nell from the Injuns and wins her from his rival. When the movie ends, Swain's adoring fans follow the flirtatious ham out of the theater, where he's met by an angry umbrella-wielding missus wth two kiddies in tow.

BARNEY OLDFIELD'S RACE FOR A LIFE--  Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand are sweethearts. Ford Sterling is the mustachioed villain intent on winning Mabel's love. When she spurns him, Ford gets his two thugs to chain Mabel to the RR tracks, then the three hijack an engine to finish her off. Mack enlists racecar driver Oldfield's aid and they speed away to save Mabel, in a tightly-edited, split-second sequence quite complex for 1913.

Very unfunny stuff, I'm sorry to say -I do like slapstick comedy, but this collection didn't do anything for me.  (I have also bought the DVD set called ""Slapstick Encyclopedia,"" - these volume 2 comedies are on the DVD set, too -  so I haven't given up.)",1138665600,,364,4.323529411764706
