7846199,4,6303418864,"My son loved this series when he was a kid.  I've given them as gifts to little guys for years and they never disappoint.  I do wish they'd offer them in DVD format but we make it work.  The humor is a bit goofy but they give really good information and like I said, the kids love them.  And, after all, it's really all about the kids.",1407542400,,335,3.955223880597015

7846201,4,6303418864,"Our 2 1/2 year old has watched this many times and loves it...but Dad has to find something else to do now when its on.  I wish that it didn't have the stupid ""inserts"" which try and give it a story or narrative quality.  Helicopters, that's what we want!  There are a good variety of Helicopters on the video, which makes it worth owning.  There are Coast-Guard, Marine & LA Police Department helicopters.  My son does seem to have learned a lot.  He has a toy helicopter and he uses the string and hook on it to rescue people, like on the video.  But the ""explanations"" on the video are simplistic in the extreme.  They probably tried to accomplish too many things on this one video.  My son would give it 4 stars at least, so that's what I give it.",1027641600,,751,4.2695035460992905
7846202,4,6303418864,"This is one of the better videos in the ""There Goes A..."" series.  If you can get past goofball Dave and his sidekick Becky, it  really is interesting and informative.",965260800,2,167,4.533333333333333
7846203,4,6303418864,"My son just loves Dave and Becky.. And this is a very good, action, keep  it moving video. I even enjoyed it too.. We watch this one a few times a  week..",958521600,4,154,3.78125
7846204,1,6303418864,"By the time the female co-anchor started complaining that she had to pee [while enroute to god knows where] and her male partner good-naturedly suggested she hold it in, we had seen enough to ask for a refund. Lotsa fun  for NONE of the family. My son would have LOVED a half hour of helicopters  taking off, flying & landing with NO comic relief, OR these two hosts.  Good intent - Poor results. Sorry.",943920000,18,403,4.418918918918919
