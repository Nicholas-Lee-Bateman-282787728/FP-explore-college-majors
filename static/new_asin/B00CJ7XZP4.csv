5724242,4,B00CJ7XZP4,"High Schooler Yuki has just moved to Enoshima to live with his grandmother. He has transferred schools a bunch of times, but Yuki doesn't make friends easily and he doesn't expect this time to be any different. But he didn't count on Haru. Haru is not only new to Enoshima, but also Earth, since Haru is an alien. Or so he says. Yuki thinks he is just nuts. But he finds himself drawn into an unlikely friendship with Haru and moody classmate Natsuki, as well as the mysterious Akira with his pet duck, Tapioca.

I have never had any interest in fishing (which is the hobby that brings the 4 friends together), but I thought it sounded like a fun show despite that. And it is fun. But it is also a lot about fishing. Which ended up more interesting than I had thought (still not taking it up myself though). You actually learn quite a bit about ocean fishing.
Aside from the fishing, there are aliens. And ducks. And of course, fish.

tsuritama is only 12 episodes long, which is the perfect length for the story it had to tell. The ending was nice and wrapped up the story perfectly. I enjoyed tsuritama quite thoroughly and will be buying the DVD set once it is released.",1368662400,4,1173,4.400921658986175
5724243,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"This dvd series main focus is on learning to fish on the ocean. Thought I like the way the creator showed the inability of the main character, Yuki and his inability to communicate while worrying about other people like being drowned in water. The aliens are like exotic colored siamese fighting fish that have the ability to change shapes and control people and animals briefly through water outside their bodies.",1359936000,,414,4.928571428571429
5724294,4,B00CJ7XZP4,"A little off beat and not typical but I enjoyed this anime.  I didn't care for the opening song (an usually I like anime music) but I wouldn't hold any fault.  the anime was enjoyable and the characters are quite likable ^_^ with the exception of the ""stink"" face that the main character does.....ewwwww :P",1412035200,,306,4.545454545454546
5724295,5,B00CJ7XZP4,Great Anime makes me happy! And although im a vegetarian makes me want to go fishing LOL!,1407283200,,89,4.294117647058823
5724296,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"This is a very whimsical, feel-good summer story. While aliens and an super-intelligent ducks are both themes of this animation, the story somehow maintains a down-to-earth, slice-of-life feeling. Characters and scenery are rendered in vivid super-saturated color, a feature you can only get the full effect of with the Blu-Ray version (which admittedly can be almost blinding if you have a bright TV, turn the brightness down for this one).

DVD is well-packaged and offers the standard language and sound options. Only regret I have is the abundance of advertisements before you get to the options menu... some of them were downright creepy. Overall, a wonderful purchase. Tsuritama is pleasant to watch and leaves the viewer feeling happy and hopeful. Generally speaking, it's also family friendly. I can't remember if the translation included any swearing. There's a lot of re-watch value, so I think this is definitely one to add to your collection. Take it out every summer and enjoy it again!",1401494400,,999,5.166666666666667
5724297,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"Best anime of all time. It's got everything -- ducks, aliens, fishing, ancient legends, friendship, secret societies that sort of revolve around rubber ducks . . .

Our story begins with Yuki, a high-schooler whose frequent transfers have cursed him with severe social anxiety, to the point that he is completely friendless . . . until Haru, a bubbly transfer student, shows up and announces that they are going fishing. Also, Haru is an alien. (This pretty much sets the tone for everything that happens afterwards.)

In between learning to fish, our heroes begin to realize that something is not right on this small Japanese island . . . in fact, there is a sinister presence nearby that could threaten the fate of the entire world. The answer, as it turns out, is fishing -- and if you think fishing is all about sitting about and drinking beer, wait until you see our heroes' truly epic final fishing trip.

In the end, 'Tsuritama' Is an intensely positive story, the key element of which is friendship and learning to trust and work together. In addition to Yuki and Haru, we also have Natsuki, the prickly local fishing expert, and Akira, an aloof and enigmatic transfer student from India (who carries a duck named tapioca with him at all times). Together, the four make up the most epic fishing team ever.

The supporting cast is equally awesome, from the eccentric shrine priest, to the lively fishing boat captain, to Haru's (also-an-alien) sister. There are moments that will have you a little misty-eyed, and moments where you'll be cracking up, and moments that will really make you think.

In essence: truly brilliant. Worth every penny, and way, way more.",1401148800,,1670,4.825174825174825
5724298,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"I really don't wanna overhype this series but after watching many 12 episode anime I just can't suppress my desire to praise Tsuritama as the best one cour series in the last... maybe five years. Tsuritama is hands down a masterpiece, it's the result of what happens when the writers understand well the story they want to tell, where they want it to go and how to end it. Yet the story is very, very simple. The genius of its writing lies in its characters and their development, for it's executed so competently that by the last episode you'll be devastated by the thought that you will never see these characters again for their tale has ended. It's charming, entertaining, colorful, lovable, funny, serious, heart-warming, and very, very satisfying. I guarantee you that it'll leave you with a big grin on your face for is entire run time.",1395792000,5,843,4.702702702702703
5724299,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"I watched Tsuritama a few years back and it became one of my favorite animes ever, so when I heard that an English version was being released (and on blu-ray AND with the Japanese voices!), I just had to get it.

If you're one of those ""'original' Japanese voices ONLY URRG"" purists, I don't think that I can help you, but if you often find to prefer Japanese voice acting most of the time, I think you'll have a nice time with the voices of the dub. I particularly like Yuki's English voice over his Japanese voice and Haru's and Sakura's Japanese voice over the English, but the voice acting is so smooth in both versions that I just want to double thumbs up the Japanese and English voice cast!

When I first put the disc into my PS3 and began watching, it was like I was watching it for the first time again, so I think the blu-ray is worth it for the quality.

As for the story, I'm not a fishing person at all, but the story is so fun and entertaining that watching anime characters fish was actually really entertaining. I think what made it fun was that it was about relationships between friends and having that as a main theme brings this series to life compared to other sporty anime that attempts to do something similar (looking at you, Kuroko). I'm not getting into the story much, but the main villian's plot makes you feel frustrated but it's kind of hard to be upset with him because his plot was just cute and it's a feel good story.

And Yuki and Haru are totally boyfriends.",1392163200,5,1494,4.344086021505376
5724300,5,B00CJ7XZP4,It's wacky but I love it. :D The animation is decent and the characters are loveable. The only thing is the voice acting takes some to get used to if you are used to the Japanese dub.,1391817600,,183,3.972972972972973
5724301,5,B00CJ7XZP4,This anime is fun and awesome and just makes you feel good. Its that simple.- I need to use more words.,1388361600,,103,3.9523809523809526
5724302,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"It looks great
It's in Japanese with English subtitles AND there is an English dub!
2 discs, complete series.

If you're thinking about it, don't bother. JUST BUY IT.",1383264000,,166,4.724137931034483
5724303,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"I love this anime.

It is sweet and entertaining. I've watched the series three times now since I have purchased it last month. I remember watching it when it was still subbed two years ago. The story is refreshing and you cannot help but fall in love with the characters.",1382227200,,272,4.44

works great and fast shipping

8582440,5,B00CJ7XZP4,Awesome Anime. Teaches some pretty cool stuff about fishing. Funny and worth the purchase.,1461628800,,90,5.5
8582441,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"Great slice of life anime.  Especially if you like to fish. There is zero fan service, which I personally appreciate since I have two daughters that watch anime with me.  I purposely search for anime that doesn't have that aspect.  Not wanting to give spoilers so I'll be pretty brief.  Tsuritama is about unlikely friendships.  The main character is a loner, who meets a group of friends who under normal circumstances would never hang out together, but through a mutual love or interest in fishing, they become the best bunch of friends.  There is an underlying crisis arc for suspense, but the main point is about friendship and opening up to others.

I recommend for anyone who just wants a relaxing series with not a lot of thinking involved.",1459987200,,747,4.744186046511628
8582442,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"I've loved Tsuritama since the fandom was booming in 2012, so I knew I had to get this once it was released. It's a very bittersweet anime with lots of cute moments and an ending that will leave you happy, but still riddled with feels. even now, as I watch it, I can't he lp but feel a tightening sensation in my chest. The quality is good and I'm happy to report that they've gone ahead and fixed the animation errors (although I feel you're not rly getting the full tsuri experience without them lol). I seriously recommend getting this DVD if you're into slice of life!",1457481600,,572,4.355140186915888
8582443,4,B00CJ7XZP4,"English dub isn't great (decent, no lie) my main issue is that the subtitles are for the english dub and not the original translation like on Hulu or crunchyroll. I'm not great at japanese but certain lines/words/expressions were changed for the audience and it lost the meaning like it had in the japanese dub.
BUT THE SHOW IS GREAT 10/10 WOULD FISH AGAIN",1454544000,,356,4.666666666666667
8582444,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"This anime is a joy to watch. It is extremely enjoyable and has vibrant colors and beautiful scenery. The characters are lovable, funny, and easy to become attached to and to relate with. The story was fun and emotional, having the perfect amount of humor mixed in along with the drama.
It was a unique and entertaining experience to watch, and it is something that I will be watching again.
The product was in beautiful condition, and all of the discs played perfectly. It arrived right on time, and was well protected with bubble wrap in a package that was small and perfect for its size.",1439424000,,590,4.5754716981132075
8582445,5,B00CJ7XZP4,"I agree with Vespiriano. As soon as I watched this anime, I said I had to buy it. I certainly did have the biggest grin on my face after every episode! I enjoyed the opening and ending songs, perhaps not for their quality but for the chord they struck in my heart. The characters are wonderfully developed. It's quite amazing!",1439078400,,326,4.45

8582447,5,B00CJ7XZP4,Super cute little anime that I highly recommend. Plot is a little weird and the ending left something to be desired but other than that it was a wonderful watch,1419897600,,160,4.366666666666666
