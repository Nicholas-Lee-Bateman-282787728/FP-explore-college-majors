2922093,4,B000UJCAMC,"The set is worth it for ""Jeopardy"" alone. I'm very surprised they haven't done a remake of this one. Barbara Stanwyck, Ralph Meeker, Barry Sullivan, and Lee Aaker all give fine performances in this tense thriller. When a family goes on  fishing vacation at a jetty, the father, played by Barry Sullivan becomes trapped under a pylon trying to save his son, played by Lee Aaker. When the mother, played by Stanwyck, goes for help. She is kidnapped by an escaped criminal, played by Ralph Meeker ( I was swearing this was Bill Paxton's dad). I was really glad I rented this one and plan to buy it now. I would love to see a modern day version of this. The Clark Gable racing movie is okay as a bonus but it is not one I would have bought alone. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Narrow Margin (1952)"".

And yes, every woman, femme fatale or not, and maybe a few guys too, loved, or should have loved romantic, dreamy and whatever Clark Gable any number of films, including famously Gone With The Wind and not a few screwball comedies as well. But nobody should love this combo in this film under review, To Please A Lady, a film that only goes to prove once again that not every actor made the right script choices in their careers since this one is leaden to say the least. Apparently film actors will take on films because they need the dough, need to see themselves on screen, need to fill up some time or need to, oh well, fill in the blanks. And one of those reasons must have impelled these two established stars on this one.

Here's the plot- line quickly. Clark is nothing but a king hell race- car driver. No not the big Indy racers, not at first anyway, although he dreams dreams of such success (having previously, pre-war, pre-World War II if you are asking, failed to make the grade at Indy) but midget racers, racers in the racing realm that are just above those box-car racers from our childhoods. But more, much more, dangerous. At least dangerous when fame-hungry Clark gets on the track and willingly creates all kinds of mayhem to win, win prize money to front for an Indy-type racer and glory. But fellow racers (and fans for a while) do not like wreck-less and crazy drivers who get other drivers killed by their maneuvers and that is where Barbara, Barbara as a powerful nationally syndicated columnist with enough weight to make or break a man (or woman) comes into the picture when she, looking for a story, goes out to the race-track one day.

And so that is how they met and how after Barbara sees Clark maneuver a fellow driver to his death aimed to destroy his career (and his dreams. Then it is curtains for Clark and his dreams. Well almost but roguish, manly Clark gets under Barbara's skin, you know what I mean, right. Thereafter, even though theirs is not a match made in heaven, the two are a pair, a pair right up to the big-time race at Indy. Of course the problem for us with this romantic comedy is that the cooing is too gluey for our times (and probably for theirs as well) and the plot line cannot sustain the drizzle. See what I mean. Watch these two in their better stuff not this one.

Once upon A Time In Mexico- Barbara Stanwyck's Jeopardy

Okay, take your normal average all-American 1950s family of three (mother, father, and junior), a nice convertible, maybe a Ford with a big engine, and let them take a little trip down Mexico way, actually Baja California but close enough. Nothing is going to happen to them except maybe some excess sun rays, bad water and bug bites, right?  No way is your normal average all-American family of three (mother, father, and junior), with a nice convertible, maybe a Ford with a big engine, going to have to test the outer limits of marital fidelity. No way, right? Except that is exactly the crisis the wife (and mother), played by Barbara Stanwyck confronts, and by implication every serious wife, in this taut little B-film black and white drama, Jeopardy. And it wasn't pretty confronting that limit. Not one bit.

So here is the scoop that got to that home truth moment. Our little family set off with great expectations for a nice little camping and fishing trip so that junior could learn about the great outdoors and the clan could get away from stuffy civilization for a couple of weeks. And things went fine until they got to an old pier and junior, as most juniors will, decided to explore its ramparts. His foot got caught in one of the rotting boards and Dad, Barry Sullivan, had to go rescue him. That part was fine except on return a plank gave loose and Dad had his foot stuck under a falling timber. Several futile attempts were attempted to free him but it is not use so Mom has to go back to a ranch gas station that had passed to get some rope and maybe some help. Oh yah, that place where dad landed, well, the tide was coming in, coming in fast so Mom had better be quick.

And she was, almost. Almost except she ran into a freaky American convict on the run at the ranchero who has other ideas. He wanted to get away, and use Mom as a hostage, stooge. What he doesn't give a damn about was Dad and his rising tide water problem. Well, he didn't until desperate Mom, ah, offered herself up to him in exchange for saving hubby. A tough, tough choice but she loved her man that much (although don't tell him that he might not see it exactly the same, the 1950s same way, high water riding or not). After the fiery con saved Dad the Federales came and our con is off.  And Mom had time, plenty of time to think, about what she did for her man. Yah, that is what happened one time, one sunny, explosive time in Mexico.",1374969600,,5157,4.477659574468085

""To Please A Lady/Jeopardy""
(Warner Video / Turner Entertainment, 2012)
----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: mild spoilers below. Deal with it.
----------------------------------------------------------------

This delightful single-disc DVD revives two little-known (and admittedly forgettable) Barbara Stanwyck oldies, ""To Please A Lady,"" from 1950 and 1953's ""Jeopardy,"" both of which feature wild and bewildering examples of American 1950s postwar patriarchal culture... Plus lots of Stanwyck, which is always a plus.

""To Please A Lady"" is the lesser of the two movies, with a clunky plot, poor direction, but lots of great clothes and interesting historical racing scenes. It was obviously pitched as a ""date movie"" with something for both guys and gals to enjoy: Clark Gable is a fiery race car driver who aims to win the Indy 500, and there's a lot of him tuning up his various hotrods (lots of time spent in the garage, with shots of the machines shown in surprisingly extensive detail). On the flipside, Stanwyck's cynical ""lady"" reporter character models some great dresses (including many with necklines that would make the folks on Project Runway swoon) and several scenes where they explicitly linger on her shoes for way longer than you could imagine: these scenes thrilled my retro-leaning wife, who says the shoes are amazing -- I'll take her word for it. There's also a lot of Gable's macho manly-man character teaching Stanwyck a thing or two about love, including a scene where he slaps her... and she likes it!... which might seem just a teeny bit sexist in retrospect. I imagine this film would be of particular interest to diehard NASCAR fans, as it's packed with archival footage of old races (possibly the actual Indy 500?) along with similar footage staged for the film, to show Gable's #17 in its various races.

1953's ""Jeopardy"" has a far grittier plot, and is almost a classic, except for some slow direction and weak character motivation. A cheerful all-American family's Mexican vacation goes sour when a seaside accident pins the father's leg under a heavy pylon, as the tide comes in, threatening to drown him. There's a howlingly hilarious series of scenes in which his stoic, masculine persona is established: he tells their son not to be all ""hysterical"" about things, like his mother, and when his leg gets pinned he's so ""calm"" that he's basically completely passive as the water comes in. Great stuff as Stanwyck struggles to save him, setting up a car jack to move the pylon and behaving in a completely capable, competent manner while the father -- trying to set a brave example for his son -- keeps yammering at her not to panic and then sends her off into the desert to look for help, and just sits there as the waves come crashing in. Hilarious. Of course, the whole point is to place Stanwyck's character into peril, which she finds in the form of a sexy, completely amoral fugitive on the run from the Mexican federales. This character, played by Ralph Meeker, is utterly fascinating, or rather, Meeker's performance is fascinating. He is almost shockingly modern, seeming like a Matt Damon or Mark Ruffalo in his attitude and demeanor; it's like a time traveler inserted himself in an ancient drama, so different doe he seem from the rest of the cast. Indeed, you almost wish she wold ditch her drab, drippy, patronizing dope of a hubby for this sexy psychopath... If only it weren't for that darn kid! A great film, in a kitschy kind of way, primarily for its window into Eisenhower-era sexism, but also for a lively and erotically charged performance by the ever-fab Barbara Stanwyck. Also notable as an early work by director John Sturges, who went on to do classics such as ""Bad Day At Black Rock,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""Gunfight At The OK Corral,"" and ""The Magnificent Seven,"" among others.

2922139,5,B000UJCAMC,"Ralph Meeker and Barbara Stanwyck are dynamite in ""Jeopardy"", their animal magnetism oozes right off the screen. Stanwyck is perfect as the woman struggling against panic to save her husband's life as she overcomes one obstacle after another. Ralph Meeker is ruthless and sleezy, but still sympathetic in the role of the escaped convict on the run; a movie like this makes a person wish that Ralph Meeker had had a long and successful career, instead of an early decline into bit parts and trashy, low-budgets. ""Jeopary"" has a great ending; finality with a tad of uncertainty.
""To Please a Lady"" starring a very tiresome, old Clark Gable cannot be saved even by the heroic efforts of co-star, Barbara Stanwyck.",1292025600,,710,4.925
2922140,5,B000UJCAMC,"I just bought this recently and mostly because of ""Jeopardy"", which stands as a very intelligent and different kind of suspenseful thrill of a movie. The whole cast of Stanwyck, Meeker, Sullivan and even the child actor, Lee Aaker do fantastic jobs in it. The Director is John Sturges, who also directed ""The Magnificent Seven"",""The Great Escape"", and ""Gunfight at The O.K. Corral""! It is well-worth buying as the print of ""Jeopardy"" is top-notch and nearly pristine!",1265500800,5,467,5.077922077922078
2922141,4,B000UJCAMC,"""To Please A Lady"" (1950, dir.: Clarence Brown) is nothing but routine, with a good Barbara Stanwyck as an investigative journalist meeting a racing driver (Clark Gable) and, of course, coming close to him after some dramatic events. The story is much too conventional, stereotype and predictable. Gable was a little bit too old for the part and acts with a total lack of irony or humor (even in his fifties, he would do better in later pictures and still be convincing as a leading man and romantic lover - see for example the Raoul Walsh pictures ""The Tall Men"" and ""The King and Four Queens""). Nevertheless, the film is not boring at all and contains some very good racing scenes full of vivid action and suspense. Three stars.

""Jepoardy"" (1953, dir.: John Sturges): A small thriller of only 69 minutes length and with no more than four performers (and some extras): A family (father, mother and a boy aged about ten) makes a weekend trip in Mexico, and when the father (Barry Sullivan) is trapped under a bridge pier while the flood rises, his wife (Stanwyck) has to fetch a rope. Unable to get one, she finally meets a murderer on the loose (Ralph Meeker) who is the only person able to save her husband's life... This is a perfect study of US citizens going ""abroad"" and getting helpless, not only in a geographical, but also in a metaphorical way. It is clear that we have a typical suburban couple not used to explore the unexpected. Stanwyck and Sullivan are obviously a bit frightened by anything unknown and beyond their world of work, homework, gardening, inviting the neighbors etc. Mexico is only I few hours away, but to them, it's a totally new and dangerous world. Sullivan packs a gun (""you never know""), but is totally nervous when only being asked routine questions by two policemen. Stanwyck would not have met Meeker if only she had remembered the Spanish word for ""rope"" (""cuerdo"") in a conversation with some Mexicans before. And the criminal is not Mexican, but a U.S. Citizen... Stanwyck once more gives a brilliant performance, and how helpless she may be at the beginning, in her scenes with Meeker, she is firmly decided to stand by her man - even if that means to leave him and to go with Meeker (which he demands in order to save Sullivan). You have to watch this strange mixture of toughness and tenderness, abomination and even seductiveness. This leads to a performance of a woman who finally is decided to keep her promise even if she will hate every minute of it. Stanwyck fulfils that difficult and almost paradoxical task with a maximum of credibility. The end of the picture is nevertheless surprising and not to be told. Five stars.",1261785600,5,2673,4.687234042553191
2922142,3,B000UJCAMC,"Barbara Stanwyck is probably my favorite actress, so I'm always interested in seeing anything that I haven't from this great legend.  Certainly she brings great presence, sex appeal, and attitude to nearly every project, but I have to say that both films in this double feature - especially TO PLEASE A LADY - probably rank in the lower half of her huge output, which I'm still only beginning to explore.

The only thing the films have in common really is that they mark the beginning of Stanwyck's transition from sexpot to mother/wife characters.  She was 43 in 1950 when TO PLEASE A LADY was released, and kept her figure well into old age of course, but there's an experienced air about her that's no longer in the slightest bit girlish.  Good thing too as she's paired with the near-50 Clark Gable, playing race car driver Mike Brannan, who Stanwyck as wealthy and powerful radio/newspaper columnist Regina Forbes decides to make into a human interest story at the beginning of the film.  Horrified by the way in which Brannan callously ignores a fatal crash that happens right in front of him - possibly even contributing to it - she goes out of her way to ruin him and get him out of racing, but inevitably (you knew this was coming didn't you?) falls for the roguish Gable charm.  Adolphe Menjou is along for the ride as her mean old uncle-like producer (?) Gregg.

Pretty much everything in the film is telegraphed a mile away, and it's neither funny enough to provoke a chuckle nor dramatic enough to care about.  Stanwyck and Gable are both ok but don't really seem in danger of sparking any flames; this film's rather antiquated notion of sexuality involves Brannan slapping Forbes and then roughly kissing her - and her liking it.  Not a good showcase for Stanwyck as the independent woman, despite her powerful career - she was just waiting for a rough guy like Gable to take her away all along, dontcha know.  Good racing footage I suppose, if that's meaningful then I suppose it would increase your interest.  Clarence Brown directs competently enough.  Ho hum.

Three years later, in the very short b-noir JEOPARDY from director John Sturges, Stanwyck has pretty well settled into the more ""mature"" (though still desirable and sexy) roles that she was to play for many more years.  She's Helen Stilwin, the mother of 10-year-old Bobby (Lee Aaker) and the wife of Doug (Barry Sullivan); the whole family is taking a trip down the then sparsely populated Baja peninsula, to places Doug visited during the war.  We get plenty of foreshadowing that they'll have problems alone in the stark countryside as we're told several times that there's almost no habitation for over 100 miles.  After a last stop at a deserted gas station where they hope to find water for the radiator, the Selwins stop at a remote pier for the night.  When Bobby gets caught and Doug has to rescue him, it's Doug who ends up pinned under a big piling as the tide is about to come in, and Helen who has to go back to the deserted station alone in search of rope to try to drag the log away and save him.

This is where we get into noir territory, as Helen runs into completely amoral murderer Lawson, played by the great Ralph Meeker.  Helen is desperate to save her husband - Lawson only wants to evade the police and get away.  What will Helen have to do to keep her family safe?  Unfortunately yet again we have a film where the female character could well have been stronger - and is played by an actress who certainly would have done the job as well - but here after being playfully demeaned by her husband and then roughly mocked and condescended to by the brutal Lawson she never really gets to show her stuff.  Not that one expects feminism in noir, exactly, or in any film from this period, but it surprises me to see Stanwyck in a role like this where her only choice is to use her feminine wiles - and even those don't seem to be enough to get the job done as she has to resort to pleading and crying.

Still, despite my ambivalence about the Helen character, I think the film is a pretty decent one, with not a moment wasted (in less than 70 minutes), a terrifically gleeful malevolent presence in Meeker, and a really terrific ending that does serve to redeem both the amorality of Lawson and the helplessness of Helen.  Fine location work and photography by Victor Milner help matters also.

So JEOPARDY is a thumbs-up, if not a really enthusiastic one, and TO PLEASE A LADY a mild thumbs-down.  All in all, worth it if you're a Stanwyck fan or a hard-core noir enthusiast; otherwise, probably not.",1258070400,2,4599,4.578048780487805

First of all, in To Please a Lady, she falls for Gable after he slaps, then kisses her.  Yes, it is a movie of its time, but I really don't think most women did that even then. Not a big racing fan, so those scenes were ok, but not enough to carry the film for me. In Jeopardy, again it was obviously a movie of its time, but she still had a lot of spark (which the convict found attractive), she wasn't weak and helpless (e.g. all the ways she tried to help her husband).  Women were encouraged to be dependent, but she tried hard to overcome that training when the chips were down. The movie had some real intensity, too.
