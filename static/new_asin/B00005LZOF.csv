1623800,5,B00005LZOF,"I caught this movie on the Hallmark Channel a few weekends ago and just couldn't stop crying!  But in a good way ~ there were sad parts , yes, but by the end of the movie you are just crying at the goodness of these people through the hard times.  James Earl Jones really was excellent in this movie & put great emotion into this role.  The faces he made were so powerful, he's just such a great actor.  Naomi Watts was beautiful in this and Kevin Kilner was great also.  I bought this movie right away after I saw it because this is a movie I want to watch each Christmas & share with others :-)",1133740800,7,596,4.05982905982906
1623801,5,B00005LZOF,"The gorgeous bookshelves in the study at the start of this movie had my attention and then the theme of clocks and watches was quite unique. Even if you have not seen ""The Christmas Box,"" you can enjoy this story. This sequel focuses more on the life of David and Mary and how they find one another and keep their marriage together.

Timepiece is one of those stories some will find hard to believe would ever happen in real life. Strange, yet true, not only did someone leave Christmas presents on our doorstep one year in real life, my brother also survived meningitis. So, two aspects of this movie made complete sense to me.

The first half is more of a love story and the middle is filled with tragedy. The ending is so beautiful in that the characters learn to forgive and by doing so, bring beauty back into their lives.

The true meanings of friendship, loyalty and love are also explored. The emotions at times border on being overly sentimental, but for the most part, the story flows nicely.

The beauty of this story is more in how the characters react to tragedies in their lives. They discover what it means to forgive and share their lives with those who have also suffered.

As many in America face a Christmas filled with the pain of loosing those they loved this year, I felt this movie could almost be a guide as to how we can turn our personal suffering into joy and hope.

We may not always understand why God allows tragedy into our lives. The story of Mary and David Parkin shows how when you look for ways to make other people happy, you can find joy again and can even learn to appreciate life in a more altruistic way.

1623802,5,B00005LZOF,"""Christmas Box"" is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I've been itching for the beautiful prequel ""Timepiece"" to come out. Told in the frame of reminiscence, this is the backstory of the dignified Mary Parkin of the other movie, and of her husband and daughter.
Kevin Kilner is astonishingly good as David Parkin, the owner of a successful company during WW2. David is a bachelor with odd social habits; among other things, his best friend is a black clockmaker named Lawrence (James Earl Jones, who is OBVIOUSLY amazing), considered an eccentricity in the upper crust of the 1940s noveau riche.
A young English woman, Mary Anne Chandler, arrives and somehow ends up as David's secretary. But he isn't yet aware that she has a secret: She's pregnant by a deceased soldier, and unwed, a major stigma at that time. David marries her nevertheless, and for a time they are immensely happy together. David considers her daughter to be his, and soon about five years have passed.
Meanwhile Lawrence befriends an elderly, kindly spinster with a wastrel nephew. When she dies, she gives all of her money to charities - except for a beautiful, valuable clock that she leaves to Lawrence. The nephew and his friends, needless to say, aren't too pleased. When the nephew shows up, drunk, there's a scuffle and he's accidently shot with his own gun. David dives in to take the blame, knowing that a court would try Lawrence unjustly. This good deed results in an outpouring of both love and hate, with tragic results...
I've only seen Kilner in one other role -- that of the first lead on Earth: Final Conflict--and was not impressed by his acting abilities. And, additionally, I was groaning in pain when I found out he had been cast as David; I thought he was all wrong for the part. This movie, however, lets him shine. Naomi Watts is excellent as the woman whose hardships forge her into a much stronger person, showing indications of the dignified older woman of ""Christmas Box.""
James Earl Jones is a jewel as Lawrence Flynn, an elderly black man who must suddenly deal with the prejudice of some of the town's residents, alongside his friend, Miss Maud Gannon. Jones is, needless to say, amazing. Richard Thomas doesn't really star -- he's in a cameo, at best, artificially aged, but it's a good cameo that sets up the whole movie. Mercedes Kastner, the girl playing little Andrea Parkin is pretty good for a child actor, but not stellar; at times she's a little too affected.
Flaws? Well, there are some dissimilarities to the book, in more than altered dialogue. In the book, Andrea was not fathered by a deceased soldier, but just some abusive jerk. Richard Thomas's gray artificial eyebrows look like dust bunnies, and he really isn't convincing as an old man. He looks like a young man trying to look old. The effects of the attack on Lawrence is much more severe in the book; but as there are children watching this movie, it's just as well.
Nevertheless, this is truly beautifully made. The sets and settings are amazing, and I get the feeling that the actors were enjoying what they were making. If you feel in the mood for a really lovely movie, or enjoyed the other movie, you should definitely watch ""Timepiece.""",1005436800,31,3223,4.746880570409982
7944665,3,B00005LZOF,As a stand-alone movie....this is not that enjoyable.  And in the end when you hope for a warm fuzzy feeling... it doesn't happen.  I have yet to watch the follow up The Christmas Box movie..maybe that will help fix this sad heart of mine..but on first watching...I doubt I will watch it twice.,1521849600,,294,4.528301886792453

7944667,1,B00005LZOF,"I was expecting a typical slightly slow moving but enjoyable Hallmark movie. I found Timepiece to be unwatchable. The script was ridiculous and the acting, especially by Watts and Kilner was wooden. I don't know how people see this as a worthy prequel to the Christmas Box.",1512518400,,273,4.829787234042553

7944672,3,B00005LZOF,"Timepiece is a made for TV movie and it shows.  It's probably only so well-known given the fact it stars popular actors.  I'm pretty sure I caught this movie on TV back in the mid 90's because it looks familiar.

A husband and wife (Kevin Kilner and Naomi Watts) fall in love during World War II times, and eventually have a child.  The movie takes forever getting to the point of the two having the daughter and spends WAY too long focusing on meaningless stuff in between that probably won't satisfy the drama-loving folks out there such as that wedding scene.  Talk about WAY too long.  I like in the beginning how Naomi was looking for a secretary job but kept getting nervous and trying to get away, but Kevin makes confusing jokes leading Naomi to think the boss isn't around and insists she stay!  Let's not introduce ourselves to a pretty lady awkwardly or anything Kevin!

The movie goes for a really elegant appearance which usually doesn't work for me and this is no exception.  The story is about their daughter contacting meningitis.  This is a MAJOR SPOILER but the girl doesn't die of meningitis which is a big storyline twist.  I think we all thought she would given the feel of the movie up to that point.  The rest of my review is a SPOILER so stop reading now if you haven't watched the movie yet.

Instead what happens is that Kevin's friends with James Earl Jones' character, but James is a black man who works on clocks in a white neighborhood so not everyone accepts him with open arms.  However he decides to keep a clock for himself based on certain circumstances with a female customer (and I just NOW get the irony when she said she has ""a bad ticker"") but unfortunately the woman's grandson (or son- I forget) has a problem with black men so he confronts James one night about the item in question.  This results in James having to defend himself and shoot the guy.

Kevin storms in a moment later.  When the cops arrive Kevin takes the blame.  While in court and being confronted with the situation, it's strongly assumed Kevin clearly did not shoot the man and is just covering for James.  The evidence presented is pretty accurate that James is the murderer (maybe a little *too* accurate- was the courtroom at the murder scene?)  However Kevin pleads his case and gets off... prompting the dead guy's angry vengeful friend to take revenge which eventually results in the death of Kevin and Naomi's little girl.  It's a big tragic change to a story that was quite dry and the opposite of violent in the first half.

The second half is a LOT better than the first.  I don't know if it's enough of an improvement to recommend the movie though.  Probably not.  Made for TV movies in the 90's haven't aged well.  However the relationship with James Earl Jones and the little girl is pretty good.  The acting is good all around, but these actors are working with an underwhelming storyline for the most part.",1466035200,,2934,4.549618320610687
