8082148,4,B000B64TVY,"This DVD Contains Two Episodes:
1. Journey To Secret Places
2. Aleph-Bet Telethon

Of the two episodes on this DVD, my kids really like the Aleph-Bet Telethon with Jerry Stiller and have learned a little about the Hebrew alphabet in the process.  Also has Joan Rivers, Nell Carter, and Itzhak Perlman.  You'll also see the full range of muppets along with the Israeli-specific muppets.  Remember, these are a bit dated (circa 1987), but kids still like them.",1190678400,7,458,4.909090909090909
