8177123,5,B000NDIB4Q,"""Goodbye CP"" is a heartrending film that every thinking person should see.  It's message is harsh, unadorned and transcendent.  The struggle of Yokoto Hiroshi to live his life in a world where throngs of ""normal"" people do not look at what they find unthinkable.  Though he is inescapably and embarrassingly present, he is also invisible.

There are moments of happiness found in a tangerine orchard.  There are moments of agony in which Hiroshi and his wife and son are beset by a film crew, intent upon showing the life of rejection and isolation that severely affected individuals face.  Hiroshi is helpless in the face of his own helplessness.  His pain is not merely palpable - it is excruciating.

The rough, overexposed images accompanied by a disjointed recording of the subjects' speech add to the stark, in-your-face refusal to smooth or sugar-coat the very real lives of these sufferers of Cerebral Palsy.  Though I saw agony, I saw little self-pity.  By the end of the 82 minute film, I began to be acquainted with the man inside the cruelly twisted body.

If you think you have problems, see this movie for a reality check.  Learn the meaning of courage, tested day after day.",1356048000,5,1189,4.8316831683168315
