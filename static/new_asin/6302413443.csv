457957,4,6302413443,"""The Bride Wore Red"", is MGM's 1937 Joan Crawford film, with Ms. Crawford as Anni, a cabaret singer (in the original play, a prostitute)in Italy who meets a wealthy man (George Zukko) one evening who is convinced that luck is the only thing guiding who is rich and who is poor.  He offers to test his theory with Anni as his guinea pig and she accepts, heading off to a fancy resort for two weeks and masquerading as a socialite, while the dashing Count introduces her among high society, planning to expose her cover at the end of the intended two weeks.

Anni meets Rudi (Robert Montgomery), a young wealthy gentleman who is engaged to Maddelena (Lynne Carver) but quickly falls head over heels for Anni and is ready to ditch his intended.

In the meantime, Anni also meets Guilio (Franchot Tone), the local postman and an all around good guy whose only fault seems to be that he's a simple man.

While we intuitively know that Guilio is the man for Anni, it takes her the entire film to figure it out.  But we are treated to beautiful scenery as she rendevous with Rudi, and spends some unintended time with Guilio.

It's interesting that this was the film that got Crawford branded as Box Office Poison back in 1938.  Overall, the film is quite entertaining and certainly no worse than some other MGM-Crawford offerings.  The film is ably directed by Dorothy Arzner and Crawford even sings competently.  She is dressed to the nines in this film, including in the aforementioned red dress.  She is photographed to perfection, and her real life chemistry with Franchot Tone (her husband at the time of the film) is apparent.  Robert Montgomery, her frequent co-star in the MGM days, is reliable as always - - although Montgomery always seemed more at home in slightly comedic roles versus those as the dapper gentleman.

Although the film was not a success at the time of its release, everything seems to come together and work fairly well.  For Crawford fans, the film is a treat of singing, beautiful gowns and the lovely Crawford herself.

A fun Cinderella story with a rags to riches theme and a basic message of not judging a book by its cover.",1142380800,6,2151,4.641160949868074
457958,4,6302413443,"This was made right around the time Crawford was labelled ""Box Office Poison"", and Joan seems appropriately humbled in her role as a  lower class dancehall girl (her character was a prostitute in the story this is based on). The storyline is practically on the level of a fairy tale, and I think it would be a better movie if it had been directed as one. Directer Dorothy Arzner doesn't seem to know whether she is making her movie for adults or moonstruck teenage girls. But because Crawford always gives 100%, the somewhat uneasy result is still worth watching. Those who just watch her films to gaze at her unbelievable bone structure will not be disapointed here--she is photographed beautifully and lovingly--almost as if the film makers were struggling to compensate for the threadbare plot by supplying an overabundance of Crawford's physical appeal! Sporting a sleek, long hairstyle that is unusually becoming on her, Joan looks very modern in this. Only a few years before ""Mildred Pierce"", Joan still has something of her former girlishness here, and has some nice moments. Her song ""Who Wants Love"", while overlong, flatters her voice more than her singing usually does, and I always think that she looks somehow like the dead girl from ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" as she's singing it. I think they were trying to make her look slightly pale and circley-eyed to denote someone who never sees the sun, but she almost looks like a zombie! (albeit a glamorous one). Soon enough, Joan is in furs and Adrian gowns though, as she is sent to a luxury hotel by a millionaire for no apparent reason other than to see if she can pass herself off as a lady. Think ""My Fair Lady"" with half of the plot removed! Crawford performs wonderfully in a scene where she recognizes her chambermaid as a former dancehall friend--the two women giggle girlishly, embrace and chatter most convincingly, and it saddens me to see Joan this good in a movie no one will see! Of course, she does have her stagey moments too, but any fan of Crawfords will hardly be put off by that!  Although this movie is technically a misfire, I would have to say it's in my top 10 Crawford films because she is so lovely and interesting in it. She really rises above the material and creates a performance that is fun to watch.",1106870400,12,2295,4.706467661691542

457960,3,6302413443,"This little 1937 flick - which was directed by talented, underrated Dorothy Arzner - found its origins in a play entitled THE GIRL FROM TRIESTE by Ferenc Molnar. The film takes place in the beautiful countryside of Italy and has Crawford play a  less-than-virtuous cabaret singer (named Anni) who's been invited by a wealthy aristocrat (George Zucco) to spend a Cinderella-like two weeks at an exclusive resort at Tyrol.  Hoping to convince his snobby friends that anyone can appear to be a memeber of the upper crust if provided with the correct trappings, Zucco introduces Crawford as a mysterious socialite, secretly knowing that he will expose her true identity as a common tramp to them at the end of two weeks.  At the resort, Crawford plays the role to the hilt, making a gentleman (Robert Young) fall in love with her...Crawford and Tone were married in real life when they filmed this little trifle which boasts beautiful scenery and a fairly entertaining storyline. Crawford once remarked half-seriously: ""I'd like to think that all my directors were all a little in love with me - I know Dorothy Arzner was!"".",1030579200,2,1120,4.915343915343915

7825130,4,6302413443,"Anni (Joan Crawford) is an ambitious singer in a seedy bar. Fortune falls into her lap when a wealthy drunkard comes in an offers to let her live the life of luxury for two weeks on his dime. She jumps at the chance, and begins calling herself Countess Vivaldi.

She goes to a ritzy vacation spot to begin her masquerade, and she meets the town postman (Franchot Tone) who is rather friendly and agreeable. Then she meets Rudi (Robert Young), a rich playboy with a fiancee and an appetite for beautiful countesses.

Anni begins to formulate a plan to make her masquerade permanent by marrying Rudi, but she must overcome her background and her romantic desire for the postman.

Crawford's hair is ridiculous, but otherwise she is supremely beautiful in this film. She is also a superb actress, which makes her a magnetic screen presence. There is a scene in which she is crying, and I truly believe in her sobs.

This shoot was not particularly pleasant for Crawford and Tone who were married but separated. They barely spoke off-camera, so it is no wonder Crawford's pain comes through so clearly on the screen. Interestingly, in spite of their bitterness toward each other, Tone and Crawford have incredible chemistry, and that makes for a very entertaining movie.",1285804800,3,1266,4.820276497695852
7825131,5,6302413443,"I love this movie. Joan plays Anni Pavlovitch, aka Anne Vivaldi, a penniless chorusgirl pretending to be a society matron in hopes of snaring a rich man at a posh Swiss resort. Joan acted beautifuly in this picture. I always loved it when Joan played regular girls because her characters were always so natural and sweet with a devilish streak, like in this picture. Didn't Joan look so beautiful, too? One of my favorite pictures with Ms. Crawford from the mid/late 30's.",1192665600,4,472,4.7682926829268295
