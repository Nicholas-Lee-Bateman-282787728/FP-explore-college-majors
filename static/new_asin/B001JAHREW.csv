3654124,4,B001JAHREW,"If I had just started with this season, I would not have continued.  The writers for whatever reason, decided to make some of the characters (Andy) dumb.

3654280,5,B001JAHREW,"This is the best tv show ever! It shows how police officers are in the real world. A lot of people have an idea that they are callous and hard hearted. But the real truth is that they actually care.  Every time I watch an episode I have tears in my eyes by the time it ends.  To Protect and Serve is their motto, but that doesn't do the profession justice. Sometimes it's a hard job, but they do it anyway. I wish everybody in this country would watch this series with an open mind and an open heart and try to understand.  I was married to an officer for many years so I know firsthand.",1459296000,,587,4.043103448275862

We do like watching it without commercials and also for the ability to watch a few episodes at the same sitting. It makes it very convenient to follow the characters and story lines...Jeff D.",1458000000,,302,4.315789473684211
3654443,3,B001JAHREW,They are running out of ideas. Only six more seasons (130 episodes) to go.  I still like to watch it when nothing else is on that is worth my attention.,1458000000,,152,4.066666666666666

3654513,5,B001JAHREW,"I watched NYPD Blue when it first aired and enjoyed every episode and I have recently gone back to Season One and have worked my way up to Season 6. I will watch the rest of the seasons too. I love the cast. Detective Andy (can't spell his last name) is my absolute favorite. I have watched his character change and grow with each season. Since daytime TV has nothing to offer, I am enjoying Amazon Prime and Netflix to watch old favorites like NYPD Blue again and some other TV series that I missed due to scheduling conflicts. If you missed NYPD Blue, you will not be disappointed if you take the time to watch it now.",1456531200,,620,4.262711864406779
3654514,5,B001JAHREW,NYPD Blue was wonderful the first time around and I appreciate it now even more. The entire cast was superb and two of my favorites were Kim Delaney and Austin Majors.  Theo was a scene stealer! Dennis Franz was genius in his potrayal of Andy Sipowicz and his struggles to become more than he was. This series is highly recommended.,1456531200,,332,4.533333333333333

3654622,5,B001JAHREW,"This was a huge transition season for the series.  Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) falls ill and dies, which are certainly among the most powerful episodes for the show.  Danny Sorenson (Ricky Shroder) comes on to replace Bobby with tension between him and Diane Russell (Kim Delaney) as Diane tries to recover from the loss of Bobby.  Of course, the season wouldn't be complete without another tragedy for the squad as Asst. District Attorney Costas (Sharon Lawrence) gets shot to death in a courthouse, leaving Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) alone to take care of their child and hopefully avoid any fallback into alcoholism.  This certainly ranks among the top 3 seasons for the show.",1454976000,,680,4.991150442477876

3654625,5,B001JAHREW,I've always loved NYPD blue as NY.C is about 2 hrs from me and the episodes mirror the living and attitudes of New Yorkers to a degree. Makes me feel right at home but NY doesn't really have that much crime so NY is a safe place to visit. Though back in the 90's you didn't want any expensive watches and jewelry showing. Since Mayor Guliani the city is still a great and clean place to visit.,1454630400,,393,4.116883116883117

3654627,5,B001JAHREW,"You can't beat this series. Timeless. Except for  Sipowitz and his hair styles, it is a classic. Like Archie Bunker, the difference being Andy is much smart in some ways and not so much in many others. LOVE IT!

I, like many other fans was shocked and dismayed when Bobby Simone left the cast and as a result I resented his replacement, which ""colored"" my opinion of the actors work.  Now, as I watch this, I realize that not only was the character Danny Sorenson played well, it was one of the most difficult roles in the series at that time.

But then NYPD was always exceptional television. It is a shame that we do not have the same quality of shows on now. These first few episodes will bring a tear to your eye but also give you hope for what love can be. Jimmy Smits and Kim Delaney were the perfect couple. The only other show that I can think of that had such good writing was White Collar.,1445644800,,495,4.15625

3655150,5,B001JAHREW,"I think NYPD BLUE has become lost in history because of the fact that it had a very few scenes that barely showed any skin. Thank you for the warning as I didn't need to see Dennis Franz's butt. Yet I did. There it was. Moving past the sky Blue reputation, this is a fantastic show centering around one of the finest characters in the history of dramatic TV, Andy Sipowicz. Throughout the series, he has a bevy of partners from David Caruso to Jimmy Smits to Rick Schroder and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (so, he basically paired with the guy from CSI: Miami, LA Law, Silver Spoons and Saved by the Bell) and transformed from a racist, drunk who was inches from being thrown off the force, to a loving husband, ex-husband, father and husband again (to Charlotte Ross in her physical prime - man, sign me up!). When asked to name the show that most resembles real life case solving, real loife detectives and police officers chose NYPD Blue by a mile. (SPOILER) Season 6 marks the end of Jimmy Smits runom the show. His death still brings tears to my eyes. This is a fantastic series featuring one of the two best dramaric characters in the history of TV (Vic Mackey of The Shield, IMHO, is the other).",1435276800,,1193,4.4520547945205475

Two major big impact events--one expected and one totally unexpected--bookended the season, but in between...too much emphasis on personal problems in the squad, the virtual disappearance of James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) except in the opening credits, and now-you-see-her and now-you-don't with Sylvia Costas-Sipowicz (Sharon Lawrence).

3655350,5,B001JAHREW,"NYPD Blue is a well-written, often humorous look at the day-to-day life of a New York City police precinct.  It is sometimes gritty and the nudity and language, though tame by today's standards, pushed the envelope when it first aired.

Though the casual watcher can certainly enjoy watching a single episode, there are rich layers to be discovered by beginning this series at Season 1, Episode 1.

When the series originally aired on TV (in the last century!) I was a frazzled mom with two kids under 5, and even when I did discover and begin watching--early in Season 6--the show was sometimes hard to follow and I realized I was missing some vital history with the characters.  From that first episode I saw, I was hooked and began watching each week.

What a treat it is to  go back and watch from the beginning.  I was watching one show a night on satellite TV, because that is all I could find....until I became an Amazon subscriber.  Now, I can watch whenever I care too...which is the beauty of a series being on Amazon.",1427587200,,1028,4.548913043478261

3655467,5,B001JAHREW,"I always give seasons of ""NYPD Blue"" five stars, because every season it was on it was the best program being broadcast on network television.

Season 6 is riddled with sadness and loss.  First, Bobby Simone falls ill and dies.  Diane Russell struggles all season long to cope, and Sipowicz, even in his own grief over the loss of his partner, has to break in his new partner, Danny Sorensen.  The last half of the season is consumed with the degeneration of the squad's PAA, Delores Mayo, who falls to becoming a junkie and a prostitute, finally to be murdered by an excessively wealthy and prominent trick, who serves her a hotshot of heroin just to watch her die.  This thread culminates with the horrifying death in the courtroom hallway of Andy's loving wife, ADA Sylvia Costas, played by the always delicious Sharon Lawrence, who shines in every role she ever plays but never better than here.

This is the saddest season, and therefore it is my least favorite of the whole series (there's enough sadness in real life without having so much of it in my fictional entertainment).  I am sure that many people, with less deliberately childlike tastes than mine, will consider it to be the best season.  It is also the most emotionally evocative and stands head and shoulders above anything else commercial television has ever presented in terms of drama, scripting, direction, casting, and cinematography in a city setting.",1425945600,,1426,4.839506172839506

The acting is high caliber and the stories from the professional staff writer/producers Steven Milch and Steven Bochco, are equally well done.  But IMHO it's Bill Clark former NYPD Detective who relates his own accounts and fills-in the spice of real-life action, or in some cases dull days, that make this series a cut above anything else at the time or since. And what Dennis Franz does with his character Andy Sipowicz is just terrific IMHO....",1425081600,,538,4.712765957446808

3655542,5,B001JAHREW,"Every season of this show was 5 stars in my book, but this season really tipped the scales in TV excellence.  Dealing with the end of Jimmy Smits (Simone) could have been done with a few episodes, but they showed all the pain and suffering that goes with what Simone was dealing with.  Must admit that we were teared up like most viewers, but the show must go on.  I really thought that it was the end of the show, and along comes Rick Schroeder who simply blew us away.  No, his is not no 'Bobby Simone' - no one will be - but those are hard shoes to fill and he did it almost seamlessly.  This is simply one of the best TV Cop shows EVER.  I think that the political correctness and PTA moms have squashed us from seeing shows this good on network TV these days.  Guess that is why cable networks like FX, AMC, Showtime, HBO, etc are making the 'really good and gripping' TV shows these days.",1417824000,,894,4.162790697674419

You get the police action and personal life stories of the characters.

3655729,3,B001JAHREW,"Really quick because I don't have much time to devote to this particular review.

I hung in there for 5 full 22 episode seasons and Season 6 was the one that did me in. Simone's death was the sucker punch after the uppercut of losing Kelly (David Caruso). Rick Schroeder? At first I was like.. OK, this could be interesting. But the show lost me. The marathon of time and emotional investment that goes into watching, trusting, and then loving a show, only to have it become a clearing house for what basically seems to me to be a bunch of on-screen acting auditions.

I gave up around the middle of Season 6 and won't be coming back.

3655730,5,B001JAHREW,the best police series for me. fox holds out on selling the series too long and they won't be able to sell any people will find it on amazon prime,1396396800,,146,3.9

3655732,5,B001JAHREW,"I watched this series for years and really enjoyed the program. I believe what I like best is the depth of the actors, you feel like

3655733,5,B001JAHREW,"This season brought so many changes to characters of the 15th Squad. Bobby, Andy, Diane, Jill, Lt Fancy, Greg, Detective Martinez all feel sadness, loss and new challenges to meet, personal and professional. Danny is introduced and finds his niche with a genuine heartfelt presence the squad all come to realize is refreshingly sincere and they quickly adapt to, including his somewhat resistant new partner.  If you follow this series with interest this season of NYPD Blue will not disappoint.",1396137600,,495,5.1875
3655734,5,B001JAHREW,NYPD Blue still remains my favorite TV series ever. Season six is a heart wrencher - but one of the powerful qualities of this show was how the Loss of a major character was diminished by the next character up. Although my favorite combination was Bobby Simone and Andy Sipowicz the series never lost my interest.,1395964800,,313,4.607142857142857
3655782,5,B001JAHREW,"NYPD Blue is easily high up on my All-Time-Top Ten list of worthwhile TV series. Steven Bochco and David Milch created a real-life gritty police drama with innovative (hand held camera) techniques and very high production values. The 15th Precinct ""house"" looked as I imagine a precinct HQ would look like. Attention to detail in every scene -- using toilet paper to dry hands in the unisex bathroom in place of the always-missing paper towels. The cops are recognizable as everyday guys, working stiffs in a hard job. Imagine being a street cop in NYC. And the detectives aren't pictured as geniuses. They're just a step ahead of the skels and smart enough to figure things out. Story lines are always crisp and the show's pacing moves the story along with no waste. Even though the cast changed many times over the duration of the show, the show's identity never did. Cast changes were seamless, thanks in part (big part) to Dennis Franz who anchored the show flawlessly, even though his character, Sipowicz was mightily flawed. NYPD was Dennis Franz's finest moment..
It's a pity that all twelve seasons weren't released as DVDs. I snapped the first four seasons up as soon as they hit the market and luckily, I had taped the full run when it appeared live on network TV back in the day. . .so I have all of the episodes.

I'd like nothing more than to see these brilliant producers re-surface with additional seasons given their ability for assembling actors and writers with same esquisite talents.",1380499200,,815,5.889830508474576

3655934,2,B001JAHREW,"First off I want to say NYPD Blue is one of my all time favorite shows.  This is not a rating of the season itself, per se, but a rating of it's presentation on Amazon Instant Video.  The first five episodes of season six are among the best written, directed and performed of any episodic televison series.  I think it is the pinnacle of NYPD Blue.

Unfortunately, on Amazon Instant Video there's serious flaw in what is the best NYPD Blue episode, ""Hearts and Souls"", which as you probably know is Jimmy Smits last regular appearance.  This episode originally aired as a 90-minute episode, so it should run about 63 minutes without commercials.  On Amazon Instant Video it runs only 46 minutes, which mean a hatchet job was done on the editing.  It is, in fact, the syndicated version of this episode.  This not to say Amazon.com is necessarily to blame.  This is apparently how the episode was supplied to them by the Studio(or whoever currently owns the show).  However, there is no warning about that anywhere on the site.  No efforts seem to have been made thus far to correct it.  The editing of this episode completely ruins it by eliminating the entire subplot, and even a small portion of the main plot.  I don't know if this is the case when you download the episode or the entire Season 6, but was certainly enough to prevent me from buying the season, as I had originally planned on doing.

This is a serious error that needs to be corrected by Amazon.com ASAP.",1380067200,,1473,4.551330798479087

3655965,5,B001JAHREW,"NYPD Blue was always keeping its audience on its toes with unexpected changes, new characters, and the relentless evolution of the character of Andy Sipowicz.  Season 6 is no exception, as this was one of the most shocking (and highly rated) seasons in the show's run.  Not only do the twists and surprises continue throughout these episodes, but they also tie into the progression of Andy's character as he assumes the full series lead after the departure of Jimmy Smits.

Anyone watching TV in 1998 surely remembers the publicity this show got out of the storyline about Bobby Simone's illness.  Every day, the ads reminded viewers that the countdown was on for the exit of Smits, and the fans tuned in.  After seeing ratings drop for three straight seasons, NYPD Blue nearly got back into the top ten with Season 6.  As a heart condition relentlessly weakens Bobby, Diane and Andy must struggle with his inevitable loss.  Dennis Franz and Kim Delaney both show incredible depth as actors as they portray the grieving process of their respective characters.

Season 6 is a difficult bunch of episodes for any fan of this show to experience with Smits deciding to leave and his character written out with such a painfully slow death.  The shows are beautifully written and acted, with Bobby frequently having dreams/visions centered around his old pigeon-keeping mentor, Patsy.  Smits, Dennis Franz, and Delaney all give tear-jerking performances that are some of TV's best examples ever of dramatic acting.  The characters and viewers mourn the loss of a favorite character together, and the squad, just like the TV audience, is gradually led through the transition from Smits to Rick Schroeder's Danny Sorensen as Andy Sipowicz's partner.

The first six shows are emotionally very heavy, but the tone shifts back somewhat lighter once Bobby passes and Danny comes into the squad.  Some funny moments pop up as the old characters respond to a new personality, Sipowicz in particular.  I always thought Schroeder did a fantastic job in this role, offering a completely different character from Simone, but one who's compelling to watch for his own reasons.  Sorensen is much more fragile than Bobby, but every bit as likable, as Diane soon finds out.  The first hints at their future relationship are seen by the end of the season, but like the transition from one detective to the next, this is a gradual process.  I'm a big fan of every season of NYPD Blue, but for obvious reasons, Season 6 is one of the most significant and important in the show's history.  For any fan, these are must-see episodes.",1377388800,,2605,4.922196796338673

3655967,5,B001JAHREW,"This is one of the best seasons of this show and probably the last one to deserve five stars.  We get the gut-wrenching death of Bobby Simone at the start of this season.  You can't watch it and not get a little weepy. Then, Rick Schoder joins the cast as Danny Sorenson. He's not bad , but he never really grew on me. This season is about loss for sure. Andy loses his second wife Sylvia in the finale. Dennis Franz is a superb actor in this season. Wow!",1377302400,,455,4.101123595505618

I do not watch TV now, and did not watch TV then, and think I may have seen a few episodes of this with friends or ?
Amazon is great, no commercials, and watch the series on your time!
Anyway, keep a lot of water near by. It seems like they catch you off guard.
I hope the next 7 years can keep up the great writing and acting up to season 6.
There a lot of shots of the Trade Center. The series is a great lesson on human relations, true to life drama at the ""house"" and a historical view of life in New York City mid nineties.
This series continues to be TV worth watching.

This show evoked many emotions for viewers.

It is heart retching, desperately sad and this time when he got the dentist's cut, I had to say adios and move into the episodes past the grief.  The Simone character was such a strong aspect of NYPD Blue.  I really liked the Danny Sorenson character.  It was difficult to move into Simone's role.  But Rick Schroeder kept on swinging.  I always felt that Dennis Franz  should have been the #1 lead in NYPD Blue from the very beginning.  It wasn't after Smits left that Franz's identification was realized.  Andy Sipowitz was the glue that made NYPD Blue work from 1993 through 2005.  Ultimately, I was extremely disappointed that Smits had to leave the show.",1366329600,,756,4.574626865671642

Couldn't take Shroeder at the time.  But am giving it an honest viewing now and look forward to the rest of the seasons. Job well done Amazon!",1365984000,,483,4.528735632183908

3656042,5,B001JAHREW,"Dennis Franz does a remarkable job of continuing to develop his character and show the inner struggles through nuanced behavior.

It is wonderful to see this cast really start to bond much more deeply than ever before.  Lt. Fancy's character has become much more human and while Sipowitz has always been out there on the edge another dimension of ""edginess"" has emerged.  I am so glad that the PA John was brought back to full time and we are enjoying seeing his character grow and open up more.

They stopped putting it out on DVD with Season 4 so I have been streaming Season 5 & 6 via Amazon. It's a really enjoyable cop show with good characters. It's a little outdated and less violent when compared to today's shows.

Some of these wonderful episodes were originally aired in a 90-minute timeslot instead of the standard 60-minute slot, with a bunch of extra scenes. In the Amazon Prime library, some of the episodes have been retained in full-length. Unfortunately, this one episode, ""Hearts and Souls"", probably the highest-rated of all episodes in the show's amazing 12-year span, was one 90-minute episode which was NOT retained as such. In subsequent airings in syndication, a 60-minute version was used. To my dismay, and that of every true NYPD Blue fan, the Amazon Prime library catalogs the 60-minute version and not the 90-minute version.

I hope that somehow Amazon Prime can restore the original 90-minute length to this episode, since it has done so with the other 90-minute episodes.",1339545600,,869,5.163120567375887

You might not believe a 15-year-old can fully appreciate the complexity of such a show, but boy has it stuck with me. That was 5 years ago and I am still in love with this show though I haven't seen it in years. Recently I acquired the first 2 seasons and have whipped through them. The show is complex, with truly great characters. It feels so much more real than the contrived shows on today like CSI. I can only hope one day I'll be able to own all of this great show, and believe me, this show is worth buying.g",1266883200,,595,4.094017094017094
3656077,5,B001JAHREW,"I don't have many reviews, but felt I had to write this one. I would like to see all the NYPD Blue seasons released on DVD !!!!

I currently have seasons 1 thru 4 on DVD. This is by FAR one of the GREATEST TV-Series to ever air in the 90's. Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) is my hero. David Caruso did a GREAT job with his character John Kelly as well. Wonder if he ever regrets leaving the show, I hated to see him go. Which is one of the reasons I acquired the CSI Miami seasons on DVD (another GREAT show). Jimmy Smits did an outstanding job of replacing Caruso after he left the show, as well as all the other cast members.

My only gripe, which is a very small one, wish the DVD's were 1.78 widescreen. Not sure if the original shows were shot in WS. If they were and these DVD's were Pan & Scan, I think they should re-release all seasons in 1.78, or at least any that were shot in WS.",1245801600,,888,4.011299435028248
3656078,5,B001JAHREW,I would be willing to pay in advance if that is what it takes.  I don't understand why season 6 has not already been released....,1238457600,,129,4.16
3656079,5,B001JAHREW,"""NYPD Blue"" (like ""St. Elsewhere"") is a masterpiece of literate television storytelling which needs to be released in its entirety, but I would really appreciate the opportunity to pick up with Seasons 5 and 6 in 2009 to complete the ""Bobby Simone"" (Jimmy Smits) years. Of course, the ""Danny Sorenson"" (Rick Schroder) and ""John Clark Jr."" (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) years enabled ""Andy Sipowicz"" (Dennis Franz) to develop into one of television's most celebrated characters / actors.  Indeed, I suspect that together with its strong supporting cast ""NYPD Blue"" may be one of the strongest ensembles for television drama since ""St. Elsewhere"".  Everytime I reflect on this show's achievements it makes me pine for it more and more.  The question is...After so so many fans out there requesting further dvd releases, is it enough for Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment to act on???

P.S.  As of October 12th, 2009 still no word for a Season 5 and 6 release, however, I do understand that some of the major studios are opening up their catalogues using the Manufacture On Demand concept.  Please, Please, Please TCFHE!!!! Please make Seasons 5 and 6 of this crowd pleaser available MOD.  Be rest assured, there are many of us who will pay up front for this title.",1229990400,,1261,4.976190476190476
3656080,5,B001JAHREW,"NYPD Blue fans, our silent vigil continues. I can only hope that the creation of this Season 6 page means that there is light at the end of the tunnel, that this series will finally be released on DVD.
This is the king of TV dramas in my view, and it's stunning that it hasn't made it past Season 4.

I'm begging you people, please release this!",1229126400,,345,4.149253731343284

Hey Amazon!! Where did NYPD Season 6 go???  I just started it about a week ago, tried to pick up on Episode 4 last night, and AV tells me it is not available to buy or rent???  What's up with that?
