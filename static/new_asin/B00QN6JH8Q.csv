6877247,3,B00QN6JH8Q,"The Packaging makes it look like fetish porn but it's not. I bought it for White Slave, a good movie if you like the italian jungle survival genre. It's pretty soft compared to Deodata's work, but it is what it is...kind of like Jungle Holecaust meets Blue Lagoon. Let's face it, you don't want to whip out Cannibal Ferox when you bring your date home, but if you hide the package you can get away with this one. There's no sex in the whole thing, but guys will like the topless blonde and girls will like the whole ""romantic savage"" thing that guy she hangs out with has going on. The picture quality is terrible (felt like I was watching an old VHS) but it didn't stop me from enjoying the film. I wish it wasn't 30 dollars, and you may want to wait until it's cheaper but I was filling a hole in my collection.

Caligula Reincarnated...I honestly didn't finish it, but it was late. I'll get back to it someday. Lots of nudity but not porn, more like an honest attempt to portray Nazi shenanigans against Jewish women. Not at all sensationalised like Ilsa, not arousing and not intended to be. Just plain weird, and cruel...kind of like the holocaust itself, I guess. Seemed to be exploring some kind of love connection between a guard and a prisoner, but I fell asleep. I fell asleep on The Night Porter too. Nazi's just aren't my thing.

1 star for obscurity, 1 star for weirdness 1 star for giving me two movies on one disc, and 1 star just for being italian, minus 1 star for packing it like porn. Bad transfer is just par for the course.",1092700800,38,1544,4.357638888888889

I thought pornoholocaust was bad,but this movie is worse! Save youself the money and time!",1501027200,,260,4.117647058823529
8692167,3,B00QN6JH8Q,My DVD was  a little blurry. Movie was OK. One woman had a kind of up close full frontal. There were other full frontals but they were quick flashes or far away. There were also some topless women. Overall I'd have to say I was disappointed with the movie.,1500940800,,256,4.224489795918367
8692168,4,B00QN6JH8Q,"I haven't watched ""White Slave"" yet. Only the first 30 minutes or so. I got a little excited when ""Radar Rider"" started playing on the soundtack and the girls parents were murdered,but began to lose interest. My loss of interst, however, is most likely attributed to the fact that the other feature on the double DVD is so much more twisted, brutal and un-politically correct that ""White Slave"" doesn't matter to me. In fact, I only oredered this item to add ""Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler"" to my collection.
  ""Last Orgy of The Third Riech"" was the orginal title of this Italian gem, but the film was rereleased under the ""Caligula banner"" by Penthouse Video in the US, along with a series of movies that I won't get into as I have to get to the point of my review. However, I never say ""have you seen, or let's watch Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler"". ""Last Orgy of The Third Riech"" just has a better ring to it and is more suitable for the content contained within.
  The content. Sick,yes. Tasteless, definitely. Offensive... ah!, come on! What else did you expect? This film is absolute depraved garbage! Which is a good thing, if that's what your looking for. I usually am. Regardless of what title is used, you have to know what your getting yourself into. First off, it's an older Italian flick (if only Fulci diected this one) so you can expect a lot of ridiculous, obviously fake, but charming gore. Secondly, it's an erotic film about nazis! Need I go on?
  In all honesty, from start to finish, this film leaves much to be desired. It really slows down after a certain point. It's worth it,though, just to check it out. It will, without a doubt, offend and nausiate about 90% of the people that watch it. If you can put aside your morals for a while, or embrace the lack of them, then watch this movie.
  I will not ""SPOIL"" anything for you, but the ""dinner scene"" is totally out of control! Borrow,rent,download,buy this movie if only just for that.",1264723200,,1963,4.572649572649572
8692169,4,B00QN6JH8Q,"These movies look like some kind of weird porno from the cover but the movies are compeltely different and the people on the cover have nothing to with the movies themselves. These are older movies from the 70s and 80s.

I bought the movie for 'white slave', a true story about a girl who gets captured by tribal people on the amazon because i heard it was a true story ...It was a good movie. It was almost like a documentary type movie and tells about how this woman was captured and had to live with natives and become accustomed to their culture and try to escape from the jungle. The captors in this movie aren't cannibals but they have some pretty weird customs. Some parts were gruesome but its mostly just a story about what went on and what this woman did to survive in the jungles and get revenge on the people who murdered her family...Also what became of her.

This dvd with a movie called 'Caligula recincarted as Hitler'- '1977' which was an INSANE movie. This was just wrong. Its about the nazis and a nazi captain that is trying to drive this one woman crazy and she won't break. She will do anything to survive and eventually he ends up taking a liking to her, well, 'as much as he can', then the ending.

Its like a reinactment of a prison camp and a love story in one. It was disturbing but I cant say it was completely 'bad'. It was a decent film. This movie was on a thin line between telling a story and exploitation. I couldn't tell for sure if the purpose of the movie was to tell a 'story' or to indulge some kind of fantasy.

""Warning""- Ironically there was cannibalism in this movie but not horror type of stuff. There was also every other thing you could think of. Weirdest movie IVE EVER SEEN. It was graphic, disturbing, weird. 'Extreme stuff''- not for the faint of heart and many may be very offended at this.",1195257600,7,1841,4.343023255813954
8692170,2,B00QN6JH8Q,"If you are sensitive to The Holocaust, then this is one exploitation film that I would avoid. Taking it's cue directly from ""The Night Porter"" it tells the story of a beautiful blonde named Lise and her lover, a former SS commander and head of a concentration camp. Turns out the two met when Lise was bought to the camp as a prisoner, and it was only after subjecting her to countless physical and psychological tortures that the commander finally fell in love with her. The atrocities that went on in the camp form the basis of the film, and are told in the form of extended flashbacks.

Now, unlike other Nazi romps like the Ilsa films and ""SS Experiment Camp"" or ""The Beast in Heat"", this is one film that you really can't watch for laughs or titillation. The atmosphere is surprisingly grim, and it's not just down to any graphic violence. What marks it out is that it doesn't shy away from the historial fact that the Nazis were exterminating Jews and the script goes to some length to point this out during many of the torture and sex scenes as the Nazis constantly deride and humiliate the inmates with reference to their Jewishness. It adds a distinctly nasty edge to the film, one that is not helped by the most notorious sequnce in which the Nazi dignitaries decide to liven up a banquet by cooking and eating one of the semi naked inmates who has just fainted after a particularly nauseating (and long) rant by one of the more fervent diners on the subject of how the Jewish people should best be utilised to serve the ""greater Germany"". Removed from the old UK ""video nasty"" videe version,  this sequencee is undoubtedly the most chilling part of the entire film, but it's not the nudity or death that causes it, it's the hatred and disregard for the Jewish race that is painted so vividly in this scene. The fact that the actors are only average performers for this kind of genre film, plus the English dubbing is terrible, only seems to highlight just how offensive this script actually is.

For it's most part, the film exists mainly to show the attractive heroine in various states of undress and either being subjected to or witnessing many acts of cruelty and torture. To break her spirit, her best friends are murdered in front of her. She is sexually degraded, and hung upside-down over a cage of rats. A Nazi guard taunts her with clothing and ornaments made of skin and body parts of dead inmates. All the time she sinks further and further into a comatose state which allows her to withstand the nightmare, until the camp commander finally admits defeat and takes her on as his lover. The film ends with the flashback portion finally revealing Lise's ultimate tragedy, as well as how she has managed to stop herself from going totally insane in the years that came after it was all over.

Filmed with some degree of competence, this is actually a fairly well made movie. Whether it's enjoyable or not is dubious. The fact that the film uses genuine documented stories of Nazi behaviour at the death camps as inspiration for sexsploitation is quite sickening in places. The re-release titled as ""Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler"" presents a terrible full-screen version of the film that cuts off several key parts of the picture all the way through, and adds a specially filmed title sequence featuring a pouting model wearing an SS party outfit...oh lordy. At least they kept the original theme music, and it appears to be the long uncut version. The old UK video was slightly letterboxed but missing the banquet scene. I haven't seen any other releases, but if someone dares bring out a wide-screen remastered DVD version in English, that would be the one to go for, if you think you can take it.

NB I haven't watched the other film on the double pack ""White Slave""",1182124800,9,3790,4.633928571428571
8692171,3,B00QN6JH8Q,"""Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler"" was a good rape, terror, and torture movie. There are some sexual violence scenes that are too brief. As the other reviewer said, beatings, whippings, gang raping of women prisoners, dipping naked women into vats of lime, and hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats round the good scenes out. If you're a fan of sicko movies, this will get you off hard.  At times the movie is a bit slow, as I found myself wanting to see more abuse and humiliation and degredation rather than scenes where nothing happens.  (The intro care ride scene is boring, and just reminded me of a recent car accident I was in.  Buit I digress ... ) I haven't watched ""White Slave"" yet but will when I can.  I have great expectations for more sick, disguisting fun! - Matt Mazzuckelli",1152057600,6,827,4.530201342281879
8692172,4,B00QN6JH8Q,"Good stuff , I think I enjoyed White Slave more than the other.",1151884800,2,63,3.923076923076923
8692173,3,B00QN6JH8Q,"While both movies are entertaining in their own right, I thought I would mention to buyers and viewers out there that the film White Slave is also under the title of Amazonia: The Catherine Miles Story. You can find this DVD here on Amazon from the Shreik Show label. This DVD shows more gore than the White Slave, which was the US release of the film. This film also wanted to use the title of Cannibal Holocaust 2 to promote larger sales, however, this did not happen. The movie itself is interesting as it is a supposed true story (not much on the internet about it, other than sales of the movie).

The Caligula film was interesting, however, it seems to serve to show Nazis who are interested in degrading women while stripping them naked. Perhaps instances happened, however, it was always my impression that Nazis elites actually avoided as much violence as possible so as not to be stimulated emotionally. They just gave orders, never did anything themselves. Otherwise, its a good exploitation flick. I like White Slave better.",1141516800,32,1036,4.7555555555555555
8692174,5,B00QN6JH8Q,"As a ""kind of sewer"" of these Italian sexplotation flicks, Capt. Freaky knows a good film when he sees one!  The first of this dual DVD, ""White Slave"" was not worth watching or mentioning for any reason.  Piss poor special effects of beheadings...no sex in the film whatsoever...and nothing to make anyone horny or subsequently enjoy themselves.

On the other hand, the second film, ""Caligula Reincarnated as Hitler"" was way better than what I expected.  Just the exceptional location of Northern Italy's lake district gives it one star.  Furthermore, the young blonde star of the film is gorgeous and someone both men and women would find attractive to sleep with.  There are some five star sexual violence scenes that are unfortunately too brief.  Beatings, whippings, gang raping of women prisoners, dipping naked women into vats of lime, hanging the young blonde star nude and upside down over a box of live rats!  I mean, hey you ""sicko"" Nazi fans, is this something or what?

There are no actual hard core sex scenes, however, there are multiple simulated sex scenes that are quite hot to watch.  I think there is significant sexual tension in scenes throughout this very good storyline.  If you are into the whole ""Nazi sex slave camp"" thing....this is by far, the best of that genre I have come across.  And because I only paid $9.99 for this double feature...it makes it a 5 star film for me by all catagories.

I am curious if there is an unrated or extra cut film out there of this, as another reviewer hinted at?  If so, and they showed more actual sex, that would be the one to purchase.",1132012800,22,1600,4.688172043010753
