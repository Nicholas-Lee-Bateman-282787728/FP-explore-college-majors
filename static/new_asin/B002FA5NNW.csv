3921212,5,B002FA5NNW,"Japanese films have always had the remarkable reputation of turning the simplest premise into something so full of moving emotions and sensibilities. Yojiro Takita's multi-award winning film ""DEPARTURES"" (2008) is no different. There is a lot of excessive hype surrounding the film as it has almost nearly swept the Japanese Academy awards and has been awarded the Best Foreign film honor in the recent 2009 Oscars. No film can live up to the hype it has gotten, but I have to say it has earned each and every recognition; well deserving of the commercial success it had achieved in its native land.

Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player whose dream is shattered when the orchestra he is playing with goes broke. Left with no choice but to sell his prized cello, Daigo together with his wife Mika (beauteous Ryoko Hirosue) returns to his hometown to live in his mother's old house.  In need of a new job, Daigo responds to an ad in the local paper for a job in ""Departures"", thinking that it may be related to travel. But much to his surprise and dismay, Daigo discovers that he had applied for a profession as an `Encofineer'; a man who performs the delicate and traditional Japanese ritual of preparing the bodies of the deceased for the departure to the next life--it pays quite well, and without even thinking about it, he accepts without even giving his wife the details of his new job.

It is not often that we become privy to a film about the beautifying of corpses, director Takita takes on the grim subject matter and gives it a commercial charm and appeal. The direction is quite meticulous in exposing the world of the mortician as we become witnesses to the Japanese customs and traditions as to how they deal with their dead. Takita shows that the profession demands a certain amount of sensitivity as we see the different reactions of those left behind by the deceased; some are angry, some are funny, most are overwhelmed by grief and some are curiously joyful. In Daigo's profession, there are no religious affiliation; they do what they do to preserve the memory of the deceased, remembering them as the way they used to be and not who they are in the present.

It is a safe bet that a premise such as this may be unusual even for Japanese audiences and one of the film's key to success is the way it executes its grim subject matter through some doses of subtle humor in the film's first act. Writer Kundo Koyama and the direction by Takita meticulously eases the premise into the audience, as we were privy to Daigo and Sasaki's encounter with an extra ""thing"" to a supposedly female corpse. We see Masahiro Motoki's deadpan humor as he becomes repulsed by his first job, and just how he eventually becomes comfortable with his new career. Takita cleverly illustrates the short moments in the ceremony that our morticians get to know the deceased quite intimately.

After everything sinks in, then the emotional scenes begin to take hold, as we learn more of Daigo's childhood, his problems with his wife's disapproval of his new job and his anger towards his father who had left him while he was a child to run off with a younger woman. Now this is a commercial film and we know that eventually people close to Daigo will eventually come to respect what he does for a living, it is a little predictable but the journey with which the film gets to where it wishes to go is well-played that the screenplay becomes somewhat of a melancholy with a rhythm that just looks so beautiful. Mika (played by Ryoko Hirosue) is just so lovable as the diligent wife; she is just so full of love and trust that her character represents the goodness within the Japanese woman. It was touching to see Daigo perform a ceremony in his wife's presence and director Takita carefully manipulates the camera work to show pure emotion. Takita also injects some sequences that are beautiful to awaken the emotion (sort of serves as a vanguard) as we see Daigo playing the cello on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams. The film also has beautiful cinematography and emotion-inducing score to match its otherwise simple but grim premise to keep the film running at a brisk pace.

The film has two significant scenes that seemed to induce quite a few sniffles, they were injected to give a twist that plays a significant part in Daigo's life. The first one does provoke a lot of emotion; it is full of tear-inducing sequences that can definitely touch its audience. However, it does feel a little overlong that the second twist may lose some of the narrative impact to the inexperienced viewer. The two twists do work in unison in the screenplay but some may argue that Takita was working too hard to induce emotion working one twist right after the other. I didn't find anything wrong with it and I thought it stuck to its sensibilities in reflecting just how life can sometimes throw you in for a curve.

The performances are quite good, Motoki (who won best actor in Japan) and Hirosue has some dynamic chemistry between them and the supporting characters made up of Sasaki, Yuriko (co-employee played by Kimiko Yo) and the woman (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) who runs a bath house plays their own significance in the script. I loved the way Yamazaki played Sasaki, it was like a cool and quiet boss as he always seemed to say ""its fine.""

Despite some flaws in the screenplay that the film came dangerously close in becoming too sentimental, ""Departures"" is easily one of the best commercial films to come out from Japan. The last act will leave an impression that no matter how we see ourselves and others, death sometimes is the one thing that can bring a family together. The film's biggest ace would have to come from its ability to induce the proper emotion at the right minute with such simplicity. Such critical acclaim will no doubt raise the film to unreasonable expectations, and while it may not change the face of Japanese cinema, it is not pretentious and never hides behind its beautiful visual style. The way to approach this film is with tempered expectations, so that the film can touch you in its journey that is both surprising and pleasurable.

Highly Recommended! [4  + Stars]

The 2-disc region-3 release looks great and sounds great. The 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen video transfer is vivid and clean. It also has a 5.1 DTS Japanese language track. Subtitles are well timed and translated. I am unsure of what is being sold in amazon however.",1249257600,5,6486,4.680701754385965

3921214,5,B002FA5NNW,"This 2009 Japanese film, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign language film of that year, is not to be confused with a Canadian same-titled travel tv series.  As the story (Kundo Koyama) begins, a young Tokyo cellist, Daigo (Masahiro Motoki), who considers himself no more than a moderately talented musician, suddenly finds himself unemployed.  His orchestra has been disbanded. His recently acquired world-class instrument, purchased on credit, must be returned.  As the only thing he owns outright is his mothers home in the small rural town of his birth, he returns to that setting with his sanguine, supportive wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue), hoping to find employment.  Thinking he is applying for a job at a travel agency as the ad features Departures, he discovers that thats not at all the case, and reluctantly, fearfully, takes on the job of encoffineer, one who ceremoniously prepares the body of the deceased for entry into the next world.  His boss and guide, Ikue, is brilliantly played by Tsutomu Yamasaki.  And here, this extraordinary film opens into a mind-filling, part philosophical/psychological, large-part reality drama /love story with splashes of comedic wit. Add to that, the influences of Japanese culture and tradition in a contemporary world. How Daigo acclimates and internalizes this often socially scorned and disdained profession is exciting and compelling.  The storyline embraces death in a uniquely comforting, albeit surprising way. The cello performances are heart-awakening, the cinematography bracing. The whole production is exquisite and seamlessly crafted. Writing, directing, acting, music, filming, editing, all are in  synchrony and exceptional.  For a mere $3.99 rental fee, the film is definitely worth the splurge!

My husband was slower to warm to it, but half way through, he fully enjoyed it and was very glad he watched it. So even if you do not love it in the beginning, stick with it. Death is a topic we need to talk and think more about, and this is a very good springboard for those conversations, as well as being a beautiful story and film.

We were not able to finish watching the movie at that time, but planned to pick up where we had left off at another time. When we went back to watch the movie, we learned that it was no longer available on NetFlix, so I decided to purchase the movie for him as a sentimental gesture since he very much enjoys foreign films - and being such a beautiful story and that we both loved it so much, it was worth the purchase so we could finally watch the movie in its entirety together!

3921279,5,B002FA5NNW,"Departures is a movie which involves the viewer in an ancient Japanese tradition of the honoring of the dead and the deceased's family and relatives.
By using a story line approach instead of a documentary one, the viewer, who is not familiar with the Japanese culture or this tradition, is drawn into this elaborate procedure and ceremony by viewing a young man who has lost his job.  The young man is married and needs to provide for his wife.
The man applies for a job, an ""encoffiner"" (Nokanashi).  He has no idea of what this word means or entails.  So he becomes educated, as we are at the same time.  His reaction is probably what most viewers may initially experience; dealing with dead bodies is not a vocation easily chosen.
The movie handles this conflict in a remarkably careful and satisfying manner; in fact, for this viewer my reaction was one of appreciation for this cultural tradition and especially for the compassion for the surviving family and relatives.",1470355200,3,976,4.791666666666667

3921299,5,B002FA5NNW,"""Okuribito"" (""Departures"") was one of the hits of the 2009 Seattle International Film Festival. I heard nothing but raves about it, so obtained the DVD from the city library. I had to wait while hundreds before me enjoyed it. Now I have my own Blu-ray from Amazon.

This is a tale of a contemporary Japanese cellist whose orchestra folds for lack of financing, so he has to find a job. He takes his perpetually sunny wife to his childhood hometown so they can live rent free in his deceased mother's house. As he scans the want ads, he sees one about ""Departures"" that includes the magic words, ""No experience necessary!"" Of course, he sets off immediately, thinking it must be a travel agency.

He is hired and has accepted an advance on his pay before they explain that the ad had a typo; he will be helping prepare corpses for their departures to the crematorium. He is horrified but really needs the money, so he avoids telling his wife the exact nature of his work.

To me, the most interesting thing is the cultural difference in the way the deceased are cared for in the Orient. Professional encoffineers do the work that we here in the Occident expect from the mortician: they cleanse the body, fix the hair, shave and apply makeup. Furthermore, this is done in full view of the family, albeit tactfully masked from their watchful eyes with ingenious draping throughout the process!

As I watched this elegant ceremony I was struck by the calming effect and the respectful grace these professionals bring to what could be an emotional gathering as they quietly prepare loved ones for their final farewells. I appreciated the different attitudes they encountered from those widely diverse families. The first scene is hilarious as our neophyte encoffineer encounters a surprise under the masking drapery: the lovely woman he has been preparing turns out to be an entertainer...a drag queen!

We admire the skills this fellow acquires and hope his wife gets over the shock after she discovers what he does for a living. In addition, we learn about stone letters; these add an important and touching element to the story.

The music is delicious. The cello arrangements range from Mozart and Handel to ""Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop..."" This is in Japanese with terrific English captions. The interview with the director also has captions and I think you will find it educational...I know I did.",1463702400,2,2402,4.8321167883211675

Rating = ****
Director:  Youjirou Takita
Producers:  Yasuhiro Mase et al.
DVD
2008

Film = four (4) stars in all departments.  Director Youjirou Takita leads a team of film makers who undertake a very careful, detailed, and emotionally moving depiction of the lives of undertakers (starting with initial motivations to enter the profession).  The arts of the mortician as dramatized in this photoplay include skillful bereavement  psychology, ceremonial showmanship (there is a not-so-subtle link to live theater acting), facial makeup (again tied to acting), and ""encoffinment"" of bodies in caskets (with various price points).  It is also shown to be a profession typically despised (death is far from a popular subject matter in Japan and elsewhere) until services are required (marked by an abrupt 180 degree flip in attitudes).  Direction and acting are across-the-board exceptional and continuously address this morbid subject in an upbeat manner.  Nonetheless there is a drift here and there into the maudlin due to slow-paced scenes.  The overly-long production does not help matters either.  Cinematography (semi-wide screen, color), lighting, and editing are excellent.  Surround sound field is mostly fine.  Original score (there are also some short selections from classical compositions) is also excellent with deeply resonating and haunting leitmotifs.  It is performed by a very large orchestra (which is shown in action early in the film).  A highly-recommended Shochiku Company release.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1453507200,,1590,5.637130801687764

3921366,5,B002FA5NNW,"My first movie review on Amazon.  I was debating between 4 star and 5 star as my friend recommended it and set the expectations super high. but honestly, it deserves a 5 star. FANTASTIC plot and directing. It was a bit slow (as most japanese drama movies), but the emotions as an audience were evolving greatly. it started funny, then uncomfortable, then sexy, then the sadness, and meaningfulness, then anger, but mostly goosebumps, the heart-touching goosebumps.  My biggest takeaway is the bath house lady's gentleman friend ""gatekeeper"" ' gateway theory and how regretful people are after they see someone important passing. It is so important to treasure every moment n treat the ones you care with true emotions and true actions, so we are not going to have regrets once they are gone. Thank you Amazon for having this movie! (I initially signed up for Hulu and realized they don't have it so I was really glad Amazon has it for $2.99 only.)

3921380,5,B002FA5NNW,I found this movie to be very moving and rather entertaining as well.  Be forewarned that it is in Japanese with English subtitles - so don't buy this video if you're bothered by English subtitles. I happen to be fine with subtitles and if the movie is good - as this one is - I soon find that I forget that I'm reading them as I get wrapped up in the story. This is the story of a Japanese man who accidently accepts a job in the funeral undertaking business.  Apparently this profession has traditionally been considered to be a rather shameful one by Japanese values. They often deal with this subject with humor - and there are more than a few laughs to be had here. Later the movie concludes with a very moving segment in which the protagonist deals with his own grief at the loss of a loved one. (No spoilers here!) The production values of this movie are a bit weak in a couple of scenes but the fine qualities of this movie more than make up for it. A must see if you like movies that are different than the usual fare!,1433635200,4,1027,4.208121827411167

Maybe they can't handle what is coming to us all Death. I don't need to say much there are plenty of reviews for that. Go to youtube.com and watch clips of it, and if it doesn't interest you then go watch Transformer or something. This is by far the best Japanese film I have ever watched. I love it, even my sadly extremely jaded relative of my thought it is a good movie. She usually fall asleep in over 99% of all the movie she attempted to watch, but she was awake without me paying her to watch for once. Warning you may cry because it is such a beautifully written movie and the acting was superb. There are light and comical moments, so It is not too depressing.

The dialogue tended to be short and so was quite comfortable reading the subtitles.  I have to say I was blown away by the incredible facial expressions of emotion by all the actors in this film.  Fine acting in what I would call an unusual subject matter - preparing of the deceased.  I do not know if this is the actual procedure in Japan, but the unbelievable sensitivity demonstrated and portrayals were over the top, leaving me with streaming tears.  Having said this, if you've lost a someone recently, wait some time before viewing - although regardless it will not fail to elicit a response from you.

We have shared it with many friends and tell them, ""don't be repelled by the theme of funerals and death, or the subtitles"" - and they never are disappointed.  It is the powerful story of a an unemployed cellist who becomes an undertaker and develops a respect for life by dealing with death on a daily basis.  He faces challenges in his own life with his non-supportive wife, a father who abandoned him, and the stigma of working a job that traditionally has been performed by the ""unclean"" castes.  But the lessons he learns and challenges he overcomes bring him to a new understanding of the precious gifts of life and love.  The soundtrack to this film is hauntingly beautiful and will make a cello-lover out of anyone.  The film is in Japanese with English subtitles.

3921458,5,B002FA5NNW,"The subject is death and life that feeds on dead things to live. e film is gripping, shattering scenes of casketing, insights into forgiveness of those closest who have betrayed or hurt one horribly.

Humor, but pathos, regrets, questions revived again about the meaning of death, the value of a corpse, the need for more reverence, more connection with the dying in order to be a completely forgiving human being. The film makes the idea of war more horrible than usual. Japan's history of the Hiroshima and  Nagasaki bombings operates here as a subtext to the laying out of the dead, something that could not be done after the nuclear attacks in 1945..This film accuses Japan for its lack of care for person-hood, and other countries, the USA for sure, children abandoned, and the physical self, the presence of another person in their body is sacred, as is the body itself after death. There can be no war in a world that desires peace worked at everyday, like the way bodies are every day transformed into a kind of angelic beauty in this film for their passage into eternity.

This film is an antidote for the desecration committed against the human flesh for decades now, witnessed in the vast numbers of untreated dead, numbers that stagger the imagination and have damaged  faith and hope.",1403913600,2,1297,4.776785714285714

3921472,5,B002FA5NNW,"A masterful Japanese film that shows you something different - the Japanese funeral rite - while also delving into multiple complex characters. I really don't exactly know what to compare this to, as the formula really doesn't exist anywhere else. The actors are warm and charming - perhaps a bit too much so - but even if the melodrama leaves it a touch away from believability, it's a fantastic tale that is very well told. The actors in the film are all huge names in Japan, and the acting is pretty solid.

Starting off, we get to see firsthand the somewhat bizarre and stylized funeral rituals that the Japanese have developed; each culture has its own way of seeing loved ones off, of course, but what we see is indeed interesting, unique and peculiar. ""She's got a thing."" Of course, at some funerals there can be confrontation as family members use the peculiar circumstances to vent, or gush, or just generally find a way to reveal themselves, and we get a bit of that here too - mostly for entertainment value, as it doesn't further the story. Then, after a good deal of introductory stuff, we drift away to examine the back story of a failed Tokyo person retreating to his country home to meet this demons, and fall into a new career. ""I should have realized the limits of my talent.""

Of course, all this doesn't matter when he finds his true calling at a mortician's's firm, where the hours are short and the pay is good, but the circumstances may be gruesome (and the social stigma may be sharp). The interview is short (""here's today's salary""), the CV not necessary - it's the look that counts - and within hours he's part of a frightful scene. But it gets better. And worse, as family roller coasters start rolling - seems he's not so good at keeping his wife in the loop when making family decisions - and we get a bit of village life, sento life, general nostalgia. The couple lives in an old sunaku, with his dad's old vinyl albums. The boss of the funeral business Mr Sasaki (played by veteran actor Yamazaki Tsutomu, who got his start in Kurosawa films) is eccentric, but a great chef and a pretty good philosopher of life: ""Even this (meal) is a corpse. The living eat the dead.... unless they're plants. And so, if you don't want to die, you eat. And if you eat, eat well."" Great scene as he bites into an exquisite piece of food. ""So good, I hate myself."" Great dialogue!! [strangely, Yamazaki hardly speaks again through the rest of the film - fading into the twilight as his apprentice takes over]

The opening is replayed, dramatically, with new context, and more great scenes. ""He may dress as a girl, but he's still my son!!"" The looks between old friends at the bath house auntie's funeral are exquisite, especially when the wife (finally) sadly sees her husband in action and sees something (finally) to admire, something she'd never quite expected. Wow! And let's not forget the scenes with the crematorium uncle, and the revelations of the ""stone letter"". Many very meaningful scenes throughout this film, great cello music, and wonderful acting. Watch it!

3921501,5,B002FA5NNW,"Departures is an academy award winning Japanese language film that revolves around the concept of death and how society reacts towards it. The story revolves around Daigo, a cellist who has dreams of becoming a professional musician in the orchestra. When the small orchestra he is a part of is disbanded, however, he finds himself without a job or any way of supporting himself or his wife Mika. In order to save money, the couple decides to move back to Daigo's hometown and into his old childhood home. While looking for work, Daigo discovers an ad in the paper that he thinks is for a travel agency only to find out that the job is actually for funeral services. Desperate for money, Daigo takes the job and tells his wife the job is for a travel agency. The film shows how society views working with the dead and yet how important the task is as well as how reverently it is handled. The film takes on some dark subject matter, but it does so with an intermingling of humor that creates a balance that makes the movie exquisite and completely deserving of an Academy Award for best foreign film.

One of the best parts of the film, however, comes from the amazing score. The music throughout the film is hauntingly beautiful and inspired. It is composed by Joe Hisaishi who has composed music for several of famed Japanese director Miyazaki (i.e. Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, etc.). Hisaishi is a master composer who creates breathtakingly beautiful pieces that fit the story so eloquently.

I had to watch this film for a college sociology class on death, grief, and caring. I was apprehensive at first since it was completely in Japanese and is not dubbed so you have to read the subtitles. In the end, however, I'm truly glad my professor chose it because the story is exceptional and will make you both laugh and choke you up. The storyline is beautiful and I strongly recommend not letting the fact that it is a foreign film discourage you from checking it out and giving it a chance; you'll be truly glad you did. I'm not usually the type of person that likes foreign films or even really indie films for that matter, but this movie has made me want to give them more of a chance in the future.",1379116800,,2242,4.560794044665013

I enjoy just about every film I've seen, but even some fun ones aren't great. But this movie, Departures, speaks to me in a way no film ever has. I was born and raised in Japan, so the scenery alone brings back memories, and feelings. The directing is phenomenal, with nothing ever feeling like it was rehearsed or planned out, but as if it's just life. The acting was superb, being superb by going from goofy, fun characters to serious individuals who go about their lives in a very strict manner. But while all of this may be great and award-worthy, it was the musical score that was the highlight. The main character, who wanted to be a cellist, doesn't have enough money to continue playing, so he moves to his old town and works with ""departures,"" those who have passed on. But this does not keep him from playing his music, and when moments of peace arise within the film, or a time of serenity for the character, the beautiful score kicks into full gear, and it will grip you tight.

Departures is one of the best dramas ever made, one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best films of the decade. I would have to say, this, Remember Me and Pursuit of Happyness are the best dramas I've ever seen. A must-see for anyone who watches movies, but not for kids.

3921525,5,B002FA5NNW,"First on purchasing...
The price was right for this movie since it is quite difficult (if not impossible) to find in-stores.  Although at one point the movie trading company told me they could order it, I prefer using online tools so that the items are shipped directly to my home.  This product came when promised and was packaged properly, with no defects.

Now on to the important stuff...
This is one of my all-time favorite films.  My husband and I rented it on a whim when it was first released and were always glad we did.  I was recently looking for reviews on other movies (it is so hard to find something with a real story and little to no sex, violence, ghosts, demons, vampires, etc. these days) when I was reminded of this one.  Luckliy Amazon had it!

Departures is very touching and well acted.  The main character, Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is very expressive and entertaining to watch.  You can really see his emotions in his face and body language.  He really begs for your empathy for his plight and fosters a deep adoration for him in the midst of his triumphs and failures.

Although for me this movie is a real tear-jerker, it is not the kind that leaves you exhausted at the end.  It is so full of hope, love and forgiveness, I feel very peaceful every time I watch it, with an appreciation of the relationships I have (with all their ups and downs).

I believe there is a little something for everyone in this movie as it focuses on all types of relationships... husband/wife, mother/child, father/child... and the loss, turmoil, redemption and forgiveness that each relationship can have.

Parental guidance notes:
This is really a movie about adult relationships... I'm not sure that many (younger than their 20s) would appreciate it as much, as it deals so heavily with complex and sometimes painful relationships.  However my teenage daughter did watch and enjoy it.

There are scenes that include a public bath house and in a few of these scenes you can see various people (including the main character) nude, from the side.  Nothing explicit is shown and although I do not approve of nudity in films, I was not offended by any of the scenes in this movie.  In fact in one with the main character, he is washing himself to remove more than just physical dirt and I believe was a good way to show what he was going through at that time.

There is also a touching scene between the husband and wife where she thinks that he is trying to be romantic with her in the kitchen, which she finds inappropriate and a little frightening (because of his intensity).  However the scene is really not about sex, it is more about the tenderness and affectionate needs he has for his wife (and needs from her) at the time.  That being said, it is not something I would find appropriate for most children/teens to watch as they could not possibly understand what is really going on.

I highly recommend using IMDB to research specific parental guidance topics before watching any movie.  There is a detailed one for this movie, which I found very helpful the first time I watched it.",1370131200,2,3104,4.624087591240876

The film provides a wonderful opportunity to discuss many spiritual topics.",1364860800,2,384,4.746268656716418

3921538,5,B002FA5NNW,"This movie may not be ground breaking (as per NYTimes Review).  Certainly not in a worldly sense,  but it is absolutely soul breaking.  Healing families.  Preparing cadavers is much a martial art, just as the art of tea ceremony.  Departures is a timely movie. Encoffinment is, as are many other traditions, a dying art in Japan.

It doesn't surprise me that so many Americans like this movie so much. It is not written or directed in the intricate and edgy style of new Japanese cinema; it's instead closely related to standard American drama movies full of cheesy details, tired formulas and overacting.
Parts of the story such as the way the dead are buried make a difference in our perception; given that the ceremonious preparation is not an American standard we as viewers get a glimpse of a different culture that makes us feel like we are watching something more elevated than the standard drama. We're not. This is just another little bag of old tricks that just kept making me roll my eyes like in my best days as a teenager; they had shown and mentioned the stupid rock so many times that it was just obvious that he would find it in his dead hand.
It is not the worst movie that I've seen because I've seen so so many, but I don't want to see it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody that truly appreciates hard working directors that don't resort to images of hurt puppies to make a point.",1357948800,3,1217,4.413333333333333

3921549,5,B002FA5NNW,"Okuribito (Yojiro Takita, 2008)

Okuribito, released in English-speaking countries as Departures, was Japan's entry for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2008; one cannot call its win a surprise in any way. This is, for about one hundred fifteen minutes of its one hundred thirty minute length, an impeccable film in every way, sincere and heartfelt and warm and funny and entirely in love with the world. And while the last fifteen minutes don't quite live up to the first bit, they're still good enough to warrant calling this one of the best movies to come out of Japan--or, for that matter, any country--in the past decade.

Plot: Daigo Kobayashi (The Bird People in China's Masahiro Motoki) is a cellist in a struggling Tokyo orchestra...which folds just after Daigo basically mortgages his life away financing a new cello. Desperate for money to pay off the debt and unable to make rent on his Tokyo apartment anymore, Daigo and his wife Mika (Hana and Alice's Ryko Hirosue) move to Daigo's ancestral small-town home, which his mother left to him after her death. Perusing the local paper, Daigo finds, and answers, an ad for a company called Departures, assuming they're a travel agency. Instead, he finds, they are ""encoffineers"", a sort of mortician whose job is to prepare the recently deceased for burial. It's a low-caste job, universally reviled, but when Daigo hears the salary, he takes the plunge while putting up a front to his wife that he's actually the travel agent he thought he would be when he left home that morning. He's not too sure about the job at first, but over time, he comes to love the work, giving the dead the same passion he gave the cello--but what will happen when his wife finds out what he's doing for a living?

The end of the film dives straight into Hollywood shameless-emotional-manipulatgion territory; the film sets up a somewhat artificial ""Daigo comes to terms with his childhood"" scenario, and then executes it (albeit flawlessly). By that point, however, I was more than willing to give this movie a pass in just about any way necessary; it had already done everything I expect of a great film, and had done it all with honesty, integrity, and grace. Hard to believe he got his start in pinky film (he directed multiple films in both the Molester Train and Groper Train series), but there ya go. He's come a long way, baby. **** ",1355529600,3,2385,4.767554479418886

3921553,5,B002FA5NNW,"This is not a movie about death. Death, and Japanese custom surrounding washing and preparing the deceased in the presence of the bereaved family prior to disposal of the body, draws you in with its novelty and gentle dark comedy before subtly transitioning into a study about love.

Expect no sledgehammers; the dialogue is Spartan and can hardly be said to be explicit about the real subject matter. I'm not even sure that love is mentioned, but it progressively fills the eloquent silences and transports the viewer into the shoes of the protagonist as his new profession, which initially repelled him, opens him up to his own capacity to empathise with the mourners. Those who have passed on aren't lifeless meat: they have touched those around them--those who are only sad because they are filled with the presence of one so highly vital and valued.

Through observing their love, his own ability to love becomes enhanced, and this is why he comes to love his job, why his disapproving wife comes to accept it, and why he eventually becomes reconciled with his estranged father when it is almost, but not quite, too late.

It's almost perfect--but could have done with having about 15-20 minutes carefully pruned here and there, especially towards the end. I'd give it 4.75 if I could--but it's as near a 5 as doesn't matter. Watch it. It will help you evolve.",1350777600,,1365,4.8

If you don't like subtitles this may not be the movie for you, but it you're not opposed to the subtitles I would recommend this movie.

The plot is tight and the Director interweaves humor with the drama.  You learn something about Japanese culture without being beat over the head.  You can easily identify with the characters despite language and cultural differences because this film highlights our basic commonalities.  I think is is one of the reasons I so enjoyed it.

3921566,5,B002FA5NNW,"I have long been a film fan and Departures now ranks in my top five all time best.  it won a controversial best foreign film Oscar in 2008 despite mixed to poor critical reviews.  However, it was a major hit with film-goers in Japan.  One cultural nuance is that the people who prepare the dead for cremation in Japan are viewed with disdain since the dead are perceived as unclean.  Hence, a movie that elevates this profession to a noble level is culturally shocking in Japan.  The star is an ex-boy band leader, not a professinal actor, and so it is remarkable from that perspective as well.  The original score is gorgeous and is centered around the cello, a symbol of both the female figure, and the closeness to one's body when it is played.  The cello has also been mentioned as the instrument closest in pitch and volume to the human voice.  There are many ironic elements in the film such as the focus on eating (apparently, people who do this work become ravenous afterwards!).  Many of the scenes are exquisitely shot and remind audiences of classic japanese landscapes.  Some of the plotting is predictable and a little trite such as the symbol of stone letters.  Nevertheless, these can be forgiven when the whole is so superbly crafted.  A true work of art!",1336348800,3,1271,4.625

3921569,4,B002FA5NNW,"I don't think the Japanese are good film-makers but this is probably the best Japanese film I have seen. It took me limb by limb eventually breaking my emotions down by making me understand just how Japanese emotions work and by the time the film ended I was wiping my tears for fear of someone walking into the room seeing me. But trust you me, this film is better than just being called a tearjerker, its difficult to describe. The lead actor MASAHIRO (very popular Japanese name) is just terrific. There are so many things I had never quite thought about before watching this film. They are still going on in my head and come out in the form of conversations with others.  ""is your present ideal job really your ideal job?""",1335312000,,726,4.5
3921570,5,B002FA5NNW,"I really enjoyed the DEPARTURES DVD! It's really a moving story about accepting change and letting go of the past. If you had to encapsulate the Buddhist teachings into a single phrase it would probably be something like ""embracing impermanence,"" and that's what this movie shows.

In it, the main character Daigo Kobayshi (played beautifully by Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player who loses his job when the orchestra has to shut down because of low ticket sales. He has to move from Tokyo back to his small hometown, where his mother left him a house, and he finds work as a  ""Nokanshi,"" which is a person who prepares the dead person for the journey onwards. They're kind of like morticians only they do the work in front of the deceased person's family. He keeps his job secret from his wife because it's a shameful occupation, since they basically make money off the dead, and he's haunted by his hatred for his father who abandoned him a long time ago. His wife finds out about the job and wants him to quit and find something else. Towards the end, Daigo finally understands that his position is not shameful, along with others who ostracized him when they found out about his job, including his wife, and they realize that he performs a function that not only helps the grieving families, but also gives dignity to the dead. He's also able to make peace with his father -- when he's faced with the father's death -- and Daigo finally embraces change, which then allows him to fully experience life.

The movie is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is gorgeous with the Cello its main instrument. It's in Japanese but there are English subtitles.

Here the director talks about the Japanese custom of preparing the dead and how this story idea came from the leading man (Masahiro Motoki) a while back, but it took this long to get the story off the ground. He also talks about the challenges they encountered because of the subject matter, since he didn't want the film to be too melancholic.

The film won the Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"" and it would have been nice if they included the Oscar clip of the director and crew winning the award, but it isn't here. However, Takita describes that moment in the interview.

Again, although the film does deal with death, it has a sad but light feel to it. I guess hopeful would be the word, since it shows grief, but it never comes off as gloomy. There are some very touching scenes, but they don't come off as schmaltzy or contrived. I highly recommend this movie.",1333929600,,2667,4.665245202558635

3921572,5,B002FA5NNW,"This has to be one of the saddest movies EVER!  I love Asian films, they are definitely not Hollywood films where everything has a happy ending and you know how everything will end.  I saw the film first on Netflixs then just had to have it.  If you appreciate other cultures you will enjoy this movie.  I don't want to say much about it because then I'll tell you the movie and if you see it you will know what's going to happen.  If you like tear jerkers and don't mind subtitles, love classical music, enjoy a good story line, you will absolutely love this movie.

3921573,5,B002FA5NNW,"As others have so aptly stated, many words cannot convey the beauty of this definite masterpiece of a movie.
One of the greatest movies, I believe, of the last 50 years.  Finally, a recent movie without any weapons, no chase scenes, NOT action-packed, NO buildings exploding. It's about peace, forgiveness, a hidden sense of a supreme being behind the reasons of LOVE for the only operating principle of life.
I would give it ten stars if I could.

When will the world learn that beyond all the spiritual and humanitarian reasons for gentleness, mercy and love...that the practice of violence is extremely low taste.",1328227200,28,616,4.913461538461538
3921574,5,B002FA5NNW,"This is a movie about acceptance. The protagonist was a cellist, and lost his job in a symphony at the city. He went home to his birthplace, a small town, and accepted a job as a person that prepared the dead (put clothes and make-up) for burial. Its a thankless job that the Japanese society disdains. Though the job paid well, the antagonist felt ashamed and had to hide his job from his wife and his childhood friends which in turn generated plenty of comic and tragic situations. In seeking resolution to his childhood and new dilemmas, the protagoist finally received the ultimate enlightment by preparing his long-lost deceased father for burial. This is a very well-done movie, it trancends all cultural boundaries because who hasn't in life that hasn't seek understanding and acceptance from our fellowmen for our own thoughts and actions. This is the reason why it received the BEST FOREIGN PICTURE OF THE YEAR at the 2008 Oscar.",1326067200,3,938,4.832298136645963

A young Japanese couple struggles to make ends meet and he applies for a job that sounds like it might be for a travel agency.  It is, however, preparing bodies after death.  I do not have the words to describe the depth of emotion, the tenderness, respect and understanding of the human condition that this movie conveys.  It is superb.

3921577,5,B002FA5NNW,"I had originally watched this in language lab for university--I wasn't sure what to expect, and to be honest, the description doesn't do the movie justice. I grab the movie because it was long and I needed to get my hours in and I sit down at a computer in the crowded lab. The people around me must have thought I had lost my mind. One moment I'm trying my best not to laugh hysterically, the next I'm doing everything in my power to keep from balling my eyes out.

This movie was undoubtedly one of the best I have seen. This will take your heart, evoking emotion after emotion and throwing it all together into a beautiful masterpiece. The best way to describe this, would be to say it celebrates life. I would recommend this to anyone and encourage everyone to watch it.",1325116800,4,774,4.375

Good storytelling, with the lessons of life weaving their way through the various characters in this film, especially if you've gone through/going through a death in your own family.

3921585,5,B002FA5NNW,"I see I am the 16th person to review this wonderful movie and the 15th to give it five stars. That says something surely.

The protagonist, a young married Japanese man who makes his living playing the cello in an orchestra, returns from Tokyo to his home town in the mountains after his ensemble goes bust. There, desperate for work, he finds employment as a man who ""encoffins"" dead people.

We learn there is a a whole ritual for the treatment and preparation of the body after death. It is done with such quiet dignity and grace that it comforts the mourners and does full justice to the human worth of the deceased.

There is a quietness and strength about this movie which looks death in the eye without flinching and yet celebrates life. The human interplay of the various characters is first-rate and the film, despite its subject matter, is never depressing.

I found a lot in common although there are many differences too between the Japanese and Jewish rituals of caring for the dead. Both respect the body and person of the deceased and try to give death its due while still focusing on the fact that life must go on.",1314489600,4,1130,4.551724137931035

3921587,5,B002FA5NNW,"This tale of a man who relies on his hands to express himself, cellist and encoffiner, begins with an exchange of ""stone letters"" between a young Japanese boy and his father.  So among other things, it's a story about touching things --and people.
Death becomes palpable in the viewers' eyes as does food eaten with the same hands that just dressed a corpse. We are touched as well when one of the stone letters reappers in the final scene to tie up an unexplained departure -- and heal it. Another painful separation is aborted by a pregnancy.
Likewise, death itself may not be forever, but merely a ""gate"" to the next thing. All quite a touching -- and respectful -- film, deserving of its Oscar.",1311984000,2,698,4.584

3921590,5,B002FA5NNW,"Departures features several smaller stories telling one larger.  There's by far the most screen time for Daigo, a young man who leaves his profession as cellist in order to be a caretaker of the dead.  Basically, he prepares the dead for their loved ones to view.  Because he knows his wife will dislike his new career, he tries to keep it secret.  He is also troubled by the unresolved bitterness resulting from his being abandoned by his father.  It is a major transition the protagonist is to make, and that is why this movie is very fun to watch.

I was awed.  Although many of the scenes are of moments resulting from death, it isn't a dramatic portrayal but is uplifting, comedic, and respectful.  It is evident that Daigo admires and respects his new employer--the head honcho in this business.  He seems to see him as a father figure.  The scene of the employer enjoying a nice meal is my favorite.  The employer is really my favorite character, and I recommend this movie to anyone.  Its theme is to always follow your heart, and accept others when they do the same, even if it's difficult for you to understand at first.  If it's something that brings joy to other people, it is worthwhile.",1308614400,6,1200,4.577464788732394
3921591,5,B002FA5NNW,"This video/movie is on a subject most people dislike discussing or even admitting that death exists.  It has layers within layers of life and death and treats each gently.  Watching the evolving life of this young man and his family brought forth many emotions of my own family and life.  But in such a sweet, gentle way that it was like remembering the aftertaste of a favorite dessert.  Wow, how can a story about death do that?  By treating death as a normal part of life and honoring the one who has transitioned with such dignity.  Perhaps not everyone is ready to watch this movie and see the same thing that I did, but I do recommend it for anyone who has lost a loved one.  There are some lessons to be learned from this movie.  I am glad it is on DVD so that I can watch it again and again.  Thank you.",1308355200,4,811,4.214285714285714
3921592,5,B002FA5NNW,"`Departures' is a beautiful Japanese film that left me surprised by it's depth and poignancy.  This follows a young cellist, called Daigo Koboyashi, whose Orchestra is disbanded and so he returns with his wife to his home town to earn a living.  He takes a job as an encoffiner (someone who puts the deceased into their coffin) and learns the trade from an experienced older mentor.  He is shunned by some parts of society due to the taboo nature of his job, but he gains the respect of others when they see the level of dignity and honour with which he handles the deceased.  There is more to this film, but I won't spoil your enjoyment by divulging it here.

This film has a wonderful score and the direction is among the best I have seen from a Japanese film of this type.  This film is beautifully framed and it has some amazing scenes showing the ceremony where they prepare the various deceased people.  The story kept me engrossed throughout and despite it's gentle feel, it also has a degree of gravitas and emotion simmering beneath the surface the whole way through.

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did and despite being a fan of Japanese cinema, even I was surprised at how well constructed, acted and directed this was. This is a moving and heart warming drama and if you are a fan of world cinema, or just wish to see an excellent film in it's own right, then this comes highly recommended indeed.

Why do parents walk away without explanation? Is apology, forgiveness possible after death? DVDs Hereafter, Get Low and Departures attempt to address perplexing unanswerables with humor and empathy for the pain we cause for ourselves and others.

Cellist Daigo (Masahiro Motoki) and wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) retreat to his inherited home in Yamagata after his orchestra disbands, and he is forced to sell his world class instrument for financial survival (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Different-Kind-of-Luxury-Japanese-Lessons-in-Simple-Living-and-Inner-Abundance/dp/193333083X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Different Kind of Luxury: Japanese Lessons in Simple Living and Inner Abundance</a>, [ASIN:B0040IDAB4 Your Money Or Your Life: Transforming Your Relationship With Money And Achieving Financial More] Independence). Composer Joe Hisaishi's cello score evokes the mood of the film's emotional arc: failure, survivor guilt, why me? coming of age, meaning of life, self-discovery. Also listen to meditative&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zen-Garden/dp/B00004Y2DV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zen Garden</a>&nbsp;and if you can find it CD Kyotaku recorded on single microphone by Koku Nishimura in his hut in the mountains of Japan 1964.

Mika, Daigo's wife, embodies our attraction to those who shelter our unexplored selves, listen empathically, accept our eccentricities, tactfully guide us past self-deception to our own truth, or complement, in a specific moment, our evolving truth.

Daigo's devotion to his cello is so profound that he skips his mother's funeral because he is performing abroad. Traditional Asian reverence for the elderly and ancestors is supplanted by striving. His mother raised him solo after his father abandoned them when Daigo was 6yo. Daigo's father-mentor pushed and prodded Daigo to play cello which became the family shared meditation, refuge, bond. His father also gifted Daigo with a ""stone letter"" to express the father's mood and intention.

Sasaki (Tsutomu Yamazaki) hires Daigo as a nokanshi encoffiner, adopting the role of mentor father figure. As ""the boss"" Sasaki advises Daigo ""eating affirms life"" (""the living eat the living in order to live""); professional nokanshi interviewed for the film describe being ravenous after performing the ceremony.

Washing of the body ceremonially after death in Japan was traditionally the duty of closest family in preparation for cremation, a time of healing reconciliation for family (compare with Balinese funerals which are healing for entire communities, even if you have not spoken in years, you participate in honoring the family of the one lost, contributing food, money, gifts to the host family).

After WWII Western ideas influenced funereal practice. Japanese began assigning handling a body to strangers considered unclean stigmatized outcasts engaged in a disreputable occupation, nokanshi. Daigo is rejected by his childhood friend, son of the bath house owner, because of his profession as nokanshi.

Daigo, who has not been forthcoming about the nature of his work with his wife, feels unclean after handling bodies and decamps to his neighborhood bathhouse. As a child he was sheltered by the bathhouse owner as he mourned his father's abandonment. Visiting the bathhouse becomes a marital ritual. Daigo has not revealed his occupation to his wife. Both are befriended by the attentive hard working bath house owner, gentle carer who cuts wood, stokes the fire, carries water. Daigo creates a surrogate extended family with ""the boss"" mentor and the warm benevolence of the nurturing bathhouse owner.

The March 11, 2011 earthquake, tsunami and after shocks present Japanese with the challenge of handling bodies with respectful dignity while expelling rubble. Numbers of bodies present with disfigurement, overwhelming the capacity to offer composed honorable farewell, or most disconcerting, not finding the bodies at all.

Writer Kundo Takita encapsulates the diverse responses to death in a melange of families encountered by apprentice nokanshi Daigo as he learns from Sasaki how to encoffin a beloved grandfather, a baseball-loving child, a revered and loved grandmother disfigured by long illness, an adolescent cross-dresser. Daigo's nokanshi rituals restore pain ravaged families to harmony with calm meditative tradition; he finds meaning through gentle ritual and cello meditation.

Okurobito the Japanese film name won multiple awards in Asia and Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2009. Director Yojiro Takita's interview in Special Features: star Masahiro Motoki read the memoir Burakumin by a nokanshi 10years prior. Motoki's desire to translate the book to film was finally realized in 2008.

The humorous evolution of Daigo under the guidance of ""the boss"", the kindly bathhouse owner and her male friend echoes the tender pleasure families feel at watching a child mature.

Departures is enjoyable on multiple levels: reconciliation is role modeled for the child Daigo who has not yet learned apology or forgiveness. Daigo's transformation from guilt, shame, failure, disappointment to gentled self-acceptance under Sasaki's guidance is stately poignant and comedic. In the final act Daigo's use of his profession to heal marriage family friendship and personal wounds is moving and hope filled.

Scott Nearing (1883-1983)

Addendum 2012 I just noticed the biologic father's near invisibility. Daigo's father seems ephemeral: the tragedy of untreated loneliness and depression, a potentially reversible, preventable human suffering. At times I think perhaps loneliness is the only genuine illness. I have seen hospice patients surrounded by loving family, biologic and chosen, preparing for death amidst lovingkindness, while others who are healthy exhibit factitious illness to elicit nurturance instead of actively engaging in mutually satisfying interactions requiring effort, accommodation, flexibility and humility (DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Afternoons-With-Margueritte/dp/B007I1Q59E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Afternoons With Margueritte</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bernie/dp/B00891ZD6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bernie</a>). The father's heavy heart is symbolized by his choice of a large rough dark irregular stone letter, and the father's clinging even after death to his son's optimistic hopeful letter, small, white, smooth and round.

Pride is such a useless handicap, and it turns out that trying to hide your ignorance is one of the best ways of holding onto it.

3921596,5,B002FA5NNW,"This is a pretty brilliant film, managing to tastefully and touchingly walk the line between comedy and genuine emotional depth, all in a context of death and funereal ceremonies.

The main character, Daigo, loses his job as cellist in a Tokyo symphony orchestra when the orchestra goes out of business. He and his wife are forced to move back to Daigo's rural home town, and Daigo falls into a job as a kind of mortician. The film goes into some very beautiful and sometimes comedic scenes about Daigo's job, preparing the corpse for departure -- which really is a service for the benefit of the loved ones who remain.

In the process, much is learned about the nature of death, love and service -- and in general the meaning of life.

There is no violence, no sex, no innuendo - just a heartwarming story about the importance of family, from the perspective of both loving them while you have them, and making sure you have no regrets when they're gone. It's about honesty, dignity, and respect.

Captivating, well-developed performances from all the actors. Not for the viewer who gets bored easily - which in turn is what makes it an excellent film. It takes it's time to tell the story in a non-rushed-yet-not-dragged-out method.

Simply put, this is the most tender movie I've ever seen.  That's all the more impressive when one considers that the overt subject matter is death.  In showing great care for the bodies of those who have passed, we learn about honoring them and the lives they lived.  This leads us directly to the complementary theme of the movie, which is to appreciate life while we have it, savoring our own lives and not taking for granted those who we are meant to love deeply.

This movie is profoundly conceived, exquisitely crafted, and masterfully embodied by its actors.  Needless to say, I highly recommend it, but be prepared to shed tears at the end as all the strands are seamlessly drawn together.",1294963200,5,769,4.576642335766423
3921608,5,B002FA5NNW,"""Departures"" is one of these sublimely inspired masterworks that immediately become part of your aesthetic memory.

Due the fatidic announcement the dissolution of the Orchestra he belonged, a sensitive young cello player must redirection his talent and so the first step is return to his birthplace , where he'll find a new job that could not be more opposite: to prepare the dead for their new stage.

In the second movement of this symphonic picture, he decides to hide the nature of his job to his wife, on the other hand we witness the hate for his father (whom he never saw) and his relationship with his childhood neighbors. Meanwhile his artistic job elicits the secret admiration of his employer.

The third and last movement is one of the most encumbered and heartfelt finales we have seen along the entire history of cinema.

Charming, haunting and arresting film that will capture your soul, where the sense of life, forgiveness and redemption will shake hands.

In sum, one of the three best films of 2008 that deservedly won the coveted award as best Foreign film in that year.",1294790400,2,1091,4.81283422459893

I especially loved the performance of Tsutomu Yamazaki, who subtly plays the boss of the young man who unexpectedly finds himself working as an encoffiner(the art of ""Nokanshi"")when he mistakenly answers a classified ad thinking it is for a tour agent.  As he continues in his new profession of preparing the dead for funerals and entry to the next life, he grows in awareness and has a new weltanschauung as a result.  He doesn't tell his wife until she finds out by accident what he is doing.  Then she is revolted and disgusted.  But she comes round in the end to also see life differently.

The only weakness I could find in the film is that I felt the beginning moved along a little too slowly, while the final scene would have been more effective had it been a bit shorter.

All in all, a decidedly great, profound and extremely moving (sometimes even very comical) cinematic feat which gives one food for thought long after one has viewed it, which is what all great movies do.",1283644800,,1204,4.486238532110092

Most of the 2 hour film was unfamiliar and unexpected. Then came the predictable ending that ruined it for me -- altho some may find it heartwarming.

Moves at the pace of a funeral tune, not surprisingly. An odd sensation accompanied me thru out the film -- I definitely would not want this being done to me! Gloomy photography perhaps enhanced the mood -- but put me off further. Good actors, however.

3921632,4,B002FA5NNW,"I rented ""Departures"" because it won the Oscar recently for Best Foreign-Language Film.  There's always a lot of great competition in that category.  I found ""Departures"" to be very engrossing although there were a couple of moments that I was a bit uncertain about where we were going next.  The essential plot is that of a gifted (but not THAT gifted) cellist who loses his job (along with the rest of the orchestra).  He returns to his relatively small home town and finds a job.  It's an unusual job and understanding the job takes up a fair amount of the film.  Some people belittle or otherwise criticize the job.  (I know my wife probably would have given me a choice of her or the job).

The cast of characters begins to come together in a most unique manner and reaches a conclusion that achieves an emotional peak.  I was emotionally spent as a result of the last few minutes of the film.  As I was watching the ending unfold, I remembered that it was Father's Day.  In fact, my two daughters had each called during the movie at which times I gratefully put the DVD on pause until our conversations were completed.  I realized that I had been given one of the greatest cinematic glimpses of a father's love (no matter how incomplete the example may have been) that I have experienced on film.  (Our own family movies aside, of course).

The film, overall, has its' ups and downs and I was disappointed that the director felt he (or she?) had to repeat an earlier scene to make sure we got the message.  I recalled the earlier scene quite clearly when the time came to put it all together and I felt that repeating it was an example of a director not respecting his (or her?) audience.  Nonetheless, love takes many forms in expressing itself and ""Departures"" contribution to this kaleidoscope was brilliant and unforgettable.

And most people who hear what this movie is about probably won't want to see it.

But those who do will appreciate that this is one of the most economical yet profoundly moving meditations on life and death ever committed to celluloid.

This is a film that had me in tears for the last hour and in tears again this morning, the day after viewing.  Not tears of sorrow or bitterness, but tears of empathy for -- and appreciation of -- the human condition.

Beautifully acted, directed, written, and photographed, ""Departures"" hits a home run on every level.

I could go into more detail about the story, but this is a case where the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.  Let me just say that the film touches on life, death, love, and parenthood -- and penetrates to the core of each theme with a minimum of words and histrionics.

I definitely recommend purchasing a copy of this film, as you will want to see it again and again with family and friends.

3921636,5,B002FA5NNW,"Departures, the 2009 Best Foreign Film is a Japanese film with grace, beauty, tradition, music and humor. The film won numerous other awards.

Nokanshi (encoffineer) is the process of preparing bodies for their final departure.  A process is done poetically, spiritually and gracefully, all in view of the grieving family.  On top of that, the 2 hour film's classical score is beautiful and it coincides with the lush and sweeping landscapes.  It is about life and death, whether it is nurturing plantlife in the office, life inside a womb, to friendship in life, grieving for the departed or the beauty of life's next step, death.

Mashairo Motoki stars as Daigo Kobayashi who lost his job as a celloist/cellist  with the orchestra and unwittingly lands a job to prepare the bodies.  Completely surprised, sickened, inexperienced, he puts his best forward, while his wife seems the job is dirty and leaves him.  He is ridiculed for taking on such a job.

He begins to feel good about his job, has confidence, and is totally immersed in it.  There is humor but with dignity.  Daigo sees the different grieving emotions while he prepares the bodies.  And, we learn about his relationship with his father, the bitterness, who left when he was young.  And the ending is simply a life changing moment.  The film focuses on friendship, work, life, death, humanity and the journey for the departed.

This is a film that the family can enjoy, feel and learn from.

Indeed, death is part of life, and I would wish I'd be put to rest in as dignified a procedural as depicted here.

3921641,5,B002FA5NNW,"What you probably know: this is a film about a Japanese cellist whose orchestra is dissolved.  He misreads a job ad and finds himself applying for a position as an assistant to a man who prepares bodies for their coffins (and, then, their cremation).  The process is beautifully ritualistic, a very professional act of loving care.  His wife is embarrassed by her husband's job and returns to her parents' home (waiting for her husband to find a new job).  What happens, of course, is that the cellist discovers both the art and the humaneness of his new position and pursues it with the passion and skill that he brought to his cello playing.  In the process he even has the opportunity to reconnect with the father who abandoned him.  The film is sweet, heartfelt, amusing in a host of ways and very, very moving.

What you probably don't know: the script is perfect, the acting pitch-perfect, the direction simply amazing.  Film schools often teach direction using the grand-scale example of David Lean.  Lean is a magnificent director, but for those making a smaller, more personal film with a limited budget this work of Takita's could serve as a new exemplar.

This is the kind of film Hollywood seldom makes and more's the pity.  It assumes that there are common elements in human nature; it addresses universal human emotions and it manages to be deadly serious in a lighthearted, touching, totally-apolitical way.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the filmmaker's craft at its highest level of skill.

3921643,5,B002FA5NNW,"NOT because it's of Japanese origin---admittedly, I'm biased---but I can't recommend too highly Departures (Okuribito), the Academy Award-winning foreign language film of a couple of years ago. The star, Masahiro Motoki (ex-teen idol-turned-actor), comes from the world of Japanese boy bands---Johnny's Boys ---and the director, Yojiro Takita, is out of Japanese soft porn ""adult"" films (think Radley Metzger). Talk about changing horses in mid-stream!

Departure's arc from conception to realization took fifteen years, according to director Takita in an interview that comes with the DVD of the film. And, he informs, it was totally a group effort, i.e., improv, commitment, story contributions (the germ of the idea for film was Mokoki's), etc. I was amused by it, and, alternately, shed a tear or three as well.

3921649,4,B002FA5NNW,"Without irony, there is a funereal grace to this 2009 dramedy, so much so that one can sometimes hear the distinct echoes of film master Yasujiro Ozu (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>) in director Yojiro Takita's subtle yet stately look at the business of preparing deceased bodies for their caskets. Ozu's influence can be felt most in the quietude of tone that reveals the inevitability of death with both grim humor and spiritual awakening. The film's lyricism rests on the mournful cello accompaniment of the protagonist, Daigo Kobayashi, a young cellist who finds himself jobless after his Tokyo-based orchestra is disbanded. Out of economic necessity, he and his sunny, supportive wife Mika move back to his late mother's house up north in Yamagata.

As outlined in Kundo Koyama's somewhat methodical screenplay, the story focuses on the challenge Daigo faces in finding one's place in life, no matter how dubious it may seem to others. Daigo, bereft of his passion, answers a job ad involving ""departures"", which leads him to believe the company is a travel agency. However, he quickly realizes the two-person operation is actually about preparing bodies for burial, ritually cleansing and cloaking them while the mourners watch. Initially aghast, he is convinced by the taciturn owner Mr. Sasaki that he is ideal for the role of assistant and offers him the job. He has to fight his own prejudices as well as others about the supposed unseemliness of his profession, including Mika, who finds out her husband's new profession and pronounces him unclean. Daigo, however, realizes he has found his passion in the pre-burial ceremony, and Sasaki teaches him the ropes in a way that recalls how he taught Nobuko Miyamoto how to open a successful ramen shop in Juzo Itami's beloved comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tampopo/dp/B000GG4RMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tampopo</a>&nbsp;a quarter century earlier.

Former boy-band singer Masahiro Motoki is genuinely affecting as Daigo, while Ryoko Hirosue brings a surprising layer of complexity to the perennially sunny Mika. The deadpan Tsutomu Yamazaki makes Sasaki the film's key gravitational element with a minimum of effort, while Kimiko Yo shows an offbeat quality as his office manager Yuriko. The cinematography by Takeshi Hamada is top-notch with some memorable images offered along the way (like Daigo playing his cello on a hilltop), and Joe Hisaishi's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kikujiro/dp/B00004Z1FE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kikujiro</a>) music score allows dramatic sweep without getting too epic. On the downside, the film runs too long at 130 minutes, and there are moments when the comedy is played too broadly and the sentiment laid on too thick. Still, the movie shows Japanese cinema still exudes a unique identity, and there is global vitality still in that country's film industry.

Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a talented musician, but when his orchestra is abruptly disbanded, he suddenly finds himself without a source of steady income. Making the decision to move back to his small hometown, Daigo answers a classified ad for a company called ""Departures,"" mistakenly assuming that he will be working for a travel agency.

3921654,5,B002FA5NNW,"DEPARTURES (aka OKURIBITO) is an experience film, one of those graceful creations of cinema that finds the balance between comedy and drama, sensitive and sentimental, and is embellished by a wondrous musical score and glowing cinematography.  Running time is in excess of two hours, but likely most viewers would elect to rewind and watch it again, so touching and vital is this story.

Daigo Kobayashi (the enormously gifted Masahiro Motoki) was raised by his mother when his father for some reason left his family when Daigo was only six years old: his last memory of his father is a quiet scene by the ocean when the child and the father exchange found rocks.  Daigo was encouraged by his parents to learn to play the cello so that he could amount to something special as a man.  Things happen: Daigo goes off to study cello, his mother dies and he doesn't attend the funeral, he marries Mike (Ryoko Hirosue), and spends all their money on a prime cello to gain admission to the major orchestra in the city.  The orchestra plays to near empty houses and is finally disbanded.  Daigo is without an income, sells his prize cello, and with Mika's blessing, returns to his hometown to live in the home of his childhood. He answers an ad for work, an ad that uses the word 'Departures' making Daigo think this is a travel agency. When Daigo 'interviews' with the owner (Tsutomu Yamazaki) he discovers that the job in one called 'encoffinment' (a Japanese ceremonial procedure of preparing, dressing & praying for the corpse before putting them in the coffin). At first repulsed by the job, Daigo gradually discovers the importance of paying final respects to the dead and preparing them for the life ahead, and his experiences with the new found beauty of encoffinment ties in with memories of his family, recalls his estrangement from his father, and reunites him with old dear friends who run a bath house, etc.  Mika is spared the truth about her husband's new job, and when she discovers the truth, Mika leaves Daigo who by now is enchanted with his position.

Many experiences follow as Daigo encoffins all manner of people: there are some ugly scenes and some very humorous scenes depicting the variety of 'calls' Daigo gets.  How the story winds down is not necessarily difficult to discern, but the manner in which the film ends is a work of great simplicity and beauty.  Daigo's dealing with departures allows him to find his own arrivals.

Writer Kundo Takita and director Yjir Takita well deserve all the awards lavished on this perfect little film.  But much of the success of this story about another way to view death is the astonishingly multifaceted performance by Masahiro Motoki, a beautiful man and an equally beautiful actor.  This is a film to watch repeatedly and definitely one to add to the personal library of DVDs.  Grady Harp, February 10",1267315200,2,2864,4.794715447154472

The four main characters are all rather memorable. Daigo is played by young actor with considerable poise and feeling. Mika, Daigo's wife, is played by quite an experienced young actress. Mika is almost childlike creation, she was so sweet and trusting.

3921662,5,B002FA5NNW,"Daigo Kobayashi needs to grow up fast. When his dream career of being a professional cellist falls through, he has some difficult decisions to make. Although he is already in his mid-30s, he still behaves irresponsibly by hiding the cost of his prized cello from his wife, Mika. She puts up with his immaturity and even agrees to leave Tokyo for the Yamagata countryside to save costs as he looks for a new job, and he sells his cello to pay off his debt.

Once back in his home town, Daigo continues to act childishly. He finds a job that pays well, but he hides its true nature from Mika because he knows she won't like it. Things seem to be going well, and he takes solace from playing his childhood cello as he learns to be a nohkanshi (encoffiner). Eventually Mika discovers his deception and gives him an ultimatum-- give up his dirty, embarrassing job or she's leaving. He finally feels like he has found a job he can do well, and he lets her go. Even his old friend snubs him and tells him to get a ""decent job"". Coming back to his home town also brings back memories of the father he has hated his whole life for abandoning him when he was 6.

By persevering in the difficult, socially unacceptable work, Daigo grows up by learning responsibility and empathy. When his boss (who is the closest thing to a father figure he has ever had) explains it, his job makes sense. Mika comes back when she learns she is pregnant, and his determination wins her over to see that he can be a solid husband and father. I won't spoil the ending.

Director Yohjiroh Takita presents us with a rich film that is a study of calm minimalism. Rather than trying to keep the audience's interest by packing the movie with loud dialog, action, cheap laughs, special effects and intense sounds, he pulls us in with a moving soundtrack, likable characters, good acting, subtle humor, beautiful scenery, and a gripping story. An example of doing a lot with a little is seen in the ending of the film in the exchange between Daigo and Mika. All he needs is eye contact and gestures to pull it off. Jo Hisaishi's score carries the film in a good way, as did Basil Poledouris' carry ""Lonesome Dove"".

I watched it 3 times in one week, and I was in tears every time. The first time I watched it I found myself critiquing the subtitles more than enjoying the film, so I viewed it again with subtitles off. After digesting the story for a few days I gave it one last look. The boss' (Sasaki's) quip, ""Ikimono wa ikimono wo kutte ikiterun da"" (literally ""Living things eat living things to live"") didn't seem well served by being translated ""The living eat the dead."" That being said, I know it's a lot easier to criticise a completed translation than to actually come up with one oneself.

While ""Departures"" is by no means the blockbuster film that the recent Bollywood film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was, I assure you that if you are up to learning about Japanese Culture and their profound respect for the dead, and for life as well, this movie will move you as few ever will.  Departures tells the story of a young man whose life takes an unexpected turn as he is abruptly severed from his dream life as a concert orchestra musician when the orchestra goes bankrupt.  With the support of his wife, he returns to his home town and by chance, becomes the apprentice of a ""nokanshi"" or coffiner, a person who dresses the recently deceased, and helps them transition into the afterlife.

Instead this film is laced with humor, pathos, and leaves the viewer richer and grateful for life, its value.  If you watch this film, I believe that you'll have a much greater appreciation enriching aspects of forgiveness, gratitude and humility as discovered in the human experience.

Third, the story itself was so incredibly touching that I was astounded.  At various times I laughed, then I cried so hard!

  This is the story of a young man who dreams of playing the cello in an orchestra, but when he loses his job, he and his wife go back to where he grew up (he was left a building and their expenses will be less).  There he looks for a job.  There is a misprint in the paper, and he thinks he is interviewing for some sort of travel agent (departures), but it is, instead, working with the ""departed.""

  I recommend this film to anyone who 1) loves film in general, and 2) loves films that touch those parts of the soul that we rarely want to look at -- those that harbor grief, regret, nostalgia.  How memorable are the performances?  I'll never forget them!  I noticed, too, that the gentleman who runs the ""departures"" business is the same actor who was in Tampopo!

You probably know already that this is the story of a ""downsized"" cello player who finds a job as an encofineer ( the men who add the makeup and garments to deceased persons before the are cremated.) I hope you don't know more, as it will really destroy the surprises in store for you as this beautiful film unfolds. I won't even give it a long review for that reason. The music all revolves around the cello and the score (which features 13 cells playing together over the end titles) is reminiscent of what Michael Nyman composed for the film ""The Piano"". The cinematography is gorgeous. There is no blood and no violence. Death comes naturally here and there is beauty in the dressing.

The subtitles are in yellow below the image and easy to read. And the dialogue is never fast, so you don't need to rush to read them. The DVD contains an interesting 11-minute interview with the Director (which is translated verbally into English as well as in English subtitles.). Don't watch the interview until after you see the film. It will spoil some of enjoyment.

This is a film that is appropriate for older teens and may actually lead to some interesting discussions of the humanity of death. But don't let that dissuade you from seeing it. Its just a BEAUTIFUL loving musically rich film.

3921675,5,B002FA5NNW,"Japanese films have always had the remarkable reputation of turning the simplest premise into something so full of moving emotions and sensibilities. Yojiro Takita's multi-award winning film ""DEPARTURES"" (2008) is no different. There is a lot of excessive hype surrounding the film as it has almost nearly swept the Japanese Academy awards and has been awarded the Best Foreign film honor in the recent 2009 Oscars. No film can live up to the hype it has gotten, but I have to say it has earned each and every recognition; well deserving of the commercial success it had achieved in its native land.

Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player whose dream is shattered when the orchestra he is playing with goes broke. Left with no choice but to sell his prized cello, Daigo together with his wife Mika (beauteous Ryoko Hirosue) returns to his hometown to live in his mother's old house.  In need of a new job, Daigo responds to an ad in the local paper for a job in ""Departures"", thinking that it may be related to travel. But much to his surprise and dismay, Daigo discovers that he had applied for a profession as an `Encofineer'; a man who performs the delicate and traditional Japanese ritual of preparing the bodies of the deceased for the departure to the next life--it pays quite well, and without even thinking about it, he accepts without even giving his wife the details of his new job.

It is not often that we become privy to a film about the beautifying of corpses, director Takita takes on the grim subject matter and gives it a commercial charm and appeal. The direction is quite meticulous in exposing the world of the mortician as we become witnesses to the Japanese customs and traditions as to how they deal with their dead. Takita shows that the profession demands a certain amount of sensitivity as we see the different reactions of those left behind by the deceased; some are angry, some are funny, most are overwhelmed by grief and some are curiously joyful. In Daigo's profession, there are no religious affiliation; they do what they do to preserve the memory of the deceased, remembering them as the way they used to be and not who they are in the present.

It is a safe bet that a premise such as this may be unusual even for Japanese audiences and one of the film's key to success is the way it executes its grim subject matter through some doses of subtle humor in the film's first act. Writer Kundo Koyama and the direction by Takita meticulously eases the premise into the audience, as we were privy to Daigo and Sasaki's encounter with an extra ""thing"" to a supposedly female corpse. We see Masahiro Motoki's deadpan humor as he becomes repulsed by his first job, and just how he eventually becomes comfortable with his new career. Takita cleverly illustrates the short moments in the ceremony that our morticians get to know the deceased quite intimately.

After everything sinks in, then the emotional scenes begin to take hold, as we learn more of Daigo's childhood, his problems with his wife's disapproval of his new job and his anger towards his father who had left him while he was a child to run off with a younger woman. Now this is a commercial film and we know that eventually people close to Daigo will eventually come to respect what he does for a living, it is a little predictable but the journey with which the film gets to where it wishes to go is well-played that the screenplay becomes somewhat of a melancholy with a rhythm that just looks so beautiful. Mika (played by Ryoko Hirosue) is just so lovable as the diligent wife; she is just so full of love and trust that her character represents the goodness within the Japanese woman. It was touching to see Daigo perform a ceremony in his wife's presence and director Takita carefully manipulates the camera work to show pure emotion. Takita also injects some sequences that are beautiful to awaken the emotion (sort of serves as a vanguard) as we see Daigo playing the cello on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams. The film also has beautiful cinematography and emotion-inducing score to match its otherwise simple but grim premise to keep the film running at a brisk pace.

The film has two significant scenes that seemed to induce quite a few sniffles, they were injected to give a twist that plays a significant part in Daigo's life. The first one does provoke a lot of emotion; it is full of tear-inducing sequences that can definitely touch its audience. However, it does feel a little overlong that the second twist may lose some of the narrative impact to the inexperienced viewer. The two twists do work in unison in the screenplay but some may argue that Takita was working too hard to induce emotion working one twist right after the other. I didn't find anything wrong with it and I thought it stuck to its sensibilities in reflecting just how life can sometimes throw you in for a curve.

The performances are quite good, Motoki (who won best actor in Japan) and Hirosue has some dynamic chemistry between them and the supporting characters made up of Sasaki, Yuriko (co-employee played by Kimiko Yo) and the woman (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) who runs a bath house plays their own significance in the script. I loved the way Yamazaki played Sasaki, it was like a cool and quiet boss as he always seemed to say ""its fine.""

Despite some flaws in the screenplay that the film came dangerously close in becoming too sentimental, ""Departures"" is easily one of the best commercial films to come out from Japan. The last act will leave an impression that no matter how we see ourselves and others, death sometimes is the one thing that can bring a family together. The film's biggest ace would have to come from its ability to induce the proper emotion at the right minute with such simplicity. Such critical acclaim will no doubt raise the film to unreasonable expectations, and while it may not change the course of Japanese cinema, it is not pretentious and never hides behind its beautiful visual style. The way to approach this film is with tempered expectations, so that the film can touch you in its journey that is both surprising and pleasurable.

Highly Recommended! [4  + Stars]

This is a movie that you will not want to forget. It is so well put together in all respects that you will want to view it again immediately. The overall charm and humour of the film makes for a touching if at times sad experience. A credit to the modern movie industry. Wonderful, fascinating and honest I found ""Departures"" truly appealing.",1258416000,,570,6.916666666666667

3921678,5,B002FA5NNW,"This Japanese film definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.  It's the type of movie that can appeal to almost everyone.  Even though it's about death, it's not really depressing because it's funny and poignant.  And observant of the human condition.  In some ways, DEPARTURES reminded me of HANNAH AND HER SISTERS.  Both movies had characters who put death on the back burner until one day when they had to confront it.  The Woody Allen character in HANNAH confronted death because he thought he had cancer.  The main character in DEPARTURES confronted death because he needed a job.  And although he wasn't too keen on working for a funeral parlor, he learned the value of a mortician by how well they took care of the dead.  And eventually his wife learned the same thing too.  If anything I hope DEPARTURES removes the taboo that is associated with death, morticians and funeral parlors.  It will show how it is an essential part of society.  This is why I felt DEPARTURES is one of the best films of 2009.",1257811200,2,1021,4.674157303370786
3921679,5,B002FA5NNW,"Winner of the 2009 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Picture.  My favorite movie of 2008-09 movie year.  A celloist with a Symphony get's laid off, a sign of the times, and heads back with his wife to his late mother's home in a rural part of Japan.  Our protagonist, looks for a new job, sees a advertisement for a firm called ""Depatures.""  Thinking the firm is a travel agency, he soon has a big shock.  He does not tell his wife what he does at Departures.  This film still shows movies still work without CGI, Big Stars, Music Video Editing, and loud music.  You need a great script, great actors and thoughtful director.  Slow...but deep, moving and touching story.  A film about the importance of detail, hearing and rememberance!  Three Cheers for the Departures!",1257638400,3,776,4.681481481481481
3921680,5,B002FA5NNW,"Went to see Departures tonight. Wow only 8 patrons watching this great, no super great film. The Japanese have much greater reverence for the newly and dearly departed than in the USA. Just a spectacular film of the heart on all levels. This one has a profoundly moving ending and am going to buy this on on DVD immediately. Dont miss it but be prepared to shed the tears if you have a heart that is.",1255132800,,400,4.276315789473684
3921681,5,B002FA5NNW,This was a great film to watch.  It teaches about life and death in no way possible.  The film even carries a bit of light comedy to balance the drama.  In addition the score was absolutely rich and intoxicating.  The special features were fun to watch and informed.  Must own!,1254528000,,277,4.46

8368892,5,B002FA5NNW,"This movie provides a thoughtful analysis of the things that are truly worthy of respect and honor, and the things that we culturally decide are shameful and embarrassing that absolutely shouldnt be.  This was beautifully and subtly acted and I was completely captivated by the sheer quiet eloquence and beauty of it.  It is in my top 5 favorite movies Ive seen in my lifetime (Im early 50s).  Unforgettable.  I saw it free on Prime a year to two ago.  I eventually decided I couldn't live without it and had to purchase it to watch again and again.",1516579200,4,549,4.561224489795919

8368894,5,B002FA5NNW,"Sincerely one of the BEST movies I've ever seen! To those of you who don't like subtitled movies, I say, don't let that stand in your way of this movie. It is a movie with humor, poignancy, pathos, and an uplifting message of life! The story is about a musician who decides to start over when the orchestra he plays in disbands. I don't want to say much more, just watch this movie - you'll never forget it and it's message of family, love, and life!",1515110400,2,450,4.244186046511628
