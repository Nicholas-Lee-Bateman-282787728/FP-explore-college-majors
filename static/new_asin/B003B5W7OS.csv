8393489,5,B003B5W7OS,"In ""Say Cheese"" Alton Brown takes the purveyance of cheesy comestibles to a whole new level. His preparations are perfect (although one in particular, cheese souffl, is notoriously difficult to execute,) and all of them look delicious. I particularly liked ""For Whom The Cheese Melts"" and found it to be an eminently practical episode as well (try the Fondue Vudu), while ""Egg Files 5 - Cheese Souffl"" is the most interesting from a preparation standpoint but also the one I'd be least likely to try myself (even the enclosed mini recipe book lists its ease of preparation as expert, and I am no expert at dealing with eggs.) Although I am not an onion soup lover, ""A Bowl of Onion"" was still interesting for its educational and preparation techniques. Of course as with all episodes of ""Good Eats"" there are bits of science and history liberally tossed into the mix, making each episode worth watching.

""Say Cheese"" is a great DVD from Alton Brown, and I highly recommend it.",1432684800,,977,4.781065088757397

8393491,5,B003B5W7OS,These take out collections with Alton brown are great. the ask Alton after each segment pertaining to that perticular episode is very good. Don't think that was on the original seasons. Trying to keep adding to my collection,1371081600,,224,4.921052631578948
8393492,5,B003B5W7OS,"This may seem like a strange recipe to mention under a ""cheese"" collection, but I don't eat meat and I really missed French Onion Soup.  AB's how-to gave me the basic idea of how the recipe worked and I was able to substitute vegetarian 'chicken' stock for the meat... and my omnivore friends love it because, as Alton says -- the cheese really makes the soup.  And made meat-free, it is FAR less greasy.

All the rest of the cheese recipes here are wonderful, too -- I've never seen a cooking show that was such a great blend of science, wit, and .. well .. good eats",1370390400,,568,4.289719626168225
