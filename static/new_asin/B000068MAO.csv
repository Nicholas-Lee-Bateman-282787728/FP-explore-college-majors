7964319,5,B000068MAO,"The fourth and final volume of this ultra-stylish action saga brings home the goods and then some.  We get some freakish twists and turns, we get balls to the wall action, and we get an upbeat but not overly sappy ending.  All the way through, an entertaining blend of sci-fi, sorcery, and human drama.  This collection will hold a respected place right next to my copies of Outlaw Star, Evangelion, and Cowboy Bebop.  Are you a man, or the devil?",1029369600,,447,4.55
