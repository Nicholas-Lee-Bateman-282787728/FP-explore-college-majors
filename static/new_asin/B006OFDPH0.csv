8501903,5,B006OFDPH0,"I had seen this short silent film many years ago when there were no subtitles.  Written by a great Sardinian author, Grazia Deledda and from her book of the same title, Ashes.  Duse was an extraordinarily beautiful woman and maintained her looks into her old age.  She plays the mother that a man spends his whole life searching for. What can one say?  Bernard Shaw thought her a greater actress than Bernhardt.  She uses her whole body and seems so very modern, never seeming to be aware of the camera.  Magnificent hands and never overdone.  She had been the lover of Gabriele D'Annunzio, who used her terribly and whom she supported.  Ettore Boito had also been her lover and he was honorable.  He went on to wirte a great opera, ""Mefestofele"" and an incomplete ""Nerone""  Still he is best known as the librettist of Verdi's last Shakesperean masterpieces, ""Otello"" and ""Falstaff"" as well several scenes from the great ""Simon Bocanegra"", a tryout Verdi asked for before committing to the later works.  Duse died in the Midwest where she was performing and was caught in a rainstorm, from which she developed pneumonia.  The more you know of these incredible people the more you can enjoy the greats of the human race and ignore the unworthy monsters of the species.",1458172800,,1267,4.761467889908257

of her on film.",1435449600,,163,3.7941176470588234
8501905,5,B006OFDPH0,"I had no idea that there was motion picture evidence of the acting of Eleonora Duse.  Here she is in the blood.  And the acting is not the stock gestures and overacting that we are used to from silent pictures, but something much closer to what we are used to seeing as acting.  She is a revelation.  Giving this stars is of little use, as the plot is this, but the acting is a revelation.",1413849600,,389,4.1466666666666665
