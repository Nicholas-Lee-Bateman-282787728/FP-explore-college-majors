6015812,3,B00FNRA3CA,"The ""editorial review on amazon states""
A junk dealer builds his own spaceship in order to salvage space junk.

So... I assumed (along with the misleading picture on the dvd case) that this was the pilot episode and it was called ""golden orbit"".  made sense to me.  Anyway...when I received the disk, I realize that this is NOT the pilot episode where the ship was made, but in fact just a regular episode in the short-lived series.  Should have looked it up in the movie database - would have realized this and not wasted my money.",1401753600,21,532,4.510416666666667

6015817,4,B00FNRA3CA,"I had forgotten all about this series.  Too bad it was pulled so quick and forgotten.
Have not seen it?  Picture a mash-up between Thunderbirds, The Andy Griffin Show and the A Team (without guns).

WAY too expensive at $20 for a single episode but if they had the series for the same price....",1387843200,8,294,4.407407407407407
