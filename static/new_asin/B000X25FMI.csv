8226659,3,B000X25FMI,"Somehow kind of boring, specially when this Valdez (male actor) comes into scene. He is SO BORING. He thinks he is FUNNY. HE IS NOT!!
HE IS JUST STUPID making all the idiotic mimics and trying to sing in 45 RPM (but in a high speed!)...
I will just give three stars. And I do it because of the girls who play good in it.
Go home Valdez!",1377993600,,336,3.9558823529411766
