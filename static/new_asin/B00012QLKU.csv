8005708,1,B00012QLKU,"When I read the manga, before I got the anime, I thought ""hmm...corporate but pretty, maybe they are preparing for a killer anime"".  Unfortunately not.  The art in the anime is still very nice, but the plot and character development, which was very promising in the manga, seems to have been dropped on the cutting room floor.

Watch this in Japanese, without subtitles.  You'll be better for it.  Unless you understand spoken Japanese.  Then there's always the mute button.

Better yet, buy the manga.  It is very pretty.",1125705600,,522,4.8522727272727275
8005709,5,B00012QLKU,"Without giving much away, imagine the American film Starship Troopers, but this time with younger (16) soldiers.  Then set it in Japan, adding in a previous alien invasion/war in 1945.  Add mechs.  Stir well.  There you have it.

Very well executed, if you forgive the borrowing from Heinlein, as I do.  The only thing that suffers is the fact that this is ""just"" an intro/setup for the whole story.

The best part is characterization.  These young soldiers act realistically and don't come off as either stereotypical whiny teens or hard-boiled, emotionless vets.

If you want to see a really good translation of mediocre American film based on classic SF, this is the one to get.

Now, if there was a way to do Stranger in a Strange Land...",1100995200,,742,4.7265625
8005710,4,B00012QLKU,"""Gunparade March"", if you do some research on the title, was based on a Playstation game by SCE (Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.) that came out in 2000. If you dig a bit further, you should find the series's review and how, because of the attrition from fighting the ""Genjuu"" beasts, teenaged students are now being called up to fight in HWTs (just think of these as the generic mobile suits in the Gundam universes) with Atsushi Hayami supposed to be a trump card in the war.
When I first read that review of the series, the first thing that came to mind was ""Not another giant robot series with the main character, a teenager, discovering that he has some mysterious power or ability that lets him defeat his enemies!""
Very happily, ""Gunparade March"" failed to live up to that expectation.
Don't get me wrong, though; there is combat in the series - and they are done well - but those scenes are not in every episode. The series is more about people living their lives as best they could when monsters can appear out of nowhere and attack them as well as the high school students who, when the raid siren goes off, have to jump into their HWTs, go into combat, and oftentimes, die in the process. In other words, it's a series that has a great deal of interpersonal relationships involved.
A minor spoiler; a favorite and very sad scene of mine has a TV news anchor read the names and ages of those young kids who died in the day's fighting, and people passing along simply walk along as if they didn't even hear. Great emotional impact, I thought, with dusk and the rain falling, and the voice reading what seemed to be a never-ending list of names.
All in all, this is a great series that I highly recommend. I'm only giving four (actually 4 1/2 :-) stars to this disc as it, according to Media Blasters's website, carries the first four episodes, which provides the introduction to the storyline and characters. You don't really see why someone like Shibamura Mai (one of the main characters) would volunteer to join the armed forces as a pilot - at least, not yet.",1079308800,12,2072,4.528
