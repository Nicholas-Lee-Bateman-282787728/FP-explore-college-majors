6735523,5,B00OCUYC0I,"All three of my kids love to watch Jake and the Neverland Pirates. They saw Battle for the Book on TV and asked me to find it for them to watch again. Luckily it is now out on DVD so we can enjoy anytime.

My kids love all Jake shows but I think they are particularly enthralled by the ones where the original Peter Pan is referenced today or one of the original character's shows up like in Battle for the Book. When Captain Hook steals Wendy's book, Jake and friends have to help get it back before all stories of Neverland are forgotten.

I have to admit I find a little bit of magic in these episodes as well since Peter Pan is the stuff my childhood is made of! It's fun to see how they tie the original in to Jake and his friends.

To ad a little fun, this DVD comes with a checkerboard bandanna and gold ""coins"" they can play checkers with on it. My kids had tons of fun with this!

If your kids are Jake fans like mine, they will love Battle for the Book and the other included episodes as well as the fun goodies that come with this one! Make sure to check out the fun activities for them below as well!",1421366400,,1112,4.040909090909091
6735524,5,B00OCUYC0I,"It is a magical journey of teamwork and determination.  A never-give-up story that features the classic characters of Peter Pan such as Wendy and her brothers as well as Tinker Bell!  I think it is a wonderful kids movie full of adventure and music.  I even found myself toe tapping to some of the songs.

The voice of Wendy is a little hard to get used to at first, just because I am used to the classic film, but the kids didn't seem to care.  Most of the excitement was directed at Jake and his crew as they flew to the second star to the right, traveled through London, chased Hook, avoided fire and assisted Wendy in getting her book back before memories were lost forever

I certainly recommend this for all the kids that love Disney Junior and maybe those who are young at heart and want to see Peter Pan and Tinker Bell work together again :D.",1420502400,4,851,4.320754716981132

So Wendy notifies Peter and soon Peter summons Jake, Izzy, Cubby, and Skully the parrot help out Wendy, John and Michael and travel back to Never land to retrieve the book before all of Never Land will be disappeared, forever. This DVD also features four Never Land Pirates episodes, including The Never Land Pirates helping Captian Flynn search for the treasure of the Pirate Mummy's tomb, Pip, the Pirate Genie(voiced by David Arquette)tells three Never Land-style stories of great Middle-Eastern pirates Sinbad and Ali Baba, Captian Gizmo, a Pirate Robot that was assembled by Cubby, and Capt.

6735557,4,B00OCUYC0I,"I feel like the episodes on this DVD aren't as good as the other previously released Jake titles. There are a few repeated Neverland Pirate Band performances at the end of the episodes and only a couple new ones. There are new characters, but they are not introduced in any of the episodes. Just thrown in with no back story. As someone without cable and limited data for online streaming, I'd like to know more about these new characters and wish their original episodes would have been included. The series even seems to have rebooted the intro theme song. I liked the original. As an adult, maybe these are silly things to complain about, but it's my honest opinion. As long as I have to watch Jake with my daughter, I think my opinion is fair to share. Lol!",1424476800,2,761,4.482014388489208
