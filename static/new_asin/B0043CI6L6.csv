4255110,5,B0043CI6L6,"This formidable movie based on Naomi Klein's mightily important book, explains how the financial `elite' uses shocks (crises) for implementing its `free market' gospel, or, better, to increase its economic power and concomitantly its own financial interests.

Economics (general shocks)
In his mightily important book `The Secrets of the Federal Reserve', E. Mullins reveals how the financial `elite' manipulated market prices and provoked the Wall Street Crash of 1929. What they didn't foresee was the gigantic economic slump and the massive unemployment that would follow the crash. The US government had to intervene in the economy with a `New Deal': breaking up the banking system and impose regulations and governmental interventions in the economy. The `New Deal' weakened significantly the grip of the financial oligarchy on the US economy.
The `free market' gospel propagated by the Chicago School of Economics (Milton Friedman) is nothing less than a frontal attack on the legislation provided by the New Deal. The gospel defends deregulation and privatization of the economy instead of regulation and governmental intervention (through its institutions and enterprises). The gospel tries to prove and to justify that free market policies (the old order) are far better than those imposed by a government.
The implementation of a deregulated and privatized (by selling off government possessions) economy was first tested in Chile and Argentina after military coups (shocks). It didn't work. The deregulation of the US financial system ended in a worldwide financial collapse of the banking system, which had to be bailed out by governmental intervention (the people's money) at a staggering cost of thousand of billions of dollars worldwide, a mind-boggling anti-shock treatment.

Psychiatrics, psychology (personal shocks)
The movie starts with the experiments of Ewen Cameron on psychiatric patients in Canada. He tried to control (break) the minds and to reprogram (clear) the psyche of his patients with electroshocks and drugs. His methods are now used on political prisoners (`terrorists').
By creating shocks (heavy bombardments, grotesque lies, false flag operations) and also after `natural' shocks (floods) the `elite' tries to instill fear into the population in order to control their will, to implement their policies and, in fine, to prevent or to obstruct the establishment or the functioning of a real democracy.

Reactions
Reactions against `elite' shock doctrine policies must come from `below', from the people, whose money was squandered in order to bail out the reckless speculations of `too big to fail' mentalities.
The solution will not come from those who want to `fight' climate change by commodifying the atmosphere (trading carbon dioxide emissions).

This movie and its extras are a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.",1375315200,,2890,5.487640449438202
4255111,2,B0043CI6L6,"This is a visual mess.  Like so many attempts at visually explaining an abstract idea  the makers have to rely on what footage is available and their budget.  This is just seventy-eight minutes of newsreel riots and wars letting up occasionally to show some talking-head politicos captured at a news conference.  I often wonder when watching this sort of material just how technically poor a bit of film can be before film-makers say 'We can't use this' but it it seems that quick editing and added sound effects can redeem anything.

Fortunately the background narration and Naomi Klein's appearance on the lecture circuit pull so much of her book into perspective.  The big disappointment for me was not confronting these 'crony capitalism' guys for an explanation on why there was so much failure with their policies around the world.

4255117,3,B0043CI6L6,"I think it's almost a conspiracy theory, which is always fun and interesting, but I would not regard it as more than that or a possible ""alternative history"", as she says in the movie.

Especially Milton Friedman is depicted in, what I believe, a terribly dishonest way, because he was always against tyranny and war. While he says it himself, that certain crises (""shocks"" according to Klein) can be used to introduce otherwise unpopular free market reforms, he does not advocate for, or favor, any kind of crises. Truth be told, with Keynesian and Socialist governments, you will sooner or later have a crises that will open a window of opportunity to act - and as Friedman said himself, the course of action that people take depends on the ideas that are around at the time.",1358812800,3,777,4.713235294117647

This is just a history lesson that has you draw your own conclusions. It makes a major point that should be no surprise to any of us - that ""shocks"" have been opportunistic to the powers that are determined to promote their success above the general welfare.

4255121,4,B0043CI6L6,"This documentary provides an excellent overview of how the American people have been bamboozled by a most insidious form of evil - neo-conservatism.  Cloaked in the mantle of laissez faire (Free Market) economic theory, championed by Milton Freidman and his ideological predecessors - Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich (von) Hayek - academic economists were instrumental in providing the excuses needed to implement the most socially devastating economic programs on the planet since the ill begotten reign of Queen Elizabeth.

Ms. Klein points out the U.S.'s (and the Chicago Boys) involvement in setting up Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in Chile in the 1970s and '80s.  This was to be a demonstration of the correctness and efficiency of unrestrained capitalism, although the actual results were hardly desirable.  Undeterred, this new conservative economic philosophy metastasized in the economic and political policies of the United States and Britain under the malign leadership of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, and ultimately in Russia, under a drunk and misguided Boris Yeltsin.

It is in recalling the awful degradation of humanity by these merchants of greed and corruption that I find this film so disturbing, and at times depressing.  But Ms. Klein provides some solace and hope at the end of the presentation.  She notes how an informed and active populace can (and should) resist the immorality of crisis capitalism.  In the past few years, since the DVD was released, I've seen a number of instances in which people appear to be doing exactly that.  And ultimately, an truly informed and appropriately active population is a very good thing.",1347753600,3,1661,5.333333333333333

After you see it you'll see the news reports of the past regarding foreign countries in a different light & be wary of the current reports.,1321142400,2,245,4.975609756097561
4255125,1,B0043CI6L6,"My review is based on my viewing of the DVD alone and I haven't read the book yet. My first impression is that the central premise is strongly biased against Chicago School of Economics in general and Milton Friedman in particular without providing sufficient evidence, and it's largely a case of ""guilty by association"".

For example, as shown in this documentary Chile went through horrific social economic turmoil and human sufferings under Pinochet dictatorship, but all were blamed directly to free economics of Chicago School only because Milton Friedman's economic thinking was tried to reform and rescue the country's economy. But failure of free economic thinking and policy in one country doesn't automatically makes it a culprit of political repression and exploitation in that country, nor its potential failure in other contries or times. Establishing such causal link against Chicago School seems logically lame and simplistic to me.

The film has too much spin and sensational footages on CIA operations, political unrests, violence, and regime changes around the globe, such as 911, breakup of Soviet Union, and war on terrorism that had little to do with Chicago School of Economics or any school of economic thinking. The documentary mix up economic, military, and political events, policies, and their consequences as if there are all the same and equally responsible for political crisis and social economic disasters, somehow it concludes that US government, Chicago School of Economics, of course, CIA, are responsible for creating those shocks, crisis, and disasters around the globe. The film conveniently overlooks similar social economic crisis in history before Milton Friedman, and it also ""forgets"" mentioning success stories of free markets and capitalism in many parts of the world.

I think the film's premises and arguments against current political establishment would be more convincing if economics and Chicago School had been left out of the picture, but that would seriously weaken the film's argument for a global conspiracy perpetrated by a network of world elites in politics, economics, and military. I can't help but conclude that the premise of ""Shock Doctrine"" is largely built upon convoluted thinking, over generalization, and contradicting evidences.",1319155200,5,2298,5.467605633802817
4255126,4,B0043CI6L6,"William Lee, DVD Verdict --Naomi Klein's 2007 book The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism examines the political and economic history of the last 40 years as a way to explain how democratic nations have strayed from serving the will of the people in favor of enriching the lives of the elite. I haven't read the book but the documentary film The Shock Doctrine works quite well to summarize Klein's thesis and serve as the introduction to the more detailed work. This is clearly and unapologetically a leftist argument so brace yourselves, neoconservatives.

Directors Michael Winterbottom (The Trip) and Mat Whitecross (The Road to Guantanamo) combine video from Klein's speaking tour with historical newsreel and archival footage to illustrate the author's arguments. Approximating the structure of the book, the film introduces viewers to the leading economic theory of the latter twentieth century and show how it was applied in the real world. It's a concise and chilling recounting of the U.S. influence upon other countries during and after the Cold War.

Assembled from video camera footage of Klein's speaking engagements and historical newsreels, the picture quality on this DVD ranges in quality from passable to mediocre. A few interviews fair the best but a lot of the archival clips are scratched and blurry. The image doesn't detract from the impact of this filmic essay's content though. The audio is a respectable stereo mix that lets the narration by Kieran O'Brien (9 Songs) and various interviews be heard clearly. The trailer is the only extra on the disc.
