Having brewed a half dozen or so batches now, I wasn't expecting a ton of new material but I was hoping to see the physicality of some of the steps to compare to my technique. However, if you have brewed even just one batch on your own (no matter how well it went) then this DVD will not provide additional insights to you.

For the beginner brewer, this DVD presents about the same level of detail as you will get reading any number of ""how to"" books on the subject. It's kinda a DVD book, in my opinion, but without any extra benefit than had you just read a book. Home brewing is really easy in a big picture perspective, but you quickly find out that everything is in the details. Explaining those details would have been an awesome part of a video like this.

So if you are absolutely new to the topic, this DVD may be nice to see though that's a pricey $20 for that experience. All of that aside, the people who made this DVD are an EXCELLENT resource for learning how to brew. Their BeerSmith software is INVALUABLE, and their websites and various books are must-haves for anyone wanting to brew as a hobby.

Cheers.",1420934400,9,1242,4.391304347826087

8684439,1,B00OPK9WNC,"I received my DVD this afternoon (10/06/16). The package was a thin bubble package that was tore in a spot, the case was damaged, the prongs that secure the DVD were broke except one, The DVD was loose in the case, and the DVD is scratched over half the disk. I should have paid the extra $5.00 and purchased this DVD at my local brew store.",1477440000,,341,4.181818181818182

8684442,2,B00OPK9WNC,Very disappointing. I was expecting a much more comprehensive discussion on all-grain brewing. This was so high-level. Much better content can be found on youtube or other free sources.,1439337600,3,185,5.413793103448276

8684446,4,B00OPK9WNC,"This video is a good overview of the all-grain process, really aimed at extract brewers that are looking to up their game to all grain, or even BIAB.  It is pretty high-level, though, and glosses over a lot of the details that you will still need to sort out before actually getting into all-grain.  What size brew kettle should I buy?  What other equipment should I get that I don't already have for doing extracts?  How much water, what kind of process for heating water and moving through the steps?  Brad & John know their stuff inside and out, and are very good at explaining the material they covered, but I wish they had gone into a lot more specifics on each step.  The video is useful, but a lot more material and information is needed to implement what they talk about.",1422316800,,779,4.450704225352113
