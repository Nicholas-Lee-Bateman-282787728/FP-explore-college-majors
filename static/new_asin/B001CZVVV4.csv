The orchestra and chorus are outstanding and the total production typical of the Metropolitan Opera company claim to be the best. If you only buy one blu-ray opera DVD, this should be it. Why aren't more of the Met opera productions released in Blu-ray?",1256515200,9,308,4.618181818181818
3521078,5,B001CZVVV4,"This Puritani, which is part of the Metropolitan Opera's series of high definition broadcasts and recordings of live performances, is excellent. The staging is quite conventional, sets and costumes are beautiful, and the singing, especially Netrebko and Relyea, is excellent. The fact that it is available in high definition (Blueray) is an added bonus.",1236816000,14,353,5.555555555555555

8290585,5,B001CZVVV4,"Great opera, beautifully done, but needs a better tenor, as others have mentioned. He looks the part, but his singing is not up to par. However, Ms. Netrebko more than makes up for it with great singing, acting, and beauty.  How can you sing and act like that, on your back. The music, sets,  and costumes are excellent and the Blu-Ray is outstanding.",1414540800,,351,4.555555555555555
8290586,5,B001CZVVV4,"I Puritani was Bellini's last opera; he died, age 33, about seven months after its premiere. It is considered and ""essential piece"" in the Bel Canto repertory, but is infrequently performed, due to its casting requirements. To do justice to the score requires four principal singers with the ability to perform the intricate vocal gymnastics associated with coloratura singers. These demands are particularly difficult to fulfill as to both tenor and soprano parts.

The 2007 Met performance from which this disc was made, was staged to display the amazingly talented Anna Netrebko, using sets that were designed in 1976 for another great soprano, Joan Sutherland. Seeing and hearing Netrebko, and having the CD performance with Sutherland with which to compare it, makes it abundantly clear what an amazingly talented person Anna Netrebko is. In my opinion, she is one of the finest sopranos of our time. For those who doubt (and there are several), one only needs to jump to ""Qui la voce sua soave"" in Act II, where Netrebko displays awesome vocal and dramatic talents.

Remember, gentle reader, that in the early 19th Century, women who were stressed were expected to do one of three things: die, faint or go bonkers (One might validly state that this attitude persisted until Rudyard Kipling penned his immortal ""The female of the species is more deadly than the male"", but I digress ...). Perhaps the most famous mad scene is that in Lucia di Lammermoor, but that is far from the only example in Bel Canto opera. In Puritani, Elvira has two mad scenes and arguably three, since her ... derangement ... persists into the final act. Each of them allows for the utmost vocal and dramatic skills to pull off convincingly. ""Qui la voce"", noted above, is at the heart of the Act II mad scene and lasts for about 17 minutes. To say it is ""demanding"" is not only ""to state the obvious"" but to understate it. For some of the most demanding bars, Netrebko lies on her back, long hair spilling into the orchestra pit and sings ravishingly.

Critics of Netrebko go on about the lack of an extended top, but quality soprano singing is a lot more than E flats and above. Warmth and suppleness of voice, fluid runs and the ability to synthesize emotion into tone are just a few aspects. Netrebko surely pulls out all of the stops, but recall that at the beginning of this (or any) opera,a singer has to asses his/her performance from the perspective of being able to sing well for several hours (about 2 1/2 here). So the ability to push the envelope in Act II, yet have reserves for the final, demanding scene is not insignificant.

I delayed for some time in getting this disc, mainly because the reviews of the DVD pointed to ""tenor issues"". Recall that both Pavarotti and Gedda had serious issues with the extended range of Arturo's part. Only Juan Diego Florez has done it well on DVD, and, if memory serves, even that splendid bel cantist no longer sings it. I could give several technical reasons why Eric Cutler's performance is not the best, but in all fairness, any tenor who can finish this opera without herniating himself deserves credit. So while ""tenor issues"" exist, they are insufficient, in my opinion, to dissuade one from getting this disc.

The remaining principals are also quite good, with special kudos to the very talented Canadian bass, John Relyea and baritone Franco Vassalo who complete this ""Puritani Quartet"" (the term of course was coined to reflect the qualities of the original four, Grisi, Lablache, Tambourini and Rubini who made lots of lira from the nickname).

Chorus and orchestra do exceptionally well under the baton of the very talented Patrick Summers. I am most fond of both the Met Orchestra, arguably the best on the planet, and the chorus, which combine vocal skills with serious dramatics..

Disc quality in Blu ray is superb; it's the perfect visual and auditory display of this marvellous performance.

One heart warming extra feature is the appearance of one of the most exceptional Elvira's of the 20th Century, Beverly Sills, seen and heard here discussing the opera's challenges just a few months before her death.

Not to be missed, gentle reader.",1409961600,5,4193,4.836820083682008
8290587,5,B001CZVVV4,"I might be personally partial to Ms Netrebko and feel she can do no wrong but this is truly a Puritani for the ages. Vocally perhaps not the best Puritani on record but the performance is fantastic. At the end of the Mad Scene in Act II I found myself clapping in my living room her acting is so terrific.  Funny when you hear probably one of the best Elviras ever, Beverly Sills, during the intermission talk about how her teacher pretty much just told her to stand there and sing during the mad scene. I am so glad Ms Netrebko did not share teachers with Ms Sills.  This Puritani will not disappoint !!!",1389398400,2,605,4.298245614035087
8290588,2,B001CZVVV4,"I have over 100 opera and ballet DVD/BR's that I watch on a projected screen about 7' 8"" wide and listen through a 7.1 loudspeaker setup where the left and right speakers are about 9' 6"" apart. The goal is to make the viewing experience as if I was there in a middle seat in one of the front rows.
I have watched this I Puritani a few times now and while this BR receives high praise here (7 times 5 Stars as of today), the DVD reviewers of the same performance are a lot more critical.
While the picture is fine, the audio is certainly not 5 stars.
Although I do see a black clip in one scene in Cutler's hair, that could be part of a body microphone, the sound does not reflect that recording technique. I see no wires/mics. on Netrebko or any other singers. I see a few stage microphones aiming low, probably to record the staircase scenes in act II to the best of their abilities. However, they seemed aimed too low for the principals up front.
To me it sounds like a recording with poorly placed stage microphones only and while the chorus in the back sounds fine, the principals are often too far away from the microphones and sound under-recorded.
At my normal listening level, the soundstage in the surround track barely exceeds the front corner speakers and gives you the impression of sitting in row 15 rather than my preferred row 4. As far as the principal voices are concerned, they often sound even further away.
Playing it at louder levels widens the soundstage and the singers ""come closer"", however now you hear all the background noise of shuffling feet and every page that gets turned in the orchestra. And the singers still don't sound clear.
Applause is also from the front only, barely incorporating the surrounds.
So while Netrebko and to a degree Relyea are still worth watching, the overall audio experience is below average with Cutler sounding strained at the higher notes and Vassallo and Valdes sounding weak and muffled.
Overall not recommended.
The Decca performance with Florez/Machaidze (on 2 dvds) is much better recorded and beats this hands down audio-wise (see my separate review for details).",1335052800,4,2130,4.652519893899204

I liked this production since the first time that I saw it on PBS, even though it took a while to buy it.
I found the cast very good mainly the principal characters:
 Elvira played by Anna Netrebko was very convincing, her transformation when She thought that her fianc was running away with somebody else and performance the ""mad scene"" singing and effortless acting when she dropped to the floor in a frenzy attack continuing singing , at the end she showed her happiness when he returned and married her.
Eric Cutler played Elvira's fianc very well done having a wonderful voice for this role.
John Relyea who I have seen playing other characters in other operas was very good in this role showing his love and concern for her sister.
The scenery, choreography and costumes were very successful, as well as the orchestra and direction were outstanding.
This is a beautiful performance and the quality of this DVD is great, in my opinion deserves 5 stars.",1301097600,9,1111,5.421965317919075
8290590,5,B001CZVVV4,Although Anna Netrebko has always been considered one of the best by my standards. This DVD is one of the best productions. Next best thing to being at the Met in person. She and Eric Cutlers vocals together are remarkable.,1291420800,2,223,4.6

8290593,5,B001CZVVV4,"Blu Ray is the way to see opera if you have a big screen TV and an excellent sound system. You get to see the singer's facial expressions, the look in their eyed, all the nuances of their performances. The cast here is outstanding, especially Anna Netrebko and Eric Cutler who looks so adoringly at Anna when he sings to her, you really believe he's in love with her. Both of their voices are superb as are their vocal gymnastics -- this is Bel Canto-- and their control is extraordinary",1264204800,9,487,4.4222222222222225
