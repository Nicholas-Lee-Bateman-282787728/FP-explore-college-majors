8106293,5,B000E62GSY,"Surprising Penn State and Florida State are paired in a BCS bowl pitting Bobby Bowden and Joe Paterno against one another. Kicking woes make for a long night for both coaches as well as viewers.
This is ABC's complete telecast of the 2006 ORANGE BOWL without commercial interruption. Postgame coverage is available as part of the BONUS FEATURES while pregame and halftime are not offered. Minimal edited huddles are also part of the production but so few as not to detract from the coverage. The picture quality is excellent. Though not a blu-ray, so don't expect a hi-def experience, it is still great.
Good, entertaining game. Excellent quality dvd. Certainly worth having.",1488931200,,675,5.035714285714286
