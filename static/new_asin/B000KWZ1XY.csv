8159454,3,B000KWZ1XY,"Good DVD overall, but again I have to ask what's with the censorship?  The first segment covers Spring Break and of course that has lots of girls flashing sprinkled in (or topless on the beach), yet every single shot has been blurred so none of the nudity is actually visible.  And we're talking gigantic TV-friendly blurring of the entire upper or lower torso area that shows any skin, not just the little blurs that I've seen them use to hide just the nipples or coochie.  WTF??  Why even show topless girls on the beach or girls in skirts sans panties in the clubs if you have to completely obscure it from our view?  Pointless.

The thing that doesn't make any sense is that at the end of the DVD there is a segment at a gentleman's club where there is plenty of unedited topless footage, plus one girl's bottoms are so thin underneath that you definitely get some ""leakage"" of the labia majora and one quick shot where the minora on one side peeked out while she was on all fours.  The footage gets pretty grainy due to the flashing light and movement messing with the video compression, but it's still clear and still enough to show some intimate detail, and uncensored.

This Street Fury has some nice car content and even some good scenery (like a flyover of Hawaii) that is very beautiful.  One of the few Street Fury DVD's that actually has some real substance (the other was Homeland Security, where they really did some cool car stuff).",1422748800,,1448,4.538461538461538
