Good in depth interviews with their record producers. and road managers.  You will learn about their approach to recording albums, and find out how poorly the record company was managing them, as well as their grueling road/performance schedules.

Also a lot of good information on ED King, and Steve Gaines!

Definitely worth a watch!",1451779200,6,487,5.1923076923076925

7342649,4,B0124KY6K8,"This documentary Gone with the Wind: The Remarkable Rise and Tragic Fall of Lynyrd Skynyrd chronologically examines the bands eventual rise to fame, doesnt hold back about their severe bumps along the way. Needless to say: The main focus is Skynryds leader Ronnie Van Zant whos rightfully portrayed as the impetus for their success, but he had help from the likes of The Allman Brothers Band, Al Kooper, bassists turned guitarist Ed King, Tom Dowd, with musical influences from The Rolling Stones and others.
To gain traction Van Zant ceaselessly rehearsed the band to find the sound he was looking for. But it wasn't until Al Kooper heard the group in a club Atlanta, Ga in 72 that Kooper was able to get them signed to the MCA recording label  albeit with an imperfect contract that stunk. Skynyrd was broke and needed to sign the deal; in the long-run proved to be a wise decision. That flawed deal got them to record at the legendary Muscle Shoals Studios in Alabama, (produced by Al Kooper) launched their recording career with 1973s Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd an album that fashioned Gimme Three Steps, Simple Man, and their signature Free Bird. Next came 1974s Second Helping also a success, didn't have the dreaded sophomore jinx. Kooper guided them to loftier heights with classics like Sweet Home Alabama where Van Zant answered Neil Young for his comments on Southern Man. Plus Workin for MCA, the chilling and probable biographical The Needle and the Spoon, and the take-no-prisoners cover of J.J. Cales Call Me the Breeze. It was at this time Kooper suggested his friend Pete Townsend that Skynyrd would be an excellent opening band for The Who, who on-tour were promoting Quadrophenia. Kooper continues to opine that The Who were additionally famously generous with their drugs a scenario Skynryd did not need additional coaxing with.
As the alcohol and drugs took their toll and MCAs demand for constant touring and another new album they released their third recording in three years; 1975s Nuthin Fancy, also produced by Al Kooper that gave us Saturday Night Special, and Whiskey Rock-A-Roller offering the band as a generic rocking band that sort of lost touch with their Southern roots and appeal. Unfortunately Nuthin Fancy was not their best commercially selling album to date. 1976s Gimme Back My Bullets also showed signs of wear, Kooper was fired and even with the great Tom Dowds production  it was initially obvious that Dowd wasn't a good fit for the band. It wasn't a bad album, but it was a disappointment that yielded few memorable tunes and an unusual co-authoring with Traffics Jim Capaldi and Steve Winwood writing with Allen Collins and Van Zant on Every Mothers Son, a song that could have been special, but is long forgotten. They also tried another J.J. Cale cover I Got the Same Old Blues that also failed to energize.
Double live albums were commonplace in the seventies, Skynyrd was known for its sharp live performances so after the disappointing studio releases it was a savvy move to issue One More From the Road landing in the stores just months after Gimme Back My Bullets. The live album was enthusiastically embraced entering the Top Ten and would become their best-selling album  also produced by Tom Dowd, adding background vocalists Leslie Hawkins, Jo Jo Billingsley, and Cassie Gaines the sister of the recently added guitarist Steve Gaines. Also notable; are live covers by bluesmen Jimmie Rodgers T for Texas, and Robert Johnsons Crossroads.
1977s Street Survivors (also produced by Tom Dowd) dropped just prior to the plane crash. It was a heck of an album that fashioned That Smell reeked of death, now categorized as eerie. Energized by the success of One More From the Road the band ascends with the gifted guitarist Steve Gaines (who like his sister Cassie, and Van Zant perished in the plane crash.) Note the two co-authored (Van Zant  Gaines) You Got that Right, and I Never Dreamed, plus singular Gaines tunes I Know a Little, and Aint No Good Life. The album Street Survivors also included Whats Your Name, the album version of That Smell, and a cover of Merl Haggards Honky Tonk Night Time Man.
I enjoyed this documentary, but need to inform that its nearly three hours long Its narrated by Thomas Arnold and was written and directed by Tom ODell. The interview segments are solid especially the recent comments by Ed King, and later day drummer Artimus Pyle. Alan Pauls observations are also very insightful and suggest mind provoking thoughts. Note Pauls work with The Allman Brothers Band and his excellent and recent book One Way Out: The inside History of the Allman Brothers Band.
But: I need to call out the snobbish and boring Robert Christgau; the self-professed Dean of Rock Critics for his lame comments about The Allman Brothers writing skills. Christgau rightfully states that Duane Allman wasn't a good songwriter but omits the fact that Duane only wrote one (instrumental) song, had Duane been alive today Im sure he would also tell us that songwriting wasn't his thing. Christgau also states that Dickey Betts wasn't that great of a songwriter thats debatable. He then goes onto speak about the (rightful) writing talents of Ronnie Van Zant. But this pompous Christgau fool doesnt bother mentioning about Gregg Allmans songwriting skills? Give me a break.
Nonetheless and historically speaking this DVD documentary is a fitting (and long overdue) tribute to a great Southern Rock band. Whose tragic demise came too soon that ending abruptly. This is recommended viewing  enjoy.

7342650,4,B0124KY6K8,"Being a fan for nearly 40 years I was interested in this DVD. This one focuses on original drummer, Bob Burns, his replacement Artimus Pyle, along with Ed King, guitar player who left before the crash.  Also their tour manager and some record management members

  This is nothing from Gary or Johnny.  Not much mention of Leon or Billy either.  Now does that mean it is poor? No.

  I found the interviews from Bob Burns to shed some new light on why he left and how the band behaved. Glad it was documented before he passed. Ed provided some new information also about why he left and about the band and their addictions.  Artimus speaks about being on tour with Bob while he was training to replace him. The tour manager and Gene Odom, Ronnie's friend tell a bit more about the crash and not learning about what happened to band members until after they left hospital. In Gene's case they drove him to Ronnie's grave site when he asked to see him.

  Most of the video is stuff that was in Behind the Music or Freebird.  Again it is well done, but understand it is really former members and do not expect to see much on the original members.

  So if you wish to learn more from those who have not been featured before, this is for you",1448150400,24,1238,4.336244541484716
7342651,5,B0124KY6K8,"I am an avid Lynyrd Skynyrd fan; have been for decades. I even got to spend some time with many of them behind the Savannah Civic Center before a concert during the 1988 Tribute Tour. They were barbecuing and we walked up and started chatting with them. I, and the friend that was with me, were just a couple of 20 year old nobodys. However, Artimus, Billy, Leon, Gary, Lacy Van Zant & Gene Odom treated us as if we were invited friends to a family get together. In a world full of arrogant & pretentious  prima dona celebrities these guys stand out. My story is one of thosands like it about this band. They had reached pinnacle of success yet never forget who took them there, or where they came from.
I came along 10 years too late to see them in full bloom with Ronnie at the helm. However, his documentary DVD took me to where I couldn't go. It tells the Skynyrd story warts and all. It is a must see for any Skynyrd fan.",1515974400,3,926,4.202247191011236

7342664,1,B0124KY6K8,"Although, some very interesting new bits of information, the documentary leaves out key voices who should've contributed (Gary Rossington, Rickey Medlocke, Donnie Van Zant, Johnny Van Zant, Ronnie's Wife and family, family members of the other band members). Most of the commentary is by Robert Christgau (who arrogantly wears a NY Yankees T-shirt during the entire interview, and can't even properly remember the name of ""Gimme Three Steps"") What a douche.

They were also trying to paint Ronnie as a left wing sympathizer by analyzing a single line (out of context) in Sweet Home Alabama. ""In Bermingham they love the Governor"", yet completely failing to see that he was mocking this liberal ""DEMOCRAT"" with the ""Boo, Boo, Boo"" refrain.

In addition, in the next two lines of Sweet Home Alabama, Ronnie states ""Watergate does not bother me, Does your concious bother you...tell the truth!"" Which is a direct response to the Democratic outrage over Watergate, which pales in comparison to the atrocities Liberals and Progressives have committed in recent times (i.e. Clintons). Yet...they never even went that far in their analysis.

Lastly, the injection of the stock video footage (with the ""old timey"" scratched film filter) behind certain songs was a cheap effect. They ended up looking like amateur, YouTube music video from a high schooler.

I thought Al Kooper provided a honest commentary. You can tell he really cared for these guys. He seemed very genuine in contrast to the self serving commentaries by Robert Christgau. There were also several another critics/biographers/friends who provided some excellent commentary too (Sorry...I wish I captured their names).

I love that the NEW incarnation of Lynyrd Skynyrd upsets Robert Christgau so much because of their ""right wing, Fox news watching agenda"" (obviously filmed before the big, historical election upset of 2016). Just shows what an out-of-touch, self serving creep he really is. But, I'll try to forgive him...somehow, someday.",1494806400,4,2000,5.3164556962025316

But, after watching this amazing and heartbreaking film
I now understand why so many people are still die hard fans
If you are already a massive fan of the band (You might find it interesting and enjoyable)
I guess that all depends on what info you already know
A film this fascinating should be shown at every music class
I'm sure ""there"" story could inspire many people

It Chronicles the rise and fall of a band  it's extremely interesting from start to finish
The first 25min is a slow burn but, once it picks up it's compelling

If you love any styles of music see this film, If you are a fan of VH-1's Behind the Music you'll really dig it

7342683,5,B0124KY6K8,"There was new information about the crash, primarily from gene odum who is the only person who has ever talked about Ronnie on the plane. Childhood friend, hired as Ronnie's unofficial bodyguard, In this latest version Odum says he feels certain Ronnie was ""not in his seat"", I.E. on the floor. For decades Odum claimed to have buckled Ronnie in after pulling him half drugged and asleep from the floor. In this latest version he seems to finally come clean. Well partially. It seems he has told friends privately for years Ronnie was on the floor, Ronnie resisted and Gene wasn't going to fight him. None of the other band members mere feet away did a thing to help either. However this negative image would have destroyed the band's reputation, they let the lead singer, leader, and soul of Skynyrd ride out a crash landing laying on the floor, and nobody would do that to a dog. So in this version Gene says at the last moments he tried to help Ronnie but Ronnie resisted. BS. Ron Eckerman and Billy Powell both are on record the plane GLIDED for up to 12-15 minutes at a normal descent rate of 5 degrees. There was time for all those strong young men to help an incapacitated RVZ. They were cowards. That is the big secret revealed here. The ""boys"" he handpicked were now men and let Ronnie ride it out on his own. Today Odum states Van Zant probably smothered, he was already at he front bulkhead, unfastened, on the floor, and everyone in that plane and all their seats and luggage landed right on Ronnie. Whether by a head blow or smothering Ronnie may have died because his friends did not help him. 20 out of 24 survived, it was a remarkable survivable crash. Just not for someone laying on the floor during a crash landing. I am sure Ronnie would have forgiven his mates for not helping him, it  was a terrible 15 minutes. So it's up to each fan to decide if the survivors like Gary Rossington who tours today as Lynyrd Skynyrd, the lone survivor left,  should be asked why was his best friend and mentor Ronnie on the floor during a crash landing? Rossington for 40 years has refused to talk in detail about the crash. Now we know why, Judy Van Zant would have sued his pants off.",1470528000,,2191,4.447761194029851

You really get to know the individual band members, and the story of their climb to success is quite interesting and inspiring.  My only minor complaint is that they very quickly glossed over the tragic plane crash at the end of the film.  One of my main reasons in purchasing this documentary was to learn more about what really happened.  Every other source I've read gives the same minor details and I was hoping this film would have deeper insight and perhaps more interviews on the tragedy and more details that we hadn't already learned about.  As I said, this documentary very quickly glossed over the incident at the end,  almost as a side note.  Other than that, I can't imagine finding a more comprehensive exploration and history of this epic band.",1461542400,,830,4.7622377622377625

There was no mention of RVZ hitting Bob Burns in the head with a baseball.

The current band are mentioned (not uncritically in Robert Christgau's case) but obviously did not participate in the film.

Contributions from Alan Walden and Al Kooper are insightful.

7342699,5,B0124KY6K8,"Just watched this with the wife and it is long and it is informative. If I were to be nitpicky; 1,) I love Skynyrds First and Last and see now Skynyrds First which is the complete Muscle Shoals recording, I feel that portion of the recordings were not covered quite as much as it should have been. Ricky Medlocke singing ""White Dove"" is a big highpoint of the album but this documentary only said he was hired along with the other fellow for the sessions and nothing about their complete contributions. Even though Ricky went on to form Blackfoot, I think a little more on him should have been shown. 2.) I really didn't like the smug critique about the group that took up the torch to continue Lynyrd Skynyrd. Sure this is not Lynyrd Skynyrd as it was before the crash definitely but this is more of a celebration as there are many fans that still hold the name dear and with Van Zandts brother fronting this incarnation of the band, that is alright with them. I myself would never by an album by them but don't make them out to pirates or ghouls either.

Thats it for the nitpicky portion. Did like going through each album and how they were made. The love/hate with Ronnie and Ed King (who I really respect as a great musician and with Strawberry Alarm Clock), the acquisition of the girl group and Steve Gaines and everything in between. Just so happened the biggest spokesmen were the two drummers Bob Burns, Artimus Pyle and Ed King as far as group members go. All the other people and Al Kooper were essential in telling this story as well.

These were southern boys and rowdy rebellious southern boys at that. If your are going to get this, also buy Allman Brothers Song of the South as parts of that video are included in this as well.
