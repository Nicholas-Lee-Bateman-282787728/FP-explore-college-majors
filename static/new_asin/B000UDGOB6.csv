2920427,2,B000UDGOB6,"I'm usually a big fan of the classic scifi/horror flicks.  These 2 are real sleepers though.  I'll give credit to the actors, but the plots leave much to be desired.  I guess the titles didn't fit the movie, and the artwork was somewhat overdone.",1301443200,,246,4.545454545454546

2920430,4,B000UDGOB6,"I bought this tape for the Beast with a million eyes. It was made on a very low budget but the acting is solid and the plot entertaining. Don't expect a great looking monster,the poster is the best thing about the monster. From what i have read in horror books the director took a coffey pot and added scratches to the film to make it look like rays,plus a sock puppet was added. This said,it is still an interesting low budget feature about a creature who lands in the dessert and starts controling the animals minds and the minds of the people living on an isolated date farm ranch.a subplot is about the wife who feels her life is wasted living on  a broken down farm. The plot comes together when it is discovered love can beat the mind control when the farmers daughters mind is taken over. It sounds hokey but i enjoyed it. For those expecting lots of blood forget it,it is more of a psychological horror-sci fi movie.",1247097600,14,924,4.4035087719298245
2920431,4,B000UDGOB6,"Two very cheap black & white ARC (later AIP) alien invader movies, but the cheapest of the two, BEAST, is by far the most interesting (though possibly because I'd never seen it). The alien in it is housed in an espresso machine that crash lands in the desert and plots world domination by utilizing the eyes of insects and animals surrounding a failing guest ranch run by a weary Paul Birch, his bitter, unfulfilled wife (convincingly played by Lorna Thayer, who more famously refused Jack Nicholson his toast years later in FIVE EASY PIECES), their perky daughter (Dona Cole), whom mom secretly resents (nice touch!), and a hired hand they all call ""Him"" who lives in a tiny shack in the yard with girlie magazine cutouts all over the walls and who spies on the daughter when she goes swimming! Also on hand as alien bait is silent screen legend Chester Conklin, who does a little warmed-over pantomime before ""the beast"" possesses one of his cows. Cheap beyond belief, and statically directed with an early Paul Blaisdell creature design that leaves a lot to be desired--a jiggling puppet with double-exposure ""giant eye"" to offset its mediocre appearance--but there's a sincerity to the performances, notably Thayer's, that makes this a keeper.

PHANTOM, the better quality film print here, has long been available in PD versions, but this is by far the best it's ever looked, although the ""widescreen"" presentation gives me pause. Basically another science-gone-wrong flick in which a shady oceanographer (Michael Whalen), keen on exploiting an underwater uranium vein to create a death ray, unleashes the titular sea critter, while his sexy and somewhat oblivious daughter (Kathy Downs) romances the Fed (Kent Taylor) assigned to the case. The ""phantom"" bears a strong resemblance to the Creature from the Black Lagoon, only less mobile.",1241308800,26,1842,5.079207920792079

The second one was at least about a real/fake creature! It was okay. A little difficult to be entertained by since there was too much dialogue and not enough cheesiness! The monster was BLAST to watch! There should have been more!

The Beast With A Million Eyes is also very entertaining. The ever reliable Paul Birch heads the cast which includes an early performance by a very young Dick Sargent.

There is no special effect in this movie that couldn't have been done in the 1950s, and the acting styles match that era perfectly, right down to the flat affect voice of the Beast and that disembodied eye hovering there, watching over everything.

2920489,3,B000UDGOB6,"A fun movie, ""The Beast with a Million Eyes"" is unlikely to be your favorite.  It is classic 1950s era science fiction.

The premise is interesting.  The ""million eyes"" does not mean the Beast has a body with a million physical eyes.  Rather, this movie was an early ""body snatcher"" story.  This ""beast"" comes to Earth to prepare it for domination by an Alien Force.  (Insert eerie music here.)  These ETs have no direct physical form.  Instead, they take control of other animals.  The Beast begins its Earthly Dominance by controlling one animal.  Then many birds.  Add a dog and cow for good measure.  (Moo!)  A few more animals.  Finally graduating to humans...  (Replay eerie music.)  This beast thrives by usurping negative emotions and lower intelligence.  The ""million eyes"" refers to the Beasts million animals it can control and the ability to extend its reach through them, seeing into your very heart and soul!  (More eerie music, please!)

Okay, a bit corny.  I said fun, not deep and rich in flavor! :)

As you'd expect, the special effects are dated.  Often the movie (smartly) tries to imply a scene, rather than show it.  Some of the silliest scenes involve ""bird attacks"" that look, well, you get the point.  That aside, it's sufficient to keep the plot moving and retain some element of suspense.

Acting is also fit for a B-grade movie.  It's not bad.  Can't say it's particularly good, either.

This movie is good if you want to see a Horror-esque SciFi without thinking too much or wetting your bed at night.  You won't confuse it with ""Alien"" though.

Parents need to use their judgement.  While this movie is less than realistic, there are elements that children could find intense, especially younger kiddos who may not have fully completed their developmental journey into distinguishing real/now, real history (news), real-based fiction, and... this stuff.",1396051200,,1883,4.920127795527157
2920490,4,B000UDGOB6,"I was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining this low budget film was.  Filmed entirely in and around a ranch nestled in a date palm grove in what I believe is the S. Californian Mohave desert, the story is about an alien craft that lands and starts to take over the minds of animals and ""the weak minded"", and how a dysfunctional family is brought together and finds out that when united by love, they can beat the beast.  (The million eyes refers to its ability to take over animals and see through them - the beast, seen briefly at the end of the movie only has two.)

I did find the movie to be very inconsistent - there are a several shots that are worthy of an art film (note the pinwheel on the wall framed beautifully in the background in one scene), yet others are very amateurish.  This is apparently the first and only film that David Kramarsky directed, though he is credited as producer on other movies including ""The Cry Baby Killer"" in which Jack Nicholson made his screen debut.  I chuckled out loud at a few of the mad cow shots, and when the chickens were attacking Lorna Thayer who plays the mother of the Dade family.  She showed real terror as the live chickens were hurled at her face from off-screen, but unfortunately it was funny, not scary.  Thayer's acting is also inconsistent - at times very believable, at others almost a caricature.  Paul Birch does a little better.  Watch for a very young Dick Sargeant in a secondary role - you might know him as the second Darren from the TV series ""Bewitched"".  Perhaps the best acting is done by Duke the German Shepherd when he's taken over by the beast.  The music, composed by John Bickford is also inconsistent but interesting, especially the opening theme.  Apparently this is also the first and only film that Bickford scored.  Likewise the editing is inconsistent and sometimes jarring - closeups that were obviously filmed as pick-up shots (probably by a different director) are interspersed with more spacious, well framed shots and beautiful landscapes.

The ending has a cute twist and the following memorable lines:

""Where did the eagle come from?  Why do men have souls?""
""If I could answer that I'd be more than human.  I'd be...""
""Yes.""

All that said, I really enjoyed this movie.  It might be suitable for younger children as well, since it's scary enough to be interesting but all the violence and gore are implied, not on-screen, and there's a nice moral at the end.  If you like 50's science-fiction with cheesy special effects you should definitely give this one a shot.  Otherwise, you'll probably want to pass.",1395187200,,2606,4.671052631578948
2920491,4,B000UDGOB6,"I like these 1950 era movies.  Someone use to modern special effects, monsters, gore, and skin will be disappointed.  Well there was a monster, a little one, for a short period.  The space ship looked liked someone's pressure cooker (it had lights though).  Never-the-less the story was good, the acting was a little over the top (as were most movies at this time) but better than I've seen in some of today's Sci-Fi movies.  The set was a little quirky, a date palm farm, in the desert?  If you like old Sci-Fi movies this one's for you, if not stay away, you'll be bored.",1392681600,,573,4.461538461538462

2920494,4,B000UDGOB6,"American International Pictures or AIP as they were generally known was probably the most influential distribution company in American movie history. Over the course of a quarter century (1954-1979) they released over 450 movies and launched the careers of such notable directors as James Cameron & Martin Scorsese and performers Bruce Dern & Jack Nicholson. AIP head honchos James H. Nicholson & Samuel Z. Arkoff cultivated the youth market of moviegoers by playing their films in drive-ins, exploiting whatever the hot topic of the moment was, and having a nose for young talent. Look them up on imdb for a list of the films they released and you'll see what an incredible impact they had on American movies. This 4 feature set (on one DVD) allows us to see 2 features from AIP's earliest days to 2 movies made in their prime.

First up is THE PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES, shot for less than $100,000. The film was released in 1955 and capitalizes on 2 big movies from the year before, CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON and 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. It's actually pre-AIP as it uses the company's original name, American Releasing Corporation. It deals with the hot button topic of the 1950s, atomic radiation and throws in a monster to boot. It is surprisingly well made from a technical standpoint but the performances from no-name stars are nothing to write home about. The flip side is THE BEAST WITH 1,000,000 EYES which was shot for about $30,000 and far exceeds its budget in what it achieves although the coffee pot spaceship has to be seen to be believed. Both features are in black & white and the quality of the prints is remarkably good considering their age and stature.

The second DVD features color movies from 1965 and 1976 respectively. Both were shot in England where the costs were lower and the personnel quality was higher. WAR GODS OF THE DEEP  (ridiculous title) marks the final film of the great Jacques Tourneur (CAT PEOPLE) and should have been part of the Vincent Price-Edgar Allan Poe series. It incorporates a lot of Jules Verne and has some ridiculous dialogue and wooden performances but Tourneur's use of color and light and shadow and the always watchable Vincent Price make it succeed in spite of itself. The same cannot be said of AT THE EARTH'S CORE. Some fascinating ideas are defeated by some really juvenile special effects and some really juvenile performances. Peter Cushing is on hand to recycle his Dr Who persona but under a different name. It was my least favorite.

WAR GODS OF THE DEEP & AT THE EARTH'S CORE were originally released on the old MGM MIDNITE MOVIES series. They were originally single DVDs and then were combined as a double feature. That 2 sided DVD has been reissued here without any kind of upgrade by 20th Century Fox who now own the distribution rights to the entire MIDNITE MOVIE series. PHANTOM FROM 10,000 LEAGUES and BEAST WITH 1,000,000 EYES have been given newer transfers complete with subtitles for those who need them. The print quality ranges from excellent to very good on all 4 films. There are no real extras but the price is certainly right. This collection serves as a fascinating time capsule from one of the most significant companies in Hollywood history, a fact that would have astounded Nicholson & Arkoff who set out with nothing more in mind than making a few bucks.",1386288000,13,3358,4.774526678141136
2920495,5,B000UDGOB6,"This is a fantastic old Sci-fi set of four films on two discs (each one flips over so there's one film for each side) and here's the most important thing I can tell you: Big Lots has this 4-film set (this exact DVD, as of 11-25-13) for THREE DOLLARS. I bought it yesterday. So go get it! Two of these films are in beautiful period color/letterbox and the other two are in black and white and, as I recall, at least one of them is letterbox, maybe both. If you have any questions about them, just ask and I'll try to respond quickly.

These period Drive-in double feature films are for us old-timers who like the hokey old monster/sci-fi flicks so if you're not into that, don't waste your money.",1385424000,2,695,4.346153846153846
2920496,4,B000UDGOB6,"War Gods Of The Deep was surprisingly entertaining for me. Far from Academy Award material but innocent fun. And it's impossible to fault any Vincent Price performance. I would say pretty much the same about At The Earth's Core. Phantom From 10,000 Leagues was just boring. Beast With A Million Eyes was simple but with an ultimately powerful, timeless message that would serve the world well: Love and respect for one another will always defeat evil. Can't deny it.",1381104000,4,466,4.9113924050632916

2920498,3,B000UDGOB6,"We bought this because our copy of Phantom from 10,000 Leagues got ruined. ""Phantom"" is fun for people who like monsters in rubber costumes and characters who take themselves so seriously you can't help but laugh. ""Beast"" leaves much to the imagination, and is pretty creepy. Neither is plausible, which is part of the fun.",1371686400,4,323,4.890909090909091
2920499,3,B000UDGOB6,"I take no pleasure in writing this review (it will be less informative than ""Brian's""). ""Midnite Movies have a job letting anyone down with their choice of sometimes obscure, sometimes unknown, sometimes quite well known films, all good quality or the best available. The 4 films on these 2 discs are pretty awful as films. ""PHANTOM"" is real Poverty Row only just saved by good photography and Kent Taylor and Cathy Downs. ""BEAST"" ditto, saved by nothing. At one pointI did wonder if Russ Meyer was directing, but don't worry, there is no sex. Sadly there is nothing at all to make me enjoy this boring rubbish. I am sure Russ wouldn't have been boring.""WAR GODS"" is surely Jaques Tourneur's worst film? Poor pacing, dreadful miscasting and a weak performence from Price make this pretty boring stuff. ""AT THE EARTH'S CORE""is probably the best of the bunch, but only just. Far too dark in places and poorly paced with really silly ""Dr WHO"" monsters (From the early series), this only survives for me because of Cushing, McLure and 3rd billed Caroline Munro. What a shame she wasn't a very good actress. I met her briefly (with Martine Beswick) at a Film Fair/Convention here in London last year ad she is still beautiful and very charming. Anyway, I have rumbled on far too much. For me this is the first really disapointing MIDNITe MOVIES DVD, but price, picture quality remain very good and VFM, so if in doubt take a chance. The films could be right up your street...",1369440000,4,1470,4.7015503875969
2920500,3,B000UDGOB6,"The title, THE BEAST WITH A MILLION EYES evokes images of some gigantic, tentacle-covered horror from beyond time and space. Something from the nightmares of HP Lovecraft. Well, not so much. The ""beast"" of the film is actually an industrial-sized coffee pot w/ some spinning attachment that makes the world's most annoying humming sound! This alien presence is out to feed on the brains of earthlings, causing insanity and death. But wait! The invader has one weakness. It cannot overcome the power of L-O-V-E! Yep, once again, love conquers all, even sentient coffee pots. TBWAME is pure 50s sci-fi cheeeze at its most gooey...",1367193600,2,628,5.048076923076923
2920501,3,B000UDGOB6,"While nothing indispensable, there are a couple bright spots among the four B-films assembled in this generally lackluster sci-fi/horror/fantasy collection-- which is pretty much par for the course for most things released under MGM/Fox's delightfully schizophrenic 'Midnite Movies' banner.  Set includes:

'The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues' (1955) - A few cheap thrills (and I mean cheap) and a sad rubber sea creature are about all this atomic-age admonition has to offer.  Produced by the deservedly forgotten Milner Bros. ('From Hell It Came') and starring almost-was Cathy Downs ('My Darling Clementine'), 'Phantom' is a cinematic wet blanket that bears no relation to Jules Verne, Gaston Leroux, Ray Harryhausen or anything else legit its title may evoke.  1 1/2 stars.

'The Beast with 1,000,000 Eyes' (1958) - Existential alien-invasion/posession flick that uses its lack of budget (allegedly less than $30,000) fairly effectively to tell an eerie little tale, relying mainly on suggestion instead of silly costumes or camera tricks (even at times modestly foreshadowing Hitchcock's nature-gone-amok masterpiece, 'The Birds').  Working against its interesting premise and setting (California's Colorado Desert, which gives the film a desolate, almost post-apocalyptic feel), however, are bad acting, sloppy editing and often unintentionally funny exposition (particularly from the alien 'narrator').  2-plus stars.

'War Gods of the Deep' (a.k.a. 'City in the Sea,' UK, 1965) - For my money the most polished and entertaining of the set, this kids' fantasy/adventure-- sort of Captain Nemo meets 'Undersea Kingdom,' inspired by Poe's verse-- serves primarily as a Vincent Price vehicle, but boasts some nice sets and vivid photography in the hands of atmosphere junkie Jacques Tourneur ('Cat People,' 'The Leopard Man,' 'Out of the Past').  3-plus stars.

'At the Earth's Core' - This 1976 AIP/Amicus (UK) clunker, while well-paired with 'War Gods,' is a throwback to Wells/Verne adaptations from a generation earlier (think 'First Men in the Moon,' 'The Time Machine' or 'Mysterious Island' sans their 'modern' effects).  High-school-play production values hamper the too-familiar subterranean-exploration plot, with the great Peter Cushing bringing little more than comic relief to an already impossibly hammy affair.  2 stars.

Picture and audio quality are reasonably good on all counts (the items from the '50s are b&w and show considerably more age-related wear than their color counterparts), 'Beast' being the only feature not presented in anamorphic widescreen.  Overall, a solid 3-star package (containing two dual-sided discs) for the price, and for those who don't mind a thick slice of cheese with their popcorn.",1357948800,14,2732,5.680589680589681

2920503,2,B000UDGOB6,"Many put down low-budget 1950s sci-fi films but a number of them are fun to watch today, partly from nostalgia of growing up in the period. Those made by studios like American International did a fine job on low budgets but others, such as these, are among those that give the genre its bad reputation. The ""acting"" in ""Beast"" is especially bad, making Ed Wood look good by comparison. The soundtrack hilariously is a ""Wagner's Greatest Hits"" medley. ""Phantom"" is considerably better by comparison.",1332201600,2,498,4.940476190476191
2920504,4,B000UDGOB6,"Like a torn spot in a circle the camera moves past the lush, irrigated palm trees to reveal the horror of what lies beyond the artificial  circle of serenity: the bleak, unforgiving desert. Roger Corman makes sure the narrator imbeds this in your mind.

You become hot & irritated at the uneventful, slow pace of this film...just like the actress that you realize you are becoming empathic with.

Later, a scratched and feathered car will not be run out of town to demonstrate the frailty of modern living in a hostile, now controlled, wilderness. The family will huddle together at the end of a fence (at the end of their line) at the gateway to this horror.

Several subjective shots of people getting close to the u.f.o. will show in the background the contrails of military aircraft as if to prove that this mysterious craft evaded the Airforce. Spielberg would have spent a million dollars and waited for the sky to clear.

There were A, B, and Z science fiction films in the 50's. This is the best of the Z's, a distinction.",1327968000,5,1030,4.60655737704918

Not terrible(with the exception of 1,000,000 Eyes) but just not up to the excellence that I would expect from these great actors! I would have given this 3 stars except for the fact that you get three decent movies for the price! Surprisingly, this has closed captioning! RP",1524096000,,433,4.7105263157894735
