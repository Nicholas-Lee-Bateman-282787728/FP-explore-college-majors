8469060,5,B005ETQ2PY,"An excellent movie, featuring an early Johnny Sekka, Sylvia Syms, & veterans Brenda De Banzie, & John Mills.  This movie is an interesting look at how someone who may profess certain ideologies, might respond when forced to deal with circumstances which put those ""principles"" to the test.",1447718400,,289,5.148936170212766
8469061,5,B005ETQ2PY,"John Mills was a much admired British Film star. In this story he faces the question
of his own deep rooted predjudice. I prefer this more down to earth production far more than
""Whose coming to dinner"" made in the USA. The stage is early post war Englamd and in the season of Guy Fawkes
or ""Bonfire Night"" .  One fascinating  note about the titling is why the boyfriend is hardly given mention,
and his character given such meagre developement.  The quality of the film is excellent as is the sound.",1373500800,,500,4.472527472527473
8469062,3,B005ETQ2PY,"Years before the U.S.'s Guess Who's Coming to Dinner examined mixed marriage, John Mills and company did so in England. The action and reactions prove more visceral in Great Britain, with labor unions, motorcycle riding punks, family, neighbors, and friends joining the brouhaha when Mills' screen daughter brings home a most unexpected fianc and Mills stands up for black workers where he is a union boss.
Spencer Tracy and cast may have pulled their punches in the American movie; the British cast does not.",1371600000,,509,5.071428571428571
8469063,4,B005ETQ2PY,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It is mainly about two people from different races (e.g. white woman and black man) taking huge risks so that they can be together. This probably took place in England because of the accent people spoke. She told her parents that she wanted to marry the black guy regardless of how they felt about it.

The only thing I did not like much was the ending. I wished that their upcoming wedding was shown and included in the movie.",1322352000,,458,4.4523809523809526
