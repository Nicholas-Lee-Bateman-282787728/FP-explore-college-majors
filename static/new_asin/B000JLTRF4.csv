2677177,4,B000JLTRF4,"Healthily into its third season, it's only now that BEN 10's freshman year is finally coming out in dvd in all its thirteen episode glory. Debuting in December 27, 2005 on the Cartoon Network, BEN 10 was an immediate hit with the fans as the show, boasting a very cool concept, proved to be fun and eminently watchable. Plus, that theme song rocks.

The premise: Ordinary 10 year old Ben Tennyson comes upon a mysterious alien artifact (resembling a wristwatch) which grants him temporary access to the forms of ten alien species, each of whom is inherently imbued with its own superhuman ability. In the constant company of his wise and benign grandfather Max (who hints of an enigmatic past, proving that being a ""plumber"" is more exciting than one would think) and his clever, sassy cousin Gwen (who he initially dislikes), Ben, early on, learns his lessons as he heroically attempts to abide by the famous Spidey quote: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" But his attempts to live up to that credo are at constant odds with his more carefree and mischievous pre-adolescent tendencies. Accordingly, he strives to use his new-found super powers to nab villains, all the while keeping at bay the maurauding alien, octopus-faced Vilgax, who will stop at nothing to own the Omnitrix. But, as civic minded as he has become, that doesn't mean that young Ben can't have any fun...

The hook, of course, is that this young, normal kid all of a sudden gains and gets to play with the powers of ten formidable alien beings. Part of the fun is in witnessing Ben discover all the diverse forms (some of which are strange and kinda gross, and one, Ghostfreak, even really unnerving) he comes to inhabit and his varying reactions to 'em. These ten beings are rendered as visually striking and colorful, my two personal favorites being Heatblast and Upgrade. And, oh, yeah, for those who were wondering, these ten aliens whose shapes and abilities Ben can borrow, in no particular order, are: Upgrade (a biomechanical being who can integrate itself into any machine and instantly improve upon or ""upgrade"" it), Four Arms (a bruising, 12-foot-tall, four-armed alien with awesome strength), Heatblast (an incendiary individual whose race dwells on a sun), Diamondhead (the near invulnerable, crystalline being), XLR8 (capable of immense super speed), Ripjaws (the aquatic alien), Grey Matter (the miniscule alien, standing at 5"" tall), Ghostfreak (creepy and spectre-like), Stinkfly (a winged insectoid alien), and Wildmutt (a quilled, bestial creature).

And, now, for the self-righteous, holier-than-thou part of the review: this show is perfectly catered for our impressionable young 'uns. With the expected, patented family values, as well as the mainstay credo of trying to do the right thing, being wholesomely espoused throughout the episodes (and in a non-sanctimonious way), kids should find themselves entertained as they are simultaneously taught the classic, goody-two-shoes virtues. The interactions among Ben, Grandpa Max, and Gwen are nicely portrayed as his supportive gramps and his more mature cousin strive to keep the impulsive Ben on the proper path (because Ben does lose it and act out every now and then).

Its cartoony animation is well suited to BEN 10, meshing with the show's sensibilities. This series is meant to be light, innocent, and fun-filled, in spite of all the heavy sci-fi action, and these qualities are perfectly conveyed by the clean lines and caricatured look. Young kids certainly wouldn't mind, and Ben's otherworldly personas are depicted in a nifty and energetic enough manner. The look and style of BEN 10, actually, leans towards the anime style and recalls TEEN TITANS to mind. I kinda like it.

Now, the minuses. Other than the very alluring hook of being ten different superheroes, there's really nothing new about this series. One improvement I can think of is that this show would be better served with more cohesion and more episodic continuity. Multi-part episodes would be very welcome. As it is right now, the formulaic plot has the Tennyson family travelling to some destination, only to encounter the supervillain flavor-of-the-week (although several of these baddies are sicced on by the series's main villain, Vilgax). Don't get me wrong, there is some character development and these are pretty cool stand alone episodes, but BEN 10 seemingly lacks that certain focus; and the show's story arc and plot progression are developing too slowly for my taste. But, hey, that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop watching this series. When you get to the nitty-gritty, BEN 10 is just too much fun to miss out. Not to mention, Seasons 2 and 3 do offer up several great episodes (""Gwen 10"" and ""Ben 10,000,"" to name but two).

By the way, from what I've read on Wikipedia, the Special Features will include several episode commentaries, interviews with the showmakers, a creator drawing lesson, and a collectible poster.

***********************************************************************

Here we go with the episodes:

""And Then There Were Ten"" (episode one) - On a summer cross-country trip via motorhome with his Grandpa Max and his disliked cousin Gwen, Ben Tennyson ends up with the powerful Omnitrix. But, intergalactic conqueror Vilgax is intent on gaining possession of the Omnitrix and sends his robots to get it.

""Washington B.C."" (episode two) - Ben goes up against Dr. Animo, a loony but brilliant scientist who created the Transmodulator, an invention which enlarges and distorts normal animals into gigantic, dangerous beasts.

""The Krakken"" (episode three) - While camping out and taking a swim in a lake, Ben bumps into a sea monster.

""Permanent Retirement"" (episode four) - In a homage to (or a blatant rip off of) INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, Ben, Max, and Gwen visit Aunt Vera's tiny town and discover that the residents are exhibiting very weird behavior.

""Hunted"" (episode five) - Vilgax sends three alien bounty hunters (Kraab, SixSix, and Hoverboard) after Ben's Omnitrix.

""Tourist Trap"" (episode six) - Feeling let down and bitterly bored with the tourist town of Sparksville and its main attraction of a giant ball of rubber bands, Max decides to play a prank but, instead, unleashes an electrical being called the Megawhatt.

""Kevin 11"" (episode seven) - Ben meets and hangs out with the psychotic, 11-year-old Kevin, who has the power to absorb energy. When Kevin learns of Ben's Omnitrix powers, he begins to absorb those.

""The Alliance"" (episode eight) - Ben goes up against an ornery female armored car robber who had been converted into a destructive alien cyborg named Rojo.

""Last Laugh"" (episode nine) - We find out that Ben is afraid of clowns, which sucks for him because the main baddie in this episode is an evil, parasitic clown named Zombozo.

""Lucky Girl"" (episode ten) - When Ben beats the wicked magician Hex, he takes from him a magical charm as a souvenir and offers it to Gwen. Gwen discovers that the charm has the power of incredible luck and becomes a superhero herself, called Lucky Girl. But, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and a prize must be paid for all of Gwen's fortuitousness...

""A Small Problem"" (episode eleven) - When there appears to be a glitch with the Omnitrix, Ben pounds the device in an attempt to activate it and ends up trapped in the form of the 5"" tall Grey Matter. An alien-obssessed man named Howell Wayneright captures him and presents him to the Organization, a clandestine group aiming to collect alien technology for its own purposes.

""Side Effects"" (episode twelve) - When Ben catches a cold, it has the side effect of weakening his powerful alter-egos; it's bad timing as he has to face off against an insect-controlling madman, who threatens the city with nuclear devastation.

""Secrets"" (episode thirteen) - It's the head alien, Vilgax himself, versus Ben 10. Plus, we get a first look at the underground facility beneath Mount Rushmore, which is the HQ of Grandpa Max's former covert and X-Files-like goverment organization.",1168128000,47,8073,5.077735849056603

2677197,5,B000JLTRF4,"I came across this series when it was on Netflix and was hooked.  As a fan of cartoons, I was blown away by how well crafted this series is, along with it's subsequent sequel series Alien Force and Ultimate Alien (not counting omniverse or the reboot series).

This series is very well written and constructed overall, as it taps into that essential element for young kids that dream of being superheroes, here is ben Tennyson getting that chance largely by accident.

I love how as the series progresses the mythology of the universe od this series builds and builds as we learn more about Grandpa max and his time as a 'plumber'.  Ans also see Ben still be your typical  10 year old but also learn about doing the right thing and about his responsibilities, even when he isn't  constantly bickering with his cousin Gwen.

That was one thingbthatnalways kinda bothered me watching many of these epusodes back to back , hearing the sniping  and bickering and gwen calling ben a dweeb a doofus a dork all the freaking time got really tiresome.  Im grateful that by the time Alien Force was made they made the characters older and pretty much had the antagonism between Ben and Gwen replaced with genuine familial affection.

Anyway, I loved how the people taht made this aeries were clearly comic book fans cu with the omnitrix and its abilities, it reminds one of tue Dial h for Hero, where the special dial allows the user to transform into different types of heroes for different types of situations.  I especially love how Ben tries to  go for  one alien hero and ends up with a different  one by mistake, which is funny but also Aids  in  teaching ben to think on his feet and make use of powers and abilities  at his disposal.  Also the fact that the omnitrix is green and even the symbol on the chest of each alien, and even the corps of plumbers being galactic defenders.and policemen, brings to  mind the green lantern Corps.

This first season sets the tone and also sets things in motion rather nicely.",1479340800,,2012,4.582633053221288

2677278,2,B000JLTRF4,"I'm sorry to the fans of this show, but I have to be honest. In my opinion, this is a big step backward to the genre of action superhero-themed show. Why do I say that? Because the last american anime superhero show I watched ""Teen Titans"" did so well with action, villains, color, character, and so forth! I would think I was finally opened to more shows like it, but no! Now it's ""Ben 10""! When I discovered this show, ""Teen Titans"" was not coming out with new episodes anymore, and I blamed this show for it. I later discovered that ""Teen Titans"" was partially from DC Comics and ""Ben 10"" was only from Cartoon Network, so with or without ""Ben 10"", ""Teen Titans"" had already ended. However, does that spare ""Ben 10"" from my disliking? No it doesn't! The idea of Ben turning to aliens within a device does not interest me, and when he does, the mutation is so gross! ""Teen Titans"" had a TON of characters, while this show only had three main characters, and even when there are more side characters, they are forgettable to me. Grandpa Max and Gwen are not interesting to me. There is no comedy in this show-no funny faces or jokes, just cousin rivalry between Ben and Gwen. They try, but it's no ""Raven and Beast Boy"" relationship. Also the idea that a whole series taking place within summer of THREE months is too crammed and ridiculous! Its next series ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" does a better job with settings and drama, and that show I find okay. Also, to be fair, some of the aliens Ben turns into are pretty cool, particularly the small gray one and that green and black one. There's also that Hex wizard villain, whom I found pretty cool, and I personally think should have been a ""Teen Titans"" villain. But aside from that, this show didn't do a thing for me. I know this show has a fan-base who like it and will buy this DVD as well as the other season DVDs, but I definetly won't be among them.",1365811200,,1903,4.363380281690141

2677331,5,B000JLTRF4,"It wasn't until the new show, Ben 10 Alien Force, debuted that I ever took an interest in Ben 10 at all. My nephews, 12 & 14 years of age, had told me about it before but I let it slide past me somehow. Basically what Ben 10 is about is Ben Tennyson, his cousin Gwen, and Grampa Max. Ben finds a bracelet called the Omnitrix. This bracelet allows him to assume the form of ten different aliens, each with different powers to use in any given situation. Sometimes; he changes into what he wants, while others times not. Then, after doing so, there's a time limit as to how long he can remain that way. Afterwards, the bracelets' power is drained for an unspecified amount of time before it can be used again. This puts Ben in a pickle, at times. In these first thirteen episodes, Ben & Company go up against the likes of Vilgax Dr. Animo, Kevin 11, and more. Vilgax is especially a pain in this first season as he wants the Omnitrix to conquer the galaxy. Being a comic book fan, the show itself reminds me of a DC comic called Dial H for Hero, in which one of the heroes dialed H-E-R-O on their watch to change them into a superhero. The series itself was created by Man of Action(a group consisting of Duncan Rouleau, Joe Casey, Joe Kelly, and Steven T. Seagle) and is voiced by Tara Strong(Teen Titans, The Batman), Dee Bradley Baker, Jim Ward, Meagan Smith, Paul Eiding, Richard McGonagle, Richard Steven Horvitz, Steven Jay Blum and Fred Tatasciore.

I honestly never thought I'd like this show but it's great. I'll admit, it might not have the same production values as, say, The Batman, Teen Titans or Justice League but it is just as entertaining and good.

If you're a big animation fan, check out Ben 10-The Complete Season One. You'll really like this show. I know I do.",1216080000,3,1780,4.423780487804878

Along with his grandpa and annoying cousing Gwen.  They battle whatever comes there way and Ben does his part in style and sometimes by accidentally switching to the wrong monster.

This show makes more sence as you watch it, plus, I think it's boring if you have one transformation like most shows have, this way one kid can become many things for different situations, and you learn why later.  It's like Teen Titans in a different way.

Now our ten-year-old boy must use his newfound powers to stop the bad guys and make a little mischief along the way as long as he doesn't get him into any trouble.

This two-disc DVD set chronicles his travels and adventures from the very beginning.  Besides the first thirteen episodes of the series, there's an audio commentary on the episode entitled ""Secrets"".  Also, even cooler, there's a how-to-draw featurette, interviews, and a sneak peek of a brand-new episode or two in the new season.  There's even a collectible poster included in this DVD set.
