8724530,5,B011KYC7OG,"This is a 3 set TV Movie box set from the comedian and writer David Walliams.  Each movie is cleverly written with a very fun theme.  The Boy in the Dress is about acceptance of differences that both affect family and friends on all levels.  It is very well put together and funny.  The school has strict dress codes and ironically the Principal who enforces the dress code likes to cross dress on his spare time.  Gangsta Granny takes a lonely boring grandmother and shows her other side, pilfering jewelry when no one is around, her grandson becomes very excited and not so bored as he becomes her accomplice.  Mr Stink also funny is another story of acceptance however it takes a man who was rich and makes him poor, but by his choice.  He befriends a young girl who wants to help, he doesn't want help and he doesn't want his stinky clothes laundered. Again all stories are cleverly written and very much enjoyable to watch.",1491868800,,928,4.520958083832335
