2849584,5,B000QXDJLI,"I almost hate to say this show is the best episodic drama series ever produced because it is so subjective and so difficult for any show to live up to such praise, but DAMMIT ""The Wire"" IS the best television drama I have ever seen.  Every season has been magnificent and Season 4 more than held its own with previous seasons.  I have never seen such consistently good writing, direction, and acting in a television program, whether it appeared on cable or broadcast t.v., and Season 4 of the show has a particularly powerful impact because of its unblinking focus on the sad and often doomed lives of so many of our children living in our inner-cities.  I cannot wait for this box set to come out so I can complete my Wire collection, and I am so looking forward to the start of Season 5 in January.",1189468800,3,800,4.391891891891892
2849585,5,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth season of HBO's critically acclaimed The Wire picks up after the explosive events the conclusion to the third season, as cop Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West) finds himself patroling the streets of Baltimore and seemingly out of the loop (McNulty is relegated to more of a supporting player in these episodes than ever before) as this season focuses on the coming election between Mayor Royce (Glynn Turman) and Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), and a group of young corner kids getting ready to go back to school.  What makes this season of The Wire so surprisingly compelling isn't the drama between the cops and the crooks like we've seen before, but what this group of young corner boys (Maestro Harrell, Julito McCullum, Tristan Wilds) experience and the choices they make, which not only effect their own lives, but inexplicably effect the lives of everyone else involved as well.  In the meantime, new kingpin Marlo (Jamie Hector) makes even more of an impact as the cops try to nail him, Herc (Domenick Lombardozzi) finally gets his stripes, Prez (Jim True-Frost) becomes a teacher, and Omar (Michael K. Williams) gets in over his head when he goes toe to toe with Marlo.  By the end of season four, it is apparent that the end is near, and that McNulty and his crew are sitting on a powder keg that will be as explosive as anything that has ever been seen on HBO.  Undoubtedly one of the finest and most realistic TV dramas ever crafted, The Wire is once again spectacular entertainment.",1189468800,95,1499,4.776061776061776
2849586,5,B000QXDJLI,"If you have seen The Wire in its previous three seasons and wondered whether this one measures up, the answer is ""absolutely yes"".  If you haven't seen the show at all, what are you waiting for?

Previously I would've said season 2 was my favorite, but I think this one surpassed it.  It is astonishing to me that the show gets better and better.  We continue to see deeper facets of characters we are familiar with, and we get a group of new ones that become vividly etched in our consciousness very quickly.  Pat Moran Casting in Baltimore deserves an award for consistently finding strong actors for the show, including for this season, a good-sized group of early teens and younger.

""The Wire"" IS the great American novel that so many have talked about writing ""some day"".  David Simon and his fellow scribes were driven to paint a realistic gritty portrait about life in a contemporary American industrial city and we have all reaped the rewards.",1189382400,30,952,4.698795180722891
2849587,5,B000QXDJLI,"I agree in sentiment with the people below me in that The Wire is incredible and I understand that they want to talk to someone about what happens in it.

Please don't give a synopsis of what happens - this isn't what the review system here is for.

I recognise my hypocrisy as I'm not using it for it's intended use either but please don't come here to account for the events of Season 4 when people who haven't bought it may be coming here to purchase it.

Cheers.",1187136000,6,466,4.213483146067416
2849588,5,B000QXDJLI,"The story so far... (Don't read any further if you don't want to know any detail of what happens in this Season of the show).

On street level, Stringer Bell is dead, Avon Barksdale is back behind bars and the cold and wilful Marlo Stansfield (played by Jamie Hector) looks like he's squaring up to be crowned king. Preston ""Bodie"" Broadus (played by JD Williams) is the only true Barksdale soldier still holding it down but finds it's a whole new game with a whole new set of rules. Meanwhile, the drug dealers' nightmare that is Omar (played by Michael K Williams) has a new protg in tow and he's as busy as ever. The scene when he and Marlo finally come face to face is pure TV heaven.

On law level, political involvement in the Major Crimes Unit sends its best personnel off in all different directions: Lieutenant Daniels (played by Lance Reddick) gets promoted out, Detectives Kima Greggs (played by Sonja Sohn) and Lester Freamon (played by Clarke Peters) are squeezed out - and back to Homicide - and Detective Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) realises he's running the risk of losing his soul and goes back on patrol. He also gives up the booze and tries to become a family man. The end result of all this is that no one is really up on the wire and by the time the incredible number of bodies being stacked up in vacant houses by Marlo's two lieutenants Chris and Snoop (played by Gbenga Akinnagbe and Felicia Pearson) come to light, there are so many of them, the task of solving the crimes seem pretty much unsurmountable to the shocked law enforcement personnel.

On City Hall level, Councilman Tommy Carcetti (played by Aiden Gillen) does the unimaginable and wins the mayoral elections in Baltimore but finds it might be the beginning of his battles rather than the end.

And if all that were not enough, in the middle school system, the 'No Child Left Behind' programme is shown up for what it really is, while 8th graders - some, like Michael (played by Tristan Wilds) and Dukie (played by Jermaine Hawkins) with drug addicted parents; some, like Namond Brice (played by Julito McCullum) with drug dealing parents - dad Wee-Bey (played by Hassan Johnson) is in prison and mother De'Londa (played by Sandi McCree) wants her little boy to grow up and be just like his daddy - and tragically, some with no parents at all - Randy (played by Maestro Harrell) is in foster care and Sherrod (played by Rashad Orange) is taken under wing by Bubbles (played by Andre Royo) of all people - are left to their own devices and to the lure of the streets. Some of the younger kids like the streetwise and smart-mouthed Kenard (played by Thuliso Dingwall) and the car-stealing, joy-riding Donut, so small he can barely see over the steering wheels of the cars he jacks (played by Nathan Corbett), we don't get to see their parents at all. Ever.

And this is not even the half of it. The scene is thus set for the fourth season of this incredibly articulate HBO series and on many levels, primarily due to the focus of school-age children, it might prove to be the most explosive season of all. With its awesome ensemble cast, ""The Wire"" continues to draw the highest praise from the most unexpected of quarters all over the world. Don't miss this. And don't let the complex storylines, unglamorous settings or gritty (and often violent) scenes and colourful language put you off. It's like watching real life or reading a novel. In the real world, situations do not usually get resolved within 50 minutes, just as they don't get tied up neatly within a chapter of a book. It was appointment TV for me on the FX channel earlier this year and I so cannot wait for the DVD. This is without a doubt, the best thing on TV.

PS. I've deliberately refrained from using the B word because I've come to understand that it upsets certain people and I totally understand why.

We could be missing the point though, with the utmost respect. The stories that are being told here - and they are just stories by the way; ""The Wire"" is not a documentary series or even a docudrama - could be told from Washington DC, Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit or any major US city and still be just as authentic, and just as believable. I don't believe The Wire is a statement about a particular city. I think the creators and writers have just gone with the location they know - and love, it has to be said.

I don't feel it's a statement about America either, particularly. Drug addiction, drug wars (the so-called wars being fought against drugs and the wars the drug dealers are contantly fighting amongst themselves), the proliferation of guns in our communities, political corruption and, (as is highlighted in this particular season), deficient child educational systems in particular and the way children are collectively being failed by the very society that is supposed to protect and nurture them in general, are all evident all over the world if we know where to look.

IMO, these are stories about human nature and the different ways in which man's actions affect the world we live in. That's what makes ""The Wire"" so fascinating.",1182384000,130,5135,4.62788144895719
2849589,5,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth season of The Wire can easily hold its own against the first and third seasons.  I thought it was very good and was hooked on it since the first episode, I can not wait until it is released on dvd.",1180310400,15,208,3.9523809523809526
2849670,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is simply one of the best TV series ever.  Maybe even the best. I'm especially partial to Season 4 because it deals with our kids and our education system.  We see these 4 boys' school experience, home experience, and street experience.  We see the way that they're supported and failed by the adults in their lives.  These boys make some good and bad choices; but alot of choices and decisions are made for them--sometimes by adults who themselves were failed when they were young.  I was especially moved by the character Duquan.  What chance does this kid have to grow?  I mean, someone helps him out here and there.  But no one really looks out for him.  These kids are just screwed by the system, although there are some adults who intervene to try to help.  Naimond gets a really lucky break.  Each boy in The Wire Season 4 has a story, and you understand the kind of adult he'll probably turn out to be based on the traumas and triumphs of his childhood.  Season 4 is just simply brilliant.  The entire series is stellar.",1507334400,2,1037,4.481283422459893

2849674,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is a gritty and gripping detective drama, which is widely considered to be one of the all-time best shows in this genre, as well as being one of the greatest television programs ever made. It was created and primarily written by David Simon, the renowned author and former crime reporter, who, because of his background, was able to impart an uncanny sense of realism to the series. The Wire was set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, and its story line centers around the organization and function of the criminal drug trade in Baltimore, and the tragic way in which it has ravaged the city, and its beleaguered residents. The Wire consists of a total of sixty episodes, spanning five seasons, with a different emphasis for each season. Although the multifaceted drug trade represents the overarching focus of this series, each individual season assesses the manner in which this criminal enterprise impacts a specific operational area of the city of Baltimore. The first season of The Wire examines the drug trade itself, the second season deals with the dysfunctional seaport system, the third season analyzes the corrupt city government and bureaucracy, the fourth season addresses the deteriorating school system, and the fifth and final season evaluates the unethical print news media. It brutally and realistically depicts the devastating effects that the criminal narcotic trade has had on the residents of inner city Baltimore, whose lives have been destroyed by the pervasive drug-related misery, despair, and hopelessness, which have now become endemic in this population. The Wire is characterized by insightful and brilliant writing, superb plot and character development, and absolutely spectacular acting performances, by its exceedingly talented ensemble cast. It definitely deserves the numerous awards and accolades which it has received over its five-year run. The Wire is a truly outstanding television series, which is riveting, moving, and emotional, and it merits an unequivocal five-star rating, along with a very strong recommendation.",1499212800,5,2071,5.414860681114551

2849956,5,B000QXDJLI,"This series came out in the 2002 - 2008 years. Seem to recall it got a number of awards for its depiction of the drugs, unions, police and politics in the City of Baltimore. But probably not much difference in our other large cities.

It's a mess and has been a mess in our cities for a long time. Will it ever get better? Not certain it will-its too engrained into the day-to-day as shown in this series.

You watch this and then pick up the news and you see it happening as this show showcased it years ago.  If our new President can break this cycle up starting in Chicago and be successful, it will change these cities and the people who live in them and give them some hope.

The show depicts the lives impacted by this crummy environment they have to live in. A great show to binge watch and watch again every few years as I did.

What has been done in the past has not worked and The Wire shows this with characters, some who carry over from season to season. You see it with the drug dealers, the cops who in some cases get tainted by bending the rules to stay alive and to make progress, to local politician whose goals are "" to look good"" for their next election.

Yep its a mess, but maybe-just maybe there is a small sliver of hope. Lots of violence, profanity, occaisional nudity so a adult only show. But it is a really good show.",1485388800,,1344,4.189922480620155

2850281,5,B000QXDJLI,"Good series. At first I did not like it, as it was a bit confusing, but the longer I watched, the more enthralled I became.  I had to use the captions because I could not understand what the characters were saying.  I know this is ""just"" a movie/TV series  -- meaning, it is Hollywood, not necessarily ""REAL"" life -- but I found the cultural perspective very thought provoking.  I came away understanding a bit more of the utter hopelessness that the ""inner-city"" inhabitants are exposed to --- I had a friend tell me I was ""White Privileged"".  I have been chewing on that for weeks now. My gut reaction was -- ""heh, I worked hard to get where I am, my parents worked hard to provide my education, etc.""...but it is deeper than that. I am still processing that label, along with how  the characters in the series were portrayed.  I feel there is much work to be done to make things better.  But, as far as the series goes, well worth the watch.  I am hoping the level of corruption in the police department and the city government is just a Hollywood portrayal -- I pray that is not the case in real life.  If so, we really have some work to do and people need to own this.",1482624000,,1173,4.290909090909091

2850406,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is the best show ever created for television. Season four is likely the best season of the show.
The corner boys theme shows us another public institution (schools)  that has surrendered to bureaucratic pressure and is juking the stats and pushing kids through the system, not with malice, but with frustration. Teachers take solace in small victories while losing the overall war.
The election reveals another side of a corrupt system and an ""ends justify the means"" mentality.
So, so much more. The rise of Marlo, Cutty's continuing redemption story, Chris and Snoop (the nail gun scene is classic), Omar, Bubbles, Dukie, Michael. So much great stuff packed in one season. You have to watch The Wire altogether, though. A friend described it as a tapestry that only really makes sense when viewed as a completed work of art.",1481846400,,835,4.921985815602837

2850877,5,B000QXDJLI,"I thought the series could have ended here, although I would also have liked it to go on . . . theoretically . . . forever.  I think the series was best when it focused on the people in the street . . . drug dealers, cops, teachers and the kids that have to grow up among the relentless and unnecessary chronic tragedy of our inner cities.  The funny thing about the concept of ""chronic"" and ""tragedy"" is that when something is ""chronic"" we get used to it and it doesn't seem like a tragedy anymore.  The Wire makes it clear that there is such a thing as a ""chronic tragedy.""  Yet it does this with objectivity, compassion and humor.  Interesting that the truth is actually more entertaining than the canned stuff.  (By the way I work on death penalty cases investigating the social history of the accused, and this series is right on the money, if a bit more grandiose for the sake of art.) This season is as good as it gets on TV.  Keep in mind that I already watched the whole season when it first aired.  This is like rereading a favorite book and realizing once again how great it was, and how it will probably never come again.",1477699200,,1133,4.286384976525822

2850965,5,B000QXDJLI,"It as amazing. I didn't see this series when it first aired almost 10 years ago but, boy oh boy, I'm glad I finally got a chance to see it. It's not just another story about people living in the hood. This series was so well done. It required a lot of research on the part of the writers to capture, not just the plight of a community engulfed in the drug trade but, the politics surrounding it and the fact that the drug trade is truly a trickle up economy. People you'd least expect relied on the income from the sales just to make ends meet and hold failing industries together.

The acting was also superb. I credit the acting as the reason that it was so easy to get immersed in the storyline.  I didn't feel as though there was a single character that didn't belong. You got to know them, care about them, anticipate their demise, or rally in their corner. Above all, this show touched on the reasons that people in the inner cities live the way they do. They have been excluded from the progress that went on around them for so long that in many cases they don't know how to change the direction of their lives. It was powerful.",1477180800,,1135,4.25

2851337,3,B000QXDJLI,"Recently my wife and I started with the first episode of season one. Watching one or two episodes a night we've managed to completely view season one-three and are well into season four. Season four is good, but does not compare to the earlier seasons. The show is called ""The Wire"" not how to solve all the problems of the inter-city. The political aspects of all seasons is discouraging. From the crooked major to the in-component police chief down to the dumb head daily patrol officers. Its like a few good guys are rowing upstream against all the obstacles being placed in front of them. This situation likely is mirrored through all the federal agencies. Look how tainted the FBI has become.",1474329600,,697,4.721311475409836

2851343,5,B000QXDJLI,"I love this program. Only have one season remaining, and I will be watching an episode here, and there, trying to make it last a little longer. Season 4 spends a lot of time concentrating on the kids that grow up in a horrible environment. It depicts the problems, and challenges the kids face, as well as the school system, and adults that try to teach, and mentor the kids. This a TV program, and not a documentary, but the question is, how far from reality is this depiction?",1474243200,,478,4.382022471910112

2851348,2,B000QXDJLI,"It's marginal at best. I am watching them all as I made it this far so I might as well watch them all. But if you were new to The Wire I'd say stop after season 1 and go find something else to watch.

Seasons 2 - The worst of them all so far. But S4 is looking like a tie w S2
Season 3 - I can not recall what happened.
Season 4  - Great if you need a brush up on bratty kids dropping F bomb every 5 minutes.",1474243200,,408,3.4725274725274726

2851514,5,B000QXDJLI,"Best television show ever and whatever is second isn't all that close. Season 4 focuses on the school system and is an extremely realistic portrayal of inner city kids; outstanding production, acting is all first class, editing and pacing are a genuine pleasure to watch. I have seen all five seasons now several times and it just gets better every time. Story lines are so complex that it requires multiple viewings to catch everything that's going on. Breaking Bad is very well done; this is in a class by itself.",1472774400,,515,4.733333333333333
2851515,3,B000QXDJLI,"Seasons 1 & 2 were the best. I really came to care for and feel frustrated by the situation the characters are put in and their weak attempts to escape those situations. I could have done without some of the graphic sex scenes that are totally unnecessary and didn't forward the story. I was glad that this fell to the wayside by season 3 and 4 however, these seasons were slow for me and fell into too much tedium for the average viewer. I realize they were showing the frustrations of the school system and they really did bring home the red tape and inefficient bureaucracy for me with the slow story line. I felt like I was living it minute by minute rather than watching a tv show. Season five picks back up and ends on a better note with several characters seeming to have a brighter futures. However, you get the sense that this is a never-ending system of flaws because the components that made it work originally have failed. Truth, honor, justice, reputation, ethics, morality...neither neighborhoods, schools or the justice system can work without these human characteristics and traits.  much anymore. This isn't about poverty or just a simple lack of opportunity because people were poor in the 1920's and they did not commit these kinds of ruthless crimes against each other.

We have stopped teaching and training up young people in the way they should go.",1472774400,,1371,4.708333333333333

2851518,4,B000QXDJLI,"This series develops a story and characters that are both believable.  They may be far from fact, or not, but seem realistic.  Assuming that near truth is the case, it is very scary to think that these things can actually take place.  It certainly underlines that Democratic Party control has been a complete societal failure.  The real shame is that the victims keep drinking the liberal progressive cool aid.  Repeatedly doing the same thing while expecting a different result - definition of pure insanity.",1472774400,,509,5.011904761904762

2851578,5,B000QXDJLI,"Although I still feel that Season Two, which brought in waterfront corruption, is the strongest edition of the show, Season Four is also quite strong. I must say, however, that I've never felt Aidan Guillen was the best choice for the role of mayor of Baltimore. He doesn't possess the gravitas that I associate with someone in that position. The detour to the school system is well done. The season ending finale, while superbly written, comes off as a bit too predictable.

I see some of these actors in other roles that you barely recognize because they have immersed themselves so much in the parts they are playing. AND, HBO didn't get really heavy-handed on the sex/nudity. There have been a couple of times where it's been too much, but not like in Game of Thrones or some other HBO stuff.

2851710,4,B000QXDJLI,The Wire it interesting and compelling in every possible way. I almost took a day of work off to enjoy two fantastic episodes in the first season. Your time will be well spent becoming absorbed in a great dramatic series that can often take me on a roller coaster ride as multiple events are happening simultaneously.

2851997,5,B000QXDJLI,Some people have refused to watch this series because of all the unnecessary porn and foul language in seasons 1 and 2.  Finally in seasons 3 thru 5 the writers realized their talents at story telling and laid off the displays of sexual perversions.  Characters become able to say whole sentences free of the F word.  Great writing and great presentation of the story by the actors.,1465516800,,382,4.6716417910447765

Each season has its own set of twists as the characters and players move between roles. Not as epic as Breaking Bad and Mad Men, but its in that league. Some of the it is slow moving but its also something you can watch without having to pay constant attention without losing the thread of what is going on.  Good TV if you are trying to multitask.

2852126,4,B000QXDJLI,"I have rarely given a book or show a ""5"", and almost did here. I definitely would have given it a 41/2 if it was an option. When I started watching ""The Wire"" I was a bit taken aback by how raw it is. But I think it in fact gives a frank presentation of the reality of the drug infused racial culture of Baltimore in the early part of this century. The first three seasons focused on the police and the drug dealers, with the exception of one season that concentrated on a longshoreman's union. During these prior seasons the viewer was made aware of the terrible environment where the African Americans lived, and the incredible efforts needed to escape such a place. Season 4 goes much deeper into this cultural deprivation that the young black men are faced with, and how it can overcome the best efforts of both the children and those who sincerely want to help them.  Season 4 traces four specific youngsters who are trying to be better that their surroundings, their peers, and, in most cases, their parents. It is a sad and gripping story that is presented in a compelling fashion. To me, this is the series at its very best-perhaps TV at its very best.",1464048000,,1160,4.446009389671362

I really enjoyed  the series and I wish there was a season 6. I am into the last season now and wish I had another to look forward too. The show itself is shocking but reality of the program makes you really think about politics and how corrupt things are. The violence is sometimes hard to watch but in real life that stuff happens every where. Even in my own backyard. I know the writer is not interested in doing another season. But I really think many people would want to see Mcnulty, Lester , Bunk and the gang together again.

2852186,5,B000QXDJLI,"I just finished season 4 of The Wire.  The story arc and writing is even better than previous seasons.  We follow 4 friends in West Baltimore who's lives are each touched by the drug trade. Beginning with the waning  days of summer vacation, we progress through the school year with them.  Finally we have someone to care  about, we fear for them, hope for them, even cry for, as well as with them. The power of the street life threatens them daily, yet there is always an instance of concern and filial love to assist for at least one day.
We have a ranking police officer who finds a way to curb the violence and fear of the citizen of West Baltimore, only to be struck down by the blindness and heavy hand of outdated criminal and drug codes.  How many good men and women have faced this situation in real life.
Finally, there are the politicians, crafty and cunning, for whom do they work, themselves or the citizenry. A great show, The Wire.",1463184000,,946,4.408045977011494

2852254,4,B000QXDJLI,"Great plot, always want to know what happens next. My only problem with the show, which I get, is that it doesn't really show just how ruthless gang life is. If you'be seen documentaries or ""the first 48 hours"" or used to cop in the hood or live in it, you realize the grit is glossed over to an extent. But you let that go cause it's a TV show with a compelling story line that tells several stories that need to be told. I don't have any experience with serving in politics but i'my sure it misses some marks there too getting into corruption and the insurance and outs. Basically, it paints a beautiful picture of many aspects of big in error city workings, but it's painted with a broad stroke if you get my meaning.",1462406400,,720,4.262773722627737

2852275,4,B000QXDJLI,"This show is by far one of the best shows ever produced for television.  The acting was superb.  The plotlines and sub plotlines and the flow of those many parts into one great, sensible whole was exciting to watch.  I was one of those who watched all five seasons on my Amazon Prime, and the drama and story lines had me so caught up that I watched at least three a day (for a guy who watches only four hours a week, that is WAY more than usual).  So you can say I was really amazed by the great story telling.

Now, one may ask, why four stars then?  Well, it is because almost everyone on the show was an amoral, immoral, filthy mouthed, sexually perverted person.  Almost EVERYONE!  I mean,  couldn't there be at least one out of five people within the plot that was at least a decent guy who didn't throw out F bombs all the time or revel in porn mags?  Isn't there at least ONE out of ten who didn't drink to get drunk?  McNulty's new girlfriend, Beadie (and McNulty himself for Season Four) was somewhat decent.  But it seemed like David Simon was born and raised only with crossing the ethical line thugs or something.  Because they were all pretty vile people.",1461974400,,1169,4.307339449541284

As whole the revelations, downfalls, and inspiring events never really hit like they should, just too much going on, and sadly in it's quest to be authentic those moments are all pretty small in the eyes of the characters anyway so the story doesn't give them much more screen time Vs any of the other minor events happening on a seemingly constant rate.",1455580800,,651,4.572649572649572

2852699,5,B000QXDJLI,Brilliant season!  It is the best of the five seasons.  The story breaks away from the police procedural and delves into the lives of four middle school students in the projects.  Such a profound and heartbreaking look into a world few of us know.  The acting is so unreal that it feels like one is watching a documentary.,1455580800,,322,4.5

2852703,3,B000QXDJLI,"The 4th season is where The Wire kind of drops the ball.  Getting into the lives of teenagers lowers the tone, partly because of poor acting, partly because the kid they push to the front of the story (the Naymond Bryce character) is an insufferable little punk played by an actor with no discernible talent.

  Season 1 had some teenagers who could actually act, playing characters essential to the storyline.  Season 4 has a whole subcast of untalented actors whose characters don't even advance the storyline.  It looks like some bad wroters wrote in terrible characters and a bad casting director was hired to fill roles with miserably untalented kids that get in the way of the story.  The characters from earlier seasons who were already over the top as ""larger than life"" become a little less credible, as well.

  It's unforgivable, also, that the writers show the killers' nail gun as a nearly silent tool, when a powder actuated Hilti is as loud as any pistol.  Why this tool is written into the script as a character is a mystery.  The killers already had  battery powered nail gun that would be as quiet as they wanted us to believe the Hilti was.

  The story also veers off into the lives of the politicians, and those characters are even less interesting than the teenagers.  None of the actors playing the roles of politicians are good at the job of acting.  Still, the story keeps us hooked, and the characters who made us care about the city and the people manage to carry this season well enough to get fans through.

 The acting is terrible in some instances.  The actors who pay the following roles: Marla Daniels, Clay Davis, Kima Greggs and Naymond Bryce are every bit as awful as the characters they portray.  Casting these actors in anything is a mistake.  None of them would have been acceptable in anything other than one line walk on parts.

  One other problem with this series is that the subtitles, always poorly done, are even less accurate in season 4 than they were in the first three seasons.  In season 4, the subtitles seem to be written by people who haven't read the script and depend on their tin ears to fill in for the hearing impaired.  Slim Charles tell Bodie that ""Nary a Barksdale is left"" and the tin eared subtitle writers translate that into ""Mayor Barksdale is left"".  This kind of thing goes on in every episode.

  The 4th season is the weakest in terms of storyline and acting ability.  Suffer through it and things get a little better in the final season.",1455235200,,2509,4.604072398190045

2852712,5,B000QXDJLI,"Another excellent season of The Wire. This season takes a closer look at how the whole drug/crime scene starts in a person. More specifically, how young they are when they start living the street life. A very real take on how they act in school and interact with each other and their teachers. The storyline of Marlo is still moving along and his two cronies are very easy to hate. You learn a little more about one of them but in the end you're really only hoping for one result for the both of them. We also get a look into the struggles of the mayor and city council and the political games he must play to keep the city running.

If I had to find one thing I didn't like in this season it has to be the lack of Dominic West on the screen. Although it makes sense because his storyline came to a halt, I always enjoy seeing him on the screen as he tends to make every scene he is in better in some way.

Looking forward to season 5 and finishing one of the best series I have ever seen.",1455062400,,989,4.066666666666666

This season was a complete triumph of storytelling. We see the outcome of the politics of Season 3 come to fruition and get introduced into how education plays a role in the lives of Baltimore's citizens. Seeing how everything is interconnected and how the butterfly effect comes into place is so completely well done. We get introduced to new characters -- the very opening scene of the season with Snoop buying a new nail gun is fantastic; and say goodbye to others that had been around since day one.

2852784,5,B000QXDJLI,"Season 4 of The Wire centers on the election and subsequent win to the mayor's office by Tommy Carcetti and Marlo Stanfield, the new player on the block.

With a huge reduction in force for the Major Crimes Unit, everybody has bailed out with the exception of two lonely detectives, Herc - having just made Sgt after working two months in the mayor's office under Royce, and Dozerman who have been instructed by their new Major, Marimow, to ""rip and run"".  No long term work, just street rips.

With political jockeying going up the chain to the mayor's office, everything looks to be shaken up.  However, Marlo remains a problem.  Nobody moves up and expands without dropping bodies and the bodies aren't being found.  Until... Randy Wagstaff, well played by Maestro Harrell, spills the beans to the vice principal of his school.

It is hard watching these ""children"".  Knowing the inner city world as I once did, it hurts to see innocence stripped away at such a young age.  Kids who should be enjoying comic books, riding bikes and generally goofing around are either carrying the weight of their family or on the street slinging.",1454457600,2,1133,4.769230769230769

2852828,5,B000QXDJLI,"I love the show and have enjoyed each season bringing us a different focus in the life of the city. The main focus in season four is the schools. There is a specific focus on a group of middle schoolers as Prez begins his career as a teacher, and Bunny works with some sociologists on a research project that seems to really help some of the corner kids. We also see how testing doesn't really serve that population very well, and yet the teachers and the school admin are under enormous pressure to conform. And the newly elected mayor's good intentions come into conflict with his political ambitions, and the schools suffer, as do our friends in Major Crimes.
The focus on this kids was heartbreaking. I kept thinking that one of those boys could have been Freddie Gray.",1454198400,,773,4.568345323741007

2852969,5,B000QXDJLI,"""The Wire"" is and has been one of the best series ever. It's in my opinion it was over shadowed by infierior shows during its time. As a result it never received the public recognition it deserved. However, the true fans of the show have done an excellent job speaking it's praises. I also charge the creator and producers of this ground breaking show to continue the story line in spite of the voiced statement by its creator to never write about this story again, until the government make a choice to actively fight the corruption that perpetuates this terrible circle.",1449187200,,572,4.673267326732673

2853002,5,B000QXDJLI,"This is the best season of ""The Wire"" yet and when we consider that the first three seasons are so good, it speaks highly of the quality of the series. This time, we move away a little from the crime drama that was the tone of the first three seasons to a focus on politics and education. The picture painted by the show runners is absolutely devastating but it also feels real and compelling. There is still plenty of drama and many of the beloved characters are back, but most in diminished roles. The city becomes the main star of the show and that makes season four fantastically mesmerizing.",1449014400,,596,4.477064220183486

It's actually the most difficult season to watch as you follow these innocent kids who get caught in a web that they can't escape and wind up having to fend for themselves.  I enjoyed seasons 1-3 and watching McNulty in his various states of drunken debauchery.  But McNulty is barely a part of S4 and all of the levity is from the kids talking and joking with each other.  The young cast is excellent.  I have to say, I was disappointed that S5 abandoned the youth of S4 for the fuddy duddiness of the newsroom.",1448236800,,625,4.262711864406779

An aberration because even when compared to other shows that are often heralded as ""great"", the case can be made that The Wire: Season 4 leaves the competition behind.  Quite simply, this is one of the best seasons of television ever produced in history.  And while one might typically caution against over-hyping so as not to set a degree of expectation for the uninitiated that can never be met, it seems unlikely that the typical rules apply here.

Every detail of this season sparkles.  Even with principle character Det. Jimmy McNulty taking a noticeable back seat to the rest of the cast, the characters and story lines that come to the forefront are so engaging, so compelling, that the viewer feels a sense of urgency for resolution each time the show cuts away to a different story line, only to have that feeling immediately return as they invariably get sucked into the next plot point.

The adolescent characters are beautifully written, and portrayed with remarkable nuance by a young cast.  David Simon, Ed Burns and the rest of the writing staff are careful to prevent any of them from becoming one-note, or falling into stereotypes.  As per the show's M.O., viewers will find themselves growing attached in different ways to each of the new characters, while familiar faces from seasons past continue to evolve and show us new sides to their personalities.

The Wire Season 4 is to television what A Christmas Carol is to literature.  It is often profound, sometimes shocking, and will leave you questioning our nation's inextricable marriage of politics, the criminal justice system, and our misguided public education curriculum.

Highest possible recommendation.",1447286400,11,1856,4.9935064935064934

2853112,5,B000QXDJLI,"Like the previous seasons, the show takes a few episodes to set up the new characters, plots and relationships. This show never comes out swinging, but rather carefully crafts the trajectory of new themes while continuing previous threads established in previous episodes.

Season 4 strikes at the heart of the problems of gang life in that it establishes the how when and where it begins with young black youth. It also shows how political and financial systems continue to feed the problems of inner city poverty  as well as benefitting  from the problems of inner city gangs and drug culture...

  But in season 4 there is also a strong thread of hope; A newly elected mayor who genuinely wants to go good, a retired police commander who decides to work with youth, an ex-cop turned teacher, and a former gang soldier/ex/felon among others are out to make a difference... And at the halfway mark of season 4 things are looking up...

Like the previous seasons of wired, this series is some of the best written, filmed, acted and directed television there is.

The gritty realism of the show continues to ring very true to me during season 4: I grew up on the south side of Cgucsgo on the fringes of minority youth crime and drugs. There are few, if any, ""Hollywood endings"" in this series.

  And though sometimes that's hard to swallow, I feel it's important that the show doesn't seem to let its viewers off of the emotional hook. Life is very, very hard at the bottom of our society's ladder simply because there are few if any easy choices for inner city youth surrounded mostly by hopelessness. And it's not that their lives are hard, but it's pointlessly un-necessarily hard. This show dramatizes that with no excuses and apparently without making any moral judgements about their plight.",1446422400,,1797,4.764516129032258

I guess this is the price we pay for verisimilitude -- no PC in this series. Try it, you may be shocked, but you won't be disappointed.

2853172,3,B000QXDJLI,Probably the most disappointing of all seasons so far.  West's performance as McNulty and Elba's Stringer Bell are absent and most will miss them.  Also largely gone is the relationship between Mcnulty and Bunk which drives the humor of the first seasons.  The show is no longer driven by Mcnulty and the show's entertainment value drops pretty severely.  The writing is still supreme and the performances are brilliant but somehow the tension of chasing Stringer Bell made the show compelling and losing that plot line diminished my passion for the season.

Do I care about many of the characters? Yes. But as I continue with the series I keep asking myself what the big deal is. I have felt much more interested in many other programs (like BBC's Broadchurch, Season 1 for example). I found that the complexity of the characters dropped dramatically after Season 1 - and for the most part, ""good guys and bad guys"" roles fell back into the usual, predictable categories. Season 2 was useless, Season 3 revived some interest, and this, Season 4, had more powerful moments than the previous two, but still didn't seem to move the series forward in any particularly interesting or surprising ways. I've grown indifferent to the show and didn't want to bother with Season 5, but they left enough untied that I might go ahead for the sake of closure.

Showing that the collateral damage  spreads through all classes and sectors of our society. It's reported that Obama thinks highly of this series would that he had the resources and back bone to act accordingly. Mir. Simon gets that the Drug War must end !.

2853422,5,B000QXDJLI,"This is a hard hitting cops & drug dealers drama, but it's way beyond anything I've ever seen.  These scripts take one inside the Baltimore police with its power struggles, politics, incompetence, and yes heroic efforts to save a few souls along the way on a day to day job that often is incredibly boring not to mention full of bureaucratic bulls***.  And this is played out against the inner city drug gang with its own competition and corruption and deal making not to mention the toll taken on kids who seldom find a way out of this culture to a better life.  The acting is superb within stories that constantly twist, turn and bring surprises.  Many a night I turn off the TV saying, ""Jesus, was that ever dark,"" and still I go back to this deeply moving, complex and challenging series.  I've got one more year of this show to look forward to, and wish it would never end.",1440374400,,878,4.428571428571429

2853425,3,B000QXDJLI,"Slow-moving, but remains fairly interesting. There are episodes, during which, I started thinking ""Is this episode actually relevant?"" For the most part, it's still worth watching if you've made it this far. If season three was boring for you, then this one may not be worth your time. Marlo is not a formidable point of conflict but the city itself becomes the main focus, and that is very interestingI just think they could have spent more time actually focusing on that to make it a little more evident. Michael K. Williams is a phenomenal actorOmar Little is the most interesting character in this series, IMHOHe was great in Boardwalk Empire as well... I can't wait to see what he does next!

As someone who has worked with ""inner-city"" kids (a title I don't particularly care for) I will say that they got the attitudes pretty spot ona little over the topbut it's a drama, y'all! What they over-simplified a little is being able to reach those children; it's not impossible, but it's very difficult. I do appreciate the way teachers are portrayed: not too loving, but tough-loving, and very serious about jumping through the bureaucratic hoops to serve their students well. I no longer work with kidshonestly, I couldn't handle it. Hug a teacher, folksthey deserve it! Actually, to Hell with a hug! Go volunteer, it's important!

2853429,5,B000QXDJLI,season 1 and 4 were by far my favorite.  Season 4 did a great job of developing the stories of the young characters which gave them dimension and helped understand the drug culture when it takes over a neighborhood.,1440374400,,215,4.512820512820513

2853431,5,B000QXDJLI,"Well not sure what to say at this point. At season 4 everyone probably knows that this is an amazing show. I'll mention a few of the major plot points which are a bit different like in seasons past. First you see the race for mayor and then the political challenges after the election. The corner kids as they are called are a main focus as well with their lives on the streets and in the classroom. Also Marlo is the main guy on the streets right now so you get to see about his crew and the police after him as well.

My only complaint is that McNulty is hardly in this season. Obviously a main character in past seasons and someone I like allot. The season ends with what looks like him being set up to be in the main action again though. Although this is a bit of a criticism I have on the show, its still amazing as always. I really enjoyed the race for mayor and even more light on the political scene. This show really opens your eyes on how things really are in many aspects out there.

2853452,3,B000QXDJLI,Season 4 was hard to accept because most of the characters from seasons 1 through 3 were gone.  This was disappointing.  McNulty's character was degraded.  This was disappointing.  Marlo came out of an unexplained existence.  This didn't make sense.  Marlo's character was flat yet the story centered around his existence.  The investigative team was split up and their roles weakened.  The business with all the investments from Barkdsdale and Stringer went unexplained.

The Wire is maybe the finest written and produced television drama I've ever seen. This is as realistic a crime drama as you are going to get, and, sadly, the realism is all too true for the streets of West Baltimore still.  The Wire's inside look at the interconnectivity between the drug gangs, the police, the politicians, and the local media is almost like being there 24/7.

This season was an allusion to the truth about how our country has no longer continued to reach out to the lower class of the ladder to help them out of their blight.

The series takes place in Baltimore, so the recent events in that city add to the interest in this series.  Essentially, it's about the city police detectives and their trials and tribulations with the drug trade and other crimes, and also with the city government.  But also the personal lives of the young blacks brought up in that world of drug dealing, and the attempts to try and help them.  I highly recommend this series.",1434931200,,527,4.695652173913044

This season we are introduced to group of middle school aged students, some of who work the corners in Baltimore's inner city, some who are trying to find a way out of the drug scene. The ensemble work by this group of young actors is outstanding. They are Jermaine Crawford, Maestro Harrell, Julito McCullum and Tristan Wilds. Also deserving special mention are two who were on the law and order side in previous seasons: Jim True-Frost, as a detective turned math teacher and Robert Wisdom as a former Major turned counselor/mentor working with the most incorrigible students. This season had a lot of heart and also broke some hearts as events seemed to have a way of ensnaring these young men. Once you start this season you'll want to watch it through to the end.",1433808000,,835,4.726027397260274
2853787,4,B000QXDJLI,"Great season with great characters. Although I did miss some of the drug underworld stuff, its replaced with a very realistic look into how the lives children are affected by poverty. Its probably the most depressing season but it also has the most potential to affect viewers. All too many times, children in these circumstances are looked upon as a statistic and honestly most of America has no idea how disconnected this type of environment is from the ""American Dream."" This is the type of piece I would consider being required for some type of humanities class. You can't see this and then make throw-a-way statements about impoverished people somehow just working hard enough to get out of the cycle. I'm only knocking it down a star because I did miss some of the organized crime stuff.",1433808000,,793,4.795620437956204

2853825,4,B000QXDJLI,"I can't give it 5 stars. The Wire is a very original series with great characters and good actors. However, it's difficult for me to stay with it with so much profanity. I've never had to listen to this kind of language on the job or anywhere else I am on a regular basis. The professionals with whom I work and my circle of friends and family would never accept this kind of crude, filthy language. Most consider it uneducated and very low class, which I suppose is representative of the poor and ghetto areas of a city, but doesn't seem realistic in an office setting. The nudity and sex are mostly unnecessary, but it is HBO after all.

I've stuck with it because I want to see how it ends. The irony with which I am most impressed is that The Wire seems to be prophetic of the current Baltimore.",1433721600,,799,4.291390728476821

The acting is so so good but the season we see far less from Dominic West.  But others just get better and  better, Wendall Pierce, Clarke Peters, even Delaney Williams (you probably don't like the sergeant), of course, Andre Royo and Michael Williams.  The cast shines.

We are particularly interested now (though we started the series before) given what is going on in Baltimore these days.  I read a criticism in a magazine of the series recently and felt it was unfounded.
It is amazing to me that the writer/producer were able to get so much reality into such a complicated social system that exists in the inner cities of America.
My only complaint is that I continue to have trouble understanding what everyone is saying, some more than others, and we rely on closed captions to help us out. Also I think some of the goody goody stuff that appears in this Season is a bit too goody goody, though it is true some kids can be turned around. but in these scenes even the delivery of lines seems off.

This season opened my eyes to how poverty affects the school district and vice versa by portraying these young people in a way that makes you care about them.  In real life, the stereotype overshadows any sort of understanding.  I have been changed by Wired in a way I never expected.  I loved this season!",1430611200,,482,4.623529411764705

I'm a stickler for that sort of thing. And I watched The Wire on HBO when it came out in it's original format. And I didn't even notice the difference. The show transforms to a 16:9 ratio very well without impacting the artistic quality of the series.

So don't hesitate to watch The Wire presented on Amazon in a widescreen format. The quality is great and you'll enjoy the show just as much (or more) than you did the first time you watched it.",1428019200,,691,4.2272727272727275

2854239,5,B000QXDJLI,"I was immediately taken in by season 4 because it hit close to home...the school system. It tells the truth.  Yes, I'm a teacher, but anybody connected with schools, including parents, Boards, administrators, and anybody who ever went to school, should care about season four.  The Wire shows the futility of one school system, the one down in the hole, but it transfers to so many of them above ground.  Prez, who didn't have much going for him in his old job as a cop, becomes a teacher.  I''m not reiterating here that ""Those who CAN do, and those who can't, teach,"" but in a tough, undisciplined environment, you'd think an ex-cop would excel.  Not so.  Prez stood there while one student sliced the face of another.  An issue which puzzled him, as well as the other teachers, was that their whole job was just teaching to the test.  What's new?  One teacher expressed that the only thing these kids needed to learn was how to survive.  There's often one student you care about because they show promise.  Dukie was one of these.  He could do computers, but it didn't work.  The environment he came from was stronger than the hope Prez had for the boy.  My favorite character, Bubbles, who survived by informing the police about what went on in the drug culture he lived in, tried to keep Sharrod, his young protege in school.  It didn't work. Bubbles accidentally killed him while trying to off another person who was constantly abusing him.  Too sad.
We do see that one of the four new young boys entering season 4 tries to save his little brother despite a tragic home life by keeping him in school.  He can't do it because he gets too involved in the violence, and must sadly send him to a relative (a new environment) to live.  But we see the little one crying as he leaves the car, and we can only hope that the loss of his big brother won't destroy him.  It's reality beautifully portrayed.

In season four we still have the police following the drugs.  Marlo represents the worst of the drug kingpins you find in a place like this.  He's smart, ambitions but ill-advised, thinking he could run with the Greeks and their international business. He actually kills lots of people but hides them in vacant buildings so there aren't any bodies.  Stringer used to be tops, being a legitimate businessman, but he worked both sides of the street, which will always catch up with you.  And Avon Barksdale, the main one the police have been chasing, is in jail.

In season 4, the main theme, which started in season 3, was politics. It is so representative ""down in the hole"", as it is above ground.  In three, when politicians were adamant about keeping the numbers below 300 by pushing the druggies off the corners and into safe zones called Hamsterdam, I laughed. That was hilarious. And up-and-coming politician, Carcetti, reminds me of all of the young presidential hopefuls today. You think he's a good guy, but you don't really know.  He keeps changing.  Just because McNulty, main cop, detective, etc. in the show, gets interested in the homeless, Carcetti does...or seems to.  Everybody always wants to tackle the ""Homeless"" problem.
The show tells it like it is.",1426896000,,3174,4.648114901256733
2854240,5,B000QXDJLI,Same excellent rating as first 3 seasons.  The boys are back in the hood and also now politics moves in to play in Baltimore.  Just like real life who is the crook and who is the politician.  Watch it but keep them in order.,1426896000,,224,4.045454545454546

It is an eye opener as to the extent of corruption in all walks of life and in the life in the city of Baltimore.

Story is a bit complicated and it is advised to read an introduction and get an idea of the storyline and the main  characters.  In particular getting to know the names and roles of the Afro American cast.  As the show develops the story lines and characters become very grappling and entertaining.

I found it a more gripping and enjoyable show than Breaking Bad.",1424649600,,702,4.666666666666667

There is no ""formula"" applied to each show, so you rarely know what is going to happen. It is definitely not like any other TV show I have seen. I'm always surprised, if not shocked, when a likeable character, from either side of the tracks, gets eliminated. Its a good series, that I think is worth investing a little time to explore.

2854512,5,B000QXDJLI,"I really like the middle schoolers in this season. Probably because I teach middle school. Though I did find it hard to believe that Mr. Prezbo would be as beloved by his students by the fifth episode.
Thought the idea of the socialization class was really interesting and wish there was more of that type of thinking in education and this was aired on HBO 9 years ago. Nothing has really changed for the current generations of Du Quans and Namons--which is sad.

The drug dealers, politicians and cops were interesting. I think Marlow is a lot smarter than people on both sides. However will that intelligence turn to arrogance. It's just fascinating to watch.",1424390400,,661,4.747826086956522

The way it rounds about the series' stories to show you how a city like Baltimore can only try to improve, but ultimately and inevitably fails. The child actors are all incredibly, and I loved the story of the Baltimore public schools. I really admire the way the show abandons star actors' characters in favor of characters relevant to the new plot--most shows would feel necessitated to shoehorn the stars in somehow.

2854603,5,B000QXDJLI,"Through the series, it depicts the absolute corruption in leftist democratic controlled cities across the U. S. It also excoriates the involvement of the federal government and liberal do gooders in the educational system. After watching this season, it is apparent that the breakdown in the black community is due to the lack of a cohesive family unit, corrupt or incompetent workers in the system and race hustlers like Al Sharpton. I was born, raised and worked in a big city environment, so I know of that which I write. This series can easily hook you into watching, but the strong language and streetspeak is not for everyone.

2854671,5,B000QXDJLI,"This is a very well developed series with the rare sense to not drag the story beyond its attention-holding limits. In S.4, the leitmotive established in S.1 becomes a device that explains and expands the story of the fast deteriorating state of ""education"" in the USA, or the systemic corruption of the social foundations gradually replaced with clay feet.

Even the most dense viewer watching S.4 has to grasp the obvious hint writ large: the pathocrats' experiment in successfully trashing the silent and fearful 99.9% by preying on their stupidity, greed, racism and pseudo religiosity, whatever their skin color, has succeeded. Or to paraphrase pastor Niemoeller's words:
  While they trashed the future of the Black community,
  The Whites said nothing, because they lived far from the the inner city ghettoes.
  While they derided the Gays' desire for a full family and social life,
  The pseudo-religious fanatics said nothing, because they believed their corrupt pastors.
  When they attacked women who prefer an abortion to bringing an unwanted and unloved life into being,
  The bigots said nothing, because their stupidity prevented them from seeing themselves as their puppet masters' useful idiots.
  When the carpet is finally pulled from under the immoral majority,
  There will be no one left to speak for them.

The crashing of the once mighty empire is in free fall and about to pass the point of no return; the lesson of the entire series.
Kudos to everyone who made this series a most deeply meaningful experience.",1419724800,,1535,5.120967741935484

2854689,5,B000QXDJLI,"This season made me re-evaluate every assumption I've ever made about the role drugs and poverty plays in the cycle of violence and hopelessness that inner-city residents are forced to contend with on a day-to-day basis.  It explores the enormous disconnect between white America and black America and was summarized amazingly well by the principal of the middle school around which the action revolves:  ""You can't save all of them.""

This should be required viewing by educators and law makers everywhere.  The season was exceptionally well-written and the story line will keep your attention from episode one through the end.  This is intelligent television and begs the viewers to make up their own minds over complex issues; you don't feel so much guided along to draw conclusions as you feel forced through a gauntlet of one misfortune after the next, with only occasional glimmers of hope to prevent you from succumbing to despair.

Season Four of The Wire is among the greatest seasons of any television series in the last twenty years.  Nearly ten years after filming ended, this show remains frighteningly relevant.",1419292800,,1125,5.114754098360656

The writers, producers, directors, cinematographers, and actors truly deserve the academy award for a really outstanding  creation in the making of 'The Wire'.  And for television, this is truly an unusual and outstanding piece of film making, because as we all have experienced, much of what televsion produces truly caters to the the unthinking and unimaginative mind who appreciates redundant predictable repitition in television performances  the television series 'The Wire' is a modern day Charles Dickens American style  outstanding.",1418860800,,1115,5.271186440677966

2854757,3,B000QXDJLI,"Downer of a series, the bad guys win a lot more than the good guys.  Wins for the good guys often seemed hopeless and gradually through the series became less and less frequent. I watched it through the first episode of Season 5 then gave up on it, it began to really drag starting with Season 4.

Portrays what could very easily be reality between cops and drug dealers... generally the dregs of society (borne of the complete break down of the family structure, a totally dysfunctional group of people) combined with corruption in government in what could be any major U.S. city.

Many of the actors are very charismatic and that's what kept me watching it.  The abundance of foul language sometimes made me cringe... it could have been just as effective without it.  Very little positive or up-beat about the series... not much redeeming value.

Definitely not much ""feel good"" about this show.

2854788,3,B000QXDJLI,The show felt hijacked by the politics police. Our favorite characters played second string to the politics of public school education in this country. While I am all for advocating for a better system I could only imagine that the message was being lost of the very people whose lives mirrored these boys. No one wants to be preached to and if that's what was going to happen then you better bring your A game and do it so no one knows. This was too obvious and the stories so one dimensional that it pained me to get through those episodes. The show lost its way and was taking its best with it. Only my initial attraction to the main characters from Season One kept me willing to see it through but for hardcore young fans I'll bet they jumped ship quickly.,1417219200,,760,4.359154929577465

2854810,5,B000QXDJLI,"Season 4 does not disappoint.  The writers for The Wire manage to interweave characters and plot lines from previous seasons with a new core storyline about a group of young friends trying to make it on the mean streets of inner city Baltimore.  You see the consequences of self-absorbed political horse trading behind the scenes, affecting everything from police investigations to school funding and programs.  The undercurrent of violence and heartbreak is never far from view, playing out in cold brutality but all baked inside ""the game"", the hard, unforgiving world of the drug dealers, their suppliers and their tormentors, yes Omar is back with a vengeance.  You see well intentioned characters trying to change the course of events, each in their own way, some trying to save some small personal semblance of morality, others trying to do for friends what they couldn't for themselves.  You see the black hole pull of the drug world, sucking people in as hapless users, beckoning to the still innocent to join in and earn some hard to come by cash.  There is hope here but it's thwarted so often and so tragically at times.  One thing this season does as all others, it whets your appetite for Season 5.  Ultimately, this is where The Wire's success resides, in the way it makes you root for characters or stifle the urge to smile at their demise.  Another moving and powerful effort with terrific performances, brilliant camera work, directing and writing.  Enjoy...",1416528000,,1475,4.935222672064778

This season has a strong focus on the kids of Baltimore and like all of the seasons of The Wire, it's troubling to think that events depicted here are happening everyday.

My favorite character was Bugs and it was good to see he was able to get it together and have a family at the end.  I respected his sister for making it hard on him because I think families of drug addicts have to set limits but writing off a loved one is very hard.

2854894,5,B000QXDJLI,"Best season of the four I've watched. The plot centers on kids growing up in west Baltimore - colleges could offer this as a project in Sociology 101.

Former detective ""Prez"" reincarnation as a middle school teacher is an excellent story line. He's one of the most likeable characters on a show with many. If the Wire was one of those commercially successful shows like CIS, or Law and Order, Prez would have his own spin-off eventually.

Simply the best TV series I've ever seen - much more than a simple cop show. More like a modern version of a Charles Dickens story.",1414368000,,571,4.533980582524272

In Season 4, however, they've taken a much deeper look at the human drama behind drug trafficking and addiction. By the end of many episodes, you may expect to sit still, watching a blank screen, slightly shaking your head and thinking ""damn...""

2854924,5,B000QXDJLI,"Season 4 takes awhile to get going. The unit is disbanded by the politics of the police department and the city. The main star of the show, takes a back seat. That would be the character of McNulty. I have read that the actor who plays him had requested a lesser role to spend more time with his family in Europe, so that explains that situation. There are still many great characters in this season. The bad guy you like to root for is Omar, who is a modern day Robin Hood. And of course Bubbles, who starts taking a regular beating from a street thug. He does ask for help from the Herc, who promises him help. Bubbles doesn't get any and plays a great prank on Herc, then Bubbles seems to know he has to take matters into his own hands.

Pres has given up police work and ends up becoming a teacher in a rough middle school. But his life still intertwines with his fellow officers.

The Major Crime squad starts to get back into action after the new Mayor takes the reins and tries to eliminate some of the politics of the BPD.

Although this series seems to take a different path from the previous 3 seasons, it's still a great show and I enjoy it tremendously.",1413763200,,1165,4.262443438914027

Now imagine a whole group of Wallaces having to play the hands they've been dealt with, each doing so in his own particular way.

2855225,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is a scary, unsettling, terrific, addictive series. Season 4 took us into the inner lives of the kids growing up in the Baltimore subculture of crime and drugs. It was engrossing, hard to watch at times but also impossible to turn away from. All the characters are very well-developed in all four seasons. It's one of the best series I've seen.",1407628800,,353,4.619047619047619

2855229,5,B000QXDJLI,Not your usual police series..This show reminds me of the old NYPD Blue..It shows the real lives of drug addicts and dealers..I found myself getting wrapped up in their lives and almost cried when one of the dealers or rather corner men got killed and yea rooting for the bad guys and a drug addict.

The story and plot has to viewed in order or you would really be lost.  This 4th season was easier to watch and keep up with all the actors, and story line.

This show is brutal in its portrayal of desperate people doing what they do to survive. There are no clear cut 'good guys'. There are some awful characters, absolutely, and even these are written so well that they never seem two-dimensional. The whole series gets a '5'.",1406937600,,388,5.174603174603175

2855291,5,B000QXDJLI,"A series that I truly hated to see end. The makers of this show truly built, for the viewer, a way to really feel for both the police as well as the people of B-City. From the first episode of season one to the end of season five I was hooked. I only wished that there were five more seasons. Praised, by Time Magazine as one of the best series on TV ever, built up an expectation that I doubted could truly be reached. However, by the series end I would agree. At times it had the feel of a documentary rather than a fictional TV show. I had everything, both good and bad guys that a person could identify with.

2855315,5,B000QXDJLI,"I think that one of the reasons this season is so strong is because we came to care for those four children. We saw them struggle in the face of their abandonment, first by their parents and then by the schools. We rooted for them. When we saw three of them becoming men, we sensed the possibility that no one would ever root for them again. We saw how the children we cared for could be cast off as adults  (Is this where David Simon implicates us, the viewers?)  Namond was the lucky one. He was taken in by Colvin and he was given the opportunity to thrive, which only made us ponder the many ""what if""s that eluded the others.",1406073600,,630,4.198347107438017

2855390,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire deals with politics, police and poverty in Baltimore. The title of the series comes from season one, and law enforcement's attempt to quell drug sales and the violence that always accompanies it using wire taps.
But this show, one of  HBO's finest,  goes far beyond that. Each season of The Wire focused on one area in the war on drugs and its casualties.
 Season 4 deals with education, and while it takes place in Baltimore, it surely could be any mid-sized city...And quite a few small towns as well.  The Wire shows young, YOUNG people...some good, some bad, some on the fence, but ALL trapped in a cycle of poverty, drugs and the political processes that continue to fail them.
The acting is incredible. The writing, impeccable. The stories, undeniably moving.  The Wire is gritty, violent,  and unabashedly realistic. The language is often coarse,  the action unmistakably adult. This drama holds nothing back, and surely is not for everyone. But if you appreciate hard-hitting urban drama, police procedure, or political maneuvers, please give The Wire a chance.",1404777600,,1078,4.988826815642458

Watching David Simon's and Ed Burns's brilliant screen plays, and the taut acting and directing, makes one wonder how it is that previously troubled cities are now the center of political and civic progress, while state and federal government continues to look more like these depictions of Baltimore ten years ago.

2855405,5,B000QXDJLI,"After four seasons, this is still an amazing show.  This may be the best season yet, as we move into the school system, and see the different ways that kids on the streets can be ""educated,"" whether it's in the schools or on the streets. We grew very attached to several of the kids, and were devastated as their stories unfolded to the finale.  This was one of the best shows on T.V. ever.  Our only criticism is that every season (and we're now starting our fifth), the ending is depressing.  This season, another one of the major characters is killed off.  While there's frequently hope on an individual basis and while individuals, including the teachers, police and government officials, strive to make the system work and make their communities better, there's never an uplifting end to any season, even though there's always an expectation people will keep trying.  We love the realism of the show, but it's the same story arc, even though each storyline is new and incredibly insightful. It often feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, where things can go either way, but where many of our favorite characters are star-crossed and even as they strive to do the right thing, particularly the street kids, they are doomed.  I feel I've learned a lot about how local government, the public schools, crime and corruption all work in tandem.  It's been an education.  I only wish, just once, the season could have ended on a generally uplifting note.",1404604800,,1450,4.791164658634538

2855448,5,B000QXDJLI,The wire series from HBO and David Simon is an example of art copying life.  After working for three years on a federal drug squad in Baltimore circa 1980s my drug enforcement days come rushing back to me when I watch the Wire.  Sometimes the names have been changed to protect the guilty.  Sometimes Simon uses real names but changes the character's role.  I think the early seasons are the best.

I watched the whole series in a week's time ...that is the best way to hold the story close.
Bravo to the writers, actors and the many supporting members who developed this series. I think is is one of the few TV classics which will survive as characteristic of our modern times.

The new ones just don't have the excitement (acting power) the original actors had. Nor does the story line do much to generate any real viewer interest in them.

2855570,5,B000QXDJLI,"We are all full of differing opinions and points of view, even those of us who love The Wire. So I feel like I have to say that this was the best season, IN MY OPINION. But I know it is an opinion held by many.

The Wire is so realistic and natural that it's easy to forget that the actors are acting, and I don't think I gave them enough credit in seasons 1-3. As others have mentioned, it was a risky move to put four middle school-aged kids at the forefront of this season. But it worked. I was truly riveted by the acting in this season. Without the heartfelt, honest performances of young actors Maestro Harrell, Jermaine Crawford, Julito McCullum and Tristan Wilds, season 4 could have turned out far differently. Robert Wisdom's Bunny Colvin is a character so full of honor and humility that I get choked up just thinking of his time on screen. (Without giving anything away, his scene with Wee-Bey is a thing of beauty.) Andre Royo is at the top of his game as Bubbles tragically hits rock bottom. Gbenga Akinnagbe is quietly terrifying as Chris Partlow, and Clarke Peters and Wendell Pierce never, ever disappoint. There is so much I could rave about, but there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. Season 4 of The Wire is simply television at its best. It's smart, funny, gritty, thought-provoking, and, in a way that previous seasons had not been, utterly heartbreaking.",1372291200,,1393,4.549800796812749
2855571,5,B000QXDJLI,"If you have yet to discover this amazing series, wire yourself in immediately!!!  The first season was honestly a little slow, and I wondered what everyone had been raving about.  Stick with it and you will be rewarded with brilliantly written stories peopled with characters from every walk of life.  Andre Royo is a revelation as ""Bubbles"" the drug addict struggling to create his own ""shopping cart empire"", as is Idris Elba playing a powerful drug king pin and doing a great American accent - yes, ladies he's actually from England!  Every character is fascinating in their foibles and their humanity.  The picture painted of these particular areas of Baltimore is horrendous and was a revelation for this British expat - actually it bears a strong resemblance to areas of Liverpool, England (my hometown) or the Watts/Compton areas of L.A. - but no matter where the location, the inhabitants are compelling!

I bought this set a couple years back, and lent them to a friend who somehow lost them while moving.  I bought them a second time and don't regret it a bit.

2855586,5,B000QXDJLI,"Since I do not subscribe to HBO, I was not familiar with The Wire prior to buying the first season based purely on the likeness of Dominic West on the box cover.  I had seen Mr. West in the BBC production of The Hour and became an admirer at that time both of him and the show.
I took the set of the first season home, settled down and watched the first episode, then the second, the third and soon I had devoured all five.  Fascinated with the story lines as well as the acting, I soon availed myself of the remaining seasons.  I finished the last of season five late last night. It is quite simply the best show of its kind on television.
A major appeal is that while writers David Simon, Ed Burns et al set the story in Baltimore, the plots could have been ripped from our local papers.  Deadly home invasions, drug busts, police chiefs resigning under pressure, newspapers hanging on by a thread, disillusion with bureaucratic bunglers and so on and so on.
In fact, when I pass the sets on to my friends and relatives, I include pertinent news clippings from our daily papers.  Having taught in the local public schools, I can attest to the authenticity of Prezbos experience.
Just as the writing is superb with literary references juxtaposed with gritty street language, so is the acting.  Literally dozens of performances could be praised were there space enough and time, but the aforementioned West along with Idris Elba as Stringer Bell and Andre Royo as Bubbles, especially Bubbles, were outstanding.
What lifts The Wire above its competition is the complexity of the characters.  A couple seems purely evil while the others are purely human.  That is they have layers of moralitysometimes admirable, oftentimes not so much.  The pressure they endure of trying to do their jobs, to survive, to perhaps prevail only to be frustrated  allows the viewer to empathize with their situations even while deploring their clay feet.
Each season tackles a different aspect of the situations they face: the police, the schools, the newspaper, the politics and shows how they are intertwined and how the individuals are caught in the web.
Great, great production and Im grateful that its available on CD as its possible to get more out of the experience by having it all available at once instead of waiting for weeks.  Thanks Mr. Simon and thanks Amazon.
I have recommended this series to all my friends and family.  When they have finished watching, I intend to donate it to the local library.",1361404800,,2493,4.705747126436782

2855611,5,B000QXDJLI,"Let's be clear The Wire is without a doubt one of the best television shows of the 2000s and arguably the best television show of all time. The realism and the complex and intricate storylines that are beautifully woven makes this series a one of a kind. That being said it's hard to say which season of the series is the best, yet this one without a doubt will leave a lasting impression. This season focuses less on the drug trade but rather the heavily flawed public school system. Focuses on the ""Boys of Summer"" (Randy, Dukie, Michael and Namond) and their trials that they face in and out of school. As the season progresses we see the fates of some of these characters begin to take place and eventually is the beginning of them becoming the new generation of replacing the main characters on the show. This is the defining season of the show. The political debate between Royce and Carcetti, Major Crimes fight against Marlo is among the other things that drive this season. The eventual result of all the character's actions in this season becomes the focal point in the final season.

The school system potrayed in the season is so realistic that makes you wonder if the system and the police department really go hand in hand. To see how the schools work is enough to make some people think, cringe or quite frankly get very upset. Creator David Simon brought into light the corruption of the school system with such detail that it can't be ignored.

Overall, the best season of The Wire bar none. For this season explores not the drug trade. But rather, it explores the reason why many go down in that direction. In otherwords, how it all began.",1344384000,,1657,4.575757575757576

2855614,4,B000QXDJLI,"*Spoiler alert*

Before I begin my review, I want to warn you that I'll be discussing some plot points that occured in season 3. If you haven't seen seasons 1-3 of 'The Wire', then I highly recommend you do not read further.

Ready? Okay.

With Stringer Bell dead and Avon Barksdale out of the picture, 'The Wire' was now forced to focus on new characters and plot lines. This was accomplished by directing the majority of the scenes onto a group of young kids in conjunction with the political race for the next mayor of Baltimore.

I think season 4 did a nice job of keeping things moving along. With the two biggest villains from previous seasons off the show, evil was now embodied by the characters of Marlo, Snoop, and Chris. Terrifying figures for sure, but certainly not the complex characters we came to know in both Stringer and Avon.

Another huge change in season 4 was the absence of McNulty. Sure, he was still on the show, but he played a much smaller role in season 4. McNulty is one of the more entertaining and engaging characters from 'The Wire', and I think the season overall suffered from his lack of involvement in the story lines.

Of course 'The Wire' is always filled with interesting story lines and superb acting. I certainly can't label season 4 as anything less than 'excellent'. However I personally did not enjoy it much as the instant classics that were seasons 1-3. However I do hold it to be a level above a startlingly uneven season 5. (Which I've also reviewed on this site.)",1337040000,,1512,4.560885608856089

The hard hitting reality of school life in Baltimore takes centre stage while the city's drug control turns to the ambitious Marlo Stanfield, away from the once all powering Barksdale organisation. Like seasons gone by, The Wire tackles some on the vital elements of American life today and now shows in-depth the decaying nature of education and that even worse times could lie ahead for a city that has seen it all. Im not here to tell you what happens, just let it be know, Burns and Simon are not to blow you away with twist and turns, rather expertly put on display the issues we face today. With us, the fourth season of The Wire is the King of all Television, the pinnacle of any show could ever attempt to live up to, go on, say it aint so.",1327795200,2,872,4.490566037735849

2855621,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire had me hooked by the time I finished the 1st season for the 1st time a year ago - I've never had HBO on my cable system (cable TV's already too expensive & adding another $15 to it every month would be torture!!). But friends had been hounding me to watch the series because they thought I'd find it appealing. I found it MORE than appealing - I was mesmerized!

The 4th season is the best b/c Simon & his writing team tackle how the Baltimore drug trade, police corruption & political corruption & campaigning all effect inner city schools. The storyline is fascinating & what I've always liked about every season of this show is how every detail is tied together. NO other show I've seen has ever done that so effectively. Watch this show from Season 1 & you won't be disappointed!!",1323302400,,793,4.431506849315069

2855623,5,B000QXDJLI,This series is mind-blowing. It goes beyond the level of good crime show. It's more of a social study on the contributing factors to the cycle of poverty and crime. No. 4 is my favorite season. Heartbreaking and beautifully put together.,1313452800,,237,4.804878048780488
2855624,4,B000QXDJLI,"The best thing about this series is trying to figure out EXACTLY what's going on. Nothing is spelled out; there are no expository scenes, no ""previously on THE WIRE""....introductions; you have to piece it all together from a series of shortish scenes in which there are no concessions to any unfamiliarity with street or police-patois. We have to do all the work ourselves.

In other words, this series is MADE for DVD-viewing. I can understand why this wasn't a ratings success when originally shown on TV; how could you possibly remember everything you need to follow all the story-lines when you're only getting one episode a week? Even with the DVD's you might need to watch the episodes a couple of times to grasp it all. So if you like TV that demands intensive viewing this may well be the ne plus ultra of the breed.

Not that a lot happens. If you require a series of dramatic happenings a la ""24"" to keep you engaged you're probably going to be bored. The object is to be as realistic and un-TV as possible and if that means there isn't going to be an outlandish twist in the plot every 30 minutes or so then so be it. In fact, it's more like a quasi-documentary than a dramatic fiction. No doubt it'll be employed in classrooms as an aid to understanding inner-city problems; it's very strong in showing the nearly intractable problems of policing and educating a city like Baltimore. To its credit, this show doesn't preach or propose any comprehensive solutions; its related weakness is that it tends to dabble in ideas without coming to any conclusions at all.

Which may well be the reason I wasn't completely satisfied. It's just that I require some sort of resolution and neither in its dramatic or its sociological aspects did I get any sense of....what is the word of the zeitgeist?.......CLOSURE, that's it! Perhaps Season Five will do the trick?

I should mention that you will almost certainly need to have watched (AND understood) SEASON THREE first before viewing this. There are far too many unexplained references to events and characters in the earlier season to make this intelligible on its own.",1311552000,,2124,4.732432432432432

2855626,5,B000QXDJLI,"Let me begin with by stating that I used to consider LAW & ORDER and NAKED CITY the standard by which TV dramas were measured,but with DIRECTV replaying the whole series from 1st to last episode,I simply must 'GO WITH MY GUT',as the detectives would say and admit what was surely the truth to begin with:IN MY 54 YEARS I HAVE NOT SEEN TV THAT COMBINES RELEVANCE,ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING WRITING,AND 1ST CLASS PERFORMANCES ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT as I have seen in every season of THE WIRE.If I'm not mistaken,HBO 1st brought this show to America as a fill-in while the Sorpranos was on hiatus. It garnered so much attention coming on the heels of 'THE CORNER', that it had to be brought back to travel it's own 5 season arc. I think that instead of pointing fingers at what is wrong with Television Today,we should point to programs such as THE WIRE as being what is right with the medium. HBO takes you into the streets of Baltimore and dissects the issues of a Modern urban area with a degree of throughness & thoughtfulness that is rare in TV IN ANY ERA.The only thing left for me to say is to HEARTILY AGREE with Mr. Liebenson that it is an absolute travesty that this show has been nominated for only one EMMY!!!I have to eventually buy all 5 seasons so i don't have to rely on cable tv's generosity anymore!!!!!",1305590400,,1314,4.479166666666667

I know the show was famously overlooked by most major awards, and that's probably due to the extreme language and violence, but I think was completely unfair.

2855633,5,B000QXDJLI,"I won't attempt to synopsize the entire Season 4 in this review since so many others have done it so well.  I will only say that the focus on Baltimore's inner-city school system, its beleaguered teachers and its tragic youth was both eye-opening and heartbreaking.  The thing that makes THE WIRE so great is its profound sense of realism.  It's almost as if you're a fly on the wall looking into the real-life social convulsions of a city on the brink of self-destruction.  There are so many layers of ineptitude, corruption, selfishness, greed, posturing, frailty, savagery, despair, and so on in Season 5 of THE WIRE, that it's a wonder anyone survives.  But survive they do, and life goes on.  However, when children get into the mix, as they do in Season 4, the bitter taste of this convoluted stew makes the streets of Baltimore seem so unbearably sad.  Season 4 puts young faces on a sweeping social malaise that haunts Baltimore (and many American cities, for that matter).  The problem is, nobody wants to see them.  Unless, of course, they get into trouble - the point at which they get lots of attention and are generally demonized.  This series dares to tell the truth - hence its lack of awards and general neglect.

Watch THE WIRE.  If you're anything like me, you'll feel as if you're experiencing more than a mere television series - you're getting a look into a reality that will change the way you think about the inner-city, its myriad problems and the cops and politicians who try to solve them.",1270339200,4,1515,4.675471698113207

2855636,5,B000QXDJLI,"Once again, this season expands into new territory.  It already covers city politics, the so-called drug war, and cops v. gangsters.  This time around, a whole new roster of characters - the children who will staff the street and those who will be preyed upon - is introduced.  The child actors are absolutely perfect, indeed there is not a single note from them that does not ring true.  You empathize with them, even though their experience is beyond anything us suburban types could truly imagine.  You hope for these kids, despise some of them, and weep for their lack of options.

Meanwhile, the lives of the cops move on.  Having taken a beat cop position far beneath his talents, McNulty seems to have turned his life around with a new relationship, moderate drinking, and some satisfaction at his accomplishments however ambivalent he feels about ending the game with Barksdale.  You really hope for him as the other cops take center stage.  But the real action is in the schools, where the ex-cops (Prez and the disillusioned and controversial captain who quasi-legalized drugs) are attempting to reach the kids.  And of course, there is the rise of Marlo, the shrewd sociopath who is taking the crown of Baltimore drug king.

What is so amazing about this series is that it never falls into formula or stereotype.  In addition to surprise plot twists, the characters are so realistic that the viewer believes them implicitly.  Even the ironies are believable.  In terms of resolutions, things are never cleanly tied off, but end in compromise or failure, often tragically.

Warmly recommended.  This is the best.",1261180800,2,1622,4.929889298892989

2855639,4,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth season of ""The Wire"" seemed more like a bridge to the explosive final season, with one notable exception. Having left the police force, Det. 'Prez' Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost) takes a job as an eight grade teacher and becomes this year's MVP. Education and politics wrap themselves around each other as an intense Mayoral race where Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen) is trying to upset the political establishment while another formally disgraced officer ""Bunny"" Colvin (Robert Wisdom) again tries to break convention by taking problem students and derailing the ""pass 'em up"" mentality forced on schools by ""No Child Left Behind.""

In fact, major player Jimmy McNulty takes something of a backseat this season (although he takes an astonishing turn in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-fifth-season/dp/B00123BY6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the fifth season</a>) to the electoral intrigue. That is not to say the drugs and the corners are gone; the rise of Marlo Stansfield takes a major place in the multi-story plotlines. The streets are still where the action is, and the students of Edward Tilghman Middle School are the pivot for which this season turns.

2855642,5,B000QXDJLI,"THE WIRE is more than just a crime drama: with stark realism, the series probes the interconnected social problems plaguing America's inner cities. Set on the streets of West Baltimore, THE WIRE reveals the consequences of the drug trade and the corruption of the political world, while maintaining suspense and drawing the viewer into a world that all too often goes ignored.

Season Four focuses on education, showing just how badly the inner city school system is failing the kids in its charge. Former cop Roland ""Prez"" Pryzbylewski becomes a teacher and does his best to reach his students despite institutional obstacles and the violence that follows them into the classroom. Since funding is dependent on student performance on standardized tests, the school's administration insists on devoting most class time to practice test questions, disrupting Prez's teaching just as he was making headway. Prez draws an interesting comparison between ""teaching to the test"" and ""juking the stats,"" whereby law enforcement makes a large number of petty arrests in order to create impressive stats, while ignoring more time-intensive serious crimes and underlying problems.

The season follows four eighth grade boys--Michael, Namond, Randy, and Duquan (Dukie)--as they come of age amid the dangerous realities of the streets and the pull of the corner. Michael is a quiet observer and the unspoken leader of the group; he tries to stick to his principles, acting as a parent for his little brother Bug and maintaining his loyalty to his friends. Even though he shows little interest in the drug game, the necessity of protecting his brother makes the corners hard to resist. Namond's father is in prison, and his mother (who is used to the material comforts her husband's drug activity brought) encourages him to follow in his father's footsteps even though he is not cut out for that life. Randy, who has been shuffled through group and foster homes all his life, ends up in the home of a caring foster mother only to have his life turned upside-down when he snitches on a member of Marlo Stanfield's formidable drug empire. Dukie is intelligent and good with computers, but his situation is the direst: he barely gets enough to eat, and his family sells his clothes in order to buy drugs.

One of the most tragic aspects of the show is that it shows how much is stacked up against anyone who tries to do the right thing. This is the case whether it's the four boys trying to navigate their world, a teacher striving to educate his students, law enforcement personnel following the trail of corruption or chasing a wave of homicides, a politician who must choose between children's futures and political expediency, or even a drug dealer trying to follow a dying code. As much as you root for the show's characters, THE WIRE does not sugarcoat these realities. Not too many ""Hallmark moments"" here.

Bill Moyers said on his show the Journal that what Charles Dickens was to the mean streets of Victorian London, WIRE co-creator David Simon is to today's America. He's right. Full of gritty reality, nuance, and empathy, THE WIRE takes us where most of the media world refuses to go on anything other than a superficial level.

It makes me think that issues happening in some areas across America do not only have local effects, but they also have state and national effects.  It challenges me: what can I do to help?",1240358400,,354,4.5
2855646,5,B000QXDJLI,"This is perhaps the strongest of the four seasons of this outstanding series I have seen so far. It is unremittingly dark and honest; it has grown way beyond entertainment to become a penetrating and withering examination of what's worst about U.S. society.
This time, the authors take us into the Baltimore school system. We get to know a few of the students, their parents as well as teachers and administrators. These are kids who come from the meanest streets of the city -- their parents are dope fiends or felons. They are foul-mouthed, undisciplined, lack motivation and are unsocialized. In one of the most insightful moments of the entire series, one of the characters comments, ""They aren't educating themselves for our world. They're developing the survival skills they need for their world.""
One of the students we meet is Michael: his mother is a heroin addict who gives away her own kids' food money to buy drugs. She has shacked up with an abusive man. Michael struggles to protect himself and his young half brother. By the end of the season, he has turned to drug dealers for protection and has become a cold-blooded killer.
Another kid makes the mistake of confiding in a policeman. His house is fire-bombed, his mother grievously injured and he winds up in a group foster home being beaten up as a snitch by his roommates.
A third kid is given a chance of escaping this grim reality when he's adopted by a former police officer. His natural mother's only ambition for her son is for him to become a successful street corner drug dealer and soldier for a trafficking gang.
Since the first season, the dealers on the corners have changed. The Avon Barksdale gang in the first series could be bloody killers but it was all in the pursuit of business -- it was part of what they all call ""the game."" They had a certain code of honor. But the gang that now controls the streets are cold-blooded murderers who kill without compunction. They have no code and recognize no restraints.
This multi-faceted series recognizes that the drug trade flourishes in neglected black ghettos where social order has completely broken down. In this series, it shows how this failure, which is a collective failure of all of us in America, poisons the lives of children, consigning them to fruitless, cruel lives, leaving them with the choice of embracing the drugs trade and becoming killers or defying it and risking death.",1239148800,2,2421,4.780429594272077

2855648,5,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth and penultimate season of The Wire sees the show moving into new territory. At the end of Season 3 the Barksdale organisation was finally destroyed for good, McNulty found himself some happiness and Daniels got a promotion. The goals set out in Season 1 had been achieved. So, where next for the Major Crimes Unit and the players of the game?

Season 4 follows several storylines in tandem. The MCU is now chasing down Marlo Stanfield, whose organisation has picked up from where Barksdale left off and now rules over most of the western district of Baltimore. However, their rise to power has apparently been accomplished with virtually no deaths, bemusing Lester Freamon. With the wiretaps also coming up empty, Freamon's attempts to follow the money trail attract the ire of his superiors and pretty soon the MCU is all but shut down and Freamon and Kima end up working in Homicide instead. Elsewhere, McNulty is enjoying the (relatively) easy life as a beat cop, Daniels is heading up his own force and Carver is maturing as an officer, with only Herc apparently resisting any change, at least until he catches the Mayor's eye (in a rather interesting manner) and finds his star rising as a result. But overall the police side of things, at least to start off with, seems pretty quiet.

On the streets Marlo's rise to power has been achieved with the help of his two enforcers, the terrifyingly cold-blooded and ruthless Chris and Snoop, who have come up with a brilliant scheme to hide the resulting bodies from the police. Proposition Joe, who has inherited most of the surviving Barksdale crew, is continuing his efforts to entice Marlo into the cooperative to little avail, so he hatches a scheme to get Marlo on his side by setting up a war between him and the indefatigable Omar. Unfortunately, this leads to a pretty bloody and complicated state of affairs for all concerned.

Elsewhere, Tommy Carcetti is running for the position of mayor, but the race is a difficult three-way contest between him, the incumbent Royce and fellow councilman Tony Gray. Unfortunately, no sooner is the winner in office then they are delivered two massive problems: how to handle the proven incompetence of police commissioner Burrell when they cannot fire him for political reasons, and the discovery that they have a jaw-dropping $54 million budget deficit due to overspending in the schools.

At the same time, Prez, the former MCU member fired from the force in Season 3 after accidentally killing another officer, has started a new life as a maths teacher. His class is noisy, uncooperative, disrespectful and sometimes shockingly violent (one student slashes another's face open with a razor in his first week). However, the primary narrative for Season 4 focuses on four of the students in Prez's class - Randy, Dukie, Namond and Michael. These are all new characters, although with some ties to existing ones: Namond is the son of former Barksdale enforcer Wee-Bey and Michael is a member of Cutty's gym.

The scaling back of the other characters in favour of following these four youngsters around may seem like an odd move, but it pays off brilliantly. Having tackled the police, criminals, politicians, and dockworkers, Season 4 is about teachers, students and the role of education in shaping the lives of the young. Early in the season a divide is identified between those kids who could make something for themselves and the corner kids who don't want to do anything other than stand on the streets and sell drugs to make money, and where the four main characters fall on that divide and how they swap sides and change over the course of the season is fascinating to watch. At first glance Michael seems to be the most positive and promising of the four, but his interest in sports and growing cooperation in class hides a bitter and painful home life that soon leads him into Marlo's circle, whilst happy-go-lucky Randy makes a series of mistakes that prove costly. In fact it's Namond, who is selling drugs from the start and being schooled for a life of crime by his father from behind bars, who undergoes the most interesting and seismic shifts in character, all depicted through the brilliant-as-usual writing and some fine performances from the young actors involved.

Andre Royo as Bubs also has to be singled out for mention, as Bubs hits rock-bottom in this season and Royo's depiction of a man whose already crappy life disintegrates completely is absolutely stunning. At the same time, Dominic West's low availability for the season means that McNulty doesn't appear very much, meaning more screen time for Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Bunk (Wendell Pierce), which is a very welcome move. McNulty does return to prominence in the last two episodes, which set up the direction of the final season pretty well.

The Wire: Season 4 (*****) is as superbly-written, brilliantly funny, expertly-acted and stomach-churningly tragic as ever, except possibly even moreso than the first three seasons. If there is a negative point, it's that Season 4 is the most epic and sprawling season to date, and it takes a while for all the disparate storylines to start pulling together. But when they do, the result is the most powerful and gripping final run of episodes yet.",1230422400,27,5286,4.906040268456376
2855649,5,B000QXDJLI,"I assume if you're reading this review you own, or at least have seen, seasons 1 through 3 of the critically acclaimed program The Wire. If not what are you doing; go out and buy or rent or try to borrow from someone the previous seasons, and start from Season 1. Do not, I repeat do not, skip a single episode much less a season. That might be fine for some TV shows, but not The Wire. The Wire unfolds like a great novel, building on itself piece by piece, and with a scope beyond anything done in television beforehand. It's a show that requires dedication, and with that dedication you will absorb some of the most satisfying experiences you have ever felt from a TV show.

For those that have seen seasons 1 through 3, rest assured that Season 4 isn't only on par with those first three season; in my opinion it suprasses them. Every Wire season ads a new layer to the Baltimore culture, and this season it's the school. For me, as someone who went to inner city schools though not in Baltimore, it was aghast how much I could relate my experiences to those of the kids on the show. There are four major characters--Michael, Namond, Randy, and Dukie--and all are performed by the young actors very well.

I'm not going to give much away. The first episode, like the first episode of the other seasons, purposely frustrates the viewer with many new characters brand new plotlines not always clear, and it's hard to make total sense of it even by the third episode. The more the season progresses the more you appreciate that they did confuse you in the beginning because there always is a payoff. This is the first season that doesn't rely much on the Barksdale crew, but it picks up at the street very well, as it does with the Law, and at the Hall. Along with the School all four aspects of the Wire connect in a way so seamless you're amazed television is capable of something so grand.

Special features include six Audio commentaries, and two nice documentaries on the show. One of the commentaries includes all four actors playing the kids I mentioned above, along with the actor who plays Prop Joe, and it's one of the more memorable commentaries I have seen.",1227830400,7,2170,4.488607594936709
2855650,5,B000QXDJLI,"Short & Sweet.  Didn't watch this series before it was taken off the air.  Heard all the rave reviews.  Did my research and ordered Season 4 (to start with).

Easily the most dynamic TV series of my lifetime.  Incredible acting (and from such young kids), brilliant writing and great storylines.

Powerful, engaging, thought-provoking, eye-popping, emotional, deep, inspiring, gripping, maddening.

There aren't enough words 2 describe this show.

I think what makes this season so real is the fact you'll look at the four boys and easily place them in your own lives as people you'd know.  So to see them face real world problems and make life/death decisions at such young ages and with relatively little information, it hits home hard.

This is what I call ""Reality Television.""  What makes this show all the more impactful is the fact that, sadly, most of these scenarios and portrayals are at least loosely based on real events that went down (and continue 2 go down) in the streets of Baltimore.

I believe a stat from the Special Features Documentary says that 80% of the characters depicted were based on real people!  If that doesn't draw viewers in, I don't know what else will?

This DVD series is a must have.

The series exposed the problems with Baltimore's schools and the political pressures that come from dealing with the citys issues.

There is no melodrama in this series and there is no glossing over of issues. People looking for an answer can look someplace else as the series does not give answers, it just poses questions.

2855656,2,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire in its forth season suffers from both new and recurring problems from past seasons. While the forth season can be a smart docudrama  with its numerous nuances of reality and the references to past seasons, it still fails to be a effective TV show; completely lacking dramatic effect. A educational drama, yes, but not great Tv show, not by a long shot.
  In this latest season of HBO's The Wire, David Simon and Co. try to follow the footsteps of the past seasons  into the schools and largely fail. Why?
  First off, the Wire main case of the the school's ails is flawed and doesn't have the same dramatic execution of last season's legalization of drugs. Additionally the ""hidden bodies"" case that is exposed at the end of the season, does not match up to the great intrigue of past season's single investigations. Also, the school story is simply  too complicated of a story to cover in a single TV season.
  Secondly, as with the last seasons, the show never really delivers the satisfying emotional punch of a hit TV show which is sad  considering this is the forth season of the show. Admittedly, dealing with kids provided plenty of heart wrenching moments, but they were  far too few and between the usual babble of inner city politics and talking fare the show is notorious for.
  Finally, if there was one thing I did love about the forth season of the Wire it was the new kids that single handedly carried the whole season; I just wish I loved the show nearly as much.",1216857600,9,1488,4.548872180451128
2855657,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire, meaning the drug lords of the ghetto get their throwaway cell phones tapped.  Much like Deadwood, the revisionism of the old West, Baltimore, a microcosm of modern urban myth gets its star turn. McNaulty, Bunk, the cops and DA's on one side, dance with the defunct Barkesdale's and the emerging Marlowe gang in an embrace of odd comradeship. The young white pol, Tommy Carcetti , wins the mayoral race over the Black huckster, Royce only to get his eyes opened, the city is in chaos and he has no chance to put his idealistic ideas in play.

Over the last seasons, the drug problem in the black community is shown realistically, the young street hoppers, cash bulging in their street clothes, they end up corpses soon enough along with the zombie-like addicts.  Episodes of quasi-drug legalization in Season 3 actually reduce crime, a HBO experiment that says hey folks, violence will decrease, but your junkies are going to die.  Well, they are anyhow, but that's what our moral leaders cannot face.

Back then I just used to commute from the suburb to the campus without knowing what's happening in the inner city area as depicted in this TV show. Of course I heard about drug problems and prevalent drug-related violences as in every American urban region. When I first watched episodes of the 1st season of the Wire, I immediately realized how narrow-sided and superficial my view of the city has been. As the series went on, I became to feel that America still has hope and promises, judging based on the fact that this kind of masterpiece TV seires could be produced to illuminate people in the real world. This drama also seemed to have succeeded in revealing the broadest spectrum of African-American characters. I wonder why not-so-many American viewers watched [initially] this epic, and I think hopefully as many people in the world as possible should watch this series to appreciate the reality of human society in general.",1216425600,,1079,4.869565217391305

This really demonstrates the lives on inner city children, their day-to-day, how inner city kids are used by the school systems and then discarded, it also brings to light that these kids aren't any different.  They are still kids, but what they are having to deal with on a daily basis would change any one of us.  This series of episodes is riveting television.  What was most interesting to me was also the politics of the police department and the school system.  It is absolutely corrupt, at a level that I would never have suspected.  This series stands with the Sopranos on every level. If you haven't seen the Wire, buy this volume and begin your journey.  Each season is a complete story line, so you can begin anywhere.

Now, first, they're just kids so they deserve some slack, but holy cow, couldn't the people putting this thing together do a better job of orchestrating how the commentary is presented? Clearly, these kids are given no direction as to how to comment. Poor Robert Chew seems there for na reason at all as he has little to no opportunity to insert any useful commentary amid the adolescent banter of the other 4, although he does make the big mistake of providing a spoiler, which really pissed me off. This is Episode 10 dammit. It's the third disc of the season; don't give away plot developments from later episodes. Comment on the episode at hand.

2855670,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire started off as the best and most inteligent cop show on TV. It has now moved on and is simply the bravest and best series ever to come out of America, or Britain for that matter. The is still a lot of cops and drug dealer stuff, but that plot line has to share time with the infighting at City Hall, the Baltimore Police Department and the failures of the Baltimore school system. Without giving to much away, if the local politicians, the police and the schools were as efficient as the drug buisness, then Baltimore would be a much better place to live. While the bosses at the Police Department are fighting amougst themshelves and trying to hide rather than fight crime, the drug dealers have set up a Co-Op to organise the trade in narcotics.

However the main story line concerns four teenagers and their struggle to get something from school and stay out the corner drug trade. The good teachers, including 'Prez' who has left the police, are ground down by the system which presumes that the kids will fail.

The new drug kingpin is Marlo from series 3 a cold businessman whose ruthlessness makes Avon Barkesdale look like your ideal neighbour. One draw back is that because of the various plot lines and the many more characters, all of whom are in true Wire style are given time to develop, you may see to little of your favourite characters from the first three series. In my case this was true with to little being seen of Lester and Kima. Glad to say however that Omar is still plying his deadly and strangely honourable trade.

This is the only show I have seen which portrays working class and underclass America in such detail. It may seem hopeless but you do see people, mainly women, maintaining a decent life under the most extreme circumstances. Others like Cutty turn their back on crime and try to help the neighbourhood kids. In this series even Wee Bay, a ruthless hitman is shown to have a decent side when it comes to keeping his son out of 'The Game'

As in the previous three series there is not a weak performance. This series however the prize must go to Andre Royo as Bubbles who may be a drug addict but is also possably the best man in the series. It will break your heart to what happens to him and Royo's acting is a good as you will ever see.

The bonus features give a lot of interesting information including that a lot of the story and the characters are based on reality. There was for instance a real Baltimore Homicide cop called Bunk.

If you are already a fan you will not need any urging to watch the series.

If you have never watched it go out and buy the first three series because once you have watched the first you will want to see the rest.

Having worked in the Criminal Justice field, I wanted to get a clear story for the purpose of teaching.  The Wire gave a real and accurate look at both the victims of crime and the effects of crime. Played to the teeth by all of the cast.  The Wire Directors recruited some of the best cast and writers for each season.  I own all all of the seasons but the 5th.  The Wire serves as a great teaching tool as well.  Amazon provided a clean video, with good sound and color.  The package arrived in tact and I am very picky where I spend my money.

2855672,4,B000QXDJLI,"The comments the preceded my catching up to The Wire's 4th season were that this fourth season was ""a watermark for dramatic television"" or ""the best thing ever filmed.""  Those are some lofty bits of praise to rise up to, and after falling deeply in love with the first three seasons of The Wire, I'm afraid I don't share the same reservationless love for season four as I do for the first three.  Let me be quick about what I think doesn't actually work - too much budget talk (Carcetti gets into office and what we do is go over the books?), too much drama at the school about struggles with language arts testing scores (this is The Wire, full of beauracratic cynicism, but testing is a bit of a necessary evil), and, mostly, less bombs set off than in previous seasons - our beloved main characters mostly make it through the year unscathed until the last couple of episodes, which is different from how they've done things in the past.

That said, what's left are some of the most memorable moments for our beloved street thugs and not-always-as-beloved cops and politicians, plus an endless string of memorable moments following four boys who'll grow up to meet some destiny this season or the next.  The season surprises most of all with Naimond (Julito McCullum) and Michael (Tristan Wilds), two friends of various degrees of potential whose stories defy predictability by drawing you in with the kid, teenager, and the adult peeking out of every interaction they have.  We follow them as they flirt with, walk away from, and, quietly, conclude where their lives on the street and in school will take them, and the results are both subtle and heartbreaking, enormous and genuine.  This show has never had a bad performance, but in season four, it's McCullum and Wilds who take honest, no frills acting to a new degree - when Naimond quietly cries, in the season's penultimate episode, ""Michael isn't Michael anymore,"" you know not only the sad truth of that statement, but also both the tragedy and hope of the society that changes dreams and molds life.  That work is staggering, the budgeting work is not.",1206403200,,2115,4.730978260869565

2855674,5,B000QXDJLI,"I just finished watching the last episode of Season 4 of the HBO drama ""The Wire"". And I can say without any hesitation, the Wire is groundbreaking, one of the finest television series to ever hit the airwaves. Gritty, realistic, with a heart and soul for it's characters that's wide and awesome. I'm literally in shock over what I was able to watch over the last few nights.

Oddly, I hadn't watched any of the episode leading up to this season. My initial interest in the show was for the ""school"" focus it had; and the realities of education today. I've been attuned to watching other shows that featured schools, and have become very cynical about them in the past. In most shows, the kids are clean, well dressed, well fed, and sit primly at their desks, in a classroom of 12 twelves, offering witty retorts to the teacher. It's enough to make anyone who's spent time in American classrooms of today hurl. The Wire offers no such premise, but an insightful wisdom that has never been shown on television before.

One storyline in this season of the Wire, for there are many, involve four neighborhood boys, Randy, Dukie, Michael, and Namond, who are just entering the eighth grade. They've formed a tight bond, each one offering something to their group, each one a potential victim in the drug world of Baltimore. As the season plays along, each finds themselves in situations where their decision making ability is put to the test, and it's their decisions  at crucial times that drive the honest of their stories. The four actors that play this quartet simply steal the show with their realism, senses of rage, injustice, and eventually, despair.

I could go on and on about the school aspect of this show. They got so much right, the lack of classroom supplies, the overcrowded, disenfranchised students, the sole stress on high stakes testing at the expense of meaningful learning, the teachers -- some visionary and bold, some sell outs. It's the school, the new teacher, Mr. Prez, and how he gives his heart to these kids that offer the true heart of this season's narratives.

Aside from the school, the series also soars with it's continuing drug lord stories that are so incredibly and horrifically played out. Chased by a brave band of police folk, their interplays with the thriving Baltimore drug scene show the complexity of this issue, much beyond ""Just saying no"". Police politics, and an upcoming mayoral election, prove devastating for ""the Wire"", as the department is gutted and it's staff sent elsewhere. Everyone, and I mean, EVERYONE turns in such an amazing performance, you would have thought that they were born to play these roles.

My head is spinning. I'm now going to start back at season one, and see how this show began, to inform my honored season 4. And I just can't wait.",1206057600,14,2810,4.759753593429158
2855675,5,B000QXDJLI,"I have now watched all four seasons of The Wire out on DVD and am eagerly waiting for the fifth.  This is the best dramatic show on telelvision.  The quality of the writing, directing and acting is excellent.",1206057600,,208,4.447368421052632
2855676,5,B000QXDJLI,"Twenty years ago most cop shows were simplistic tales of good verses evil and to learn about the real world one had to read books. This show however is probably better than any novel that I have read and is a remarkable portrayal of how systems work and fail to work. The systems that are examined are the police system, the school system and the criminal underclass. It is also an indictment on urban decay and how its corruption touches everyone. Even a politician who starts of as seriously motivated to reform a corrupted system.

The first series of the Wire was about a successful police operation which targeted a criminal gang. This series shows how police forces can fail. The way that the drug gangs work in this show (and no doubt in real life)  is that they are hierarchical. Distribution is done by dealers on street corners employing low level operatives. The ones who handle the drugs are under age children who face lower level penalties if caught. The organisation is run by bosses who don't touch the drugs and use enforcers to kill as a means of enforcing discipline and controlling territory.  The easiest targets are the street operatives but their arrest does little to cripple the organisation as there is a reservoir of young people looking to get into the game. Lazy policing targets the street operatives as it leads to arrests but doesn't dent the basic organisation. Successful policing looks at the means of arresting the bosses and enforcers. This of course is infinitely more difficult. The organisational dynamics of the police force are that success is not measured in terms of shattering criminal organisations but in arrest statistics. Thus the police focus on the lower level of the criminal system and are at best an irritant rather than a threat to the criminal gangs.

Series four looks at the education system in a decaying city and how it spawns a cadre of youth keen to go into drug dealing as the one sure career path available to them. How the notion of ""leaving not children behind"" in practice means the rote teaching of exam questions to maintain school funding and the total failure to engage the pupils of the school. The means of viewing the educational system is for the series having a new teacher trying to make a difference and the frustration he faces in trying to make a difference. Whilst he has his little successes it is against the background of a failing system.

In past series the skills of police were on display. In this series a number of the heroes of the past series have been moved out of centre stage and some of the hopeless have been moved forward. A sergeant promoted above his competence is put in charge of a serious drug investigation. His surveillance camera is spotted by its target and the gang leader under surveillance plays games with him setting up a dummy operation were an innocent is arrested. The sergeant moves from one blunder to another losing his camera and then losing focus on doing his job. He is responsible for one of the central tragedies of the series when he carelessly reveals the identity of a 14 year old informant who then becomes the subject of violent reprisals. He also fails to protect another informant who works out his own revenge.

Yet not only is the series a portrayal of the decay of a modern American city it is a drama with realistic and rounded characters whose world the viewer is drawn into.

The last series of the Wire was a little below the high level of the first two series. However this is a blistering return to form and is without doubt some of the greatest television ever made.",1205625600,2,3606,4.660377358490566

I watched the first season...then the second, third, and fourth all within about a month and a half time period.  Season 4 takes a good, hard look at a controversial and disturbing problem within America--the doldrums in which our inner-city school systems currently reside.  After watching certain episodes, I felt hopeless...certainly, David Simon's main concern is not to make his viewers feel like all is well in this world.  Moreover, I've yet to watch a series besides Sopranos that draws you so close to the characters.  Season 2 aside, I've never felt once that any of the characters in the series were actors.

2855699,5,B000QXDJLI,"'The Wire' is one of the few true TV shows about what makes America, AMERICA. It is about the failure of institutions and - more specifically - the ramnifications for the people those institutions have failed. Government, law enforcement, family, and now... education, in the season that made me quite literally sit up, put my head in my hands, pause the show, and try and put into words (unsuccessfully) just how great it is.

And while the fourth season is an OK place for new viewers to jump in, longtime viewers will find this to be the most rewarding of the show's run thus far. Not only has the major crimes unit, the heart of the series, been scattered across the police department, but so, essentially, has the remainder of the Barksdale crew. Marlo Stanfield and his crew, however, are making their play to become kings of the corner, and they're so efficient in their methods that the cops have yet to put a body on 'em.

But the heart of this season is the struggle for four young boys in the Baltimore city school system. One of them has a connection to the Barksdales. Another, Randy Wagstaff, has - I think, anyway - a connection to Prop Joe's people, as he shares a surname with Calvin 'Cheese' Wagstaff, Joe's nephew. Their stories play out and, naturally, dovetail with those of other characters, as it seems only 'The Wire' can make happen.

To see the journey that nearly all of the 'Wire' characters go on this season is truly amazing, and as so often happens in real life, heartbreaking. There are no easy answers; they are no angels or devils... only humans wading through gray in a world that wants them to be black and white.

I'm three episodes into the fifth season - which adds a new failing institution, the media - and I can already see the strings being pulled taut as the series prepares to wrap up.

DO NOT miss out on this show. It isn't just, as creator David Simon says, 'about the America that America forgot.' It's also about the America that did the forgettting, and it's the greatest show on TV, bar none. (And I LOVE 'The Shield,' so that's saying quite a bit)",1202342400,5,2100,4.515789473684211

2855711,5,B000QXDJLI,"HBO is notorious for groundbreaking television series such as Oz, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under. The Wire however, has transcended the quality of television to its highest peak. Although I would never encourage one to choose television over reading literature, in this case I would make a huge exception. In fact, the show has the feel of a great literary novel where the viewer is forced to process the intricate dialogue, and at times adapt to the lingo of street talk and police talk. With every season, the show begins at a slow pace, but with every successive episode, it gains momentum as every character develops and positions itself throughout the show, like a game of chess. Upon superficial glance, The Wire looks like another gritty cops and robbers show such as The Shield or CSI. However, the viewer will see how the Wire through its multi-layered characters, deconstruct the institutions of its society, that being the setting of Baltimore. Creator David Simon picks an institution with every new season, where season 4 explores the education institution (the effects of the `no child left behind' legislation).

Character development is where the Wire is the epitome of brilliance. With its multitude of characters along the social strata ranging from the lowly informant junkie to the sleazy senator of Maryland and everyone else in the middle of this socio-economic spectrum, every character is brilliantly portrayed in a manner that doesn't sink to Hollywood melodrama like Desperate Housewives and Prison Break.  Another point about characterization is that Simon's fearless move to shift its central characters such as McNulty and Daniels to the background and positioned to the center stage, ex-cop now a middle school teacher Pryzbylewski with new characters (4 middle school age kids). Although it was a risky move to shift its characters, it speaks in volumes to Simon's integrity to generate an authentic product.

As I mentioned earlier, Oz, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under were groundbreaking originals in its time, but unlike the above, The Wire continues to perfect its own masterpiece with every successive season!!!!

To conclude, I want to pose a question to any reader who can answer my inquiry as to how is it possible that the Wire with all its acclaim from critics has received next to nothing in the form of Emmy awards. It is this paradox that I struggle to accept.",1200096000,3,2407,5.040201005025126

2855720,5,B000QXDJLI,"There's no point in reading this review- or watching this season of The Wire- without having started at the beginning.  So - to address those who have come this far:  the pace is quite gentle at first, and you may miss some of the key characters from previous seasons, though some of them return- some in unexpected and rather delightful ways.  This season, though, is all about the kids- and there's a lot of time spent at school and in Cutty's boxing gym.  Seriously, all the adult characters apart from Carcetti and Mayor Royce are pretty much bit-part players, though with Carcetti's lapse into cynicism amid fears of losing an election, it somehow seems that Bunny Coleman remains the moral compass of the piece, even though he's no longer a police.  So- it's about the kids- will they stand a chance of a decent life or will the corners claim them?  The young actors are entertaining and gripping in their own way and you already have some ideas as to which characters will end up good and those whose lives will be a Baltimore dead end.
Talking of bit-players, Omar is still with us and is as brilliantly alienated an outsider anti-hero as has even been played in mainstream  TV drama.
Overall, The Wire remains of an impossibly high standard and sets a bar of sorts for all forms of serious art or culture- it's ambitions are huge and it nails every single one of them.",1199232000,,1377,4.573170731707317
2855721,5,B000QXDJLI,This latest season was even more captivating than the last!  I suggest you buy all of the previous seasons... It's the best show I've followed in years!  I can't wait until season 5 starts this month!,1199232000,,200,4.527777777777778
2855722,5,B000QXDJLI,"In this review, I assume you're already familiar with The Wire and are considering whether to continue into the 4th season.  If you're not already familiar with the show, buy (or rent) Season 1 - it's worth it, in fact it's one of the best shows on TV.  The rest of this review focuses on Season 4, and I'll do my best to avoid spoilers.

Season 4 of the wire takes some pretty dramatic turns from the previous 3 seasons, the most notable being the fact that the Barksdale gang is no more.  Bodie and Slim are still around, and even Wee-Bey makes some appearances this season, albeit from prison, but the Barksdale organization has been supplanted by Marlo.

The most interesting aspect of Season 4 is that, similar to how Season 2 focused on the dockworkers, Season 4 takes a very close look at the Baltimore school system (mainly via the eyes of Prez, who is now a teacher).  I know, the subject matter sounds boring but it's actually very well executed, with the focus on a group of young kids (Randy, Dukie, Namond, and Chris) and the pressures they face to get into ""the game"" at a very young age (younger than Bodie or even Wallace in season 1).  In this look into the school system, the social commentary aspect of the series is felt even more than in prior seasons, but it doesn't detract from the drama, if anything it enhances it.

Like the previous three seasons, the characters are excellent.  McNulty's role has been diminished significantly (he's a minor character in season 4, hopefully he'll play a bigger role in season 5), but he's been replaced by some new characters (the aforementioned kids) as well as some existing characters taking on greater roles (Carcetti is now a major character as he runs for mayor against incumbent Royce ... the election is a major facet of the plot this season).  Thankfully, Omar is still around and up to his old habits, and the confrontation between he and Marlo is excellent, but I won't spoil that.

The Bonus Features segment of this set included on disc 4 includes two very interesting mini-documentaries (about a half hour each) entitled ""The Game is Real"" and ""It's All Connected"".  I rarely bother with all the bonus features a lot of DVDs include, but these are worth watching.  I didn't know that the co-creators of The Wire are an ex detective, and an ex journalist (both worked in Baltimore of course), and, not surprisingly, a large amount of the material in The Wire is adapted from real world events.  Also not surprisingly, a large percentage of the men and women who work on the show are not career hollywood/TV types.  The documentaries provide a pretty interesting look at how the creators approach the show and how it has drawn inspiration from real world Baltimore.  Definately check these documentaries out if you buy the DVD set!

In summary, if you've already seen the first three seasons and are considering whether to continue The Wire, the answer is a resounding ""yes"".  In addition, the season ends by setting up for a potentially spectacular Season 5, which I'm really looking forward to.  I've heard that Season 5 will be the last season of The Wire, and while I'll miss it that's ok with me - I'd rather see a great series have a great ending, rather than spiral into a Soprano's style dive in its twilight years.",1199059200,,3296,4.632302405498282

If you live in a city like Oakland, Richmond, East LA, St. Louis, Detroit, etc. you live in a city like Baltimore.  You read of the killings everyday in the newspaper or hear of the shootings on the TV and radio and you wonder why?  The Wire gives a very clear reason on why. The best written story and acting I've seen on TV in years.  Not sure why it doesn't win all of the awards. I guess Hollywood cannot relate to what is real around them.  It gets my award now and for years to come.  I grew up in Richmond, CA and saw the progression of the drug trade and witnessed what it did to people.

2855732,5,B000QXDJLI,"There isn't much I can say about the show because if you follow it, it's like a cigarette addiction you can't kick where every episode is like the puffs after the Thanksgiving Day meal.  If you hate the show, you're likely one of many who can't stomach the show for various reasons; its intelligence, honesty and raw power that oozes talent, sincerity and mastery of a broadcast medium that's long sunk into decadent masturbation.  Perhaps it's best you order the complete season of Friends or some other fantastically shallow show that makes it comfortable to be a simple couch potato who's forgotten that the world can be a little disturbing.

The Wire, since the first season, has been the most amazing show created in a long time.  In classic HBO form, it is very different in the way it stands out for its boldness, risk taking and iconoclast ambitions.  Every season seems to add more power and momentum to the greater themes of generational loss of the struggling people in our society, not only those in social perils, but ones who find themselves ethically and emotionally challenged by the political economic predicaments of the urban world and it's social hierarchy.

The perils, pitfalls and random incidents of modern bureaucratic failures  arrive at perfection in the writing, development, cinematography, and telling of stories all interwoven into a quilt of a collective drama.  No one has ever made a show about middle school children with so much depth and insight.  And this is not some ""Stand By Me"" barf bag of sentimentality that one can only relate to in a romanticized vision of childhood.  No, this is the honest and painful look at the lives of children who are forced to choose the path of lives only to be betrayed with the knowledge that their choices were premade for them and their hopes and innocence were a temporary reprieve from the reality of their urban hostility.

The story is not just Baltimore and the kids there but in all of the broken cities and communities all over this great and terrible country where the currency of hope will never catch the inflation of opportunity.  The story follows a group of 8th grade boys growing up in the dark world that the last 3 seasons have acclimated us for.  One by one, by random accidents or choices, their lives slip deeper into da' game where the cops, bureaucrats, and the street players await to indoctrinate them into the world most of us would prefer not to look.  The show is brilliantly acted and the kids are more than just believable, they're as real as we were at some point in our lives when the veil of innocence was still partially covering our view.

There's never been a show or movie aside from maybe ""Fresh"" that's been able to show us the story behind the induction into the world of street corner drugs, violence, and the thug life that seems to engulf our imagination but not our sympathies.  The Wire delivers this with the hard hitting punch to our teeth with emotionally stirring power that has become the signature of brilliance and horror.  The professional and local cast are seamlessly peppered (sorry Snoop, but girl, you're too flavorful) and are all amazing in the most spell binding storyline that I can only describe as being the greatest modern tragedy ever put on screen.

""Reality TV"" is the fascination and sheer voyeuristic pleasure of watching petty emotional outburst in manipulated circumstances.  There is another reality that exists in the imagination that craves the essential and the necessary; the yearning for a mother's love, a child's hatred that desires murder, the knowledge of good pitted against the instincts to survive, and tragedy of not knowing the high price of exercise choice in  game where everything has consequences.  Such realities are offered in this show, without compromise, without apologies, and without the anesthesia of sentimentality.  Unlike traditional television with its familiar formulas, censored language and condescending themes that make us numb to what is real drama, this is a show that makes us question who we are and what kind of world we live in without allowing us to easily turn our heads away from the hard truth to the easy lie that is the story of America.",1198540800,9,4231,4.839112343966713

2855734,5,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth season continues with the amazingly excellent quality of the previous seasons. The acting is beyond superb - every character is portrayed so well you believe absolutely they exist. The script is perfect, the directing also, settings ... it simply is not to be missed. It's harder to watch than the other seasons, as it has more about the fallout of the drug scene on children and the part about the schools is real (we know well how ""No Child Left Behind"" has decimated what's left of inner city schools and this is an accurate portrayal) and therefore very difficult to watch. However, the outstanding quality of this series is worth it. We still can't believe something this spectacular is happening on television - although it has too much meat for a movie - it really has to be told over several hours and therefore on television - like a good novel written in chapters. With HBO making the bizarre decision to discontinue Deadwood, and the Sopranos having outlived its excellence before finally ending - if you want the best television can offer, this is the place to look for it. We tell everyone we know about it - it deserves to be watched by the biggest audience possible.",1198281600,,1192,4.680952380952381

2855736,4,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is a great program, and I'd definitely recommend seeing the fourth season and the first three as well. It's still among the best and most involving things you can buy, and its comparable to HBO's best, including the Sopranos and Deadwood. And there are plenty of great moments and appealing characters in the fourth season -- Carcetti gets a lot more interesting and his campaign manager is a great character; Senator Clay Davis is funny as hell; Mayor Royce becomes a lot more interesting; there's plenty of Omar (always a good thing); and all of the new kids are great, especially Randy and Namond. Snoop, who carries the opening scene of the series, is great too. Prezbo wonderfully communicates the lost and helpless feeling of a novice teacher in the Baltimore school system. They are all great! One reservation I'd have though -- this show has started to get too preachy. Some of the speeches that Carcetti makes -- some of the speeches that get made in the middle school scenes -- some of the speeches that get made by the U. Maryland education reformers -- really start to get a bit too didactic. I know the show's creators have real situations in mind and want to get them across to the viewers, but they need to dial that stuff back *just a bit.* We get it. That's why we like the show. We don't need to have these points driven home so expressly, so literally. The other extreme, of course, is to become ever more elliptical and cryptic, as the Sopranos did in its later seasons. Its hard to walk the line, but I'm just putting that out there.",1198022400,3,1563,4.546099290780142
2855737,5,B000QXDJLI,"This is the best season of the best show on tv. The first three seasons were amazing, but the fourth, to me, was my favorite so far(the 5th and final season starts next month). Even though I take award shows with a grain of salt, it's criminal that The Wire gets no respect at all from them. I'm really going to miss this show.",1198022400,,327,4.125
2855738,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire is without a doubt the most realistic, daring, dimensional and layered of all of the HBO series. I've loved all of the HBO series, if for no other reason, for their honesty. I don't know if they have more artistic leverage or what, but they seem to be able to take more risks than most other television programs; consequently, character development is especially authentic. While some reviewers were completely turned off by the graphic realism of the characters and stories; having lived in Maryland for a few years, I can fully identify with the accuracy of the character portrayals. Having seen all four seasons, I think what turns some people off about The Wire is the realization that these horrors exist within the borders of arguably the world's richest and most talented nation. It also serves as a source that re-opens the wounds of subject matter long identified as on-going by some and self-imposed by others. And while the true ugliness of city life in Baltimore (or any other city for that matter) has been scaled back for the sake of television, The Wire does an exemplary job of capturing the struggles of life, love and betrayal; both personal and professional, in a politically forgotten, poverty stricken metropolis of American antiquity. By the way, the special features portion is especially revealing. The film, characters and its creators have developed a show that will, if not anything else, force you to ask critical questions pertaining to the implementation of capitalism. BRAVO HBO...BRAVO because this may very well be the best television program of all time!",1197849600,,1597,5.007518796992481

This season in my opinion, is the best so far. There are times during this season where I literally felt heart broken. This show has no signs the fatigue  most shows have at this point. It is still as relevant as ever. It is the best drama ever.",1197590400,,378,3.973684210526316
2855741,5,B000QXDJLI,"For me, the first few seasons of the Wire made for a good, uncensored cop show. But the show started scaling new heights, not just telling the stories of the cops and crooks, but of the schools, politicians and other institutions that surround them. By the time the Wire hit its fourth season, it was no longer a show about drug dealers- it was a show about the city of Baltimore, written by an ex Baltimore homicide cop and schoolteacher, and a former Baltimore journalist. On HBO, they've had the opportunity to tell the full story of their community, without censorship and no holds barred.

I just wanted to write this review to say that this season of this show is without a doubt the best television I have ever seen. It's realistic, gripping, mature, complex, riveting, heartfelt. The depictions of the drug trade that claims so many of Baltimore's inner city children is depressing, but the show also offers hope, finding the joy in life even as it confronts and depicts its darkest depths. I can't recommend this DVD set more.",1197504000,2,1035,4.686813186813187

There was always a great street excitement to it, nods to old west allusions (think of the near-gunfight with Omar in the alley last season with the bow-tie wearing Atlantic Monthly reading gangster from New York). But this year I wonder if they know they are winding down the show (season five will be the last) and so they want to get to the heart of how hopeless this world seems before they're off the air. The stuff in the schools will break your heart, as will the futility of things ever changing. But this is art, and probably the best TV show ever.",1197158400,3,618,4.336206896551724
2855744,5,B000QXDJLI,"Don't worry, the wire is still one of the best shows on television,besides csi & sopranos, but get ready for some changes in Season 4. We see a bit less of some of our cast favorites and focus more on the race for Mayor and on the Baltimore school system.(None of what follows is a spoiler.) Mayor Royce makes a series of mis-steps, alienates the police high command, and gives white guy Tommy Carcetti a real chance of winning. Former cop Prezbuluski is now a school teacher and does his best to keep several new characters in school and off the corners. The major case squad is broken up and the cops are reduced to ""rip and run"" operations against minor drug dealers. Drug kingpin Marlowe may have found a way to get to Omar, who is still ripping off the major dealers. At first, I was a bit disappointed to see so little of the people I wanted to see more of, but then I realized that this show is going all the way - it's not just the cops and the dealers; it is the entire panorama of big city life....and death.

If you love sprawling epic novels like Middlemarch or Bleak House, you'll love the Wire. This is a stunningly intelligent, affectionate, sad, and angry portrait of Baltimore, its diverse citizens, and the institutions that fail them. The fourth season focuses on the (super-segregated) school system and is the best one yet. Its main characters start out as four funny 8th-grade boys in the inner city, and it tracks their perilous journeys into manhood. The adults in their lives are a very mixed bag, and even the well-intentioned ones can't always hold sway over the poverty, violence, and neglect in these children's lives. Everyone in America should watch this season and ask themselves how the richest country in the world can allow such horrors to happen to so many children.

The cast is huge, but my favorite Wire characters include Sgt. Carver, the exasperated cop trying to keep these kids safe and out of trouble; Mr. Prez, their novice, hapless math teacher who eventually learns to teach probabilities by letting the kids play dice; Cutty, the ex-con boxing coach, who tries to teach the boys how to fight with honor; and mayoral candidate Tom Carcetti, a wonderfully complex blend of smarts, sleaze, self-righteousness, and idealism. I can't think of another show with so many well-drawn and interesting characters. This is about as close to great literature as TV can get. Try it, you won't regret it! Tip: If you have trouble following the thick ""Ballmer"" accents, the closed captioning helps a ton.

Examining each link in the drug ""food chain,"" this innovative HBO drama set in the thick of inner-city Baltimore includes everyone from junkies and dealers to cops and politicians. While the third season focused on the investigation of drug kingpin Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris), the show expands to tackle the urban education system's role in fueling the proliferation of drugs. Among the ensemble cast are Dominic West and Frankie Faison.

2855747,4,B000QXDJLI,"If you're reading this, you probably already know how great this show is, so I won't bore you with an episode breakdown. My topic for this review is regarding the packaging. As you may or may not know, previous seasons of The Wire had fancy digipack/book style packaging which may have been part of the reason the old MSRPs were so high. Luckily the MSRP for the new fourth season is lower, but comes with a serious drawback. This season is packaged in slim pack cases, which is fine...if it's done right. I have no problem with the fact that it's a different style and that it doesn't quite match previous seasons. My frustation is due to the fact that the actual slim pack cases do not elevate the discs high enough so they rub on the cases, causing scratches. The first disc in my set has pretty bad circular scratches and I have a feeling it will skip. The other discs are in OK shape (the fourth disc has minor scratches), but chances are you'll end up with at least one scratched disc. They could have avoided this had they just designed the slim packs better. I would rather them keep the cost higher and provide proper storage, rather than treating the discs with such carelessness. This show is too awesome to have it skip on you, and besides...if I pay for a new product, I expect it to look new.

2855751,5,B000QXDJLI,"Season 4 of HBO's The Wire was nothing short of brilliant! This is a masterpiece; a visual novel where seemingly minor points and plots from each season are interwoven to create a complex, yet compelling story. For example, I loved how ""the Greek"" made a reappearance in one episode. I'll spare the season recap so that I do not ruin the experience for the new viewer, although caution, I do have a little spoiler below.

Like most of the other reviews, I agree that The Wire is by far, the absolute best television show, now or past. It puts the Sopranos, The Shield or any other television show to shame. It is intelligent and thought provoking, which is probably why it has never gained the wider audience or awards it deserves.

When the previews for Season 4 were initially released, I had my doubts. After the magnificent ending to Season 3 and the way Stringer was eliminated, I couldn't see how a story focused on the Bawlmore schools could live up.

As with the previous seasons, the story takes a bit of time to develop over the first few episodes. However, as I watched the tragic story of Namond, Michael, Randy, and Dukie unfold, I became yet again glued to my TV every Sunday evening. By the final episode of the season, it was evident that David Simon and Ed Burns had created a brilliant but sad masterpiece of storytelling. Season 4 by far tops the previous three in its power to move the viewer. In the final moment of the final episode, one wonders if Namond has truly escaped from the game.

I can not recommend Season 4 of The Wire enough, unless you first haven't seen Seasons 1 - 3. Without those, you may be a bit lost. Enjoy, but be prepared to be moved. I recently saw the crew doing some filming in suburban Maryland and I am anxiously awaiting the fifth and final season. I highly recommend!",1195257600,4,1819,4.486404833836858

2855753,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Sopranos has been hailed as the sophisticated show to ever grace television, but it doesn't even hold a candle to the Wire.  A devastating, comprehnsive dissection of the decay of American cities and their institutions, the Wire is more comparable to a novel than any other medium.

The fourth season takes on the education system, while still following the drug dealers, cops and politicians from previous seasons.  And, moreso than past seasons, the results are devastating.",1194912000,3,480,5.207792207792208
2855754,5,B000QXDJLI,"For the few people with open minds and good taste that have discovered ""The Wire"", I'm not going to continue to extoll it's virtues and throw out the ""best show ever"" line, as everyone who has had the chance to view any season in it's entirety already knows it truly is that.  This program has ruined me for network television, and has made me a true believer in HBO(hopefully they will continue to hit their water marks).
  All other crime dramas(law and order, CSI, etc.) seem postured, synthetic, and laughable.  No other program I've seen can or has illustrated the sociological turmoil and the despair within gut-wrenching drama, storytelling and brilliant dialogue like this.  But like all good things, this too must come to pass.  David Simon and co. have steadfast plans to end the saga after five seasons.  The fifth season I believe will start in Jan. 2008.
  No matter how good the show is, no matter how many people it has touched, no matter how much money HBO gives them for another season, it will not continue.  At first I was deeply saddened, but at least the show will go out on it's highest note, and will remain totally flawless(the fifth season is going to be the best, and most hard-hitting).

  For the last five to six years ""The Wire"" has been the best kept secret in broadcasting.  Like everything that is truly good in todays culture, it is criminally ignored except for the few people who have the patience to sift through the detritis that is modern-day tv.
  History of course, always reveals qualty to the masses, and I feel that it is an impossibility that this secret will forever remain a secret.  Years down the road, it will become a fixture in it's field; an icon of quality. I like the fact that ""The Wire"" has spread by almost total word of mouth through intelligent circles; That it has remained pure and un-exploited; that it hasn't become a fixture in pop-culture; that ignorant people ignore it to watch the meaningless, propagandized, consumer-driven schlock that is mainstream television; that it hasn't been reduced to an edited and ""Family-friendly"" form to be horribly misread; that the privelaged few who have seen any season of it recognize quality and perfection.
  But ""The Wire"" has achieved more than perfection, as the first season was definitely that.  Every season just gets better and better, and how do you surpass the status of perfection?  What on earth do you call it? That's easy.  You call it ""The Wire""",1194825600,13,2466,4.73943661971831
2855755,5,B000QXDJLI,"The fourth season of 'the wire' sets a new standard for literature. This isn't just  the best show on television, it's right up there with the top titles in drama of all time. You either have to know inner city life intimately or you have to know your literature; for those in the latter category it might take all four seasons to fill you in on the venacular, but like shakespeare, once you fill it, you will be forever affected. If you are in the former category, you'll know how close this show gets to  reality. For those in both categories: you must watch this show.

Time and again HBO surprises with making even better shows but for now, this is the best. Us European taxpayers pay our state sponsored television organisations billions to produce this kind of television, but we never even remotely get this quality. For what I'm concerned I'd rather spend that money buying these kinds of HBO shows.",1194652800,12,907,4.58641975308642

2855762,5,B000QXDJLI,"It's criminal the amount of people that watch the best drama on television, ""The Wire."" I started watching because of David Simon. The man wrote the book that ultimately became my favorite TV show of all time, ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" I quickly became a huge fan, and theres a number of reasons why.

The writing for ""The Wire"" is nothing short of incredible. It's not written by ""TV Writers"" but more experienced authors and this makes quite a difference. A season of The Wire unfolds like a great novel. As each episode goes by, the greater the story builds. Its full of amazing characters and has many special touches and little nuances that are a joy to watch. The cast is fantastic and all the actors do a wonderful job.

I think what many people tend to miss is the importance of the storylines and the issues that David Simon and his team are addressing. In season 3 the storyline of Major Bunny Colvin ""decriminalising"" drugs in a certain area of his district was an amazing look at the world of crime and drugs. It was such an incredible storyline, because it wasn't black and white. An amazing hypothetical that leaves me thinking to this day.  This season they tackle the school system with even greater nous and intelligence.

The Wire is television at its very best, it also demands a lot from the viewer. It's definitely worth repeat viewing of the episodes. If you put the time in to notice the detail of the show it is extremely rewarding. The intricate storylines, complex characters, and revealing insights into life and institutions are waiting for your viewership. Season 4 of The Wire is the greatest season of the show.  Following the four young children throughout the season was truly heartbreaking.  If ever you wanted to own a show on DVD it's this one.  This will go down in history as one of the greats.",1189814400,7,1838,4.619631901840491
2855763,5,B000QXDJLI,"Despite having a small - but loyal - viewer ship, HBO keeps supporting this series.  The Wire is not easy at first - until you really get into it.  It's like a novel - you need time to relate to and understand the characters and story lines.  It's important to watch this series in sequence.  If you come in half way though, it will be very hard to get the most from the stories.  DVD is probably the best way of viewing the Wire.

I loved the first season of the Wire.  Omar in particular is a great character.  But they all are.  McNulty - that main character is probably my least favorite.

Season 2 was not as compelling.  The port theme was interesting, but I don't know.  I just didn't really find it as absorbing.

Season 3 - back into the season 1 storyline.  A great season.  The best of the first 3 probably.  Great twists and turns, and some really surprising turns of event.

Then comes season 4.  Very different from the others.  Based around city politics and the school system.  Season 4 was simply ones of the best pieces of television drama - ever.  The characters, the boys and their struggles, the race for Mayor.  I am looking forward to seeing it again on DVD so much.

Like the other reviewers, I also hope they keep on making the Wire.  I know they are doing season 5 - and HBO would usually wait for season 5 to start on the air before releasing season 4.  HBO must be wanting cash flow, having screwed up its schedule so badly - and canceling Deadwood and Rome (a***oles).  Let's hope they do season 6  and 7 and 8 and more ...

HBO also decreased the prices of the Wire DVDs.  If you have not seen the Wire -- take the opportunity.  If you have seen it, this will just be old news.",1189814400,4,1707,4.211180124223603

8198019,5,B000QXDJLI,"The Wire (2002-2008) is excellent. It paved the way for an even better drug crime show, Breaking Bad (2008-2013).

Most people are aware of corporate espionage and what some companies will do to protect their secrets. In the TV show Breaking Bad the two main characters, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, possess the knowledge and skill to produce the best meth on the market. And their brand is easily identifiable by its unique blue color.

Several competing criminal organizations buy their services and try to replicate their product but Whites and Pinkmans skill in the art and science of making their blue meth product isn't easily duplicated. One group tries to hold Pinkman hostage in Mexico because their highly trained scientists cant make meth as well as he does. Near the end of the series another criminal group keeps Pinkman chained in their lab and force him to make meth for them because their guy, who worked with both White and Pinkman, is unable to duplicate Pinkmans and Walter Whites skill in the art and science of making their blue meth brand.

Breaking Bad has one of the best story and character arcs ever used in a TV show, which is why it has an IMDb rating of 9.5, right up there with Game of Thrones, another great show. The Wire (2002-2008) was as good as the Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014), but not as good as Breaking Bad. I won't give away the ending of Breaking Bad, but if you watch the complete series, from the first episode to the last, the ending will make complete sense and be very satisfying. Its terrific.

If the above series don't sound interesting here are a few of the series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2634,5.073903002309469
