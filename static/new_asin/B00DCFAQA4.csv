8591789,5,B00DCFAQA4,"Great Shipper, arrived quickly in perfect condition !  Thank you !
Truman Madsen's video, The Eternal Christ is another amazing work by this incredible man..
He did this on location in Israel, and actually lived there many years and totally knows the people, their history, and the culture..
He goes to many of the places in Israel that are in the maps in the King James version of the Bible, and talks about the Savior's life in each of them..
Truman Madsen had the most perfect, soothing, voice and delivery on all his video works and this one is no exception..  Done perfectly, in natural light or by candle light of that time, that is still used today..
You will notice that Truman Madsen used no script, notes, teleprompter, and just spoke from his incredible intellect, his experiences, and his most beautiful heart..
I will never tire of watching these dvd's forever...",1522800000,,876,4.756578947368421

8591797,5,B00DCFAQA4,"If you have never purchased or heard Truman Madsen speak you need too, and this is the one! This is the perfect gift for those who want to know about the life of Christ.  Truman Madsen takes you through the cities and places that Christ walked and tells you in detail all of what was and probably took place because of tradition at that time.  His knowledge is astounding and the pictures beautiful!  I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to know more about the life of Christ.",1335830400,4,488,4.4
8591798,5,B00DCFAQA4,"This video series by the late Truman Madsen is a beautiful look at the Holy Land and the life of Jesus Christ. Dr. Madsen relates stories from the New Testament and the life of Christ videoed where they happened. For instance, he tells the story of Christ walking on the water from a ship on the Sea of Galilee. Each section is beautifully photographed and deeply spiritual. Although this series is not a production of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Dr. Madsen is a devout member of the Church. I think most any believer in Christ would benefit from watching these videos. If there are some who feel that the LDS Church is not a Christian church, I doubt that they could hold that view after watching this series. If there are some who do not believe in Jesus Christ, I feel this series has the power to change doubt into belief.

I humbly request that in response to this review no one criticize Dr. Madsen, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or this review until they have watched this powerful series of videos. At that time and only at that time would a response to my review be appropriate.",1282521600,18,1126,4.492682926829269
