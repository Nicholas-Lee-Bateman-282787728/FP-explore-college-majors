8176824,5,B000NDEWG2,"Great Movie, reminds me of my youth !  Language is Serbian with English subtitles.  However, DVD format is European PAL, not compatible with US standard. And not disclosed in the Amazon listing!  I was able to watch it through my laptop, connected to TV.  Movie resolution is poor, but as I said it reminded me when I watched it first in my youth!  So I liked it.  By today's standards is probably way to slow and not very exciting.",1524009600,,432,4.405063291139241
8176825,5,B000NDEWG2,"Excellent film , raw and  insightful drama, no glossing over the impoverished social reality... with fantastic authentic Gypsy music that originates from the northern village of  Vojvodina. Very  creative cinematography and direction.
The DVD quality is good, the subtitles are adequate could probably benefit with an up-grade from Second Run or Criterion... but highly recommended.",1442880000,,382,5.909090909090909
8176826,5,B000NDEWG2,"Much darker than I remembered, but a clear-eyed, unflinching examination of gypsy life in Bulgaria.  Lead player Bekim Femhu is powerful and believable, had quite a career, as I recall.",1413763200,,185,5.166666666666667

8176828,5,B000NDEWG2,Aleksandra Petrovic's classic has long been neglected so it's a thrill to find this DVD issue. The subtitles are clear and the transfer is excellent.,1394928000,3,149,5.0
8176829,5,B000NDEWG2,"""Happy Gypsies"" is a bleak look at what life for Roma people in former Yugoslavia was really like. A useful corrective to those romantic notions about dancing around campfires, singing the days away.",1338249600,5,199,5.0606060606060606
