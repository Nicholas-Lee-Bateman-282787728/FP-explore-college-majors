7882934,2,6305112339,"First of three feature length movies that were adapted from the popular British 1970's sitcom and is easily the best. The film is entertaining along the way but again it comes across as one long ponderous extended T.V sketch. The basic plot line revolves around a bunch of women bus drivers causing the male bus drivers outrage with the men believing that women are not up to being bus drivers. Ususal double entrendes and comic misunderstanding but the sexist treatment of the script handicapps the film slightly with it coming across as very dated. However Reg varney and Anna karen sparkle in their roles and have some of the funniest lines to deliver. Apart from that it's enjoyably about average. If you asked me the same question about 15 years ago, I would have said excellent, but it's now just innocent, old fashioned fun and games. Recommended to fans of the series.",992476800,,876,4.769736842105263
7882935,4,6305112339,"This was the first British TV comedy to be made into a full length feature film. It has all the ingredients not to be politically correct, but it is classic comedy. The Inspector (Blakey) decides to take on women bus drivers to help the short staffed Luxton and District Bus Company. No overtime for the male bus crews means plans are afoot to cause problems for Blakey and the women drivers. The film has some of the best gags in it from the classic TV Series. On The Buses fan club is alive and well.",980035200,,502,4.294736842105263
7882936,3,6305112339,"This is the first of three films made after the success of the television series. The Town and District bus depot has a shortage of Bus crews, the depot inspector decides the only sollution is to employ female bus drivers.  This causes hilarious results with the male staff. Stars Reg Varney as  Stan, Bob Grant as Jack, Stephen Lewis as Inspector Blake and Doris Hare as  mum.",958694400,,377,4.597014925373134
