8257435,2,B00153ZQPK,"I couldn't sit through this movie with my kids.  They thought it was okay, but prefer Sonic X. These are grainy and poorly written.  I can usually sit through about anything, but I only lasted 10 minutes on this one.  I would recommend the Sonic X movies as they are better quality, more exciting and overall easier to watch.",1282694400,,325,4.47457627118644
8257436,5,B00153ZQPK,"Don't be fooled by the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" cover art. This DVD does consist of 4 ""The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" episodes making up the entire Chaos Emerald story arch. Personally, it was a blast seeing these episodes again (last I had seen them I was probably 10 years old; 13 years ago!). These four episodes are notable in that they are some of the better animated episodes in the series in terms of plot and the actual animation. For kids or young adults that grew up with the series, you can't go wrong this cheap DVD.",1231200000,5,531,4.428571428571429
