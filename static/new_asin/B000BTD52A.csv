8092229,5,B000BTD52A,This is a must buy for any Liverpool FC supporter and gives a brief history of the most successful British football club with some of the Anfield legends greatest goals.,1185580800,,169,4.666666666666667
8092230,3,B000BTD52A,"This is an excellent source of historical information (although not up to date), well edited and produced but not the whole story, not by a long shot even. The magic of Anfield's moments of glory comes from many many moments strung together by the golden thread of destiny, these moments were not covered in their entirity. So for this to be a definitive history of the phenomenon that is Liverpool F.C., more work is needed on this aspect; more footage and more analysis of the conditions surrounding and unfolding within pivotal matches in each season. An update that includes the unique achievement of a 5th UEFA champions cup (maybe a 6th this year), and more focus on the central figures of that amazing 70's team as well as current stars.",1168041600,4,744,4.730769230769231
8092231,4,B000BTD52A,"The title says it all.  This is a must for fans of soccer.  Liverpool, the most successful club in English football, and one of the most successful in le monde.  Gives a thorough background; goes through all the periods and all the `Pool legends.

The one thing missing, and it should come out is a new release is the great Champions League win over AC Milan in 2005.",1167868800,,367,4.352941176470588
