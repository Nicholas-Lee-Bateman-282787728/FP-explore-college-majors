7988444,5,B000090W7F,"This is a great and moving video of a World War I hero and his visit to the battlefields he fought on.  It is a heartfelt movie about his returning to the towns he was involved with during the great war and how the current townsfolk welcomed him as the hero he was as he revisited the places of the war.  This is a ""must have"" for any history buff and those of us who are veterans.",1338768000,,381,3.935064935064935
