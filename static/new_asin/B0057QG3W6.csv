4597685,5,B0057QG3W6,"From the man who brought us the mouth watering ""Fish Fry Night In Milwaukee"" comes his latest & lip smacking best ""Wisconsin Supper Clubs: An Old Fashioned Experience"".  Its purpose is to give an overview of some of the best Supper Clubs around the state of WI & to try to explain it's culture.  Whether you're new to the subject or not it's a fascinating film to watch.  You can view it as pure nostalgia for a different time.  You can view it as a wonderful scenic overview of what makes Wisconsin great.  You can view it as a ""David vs Goliath"" type tale.  Whatever you do...just view it!  This would make a great gift...especially for displaced Wisconsinites longing for home.",1309219200,13,680,4.570247933884297

8461082,5,B0057QG3W6,"I expected an educational documentary of limited appeal, but it was very entertaining with professional production values. I liked the personal interviews especially, which had none of the feel of some poorly shot youtube video as I had feared. Well worth watching by any travel or history buff.",1462838400,,295,5.166666666666667

tribute to the Wisconsin supper clubs higlighted in the book, also by
Ron Faiola. Both of Ron's books are very good reading and informative.

and amazon offer good service! Great stuff and I highly recommend it!",1392940800,3,348,4.4375
