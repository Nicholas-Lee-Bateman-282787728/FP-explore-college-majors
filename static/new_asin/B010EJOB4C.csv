7310420,5,B010EJOB4C,"As 'Haven' will end after the upcoming ten episodes of S5 V2, I needed to add S5 V1 to complete my collection. The BR discs all read typically with no problems. The photography was typically great and the special effects were quite good, too. Complete your collection - and, like me, await the unannounced series final collection - S5 V2. One question remains unanswered; why is there a S5 V1 & 2 instead of S5 & S6?",1443744000,,416,4.415584415584416

7310425,4,B010EJOB4C,"Haven: Season 5, Volume 1,"" based on the Stephen King novella The Colorado Kid, follows former FBI agent Audrey Parker (Emily Rose), who became a cop in the small town of Haven, Maine, and quickly found herself involved in the return of The Troubles, a series of supernatural afflictions that have plagued the seaside village for generations. Partnered with local residents Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant) and Duke Crocker (Eric Balfour), Audrey began to realize that Havens fate was linked to her own, and only she can save the town and the people she loves from the weight of their curses.

Season Five picks up with the aftermath of the victory over William. After having successfully banished him into the Void, Nathan and Duke are devastated to discover that the Audrey they know and love has disappeared. In her place stands Mara, the malevolent original person responsible for creating the troubles many centuries ago. Mara proceeds to unleash a wave of chaos over Haven.

This Sy-Fy Channel series departs considerably from the King original but does offer some nice mystery and eerie goings-on. Theres a creepy sense of foreboding, thanks to the direction, and its nice to see a central character whos an intelligent woman.

Bonus extras on the 4-disc Blu-ray release include13 Inside Haven featurelettes, audio commentary, and 2 featurettes on the shows origins.",1441843200,14,1370,5.107142857142857

I enjoyed the series so much more when the three main characters were friends with attitudes.  When there was a really odd trouble every week and not stuck on one arc.  the same problem ruined the x files for me.  instead of a quirky episode every week, they got stuck on aliens and it got boring.",1467763200,,587,4.586538461538462

What I didn't see coming was the absence of a season 5 part TWO!  I guess we're expected to buy part 1 twice by purchasing the complete season 5.  I'm not doing it!  The heck with the rest of the season in light of this cheat!  If this is remedied somehow, I'll buy the missing half, but my regard for whoever did this is somewhere in the cellar.

dump the good shows and keep the lame ones on..........but this series is one of the best they've every had
on their network. I'm been watching the channel since day one and Haven is one of those special shows where
the writing, acting, directing, sets (location), props...you name it.........they ALL mesh together so brilliantly and beautifully
that you want to watch and re-watch it over and over again. I only wish a streaming service (perhaps Amazon) would pick
it up and continue with it. Five seasons wasn't long enough and the concept was so memorable that you just KNEW you
could get another 5 seasons out of it. Plus it's hard to say goodbye to these magnificent actors. I know we'll see them in future
projects but they will always be our beloved Haven residents and treat yourself to any and ALL of these DVDs or streaming for this

The reason I am giving low scores for these series is because it has become acceptable in the movie industry to stop selling a season on one set of discs. The new money making screw job is to split a single season into volume one and volume two. This way they can double what they make on DVD releases. Any new series that do two DVD's in a split season, I am boycotting. You can all imagine the language I want to use. We as a driving force need to step up and say its unacceptable to screw us and charge us twice for the same series,.

Wonderful show and I can't fault it's production values, actors or story lines...I love it.  But having gotten us used to 13 episodes for $30 the studio just couldn't bring themselves to give us a full fifth season of 26 (if indeed the second half is 13 as well)  without jacking up the price and breaking up the season.  I pooh pooh them!!!  I also remind consumers that money talks and there WILL be a full series set at a lower price (knowing fully well that that doesn't help us loyal fans who bought season by season).",1445558400,4,633,4.330508474576271
7310553,5,B010EJOB4C,"I absolutely LOVED the first half of Season Five!

Emily Rose really shines in the dual role of Audrey and Mara (I still get chills when I hear/think about Mara's cackle). In Season One, Emily was a little shaky, and I wasn't quite certain if I could like the show with her as a lead. But halfway through that season she found her footing and hooked me--now it's my favorite show on tv.

I do love Nathan :) He's a great character, and he says so much with so few words. Though I will be honest and admit that I've never seen him as ""the one"" for Audrey, but I've learned to love them as a pair and made peace with the fact that they are a couple.

Duke. His character arc has been amazing, and watching Eric Balfour take Duke from Season One to Season Five has been a true gift. Duke's character growth has been far above every other character on the show and all I can hope is that it pays off when the series wraps.

Vince, Dave, Gloria, and Dwight are wonderful to watch as well! Dwight really seems to be stepping up his game in this last season and I can't wait to see where he goes. Gloria, of course, is always a delight to have on screen. And I love that Vince and Dave really have a storyline now in Season Five--those two are magic in their roles.

Charlotte is an interesting character. I'm not sure how I feel about her but she's a nice addition, and I love her chemistry with Dwight.

Overall, the first half of Season Five was terrific! It introduced new levels of troubles and darkness in Audrey/Mara and Duke, and gave Nathan/Dwight/Dave/and Vince new storylines that really made the actors shine. I'm going to be so sad to see the show end, but if Season 5B is anything like the first half, the writers will do this show justice.",1445472000,5,1747,4.278787878787878

7310559,5,B010EJOB4C,"I've been a ""Haven"" fan since the first episode because it features sassy writing mixed with a nice blend of humor, danger and some truly interesting characters.
That said, I was unsure if Season Five would live up to the previous four given the revelation that Audrey Parker - who has spent most of the series trying to save both the town and its inhabitants - was actually the cause of Haven's ""Troubles.""
I needn't have worried for this chapter in the Haven saga features the same high-quality writing and plotting as the previous seasons. In addition, Season Five gives Emily Rose a chance to really show off her acting chops while playing a dual role. In the previous four seasons she is sweetly sexy. In this season, as Audrey's alter ego, she is smoldering and dangerous to boot.
As always, this is not just Audrey Parker's show; the supporting cast has plenty of screen time and Haven's writers have given them ample opportunity to flesh out their characters. I especially liked what they did with Duke's character in this season.
Season Five is, in my opinion, a great addition to the Haven saga.",1444867200,10,1105,4.701030927835052
