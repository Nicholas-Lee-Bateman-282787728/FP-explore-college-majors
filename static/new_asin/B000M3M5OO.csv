8166145,5,B000M3M5OO,If you want to understand the true status of Christians in Arab countries you will find a wealth of information in this DVD. Many interviews with the Christian victims of Muslim hate. A great deal of information put together in a compelling manner. I've seen all of Pierre Rehov's documentaries and each one is a must see. Check out his other documentaries too. This one is of particular interest for Christians because it shows how Islam treats Christians whether Arab or not. Anyone whether Christian or Jewish will gain new insights. Muslims should see this too if they ever wish to have a peaceful Islam or are thinking of leaving Islam entirely.,1392076800,,650,4.8125
8166146,5,B000M3M5OO,"This is an excellent documentary about the April 2002 terrorist hostage crisis at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, and records the experiences of  more than 100 priests and other hostages held during that time.

Also shown are the physical destruction and desecration that the gun-wielding Palestinian ""victims"" wrought on the holy site.

The film also includes very revealing interviews with Christians in Bethlehem and elsewhere in the PA, who fear for their lives, and grieve over the Palestinian harassment and oppression that has caused them to fee in record numbers from their ancient homes.

Bethlehem, not long ago 80 percent Christian, is now less than 20 percent Christian, thanks to intimidation, assaults, rapes and other brutality targeting them. And from 20 percent of the area's population after World War II, the Christian population of the Palestinian Authority has now dwindled to 1.7 percent.

As these Christian interview subjects make clear, the cause of this Christian exodus is the Islamist Palestinian Authority, and no one else.
