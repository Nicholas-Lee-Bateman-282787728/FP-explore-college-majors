6319322,5,B00J2T1856,"That HAS to be their premise, ESPECIALLY if we are talking about witty shows that do not rely upon sex and gore, but on great characters, great dialogue and great plots.
This show was witty.  It was a completely unlikely, wholly ridiculous idea that somehow was ...MAGIC.
And CBS yanked it PURELY because of expense because the reality show age was coming and they were canceling good series because reality shows are pure profit.
If they are so into profit, somebody should RENT a brain cell (because it's obvious none of the 'suits' OWN any!), LOOK at the GLOBAL reviews for this show and put it on DVD.
Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.....",1300924800,6,644,4.908256880733945
6319323,5,B00J2T1856,"Remember when Bravo would do those mini-series on Sundays ? They would show about 3 or 4 episodes in a row. What a shame. CBS 1st put the show on Friday nights, which are a killer of anything worthwhile. They also skipped some episodes during the Holiday Season, to show Charlie Brown, and Rudolph that screwed its chances of ever sustaining a regular audience.

I agree with many of the above reviewers. This show was about Mr Wiseman/Newman's love for his family more than his new Government Agent ID and abilities. That was always 2ndary to the story. It was done brilliantly and lovingly. The cast was PERFECT. Eric Close was incredible as our super-hero, but he was also tender as the longing husband & father. He captured the essence of what was necessary to portray this complex character. I was happy he did find a place on another show, but he should have been on NOW AND AGAIN for 4 or 5 seasons (at least) and taken home a couple of Emmy Awards for it.

I can't wait for someone to get the good notion to put this series out on DVD. PLEASE DO IT CBS !",1298246400,8,1062,4.358585858585859
6319324,5,B00J2T1856,"Seems like i have been looking for this DVD for years now.  Hated it was so very good and ended on a fantastic cliffhanger, then dropped by the studio.  For those of us who are fans, come on and at least release a DVD of the series.  Would love to know if they had any more episodes filmed???  It's one of those shows i'm NOT going to forget, but seems i will have to just rely on memories now :(

It was a crime that they cancelled it and that cliffhanger - unbelievable!!!",1265587200,35,287,4.607843137254902
6319326,5,B00J2T1856,"My favorite aspect of this series was the enduring love Michael has for his wife and child.  Normally on shows today, the guy is portrayed as relieved to be rid of his former life.  I always wanted Michael to be reunited with his family.  At least the cliffhanger ending had them fleeing together -- even if Lisa and Heather did not know the man they were running out the door with was Michael.",1250726400,5,394,4.36986301369863

I mean, he was a teenager and I was a middle aged mother, but that hour every week brought us so close together that we often speak of the show and our addiction to it even now. We both wait with bated breath for the e mail informing us it is available on DVD.",1242345600,17,424,4.096385542168675
6319328,5,B00J2T1856,"NOW AND AGAIN came out in 1999, the same time that the ABC family drama ONCE AND AGAIN debuted, and I remember that in the first two or three weeks of that fall season I used to get the two titles mixed up. But, as good as ONCE AND AGAIN was, NOW AND AGAIN was the one I really ended up looking forward to watching week after week. This was creator/writer/producer Glenn Gordon Caron's baby and, as apropos of the guy responsible for REMINGTON STEELE and MOONLIGHTING, NOW AND AGAIN, airing on CBS, was graced with humanity, great storytelling and terrific whimsy. Once again, though, it became yet another case of a major network giving up on a really promising show before the show could find its audience. I remember how very angry I was when NOW AND AGAIN got cancelled.

The premise is this: John Goodman plays New York insurance agent and devoted family man Michael Wiseman who, in the pilot ep, dies in a subway train accident. Exit John Goodman. Except that the U.S. government then takes Michael Wiseman's brain and secretly implants it in a young bio-engineered body (Eric Close of DARK SKIES, WITHOUT A TRACE). And, suddenly, Michael has the ""the speed of Michael Jordan, the strength of Superman and the grace of Fred Astaire."" The Six Million Dollar Man treatment doesn't at all sit well with Michael - who now has a new identity as Mr. Newman. All he wants to do is get back to his devastated wife and daughter. But the government has plans for Mr. Newman, intending to turn him into its secret weapon - and so contact with his old family is strictly prohibited. Wiseman's main watchdog is the imperious Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert), who performed the experimental brain transplant and who heads up this very top secret government project. To clue in folks who hadn't ever eyeballed this series, the quirky tug-of-war relationship between the doctor and his willful test subject provides some of the show's most terrific moments.

Dennis Haysbert (24, THE UNIT and, of course, those All State Insurance ads) exudes such presence. His Dr. Morris is written as a complex enough character that most times I felt quite ambivalent about him - is he a bad guy, Newman's eventual pal, a domineering egotist, what? And, as a bonus, with his deep and imposing voice, Haysbert also treats us to some very good singing. The central role of Michael Wiseman/Newman is played by a tremendously-in-shape Eric Close, and he gives as good as he gets in his exchanges with Haysbert. Eric's performance lends his character that needed weight and maturity, making us believe that there really is a more mature brain housed in that 20-something-year-old secret agent body. What makes Michael and Dr. Theo's interactions so compelling is that Michael never for a moment allows the high and mighty Dr. Theo to dismiss him as a mere laboratory experiment.

Under Dr. Theo's supervision Michael is frequently restricted to quarters and forced to undergo an ongoing series of rigorous training and testing. Seems like we see the man being examined and prodded more so than we see him out in the field. So one more element that may have turned off potential viewers is that not every episode is action-packed. Mr. Newman isn't always in the middle of a mission as the show chooses to focus more on characterization and exploring the various relationships. Which was fine by me. One of the things I liked best about NOW AND AGAIN was the wistfulness evoked. Michael Wiseman may be in a young new body and may suddenly have all these superhuman abilities, but, at heart, the guy hasn't changed. At his core, he's a family man desperately in love with his wife, his daughter and his former life (to quote or maybe paraphrase the opening credit sequence). Each episode demonstrates his constant pining for what he'd lost, with Eric Close simply marvelous and very heartfelt in these yearnful moments.

The show frequently checks in on Wiseman's grieving widow Lisa (Margaret Colin) and his precocious, awkward daughter Heather (Heather Matarazzo) as they try to move on with their lives. Both these actresses - but especially Margaret Colin - are wonderful and lend solid forms to Wiseman's vision of his dream family. Also rounding out the key supporting cast is Wiseman's fussy but likeable best friend Roger Bender (Gerrit Graham). The neat thing for hopeless romantics like me (and, hopefully, you) is that, even though Wiseman is supposed to stay away from his old life at all costs, well, dude doesn't. Not only does he touch base with his buddy Roger, but those who regularly tuned in to these episodes were soon treated to moments brimming with romantic tension and anticipation as Wiseman begins to interact with his wife and with his daughter, against Dr. Theo's express wishes. Except that only Roger knows who Mr. Newman truly is (Lisa and Heather think Michael and Theo are IRS agents). And, then, is it really so strange or surprising that, despite still mourning her dead husband, Lisa Wiseman should find herself attracted to the much younger Mr. Newman? No, right?

I did mention that this show has an element of whimsy, of quirkiness. In Wiseman's fledgling secret agent career, he gets caught up in his share of odd, surreal pickles - whether it's a case featuring spontaneous human combustion, a wave of fearlessness affecting New Yorkers that results in recklessness and fatalities, or a plague that erases the words off books, leaving behind only blank pages.

All the episodes are very good, so it's really hard picking out favorites. I really like the first three episodes: ""Origins,"" ""On the Town"" and ""Over Easy."" Note that ""On the Town"" has Michael escaping confinement and accidentally running into Lisa. Lisa instantly thinks he's some kind of homeless stalker but also senses something familiar about him. ""On the Town"" is also one of the funniest episodes of the season, thanks largely to Roger's assumption that Michael has returned from the dead, only reincarnated. These first three episodes also introduce the Eggman, an old, innocuous-looking Asian guy whose expertise lies in biological terrorism. The Eggman would also reappear in the season/series finale ""The Eggman Cometh,"" thus qualifying him as a recurring antagonist. My two cents is that, had the series gone on, the Eggman would've developed into an awesome villain; he is such an atypical Big Bad. And, for some reason, the episode ""Pulp Turkey"" also immediately springs to mind. This one has Michael and Dr. Theo having Thanksgiving dinner at Lisa and Heather's house and they end up foiling a home invasion.

Very much like POPULAR, one of its contemporaries and yet another gone-too-soon series, NOW AND AGAIN frustratingly ends on an unresolved cliffhanger, as things come to a head between Michael and Dr. Theo and between Michael and his family. As the years keep on passing, I've given up hope for even a follow-up TV movie, and I'm resigned to there not ever being a resolution to the cliffhanger story. The aggravating thing is that the networks haven't learned their lesson; good shows keep on getting kicked to the curb (JERICHO, ELI STONE and PUSHING DAISIES being the most recent casualties).

NOW AND AGAIN had that perfect blend: amazing cast chemistry and wonderful elements of romance, comedy, pathos, and sci-fi adventure. Even the theme song hooked you in with its catchy groove. And since I'm pouring it on with the mad love, let me also mention that this series oozed creativity, wit and unpredictability. All this, apparently, making up the recipe for too much of a good thing.

6319329,5,B00J2T1856,"Over many years of TV disappointments with series canceled too soon, this is the one I miss the most - wonderful cast, wonderful characters, interesting and thought-provoking stories, comedy and true heartfelt drama - I loved this series. I agree completely with the reviewer who said Eric Close was better used in series before Without a Trace, and I think this was the best, closely followed by The Magnificent Seven. 'Now and Again' was also where I first became a fan of Dennis Haysbert - before 24 or The Unit.",1237161600,17,515,4.733333333333333
6319330,5,B00J2T1856,This show offered a younger Eric Close (who was in a number of series I liked much better before landing his current long-standing role in Without a Trace) playing a man who held the essence of the deceased John Goodman. Once you got past this premise the show held its own special magic. Some episodes were better scripted than others but the character development was amazing and the desire of the deceased to watch over his wife and daughter from his prior life was bittersweet. The actor who played the president on 24 and who is now in The Unit played the role of the shadowy scientist.  All-in-all it deserves a look if you liked the shows mentioned by the other reveiwer. I look forward to watching it again.,1224028800,23,715,4.542635658914729

I was a fan of Eric Close, Dennis Haysbert, Margaret Colin, Gerrit Graham, and even John Goodman, and became a fan of Chad Lowe. (He was so nasty.) However, I really the drama and dilemma that Glenn Gordon Caron proposed. I was unsure of how they would continue to involve Michael Newman/Wiseman with his former wife, family and friends, but I was willing to wait. Later, I enjoyed Medium, until the very last show which I hated, but I think Caron might have devised enough plots to continue several seasons of Now and Again.",1484784000,,632,4.504347826086956

I  thought I had fond memories of the series and remembered it was an action show with some warm and and funny moments with his situation and family.  Sadly, I fear my memory tricked me.  There is way too much about his situation and banter with Dennis Haysbert (including singing songs) and corny slapstick with other cast members along with way too much family.  There is very little action even though the few bad guys could have been developed into some great plots for action - if you blink or look away their screen time is so short you will miss seeing them.  By the time they show up later you have forgotten who they are and what they had planned.  Sometimes it seems the writers didn't care and the bad guys just fade away.  The final episode is a cliffhanger, but again, very little is seen of the bad guy.",1466726400,,923,4.3882352941176475

I loved this show back when it aired, and we quite sad that it did not do better. I am making some family members watch this and they love it.  The show is most assuredly a 90's show even though it was late 90's (1999).  The transfer to DVD is as a good as one can hope, but the case with it's blue ""hue"" cover could probably be done better.  The media insert used is also blue when you find it on the web, or the website, but it lacks pop.  Bad choice.  It was also cool to see some of my favorite actors ""before"" they were cool.

At least they leave it in a hopeful place rather than an absolute cliffhanger as some networks irresponsibly do these days (accounting for more and more viewers giving up on network tv) so I have no hesitation in recommending the set to others.",1438992000,,531,4.698924731182796

Let's talk about the pluses. What a great concept for a show. Casting - especially Close and Dennis Haysbert - wonderful. And several episodes were a cross between the X-files and the Twilight Zone.
Negatives were few, but there were some. Heather the daughter was often irritating. And the scenes that focused extensively on her and Lisa drug a bit.
A shallow aside - Close was beautiful! Especially the first scenes *discovering* his new body and the longer shower scene later on. Yum!",1433289600,,596,4.579439252336448

It was something like science fiction, or coming back from the dead and dealing with grief, but humorous, and it had Dennis Haysbert and Eric Close (what could be better?).

In addition there are special features that include recent interviews with several cast members including Eric Close and series creator Glenn Gordon Caron that give a little more insight into the show's creation as well as perhaps the reasons why it was not renewed. Sadly I have to mark this release down a star for two reasons although if I could perhaps half a star would suffice. One great memory was the series' opening to the strains of AC/DC's ""Hells Bells"". Obviously due to royalty reasons this has been replaced on this release by some other generic heavy song. While I understand it was still disappointing to put in the first disc and not hear that tune. Also the show was filmed in 4:3 ratio originally and is ""stretched"" for this release. While it is a simple matter of changing the aspect ration on the TV to suit I would've preferred it shown with black bars to the sides. Just my preference perhaps. In any case much like the recent release of another great short-lived series ""Journeyman"", I am rapt to finally have this show in my collection.",1413763200,4,1341,4.662447257383966
6319417,5,B00J2T1856,"One of my all-time favorite shows is finally on DVD! If you've never seen ""Now And Again"" I highly recommend it. Well written and directed with a in all-star cast as most have gone on to big success. Sadly it did only last for one season. It was ahead of its time. Don't let that keep you from checking it out. The special features are also a treat. Not a lot but usually for a one season and done show, to have any extras on it is great and these are nice ones. I would have liked a blu-ray release but just to at least get it on DVD is fine.",1413504000,2,543,3.900900900900901

6319422,4,B00J2T1856,"C'mon!  The very first song of the very first minute of the very first episode was ""Hells Bells"" by AC/DC. The way it originally started was amazing. Now it's been replaced with junk music. I am thrilled to have this on DVD but very disappointed in the music replacements. Lots of amazing songs have been replaced, and those songs were a huge part of why I loved the show.",1411171200,6,372,4.391304347826087

6319424,5,B00J2T1856,"Loved this show when it aired for a single season (1999-2000) and still love it now. So glad it's finally on DVD! It's got great, sharp writing by Glenn Gordon Caron--not a surprise, since he also created and wrote almost all the episodes for ""Moonlighting"" in the '80s. Here, in telling us about an ordinary man whose brain gets secretly transplanted into a man-body following an unfortunate meeting with a subway car, he mixes together sci-fi, comedy, drama and action-adventure in perfect, entertaining measures. (The DVD picture quality is fine, the packaging ensures the discs will arrive unscratched, and the inside of the case insert contains a listing and description of every episode.)

And what a cast! Eric Close (""Dark Skies,"" ""The Magnificent Seven"" series, ""Without a Trace"") perfectly, uh, embodies said everyday guy, Michael Wiseman, who marvels at his new abilities but misses his family, which he's forbidden to contact. Margaret Colin is sexy and smart as Wiseman's wife, doing her best in the wake of her husband's ""death."" Gerrit Graham is wonderful as Wiseman's best friend, confused as heck as to why Close starts hanging around.  And last, but most certainly not least, the incomparable Dennis Haysbert, playing with both a light touch and steel menace the scientist who created Close's super-body, a man whimsical one minute, deadly serious the next. It's a role completely unlike the POTUS he later played on ""24"" and his military man on ""The Unit.""

The theme song is also a plus. So, all in all, a terrific show. Too bad it only lasted the one season. It cost too much per episode to make, apparently, and just didn't pull in the ratings. That, unfortunately, is life in the big broadcast-network game.",1411084800,7,1730,4.97923875432526
6319425,5,B00J2T1856,"this was one great show - just saw the announcement in paper, 8/26/14, that it is released - so where is it?  Amazon didn't have it available.  I really hope the complete sound track is intact and not edited out or abbreviated.  The music adds a lot of comedy to the episodes.  Oh, I am so happy this show is finally available.  They should have never cancelled it.

Now, if only they would release Tarzan with Travis Fimmel and Johnny Zero - I could die a happy woman.",1409011200,2,469,4.2727272727272725
6319426,5,B00J2T1856,"Loved this show & was really upset when they wouldn't renew for a second season. Loved the interaction between the cast & the excellent writing from Glen Gordon Caron. Counting down the days here in the UK until I get my DVD's of this brilliant series, not being released here so God bless Amazon.com & my multi-region player LOL

Just finished my first run through of many of this excellent series on DVD & thought i'd do a mini review (no spoilers)

The pros are....
1. What a brilliant job CBS have done of the transfers
2. Two and a half hours of extras & a hell of a lot of points covered. Well done again.
3. The series is still as charming & unexpected as ever. You guys will love it

The cons are... 1. As good as this set is I would have loved one or two commentaries. you really fell down on this guys. It would have made a perfect set.

I come away from this first viewing feeling great that we've got some decent transfers & I really enjoyed this excellent series again, but i still feel robbed of 5 series of this & that it was cut off before its time.

Thank you for this",1407369600,3,1085,4.147619047619048
6319427,5,B00J2T1856,"Loved this show!  Was so disgusted with CBS when it was cancelled!  Blame it on costs, changing of the guard at the network, whatever.  Now & Again was before its time and if it were to premiere now, would be a bonified hit.  Great casting, well-acted, awesomely produced.  Been waiting for years to own it, can't wait for it's release!!!",1405555200,2,338,4.566666666666666

6319429,5,B00J2T1856,"Really, I think CBS should have given us a movie special by now.  I remember when I first saw the promo, I thought it looked pretty lame.  I watched the first episode anyway, with AC/DC's ""Hell's Bells"" as the intro music, and I was hooked for the entire (far too short) 22 episode run.  I had planned to never watch ""CSI"", since that show initially had the ""Now and Again"" time slot. That didn't go as planned though.  Seems like now all we have are the same shows over and over, Now and Again was in a class all its own. Even the shows I enjoy now pale in comparison to this show.  Also, to the reviewer who was missing an episode, unfortunately the powers that be at good ole CBS decided that when Dennis Haysbert uttered the words ""Find them... Hunt them down, find them...""  one of the greatest shows of all time had run its course. I think its time they are found, in some form or other.  Its far to late for an SOS campaign, but how bout a ""Revive Our Shows"" campaign? More Now and Again, more Now and Again, more Now and Again!!! And FINALLY, before this month is out I will own the DVD collection. I lost my original over-the-air VHS copies years ago. Someone is going to have a marathon viewing over Labor Day Weekend! I still want a Movie special though. Revive Our Show, Revive Our Show, Revive Our Show!",1399939200,8,1316,4.282258064516129

And what was it replaced by...THE original CSI...Boooooooo...thats why I cant watch CSI's cause it took my show away...just get the doctor back (He's on the alstate commercials..""are you in good hands) and the Subject is now on Nashville Playing the mayor..(sorry Names escape me...)

6319441,5,B00J2T1856,It is not unusual to read that another brilliant excellent Sci-Fi Drama had been cancelled based on poor viewer's ratings in the USA. But what the programme's producers/executive or decision-makers do not ever comprehend nor understand that American Television shows are not just released in the US but the entire global universe! I am from Europe (UK/GB) and this show was critically acclaimed and good viewing figures (considering it shown at 11.30pm at night). The very funny humorous relationship between Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert) and Michael Wiseman (cheekily played by Eric Close) is terrific fun! A classic Sci-fi drama.,1395446400,13,639,5.4

At this late time, I doubt CBS will ever tie up the loose ends, and I see with the recent posts that there is still interest in this too-short series.  About a year ago I found and purchased a copy which was put on four discs by another fan and can still be found on line if you look around. It's well worth the purchase price.",1354579200,3,439,4.0344827586206895
6319448,5,B00J2T1856,"CBS has all of these redundant crime dramas and reality shows, but they couldn't give this show a chance. What killed this show, besides being on Fridays, is that it wasn't instant gratification. It wasn't nonstop explosions like 24. Instead, the show was plot-based. Some episodes had less action than others. A true sci-fi fan would appreciate this series, but a superficial fan may get bored. Some of my favorite episodes were the one when they staged Dr. Morris' kidnapping to test Michael's loyalty. He needed money quickly so he lifted a park bench full of people who were sitting down. I also liked the episode with that mentally ill kid who inadvertently witnessed Michael flip over a car. Of course, I liked the episode with that Asian terrorist (this was before 9/11). In the last episode, Mick Foley (WWE wrestler Mankind) was supposed to help him escape from prison, but they never showed that.",1350950400,2,906,4.851612903225806

This show was only one season but the producer thought it would get renewed and I thing it would have if it wasn't ahead of its time. This is a sci-fi/spy/romance show that is rather common now. If there had been more than four networks the show most likely been renewed.
Do not despair over the cliff-hanger ending, if you watch the writers round-table discussion in the extras you will find our the most likely conclusion of the plot thread.",1509321600,3,529,4.578947368421052

The first scenes of the first show were very promising. I had hoped that this would be like a hybrid of The Pretender which had lots of plot twists and a modified Six Million Dollar Man. However this show failed to hit the mark in a big way. There was too much of his interaction with his former family. And way too quickly (first/second episodes). He was also supposed to keep his secret a secret or his family would be killed and his memory erased, but those were idle threats by Dennis Haysbert's character. I would have enjoyed more plots where Eric Close's character was trying to solve more government problems. Really good plot concept that missed it's potential. I can see why it only lasted one season.",1500940800,,875,4.475
