8109205,3,B000EGDBNS,"I just bought this DVD. Only the 2 Neapolitan songs are ""real"". The 2 opera excerpts are play back. To see him ""live"" in concert, get the Tokyo recital and also get the ""Great stars of opera"", in which he sings the love duet from Un Ballo In Maschera with R&eacute;gine Crespin and E Lucevan Le Stelle from Tosca. His 2 Toscas and I Pagliacci are also play back. So is his Andrea Ch&eacute;nier. As far as I know only the La Forza Del Destino from Naples (with Renata Tebaldi and Ettore Bastianini) is live, however, the picture is rather blurry.",1281830400,2,546,4.415841584158416
8109206,4,B000EGDBNS,"This is in response to A. Boss's comments on this DVD.  On the contrary, I found the sound quality more than acceptable for a recording of this age.  What makes this DVD so compelling is the majesty of Franco Corelli.  The viewer will experience the range of Corelli's magic, in a variety of operatic scenes and special arrangements.  For those who want to experience an opera legend at the top of his form, I highly recommend this DVD.  A. Boss should stick to recent recordings, running the risk of listening to lesser singers with dubious talent often found today.",1206316800,11,567,4.686868686868687
8109207,2,B000EGDBNS,"This is an old recording from the Voice of Firestone TV program of the late 1950s and early 1960s. TV audio of that period was poor by today's standards and, although the singers (especially Corelli) sing well, the poor recording quality of that period is shown in this DVD, which is in mono even though the DVD says it is in Dolby 2.0.

It is interesting to see the much greater variety of commercial TV programing we had back then. The Voice of Firestone was one of a number of weekly classical music featured on comercial TV.",1151366400,6,528,4.443298969072165
