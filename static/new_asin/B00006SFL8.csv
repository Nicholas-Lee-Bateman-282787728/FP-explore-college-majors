7973047,3,B00006SFL8,"You don't ever know where these ""Spring Break"" DVDs are going to be set, but this one is entirely a wet t-shirt contest. There's something like a couple of dozen girls dancing on stage, probably all in their late teens and usually 1 or 2 at a time on stage. The planners needed to give the girls more instructions, though, since some of them get topless as you would expect, but several of them don't take off anything, and with their oversized t-shirts they might as well be wearing potato sacks! Maybe 3 or 4 get completely naked, with one nice-looking girl relishing her freedom of expression since once she gets naked she dances around that way on and off for the rest of the show. Overall the girls are very cute, with several standouts. I especially enjoy 2 very big-breasted girls who dance together and strip down to thongs, then caress and climb on top of each other. Too bad they weren't given half the show!

Picture quality is decent at full screen 1.33:1, but this needs better editing since many segments are fragmentary and some should have been edited out completely. Like, one girl complains to the guy assistants about something we can't hear and this goes on for a couple of minutes! Why wasn't that edited out? In another instance of poor editing, a good-looking dancer takes her shirt off, but within a couple of seconds it switches to another scene! I'm glad that the sound is live, although it's usually impossible to hear what the announcers are saying. Run time is pretty stingy at 47 minutes.

I don't know how this DVD compares to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Girls-Uncovered-Girls-of-Spring-Break-Vol-1/dp/B00005YUPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Girls Uncovered: Girls of Spring Break, Vol. 1</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Real-Girls-Uncovered-GIRLS-OF-SPRING-BREAK-3/dp/B000BF2KC0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Real Girls Uncovered GIRLS OF SPRING BREAK 3</a>. Are they all wet t-shirt contests, or are they various settings at some Spring Break festival? This Volume 2 is OK, but would have been much improved with better editing. Several really cute girls here almost save the day, and make this moderately worth seeing if you can get it cheap.",1381708800,3,2283,5.52
