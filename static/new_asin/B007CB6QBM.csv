5077115,5,B007CB6QBM,"I watched this on Netflix and found the characters and story to be refreshing, funny, and heartwarming. The interaction between families connected by business, competition, and romance was thoroughly enjoyable and and the story was redemptive, in that the children aspired to be honest and not participate is the underhanded dealings that were generally accepted and practiced in their parents generation.",1332028800,,405,5.655737704918033
5077116,5,B007CB6QBM,"And if you don't know what that means, it is Korean romantic comedy and that says everything about this cute drama. It is a bit out there with believable story but it is great for some good romance and comedy. She is tough ""player"" from high school and he is ""the nation's papa boy"" son to the ""the nation's gangster"" business man. He is suffering from fear of speaking in public and crowds and she of course cures him but many things happen, then the required third in a triangle hilariously turns into a four square. Subtitles are excellent.",1380844800,,543,4.494949494949495
5077117,5,B007CB6QBM,I was very weary of buying this and getting crappy subtitles but this boxset surpassed all my expectations. Excellent subtitles and even the extras are subtitled. Worth every cent. I wish YA Entertainment would've released more titles but now that they are no longer in business I wish them all the best to their new ventures,1380067200,2,325,4.821428571428571
5077118,5,B007CB6QBM,"I absolutely love this series.  I've watched it several times already.  The dysfunctional boos is hilarious.  The lead female does an excellent job at being tough and vulnerable while trying to be the honest person that she is.  I love it that she tells people just like it is.

Kim Jae Joong who plays the other lead male Mu-Won, is a former member of TVXQ, SBSK and is now a member of JYJ (t""he world's most popular, but unknown boyband""). I was surprised, he has some very good acting abilities.  I'm serching out more of his work now.

I absolutely adore the character of the female wrestler and BFF. She cracks me up.  She's an excellent character actor and her part helped to complete the petrsonality of Noh Eun Sol.  Down to earth and openly honest, with a bit of a violent streak.  I also liked her strange friendship with the other female lead.  Talk about opposites!

Overall I give the series a 5 out of 5 for everything.",1379289600,2,933,4.455621301775148
5077119,5,B007CB6QBM,"I always enjoy Kdramas with Ji Sung where he takes on a more serious role.  But in Protect the Boss, he was so hilarious that I was laughing out loud so many times.....There was comedy, romance and drama.  The entire cast was amazing.",1377907200,,234,4.4186046511627906
5077120,5,B007CB6QBM,This is a goofy show to watch. I'm glad I finally found it online. I was searching for a copy for months. This show has jus t the right amount of comedy & drama to make you smile.,1375574400,,179,3.736842105263158
5077121,5,B007CB6QBM,"This romantic comedy is filled with funny incidents, some sad moments, and you wanting the girl and guy to end up together at the end.",1372636800,,134,4.4
5077122,1,B007CB6QBM,"Protect the Boss (aka Mat Vu Cong So)

I already seen it on Netflix which is why I ordered it.. just a lot of reading.. I haven't watch this DVD set yet. so the condition of the DVDs are not known yet.

2/11/14, I had just attempted to watch the TV series and I can't watch it since there is no Subtitles in English for the DVD set. And since it has been so long.. I can't even return it to get replacements.. I even can't return it because I thought it had subtitles where I can watch it and know what is being said. So much for that.. No More Foreign films without checking to see if subtitles work.

I rated this down from liking it to I hate it because I can't enjoy it as I had from Netflix.",1370563200,,696,3.921985815602837
5077123,5,B007CB6QBM,"This drama is so funny and it is highly recommended! The package came fast, good quality, and the price was great!",1368489600,,114,4.476190476190476
5077124,5,B007CB6QBM,"This is a very funny romantic comedy with lots of stuff going on between the the two big-wig cousins and a very feisty lady, and all the other characters (gotta love grandma) that help in bringing in the laughts.  I really enjoyed it.  Starring (Hero) Kim Jaejoong of the Kpop boy band JYJ, actor Ji-seong, and actress Choi Kang-hee.",1365552000,,333,4.627118644067797

5077126,4,B007CB6QBM,"Had no problems with it, it was a really nice drama - it came on time and it's pretty good.",1361491200,,91,3.6
5077127,4,B007CB6QBM,This drama's funny with great chemistry between both of the lead couples. The infighting between the family is so fun. Great laughs this one.,1358121600,,141,4.916666666666667
5077128,5,B007CB6QBM,"This is one Kdrama that kept me in stitches, it was sooo fuuny, and so good to watch . It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. I initially began watching it because of Kim Jae Joong (Cha Moo Won) of the Super K-PoP group TVXQ/JYJ. (Ladies he sings as good as he looks.) But I found myself getting into the rest of the cast, caring for them as well, especially the male lead, played by Ji Song. Don't miss this one, it's a good one.",1357776000,,449,4.0
5077129,5,B007CB6QBM,"I became a big fan of ""Protect the Boss"" recently and had to check to see if a DVD set was available. Found this set and everything looked good, so I ordered. It will play on DVD players here in the States so no worries there. All the episodes are accounted for, great picture quality, and English subtitles. I was also surprised to see that this box set has special features. It has a gag reel from the show which also includes English subtitles, and a talk show featuring a really long interview with Ji Sung who plays Ji Heon on the show. I was really impressed and would recommend this set to anyone who loves the show and wants to own it.",1357344000,5,643,4.235772357723577
5077130,4,B007CB6QBM,"There is nothing too out of the box in this kdrama, but it is really enjoyable.

No Eun Seol (Choi Kang Hee)  has finally managed to land a job as an office assistant, after years of training and trying to out grow her street thug past. She's out celebrating one night and hits a guy with her shoe, all he can remember of her is that she had her hair done up in a bun like a ""poop.""

Come to find out her new boss, Cha Ji Heon (Ji Sung), is this guy, who wants her to try and find the ""poop head."" He also doesn't actually want to do work.  He is much happier just being a big kid.

As the story moves along his ambitious cousin, Cha Moo Won (Kim Jae Joong),is intrigued by Eun Seol and makes his moves both on her and towards taking Ji Heon's position.

What really makes this drama fun are the characters.  Eun Seol is still that tough street thug. She lives with her best friend, who idolizes wrestling (who is hilarious).  Ji Heon's dad loves his son but has been unable to make him do anything-- he is a bit of a mobster though, and does whatever he can to get out of sticky situations--like pretending to be in a wheel chair.

The one character who absolutely stole the screen was the second female lead, Seo Na Yoon (Wang Ji Hye). She starts off as the typical snotty princess, much like she played in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Personal-Taste/dp/B004LC2ZUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Personal Taste</a>. Na Yoon, it turns out, really was just in need of some girl friends. She ends up foisting herself on Eun Seol and her roommate--all the time. She's pretty hilarious.

Eun Seol and Ji Heon are able to learn from one another--what's great is that the character growth is not just limited to them, so the whole drama leads its viewer to feeling very good in the end.",1357344000,,1823,4.581538461538462
5077131,5,B007CB6QBM,It was such a refreshing to watch this drama. It had a different concept then the usual dramas. I loved every episode from the beginning through the end.,1352160000,4,153,4.5
5077132,4,B007CB6QBM,"This was truly a woman's movie.  Funny and engaging!  It was refreshing to see an Asian woman without any of the cultural inhibitions and a ""I will survive"" attitude.  The issue of Asian women in the workplace and the chauvanistic male attitude was
 realistically applied thoughout this movie.  The heroine is a strong and optimistic character, full of life and with lots of  spunk.",1349913600,,382,4.890625
5077133,5,B007CB6QBM,"Excellent K-drama. The storyline was great, about a young lady from the rough side of town who just wants to make a decent living. I loved the idea of having a ""wrestler"" (a female) as her best friend and the both of them being tough-as-nails. The immature, eccentric rich man with a phobia (anxiety attacks) was hilarious. All-in-all, the drama kept me in front of the television screen. The entire cast was great, the two leads - Choi Gang-Hee and Ji Sung - were unknown actors to me. I now look for their names. Protect the Boss is so worth its cost. It is a great comedy-love story.",1346889600,8,586,4.435185185185185
5077134,5,B007CB6QBM,"This is an excellent romantic comedy! I laughed every episode. There are so many funny parts and awkward, juicy moments.

The characters are all so likeable--even the ones you detest in the beginning. You wind up liking everybody in the series by the time you get to the end, and you're kind of rooting for them all. The relationships between the characters are really deep and realistic too.

My only complaint is that it drags out a little toward the end and gets a bit serious for an episode or two. But then it gets its light-hearted air back and has a really nice ending that ties up all the loose ends.

I highly recommend Protect the Boss to anyone who's looking for an all-ages, light-hearted, fun, romantic series. You'll really like it!",1340150400,14,746,4.593984962406015
5077135,4,B007CB6QBM,"Not the best K Drama but it was very enjoyable.  I enjoyed watching the boss's childish outbreaks.  He was very cute!  I really liked how the friendship developes between the girls in the show.  I'm not sure when this was made but it seems to have been made several years ago.  My favorite romantic comedies are ""The Greatest Love"", ""Lie to Me"" and ""Prosecutor Princess"".  Check them out!!!!",1339113600,,391,4.676470588235294
8514410,5,B007CB6QBM,Made me Laugh! I would see it several times and still love it!,1430265600,,62,3.8461538461538463
8514411,4,B007CB6QBM,I recommend and bought this movie. I like the story about two grandsons likely the same girl. And how knowing her changed so many lives. For  a story on conditioning love of friends and family.,1429142400,,193,4.514285714285714
8514412,5,B007CB6QBM,This was a pleasure to watch. The kind of drama where you can watch the same scenes over and over again and still find it amusing. Good cast. The DVD is a good Investment if you like K-dramas.,1417132800,,192,4.078947368421052
8514413,5,B007CB6QBM,"Completly worth the money! It came on time, plus the box/holders is awesome!  ^^ I'm so happy to have it in my collection.",1410480000,,122,4.304347826086956
8514414,5,B007CB6QBM,"Just rewatched this and understand why I decided I wanted to own it after having originally watched it on DramaFever.com.  Yes, it's ditzy, but the acting is wonderful, the characters are for the most part ultimately lovable, and if you're a fan of '40s movies like ""Bringing Up Baby"" or Tracy/Hepburn films, this might be for you.  One bonus of owning this is the Special Features at the end, which, aside from including bloopers (nothing great), includes a segment of a show with a lot about Ji Sung's family, start in acting, and more.  Watching it made me like him all the more, and I will definitely keep an eye out for more of his future work.",1406592000,,649,4.52991452991453
8514415,5,B007CB6QBM,"Even though I don't speak the language, the show wasn't difficult to follow. I understand that some words/phrases are difficult to translate, but I never felt that I was missing something. There are subtitles (hooray!). This is the very first KDrama that I have watched that has made me want to watch more. I definitely recommend it to anyone of any age. The story line doesn't drag. It also isn't filled with fillers, overly sexual and violent themes to catch your attention. The characters are all lovable. However there was one I didn't like so much, but she wasn't a ""main"" player. This show has made me laugh out loud and even tear up a little.
With that being said, give this show a go. Watch at least two episodes and I am sure you'll be hooked! :) I was hooked from the first 20 minutes! Haha!",1387929600,,801,4.45578231292517
8514416,5,B007CB6QBM,"If you love immature and crazy family situations, then you'll love this drama. I bought this because the member from one of my favorite Kpop groups, JYJ, has a lead role. This drama is exciting and the product came on time. The case is sturdy and will last long. I definitely recommend this because it's worth the low price!",1386374400,,324,4.508474576271187
8514417,5,B007CB6QBM,"This was the first korean drama I watched, and it was absolutely hilarious. It's easy to get attached to all the characters, and so hard to stop watching! I bought it on dvd after seeing it on instant watch because I liked it so much. Great TV for everyone!",1386115200,,257,4.26530612244898
8514418,5,B007CB6QBM,"Ji Sung is the reason I watched on the net but having seen it I had to own it.  If you need something you can count on to make your day brighter, this is it.  I love Korean dramas.  The casting for each character is usually spot on and this series is no exception.  All of the actors did a great job, including Kim Jaejong from JYJ.  Each character is well developed as is the relationships between them.",1383436800,,404,4.128205128205129
