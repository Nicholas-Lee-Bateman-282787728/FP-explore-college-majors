7980629,5,B00008976Q,"this was the first 3-part duel in yugioh and it really needed to be. the Para-Dox brothers aren't really clever enemies, but the way this duel works is pretty interesting, it basicly turn yugioh into a combo with D&D. this is one of the best duels in the duelest kingdom arc, the only one that are turely better is face off(yugi v. kaiba) and Best of friends, best of duelists( yugi v. joey). Overall i wish there could have been more of this style of dueling in yugioh but this is good enough.",1308009600,,494,4.32258064516129
