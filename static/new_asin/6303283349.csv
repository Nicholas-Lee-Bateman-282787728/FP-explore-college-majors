Gay Gasper leads a hi-lo (or mixed impact as she calls it) aerobics routine.  The entire workout including warmup and cooldown is not much longer than 20 minutes.

The setting is bright and colorful, same as Sensational Step and Fat Burner, Yesh and Lisa are again the aerobic participants.  The music is high energy which fits the workout well.

The workout itself starts out as low impact, then after a bit higher impact, then combining the two.  The choreography is simple to pick up.  Nothing much more complicated than jumping jacks, grapevine, step touches, kicks, knee lifts, etc.

I personally haven't been much of a high impact aerobics fan, I found that I was able to modify the high impact moves to low impact pretty easily, for example instead of jumping jacks, I subbed low jacks.  While the routine is short, it's very bouncy and bound to get your heartrate up.  Keeping it low, I don't get as much out of it, but it was enjoyable nonetheless.

The biggest drawback is that it's so short, but the time you get your heartrate into the steady fat burning states this program advertises, the workout is over.  I would suspect the short length of these workouts are the reason these tape sets didn't take off.  As the years go on, they are becoming harder to find.  Too bad, because the entire series covers most everything, total body, upper body, lower body, step aerobics, low impact aerobics, hi-lo aerobics, even yoga and stretching.

I am glad that I tried this though, much of my workout video collection consists of videos like this, I enjoy vintage videos and get a kick out of trying them out, even if they don't entirely work for me.

I can't comment on Upper Body as I haven't done it.  I pretty much purchased these 2 tape sets for the aerobic workouts and didn't give the strength videos a try.

Overall, for those who like hi-lo aerobics, this is fun routine, too short though.",1259280000,,1956,4.620289855072464
