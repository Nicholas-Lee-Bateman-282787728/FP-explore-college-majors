616754,5,6303257690,"This movie took forever to be released on dvd,But it was worth it. Falk and lemmon haven't been better since the great race this movie is great at showing the saying that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.
well acted and very funny. though its a burn to order from WB the picture is just fine.",1343001600,4,308,4.237288135593221
616755,3,6303257690,"Harrison Ford is in this film for about a minute -- Jack Lemmon backs his car into Harrison Ford's vehicle, which in turn causes Ford to get out and punch Jack Lemmon squarely in the nose! Ford sports a natty hat and vest, by the way.",1283990400,2,234,4.108695652173913

616757,5,6303257690,This offbeat comedy was a wonderful play and is terrifically presented on film. Peter Falk and Jack Lemmon show great timing and characterization is a film version of a play that could have been written specifically for them. I've viewed it over and over and still breakup every time I see it. TV versions make inappropriate cuts to the movie which must be seen in video to be truly appreciated.,1010793600,12,395,4.6571428571428575
7842606,3,6303257690,This offbeat comedy has some good parts but doesn't hold together well as a movie.  For me it's three stars.  But  others may like it more.,1521849600,,139,4.269230769230769
7842607,5,6303257690,"It took me years to find this movie. I kept telling my friends about it, expecially the scene where Peter Falk sells his chair, then has a meeting with his boss and pretends to be siting in it and ends with him walking in a sitting/leaning position. Funny movie. So far I have bought 2 more for one of my nieces and one of my son-in-laws.  Strongly recommend it to anyone.",1453507200,,372,4.23943661971831

7842609,5,6303257690,A wonderful film for fans of Elaine May!,1435363200,,40,4.125

7842611,5,6303257690,"This item was purchased many years ago and want off my screen. Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star. Great product, I think??",1386028800,,154,4.344827586206897
7842612,1,6303257690,This is very dated and plays like a bad version of a Love American Style rerun. Stars of this caliber should have had better material to work with but it was probably a sign of the times when prevalent recreational drug use made everything seem funnier than it really was.,1377129600,2,272,4.46
7842613,3,6303257690,This movie okay. Nothing to get too excited about. May suit anyone looking for movies from this era. I purchased dvd because I like Elaine May. But this was not as funny as I had hoped.,1370995200,3,185,4.166666666666667
7842614,5,6303257690,"I could not believe that i was able to find this film. simpley love this movie. I believe if alot of todays couples whether married or not would sit down and check this movie out, there would be a whole lot of problems resolved because they would see them selves and wonder why they acted the way they did.and get some issues worked out!",1369785600,2,337,4.28125
7842615,2,6303257690,"Why, its harrison ford's first bit part for 1967. This movie reminds me of the quirkiness of Green Acres. I think most movies from 62 to 68 needed a keen patience to watch. This is one of them.",1350518400,3,193,4.105263157894737
