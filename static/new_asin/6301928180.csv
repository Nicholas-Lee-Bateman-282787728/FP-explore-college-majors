382271,4,6301928180,"Reilly wasn't quite Neil's international debut: ""My Brilliant Career"" was half a decade earlier.  But this was the young Sam Neil's star turn, playing the first ""professional"" English spy.  His methods were so ruthless, and sexual conquests so frequent (and a matter of indifference or a plot device) that Reilly was said to be Ian Flemming's model for 007.  Neil plays it brilliantly, and were it not for the incomparable Leo McKern as a sometimes ally, sometimes foe, Neil's would be one of the few true actors.

The first six episodes are some of the finest espionage ever brought to the small screen--particularly the linked episodes five and six, with their punning titles.  After that, however -- faithful to history -- the show turns dramatically, as Reilly makes a play to lead the White Russians against the Bolsheviks. One knows nothing good can come of it, and the easy humor and cynicism of the first six episodes disappears.

Four stars for episodes one through six.  Don't bother watching the rest.",1451347200,3,1012,4.91764705882353

382301,5,6301928180,"Sam Neill at his best.

This is about the first really starring role Sam Neill had which was widely seen in America.  The series was filmed in Great Britain and first shown in America on PBS.  If is a long series, and as is typical of British dramas, one must pay attention to the characters and the details to keep up with the story as it moves along.  I liked it so much I first purchased it on VHS before DVDs existed.

I confess, although I have watched it all the way through at least 3 times, I find the ending somewhat confusing.  Other than the end couple of episodes, it follows the book pretty closely.  It helps to have read the book first, but it is not absolutely necessary.  The story moves along well, and Neill plays a most ruthless but charming spy. The other actors are very accomplished throughout.  Leo McKern is memorable, even though he only appears in 4 episodes.  Good thing, because his role is pivotal to the story.

Ian Fleming has been quoted as saying that he based James Bond on Sidney Reilly -- and that Bond ""is no Reilly.""

Don't binge watch this series.  Watch one or two episodes a week and really savor the story and the production.",1417219200,2,1168,4.376744186046512

Before viewing, it would be helpful to refresh one's history in the events leading up to the 1905 Russo-Japanese War and the sinking of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur.  In the ""Trust"" episode, there was a shot my family waited to see of a C.F. Voysey-designed house southwest of London and we compliment the treatment the director gave this graceful filming site.",1415836800,,556,4.78125

I would recommend watching the little bio bit at the end before you start, as it gives a historical context for the episodes, which I think would make them more interesting to view (as it is rather slow-moving; a bit like the original Upstairs downstairs, ie. 'you kind of have to get into it'). Sam Neill is great.
Prefer Le Carre, although I know many say it is slow-moving also, but Le Carre's action is in the mind; I did not get a sense of that here. Sidney seemed a bit of a black box to me.",1391212800,,674,4.232558139534884

The writing, casting and period sets are all, of course, top notch and up to the usual British standards for this type of show. Sam Neill owns the part of Reilly and I can't see anyone else playing it now.  The actual filming is looking a bit dated due to the advances in technology, but don't let that throw you off.  This is a great series. These are based (loosely) on the real exploits of one of the first ""super"" spies.  Sidney ""Reilly"", is a master manipulator, a man of flexible morals, probably a sociopath, and not above toppling a government to further his self interests.  Great stuff for spy and history buffs as it pulls in much of the chaos and plots of the early 20th century in Europe and Asia.",1387843200,2,790,4.3108108108108105

He displays the extraordinary demeanor and composure of Reilly as well as Reilly's seductive, persuasive, and charismatic character. I watched it mezmorized to the end. I learned a great deal of the history of the time and how the course of history might have been altered if in fact Lenin had met with an untimely death.

Sidney Riley was sent there to steal documents important to the British Government. We are then taken to Port Arthur, Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. Then we head back to Germany where Riley spies in the Naval Facilities of the Kaiser's Germany. We also go to France where Riley helps to get hold of a drilling baron with Wells in Mesopotamia (IRAQ). The story then shifts to the Russian Theatre where Riley starts down the road which would see him mix in High Society, Sabotage Naval Acquisitions before the war, try to overthrow the Bolshevik Government after the War, then continue to meddle in Soviet Politics which eventually leads to his capture and execution.

The 1983 TV series speculated on his torture and death at the hands of Felix Dzerzhinsky and Stalin. When I was in Moscow in 1984 I asked someone with KGB connections if they could tell me what happened. The answer was that they were very familiar with Reilly, considered him one of the greatest threats to the government, but would not discuss his fate.

When the Soviet Union was falling, a CNN reporter stood near a crowd pulling down a statue.  The reporter said it was of the founder of the KGB and the building was it's HQ...but he didn't know the name of the man.  ""Felix Dzerzhinsky and the Lubianka Prison"" I called out.

It's interesting to see many actors from Brit TV (e.g. David Suchet, Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy) then on the cusp of recognition. Tom Bell, a veteran actor even then, has never been so effective as Dzerzhinsky; Leo McKern is a believable rogue as Zaharoff. Reilly is an anti-hero at best, yet we find ourselves fascinated by and perhaps rooting for him (sometimes, anyway)in his daring, difficult intrigues and adventures. All told, an always enjoyable experience.

382353,5,6301928180,"I watched this series on PBS in 1983, making a poor quality VHS copy for future viewing.  I was delighted to find this set and purchase it before it sold out.  Sidney Reilly was a legendary spy in His Majesty's Secret Service.  He was considered a loose cannon because he despised his handlers and planned his own missions on the fly.  An opportunist, he pulled off some of the greatest coups in British Intelligence in the early 20th century, and he did them using his own initiative and cool daring.

Sam Neill stars as Sidney Reilly in what I feel is his most compelling role.  Great performances by Norman Rodway and Tom Bell are just two that come to mind without digging.  The entire production is first rate, but it is Neill performing as Reilly who makes this the very best spy series ever filmed.

Sidney Reilly was the model for Ian Fleming's James Bond.  Sending a copy of his first Bond novel to a friend in British Intelligence to review, he included a note saying, ""Of course, Bond is no Sidney Reilly.""

If you cannot obtain this particular set, other products are available.  Just be aware that the opening episodes were edited into a movie that comes nowhere near telling the whole story or even hinting at what great coups Reilly would pull off later.  Steer clear of it.  For the connoisseur of the spy genre, this is a must have set, all the more so because it is based on facts as best they can be gleaned from the ever elusive Reilly.",1337558400,,1456,4.46969696969697
382356,5,6301928180,"This is a very fun, if largely apocryphal, version of many of the key events that shaped the 20C. You have a mysterious man, Reilly, who pops up where something absolutely decisive is happening. Ostensively a British agent, he mixes self-enrichment, his personal life, and politics in machinations that can only be called guileful, ruthless, and for the most part effective. He is one of those ambiguous figures that appear at historical turning points, sparking endless debates about whether they are blatant opportunists or the simplest of idealists. You could compare him to Alcibiades, Wallenstein, or perhaps Richard Clarke. The man is a walking paradox - brilliant and passionate, yet perhaps also a greedy sociopathic visionary - and the best part of it is, Sam Neill pulls it off with complete believability, with a stellar group of lesser-known character actors.

In terms of plot, Reilly is present for the early maneuvering to gain access to oil - the key to industrialization and mechanized warfare, the bases for 20C power - and then is a player in the Russo-Japanese war, a maintenance worker who steals German shipping blueprints (and an industrialist who does the same thing), and finally a (counter?) revolutionary in the transition of Russia into the Soviet Union. This is a fun and fascinating view into these events, a re-rendering that reminds the viewer that none of these things was set in stone for the history books but could have turned out very differently. To me as a history buff, it makes it come alive in the most wonderful way. Of course, no one knows if Reilly did all these things, so this can only be taken as fiction, but you witness Lenin, Stalin, and a parade of British politicians and bureaucrats and many others.

Along the way, Reilly introduces new methods into the British secret service, legitimizing the most ruthless manipulation of people in the cause that he is currently championing. For example in one episode (***spoiler alert***), while apparently out of the spy business and a financier in Russia, he seduces a married aristocrat, who wants to divorce in order to marry him; Reilly then pays off her husband with a settlement, who happens to be Defense Minister in the Tzar's government, legitimizing a commercial agent Reilly needs, and pulls off the ""arms deal of the century"", gaining intelligence for the British, beating an old rival, and hugely enriching himself at the same time. Some cry scandal (he is already married), others see genius.

Neill also creates a fascinating character that is revealed slowly throughout the entire series. It is a masterpiece of subtlety and moral ambiguity that is never reduced to a simple formula, but stands as an enigma. The ending is a surprise, yet so typically Reilly. That makes it excellent drama. The sets are also period perfect, evoking a vanished world.  The only problem is the graininess of the transfer, which is a minimal distraction.

Shot in glorious period detail, one heart-pulsing mission after another captures the arc of Reilly's brilliant career. From stealing top-secret Russian oil information to a near overthrow of the Bolshevik Revolution to his final capture by Stalin's forces in 1918, Reilly's exploits are at times so daring and reckless it's hard to believe it's history and not fiction.""

I cannot agree more with this tantalizing synopsis printed on the DVD back cover!

British author Robin Bruce Lockhart (born 1920), whose book this miniseries is based upon, was the son of the British diplomat and spymaster, Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart (1887-1970), a personal friend of Sidney Reilly and a participant in some of the intrigues and espionage in the Kremlin during the early days of the Russian Revolution. The British agents, Boris Savinkov, Sidney Reilly and Robert Bruce Lockhart, were trying to get Lenin and the Russian government to renounce the humiliating Russian-German peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 3, 1918) and entice the Bolsheviks to rejoin the war against Germany. When this did not happen, they were to attempt to overthrow the Bolsheviks!

Robin Bruce Lockhart's book, Ace of Spies, was published in 1967. The television miniseries ""Reilly: Ace of Spies,"" written by Troy Kennedy-Martin and starring the New Zealand superstar, Sam Neill, aired in 1983, recounting the British super-spy Sidney Reilly's saga in graphic, cinematographic detail. Lockhart's book was then republished in 1984 as Reilly: Ace of Spies.

In 2005, A&E released the miniseries' 12 original episodes in a 4-disc DVD format (approx. 10 hours, 30 minutes, plus extras). The collector's set includes a documentary, ""Life of Reilly: The Super Spy,"" that narrates the true facts of the case and fills in some biographical and historic gaps. For example, what were the real circumstances surrounding Sidney Reilly's disappearance in Russia in the autumn of 1925, and the extent of his knowledge regarding the Trust organization?

Had Reilly gone to Russia to expose the Trust organization as a ""false flag"" operation and to avenge his friend Boris Savinkov? Or like Savinkov, had Reilly fallen into an incredibly unsuspecting trap, under the spell and deception of the infamous false ""monarchist"" Trust operation, which was, in fact, a counter-intelligence organization created by Feliks Dzerzhinsky and the Bolshevik secret police, the Cheka, precisely to lure White Russians and other ""enemies of the revolution"" back to Russia for their arrest and extermination?

The informative documentary clarifies any discrepancies in the necessarily dramatized and romanticized miniseries, viz-a-viz the harsh realities of what transpired.

The miniseries, ""Reilly: Ace of Spies"" is a superb historic epic to which I ascribe a 5-star rating for its excellent cinematographic adaptation and dramatization of history, so conveniently accompanied by its concluding documentary, as described. I wholeheartedly recommend this collector miniseries for your DVD library!

382363,3,6301928180,"This review concerns itself with the four DVD set by Thames.

The tonal qualities of the images throughout the entire series is very poor.
To be more precise:

1. In dark scenes, there is no detail in the shadows.
2. In normal bright scenes, there is excessive flare, thus reducing the contrast and color saturation of the image. (Light from the bright areas impinges on the darker areas, thus reducing contrast. This is equivalent to raising the black level and reducing the contrast ratio).
3. Image resolution is below par.

This suggests that in the transfer process, gamma adjustment was wrong and, if this were an optical, rather than an electronic transfer, the optics caused the flare.

BBC / Thames should be thoroughly ashamed of the slipshod job they did on an otherwise excellent film. Let us hope they remedy this situation and do justice to this most interesting and well acted and staged series.

I was born in Russia, I speak russian and back in late 60 ties the Russian TV made 4 parts series named ""Operation Trest"". Somehow russian translators could not interpret the word Trust correctly. Of course the 4 TV black & white mini series were made from the Soviet point of view, without  Stalin, Artuzov was in charge, etc. but these mini series they were good at that time.
I could say that British made 12 part miniseries are thousand times better and more impressive. The actors are excellent, the British setting is very natural. The only negative thing is that Russian scenes  does not look very russian. There is a lack of background of the cities such as Moscow and St. Petersbourg. Of course, at that time during  film production in 1983 the filmakers could not easily access  the Soviet Union. Another thing that all officers of the soviet secret police incuding Stalin are wearing the medal of the "" Hero of the Soviet Union "". This medal had been established during World War -II and has nothing to do with the 1925 era. Also some russian military uniforms looks funny. The makers of the film should invite expatriated russian
military experts to consult during production.
To conclude my short note I like to say this is very great movie. I enjoyed the British English, dialect, accent, intonation. The quality of DVDs are OK. They were transfered from VHS to DVDs. Just remember the bygone era when we watched TVs.",1294963200,4,1520,4.618518518518519

The cast is superb. From Norman Rodway (Cummings) to Felix Dzerzhinsky (Tom Bell), these are top-shelf performers. There is even a tip of the hat to the occult.

Based on the life of Sigmund Rosenblum, the bastard son of a physician, it is set in the adventures of a man who, it is said, spied for 4 countries, Russia being his heartland. It is filled with fascinating characters and stories related (in various degrees) to true events, thus offering historical sidedishes.

All the time he is making money and we are never sure whether he is just a British spy or a double agent or just out for himself.

Each episode brings him to a different location and/or time where he shows an extraordinary understanding of the political and economic situation that he is in.

A little added plus is where a psychic vividly predicts his death.

My old videotapes from a VCR are of better quality that this DVD set.

382379,4,6301928180,"Ian Fleming readily admitted that he based the exploits of James Bond on the real-life Sidney Reilly, the Russian-born Cambridge-educated double agent who involved himself in many affairs of the crown during the reigns of Edward VII and George V. This beautifully produced miniseries details many of his exploits from roughly the beginning of Edward's reign through 1925, when Reilly was duped into traveling to Russia and captured by Stalin, who had him executed. The series is highly episodes, with minimal narration, and even if you've got a handle on the events of the Russo-Japanese War or the Great Game or the Red Terror, you might find yourself constantly checking historical sources to figure out what's what and who's who. Yet that still didn't seriously diminish from my enjoyment of this series. This miniseries was made during what might be called the Golden Age of British miniseries, in the early Eighties when television companies were awash with money and spent much more lavishly than they had even ten years prior: as a result, this series (like BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN, and THE FLAME TREES OF THIKA) is incredibly handsomely mounted, with lavish costumes, hairstyling, props and locations. It seems like a documentary of another age (before there were color movie cameras), and captures the feel of the back alleys of Paris, the tea-rooms of St. Petersburg, the offices of Whitehall, and the shipyards of Germany at the turn of the century.

The darkly handsome and almost demonic looking Sam Neill was ideally cast as the manipulative womanizing Reilly; the series pulls no punches in showing how cold-hearted he could be, even to his own wives when they interfered with his work. There are many fine actors here who would become even more famous in the worlds of British theater, television, and stage present, including Bill Nighy as another and more vulnerable British agent, Lindsay Duncan in a fine turn as an amusing demimondaine called ""The Plugger,"" and, in ridiculous makeup (perhaps the series's only production disappointment), David Suchet in a bizarre turn as a Chinese agent and Leo McKern as the munitions manufacturer and figure of intrigue Boris Zaharoff. (McKern seems to be wearing Orson Welles' awful putty nose from THE LONG HOT SUMMER--it keeps changing shape, and rarely matches his skin tones.) By far the best episodes of the series are numbers even and eight, when Reilly becomes involved in an elaborate plot in 1918 to depose the Bolsheviks and lead a new Russian government determined to re-involve the Russians in the World War; the conclusion of this two-parter, showing the final fate of several of the women who have worked with Reilly, is beautifully done and quite moving. The shows' creators mount a memorable credit sequence, involving a sad nostalgic kinestatis of images from the century's turn (a Romanov family portrait, the Manhattan skyline, Lenin speaking to the crowds) accompanied by Shostakovich's lush ""Romance"" movement of his violin suite for the film ""The Gadfly"" (based on a novel with a major character inspired by the actual Sidney Reilly).",1269475200,3,3136,5.113060428849902

382383,5,6301928180,"Based on the real-life experiences of Sidney Reilly, a spy who worked for the British Secret Service at the beginning of the 20th Century, this is a look at real espionage at its best. Reilly operated in Hamburg, Port Arthur, the Caucasus, St. Petersburg and Moscow and had many adventures in the service. Of course, his activities prior to 1918 pale when compared to his role in an attempt to overthrow the Bolshevik government. Had it been successful Reilly would have ended up as the ruler of Russia himself.

The acting is superb and the plot keeps drawing you in. A fascinating program, one I can't recommend highly enough. Just remember that while this is a great story, based on history, it is still a story and not necessarily history. It probably wouldn't be nearly as interesting had it been closer to the mark. Plus, some incidents are just speculative while others have been changed to make them more melodramatic (at one point a victim is shot by the CHEKA in some elaborate scenario, but in fact the secret police simply shot you in the head with a pistol, as is portrayed elsewhere in the series).

This is how you wish history was. For how it REALLY was, there is a short documentary on the last disc which shows that Reilly was not the dapper hero he is shown in the series.",1250812800,3,1291,4.560344827586207

When it originally broadcast 25 years ago it was met with immense critical acclaim. It made Sam Neill an overnight star. I remember watching Vincent Price do a wonderful job as narrator between episodes each week setting the stage for each successive program.
To watch Reilly start his career as a down and out novice living in a cheap flop house, to being on first name basis with the most powerful men in the world and engaged in projects that changed the course of history, is a terrific piece of film making. Everything is done with period accuracy, right down to side conversations about the merits of one kind of Austrian pistol vs another. All spot on correct. The supporting cast is super with Leo McKern doing the performance of his career as the international arms tycoon Basil Zaharoff. He even looks like Zaharoff. David Burke as the ultra sinister Stalin and a murderous Tom Bell as Cheka spy chief Felix Djerzinski are both outstanding.  THIS is what you watch television for!!

382385,3,6301928180,"Although this series in and of itself is absolutely wonderful, and fascinating, my mother and I have discovered a problem with the DVD set. This will not be an issue for many, but there are others (like my mother) that it will. Within the last 2 years my mother has lost most of her hearing. She has a VHS set of this program, and it is well worn, but it still would have been fine. There was, however, no Closed Captioning capability on the VHS tapes. Thus we ordered the relatively new DVD set. Unfortunately, without really looking for the subtitle issue. Most DVDs have them. And if they don't, they have added a Closed Captioning availability. But this DVD set has neither. For us this is a huge impediment.

I would like to make it clear that this issue is not an Amazon problem. And in all fairness, their information about the set never did say that there were subtitles or Closed Captioning. I was not looking for it, and I suspect that other people in our position would likely be in a similar situation, and just expect that A&E, who produced this set, would have taken care of this, as most DVDs have done.

On another issue, although the picture is clear, the color has not been ""remastered"". It has the same problems as the VHS tapes had. The packaging is lovely, and actually leads one to expect that more work was done on the transfer to DVD. Unfortunately it was not.

If you still have VHS tape playing capability, and the tapes, there is not much reason to get the DVD set. Especially if your picture is clear enough.

Perhaps the one episode where a British spy (not Reilly) is discovered in the German docks is a little weaker than the rest; it is also apparent from the biography that some episodes are severely artistically licensed.

Tight early 1980's made for TV budgets do show through from time to time. This story is worth making again.

In his time, Reilly brought down a British Government, helped create a dangerous war machine in Germany as Hitler was coming to power, came close to brining down the bolsheviks, single-handedly destroyed one of history's most powerful political and espionage agencies and in so doing showed Stalin to be the mad man he was.

I mean, after all the whole schtick is about secrets isn't it...so how does anyone really know what a given spy's life was like?  That said, when a friend of mine mentioned another series I thought immediately of the great A&E series featuring Reilly, Ace of Spies.  And once I'd brought that memory to mind I found I could not get the theme music out of my head.  Haunting stuff.  So I bought the set and watched all 12 episodes over the three days following its arrival.  The documentary included with the DVD set (which I'd not seen before) did a good job of convincing me (though frankly I didn't really care) the series was probably as true to Sigmund Rosenblum's life as it was possible to get within the need to create dramatic impact.  And dramatic impact is a faint phrase to use for these productions.  From Sam Neill through darn near ever player one gets top-notch performances that leave little to be desired.  I can't speak too highly of the collection.

The one ""problem"" I have with this set is that it messes with anything in the way of a schedule I might want to keep in my life.  Once I've cued up the first episode I simply have to watch them all. And I find I do that quite often.  Aces!",1202342400,3,1271,4.384615384615385

382412,4,6301928180,". . . may live to spy another day, but unlike James Bond, Sidney Reilly is (or was) a mortal spy, not a cardboard one. His enemies (and those of the West for most of the last century) actually got him in the end (1925). Knowledge of this fact, and that Reilly (aka Sigmund Rosenblum of Odessa) was actually employed by the British Secret Intelligence Service and played a significant, if covert, part in world events only enhances the suspense of this excellent British series, which one does not want to end the way it did in real life.

Part ""007 for the Educated,"" and part ""Upstairs-Downstairs"" in spirit, this series follows the adventures of the ""Ace of Spies,"" against the backdrop of history, from 1900 until 1925. The series, in fact, would make an excellent teaching tool for a high school or college World History class, when annotated by a history instructor. From the 1904 Japanese sinking of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur in Manchuria, through the Russian Revolution of 1917, until Stalin's paranoic ascendency in the 1920's, the viewer is treated to a ""rippng yarn"" in which the historic connivings of the Usual Suspects for oil, arms and power (What else?) is one of the most fascinating aspects. We even have a ""good Bolshie"" (sort of) in the persona of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka (later the KGB), and ""bad Bolshie"" in that of Joseph Stalin (You were expecting, maybe, Kim Philby?). At any rate, the series is gripping from beginning to end.

Yes, the quality of the color is rather on the sepia side, but this defect (if it is a deliberate one) contributes to the ""historical"" ambience of ""Reilly."" I also began to wonder whether the Moscow of Lenin & Co. was really as spic and span as presented (but then, I may have been influenced by the propaganda of the last century that suggests otherwise). I was, however, less than impressed by the makeup: Leo McKern's nose, in particular, kept changing shape and color, until in his last scenes, it looked just like what it was: putty. Furthermore, the maquillage on Reilly's first wife, who was supposed to be fifty, with clown white under her eyes, and black shadow on her cheeks, was simply amateurish. These flaws, however (for which I have witheld a star), are but flyspecks on the panorama of an otherwise excellent series from the BBC.",1181692800,5,2321,4.714285714285714

This really well-made series about the life of a man whose real-life exploits  beggar those of the fictional James Bond is absolutely riveting. Reilly(real name Sigmund Rosenblum, a Russian Jewish emigre from Odessa) is a fascinating character--highly intelligent; amoral yet capable of inspiring great friendships; brave yet careful; secretive yet often daring to the point of recklessness. He was involved in so many plots and was instrumental in so much that went on in espionage, and world events, in the early part of the 20th century--it is amazing, really, considering what one man could do, in those days. You can't imagine one spy making such a difference in modern times..

It's all beautifully done and acted--and the superlative Sam Neill, with his controlled elegance and deep gaze is the perfect actor to take on a demanding and complex role. Highly recommended!

382444,5,6301928180,"Sidney Reilly really was an international man of mystery and no-one really knew him including his wives and fellow spies.  Sam Neil was incredible as Reilly. He showed a man who was elegant, charming and yet so ruthless you could almost see the ice in his veins. He doesn't have a problem with killing and he doesn't have a problem with leaving an incompetent agent behind either. He was a womanizer who could be the ultimate romantic in one scene then simply walk away in the next. One of the most touching scenes in the series is when Reilly's wives and sweethearts all clamor for news of him. He's treated some of these women horribly. One he's turned into a hopeless drunk but they still can't get enough of him. In another scene, one of his conquests calmly faces death rather than betray him. After her death Reilly, the series implies, carries her earrings, the only thing he has left of her on him for the rest of his life.

Reilly has been called the grandfather of the Jame Bond character because by the time young Ian Flemming came along Reilly was a legend in the British spy world. Flemming denied this but Reilly's relationship with his spymaster is very reminiscent of Bond and M and of course there all those women.

Everything about this series is great. The acting is all top notch, the costumes are perfect, the music, especially Romance of the Gadfly, Reilly's theme is unforgettable.

382446,5,6301928180,"This mini-series is about the life and times of the master spy Sigmund Rosenbloom, alias Sidney Reilly.  While Reilly isn't very well-known, he (supposedly) was deeply involved in several extremely crucial developments of the early 20th Century.  With great skill and at great risk, he: played a complicated game against the infamous and powerful ""merchant of death"" Sir Basil Zaharoff, infiltrated the German weapons industry pre-WWI, helped secure the oil supply for the British Navy (crucial for the conversion from coal), was at the center of an (almost successful) effort to overthrow the Bolsheviks before they solidified their control of Russia, etc. etc.  And, if this re-creation is to be believed, he did it all with flair.

It should be pointed out that, unlike James Bond or George Smiley, Sidney Reilly really did exist.  He is considered by some to be the first modern secret agent.  However, I should also mention that many of the events depicted in this mini-series are of doubtful authenticity.  Actually, it's hard to believe that any one person could really have been involved with so many crucial events and done so much.  However, I've seen Ian Fleming quoted as saying that compared to Sidney Reilly, James Bond was ""nothing special.""  Perhaps he really was the most important man who almost nobody has heard of.  Of course, we will never know exactly what all the true details are, the very nature of what Reilly did was top secret...

Regardless of whether you take this show as documentary or highly-embellished history, it is a marvelous work (despite the look of being filmed on a small budget).  Without trying to rehash it, the subject matter couldn't be more interesting, the story-telling more engrossing, or the acting more believable - this is Sam Neill's finest work IMHO.  Lots of intrigue, mind games, double-crossing, action and (non-graphic) sex.

382448,5,6301928180,"Reilly - Ace of Spies is the best extended series of spy films ever made, in my opinion, for many reasons.

First, the cast of this twelve episode story is uniformly excellent beginning with Sam Neil as Sidney Reilly, a Russian born jew named Sigismund Rosenblum, who goes to work for the British Secret Service and takes the name Reilly because he thinks the Irish are well accepted all over the world.  And Reilly travels over much of the world doing the dirty work of the British government.  Neil brings complexity to his role as an agent who believes the end justifies the means.  Machiavelli would be pleased with Neil's performance.

Leo McKern as Basil Zaharov, an arms dealer with morals similar to Reilly's and ability almost the equal of Reilly, is the best of an outstanding supporting cast.  McKern is superb throughout the series.  Zaharov goes head to head with Reilly and their conflicts result in many dramatic and surprising encounters.

Next is Tom Bell as Felix Dzerzhinsky, head of the Russian secret police at the beginning of the Russian Revolution of 1917.  Bell is totally convincing as he deals first with Lenin, in a fine performance by Kenneth Cranham, and then Stalin, played by David Burke.  Dzerzhinsky loves Lenin, hates Stalin, and respects Reilly, his nemesis and more than his equal.  Reilly wants to overthrow Lenin and put himself in Lenin's place.  He almost succeeds.

Norman Rodway and Peter Egan are both convincing as Reilly's control officers in the British Secret Service.  Spying is a nasty business and we are never sure who will betray whom.

Women, particulary Reilly's wives, played by Jeananne Crowley, wife #1, Celia Gregory, #2, and Laura Davenport, #3, play a supporting role to the ace of spies, but each wife figures prominently in the ongoing story.  All give effective performances.

2. A short biography of Sidney Reilly is presented as the final presentation on Disc #4.  It is apparent that the producers have stayed fairly close to historical fact. Even without the history lesson the story stands on its own merits and is totally engrossing and genuinely entertaining.  I planned to watch two episodes at a time, but often found myself playing a third episode to find out what would happen next, and then watching the scenes from the next installment to wet my appetite for the next show.  The only films I have seen that compare favorably with The Ace of Spies are Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People.  I must admit that Alec Guiness, as George Smiley, is a better actor than Sam Neil, but I think the Ace of Spies series is at least as good as the Smiley stories, with the added benefit of much more history delivered in the Ace series.  Reilly - Ace of Spies is a great story from beginning to end.

3. The production values of this series are excellent.  It feels like we have been transported in time to the first 25 years of the 20th Century.  From the offices of the Secret Service in London, to Port Arthur on the Russian Pacific Coast, to St. Petersburg, Moscow, Paris, etc., attention has been paid to the smallest detail.  These films look and feel like a big budget production.

4. The only negative reviews of Ace of Spies on Amazon relate to the DVD transfer, which was just good enough not to spoil the show for me.  Unless the viewer is especially particular about the quality of DVD transfer, I recommend Reilly - Ace of Spies heartily.  This is high quality entertainment from beginning to end.",1122768000,81,3487,4.745847176079734

The series attempts to convey the era from the turn of the century in 1900 to post World War 1 Europe and possibly beyond with the activities of a British spy who infiltrated countries and pilfered valuable top secret information to the delight of the British Admiralty. Reilly first appears in Baku, where he has information of a secret report on Russian Oil exploration and info on middle east oil. Another assignment finds him in league with the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese war attack on Port Arthur. He also steals valuable plans from a German firm in charge of making guns for ships by working as a fireman. Later in perhaps the most interesting period, he is involved with representing the British and interacts with Lenin, Dzerzhinsky, and other familiar Bolsheviks during the period of the Russian revolution and executes a grand plot with Lockhart to topple the government in favor of placing himself as the head. Only Kaplan's shooting of Lenin after a factory speech spoils the timing of the revolt, or so we are led to believe. What is great about this series is the insight you receive during a somewhat murky period of Russian history, amist all of the womanizing, drinking, partying and debauchery that our hero engages in during his adventures. This is a VERY romanticized account of Reilly's life and concludes with the idea that he was killed by KGB agents under the charges earlier sentenced in absentia by a Bolshevik court for anit-revolutionary activity. Instead, he may have gone over to the Bolsheviks and may have still been operating during the second world war. His allegiances were always based on how much was being offered but he was still basically a Russian and there was evidence presented after this film was made that pointed to a possible defection. Sam Neill is excellent as Reilly and he has a host of familiar British actors surrounding him that are all veteran character players. This is an excellent work, well worth the viewing.",1111017600,21,2103,4.844444444444444

382452,5,6301928180,"At a time when the James Bond films were still novel and going strong, as were their imitators, British television viewers were watching a 10.5 hour, 12-part miniseries called ""Reilly, Ace of Spies."" Based on the biography by Robin Bruce Lockhart, this intriguing series is now available in a boxed set of 4 A&E DVDs (AAE-71748) and makes for some really gripping viewing.

 With Sam Neill in the title role, we follow the career of the man who taught British intelligence that if ruthlessness gets the job done, then ruthless spies are what they need. Sidney Reilly, an assumed name as is learned later, remains loyal to friends but not altogether to his employers and casual acquaintances. And if he treats his wives questionably when his job gets in the way, he makes up for it by treating all the other women with great feeling and tenderness.

 Having little patience with incompetence on any level, he gets a huge contract for battleships for Russia away from a British firm and to a German firm for which he works, he gets oil concessions, he steals plans by posing as a fire expert in Germany, and he finally tries to make himself head of a provisional government that will overthrow the Bolshevik regime. And so on.

 Along the way he runs into two great villains: Basil Zaharov (Leo McKern, who can say more with a look than most actors can with a page of text), and the icy head of Soviet Intelligence Felix Dzerzhinsky (Tom Bell), who has set up a phony organization that pretends to be against Stalin and rakes in millions from rich anti-Bolsheviks all over the world. A frightening moment comes when Stalin (David Burke) orders all in the group to be shot, because even following orders to appear disloyal ""is no excuse""! Which is what happens when personal power is far more important than human beings.

 Other major characters are Reilly's boss Cummings (Norman Rodway), his fellow agent Hill (Hugh Fraser), and an astute oriental police officer (David Suchet).

 Like another two series about spies, ""Tinker Tailor"" and ""Smiley's People,"" the story is complex, you never quite know at first who is who and who is lying more than the others. Except for some possibly supernatural business towards the end, you watch with both fascination and a vague disgust that this is what many people are really like-and that, from what we see, it is not the meek who are doing any inheriting.

 Fascinating and provocative viewing on a definitely ""adult"" level (i.e., lots of violence and a lot of naked flesh, the latter of which is pretty gratuitous). Neill does a marvelous job of portraying the complex and highly ambiguous main character.

 There is an interesting documentary of the real Reilly as a bonus feature, which should be seen after the series, not before.",1109203200,138,2776,4.7924528301886795

Sam Neill is superb, and the story is based on reality - the first real ""spy"" as we use the term today. Sidney ""Reilly"" was first and foremost an agent of the British government, and his actions and life centered on this fact.

382590,5,6301928180,"I'm not able to top another review written earlier on this series. I was prompted to read several books about Sidney Reilly after seeing this mini series.
Reilly was a real figure who worked as a sort of free lance agent for the then fledgling British Secret Service. The series follows Reilly from the beginning of his career in the Caucasus after stealing Russian oil exploration information, to his exploits of stealing battleship gun plans from a German shipyard, to his efforts to overthrow the Bolshevik regime in Russia. The story of Reilly is embellished somewhat for entertainment purposes, but, nevertheless, is still fairly accurate historically.
If you like a good yarn about history, and adventure then buy the series. You won't be disappointed.

As an addendum to this, a couple of books have been published that are a bit more scholarly. While Reilly is still an interesting historical character, much of what he claimed as been called into question. Nevertheless, this series is still worth watching.",997574400,13,1016,5.083832335329341
382591,5,6301928180,"I thoroughly enjoyed the series when it played on PBS. If you buy the four-cassette package, I think it gives you the whole series (not sure). The single cassette is the first cassette of the package. Confusing yes. Get the package. Unfortunately Amazon is out of stock indefinitely, but I was able to get it elsewhere.
The exploits of Sidney Reilly based on the book by Lockhart ""Reilly Ace of Spies."" There is a second book by Lockhart that supposedly corrects the first book. Reilly is truly the man of mystery, a single, double, triple ... agent, who knows? The major mystery about him is whether he perished in Russia or was turned. The series succeeds brilliantly on all levels. A must buy for any spy buff along with ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and ""Smiley's People.""",988416000,10,774,4.698529411764706
382592,5,6301928180,"Reilly: Ace of Spies  Thursday, November 26, 1998  by Ross Klatte
  I'm going to depart this week from my usual movie review to tout one of the best-produced and most interesting miniseries I've ever seen on  television. Reilly: Ace of Spies (1983-87) is a series made for British TV.
  The series, written by Troy  Kennedy-Martin and based on the book Ace of Spies by Robin B. Lockhart,  tells the story of an actual British agent in the early years of this  century who became the world's first international spy and the model, it's  said, for the fictional James Bond.
  Known as a womanizing  scoundrel as well as a master spy, Russian-born Sidney Reilly (his real  name was Rosenblum; he was the illegitimate child of his Austrian mother  and her Jewish lover, and he took an Irish name the better to operate in  the anti-Semitic Europe of his day), was a key espionage player during the  power-jockeying years leading up to the First World War. Among Reilly's  exploits, dramatized in this series, was his discovery of Russian oil  exploration in the Middle East, his stealing plans for the British of  German battleships before the war, and, most incredibly, his part in an  attempted overthrow of the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution. Among  his escapades was to marry more than once, unlawfully, and to yield to his  attraction to his half-sister.
  Sam Neill, his hair slicked down  and parted in the middle, looking very smart and turn-of-the-century, plays  Reilly with perfect credibility. (Lately, as in Jurassic Park and The Hunt  for Red October; he plays character roles; here he's a handsome leading  man.) He moves elegantly through the series, dressed impeccably as a  gentleman, sometimes disguised in working-class garb (once in black robes  as a Catholic priest), and exuding a sense of worldly calculation. Among  other fine actors in the series are Leo McKern, who plays the cynical and  scheming Basil Zaharov, John Rhys-Davies, and Jeananne Crowley as Reilly's  on-and-off-again wife Margaret. The series was beautifully shot to give us  the look and atmosphere of its European and Eastern settings in the years  1901 to 1918.
  In a memorable scene with his half-sister, in  which Reilly recounts his troubled relationship with their father and his  career in the years since they last saw each other, he admits to being a  spy and then nails down the qualifications:
  ""You have to  see life as a bit of a game,"" he says. ""And you have to have the  ability to manipulate people, I suppose.""
  The series was  directed by Jim Goddard, who also directed Shanghai Surprise, which  ""starred"" Sean Penn and Madonna when those two were briefly a  real-life couple, and which was such a bomb, I gather, that you can't find  it on video.
  Reilly: Ace of Spies, on the other hand, is  probably Goddard's prime effort. If I had the money, I'd order all four  videos from amazon.com.",967766400,57,2909,4.872427983539095
382593,5,6301928180,"After getting teased years ago by LPB's Mystery Theatre ran all the Episodes pertaining to Sidney Rosemblum aka Sidney Reilly. The series pretty well runs true to the ""Robin Bruce Lockhart's ""Reilly:Ace  of Spies"". Lockhart's Father was a member of the British Diplomatic  Corps during Russia's Lenin/Bolshivick revolution. Reilly worked  desperately to bring down Lenin and his cronies. Had he succeeded the world  would have been a much better place. And who knows WWII could have been  adverted. The series shows Reilly's exploits in a very truthful way. The  book, the entire VHS series show the true beginning of the Secret services  as we know today. Ian Fleming knew of Reilly's exploits and they served as  a stimulus to his James Bond series years later. Reilly ended up with a  bullet in his head trying to save Mother Russia. Stalin ,the Cheka (later  th KGB) saw the only way to end this potent threat was execution. This man  could have changed the 20th Century.
