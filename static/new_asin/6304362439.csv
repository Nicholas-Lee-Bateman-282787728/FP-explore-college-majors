7869078,4,6304362439,"This is one of those obscure videos about a particular time and place.  In this case, it is the East Village underground art scene in the early 80's.  If you like outrageous, this is for you.  Dean and the Weenies singing ""F*** You"" in artsy cool, the guy who bites the head off the rat then sets fireworks off on himself, Karen Finley's psychotic rant-as-art, Phoebe Legere singing about ""Marilyn"", truly capture an era that is, for the most part, gone.  It is both documentary and art entertainment.  You might like or not like what you see, but you won't be bored.",1238371200,,567,4.519607843137255
7869079,5,6304362439,"Mondo New York is a rare documentation of New York's East Village performance art scene when it was just about to boil over into the mainstream.  Many of the performers went on to become stars while others unfortunately died way too young (Charlie Barnett, John Sex),  shortly after the movie was produced.  This film is a must-see for anyone who is interested in the  New York underground art scene.  It may be the only chance for one to witness the energy of a lost decade.  The vitality of the performers is palpable.  I highly recommend this film to anyone interest in either performance art or New York subcultures.  Definitely a great snap shot of The City as it was in the 1980's.",1160006400,3,687,4.573770491803279
7869080,5,6304362439,"I found this movie in a very small down in the middle of no where. I was not able to secure the original copy of the movie, I did manage to get the original cover and a traditional dubbed copy.  I must say that this movie makes a great addition to my growing rare movie collection.  See this movie at least once if you can.",1038096000,2,323,3.953846153846154
7869081,4,6304362439,"This video is hard to find!  If you can get your hands on a copy, get it! It is based on the underground world of New York City's experimental artists.  Some scenes are shocking and may be too disturbing for those faint of heart.  The opening number performed by the phenomenal Phoebe Legere is worth the cost of the entire video alone.  Legere is said to have over four octaves and is able to play seven instruments.  She has the body of a Playboy centerfold and has a brain too.  She is a graduate of Vassar University in music composition.  In this video she does a very provocative homage to Marilyn Monroe.  The video also includes a lot of controversial acts including a man who bites off the heads of rats, cockfights, an authentic voodoo ritual with an animal sacrifice, and an assortment of other freakish performers including Lydia Lunch, Annie Sprinkle, and Joey Aria (all legends in the underground entertainment world).  It runs about 83 minutes but feels like it is less than an hour.",981072000,13,998,4.625
