8431649,5,B004J4XU8M,"""Here is a film that awakens in us an awareness as unsettling as it is exhilarating, a vision in which we are not victims of fate but ""response-able"" participants in the illusion shattering dance with destiny. The prophetic heart explores the true frontiers of consciousness, where past, present and future meld seamlessly into activist art, an inclusive pulsing web of which we are both but a single inextricable strand and one of the crucial conscious weavers. We learn that our work is not only to create a sustainable future, but to develop the presence and judgment necessary to discern what values and ways of being are truly worth sustaining. Even as we face political repression and wars, environmental destruction and a culture of distraction and denial, we are each being given an assignment and opportunity to create holistic alternatives. We see that our personal struggles are part of a shamanic process of falling apart and being remade, much as the tumultuous Earth Changes tell the story of a living planet restoring balance through dramatic transformation. We come away from watching this film not paralyzed with fear of the what so many have prophesied, but called to emboldened to attempt the so called ""impossible""..._called to be an active part of the shift and cure.""
