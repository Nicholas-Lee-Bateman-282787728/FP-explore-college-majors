1755901,4,B00006FMB1,"I like the For Dummies series. They are far more superior than the Idiot's Guide due to the way the books are laid out and the authors the publisher chooses.  Having this ""bias"" already, I was quite intrigued when I saw the DVD.  What the heck, let's try it out.  And the result is... not bad.
It's quick and dirty work out on all parts of the abdominal.  I got a kick out of it.  There are about 10 exercises in all plus warm up and cool down.  The music is light, the teacher smiles a lot (a bit much really), no fuss no frill, just getting down to business.  On the negative side, there are no pauses really between exercises.  You have to stop your DVD player between exercises especially if you are a beginner.  My guess is For Dummies is saving on run time. But at 12 bucks per DVD, I won't complain ... too much.  :)  Overall, I'm quite satisfied.  You'll like it if you have some training in abs already; you'll have an easier time to catch on.  It might be a bit hard for a beginner given the pace of the DVD.  But it shouldn't stop you from giving this a shot.  Just remember to pause in between exercises.  Oh and one more thing.  The DVD doesn't offer much exericse on the lower back (the opposite muscle group).  You should always work out on opposite muscle group to avoid imbalance of muscle strength.  So, do a few on your own.  There are much written in the way of what lower back exercises are, so I'll spare you the details here.  Have fun, and have a good sweat!!",1040601600,52,1483,4.1879432624113475
1755932,5,B00006FMB1,use this DVD when I was 26 and was very impressed with the results. I lost it when I moved but I repurchased it recently at 32 and I'm so happy I did. I do they 10 minutes fast track  workout at the end of the DVD every single day and it keeps my abs tight and in such a quick amount of time. I hate working out but just 10 minutes a day I can see results.,1362787200,,356,3.5641025641025643
1755933,5,B00006FMB1,I like the way it works. I try to workout three times a day. This dvd workouts are great at targeting the troubled areas. Thanks!,1362787200,,129,4.2
1755934,5,B00006FMB1,"I had a copy, used it faithfully for 5 years; had it all by memory, gave it away! Eventually forgot parts, so here I am again. Fine product for me, thanks!",1357603200,,155,4.032258064516129
1755935,5,B00006FMB1,I am thoroughly enjoying this dvd and do see results. Gaye is easy to follow and the routine is pleasant. The best ab workout I have done so far!,1322438400,,145,4.0344827586206895
1755936,4,B00006FMB1,"Most of these ""crunches"" are variations of Pilates exercises. They are well-presented, explained, and performed.  I am a Pilates instructor and they were a bit easy for me but I do them as an adjunct to my regular workout.  I love the warm-up -- sometimes I do it 3x just for a quick cardio workout!",1321574400,,299,4.418181818181818
1755937,5,B00006FMB1,"Borrowed this from my local library and liked it so much I bought it. Very simple to follow, background music can be turned off if annoying (it really isn't). Can do either a full hour or 10 minute routine. No equipment needed except a mat to lay on. Only issue was she doesn't keep count verbally so you have to keep an eye on the video or know how many reps she does.",1300838400,,369,4.068493150684931
1755938,5,B00006FMB1,I did the ab routine with Gay yesterday.  I was able to do 9 out of the ten exercises.  Today I have mild soreness in my abs.,1296950400,,125,3.5925925925925926
1755939,4,B00006FMB1,"Basic Ab Workout For Dummies is fifty-three minutes long and was released on DVD on September 24, 2002. Your instructor for this series is Gay Gasper. The workout is broken down to twelve different routines and that include the warm-up. The hardest of the routines is the warm-up because she does it at too fast a pace and I found it was hard to keep up with her. Most of the exercises are done lying on the floor. Baring the warm-up, I found only one or two that I had trouble with. I person in better shape and a first timer may be able to do all the exercises. I basically did two segments at a time. Still this is a good Abs work-out video. Basic Ab Workout For Dummies gets a B+.

1755954,5,B00006FMB1,I really like this ab workout but I esp. like the 10 minute ab blaster at the end. I don't always have time to do the whole tape but I usually can find 10 minutes!!,1231286400,,164,3.7142857142857144
1755955,5,B00006FMB1,"Ab Workout for Dummies is by far one of the best workouts you'll find.  The warm up is fun, easy to pick up on and she introduces you to many different exercises while explaining what area it works.  I was only able to do a few reps of the 1st 5 or 6 exercises starting out, and boy could I feel it the next day!  The instructor really knows her stuff and if I can get abs that look like hers, that's motivating!
As always, loved purchasing from Amazon as they always get the products to me very quickly and you can't go wrong with the super saver shipping!",1200009600,3,557,4.091743119266055
1755956,5,B00006FMB1,I have excercised to Gay Gasper's 10 minute Abs workout section for the past two years.  It absolutely works!  I used it consistently last year and was able to fit into my smallest clothes.  I briefly switched to another DVD and noticed that my clothes were tight again.  I started using the 10 minutes Abs workout DVD two months ago and my clothes feel wonderful again.  I am able to wear my pencil skirts without my stomach protruding.  I look great and feel great!,1147910400,8,467,4.5
1755957,4,B00006FMB1,"This is a routine of 10 basic crunches.  The format is easy to follow - but as one reviewer states - one must get up and manually stop the disk to really get a full handle on each crunch - not very sexy, ""fun"", or hip - yet, the detailed narrative is precisely where this presentation has its strength - once the exercise is mastered, one can take it to the gym and elaborate - this production has noticeably improved my ab workout and my abs.",1145059200,10,443,4.151162790697675
1755958,5,B00006FMB1,I've only done this workout a total of maybe 10 times. Each time I go through the full 10 sequences. It works! The next day I can definitely feel it as I am going about my day. I  recommend this workout for toning up your midsection. It doesn't take up much time and you will see a difference!,1127520000,9,293,4.051724137931035
1755959,4,B00006FMB1,The DVD is composed of 10 different ab exercises. They are easy to follow. You could really feel the difference after doing the exercises properly. The reason I am not giving it a 5 star is that it does not work the obliques enough.,1117497600,17,232,4.295454545454546
1755960,4,B00006FMB1,"I was quite intrigued by this video when I first saw it on the shelf and read the back cover, thinking "" What the heck, I'll give it a try."" I am impressed! From the very first workout, I could feel my abs really working and the very next day, believe it or not, I could actually see a difference! My stomach got flatter and my sides definitely narrowed. I am extremely pleased with this video and highly recommend it.  It is effective, fun and easy to follow. I'm just starting out with this workout, but I'm quite confident this is the one that will help me get leaner and more defined abs. Great workout!",1080864000,11,607,4.278260869565218
1755961,5,B00006FMB1,"I am a 66 year old female. (Not too many videos out there for people our age.) Although I appear younger. I'm an active person. I do aerobics, lifts weights and watch my diet. My problem has been with my stomach and flabby underarms or the triceps muscles.
When I first viewed this video with Gay Gasper. I thought this video wasn't for me. The instructor is too young and I won't be able to follow the workout, but after doing the workout with her, I was amazed how easy it was to follow each step.
Gay's explaination and slow execution of each step makes the workout easy and simple to undestand. I haven't had the video very long but I feel so much better when I am finished doing the exercises. I know I will be seeing positive results soon.
Even my husband who is not easily convinced with  exercise videos has been trying the video out. I have not been able to master the last ab exercise (Forearm Plank with Alternating Leg Lift). Ouch! it's painful and hard to do. (But my husband can do it!)  Oh Well, maybe it's the difference in the weight distribution and the strenght between us. But I will keep on trying. Overall, this is a great workout video for the abs. I recommend it to anyone regardless of age or sex.",1077321600,14,1222,4.331877729257642

It wasn't long until I was putting on a shirt and saw muscles down my side that I had never seen before. The technique is excellent and if you stick with this you will get results in a hurry, works for men and women.",1480896000,2,375,3.883116883116883

7968584,5,B00006FMB1,"Gay Gasper has created one of the best abdominal workouts I've ever tried. The secret is simple exercises anyone can do. You will be doing two sets of each exercise and there are 10 main exercises. I really felt this workout immediately after I was done. I was amazed that I could do over 200 repetitions. It seemed so easy and the time flew by. The only thing I found strange about this workout was Gay Gasper looks like she has a fake tan on her legs and stomach but she is pale from the neck up and doesn't look tanned on her arms either. This I found a little distracting for some reason. However the instruction is excellent and Gay doesn't make even one mistake. So perfectionists are going to love this workout.

~The Rebecca Review",1379980800,,739,4.394160583941606
7968585,5,B00006FMB1,"It seems overly simple at first blush if you've done crunches before - but it was full of such great reminders on proper technique, I found myself wishing every gym teacher and coach in school had made us watch this *before* ordering us to do all those sit-ups. You may have been doing them for years, but after watching this you'll realize you were probably doing most them inefficiently and wasting a lot of that time and energy.

I had planned on watching this once and giving it away, but I think this is great to keep and go back to, at least once a year, even if you are in another exercise program. She does a great job of cheerfully reminding you of some of the basics you might be cheating if you're in a hurry, or getting a bit lazy in your movements.

Starting with video structure: You're going to have a lot of 'pop-ups'. This may annoy some, but it keeps the texture uneven enough to become boring, I suppose. You'll see many of the same icons you may be familiar with if you've ever picked up a ""...for Dummies"" book. Have you played Mario Kart before? Then you're familiar with the music that'll be playing in the background. (I didn't say it was a high-budget production! :) just that it was great for getting basics down *correctly*). Many of the exercises have a pop-up interruption that will show you an easier and a more challenging form of the exercise, making it great for all ages and along a wider athletic spectrum.

The workout will start with a little bit of aerobics style moving to warm-up and stretch. She does a great job of calling out and counting down to the changes before they happen, so you can time yours correctly.

After that it's going to be all floorwork. Yes - everything from this point on is going to just seem like a variation on the basic crunch.  But!  What I really admired about this video was her almost preternatural ability to remind you of posture 'do's and 'don't's that you hadn't realized were creeping into your routine.  Just about the time you're thinking - 'This is simple. Duh. I know how to do this', you'll hear ""Drop your shoulders, don't let them curl up by your ears"" and guiltily realize you were doing just that. Or ""Don't let your gluts clench on this one, keep them loose, make your mid-section do all the work."" - you'll make that adjustment, too, and find the crunch movement just became twice as challenging.",1367366400,,2383,4.476958525345622
