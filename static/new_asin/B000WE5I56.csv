8222909,5,B000WE5I56,Live to Ride and Ride to Live!!! Awesome film.,1495497600,,46,4.222222222222222
8222910,2,B000WE5I56,Kier is cool.  This is not a shred video.  This is a documentary on the professional careers of 5 of snowboardings biggest stars.  If you give a hoot about thier opinions on snowboarding then you will be interested.  It was well edited.,1268697600,,236,4.5476190476190474
8222911,2,B000WE5I56,"this is an ok look at the lives of some of the Burton riders BUT they spend most of the time complaining about how hard snowboarding and life are. Most of the boarding footage is from the olympics in slow motion and boring as can be. This was unmotivating, actually it makes you want to AVOID snowboarding. I guess sowboarding isn't what it used to be, since big businesses got into it :(",1261872000,,388,4.328767123287672
8222912,5,B000WE5I56,"Can't believe how cool this film is, it's great to get into the mindset of these guys- I didn't really like Jeremy Jones or Kelly Clark but that was just because their personalities grated a bit with me, but still it was cool to hear their perspective. Has some superb shots of boarding too, but this is definitely more of a documentary than a full on snowboard movie.",1246924800,,368,4.426470588235294
8222913,3,B000WE5I56,"I have collected snowboard films since the early 80's so I'm old school.  Burton has sponsored some of the best riders out there.  Unfortunately, as someone mentioned in a previous post, this film has too much whining, complaining, and way too much Shawn White.  I really don't care about his refections on how awesome and cool everything is or that he bought his mother a lexus. If I'm forced to watch this kid, please drop the crappy dialogue and focus on actual riding. There was way too much contest footage and did we really need to slow the motion down?  Jeremy Jones has convinced himself that he's washed up when in fact he has many quality years ahead of him.  Jeremy, you need to focus on more powder, trust me, you'll feel better.  Once again, as in most snowboarding films, there is rarely a woman to be seen.  Burton decides to focus on the one with the biggest inferiority complex.  Kelly, if you really want to believe in something, believe in yourself!  You are one of the hottest women riders out there.  You unfortunately have been sucked into the whole contest scene.  A scene that used to be fun before big business got involved.  I would have liked to have seen more Terje and Dave Downing.  It's nice to see Dave still rips but I would have liked to have seen more.  I guess I long for the days of ""Snowboarders in exile.  While Jeremy did his share of complaining he made the finest rail sequence I've ever seen and I hate rail footage.  the Russia and Alaska footage was by far the best in the film.  Burton did an ok job of representing many aspects of snowboarding, just way too much on the contest scene.  I think we've lost focus on what snowboarding is really about.",1228003200,6,1695,4.465798045602606
8222914,3,B000WE5I56,i'm a gap jump guy and this has almost nothing as far as that goes.  it attempts to tell a story rather than just be a montage of different people and different tricks at different locations.  it could also have been titled shaun white goes to the olympics.  plenty of pipe action.,1206662400,,281,4.365384615384615
8222915,1,B000WE5I56,"If you want to to be unmotivated and not go snowboarding, this is the video for you!  Half of the movie is the snowboarders of the Burton team complaing how snowboarding is a chore and how life is hard.  The other half is stock footage from the olympics in incredibly boring slow motion.  Yes, Shaun White can rip with the best.  Yes, Jeremy Jones can shred things that probably aren't supposed to be ridden.  The riders in this video are amazing.  Unfortunately, this video is about as fun to watch as atrip to the dentist office. They didn't even have DCP in there.  If they did, it was bare minimum. I would Suggest any Mack Dawg video or better yet the Think Thank videos (ie; Thanks, Brain).  Overall, the Burton movie was un-motivating, whiny and is more of a soap opera than a snowboarding video.",1203033600,5,803,4.489655172413793
8222916,5,B000WE5I56,Very fun... excellent shots... great music and you get to know more about a snowboarder life.,1202688000,,93,4.875
8222917,4,B000WE5I56,This was a very interesting DVD as it shows what it is like behind the scenes for these professional snowboarders.  It gives you a personality to put with each of the riders.  If you are expecting a more tradional snowboard video then this might not be what you're looking for.  While it shows a good amount of riding it is not tradional in the sense of stock snowboarding clips set to a soundtrack.  Overall a good DVD though.,1198800000,9,427,4.435897435897436
