2052829,5,B00020HA9C,You have no idea how long I have been waiting for the Garfield specials to come out on DVD.

But I have grown into a big fan.  In fact, I have some Brazilian cousins I tried to hook with his wry humor.  I too have all his books, seen all his television specials and have wondered too, ""When are all of my favorite ""fat tabby's"" specials coming to dvd.

As for Garfield Gets a Life, I don't remember it every being aired on CBS. Anyway, I have enjoyed watching these three specials on DVD.

2052839,5,B00020HA9C,"If you only THINK that you're a Garfield fan, and you haven't seen these TV specials, then you must not be a TRUE fan at all. These are three spectacular specials that must be seen by every Garfield fan in the entire Solar System! ""Here Comes Garfield"", ""Garfield on the Town"", and ""Garfield gets a Life"" are classic, because they show an unusual dramatic quality that are almost never found in present-day cartoons. This is definintely a must-see!

Grade: A",1231027200,,458,4.725
2052840,5,B00020HA9C,"""Garfield as Himself"" brings together Garfield's first two television specials from the early '80's, plus one more from the early '90's, on one DVD! It's a must have for the Garfield fan of any age!

First, it's ""Here Comes Garfield"", Garfield's 1982 television debut! In this story, which stars the late, great Lorenzo Music as the fat cat he voiced to fame and Sandy Kenyon as the original voice of Jon Arbuckle, Garfield's ""pal"" Odie gets hauled off to the pound thanks to a cranky neighbor. Soon, it's Garfield to the rescue! One can easily see where the live-action Garfield film of 2004 borrowed some of its truest moments from this television classic! This one was nominated for 2 Primetime Emmy awards. I'm amazed that while this one didn't win one, the next special did.

That next special is 1983's ""Garfield on the Town"", and don't get me wrong, it's good, but I prefer the former. This one is a bit sappier, like the Garfield Christmas Special was, with a truly sappy song I find a little irritating, ha. But it's an enjoyable adventure anyway, as Garfield gets lost in town and discovers the Italian restaurant where he was born, not to mention his long lost family! Thom Huge taking over as the voice of Jon is another plus for this one.

Finally, we pick up with Garfield many TV specials later with his only post '80's special, ""Garfield Gets a Life"". Actually, this one turns out to be more about Jon getting a life, or more specifically, a date. More in the spirit of the ""Garfield and Friends"" TV series of the time, this one has the most laughs of them all and is still a nice little story, though a very simple one.

""Garfield as Himself"" features cover art of modern Garfield viewing his earlier, and frankly, uglier incarnation in a mirror. It's a great image for the cover of this DVD. There's one extra, a behind the scenes look at the first live-action Garfield movie. If you're a fan of Garfield, you'll definitely want to pick it up along with the famous ""Garfield Holiday Celebrations"". You'll also need ""Garfield Fantasies"", ""Garfield Travel Adventures"", the ""Garfield and Friends"" TV show, and I also recommend the two live-action films. The live-action films are flawed, but I feel they are mostly good. Garfield and Odie are well done in them, but while I liked the casting, Jon and Liz aren't written as they were for the comics and cartoons (Nermal and Arlene weren't done right either, but they're not even in ""A Tale of Two Kitties""). Whatever you pick up though, you'll definitely want this one and the holiday DVD! Oh, how I miss the days of the primetime cartoon special!",1211760000,,2611,4.657266811279826
2052841,4,B00020HA9C,"The cover of this DVD shows the 1998 Garfield gazing in the mirror at his early 1978 self, the subject of these three specials. In 1980, Mt. St. Helen's blew it's top, and Garfield's first book, Garfield at Large, topped the New York Times bestsellers list. Two years later, Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, the team that brought Peanuts to the screen, unleashed Jim Davis' fat cat in his first prime time special, Here Comes Garfield. His first special was an Emmy award nominee, but the next year he took the Emmy with 1983's Garfield on the Town, and returned in a disco-era update, Garfield Gets a Life. Each of these specials was originally released on video, and all three are now together on this bargain-priced DVD for a flashback trip with Garfield down memory lane.",1106956800,2,775,4.705882352941177
2052842,5,B00020HA9C,"I pratically grew up on Garfield cartoons ever since i was young, i'm sooo glad that these specials are finally on DVD!

The first one "" Here comes Garfield"" is the first Garfield special ever which introduces everyone's favorite fat orange furball as he with Odie the lovable dumb dog get into big trouble then head to the pound where Garfield must free Odie. Then "" Garfield on The Town"" has our hero escaping from Jon taking him to the vet by being in the big city streets to meet his long lost mother and battle some mean alley cats. Finally in "" Garfield gets a Life"" Garfield with Jon are sooo bored with their lives they decide to change it for once including trying to find the perfect girl for Jon.

A great collection of classic garfield cartoons for the entire family and great for both kids and adults alike.",1099612800,2,820,4.423841059602649
2052843,5,B00020HA9C,"The TV specials ""Here Comes Garfield"", ""Garfield On The Town"" and ""Garfield Gets A Life"" are finally on DVD. The TV specials were originally on short videotapes released in the early '90s and we rented just about all of them several times.
Now after all these years, they have been discovered again due to the popularity of the new movie, these three original 24 minute TV specials will now be preserved forever because you can't find these anywhere else unless you own the old tapes and they're worn out. The picture quality is very sharp and rich in color. Garfield's TV specials as well as the aimated series was always a very colorful show. The sound, although in mono, sounds better than ever an is more crisp. The DVD quality far exceeds the VHS quality. Also available on this disc is a fantastic Spanish language track (great if kids want to learn another language), plus there are Englsih and Spanish subtitles. As a bonus, there is a short ""Inside Look"" on the new Garfield movie.
Within the packaging of this DVD is the listing of the programs and the chapter stops, and a little booklet promoting Garfield's website, the three TV programs in their comic book editions fitted into a ""fat cat 3-pack"" comic book called ""Garfield As Himself"" with the same design as the DVD. I grew up watching Garfield and was practcially raised on Garfield. I'm glad to see he has regained enough popularity again to be preserved on DVD. ""Garfield and Friends"" was on different stations, but on the station I used to see it on it had been taken off the air. Disappointing! However, with this 3-disc set of volume 1 of the animated series coming out soon, you can finally see them again.
I can't wait! In the booklet for ""Garfield As Himself"" it says to look for more TV specials on DVD. How does this sound for the next disc: ""Garfield Goes Hollywood"", ""Garfield In The Rough"" and ""Garfield In Paradise""? I would love to see it soon. For now if you love Garfield, this is the first DVD available so act now!
HERE COMES GARFIELD!",1090195200,2,2022,4.588397790055248
2052844,5,B00020HA9C,"I was so happy when I heard this DVD was going to be released as I can never get enough of the fat cat's sardonic wit.  I have now watched each of the three episodes several times and am hoping even more are released soon.
HERE COMES GARFIELD, the first selection, opens with Garfield strutting his stuff in a great dance number while Lou Rawls sings.  The episode is filled with great ""Garfieldisms"" like ""I hate mornings.  I'd like them better if they started later"" and ""Show me a good mouser and I'll show you a cat with bad breath.""  The plot has a lot of similarity to the 2004 big-screen movie.  Odie, the hapless dim-witted dog, is picked up by the pound and Garfield decides to break him out.
GARFIELD ON THE TOWN is a nostalgic episode.  A trip to the vet takes an unexpected turn when, unnoticed by Jon, Garfield falls out of the car.  While lost and roaming the unknown streets he encounters a herd of alley cats with a lot more street-smarts than the tubby tabby possesses.  He seeks cover in a place that is eerily familiar and we soon find out that this is the kitchen of the Italian restaurant where Garfield was born and experienced his first lasagna.  His mom still lives there and, of course, she recognizes Garfield immediately and introduces him to his brother, grandfather, cousins, and more.  Unfortunately, Garfield will never fit in as they are dedicated mousers and we know how he feels about that!  An action-packed rumble between Garfield's family and the alley cats ensues and Garfield is saved and led back to his true home with Jon and Odie.  But this touching glimpse of his connection with his mother is outstanding.
GARFIELD GETS A LIFE finds Jon bored with his situation and desperately attempting to meet girls at clubs, laundromats, video stores, any place he can think of.  He and Garfield finally wind up at Lorenzo's School for the Personality Impaired  where Jon does indeed meet a girl he adores.  She is wild about Jon as well, but unfortunately she is allergic to cats. This is cute and clever, though it's a no-brainer as to the choice Jon will make.
If you love Garfield, you will love this DVD.  His ""original"" voice as performed by the late Lorenzo Music and the great writing of Jim Davis combine to make this a five-star treat for fans.",1090022400,20,2286,4.57985257985258
2052845,5,B00020HA9C,"It's taken long enough. But now, with the release of the Garfield movie, seems to be the best time for the fat cats DVD debute. There are 3 TV specials on this DVD, all directed by Phil Roman (Producer of The Simpsons, The Critic, King of the Hill).
The first is 'Here Comes Garfield' from 1982
Most feature-length movies achieve only half of what Here Comes Garfield does. Even though it's only 24 minutes long. Garfield and Odie may have a love/hate relationship but deep down they need each other.
The feline and the canine torment an old neighbor, who promptly calls the animal pound, who takes Odie away. Garfield bids good riddance but later at night the guilt and dread of a missing Odie overpowers him and he sets about rescuing him from the pound.
Garfield may have come from a simple comic strip but there are some touching moments in this TV Special that prove why he has been so consistently popular for the past 25 years.
The animation mimics Jim Davis' early incarnation of Garfield (this was made in 1982) and although it's not as refined as the modern Garfield he's still the same great, fat cat. The late Lorenzo Music is his voice (or thoughts), though Thom Huge is not the voice of John, he would appear in the further TV Specials and the later TV Series.
A genuine classic.
Second up is 'Garfield on the Town' from 1983.
We all know how much Garfield hates going to the vet. So after wrecking Jon's house the fat cat is dragged, kicking and screaming, into the car. But even on the way there Garfield can't sit a peace. Until he falls out of the window and into the busy street.
He quickly learns that freedom from Jon and life on the streets isn't all fun and games. No one is kind to him, he's cold and quickly hungry. So when he dips into a smelly garbage can he's met with hostility from a punk alley cat.
Being house cat and used to home comforts, Garfield cannot match the aggression of this alley cat. More so when a hundred of them (looking more like the Critters from the movie of the same name, than alley cats) come after him.
Garfield takes refuge in an old building which just happens to be Italian Restaurant where he was born. There he meets him mother and the rest of his family. Tho he doesn't belong. And Garfield learns that his real family is Jon and Odie.
It's a very sweet natured story and the ending is cute and touching. There is a good reason why it won an Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.
Lastly we have 'Garfield gets a Life' from 1991.
In this TV special Jon is the one who needs a life. The highlight of his day is counting the tiles on the ceiling and rearranging his sock drawer. Not content with this forever, Jon takes Garfield to a self help group in order to meet people. How many people will be interested in a loner 20-something who's best friend is a cat?
After several failed attempts at getting a girl, including one cringeworthy dance scene that rivals David Brents' fusion of Flashdance and MC Hammer in The Office (Disco's dead?, says Jon), he is more than shocked to find a cute girl who is as much as a jerk as himself.
Naturally, they get on but Garfield is worried that John will forget about him and prefer having kids to a cat. Fortunately Jon's new girlfriend is allergic to cats.
With slicker animation than past TV specials, this feels like a longer episode of Garfield and Friends.
The DVD sports a 1.33:1 picture that presents the animation far cleaner and better than the old VHS tapes ever did. The sound is plain old Mono but it does the trick. The only extra is a brief featurette on the Garfield movie. I do wish Fox would release another DVD like this with other Garfield TV specials like 'Garfield in the Rough', 'Garfield in Paradise' and 'A Garfield Christmas'.
But just get this 'un to tide you over until the Garfield and Friends: Season 1 DVD come out.",1089504000,9,3845,4.432203389830509
2052846,5,B00020HA9C,"The Garfield specials playing on TV had slowly gone from being played several times per year to a trickle of only the Halloween and Christmas specials being played just once per year to finally not being played at all.  The VHS tapes had been out of print for years and were selling in upwards of $30 for a single Special on eBay... the world was crying out for the Garfield Specials to be released on DVD.  Finally some of them are here! The old Garfield specials are better than ever in super high quality digital.
