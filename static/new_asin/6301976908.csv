1. Tweetie Pie (1947, Freleng; Academy-Award Winner and the first appearance of Sylvester and Tweety in the same cartoon)
2. A Tale of Two Kitties (1942, Clampett; first appearance of Tweety)
3. The Gruesome Twosome (1946, Clampett; starring Tweety)
4. Birdy and the Beast (1944, Clampett; starring Tweety)
5. Life With Feathers (1945, Freleng; Academy-Award Nominee and first appearance of Sylvester)
6. Crowing Pains (1947, McKimson; starring Sylvester, Foghorn Leghorn, Henery Hawk, and Barnyard Dawg)
7. Back Alley Oproar (1948, Freleng; starring Sylvester and Elmer Fudd)
8. I Taw a Putty Tat (1948, Freleng; Sylvester/Tweety)

So, there's actually only 2 cartoons with Sylvester and Tweety both in the same cartoon, but it's still a great set!",1296864000,2,834,5.358778625954199
