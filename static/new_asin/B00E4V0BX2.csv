It's like you go to a fancy restaurant and order a juice steak and you receive...a stone. Twist and shouts warehouse I am not going to have any business with you again!!!",1422835200,,286,4.72
8601085,5,B00E4V0BX2,"For the longest time, whenever I would pull up youtube videos of America's songs, I would see them playing in this setting, which looked as though they were in someone's garage or basement.  Finally, I checked into it and discovered that the video clips I was watching came from this television special.  When you watch it, you'll get the feeling that the band was really uncertain of what the producers had in mind.  After the first song, ""Ventura Highway"", one of the guys asks, ""So how is this gonna work?  Can we do another take if we're not happy?  Because I'd like to do that one again.""  An off-camera voice tells them to keep going.  This is not to say that the quality of the recordings is not great.  To the contrary, it shows what perfectionists these guys were, because I cannot hear a note out of place.  If you're a fan of America, you will not be disappointed with this purchase.",1413676800,,894,4.469135802469136
8601086,3,B00E4V0BX2,THis is pristine recording and in studio recorded live concert with no audience.  However you can just search for America: The Best Of MusikLaden Live (1975) and spend $10 less than this ticket price of $17.  To me this American capitalism at its worst.,1380153600,,253,4.7272727272727275
