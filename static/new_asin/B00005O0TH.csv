1638233,3,B00005O0TH,"With BLue Gender we are thrust into a post-apocoliptic future where man has been driven off Earth by a new type of vicious species that can eat anything organic (like humans) or in-organic.  These hige insect like creatures have taken over the planet.  The story begins with an apparent rescue mission of some survivors who were placed into cryo-sleep before the disastor.  Things go wrong from there.  The story is very promising but has a few flaws that may or may not drive you crazy.  For example, the main character Kaido is a coward, and an annoying one at that.  Character development is minimal and at times uninteresting.  Otherwise, a very promising anime if a few things are improved with the next disc.",1003795200,4,714,4.7560975609756095

1638235,4,B00005O0TH,"If your basic Japanese anime were melded with ""Starship Troopers,"" the result might be something like ""Blue Gender."" Better plotted than ""Troopers,"" ""Blue Gender"" is an entertaining if uneven series, the first three episodes of which are here (along with extras such as audio commentary and character profiles).
Yuji Kaido is an ordinary kid from a few years in the future, living an ordinary life... until he's diagnosed with a strange, incurable virus. His only hope to to enter artificial hibernation until a cure is found. Theoretically, it wouldn't be long. But he wakes into a world gone wild, and is nearly devoured by monstrous insects the size of trucks. He's barely rescued by humans driving enormous robots, who were sent to bring him back.
Yuji discovers that twenty-two years have passed, and it is now 2031. While he was sleeping, the earth was overrun by these insects, called ""Blues,"" which devour organic and inorganic alike and have reduced civilization to a pack of on-the-run soldiers. They were ordered to bring all the sleepers back to a space station where they all live, but a Blue attack kills all the sleepers except Yuji. Determined not to be babied by the present-day humans any longer, Yuji decides to fight for his life.
A pretty typical plot, and as a cartoon it sounds doomed. But despite the anime look of the characters, the action scenes, settings, and the Blues themselves are quite realistic-looking. One problem is that the action scenes themselves are a little repetitive, if well-done -- bloody, weird, full of violence and gnashing insects.
The Blues are one of the bonuses -- as they act like real insects, only thousands of times the size. Nor do they seem evil, just animalistic. Though alien invasion is nothing new, we're given a good means of finding out what is going on, by having a clueless hero. And time is taken to build up the sense of desolation, loneliness, and destruction that the Blue have brought to Earth, and how civilization has been wrecked by them.
Fuji will, without a doubt, irritate the heck out of viewers at first. When first rescued from the Blue, he whines, shrieks, freezes in danger, and generally acts irrationally - although given his circumstances you can't really blame him for going bonkers. There's certainly promise of improvement; he does grow on you with time. Marlene just comes across as cold at first, but gradually we see some softening. Most of the supporting characters are a lot harder to keep straight, especially since quite a few die.
While not particularly original, ""Blue Gender"" is a solid scifi story, with the king of darkness and violence usually found in major action movies. Though the characters are a bit hard to warm up to, it's overall an entertaining show.",1060041600,7,2762,4.891257995735607
1638236,5,B00005O0TH,"I must say that I really enjoyed this DVD. The story starts with a basic aliens-take-over-the-world style plot. But even the first three episodes show that this anime isn't as cliche as it first appears. First off the mechs look like they might be buildable, which is more than can be said for Gundam in any of it's incarnations (not putting Gundam down in any way, it is just that their mechs do complex movements that don't seem possible when the cockpit is seen). Then there is the blue themselves (those aforementioned aliens invading the earth). They also seem somewhat believable because they are so similar to insects that can be seen in real life, only much bigger and meaner.
The base personalities of the different characters are laid out in these episodes. It is hard to tell just from these, but they seem like they are going to turn out to be more complex then they first appear. The voice acting is great. All of the main characters are voiced by people who have worked on DBZ, but that isn't a bad thing. They seem to have been given more natural roles in this show because they are much more convincing. The animation is also great. I haven't noticed any looping or re-using of animation yet, a thing that plagues some other shows. It is also creatively violent. There are bug bits and broken people in most of the major scenes. Think Starship Troopers style violence and you'll get a good idea of what I'm getting at.
The DVD itself is great as well. The layout doesn't go out of the way to be annoying or confusing. This means straight forward and easy to use menus that are still worth looking at. The extras are also good. There is the standard assortment of trailers. There are also character bios that show who does the voice acting and what else they have worked on (a feature that I personally loved, it humanizes the voice actors). The rough sketch gallery is cool to look at because it gives the average person a small look into the planning that has to go into any animation. There is also a first for me: an audio commentary. It consists of the voice director and the two main voice actors discussing different, and usually interesting, things while the first episode plays in the background. Over all great extras for an anime.
Bottom Line: If you like sci-fi with good mechs, aliens that like to spew when they die, good animation, good dubbing, and a promising story line then get this DVD.",1034380800,14,2421,4.555045871559633
1638237,4,B00005O0TH,i purchased this dvd on word of great iternet reviews and liked it on most condtions except for few minor tweaks here is how it rounds. +'s:exclent feautures like special feautures and the bilingual languages also the plot.-'s:just one big problem the animation isn't very well drawn. overall its agood series but make sure you check out the commentary.,1017705600,,353,5.0
1638238,2,B00005O0TH,"I purchased this anime on the word of a friend. I regret this purchase very much. The animations are half decent. That is the only partially redeeming part of this DVD. The story lacks imagination, the characters are annoying and predictable, the dialogue is bland and tedious, and the nudity has no point. It has no part in the story at all. At one point a pilot just walks up to an android a pulls of her shirt. It did not even build his character because he was not even a main character. The main character is a whining brat. Five minutes into the film you wish he were dead. The action scenes were repetitive, dull, and predictable. I know this review is nothing but one huge complaint. People must be warned though. This is quite possibly the worst anime I have ever seen.",1013385600,3,778,4.409722222222222
1638239,5,B00005O0TH,"Blue Gender was great, especially when watched at 1:00 in the morning!  A tad bloody, violent, and traumatizing, Blue Gender is just a pile of fun.  My favourite char is Joey... my friends and I call him the head-bobber.  (Ever notice that?)  Marlene scares me with how stoic she is... Yuji? Eh, he's Yuji.  Defintely check out Blue Gender whenever you get the chance!",1011398400,,368,4.6875
1638240,5,B00005O0TH,"This series deserves more credit than it has received.
First off, the voice acting is excellent. As they explain on the DVD, the voice acting is done by the actors who voiced out both young Trunks (Marlene in BG) and future Trunks (Yuji in BG). They also tell you that they recorded all of the scenes at late hours in the night when no one was there and all of the lights were turned off- to give them even more of a weirded out feeling.
The subtitles also match up to the acting, which is excellent to see. I get really tired of the subtitles being totally different from the speech- it gets ridiculous.
The animation is nothing spectacular. For a new series, and with things like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun out there, you would expect some better animation. It doesn't detract, but for those of you who have seen the other series, you can see how much potential it has to be excellent with great animation.
The story is well done. I actually haven't seen much anything like it. The 'mysterious alien race' has been done before; however the awakening that Yuji received after hibernating an illness off is a new touch that I like. I think its good having a character that pretty much relates exactly to the audience- learning as he goes. We see everything he learns about what happened, and that is great to see. Narratives work well to explain things in anime, and it's good to see that Blue Gender fit it into the plot so well.
The action is superb. Cowboy Bebop has better hand to hand fighting scenes, but the mech combat in Blue Gender is the best of its kind I've seen in anime. Much like Gasaraki (another great one), they use the 'mecha' armors more like tools in battle than suits like armor. Sort of like walking tanks that are very difficult to control. Also: none of the mechs are the same, which shadows Gundam Wing. But in GW, each gundam had his own uniqee weapon, but they didn't look far off from eachother. In BG, one mech has a large cannon, and another uses these huge arms to smash things. That one also needs two pilots, one for the arms (a cool touch). The basic fighting physics and everything are realistic, including ALL OF THE BLOOD. (pretty gore scenes-faces through windows and heads bashed against walls of vans...)
The characters are okay thus far. Off the top of my head I don't remember their names...The only complaint I can see with the characters is that they teach Yuji a little too quickly how to pilot the mechs. It almost seems that they just wanted the 'relating-to-a-teen-audience character' to just hurry up and get into the mech...Although its reasonably important that he learns how to pilot it: at one point Marlene feels he shouldn't know anything, and an hour later it seems she wants him to pilot their most valuable asset....just too quick of a transition.
All in all this anime really delivers. It gives you a cold, dead feeling of a destroyed world like few others do. Robotech rebuilt all of their cities in like 1 episode, so the desolate Earth was never explored. In BG, you see a modern city totally taken over by the blue, and no one, absolutely no one is there. I love it.",1009670400,4,3128,4.508802816901408
1638241,3,B00005O0TH,"When I saw the adds for this anime, it looked like a good hit!  I never heard anything like it before and it sounded like it could be good.  When i finally got it and watched the first episode, i was pretty disapointed.  Dont get me wrong, it was bpretty good, but it just wasn't AS GOOD as I expected.
After about a week, i got the courage to watch the other episodes on the DVD, and i was much impressed on how it picked up.  While still not up to my expectations, the series got better with every episodes and i dared to preorder the next volume just to see what is goin to happen.
Check this out if you have the money to do so, it definetly shows promise.",1007337600,,659,4.00763358778626
1638242,5,B00005O0TH,"When i first got this on pre-order i was skeptical if I was doing the right thing. Well I am definatly glad a bought it. I prefer the dark, morbid, bloody plot over most things. And believe me this is filled with it. it is kinda confusing at first, but I listened closely and instantly fell in love with it. The dubbed version isn't far off from the subtitled and the voices match perfectly, for most the characters.",1005436800,3,416,4.346153846153846
7948099,4,B00005O0TH,"I prefer anime that isn't really creepy or silly. Blue Gender has a little of everything, including the weird, creepy, existential, preachy, and yes, sometimes just silly, but it's action was exciting and some of the moments are my favorite in anime.  There's something in all anime that's just kinda weird, is it lost in translation from Japanese or what? Maybe it's just me. But this show was a good weird apocalypse story, with a much better ending than Neon Genesis, which I started to like then watched in horror as it just kinda mutilated itself into a messy pulp of self loathing.

Blue Gender's very different... for being a total copycat of other stories, namely Starship Troopers. At least it's creators liked the show and made it as entertaining as it is ridiculous.

If too much doom and gloom puts you off you probably won't enjoy it. Considering the story's about teens forced into a war it's not exactly fun for the whole family. However if you can get over the lead's panic attacks and spine chilling suspense music out of your nightmares you might enjoy the ride.

And the theme song is catchy.",1511481600,,1111,4.682051282051282

7948101,5,B00005O0TH,"I remember watching the first episode back at 2008 from my computer desktop, and including the commercial. Some people back at 1999, 2001, and 2002 loved it. The comments that I checked from the one star are probably trolls who never watched this show before. I mean, look at their comments date. The one who said this sucked who don't have knowledge, and logic. Beside, that is what shills would say when they have no brain. Just like those people from show. For examples, victims of the Blue. The person who said it sucked need a life, gezz man your creating a total mind games chaos. Open your knowledge, and live your life together. You think Blue Gender was that bad? Think again, I watched the whole episodes back at 2015. If you say something that you never watched. Don't create a hate comment, or else someone will report or a curse will set upon you.

7948105,1,B00005O0TH,"Horrible animation style, over the top acting, shallow characters, and too much like Starship Troopers are just some of the reasons I hate this anime.",1369440000,,150,5.04
7948106,3,B00005O0TH,"Blue Gender has that old anime look: the limited use of colors with an emphasis on primary colors like blue and green, the slightly blurry animation, the facial feature styles like Voltron.  I looked up the date of release in Japan, expecting it to be early 8o's (although it's pretty violent for seach an early anime.)  I was surprised to see that the Japan release date was 1999.

This anime is hardcore, fast-moving, action-oriented horror/sci-fi.  If you can stomach humans being dismembered and rolled up into green balls, bug guts and lots and lots of green and red blood, then you will enjoy the post-apocalyptic mecha anime.

Much has been said about the main character whining.  Considering what he goes through, I would whine like a b**tch too, and probably faint after crapping me pants.  At least he tries to fight back.",1220054400,,832,4.816901408450704
7948107,4,B00005O0TH,"I completely disagree with the earlier review. This anime was fantastic. With each episode you watch the main 2 characters transform, their ideas their views their decisions. The action scenes will keep you glued to your chair, and if you dare to even put yourself in the character's shoes.. you'll be cold sweating with each episode... this was freaking awesome!",1216512000,,363,5.066666666666666
7948108,3,B00005O0TH,"They have done it again.  Not only do you get a gratingly annoying lead character who does nothing more than whine throughout this whole DVD, but you also have the (dis)pleasure of seeing giant alien bugs with especially sexual mouths that resemble the female nether-region.  Try watching this one for more than two minutes without wanting to smack the TV and/or go watch some porn.  Other than that, it can be pretty good.",1064275200,2,423,4.767123287671233
