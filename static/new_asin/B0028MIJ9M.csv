8356401,5,B0028MIJ9M,"Great addition to his LAOH. Covers some great takedowns for the Street or Ring.  I loved the flow from the baseball throw to the double wristlock throw. Very well detailed. I have his LAOH andthe Snap no Tap volumes 6 Groundfighting ,Vol 5 Standing Submissions and this one. All top notch. The Snap, No Tap is much more streamlined and concise. I do like his sense of humor in his training.",1420070400,,390,4.492957746478873
8356402,4,B0028MIJ9M,"Snap no Tap Vol. #5 covers the basic standing submissions taught in Cecchine's system. These are nothing really new, but do provide a difference in application and use compared to other styles of martial arts. These submissions are easy to learn and do work from tie ups, grabs, ect. A welcome supplement to the series.",1308441600,2,319,4.818181818181818
8356403,1,B0028MIJ9M,"Phony Cecchine thinks he's a wrestler. But he's never had a pro fight. He's never won a tournament. But he thinks he can beat anyone. I remember watching Lost Art Of Hooking. This guy considers a wrist lock a ""lost art"". That was the most boring, dumbest thing I've ever seen. I don't know why Phony Cecchine thinks he's a wrestler. He can't keep up with any of his lies. He claims he's learned everything from Lou Thesz. Then he put some edited video up on YouTube. All Lou Thesz said was that they're good friends, he never said word for word ""I taught Tony everything that he knows about wrestling."". If Phony Cecchine has never had a pro fight, or a tournament fight how is he so sure he methods can beat anybody.
Do yourself a favor, look for commercial videos put out by real athletes. They make commercial videos too. Phony Cecchine goes under other names and talks bad about anyone who points out questions like mine.",1304899200,,925,4.479289940828402
