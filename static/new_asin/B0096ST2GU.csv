5274484,4,B0096ST2GU,"If you are a fan of legendary Barbara Stanwyck this is a great set for you,4 of the films have a young 22 to 25 yr old Barbara,great pre-code movies,I went 4 stars because movies are 5 star,packaging is 3 stars ,could be packaged better,much better!
I have learned how the strange packaging works not as bad as i first said,but not as good as should be,the big mistake is not advertzing that 4 out of 5 are Barbara Stanwyck,I would have bought this long ago had I know that,I only became aware when i got a heads up on another review",1362614400,4,533,4.235294117647059
5274485,5,B0096ST2GU,Especially love the commentary!  Really makes the movie experience personal. Never realized Barbara Stanwyk was so insecure as an actress.,1356825600,,138,5.9
5274486,5,B0096ST2GU,"I am a big fan of pre-code films.  This Collection is actually the way they were seen back than, as opposed to the Columbia Pre-Code Collection.  In that Collection each film is cut so that they are in fact censored.
I am happy to be able to get these films.  Ms Stanwyck is great and it is special to see her early work. To think how long she survived in Hollywood is incredible in itself.
I will never get over how this Country allowed the god squad to decided what they were going to watch. The themes in these early movies, Silents included, was reality of life as it was then.  I resent the fact that so many are just not available anymore for any price.  Sad to me.
I also purchased Baby Peggy-another great silent star that almost went by the wayside.  She was a fine actress. I recommend her movies to any silent fan out there who does not know about her.
Oh and I am looking for The Scarlett Letter-1926 if anyone knows where to get it.",1355270400,2,945,4.222222222222222
5274487,5,B0096ST2GU,"It is gratifying that TCM have decided to issue a box set of restored prints of these early Frank Capra films, 4 of which star Barbara Stanwyck. These are Columbia releases, issued by Sony, and it was Capra who raised the status of the company to major league. Those familiar with the later, more famous Capra titles maybe in for a surprise because there is no evidence of Capra ""corn"" here at all.  Here is a brief summary of each film:

- ""Ladies of Leisure"" is ""The Woman in Red"", 1930 style. Ralph Graves plays an artist who paints Barbara Stanwyck. He is from a wealthy family, of course, and she is from the streets. This was the film in which Frank Capra ""discovered"" Stanwyck and the film is a loving tribute to her talents. She was not a trained actress and brought a natural raw talent to the screen. Capra was able to nurture and guide her and his direction is impeccable. Stanwyck is superb and runs the gamut. She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Graves is a stiff leading man but Marie Prevost plays her common flat mate and steals every scene in which she appears.
- ""Rise and Shine"" was a musical on Broadway but Capra removed the songs to keep the budget down,the film being a showcase for the vaudeville comedian, Joe Cook. The story is of a circus and its survival and Cook is a likeable and funny comedian. At one point, he performs as a ""one man circus"" and his act is stunning.
- ""Miracle Woman"" is an unusual expose of preachers, based maybe on Aimee Semple McPherson. The film raises many provocative ideas but Capra himself said he ""copped out"" with the ending, too nervous that the audience would reject the premise. They did and it was a flop but it remains of interest not the least because Stanwyck stars again and is excellent.  Her leading man, playing a blind aviator, is David Manners. He was a handsome and popular leading man of the period.  Under Capra's direction, he is much better than usual and his relationship with Stanwyck is touching.
- ""Forbidden"" is a ""woman's picture"", one of a number of the period in which a woman suffered for her man, living in the ""back streets"" of his life.  The cliches are beautifully put together and Adolphe Menjou, Stanwyck and Ralph Bellamy in his film debut are excellent.
- With the ""The Bitter Tea of General Yen"", Capra really went out on a limb, exploring the role of missionaries and miscegenation.  Nils Asther, a tall Swedish actor, stars as a Chinese warlord and Stanwyck plays the missionary who struggles with her attraction to Yen. The ending is particularly memorable with Walter Connelly deserved of a best Supporting Oscar.

Two commentaries are provided - one masterful on ""Ladies of Leisure"" and one much less so by Jeanine Basinger on ""Forbidden"".  I was disappointed the same was not provided for ""General Yen"", a film so ahead of its time.  There are lots of other extras - stills, advertising, some pleasant interviews with directors such as Ron Howard and each film has an excellent essay from the TCM website. I would have preferred if they had appeared in a booklet but that may have increased the price.  Best of all, the prints are immaculate.

The appearance of a nicely packaged set, complete with commentaries and extras, is a return to the ""good old days"" instead of the often dreadful prints of the DVD ""on demand"" titles now usually issued. The price is reasonable too. Thanks TCM.",1352332800,10,3397,4.616915422885572
5274488,4,B0096ST2GU,"In 2006, Sony released the premiere ""FRANK CAPRA COLLECTION"" which contained some of his most important films of his career such as ""It Happened One Night"" and ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washinton"" among others that won him a total of three Best Director Oscars in rapid succession(1934, 1936, 1938). Only William Wyler(also with three) and John Ford(with four) can match him. Included in that set was the little seen ""American Madness""(1932), which is just as good as the others in the set but never gets mentioned. Having read Capra's autobiography ""The Name Above the Title"" when it was released in 1971, I was familiar with all his films but had little hope in ever seeing some of his early Pre-Code films(1930-1934) after watching ""American Madness"". Sony(along with TCM) has now addressed that in this new companion set: ""FRANK CAPRA: THE EARLY COLLECTION"". The five films in this new collection cover the years 1930 to 1933 and if you're a fan of Barbara Stanwyck's early work then you're in for a treat. Four of the five films feature Stanwyck in the lead and her performances are terrific. I love Stanwyck's Pre-Code films. Prior to this new release, she turns up in four films in the ""Forbidden Hollywood"" sets(Vol. 1,2,3 & 5 respectively) and in two films from the recently released ""Columbia Pre-Code Collection""(with ""TEN CENTS A DANCE"" and ""SHOPWORN""). With this new Capra release fans of Stanwyck can really see her range and development as an actress. Never a great beauty like Greta Garbo and Ingrid Bergman, Stanwyck had a natural and earthy quality to her acting that made you believe that she was really the person she was playing up there on the screen. First up in this new set is ""LADIES OF LEISURE""(1930) and this was the first picture that Stanwyck made with Capra. It's a long picture(100 mins.) and takes awhile to get going but you soon get caught up in it. Stanwyck and roommate Marie Prevost play party girls who are used as fill-in's whenever extra girls are needed for one of the many Depression Era parties the rich liked having at the time. She plays a girl similar to the one she played in ""Ten Cents a Dance"" but with almost tragic results. The real star is Marie Prevost who nearly steals the picture with her adorable performance as Stanwyck's roommate who not only has problems with her weight but alcohol as well. In a real life, Prevost actually did have this problem which untimately led to her untimely death at the age of 37. Stanwyck was among the many that attended her funeral in 1937. Next up is ""RAIN OR SHINE""(also from 1930) and although it's a circus story, it really is just a showcase for Capra to show off the talents of vaudeville star Joe Cook, who was very popular at the time. His routines of nonsensical stories may have been funny on the stage but come across flat on film. He was talented, especially in his circus routines but this picture is the weakest in the set. These first two films have an excellent picture and the restorers at Sony have done an excellent job with the sound too. Next up is ""THE MIRACLE WOMAN""(1931) with Stanwyck playing an evangelist probably based on Aimee Semple McPherson but owes more to the character in Sinclair Lewis' novel ""Elmer Gantry"". If you think that the televangelists of the 1980's(Jim & Tammy Bakker,Oral Roberts & Jimmy Swaggert) were charlatans, wait till you see how they were in 1931. Stanwyck is terrific as Sister Fallon. The next film is ""FORBIDDEN""(1932) and it has soap opera written all over it. It probably left young women crying as they left the theatre and it maybe even touched even some hardhearted men who saw it, but it failed at the box office. Stanwyck ages about thirty years in this one and once again she's outstanding. So is Adolphe Menjou who plays her lover. A very young Ralph Bellamy is also one of her suitors. These last two pictures are not as crystal clear, video-wise, as the first two but were probably restored from the best available sources. That being said, the final film in this set boasts an excellent video picture and sound and is the most controversal of the five films. ""THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN""(1933) is set war-torn Shanghai and involves an interracial romance between a white missionary and her Chinese captor. Watching this film, you could see how not only Capra was developing as a director, but where Stanwyck was also headed. This was one of the biggest and costly films that Columbia had made at that time and the sets and visuals(by cinematographer Joseph Walker) are stunning. Unfortunately, because of it's controversal subject matter at the time, the picture failed at the box office and was pulled from release. That's a shame, because it's a great film and needs to be re-discovered. Those are the five films in this new set and if you already own the first Frank Capra Collection then this is a welcome companion set. Hopefully SONY & TCM will release a Vol. 2 of ""The Early Collection"" with ""Flight""(1929), ""Dirigible""(1931), ""Platinum Blonde""(1931), ""Lady For A Day""(1933) and ""Broadway Bill""(1934)for Frank Capra fans in the future.",1351814400,27,5100,4.770361990950226
8536991,2,B0096ST2GU,OK the problem I have with this is you pay a lot of money for DVD-Rs..... what's with that? For the price couldn't they afford manufactured DVDs... NO! Petty and gouging.  So nothing to do with the content just the cheap media... that doesn't last. Shame on you TCM!,1529539200,,266,4.428571428571429
8536992,1,B0096ST2GU,"Amazon is impeccable!
Shipping and service on the level.
Films worthy, but at such a price could be and subtitles!
Given the prescription of these films, subtitles in english, at least, that necessity!",1501372800,,201,5.121212121212121
8536993,5,B0096ST2GU,"Watching this collection now.  Started with ""The Miracle Woman"". Made in 1931 it remains riveting and enthralling.  Still extremely edgy even by today's standards.  It is touching, shocking and funny. (Spoiler alert, sort of-- I don't think it will quite ruin the moment for you but you have to see it):  One of the funniest moments (perhaps in screen history) is when the ventriloquist's dummy orders Barbara Stanwyck to say ""truly rural"".  With her soft Brooklyn "" R "" Stanwyck can just barely do it.  A funny, subtle touch which obviously was Capra's idea.  What a wonderful, engaging and absorbing film.  1931 and it still grabs you.  Can't wait to watch the entire collection but ""The Miracle Woman"" alone is worth it.",1500249600,,723,4.860655737704918
8536994,5,B0096ST2GU,Wow... These movies are solid. They pull the heart strings and reveal the truth about humanity. I thought I loved Stanwyck's work before I saw these. Now I'm convinced she is in the top 5 greatest actresses ever. Solid performance drama is difficult to pull off and under Capras direction she nails it. Capra is my favorite director from this era. Solid contribution all around.,1473897600,,378,4.8307692307692305
8536995,5,B0096ST2GU,This collection of early Frank Capra features is a must for anyone wanting to understand the rise of Capra from filmmaker to film artist. Four of the films showcase Barbara Stanwyck in the films that quickly made her a star. The transfers are beautiful and the included notes on the discs are interesting. Some of the films were released in both sound and silent versions. In the case of RAIN OR SHINE you will have the opportunity to view both versions. This collection will best be served with a reading of FRANK CAPRA: THE NAME ABOVE THE TITLE and/or with FRANK CAPRA: THE CATASTROPHE OF SUCCESS by Joseph McBride. A couple of the titles have commentary tracks and a few have supplemental materials included. So if you are seriously interested in the films of Frank Capra or of Barbara Stanwyck then this set is a must.,1430956800,,822,4.636986301369863
8536996,5,B0096ST2GU,The 4 Stanwyck films are exceptional.  Capra recognized her ability and strengths early on.  Great collection.,1424131200,,110,5.8125
8536997,5,B0096ST2GU,"An excellent collection of very hard to find films. Barbara Stanwyck shines in Ladies of Leisure, Forbidden, Miracle Woman and The Bitter Tea of General Yen. I feel that her pre-code work is some of her best. I was very excited to add this DVD box set to my dvd collection.",1423612800,,273,4.372549019607843
8536998,5,B0096ST2GU,My wife and I enjoy watching the old movies as some are classic and some are hilariously out of date or acted so differently they are very enjoyable. We love the collection.,1391040000,,173,4.4375
8536999,5,B0096ST2GU,"I enjoy the pre-code era of films the best of all so I was anxious to watch the offerings in this early collection from Frank Capra.
My favorites were Ladies of Leisure and The Miracle Woman. Ladies of Leisure stars a very young Barbara Stanwyck playing a party girl who hitchhikes a ride home from a wild party one night with a straight laced (and wealthy) young artist (played by Ralph Graves).
Barbara lives with Marie Prevost and there are some great scenes and lines exchanged between  Prevost and Lowell Sherman.
Sherman plays the perpetual drunk (comic relief) but the film concentrates mainly on the love affair that develops between Barbara and Ralph Grave's characters.  Ralph Grave's mother tries to break up their amour but love will triumph in the somewhat surprising
end to this film.
I think I actually liked the Miracle Woman the best of all the films in this set.
Stanwyk's father dies suddenly just before his sermon to the congregation and here we see a young Stanwyck full of emotion and
standing up to the men of the church who took him for granted.  A travelling no good scam artist happens to be watching the
heated verbal exchanges between Stanwyck and the church members from the back of the church and he convinces her to come with him and he will transform her into a world famous evangelist.
This is exactly what happens to her but she never has any fun or time to enjoy herself without this Scam Bum around her with a big cigar hanging out of his mouth.
Then one night when Stanwyck goes out on the stage, instead of the regular ""actors and actresses that fake their ailments and claim to be miraculously cured, up jumps a young man who has been blinded in World War 1 (David Manners). He gets into the lion cage with her and after the show he invites her into his apartment.
She is smitten with his charming, but innocent good looks and humble appeal.
He also is entertaining (an amateur ventriloquist) and she starts going back to visit him and falls in love with him.
I'm not going to give away what happens in the end.
You will enjoy this film. I watch it over and over again.",1378425600,,2109,4.515706806282722

  I can't say enough good things about this Capra collection.  This product is in excellent condition and I'm enjoying every minute of it.
