2543999,5,B000EXDRVM,"I purchased as a Christmas gift and wasn't able to pry him away from his recliner and big screen until he'd seen it all. I have just started watching it and am enjoying it also. Definitely not for children to see though! He would say ""awesome"".",1168300800,2,244,4.326086956521739
2544000,5,B000EXDRVM,"Excellent depiction of life in 1870 Deadwood.  This was truly the Wild, Wild West.  Very well done!  I highly recommend for those of you adults with an interest in the old American west.",1162598400,5,186,4.575757575757576
2544001,5,B000EXDRVM,"What can I say? If you know anything about this HBO series you know that the language and images are completely realistic - meaning they are a raw and unflinching depiction of the actual town of Deadwood, a gold mining town with no law and order except the justice that residents imposed on themselves - which was very little.  The acting, writing, and production values are superb.  If you like REALISTIC drama and yearn to ""experience"" the ""old west"" then Deadwood is for you.  If you prefer sanitized drama then you will probably not care for this series.  Deadwood Seasons 1 & 2 are 2/3 of the entire series.  Deadwood Season Three - which completed filming not long ago - will be available soon.  If you enjoy seasons I & II you will be definitely waiting anxiously for Season III, as I am.",1162425600,3,795,4.524475524475524
2544002,5,B000EXDRVM,This dramatic western has not only every single episode to enjoy but as well it comes with background information; historic information and it's an awesome never to be seen again set of the most exciting time in history.  It's awesome!!!,1156032000,2,237,4.925
2544003,5,B000EXDRVM,This is an excellent show!  I can't wait until the next season comes out.  Item arrived in excellent condition in a reasonable amount of time.,1156032000,,142,4.64
2544004,5,B000EXDRVM,"Having seen several of the episodes of DEADWOOD previously, I pretty much knew what to expect - and I was not disappointed at all.  The story lines and character development are pure fun to watch.  I went through the two seasons in about a week.  It makes me anxious to get Season 3.",1155859200,2,283,4.30188679245283
2544005,5,B000EXDRVM,"Deadwood is based on the wild west and some of the characters and events are based on factual history. The language and the actions of this camp were acceptable for that time and certain members. I love watching this show, its realistic of the era. I don't understand why someone would waste their time to write a negative review of something they obviously have not watched, but to each their own. I don't live my life like this obviously, but it doesnt mean I don't enjoy the show.",1154736000,2,483,4.5
2544006,5,B000EXDRVM,"Here in Oregon, we have a reputable Shakespeare company in Ashland, and my wife and I make annual pilgrimages to see the latest productions.

I mention this autobiographical trivia because I couldn't put my finger on why DEADWOOD seemed so familiar to me. It was not because I've seen westerns before, because DEADWOOD is profoundly different from any western that's ever been made.

And then I realized it: This is the equivalent of modern-day Shakespeare.

Lest the good reader think I am overreaching, let's review DEADWOOD's merits: Layered storylines, exemplary casting and acting, pathos and comedy, gritty realism... but most importantly, the language, my God, the LANGUAGE!

Much has been made of DEADWOOD's incredibly salty lingo, but I think discourses on the show's profanity unfairly overshadow the fact that the lines these characters deliver are pure gold. In Deadwood, conversations are masterful displays of timing and wit, and even lowly characters like Farnum get delicious speeches that plumb their souls, please our ears, and stir us if we are willing to listen. Just like the Bard wrote!",1149292800,35,1108,5.242937853107344
2544007,5,B000EXDRVM,"If you like westerns, but always thought they were a bit too 'polished', lacking the truth behind what life must have been like, then this is for you! Simply the best dramatic representation of an old west boomtown I've ever seen. The series includes historical figures such as Calamity Jane, and Wild Bill Hickok, as well as some lesser know real-life contemporaries. The sets are chronologically accurate down to the last detail. Even the language spoken is an accurate portrayal of how english must have been spoken at the time. Again, if you like westerns, you'll LOVE this!",1142812800,18,578,4.908163265306122
8115476,5,B000EXDRVM,"The language is like Shakespeare...it's poetic and takes a bit to get your ear trained, but what fun you'll have!
One of the best series EVER!",1408665600,,142,4.5
8115477,5,B000EXDRVM,"""Deadwood"" is a series we watch entirely every year. Great Cast; well-researched and well-written story line. We only regret that they did not continue with a Season four and beyond!",1384819200,,182,5.1
8115478,4,B000EXDRVM,"I don't want to return the item because I have watched most of the DVDs and that would feel wrong but did want to make everyone aware that the Disc 3 on Season 1 will not play the 2nd of 3 episodes.  This is very upsetting because I like doing business with Amazon. Also, the box that Season one came in is all busted up.  Didn't effect the set.",1343001600,,345,3.9855072463768115
8115479,5,B000EXDRVM,"I purchases these DVD sets because I loved the series and wanted to be able to watch them whenever I wanted.  Still waiting for the ""finale"" movies.",1231804800,,148,4.481481481481482
8115480,5,B000EXDRVM,This is the greatest show and the greatest characters ever written - David Milch is completely brilliant.  Fans of the HBO series will love the DVD collection - the bonus features are fantastic.  People that aren't familiar with the series should buy all 3 seasons and dive in!,1214179200,,277,4.75
8115481,5,B000EXDRVM,A great series once you get used to the language of that era. The bonus by the writer is just essential to watch before you start watching the series to understand just how real this all has been ....I loved it.,1188432000,,211,4.170731707317073
8115482,5,B000EXDRVM,"Raw, randy, and real.  Great production and true depiction of the period.  Not recommended for the easily offended.  Pulls no punches.  Great historical drama.  Once again HBO productions far outshines the competition.",1180483200,2,218,5.6875
8115483,5,B000EXDRVM,"Makes the ""Wild, Wild, Wild West"" look kinda Sissy-fied.  Comes complete with those rare moments you would want to repeat at work except that you are smart enough to realize: 1) They probably wouldn't get the reference & 2) You'ld be dragged into Human Resources so fast your head would spin around and you'ld puke green-pea-soup all over your supervisor.",1175817600,3,355,4.916666666666667
8115484,5,B000EXDRVM,"The product was a Christmas gift, however it was the wrong gift and I returned it and re-ordered the correct gift.  I was very pleased with the Amazon ordering process.",1169078400,,168,4.6
8115485,5,B000EXDRVM,"Got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. Not only did it arrive on time, but it made my boyfriend very happy. The quality of the DVD's were excellent. After viewing the DVD's my boyfriend shared them with his best friend. My boyfriend was very happy, which made me happy. Thank you",1168560000,,281,4.529411764705882
