8550038,5,B00AD6IF4O,"I have bought several of the Bike-O-Visions videos and use them for my exercise bike. We visited Yosemite National Park last year and I got this tape to revisit the beautiful sites. the videos are always well done. Next I think I'll bike the Tetons!! They do seem to travel around faster than a bike would, but I still enjoy the ride.",1465084800,,334,4.403225806451613
8550039,5,B00AD6IF4O,"Neat concept here with three strikingly different areas on one disc!  I use these videos every day, regardless of the season, and they have me fit as a fiddle.  I won't reveal my age- sorry, but my doctor is now telling me I have the vital signs and muscle tone of someone at least 20 years younger (I guess that makes me at least 20! ha ha).
  Dont get me wrong, I love Yosemite, but if the first part of this has too much up-and-down and curvy roads for you, you can always just skip a few chapters ahead to the long flat serenity of Death Valley, which looks like something straight out of a western movie.  And speaking of westerns, I know Ive seen some of the rock formations in in the Alabama Hills in some old movies, cant say exactly which ones, but like that ending chapter nevertheless.  Very interesting and recommended!",1412035200,,831,4.363636363636363
