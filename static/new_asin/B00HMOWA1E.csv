6184115,2,B00HMOWA1E,"What was meant as a warm, milk and cookies, ""feel good""  movie with an ever so light rap on the career knuckles about loving what you do and doing what you love, comes across as an exercise in Moviemaking 101, with maybe a grade of C?  The conflict: self vs self,  family propagated ambitious career vs being myself and, building tree houses....FREE.  (Protagonist's first name is Freemont...ewww...how destiny tips us, huh?  The selfish director laid the music on top of scenes without so much as a thought that the lyrics in the song might intrude on viewer's intelligible hearing of character dialogue.  And with such a vast world musical library to choose from, he goes with unprofessional, self-written (and hummed and strummed on the guitar?) numbers.  Music also doesn't match the scene mood, so ironically creates disharmony where harmony was needed.  The acting was plain jane as I got caught up in the trim job of his beard, and the love interest's harsh voice.  Scene cuts, interfacing were rough, poorly timed, and editing just didn't create the seamless united effect of a single, artistic work.  Within the first 8 minutes of the film, which is supposed to ""hook"" the audience, the quick cuts and lesser characters' purpose was an amalgam of contrary images.  There was consistency once he was given a new Chevy and drove east from California to find....a biopic of the parents good deeds!  So why wasn't this film just turned into a biography because it doesn't have a single unifying purpose through its didactic chowder.  No.",1395964800,4,1542,4.9073359073359075

6184117,5,B00HMOWA1E,"Gordon Family Tree is poignant, uplifting, and wholesome. I was fortunate enough to attend the premiere in Fayetteville, AR, but was unprepared to be so moved. With a cast comprised of old favorites like Richard Karn, and many new faces from Northwest Arkansas's burgeoning film scene, this heartwarming tale of personal discovery delivers the goods. In an age where films are full of CGI, violence, foul language, and moral depravity, it was refreshing to see a movie that gets back to the root of storytelling without the cheap trappings of modern Hollywood. Appropriate for most ages.",1391385600,9,587,5.125

Think about it.  Aren't you getting sick of the same old kinds of movies from Hollywood?  The same plots, over and over again?  How many sequels can you watch?  Why not try some indie movies instead?

6184143,2,B00HMOWA1E,"Amazon reviewers, please don't do this to me again. My wife and I lasted about 30 minutes. First and foremost what ruined this movie for us was the sound editing. Not only was the sound ""off"" for this movie (music too loud, character voices tone and volume levels were all different), but the editing person felt the need to play the same piano riffs through EVERY scene. Hint to sound editor: you don't need to play music for the entire movie. It also didn't need to take the first 30 minutes to tell the part of the story about him not being happy in his job. Slooooow. No chemistry at with the girl to this point in the movie. Sorry if this comes off mean, but it drove me crazy.",1425254400,,682,4.253846153846154

6184156,1,B00HMOWA1E,Sorry. We looked forward to this movie as it sounded like an interesting plot. The story just never held our interest. Many of the technical details seemed poorly done. The sound levels varied so much we never knew where to set the volume. Most of the on-screen notes we were supposed to read were there and gone too quickly for us to make sense.

6184220,3,B00HMOWA1E,"Did he ever find his wallet?

Okay, I confess, I skipped about 10 minutes around the time the guy from Home Improvement had his lines. But that was the only tension in the movie, I kept thinking, how does he drive around without getting stopped by the police. I wouldn't make it around the block. If anyone watched the whole thing, I'd really like to know. I mean, he was all around the country, so we find out after she covered his story. ""What? You don't know who he is?"" (I'll conveniently leave my camera where you can find it). What a guy. He wasn't going to tell her. So anyway, he covered a lot of miles without his wallet I'm thinking. I kept waiting and looking at the time of the movie for the bad thing to happen near the last 15-20 minutes... you know, the low point where people stop smiling. (I was thinking like he was going to hit his thumb with the hammer and say a bad word or get sued by some family for not putting rails on the steps of the tree houses)... and then it happened... when I saw his brother's car I was so hopeful... thinking his brother died... but no, he hurt his leg that ended his career... lucky thing because then he was available to go in partnership with his brother. Which brings me to another thing that bothers me... my sister never gave ME a car. I haven't called her up to ask why since I am so mad at her right now because she never did anything like that for me... ever.  The only satisfaction I got was that it was only a Chevy. Looked like a rental. Maybe it was only a lease. Yeah. It was probably only a lease. A used Chevy lease. I feel better.  Maybe I'll call my sister now. You never know, with Christmas and my birthday coming and if I'm nice to her... you never know. I'm not going to ask. I'm just going to drop subtle hints. Tell her how much I like the new C class Mercedes. Sounds like a plan. You know, one thing I'll probably never get over is that my family, co-workers, and friends never were as nice to me as in this movie. I felt a little uncomfortable because I thought the one guy was going to kiss him at his birthday party. I guess that was another part of the movie that had a little tension. Another thing. I never fell in love that fast or had so many cute moments. But let me stop talking about the other guy and move on to his female love interest. She sure made a lot of funny faces on his I Phone. Seemed a little over confident and pushy to me, you know, for a balloon lady. But then she really was a writer. If you are writing... as an investigative reporter, you should really check out who you are writing about. Someone would have had a picture or described him as a smiley guy with a beard who forgets where he leaves things and who had a Chevy. Most people have Japanese or Korean cars now. I think a Honda Civic would have worked better. The Chevy would have been a dead giveaway.  I'll tell you, I was really surprised he fell in love by the time he got to the second floor. I work in a building with 4 floors. Nada. Of course my wife works in the same building as I do, so I'm not looking to fall in love. Hey! What was up with that song about a guy coming home from Vietnam? Did I miss what that was all about? It's possible. Stuff happened so fast in the movie. I took my eyes off the couple for just a few seconds and she was pregnant. Did you see how pregnant she was? Man, that looked uncomfortable. I kept thinking the kid was like lying down with his hands behind his head like he was on a hammock or something. I wonder if they'll sell the Airstream Trailer. She seems like the type that will demand a big house. It'll never last. I was surprised the door of the Airstream didn't close too well. They're supposed to be pretty good quality. I saw how they make them on ""How It's Made"". Now that was an exciting 30 minutes. Not much tension either. Something's really bothering me. How does this guy build tree houses in people's yards working till late at night without the neighbors complaining. Did all the families go away like the first one he built? I noticed his circular saw had a cord. The drill was battery driven... okay I get that. But he had to cut the wood. I don't have outlets by the trees in my yard. And furthermore, you need a permit and approval from the HOA to build stuff like that. Um... where was he getting the money to buy all that wood? Don't you have to have a wallet and a Home Depot or Lowes credit card and some ID to buy the materials? That must have happened during the 10 minutes I missed. Probably the ""Home Improvement"" guy had all that stuff. That makes sense. They get stuff for free just by endorsing products. Speaking of products. Did you notice that the water cooler said Culligan on it? Hey Culligan man! Remember that ad? I kept saying that over and over again to myself while chuckling. I actually said it out loud and my daughter asked me what I why I was talking to myself. She also asked what I was watching because some of the music she thought was weird. Oh yeah... some of the actors in the diner and the jobsite sounded like they weren't actors. I was wondering if they were really good actors who were trying to sound like non-actors trying to sound like actors. If so, they did a fantastic job. Did anyone else think the guy in the park was going to hit him or maybe shoot him for playing with his kids? I think he was a little too trusting. I would have asked to see ID. When he couldn't produce a wallet, it's 9-1-1 time. I wouldn't buy off on the line about the wallet being in his car. But then there was a lot I didn't buy off on in the movie.  Nice family movie though.",1414800000,,5624,4.155963302752293

6184232,5,B00HMOWA1E,"At first this movie seemed a bit slow, there were no known actors in it, no high-speed effects found in big-name movies, so hold tight until the main actor begins his journey.

This was definitely a slower movie that I'd normally watch, and luckily I didn't turn it off right away.

After finishing it, I found it to be very heart-warming and inspirational.

This is definitely a family-friendly movie and great to teach kids about doing self-less acts.",1414713600,,453,4.782051282051282

There are no explosions, no big laugh out loud moments, no harrowing drama and no big tear jerk. It was a well written,  beautifully filmed, superbly acted, sweet movie.

This movie will have you reflecting on many aspects of your life but does so without hammering a big message into your head.",1414281600,,414,4.227848101265823
6184237,5,B00HMOWA1E,"This movie, for one reason or another, took me three evenings to finish. The acting was very good, the cinematography was VERY good and the storyline was inspiring. I did take issue with the choices made for the soundtrack, however. At one point I was ready to discontinue watching because of the mind-numbing music sequences but it got better after ""But for the Grace of God,"" or whatever it was called. But why on earth was the mournful cello piece chosen for an underscore when the nurse was taking Free through the house-under-construction to meet her father. I was worried they were going to find him dead! But ... I loved the movie and I will keep an eye out for other works by Ryan Schwartzman.",1413763200,,701,4.571428571428571

Maybe it is, don't know because after about a half hour of wondering when the plot was going to take off, my wife asked why I picked this movie. I said the reviews seem to be high for it. For me, is it too much to ask that the picture be bright enough to see detail, at least in the outdoor, bright sunlight scenes? Video was dark like they couldn't afford lighting and while the background music was pleasant, the movie just didn't hold our interest. Didn't finish it.",1408752000,,503,4.25

6184277,4,B00HMOWA1E,"Gordon Family Tree is a warm-hearted story about a single man who comes from the Gordon family, where each member is a person of influence or celebrity; whereas he is working in an architectural firm instead of following his dream. Follow Freemont Gordon as he travels far from home leaving his own mark on lives he touches while interaction with others restores his belief in himself. This film may feel slow at times, but it's paced that way intentionally so that you can feel what Freemont feels and experience his awakening in the same way he does. I highly recommend this film!!!! Totally appropriate for the whole family. We need more wholesome films like this.",1398816000,11,667,4.808695652173913

It's a feel-good, inspirational movie and a nice change from the Hollywood violence.  Thank you for making it.",1398470400,12,400,4.1558441558441555
6184279,5,B00HMOWA1E,This is a beautiful departure from the typical story of 20-30 something's crashing weddings - screwing up one another's lives.  It allows us to see what life reveals when Freemont Gordon works his way across the country.  The characters are real - the music is fun - the discoveries are thoughtful without being predictable.  Lightly humorous and intelligent. Sit down with your family or a couple of friends and enjoy this man's story.,1396224000,11,436,4.945205479452055

mediocre writing
mediocre acting
Bad directing and horrible editing
