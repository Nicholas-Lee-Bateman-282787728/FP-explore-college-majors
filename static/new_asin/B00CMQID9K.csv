5730525,5,B00CMQID9K,"I cannot give this any rating less than 5 stars.  I watched one episode the other day, prompting Amazon to ask me for my opinion.  My older 2 children were born in 1995 & 1997.  We faithfully watched The Big Comfy Couch and my children even had a replica of the couch that they sat on for TV watching.  We also had a Lunette doll and a Molly doll.  My girls LOVED this show.  Fast forward to this weekend, and my younger two children (born in 2006 & 2008) were looking for something different to watch and I stumbled across this.  Although it may not be as great as it seemed almost 20 years, I was happy to show off to all of my children that I still knew all the words to the opening song!  Although I may have been more impressed with myself than any of them were.  Still good for a nostalgic watch, although modern children expect too much in the way of animation to thoroughly enjoy.  It was great seeing Major Bedhead again also!",1474243200,,935,4.202247191011236

As a parent, there's some nice communication education involved. Good morals encouraged.

There are predictable moments (activities and phrases that are used every show) that provide the children with an assurance of regularity (such as daily stretching and cleaning up after play time) -- I love this part, too!  The episodes teach new vocabulary words, some not even commonly used these days, which serves to stretch the child's ability to understand the use of different words with the same meaning.  We LOVE this show.",1406073600,4,606,4.532110091743119

Its shows like these that help a sick child's day go a little bit better :)",1402358400,2,383,4.333333333333333
5730667,5,B00CMQID9K,"This show started in 1992 in Canada and was picked up by public broadcasting in the United States in 1995. My daughter was born in 1994 and I started watching with her when she was a little over one year old. Because there were only 13 episodes a season and the show was stripped five days a week, we ran through the 52 episodes of the series in about three months.  I remember how excited we were when we got the 13 new 1996 episodes. By that time we had already seen every previous episode four or five times.  I think we watched each of the original 65 episodes at least twenty times until my daughter was about four years and started pre-school. It was the only children's television show that I, as an adult, found as funny and charming as my daughter did.

My daughter is now 20 and gave birth to a baby girl, four months ago. We found the original episodes online and started watching them with the baby. The amazing thing was that the baby actually reacted to the clock rug stretch and started to move her arms and legs, trying to imitate Loonette's movements. We are both looking forward to watching the show again with the new baby. I can't wait to see the 26 additional episodes that were made. I hope the new Loonette is as great as Alyson Court was.",1402185600,5,1262,4.3164556962025316

5730669,4,B00CMQID9K,"Simple and fun.  Good lessons.
No snarky insult humor. Wish they'd make some more.  It went off the air in late '90's I think. This show is it's own case for supporting public television.",1401840000,,187,4.470588235294118

8583538,2,B00CMQID9K,"Buyer Beware:

This is a really cool ""old school"" kids show that is not over the top theatrics and keeping things simple for kids to be entertained.  The only problem is the DVD itself.  The show I do believe was produced in Canada and it appears these DVD's are formatted that way.  The DVD works enough to watch a few episodes but then it just stops.  If your DVD player doesn't have multi formatting functions then watching this DVD probably won't happen.  Check your DVD player first before buying.  For the record, I bought a brand new updated DVD player that should have played the entire DVD but it didn't.  It didn't play the second disk.",1503014400,,646,4.508620689655173
