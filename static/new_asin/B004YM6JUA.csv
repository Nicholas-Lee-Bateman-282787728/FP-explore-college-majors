The only reason why I am still watching it is ... I am waiting for the episode where Nancy ""receives her due diligent justice""!",1327190400,11,261,4.574468085106383
4500815,5,B004YM6JUA,"I am an avid Weeds fan, I've followed the show since season 1, and season 7 proves yet again why Weeds is such a smash hit. The characters find themselves in a new setting with a new list of wildly fun guest stars. Each of the main cast goes under some form of change whether it be mentally or physically. The writing is just as snappy and the characters, well developed. Season 7 bought back Heylia James and all the comic relief that comes with her. I am most anxious for season 8, and do hope they bring back Celia Hodes.",1325376000,11,524,4.198019801980198
4500816,5,B004YM6JUA,I look foward to waiting on the mail for my  Netflix to come....the reason being I know Nancy Botwin would be entertaining my entire evening and I would not have to have one thought of my own dramatic life for the rest of the day :D This is the ronchiest sitcom and for some reason I can't seem to peel myself from the screen!!

4500817,1,B004YM6JUA,"Definitely the worst season of Weeds, by far. Things started getting ridiculous Season 4 or so, and the show should've definitely been cancelled by now. Nancy was likeable in the first several seasons, and little by little I've gotten to not be able to stand her. Irritating, not funny, and boring, season 7 sucked.",1323734400,25,315,4.851851851851852

4500819,5,B004YM6JUA,"Just keeps getting better and better. My favorite of all the seasons, season 7 has been such a fun journey to take. The writers and actors just keep topping themselves. God I hope they renew their contracts and keep giving us more fun and trouble for Nancy and the gang to get into. I know it probably won't happen. And I'm cool with the ending. But c'mon! give us more!",1321142400,4,370,4.3
4500820,5,B004YM6JUA,"Last season showed our favorite antiheroine, Nancy Botwin, giving herself up to authorities, taking the rap for the murder of Pilar, which was actually committed by her son Shane. The murderer, as well as Andy and Silas were headed to Copenhagen, Denmark, to start a new life. Some were saying that could have been a great ending for the entire series, which may as well have ended at the end of season three.

In all conceivable rationality, Weeds should have ended when they left Agrestic, because it became an entirely different series after this happened, but I have enjoyed every season they have done thoroughly. I think the series has thrived on change, and it proves in a fun way that people don't change, even with change constantly happening around them.

In season seven, we pick up on Nancy and the Botwin clan three years later. By this time, Nancy has done three years behind bars, for ""manslaughter"", with her drug-dealing history seemingly ignored. In the first ten minutes of this season's premiere, with an anonymous deal from someone whose identity we never find, she is released from prison and sent to a halfway house in Manhattan, where she stays for about half of this season. Three years behind bars have seemingly done nothing to her emotionally, because she goes right back into dealing, and as the show's history has proven, trouble will follow her.

Mary Louise-Parker (Nancy) enjoys a season full of exciting story-lines, and chances to make her character more interesting. However, the rest of the cast is given semi-lame story-lines this year. Andy, Silas and Shane come back from Copenhagen, and buy a loft in New York, hoping to leave a place for Nancy to return to, after being released from the halfway house.

Silas (Hunter Parrish) has been doing male modeling in Copenhagen (which is appropriate, given how hot he's become), and he's still mad at Nancy after finding out that Judah was not his biological father. His bitchy little antics last through most of the season, and it's simply annoying for the most part. Shane (Alexander Gould) is grateful for Nancy's sacrifices for him. He's been doing marionettes puppet theater in Copenhagen for the past three years, and this season, Nancy gives him the ultimatum, ""I gave you three years, you're going to give me four"", and sends him to college.

Doug (Kevin Nealon) is useless this season, as he was last year. He's still funny, but not in the same way he used to be. He's become a parody of himself, starting with last season, however, he's given a semi-decent story-line this year, which comes pretty close to redeeming his character, however, I still think he should've been given the boot when Celia was left out of the picture.

Truly, this is one of the best seasons Weeds has done in a while, the best we've seen since maybe season four. It ends up being something completely different than it began. The ending was a cliff-hanger that truly bothers me, considering this may be the final season, given that it hasn't been decided yet whether there will be a season eight. I truly hope that there will be a season eight, considering that the way they ended this year is completely horrible. That season has the possibility to be better than this one.",1320278400,12,3245,4.796064400715563
4500821,5,B004YM6JUA,"Season 7 brings the fun back to Weeds. The tone of this season is much closer to that of the first three seasons, which I think fans will appreciate.

This season sees the Botwin clan relocated to New York City after Nancy is released from a 3 year prison stint. It's safe to say that the recurring theme of ""no one ever changes, ever"" is present and thriving, since Nancy picks right back off where she left off. At this point in the show, her actions are not necessarily surprising, but still insanely compelling. We have been with Nancy for 7 years now, so we know her well, just like her family we easily accept her descent back into crime. There are some differences of course, with Nancy having the smarts to reestablish her own team and openly fight for the things she believes in (instead of keeping them to herself). At least she seems to be learning, at least a little, from her past mistakes. The goddess Mary-Louise Parker still never hits a false note here. Mary-Louise always finds the comedy in Nancy's decisions and there is plenty of first rate wit coming from the actress in this season. After all, she is the reason we keep coming back to Weeds, and let me tell you, her performance this season does not disappoint! The season is best when Nancy is pitted against her nasty sister Jill (recurring guest star Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is perfection here, especially in the finale).

Andy (Justin Kirk) gets the least amount to do this season, unfortunately. His story is reduced to a fling with an artist in an open marriage (Lindsay Sloane) and the occasional comic relief. Silas (a very reliable Hunter Parrish) gets the most to do, besides Nancy, this season. He sets up his own team of dealers and eventually competes against Nancy. This is the most dramatic storyline of the latter part of the season and plays out naturally and emotionally. Parker and Parrish have some fantastic scenes together. Shane (Alexander Gould) enrolls in college and gets an, ironic, internship with the NYPD for Det. Mitch Ouellette (Michael Harney). This aspect of the season works because it's ambiguous, which adds an air of mystery. Even after the finale were never sure what is going to come of this, but it's certainly leading to something big. Doug (Kevin Nealon) has relevance once again, after an aimless storyline in season 6. He gets a job on Wall Street with some old buddies and it intertwines nicely with Nancy's wheelings and dealings.

With a fresh setting and a brisk pace, season 7 of Weeds brings the show back to it's roots. We get plenty of nasty humor, plenty of danger and plenty of guest stars (Martin Short, Olga Sosnovska, Pablo Schreiber, Aidan Quinn, Michelle Trachtenberg) and returning favorites (Tonye Patano, Andy Milder). If you have loved Weeds so far, season 7 will not disappoint, especially with yet another stellar Jenji Kohan-certified cliffhanger, this is a very memorable season. It may be uneven, the series has a few storytelling kinks to work out in the beginning half of the season by trying to reconnect all the Botwins, but in the end it works and opens plenty of new storytelling avenues.

For Weeds fans, season 7 comes highly recommended.

4500822,4,B004YM6JUA,"The season started out strong and with a lot of potential. Unfortunately the pacing of this season was very slow then too fast. As a whole it had a lot of interesting dynamics. Nancy meets a mini-version of herself as a rival, rivals her sister to get back her baby, hs a new partnership funded by Shane as he uses his manipulation for expanding the family drug business and a billion other Botwin-filled antics only this show can deliver.

There are 13 episodes in this season. I will try to mantain as spoiler-free as possible since some people aren't up to speed.

13. Do Her/Don't Do Her
Grade: B

In a ho-hum finale, everything is resolved and then paved off with a Season 3 like cliffhanger. The series may and hopefully will return so we can get a better resulotion for the Botwin clan.

This season had it's ups and downs. It was not as over the top as Season 5, but like season 6 seemed to lack a general direction and central plot. Each episode was writte well, things just didn't play out like they used to, it was somewhat sloppy. Still, overall it was an enjoyable season. B+

4501188,5,B004YM6JUA,"I enjoyed Weeds seasons 7 & 8 and that's why I bought them.  But I have had some negative experiences with a product I bought on Amazon.  I rated it fairly and accurately.  I didn't use course language and my description of the product was absolutely true.  Amazon took down the post and told me that it violated the terms of service agreement at which point it gave me a link that did NOT go to said terms of service agreement.  They ask that I rewrite the review which I did, but again, because it was honest and warned people not to buy the shoddy piece of crap that I was sold (in much nicer terms, mind you, in fact, all I said was that I didn't recommend buying it.) Again it was taken down. I sent an email to Amazon which was completely ignored.  So buy Weeds with confidence, if you liked the series you will be pleased with this product.  But don't expect to get a balanced review of Amazon products or sellers because they delete those reviews.",1401148800,2,955,4.272222222222222

4501192,5,B004YM6JUA,"This was a very interesting season for Nancy and her family. This season showed very different character changes, from Nancy trying to live in a half/way house and still sale weed, to the new characters introduced during the season. Also, Doug changed during this season into a strong financial backer for Nancy and not just for comedic relief, but a major force in the series.",1394928000,,377,4.815384615384615

4501231,4,B004YM6JUA,"Good way to wind down a series. This season still has enough going for it,whereas Season 8 faded like the sun going down.

4501240,4,B004YM6JUA,"Season 8 doesn't quite match season 7, but it is still a fitting conclusion to the series.  It feels like season 8 doesn't have as much compelling drama, especially in the first few episodes.",1379721600,,191,4.617647058823529
4501241,4,B004YM6JUA,This season was good but I didn't like the fact that Nancy ended up in jail for three years and didn't get to see little Stevie grow up... I was looking forward to seeing him grow with the show too.,1379289600,,198,3.975

4501252,5,B004YM6JUA,Big fan of  Ms Parker ever since I saw her in West Wing. The whole series never disappoints. All the characters persona's were stretch as far as they could go and then were still added onto by the great acting of all the stars. highly recommend for the mature folks who can understand good intelligent humor and never take life too seriously.,1372636800,,342,4.516129032258065

Third order from Amazon this week which I have had to deal with because third party distributer does not know the laws of distribution.  Going to keep this one because I need it now but the law says for distribution in Canada only. The description says US and Canada but itme does not.,1371254400,,453,4.305882352941176

4501259,5,B004YM6JUA,"With very few low points the entire run of Weeds was funny, clever, irreverent and the final season did the whole run justice. If you haven't watched Weeds I most strongly suggest that you start with season 1. The arc and development of all the characters is one of the things that made this such a wonderful show.  Buy the first Season and my guess is you'll be hooked.",1369180800,,370,4.36231884057971
4501260,2,B004YM6JUA,This season seems like a bunch of shows put together to bring the series to an end.  Watched 3 episodes and haven't been back since.  Was a big fan but not into wasting my time with this season.,1369180800,,194,4.078947368421052
4501261,5,B004YM6JUA,This is a great show...addictive!  I cant wait to see what Season 8 has in store.  Watching these unedited is the only way to go.  We were first introduced to the series on TV...edited.,1368835200,,185,4.382352941176471

4501290,5,B004YM6JUA,"I've loved and watched this show since it started in 2005. While I've noticed the later seasons get a little crazier and a little more unrealistic, I guess that's just part of the charm.",1363219200,,186,4.5

4501293,2,B004YM6JUA,"This was the season of Weeds that I enjoyed the least. I often got bored while watching and wished they would have just ended it at season 6. When season 7 ended, I wanted it to stop there (though I was pleasantly surprised with season 8).

I own seasons 1-6 and I own season 8 but I can't see any point in buying season 7 other than to complete my collection. It's filled with episodes that I wouldn't want to ever watch again. Nancy is also highly irritating in this season. Her behavior can no longer be blamed on wanting to protect her kids. We see her for what she is.",1362528000,2,573,4.162162162162162

4501295,2,B004YM6JUA,"Weeds is one of my all-time favorite tv shows and I've seen every season. This is the weakest by far. The storyline wanders around and makes no sense. It's really boring and I could barely finish the season. I've heard Season 8 is just as weak. Maybe they should stopped after season 5 or 6, when it was still a pretty good show.",1361923200,,329,4.238095238095238
4501296,5,B004YM6JUA,Great series. I ca see why it was cancelled cause it hit a nerve too close to home.. riveting and the best series to come out in a long long time.. still waiting for something else to come along...but nothing comes close...NOTHING!,1361491200,,231,4.523809523809524

4501298,5,B004YM6JUA,"Season 7 of Weeds is as stellar as any of the previous seasons.  As Jenji Kohan and Showtime were not certain as to whether the series would conclude at the end of the 7th season, the season finale was written so that it could also serve as a series finale.  As such, it left every imaginable door open for a possible season 8, which did come to eventuality.  The ultimate Season 8 series finale was equally gratifying.",1361318400,,419,4.415584415584416
4501299,3,B004YM6JUA,Not as absorbing as previous series. Maybe the story has exhausted its potential. Loved the earlier work but this one not so much.,1360972800,,130,4.695652173913044

Over and over and over.  Annoying.  I purchased the HD version of the show, have high speed internet, a brand new modem to accomadate the internet speed, but still had issues viewing Weeds in HD.

The character development is good and the plot line, although off the charts to some, is actually believable.  Some people's lives are stranger than fiction and the sub culture depicted in this show creates strange bedfellows and complex dysfunction.  Sometimes the series is hard to watch as the dysfunction of the adults impacts upon and is passed onto the children involved.

4501393,2,B004YM6JUA,"Yeah, I'll admit it. After six seasons, we are addicted to Weeds. Its a nice 26 minute time wasting filler at the end of a long day of work, raising kids, walking the dog, etc.  ... sigh, I guess my personal ""Weeds"" days are long over.

But, while we really enjoyed the first couple of years of most excellent Weeds, and happily chuckled along with the next 4 seasons, I have to ask: what were they thinking with season 7?

Its just not that good. The writing is weak and the plot, as recently as season six being quite silly, is now verging on dumb.

In season 7 the Andy character is woefully under utilized, tho he usually got maybe 2 minutes of the best dialogue per show. Doug sees more lines, and really helps move things along. Shane and Silas are, as always, well acted and engaging or sympathetic. The supporting characters are almost all top shelf. Maybe, just maybe, there were two extended scenes in the whole season that reminded us of the quality of season 1.

The problem is Mary-Louise Parker and her Nancy character.

She isn't that good of an actress and we LOATHE her character. She has become soulless scum.

We'll watch season 8 just to hopefully see her get her just desserts. That, and we are mindless addicted zombies.

One horribly sad concluding note: what the heck happened with the final two minutes of this season? Did the writers literally run out of ideas? It was the biggest let down, no two ways about it, of the entire series. Shame.",1352246400,7,1467,4.488721804511278

The evolution of this show from its almost innocent beginnings in suburban-stereotypical Agrestic to the chic sophisticate it achieved in the grungy, concrete urbania of New York was well worth tolerating the previous nonsense of trailer trash travels. New York gave the characters a new breath which even the absence of my favorite lady, Celia Hodes, couldn't dampen. It's dark. It's cold. It's hard. It's gray. Just like New York itself.

I found Nancy to be extremely irritating and had never felt that way before, so for me, that's a sign it's time to go.

Skipping forward a couple of years helped a little.  It allows the boys to 'age' and keeps the show from bogging down in court scenes.  Unfortunately it took a while to get the new stories going.

If you need a refresher, that's the croquet mallet season finale. I couldn't believe they would end a series in such a bizarre way. Google taught me there were 2 more seasons (6 & 7) and another on the way. Overall, I think it's still worth it and I'm glad I got caught up.  Such great casting with so many genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud moments!  I would like to see a confident Celia return to add some of her much missed humor.  Every time I think I have a favorite character, I remember something about another and I get stuck in a cycle of Andy's priceless wit and sexy sensitivity, Nancy's balls of steel, and Doug's divine intervention that left him around to crack me up with almost every line.

Perhaps the writers were smoking weed of their own while typing up the scripts. Season 7 is a throw-away. The last time I saw a show jump the shark this bad was when Stephen Urkel started inventing jet packs and personality-changing machines on Family Matters. In addition to a lack of drama, season 7 wasn't laugh worthy either. The characters of Andy and Doug were not written nearly as funny as they were in prior seasons.

This was once the funniest show on television, but it has become a boring slog of plot reversal after plot reversal, each more stupidly contrived and ironic then the last.  There just aren't any good laughs anymore, if it wasn't for the Kevin Nealon character there wouldn't be a good line for any of the thirteen episodes (but his screamingly funny ass-rip of two SEC agents in episode 8 is one of the highlights of the whole series).  The Nancy Botwin character has long lost any sympathetic quality she had and has turned into a grotesque loser, to the point that I truly don't care anymore what happens to her, or to any of them.  In fact (without going into a spoiler), when the last few seconds of the final episode had played, all I could think of was:  Good!  What a great place to end it!

That's one of the major reasonas I enjoy this show so much.
Settings change constantly. Actors come and go. Characters change.
Nancy is a drug dealer. You get to see her slowly devolve from honest housewife to drug kingpin.
And what a fascinating journey it is.
For me, a story is more interesting when characters are constantly shifting their views and attitudes. Just like real people.
At times it IS hard to sympathize with Nancy. She seems much colder and harder then she was in earlier seasons.
What people seem to complain about in this series is what I like the most about it.
If you want to watch the same show over and over there are numerous cop or hospital shows that rehash the same tired formulaic storylines ad infinitum.
Love it or hate it WEEDS keeps moving and shaking and making you think.

Season seven picks up three years after the conclusion of season six with Nancy leaving prison. That, aparently, is where the writer(s) must have experienced a major breakdown in creativity.

Before season seven one could enjoy the experience of spreading out watching each week over time. However, with season seven, one finds it necessary to watch the entire season in one sitting, just to get it over with. You might hope for some salvation of Weeds but, nothing really saved season seven.

Still great acting and the presentation showed slight creativity but, with such poor screen writing all that is left is disappointment.

I've stuck with ""Weeds"" through good and bad and defended it even when my opinion was contrary to others (Season 6 was one of my faves) but this is definitely the bottom of the barrel for the once-mighty Showtime series. It's a bad sign when an episode ends and I simply turn off the DVD and don't really care what happens next. Previous seasons had me compulsively watching 3-4 episodes in a row because the plots were so addictive and interesting. Not here, folks. Season 7 offers no excitement, even though we have a flash-forward 3 years and Nancy is now living in a halfway house in New York after her prison stint.

The writers try and give us some bizarre visuals to spice up the proceedings (A group of mimes at a funeral; Silus walking around in a giant transparent beach ball in his underwear at some avante-garde gathering) but everything falls flat.

The finale doesn't get interesting until the last few minutes and I figure there's two ways they can go for Season 8. I don't know if Mary Louise Parker is returning or not; if she is--they will probably make Season 8 a prequel to the final scene of S7.

Diehards like me will want to own this for their collection; everyone else should just rent it. A once-great show is sadly past its prime. Three Stars.",1330905600,9,1288,4.538793103448276

""Weeds: Season Seven""
----------------------------------------------
In my opinion, the last couple of seasons of ""Weeds"" were kind of a drag, pretty strained and super-sharkjumpy. The screenwriters had so thoroughly boxed themselves in by the whole Mexican-mafia thing that they had nowhere to go, and it seemed like the show had ground to a halt. I dutifully picked up Season 7, but didn't have unrealistic hopes about its quality level.

Here's the good news: in a single stroke, the writers leapfrogged past the Mexico story, and placed Nancy and her crew into a completely new situation, sort of like a reality show decamping to a new locale. From being aimlessly on the run and battered by an absurdly cruel universe, they were now in New York City, living the life and having a lot of fun. The new setup allowed all the characters to reboot, and the show's writers to get their groove back. Some of the same plot tics came back, but the show was clearly not in the deep rut it had been in before -- they were being silly and having fun again, they way they had in the first couple of seasons. A lot of the humor derives from the deliciously unpleasant characters -- there's no one here on a par with Nancy's old gal-pal Celia, but Nancy's sister is so unbelievably awful, she does come close. Anyway, S7 is worth a shot... Even if you found yourself drifting away before, you'll want to give them another try this time around. This is a a fun season!

4501565,2,B004YM6JUA,"The length of the Episodes were shortened, the story line was forced and very scattered, too much time invested into Doug, and the sister makes for a very lack luster and watered down version of Mrs. Hodes. I watched the entire season in an afternoon and for that alone I was very discouraged. The Finale alone made me furious, skipping to three months ahead after the show had just skipped 3 years. This was once my favorite show and the only thing I could find to fill the void Buffy left when it went off the air. After season 5 I have regretted buying both season. The show has taken outlandish to a new level and has absolutely crossed the line over to ridiculous.",1330732800,3,669,4.403225806451613

I understand that it hasn't been released that this is the final season but as i can tell by the last episode of this season i don't think certain characters would be able to return although i hope that i am wrong.  In this season you see Nancy return from her stent in jail where she ""uses"" another person to help herself out, she battles with her sister for custody of her youngest son and you catch up with Andy, Sylace, Shane, and surprisingly Doug.  As with all the other seasons she just cant stay away from the only thing she knows how to do which is sell weed.  She finds herself stuck in a half way house where she soon cons her way out as always.  When you catch up with the family you soon realize that they have all grown into their own people and in Andy's case wants out of the drug world to find his own nitch in a bike shop.  Sylace is trying to start his own connection for dealing and surprisingly Shane is trying to get into law enforcment after being forced to go to college by Nancy with her stating ""i gave you three years of my life now you give me four.""

The dialogue and laughs are still sharp as a razor. The new backdrop is a shot of refreshment to a show that, to be honest, didn't really need to get any fresher. They haven't stopped moving forward with character development or the setting since season 2.

I think the only reason I will watch season 8 is because of the cliffhanger it left at the end of the last episode.",1329868800,7,413,4.175
4501571,2,B004YM6JUA,"I liked ""Weeds"" up to about Season 6.  But Season 7 was definitely a disappointment.  I know that the show is a bit of a fantasy but it just seemed to get past the point where I'm willing to suspend disbelief and into territory where I say, ""This is just silly."" Such moments included...

<spoilers>

-the idea that the Securities Exchange Commission would collude with a corrupt venture capital business because its retirement funds were tied up with it.

-the moment in the show where Nancy's former lesbian lover, her current lover (the lesbian's brother), and her putative new boyfriend (played by Aidan Quinn) all showed up at her apartment at the sametime

-the idea that Shane Bodwin would enter the police academy to keep what has got to be the stupidest fictional cop in screenwriting history from busting his mom

<end spoilers>

But beyond the silliness, I think the show and the characters just have changed too much.  Even though I don't use drugs (never have), I remember thinking while watching the early episodes, ""Yes, I can see how someone would could drift into a life of crime because she had to survive and keep her family together."" But the Nancy of season 7 is a very far cry from that sympathetic soccer mom of seasons 1 to 3.

In my opinion, it was a mistake to take Nancy and her clan out of the suburban domain of Egrestic.  I know that they did so because they supposedly felt the characters had to grow, but the show to me was the most compelling when it was poking fun at suburban sanctimoniousness and hypocrisy.

I also miss Nancy's nemesis/friend Celia and Dean and Isabelle.

I figure I will watch season 8 because it's always possible the authors might decide to move the show to something slightly more realistic and appealing but I'm not very confident that will happen.",1329091200,5,1807,4.644654088050315

She uses and treats her brother in law like crap. She dominates her kids, making them her little puppets. She lies to her kids about very important things, then cries the victim when confronted. She dresses super sleazy for a upper middle aged woman. She can't act. I was surprised she was nominated for any awards. She treated her brother in law with no respect and expected him to always be there and cater to her. I don't understand why any man would be attracted to her. She treats her friends horribly. She uses everyone she comes in contact with. I had really hoped she would change as a person, but that never happened. The brother in law and oldest son were the best actors. I found myself hoping and wishing bad things would happen to her. At the end, a few people distanced themselves from her, which was good and best for them. She was a horrible person. I didn't think there were any comical parts. The acting was horrible, especially the main character. I'm really sad that I wasted all that time watching this show and hating her and her character so intensely. I'm sad that I hoped through every episode, bad things would happen to her.
