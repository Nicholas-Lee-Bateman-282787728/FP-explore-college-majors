8373244,4,B002LQYWNW,"I really liked this video.  I found the tricks interesting, the performer engaging, and the format instructive.  The only reason I did not give this DVD 5 stars was that the production values were really bad. Terrible.  This was filmed in a back room of a magic shop during what sounded like business hours - Phones were ringing, watches were beeping, and people were talking.  I felt sorry that Mr. Wood had to deal with all of that. It also would have been nice to have more than one camera rolling for closeups, etc.

The format was:
I. introduction to mentalism (prediction, force, multiple outs)
II. 5 tricks (mental choice, testing for esp, hoy book test, jumbo card prediction, and the editor)
III. Conclusion (tips for your routine)

the runtime was about 1.25 hours.

Mr. Wood performed each trick and then explained how it was done.  He also offered many tips on how to adapt the trick for different scenarios.  It was all very well done and the tips were thoughtful and obviously based on experience.

I really liked Peter Wood's ""Mastering Mentalism"" and would buy other instructional videos by him.  I recommend this DVD to those new to magic and mentalism.",1350518400,6,1170,4.742574257425742
