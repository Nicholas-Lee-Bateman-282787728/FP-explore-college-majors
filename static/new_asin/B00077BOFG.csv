2202975,3,B00077BOFG,"This is a rather tame remake of a movie whose original version is clearly superior. For all of Law's obvious talents, he is no Michael Cane. That isn't exactly a valuable criticism, as few actors can even aspire toward Cane's tact, intelligence and skill. I think the difference here is that Michael Cane's brilliance is such that, even at his age, he probably could have enlivened the predictable and dull script for ""Alfie II."" While other reviewers below have cleverly picked up on the more recent film's ability to expose the sophistication and changes in attitudes toward gender and sexuality that have occurred since the first Alfie, still there is a hollowness lingering over this film that it never quite manages to escape from. The film's refusal to look away from themes such as abortion, which was virtually ignored by Hollywood in Cane's prime, would have made this remake seem necessary if these details were not so abruptly and conveniently tossed into the narrative. The story relies so heavily upon Alfie's coming-of-age that it demands more from its script than it can deliver within the movie's austere time constraints. Most damaging though is that this Alfie's revelations and fortune-cookie advice on the art of seduction are never quite as revelatory or interesting as the script pretends. Ironically, none of this film's failures speak louder than the director's ingenious and quirky presentation of the material, which comes off as a kind of band-aid over the script's pedestrian tone. Like most ambitious failures, though, this one is not all bad. Especially moving is the concluding sequence in which Alfie condemns himself for never reciprocating affection as we watch a series of brief, nostalgic flashbacks from his illustrious love life. Additionally, the surprisingly impassioned music by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart of Eurythmics makes this one of the year's finest soundtracks. Who knew rock's most famous tongue still had a few decent songs left in him? But the bottom line about the film itself is that the things Alfie learns along his little hedonistic journey are not things we didn't already know, and even though they might confirm some private fears or suspicions of our own, the self-recognition this movie tries to force on its audience is not the kind that sticks with you as you're driving home. Even so, I think it speaks well for the film that my preoccupation with its flaws stems from a belief in its potential, which is obvious from first minute to last. At least there was THAT much.",1099958400,8,2535,5.009478672985782
2202976,1,B00077BOFG,"The previews look good.  The leading man looks VERY good.  He wears Prada & Gucci.  It takes place in Manhattan.  He's even manages to look sexy driving a baby blue Vespa!  So, what went wrong?  And why did it take 2 hours for me to figure it out while others were walking out of the theater about 5 minutes? I think I kept hoping that it would get better...or at least catch some skin/peek at Jude in his Birthday Suit.  :-) Pssst...don't hold your breath.

I won't give any details (there aren't many anyway) as to the content of Alfie.  He's pondering the meaning of life and ""what's it all about?"".

I'm still wondering ""What was I thinking and why didn't I let one my friends spend her $7.95 to see if before me?????",1099872000,11,721,4.313432835820896
2202977,4,B00077BOFG,"Critics and audiences alike seem to be approaching this remake of ALFIE with a tar-and-feather approach that may in fact keep audiences away from a film that is very good.  No one seems to mind the endless 'remakes' of biblical stories, of Shakespeare, of heist films like The Thomas Crown Affair and The Italian Job and Nine Queens etc, so why all the fuss about rethinking ALFIE?

Yes, the original film introduced a cad perfectly portrayed by Michael Caine who used his lothario personality to the detriment of every woman he bedded.  Watch it again: it is depressing.  This updating of ALFIE as directed with panache by Charles Shyer takes into account the fact that women have changed in the last half century, that they no longer fall helpless victim to the stud du jour despite the fact that they enjoy his sexual prowess and inherent charm.  The women in this version of ALFIE actually have gotten a grip and have a life and refuse to be devastated by their transient passion for the fantasy driven, commitment-phobic, handsome young limousine driver.  At the end of the day, the title song's opening phrase of ""What's it all about, Alfie?"" is driven home to a good hearted cad who sees too late that honest love is more important than a running list of conquests.

Jude Law makes the character of Alfie entirely his own and his performance is first class.  The one annoying aspect of this film is in the method of narration: Alfie talks to us, the audience, directly and is most out of place when during conversations with other actors he looks out at the audience to offer asides.  This technique of course goes back to Greek theater and certainly to Shakespeare, but in a story that moves as fast as ALFIE it is distractingly, plastically artificial.

The women cast in this film do fine ensemble acting: Susan Sarandon (who has one of the best moments in the film - when Alfie asks her why she is sleeping with someone else she embarrassingly replies 'He is younger than you!'): Marisa Tomei, Sienna Miller, Jane Krakowski, and Nia Long.  And Omar Epps as Alfie's fellow limo driver, the one who seems to know him best, is strong.

Recommendation: break the mold and see ALFIE for yourself.  It is a fine little film that makes a strong statement on just how far women have come on the ladder of respect away from macho victimization.  Grady Harp, November 2004",1099872000,3,2373,4.673076923076923
2202978,3,B00077BOFG,"""What's it all about?"" is a line from the song ""Alfie"" and the running theme throught the movie. Well this movie is all about Jude Law, who turns in a terrific performance and brightens this weak remake of the late 1960's film of the same name.

Alfie (Law) is a cockney Englishman transplanted in New York. By day, he picks up passenger as a limo driver. By night, well, he picks up one beautiful woman after another as a man about town. His conquests are diverse: a wild party girl, a lonely single mother, a high flying cosmetics executive. He dreams of starting a limo company with his best friend, but he truly only has energy and drive for his all consuming obsession with sleeping with women.

Alfie's hobby eventually runs him into trouble. While he doesn't mean to hurt anyone, he ends up hurting everyone, most notably himself. This remake deleted some of the gutsier, grittier moments from the original. Still, the seamier side of his life is examined.

Law's performance makes the movie (though there are some good supporting performances from Susan Sarandon and Sienna Miller). If you don't like Jude Law, you should probably skip ""Alfie."" If you do, well then, this is your movie!",1099699200,13,1194,4.730769230769231
2202979,5,B00077BOFG,"If you are a Jude Law fan, then you will enjoy Alfie.  I have not seen the original, but I can say that this remake makes me want to see the difference between these two movies.

Charles Shyer, one of the best director's of remakes, such as the Father of the Bride movies and Parent Trap, helps to make Law radiate charisma when he is on the screen.

Alfie is a ladies' man who lives in Manhattan where all the women are gorgeous and he wants to meet every beautiful one of them.  I like how is character evolves from being a complete, commitment phobe jerk to a more enlighten individual realizing he might want more than just a one-night stand.

All of the performances are really good with knockout performances by all of his leading ladies(Marisa Tomei, Jane Krakowski, Nia Long, Sienna Miller, and most definitely Susan Sarandon).

If you want to see a good movie and you are a Jude Law fan, then Alfie is the ticket for you.",1099612800,9,930,4.409356725146199
2202980,3,B00077BOFG,"Charles Shyer has directed many fun films including the ""Father of the Bride"" series: all pleasant films without much personal vision but competent and sometimes even better than that. So why Shyer decided to tackle the story of Alfie Elkins and re-make the glorious, nasty, ironic, sometimes vulgar 1960's classic starring an acerbic Michael Caine, I will never know. For what emerges from the screen in this remake starring Jude Law as Alfie, is a watered-down, scrubbed, sanitized Alfie: more palatable than the original, but a hell of lot less interesting, which is not to say that Law is not charming, handsome and fun as the New Millennium Casanova. Except for maybe, ""Enemy at the Gates,"" Law can do no wrong in my book. And because of that, and Law has played bad guys before, remember ""Road to Perdition?"" Law was an inspired choice for this role.
Updated to 2004 and transferred to the gloriously photographed NYC, in which everyone looks like a Model, ""Alfie"" is confronted with post feminist women who, for the most part, use Him as much as he does them. Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, Nia Long (so beautiful) and Sienna Miller, dressed and made up to look like Julie Christie, are amazing in their roles: the lot of them bursting with Love and Affection but not willing to put up with Alfie's guff which only helps to de-fang poor 2004 Alfie.
Whereas Caine as Alfie has no idea if he is much less why he is a louse, Law's Alfie does and feels bad about it. Well, OK. But this self-awareness has no place in the world of Alfie and because Shyer and his writer have decided to turn him into a feminist, ""Alfie"" unfortunately knows all too well what it's all about.",1099612800,26,1674,4.63973063973064
2202981,5,B00077BOFG,"As a rule, I think remakes of successful films are a rotten idea.  In virtually every instance the original surpasses the newer film in almost every aspect.  This remake of the classic 1966 ALFIE starring Michael Caine, however, is an exception to the rule.  It doesn't efface memories of that film or Caine's absolutely outstanding performance, but it does provide a successful alternative.  Is it better than the original film?  That will depend on taste.  I personally prefer the mood and atmosphere of the earlier film, and it is impossible to imagine anyone better than the young Michael Caine in the title role, though Jude Law unquestionably does a good job.  The difference in their conceptions of the role is that Caine's Alfie was a far nastier character, while beneath his gamemanship and bravado, Law's is a gigolo with a heart of gold.

I personally think that this will be the movie that puts Law over the top as one of the premiere stars in the movies.  He has been an A-List actor for some time now, but I think he has been, perhaps, more of an A-minus than a pure A.  But after the plethora of films featuring Law this fall, he has never been as much a public presence as he is now.  He is a full A-List actor, and certain to be one of the two or three most in demand male leads in the industry.  This may not end up being the best movie he is in, but it is unquestionably the best role.  Law is a presence in every minute of the film, much of it with him directly addressing the camera.  The technique closely resembles that of John Cusack's character in HIGH FIDELITY, so that the film at times feels almost as much a remake of that film as of ALFIE.  The film has a strong supporting cast, but really in a movie like this, where absolutely everything is focused on a single character, it all flies or falls depending on Law's performance.  Luckily for the film, he is outstanding.

The original film had, of course, one of the most famous theme songs in the history of cinema.  The soundtrack is suitably up-to-date, but they obviously made the decision not to attempt to compete with that song, although it makes a very brief appearance as the company credits role at the beginning of the film, and the film does close with Law's Alfie essentially quoting a line from the song.

I used to love reading Pauline Kael's movie reviews, though she constantly lost me when she would make bizarre shifts in her narrative, such as ceasing to discuss the film to analyzing aspects of Mozart.  I'm going to do a ""Kael"" right now and confess that during the entire film I kept thinking of a section of the first volume of Kierkegaard's EITHER/OR entitled ""The Rotation Method.""  In that work, Kierkegaard suggests that for someone who is living an aesthetic (and hence pre-ethical) life, it is important to do such things as avoid emotional entanglements, eschew committed relationships, and constantly shake things up in one's life (i.e., rotate things as a farmer rotates his crops).  The problem with an aesthetic existence is that it is a fragile one, and if one does not avoid long-term entanglements, the entire existence is threatened with either boredom or, worse, a sense of guilt.  I kept viewing Alfie as one who was attempting to lead a fairly crude aesthetic mode of existence (based especially upon sensual pleasure), but was finding it increasingly difficult as one thing after another created cracks in the texture of his life.  At the end of the film we do not see a moral individual, but we do see one for whom the aesthetic mode of existence has lost its allure, and for whom an ethical existence has become a possibility.

I think with this film that we are in one of those rare instants where we have both a superb original film and a very good remake, much as we have two very good CAPE FEARs.  I might have a slight preference for the original, but I certainly respect the remake.",1098316800,43,3913,4.570200573065903
2202982,5,B00077BOFG,"I caught a pre-screening of ""Alfie"" and it's easily one of the best movies of the year.  Jude Law soars higher than the ""Sky Captain"" as a charming lothario who learns some lessons about life and love the hard way.  He's supported by a strong cast of females including Susan Sarandon as a scorchingly hot older gal.  Charles Shyer's direction is energetic and potent.  Like ""Hamlet,"" the character of ""Alfie"" is a classic role that a new generation can enjoy through a marvelous actor's interpretation.  This is Jude Law's signature role, helmed by one of Hollywood's classiest directors.",1094860800,6,588,4.959183673469388

Make no mistake, this is not a chick flick, the way it can seem. This is really kind of more for the male ""Entourage"" crew of fans. I am sorry that it was pretty much marketed as a chick flick when it came out. I think it suffered for it in popularity, as in the wrong audience came to see it.

2203051,4,B00077BOFG,Some reviewers compare this Alfie negatively with the Michael Caine 1966 version.  I think Jude Law's Alfie can stand on its own as a modern Don Juan who gradually wakes up to the fact that love isn't finally satisfying when you are careful to be only on the receiving end.

2203068,3,B00077BOFG,"I had completely forgotten the 1966 original starring Michael Caine bar the vague memories that it was about a working class Cockney playboy who talked to the camera throughout the movie and that Shelley Winters was at her screaming best in this. Other than that, I had no recollection of the first Alfie.

That's a good thing because this version with Jude Law seems to show the character himself is not dated and all that was needed was to update the women in his life. This is where the extras are a great help as they intersperse the stories of both the 1966 movie and this one to give you a great idea of how each is every so slightly different. I will say one thing: The women in this one are all babes (Marisa Tomei, Nia Long, Jane Krakowski, Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon) unlike the 1966 one which seemed to focus on the homely rather than the dropdead gorgeous.

Maybe that was the point in 1966 but as far as a moviegoer I want my eye candy!

The movie was much more than I expected. It starts off with Law as the usual playboy type and evolves into something much deeper, very contemporary and gives you far more insight into relationships without devolving into some sort of lame wimpy chick flick.

It's also a very hip and cool looking movie from Alfie's Vespa to Sarandon's pad to Sienna Miller's tres hip 21st century NYC girl cool.

In the end it's Jude Law who pulls the whole thing off with just the right smile or offhand comment that hits the mark in the delivery.

The extras are terrific as beyond the usual commentary tracks and deleted scenes are a look at how the original music for the movie was put together by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart (having mentioned them the music really did not do a lot for me as it did sound dated like something from the 1970s), a look at the world of Alfie and the women in his life which is where we get the 1966 comparisons often side-by-side onscreen as well as some others which I won't give away here.",1304726400,,1968,4.363387978142076

2203070,2,B00077BOFG,"Alfie (2005) Jude Law, Susan Sarandon

With all the scripts that funnel into Hollywood like so many lemmings to the sea, one has to wonder why the studios decide to do these 60s & 70s remakes. Already done material, apparently, is easier to re-shoot than dealing with fresh material and a fresh author to haggle over a price with. But easier money usualy ends in disappointing movies. This Alfie re-make is no exception.

The Michael Caine/Jude Law comparison is going to be inevitable of course as Mr. Law steps up to the plate for this 26th film of his in 10 years - plying his chameleon character capabilities in roles as diverse as an AI and a Civil War soldier.

At the time of this movie remake, Mr. Caine was the record holder for 103 films in his 48 years of movie making. Caine, however, has made more movies in the past 4 years - lots of 'em. And so has Law. So who know whom will win this British actor workaholic movie marathon??

But on to this film. Alfie is a story about a cad in London who loves & leaves women as regularly as he changes his underwear, but must come to terms with the consequences of his callous actions by film's end. The Jude Law remake takes place in New York and his ""older woman"" is Susan Sarandon - as opposed to Caine's older woman who was Shelly Winters. I'd say Law is getting the better end of the stick here.",1238025600,,1353,4.31496062992126

to the life style of the young and shameless?
I ask where the pathos is here?
The idea was to discourage sexual partner
indiscrimination in the young,
but Alfie is certainly not devastated enough by half in the end for all the bed hopping in between
and betraying his best friend.
The young people will still want to be an ""Alfie"".

However, I am a fan of the original Alfie, and I was most uncomfortable watching this DVD -- just resenting the fact that it's OK, but not the genuine article.

Sorry, I just didn't love it.",1202774400,,333,4.442622950819672
2203076,4,B00077BOFG,"This movie is a remake of a 1966 movie of the same name in which Michael Caine portrayed the leading character.  This time around, Jude Law takes a crack @ playing Alfie.  I've actually not seen the 1966 version so I can't comment much on that.  However, the special features of the DVD compare & contrast a great many aspects of the 2004 version vs. the original.  It's readily apparent that several of the characters (i.e.:  Alfie's women) have been updated to the 21st century milieu.

Alfie is a commit-o-phobic playboy who lives a carefree, day-to-day life.  Carpe Diem would be his mantra that he lives by.  He certainly has no trouble picking up women, so many may ask what the ""problem"" is.  Of course, the problem is that Alfie himself ends up asking this very question.

Well, the issue is that his decisions have an effect on other people, and frequently these effects are negative.  Alfie is kind of like an octopus that has his tentacles wrapped around the lives of other persons, and the negative repurcussions of his sometimes rash decisions eventually come back to drown the octopus.

One of the most favorable aspects of the movie is the inclusion of Sienna Miller.  She is an up-and-coming star who has grabbed my attention.  She is a lovely young woman, and she also has genuine acting skills and a very credible screen-presence.  In the current film she plays a sort of Britney Spears type of woman;  drop dead gorgeous, but unpredictable, volatile and emotionally unstable.  She's brought to mind a great many women I've known in my own life!!

The weakest part of the cast, for me, was Susan Sarandon.  I know she has a lot of fans & followers and admirers and that's all good & well.  It's just that, in truth, she's never moved me.  In the present film she's supposed to be an older woman who is still a goddess post-50.  For me, this doesn't really ""work"" as I've never thought that Sarandon was that hot to begin with.  Her acting doesn't really make up the ground for the non-believability of her pulling off this particular role.  Again, this is my opinion.

A lot of people are bound to find this film boring.  To be sure, there is not a lot of ""action"" in it.  The film is very subtle and is focused on relationships.  It's quite introspective, with Alfie frequently going off on Shakespearesque soliloquies.  Many people may not find this appealing (and some may even find it archaic), but I enjoy these types of films.",1194134400,9,2450,4.619489559164733

2203078,2,B00077BOFG,"Jude Law is a fine actor and does his usual excellent job in this remake. If you've never seen the original you'd probably think it was a decent enough movie. But if you've seen the original, with Michael Caine, you'd be wondering why they bothered to make this in the first place- especially the butchered version that resulted.

Like a lot of latter day remakes, this is very much a prettified version of the original.  All of Law's conquests have model good looks- as does Law himself, for that matter. He's also a good deal more refined, in accent and in manners, unlike Caine's rather crude Cockney. He moves about in beautiful surroundings. And that loses an essential element of the setting of the novel. Alfie did not live in a beautiful world, and his conquests were not necessarily beautiful women; in large part they were women whom someone else desired- and that was what compelled him to seduce them.

Caine's (and the novel's) Alfie exploited weak women; for whatever reason, the director, or perhaps the producers, decided this Alfie's conquests had to be modern, strong women who use him as much as he uses them. That of course makes Alfie a good deal less of a cad; Jude Law's Alfie is not leaving behind the wrecked lives that Caine's did, and he becomes almost sympathetic at one point- a sentiment completely absent in the book and the original movie.

In the end, this version misses the essential Alfie- his inability to recognize flaws in himself, even as he rationalizes his actions and convinces himself that he's doing the right thing. The result is a shallow character study completely lacking the depth and impact of the original.",1183939200,36,1658,4.7665505226480835

Michael Caine as an older bachelor still up to his old tricks. I even got to thinking how he and Shelly Winters  could have another go at it.

I've never met them, but fantasy is what Hollywood is about.  Back to Mick...how did the movie get him to score the wonderful songs here and Dave Stewart is so great, please Eurythmic reunion is overdue (forget the Police).

That's a blessing because I don't have to make unfair comparisons and judge this version on it's own merits.  And it is smashing.  This is a film that promotes morality and fidelity despite the central character being a cad.  The movie is at once pro-woman and pro-life.  I wouldn't say that Alfie gets so much as a comeuppance but an education in human relationships.  Credit Jude Law, one of our finest actors, for making a seemingly smarmy character sympathetic.  The film also sports one of the stronger ensemble cast of actresses you'll find in any film.  Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, and Jane Krakowski are certainly good but the performances that struck me most were from Nia Long as Alfie's best friend's girl and Sienna Miller as Alfie's manic-depressive girlfriend.

Alfie's a smooth talking Londoner in New York who does his very best to avoid succumbing to the dreaded 'c' word commitment. Along the way, we're introduced to some of his ladies on the go - Dorie, Julie, Liz and Nikki, to name but a few.

Alfie, a chauffeur, lives in a small Manhattan apartment and dedicates his life to seducing women. Talking directly into the camera, and preening with a self-satisfaction so complete as to seem a form of innocence, he expounds on clothes, the proper application of cologne and the various rules he employs in his libidinous pursuits. His goal, it seems, is to have sex with as many women as possible but to get close to none of them.

Each one starts off as a fling, but somehow manages to influence Alfie's life. He slowly starts to realize that he is actually alone and that there is more to life than what he has done so far.

Would I recommend it? Definitely. Although remakes do not usually come through smelling of roses, this one does. It's fresh, colourful and funny. Jude Law is magnificent, introducing us to a slightly warmer side of Alfie than Michael Caine.",1176940800,14,1318,4.497907949790795

He has to keep up with his appearances by wearing the right clothes and saying the right words.

As much fun as he is having, he has a couple of sharp turns--impregnating his friend's girlfriend and having a medical scare. Yet he still continues to do what he does best--woo them and dump them.

This movie isn't about one person doing what he does for sport, it also shows how gullible and pressed women can be when it comes to men who use their charms to feed them a fantasy. Despite the critics less than stellar raves, this movie was good.",1171756800,4,836,4.318471337579618

In the remake with Jude Law, Jude Law smirks after every comment he makes which he thinks is funny (but is hardly clever, unless you're a total loser and you live an unadventurous lifestyle with no romantic prospects).  He seems to think his comments to the camera are shocking.

For someone who's got his s--- together, this movie is totally dull.  In the entire remake, Alfie makes a comment which he thinks makes him seem so indifferent, but then he ruins what might at least have been a b movie, by smirking at the camera for 8 seconds of nothing, as though letting you in on some devilishly adventurous and carefree life; his noticeable attempt to fashion of coy smile on his face only throws him out of character and makes me think he was a loser yesterday, a born loser at heart, who somehow got thrown into a scenario where he's sleeping with a lot of women now, and that he can't handle that.  Not of a man who is a born ""b_stard magnet,"" who couldn't care less about the girls and has so much experience with women that he no longer finds it funny or very noteworthy.

Compared to my life, his life is slightly duller.  He just draws attention to his being such a ""bad boy"" (gasp), which obviously makes him a big loser.

I nearly killed myself after 10 minutes of watching this.

2203113,3,B00077BOFG,"The film has an interesting start and Jude Law gave it all he could. He wears a pink shirt in the movie, rides on a scooter, plays mr. cuteguy and a whole lot many other things to portray Alfie's character. The film falls flat on its face in the last half an hour. The conclusion is ""abrupt"" and ""foreceful"" as if it somehow get the audience to swallow it.

Do not watch this movie unless you're a lady who finds Law cute.

I've come to realise Jude Law doesnt do any worthwhile movies anymore. ""Gattaca"" remains his best film.

Jude Law is fun to watch and he really gets into the role and the women are well cast in each role...Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny, Only You), Sienna Miller (Layer Cake), Susan Sarandon (Elizabethtown, Bull Durham), Jane Krakowski (Ally McBeal,GO) and Nia Long (Baadaaaaas!). It doesnt have what the original 1966 Michael Caine movie he had but Law sure carries his own in this one.

2203116,3,B00077BOFG,"Acting by the entire cast was damn good. What kept this from being a keeper in my DVD collection was the script-Character conversations are a bit trite, exhibiting all the back-n-forth verbal luster of a 1950's dime store novel. Law starts out a bit rocky, perhaps owing to the ""talking directly to the camera"" point of view, but this soon becomes more than bearable as the film progresses- It just takes a bit of getting used to. The biggest fault in Alfie's world is his ""what could have been"" paranoia in relationships, always believing there is someone better out there beyond the time he spends with his current (sometimes multiple) love interests. But, at least his character goes through a progression: starting out with a carefree attitude with women, eventually mounting into a man with a bit of depth and understanding , and ultimately realizing the true importance of loving....At least I think that's where the movie was going.",1126828800,14,939,4.911949685534591
2203117,3,B00077BOFG,"You cannot expect Caine's hardness of the original, which was made in the mid-60s, the time of revolution and swinging London.  You could be hip and anti-social back then, but not now.  The new version reflects that fact.

'Alfie' is surprisingly good with Jude Law perfectly cast as Alfie, unrepentant womanizing man who knows he is very handsome.  The new film is, like the original, all about Alfie, or his lifestyle, so the story is not very important.  Please keep that in mind.

[JUDE LAW IS VERY GOOD] Probably more than half of the film's (easy) charms come from Jude Law as Alfie, an Englishman in New York working as a limo driver.  He meets women, sleeps with them, but somehow -- this is the point -- somehow we are led to share his views when he actually is a hopeless case of a cad.  For him, dating women is workshop for showing off his views about relations, career, fashion, or sex.  Just like 'Sex in the City.'

So Alfie meets many women, including Marisa Tomei, Nia Long, Jane Krakowski, Sienna Miller, and Susan Sarandon.  The female characters are not particularly memorable -- they are there to provide the occasions for Alife to give humorous comments on men and women (some are directly addressed to camera), and Jude Law delivers them in his delightful, witty talk.

Alfie's too honest views on women are often selfish ones in nature, but he is very self-conscious at the same time, knowing how to convince us, and Jude Law gets easily in character.  You may not like Alfie, but you still keep on watching him.

For all Jude Law's good acting, and equally good score by Mick Jagger/Dave Stewart, the newer 'Alfie' gets awfully sentimental at times.  Being sentimantal is no problem at all with me, but in 'Alfie' Charles Shyer offers too many chances for Alfie to be in a tearful mood.  Newer Alfie gets soft too often, and when it is boring (like some episodes about Alfie's pal Omar Epps), it is really boring.

One of the three recent remakes of Michale Caine films (after 'Get Carter' and 'The Italian Job'), 'Alfie' is not bad as you may think.  Maybe mellow, but witty all the same.",1126051200,11,2114,4.606951871657754
2203118,2,B00077BOFG,"Although I totally disagree with his descriptive adjectives over earlier, Michael Caine...that Jude Law's version of Alfie is all three: ""watered-down, scrubbed and sanitized"" gigolo/playboy in relating to healthy Lassies, Sienna, Marisa & Susan, it appears to me that each one used him in widely divergent ways!

I cannot agree with any reviewer that Jude Law remotely fulfills his ""sanitized, scrubbed, watered-down"" idea of this obsessive, compulsive character; Even with an over-healthy, wealthy, Susan Sarandon! In fact, his escapades left me unimpressed, under-sea, at-odds with Director Shyer's Movie! Enough...an older retired, Chaplain Fred W Hood",1125532800,9,656,5.905263157894737
2203119,3,B00077BOFG,"It's something that gets many double standards: we tolerate having **** buddies and many relationships that are entirely based on sex yet we call men and women sl*ts for doing the same thing. With Alfie, in a long string of unnecessary remakes, we have Jude Law playing the titular character who gets what's coming to him, only we still sympathize, if only for the performance.

Alfie is basically what women always complain about when it comes down to men. That all men are just after sex, nothing more despite the fact women are also after the same thing(I always used to say that men and women are both after sex, it's just women are better at hiding it). So we have Alfie going from woman to woman with no remorse until it bites him in the ass.

There's a basic repetitive and very noticeable structure: meets girl, screws girl, dates girl, meets new girl but realizing the errors of his ways tries to win back the other girls. The girls range from somewhat interesting(Jane Krakowski and Nia Long's character), incredibly interesting one being Marisa Tomei and the other being my favorite new actress Sienna Miller. Yeah there's all that attention on Jude(they met on this film) and his nanny affair but she is a capable actress but like Cris Judd, they get attention solely for something else.

The women do their job which is to teach Alfie a thing or 2 and look cute doing it(although I prefer Nia Long's long straight hair rather than the 'fro she's got here. Like I said, Sienna Miller in my mind steals the film, not only causes she's so damn gorgeous but you really get that heartbreak when Alfie dumps her(particularly her facial expressions). As for Mr. I'm in Every Movie Jude Law, he's got the charm of Alfie but maybe not that chauvinistic pic aspect although his breakdown in the car is effective.

It's another entry of a long line of remakes that could've been something else but as usual, better to just leave it. See it for Sienna and Marisa though.

FYI: Cris Judd was Jennifer Lopez's(I refuse to call her that ridiculous moniker ""J.Lo"" ex husband. Told you he got recognition for something other than what he does.",1123977600,10,2139,4.648148148148148

2203122,3,B00077BOFG,"The genre of love-drama's that delve deep into the lives of sex addicts, heart breakers, and those naiive to the ways of love, have always interested me.  I had been looking forward to seeing this film for quite sometime. It contained a knockout cast of Jude Law, Marissa Tomei, and Omar Epps.

The introduction to the movie starts of strong.  Alfy narrates his storybook existence in New York, and quickly introduces us to his style, feelings, and women.  We find Alfy to be someone who can not stick with one girl.  He is dependent of all the women in his life and finds an emotional attachment with many of them.

Midway through the movie i realized that the plot had not progressed since the first 20 minutes of the movie.  I had already got a taste of what Alfie's life was like, and it was time for the movie to take me on a ride of excitement, an emotional rollercoaster was expected.  But the movie begins to get EXTREMELY repetitive.  He meets a great girl, dumps her. Meets a great girl, dumps her.  Trys to get a girl back, doesn't happen.

Another problem with this movie was that none of the secondary characters are developed in entirity.  Alfie himself we get to know WAY to well, while his best friend, girlfriends, confidants, we develop no connection with.  I end up not caring what happens to any of the characters as the movie drags into oblivion.

My recommendation is save this movie for when you are REALLY bored.  I'd watch Swingers 10 more times before i watched this movie again.",1122163200,12,1505,4.5427509293680295
2203123,5,B00077BOFG,"I enjoyed the movie. A nice looking english guy with some metrosexual look is chasing girls. He looks gentle and sensitive, and first you kinda like him. But eventually all his girls are looking for something more then just sex and actually find it with other guys. Then Alfie realizes that he is not a winner in this game. It's not him dumping the girls. It's actually him being dumped and that finally makes him suffer.

The film is full of nice scenes, fine details and well played emotions. Story, visual line, some moral - and everything is well balanced.",1121558400,4,560,4.6
2203124,4,B00077BOFG,"I was a bit put off this movie by the bad reviews but I must say I throughly enjoyed it.  I liked Alfie talking to us.  I found Jude Law very appealing in the role.  This is the first one I actually liked him in.  And what is it about Marissa Tomei?  She brings something to every role she plays, no matter how small or large, that lights up the screen.",1121126400,4,353,3.915492957746479
2203125,4,B00077BOFG,"Alfie struck me as a most unusual film.  I haven't seen the original version of the film featuring Michael Caine, so I went into this film with no expectations as to how things would play out.  Things certainly didn't end the way I thought they would - but that it almost surely a good thing.  Jude Law's modern Alfie doesn't deserve a fairy tale ending - indeed, such a flowery ending would have betrayed the real meaning of the entire film.  Alfie is a charming little devil, but he's the worst kind of man - a womanizer who leaves broken hearts in his wake as he evades commitment and rushes ever onwards to more women, more cheap thrills, and ever more self-satisfaction.  It's hard for me to feel too sorry for a guy like this when he eventually discovers that he's nothing but an empty shell and begins to look longingly at the things he doesn't have.  He does come to understand exactly what he is by the end of the movie, but I'm not sure he ever reaches the point of redemption.  Every time there seems to be some hope that he will change his life, he falls right back into the lifestyle he is supposedly growing tired of.  It's important to note that, at the end, he is basically asking ""what's it all about?""  He still doesn't know - he's been hurt the very way he has hurt so many others, but he never goes beyond the pain to find moral redemption.

Alfie works his way through a number of women in this story: the unhappily married Dorie (Jane Krakowski from Alley McBeal); Julie (Marisa Tomei), the single mother who pretty much starts Alfie wondering about his priorities in life; Lonette (Nia Long), his best friend's girl and ultimately the instrument of Alfie's most painful lesson about his lifestyle; Nikki (Sienna Miller), a somewhat tragic manic-obsessive; and the rich, mature Liz (Susan Sarandon - and, if I'd known she was in this movie, I never would have watched it).  When you come right down to it, Alfie is really just a stupid, stupid man who can't even figure out what he should want, yet regrets not having it.  I'm not saying he's not intelligent - but he is stupid.  No matter how much he wants to change, nothing manages to change him - not a most embarrassing little problem, a health scare involving the favorite part of his body, or even his ultimate realization of how much he has hurt his best friend.  The ending is pretty much open-ended, so hope is not lost - but I'm not optimistic for this character, given his track record as shown in this film.

I should clearly state that I think Alfie is a good film - almost a very good film.  Jude Law does an excellent job portraying a man who is much more complex than it might seem - and he manages to make all of his little soliloquies to the audience very effective, as they basically provide the insight into whatever soul is lurking behind Alfie's charm and carefree attitude.  There's a real, tragically flawed person in there, a man who can't seem to change no matter how much he wants to.  Had they wrapped the film's ending up in a pretty little bow, I would have extremely critical of this film.  As it is, I seem to like this movie more, the more I reflect upon it - and that's a sign of quality film-making and good story-telling.",1119657600,3,3230,4.434856175972927
2203126,5,B00077BOFG,"""Alfie"" became one of my favorite films of 2004.  I found the personal growth that the character experiences to be the point of the film and why it was so moving for me.  Director Charles Shyer got his lone Oscar nomination as screenwriter for the 1980 Goldie Hawn hit ""Private Benjamin"" & has had success with remakes of ""Father of the Bride"" in 1991 with Steve Martin & ""The Parent Trap"" in 1998.  For me, ""Alfie"" is an ambitious and masterful weave of story, character and cinematography.  I enjoyed the presence of signs that punctuate the visual look of the film.  Jude Law's performance is breathtaking.  After Oscar nominations for ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" & ""Cold Mountain,"" his portrayal of Alfie balances superficiality, vanity & self-centeredness with loneliness, romanticism & self-discovery.  All of this is unified with Law's charming personality, good looks and the actor's amazing breadth of emotional reach.  Marisa Tomei as the girlfriend Julie does an excellent job, being the ""true love"" squandered.  With her Oscar for ""My Cousin Vinny"" & nomination for ""In the Bedroom,"" she is one of Hollywood's most excellent and underrated talents.  Omar Epps who did a great job with Meg Ryan in ""Against the Ropes"" also turns in a sterling performance as best friend Marlon who Alfie eventually two-times.  His girlfriend Lonette played by Nia Long, star from ""Boyz 'N' the Hood,"" gives an exquisite performance with the sexy pool hall scene.  Of Alfie's other women, Jane Krakowski puts in excellent cameo appearances as Dorie, the wealthy but unsatisfied woman who gets a lot of mileage out of her limo.  She is recognizable as the lovable Elaine from the Ally McBeal series and from ""Marci X"" with Lisa Kudrow.  Sienna Miller turns in a blockbuster performance as the unstable Nikki.  From a family of actors connected with Lee Strasbourg's studio, she plays both ends against the middle as the wild but emotionally needy beauty.  Susan Sarandon turns in a touching performance as the older woman Liz who seems to win Alfie' heart, only to hand it to him on a platter.  After her Oscar in ""Dead Man Walking"" and nominations from ""Thelma & Louise,"" ""The Client,"" ""Lorenzo's Oil,"" & ""Atlantic City,"" she is one of our most recognized actresses & nails this part.  Not least of the film's attractions is the gorgeous soundtrack work of Mick Jagger & Dave Stewart with Joss Stone that is entrancing on CD.  I enjoyed the DVD deleted scenes, particularly the one where Alfie shoos the audience away.  The little German doctor was also a magnificent comic cameo.  I found ""Alfie"" to be more than just excellent cinema with attractive movie stars; it was also a moving experience about a young man growing up emotionally and realizing that the needs of others must be balanced with his own inner needs.

2203127,4,B00077BOFG,"I thought this was a really enjoyable movie. The story was impressively deep, with a touch of humor. And come on, how can you not enjoy Jude Law as an english player? And in pink...*drools*. But it was not just my love of Jude Law, that made this movie, it was the different twists and deepness to the movie the was also appealing. It's interesting to see Alfie's change in state of mind through-out the movie. The only reason, I didn't give it a 5, becasue the ending I found was left-hanging to much. And it was sad. But other wise this is a great movie, and I reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. And any Jude Law fan. ;)",1118880000,4,635,4.170731707317073
2203128,4,B00077BOFG,"Will Alfie ever learn? That's the question you will undoubtedly ask yourself ten minutes into the film, and the answer is undoubtedly yes, though it was much more thoughtful than I expected. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the end-- it seems like it ends with little resolution... then I realized that this film isn't a boy meets girl romantic comedy, that it's a character study of a womanizer and that Alfie's ultimate revelation in the end would only lead him to one person (at least for now)-- himself.

Jude Law is Alfie-- he's sexy and irrestible and will go to bed with any equally sexy and irrestible woman. He has one girl that he continuously sees (played by Marissa Tomei); she has a child whom Alfie likes, which is Alfie's first brush with emotionally attachment; he likes the girl, but hangs around for the kid. He's so suave that it's almost sickening, but when you want to hate him, you just can't. He's that good. He's so bad that he even sleeps with his best friend's girlfriend. Later in the film, when his friend has already discovered the affair, Alfie explains that he never meant to hurt anyone, to which his teary-eyed friend replies, ""But you do, Alfie.""

All in all, a pretty good movie. I didn't really like how Alfie is bombarded with crazy/awful/scary for a guy with commitment issues situations one after the other (pregnancy, prostate cancer, plus more... ugh). It's way to heavy-handed. But I still like this movie. What's not to like about Jude Law?",1117584000,5,1482,4.674329501915709

2203152,3,B00077BOFG,"I recently watched a double feature of Alfie 2005, with Jude Law in the title role, and the 1966 version of ""Alfie, with Michael Caine. I was curious to compare the two movies and was quite surprised at how well the first film holds up today, while the more recent one does not come close. Although I like Jude Law as an actor, the remake is nowhere near as effective as the original - which I highly recommend. This is not Mr Law's fault. He does an excellent job with what he is given to work with.

""Alfie"" is definitely a period piece. Jude Law operates in twenty-first century Manhattan, a glitzy, sophisticated city which has seen it all. Women's Lib has been around for decades, allowing the fairer sex to strive for equal rights in the workplace, as well as the bedroom. However, what was barely acceptable behavior in 1966 is so kaput in 2005! Are Playboy Bunnies still around? London in the mid-1960's was a swinging town - newly so - and the setting for the Michael Caine movie. Mod fashion and the mini skirt had just come into vogue, discos featured the sound of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, Sean Connery starred in the latest James Bond 007 flick, the counter culture was defining itself, the availability of medically prescribed contraceptives helped usher in the Sexual Revolution, and the liberation of women was still a ways off. Society expected women to be more submissive back then. Michael Caine's Alfie Elkins is the ultimate ladykiller, a sexual predator who objectifies females, and many of his women are, indeed, victim-like in their neediness and vulnerability. This mid-20th century playboy is still believable. And, important here, he goes about his seductions with little joy. He is primarily a hunter collecting trophies.

Jude Law is an adorable rogue as Alfie, the suave, stylish lothario. He is utterly charming, even as he ditches his adoring women, left and right. His character is more emotionally accessible, not the narcissistic, detached man who refers to one of his lovers as ""it."" Law possesses a ""joie de vivre"" which makes him less hard core, and he certainly does not come across as a misogynist - just spoiled and immature - a man who cannot commit, but who will reform and mellow with age. He grins into the camera, delighted with himself and the world. Like Caine, he too works as a chauffeur, and thus has easy access to many women. But the women Jude Law wins are not credible. This is a working class guy with a Cockney accent, and little education, who rides around on a motor scooter. He doesn't even wear a coat in the snowy winter weather. Strange, since he can afford an expensive wardrobe. Yet he is able to snap his fingers and win a veritable harem of lovely assertive ladies, all dressed to kill in designer clothes with lots of cleavage. I live in Manhattan. Women, like the ones Alfie goes home with, might bed him once as a novelty. But why date a poor, obviously callow man, who won't bring flowers, or even a dinner invitation, when one can be wined and dined by a less egotistical guy who might stick around? There are much better catches available for gorgeous femme fatales, at least in NYC - and women know it. Most of Michael Caines' women were far dowdier, more timid and from lower middle class backgrounds, like their chauffeur lover.

Director Charles Shyer's film simply lacks edge and significance in today's world. He does not explore his protagonist's darker side. The supporting cast is terrific. But again, the characters lack depth. Marisa Tomei plays Julie, a single mom Alfie feels most connected to. He is also very attached to her little boy. Sienna Miller is good as a neurotic party-girl he picks up one night at Tavern On The Green. He makes an exception to his rule, brings her back to his tiny sublet and allows her to live with him, very briefly. Nia Long is the lovely Lonette, his best friend's girl, whom Alfie seduces on a pool table. Susan Sarandon glows as the older woman with a penchant for younger men. Jude Law as Alfie is pure entertainment. The elements are there to provide viewing fun. But if it's depth you are asking for, along with dark humor, this is not the film for you. The 1966 version might be a better choice.

I am left wondering, not for the first time, why do they make remakes?

2203153,3,B00077BOFG,"The original Alfie, played darkly by a young Michael Caine, was not a nice person. He was a bounder. A user. A cad. And most of all, he was truly cruel. The film was an unsettling look at a certain type of man--and the women who fall under their spell.

This new version, starring an impossibly cute and appealing Jude Law, is just too sweet to be believed. Yes, this Alfie is a cad and a bounder too, but he's just so cute about it. You feel just like his little old lady neighbor who wants to pinch his cheek and clean his apartment. There are a few dark moments, but really I could not take it seriously for a moment and if it were not for the very real pleasure of staring at Jude Law, I could not have finished watching it.

A very big disappointment, I feel, for anyone who saw the original version with the brilliant Michael Caine.",1114905600,10,838,4.198757763975156
2203154,2,B00077BOFG,"Oh, what a powerful film the original Alfie was.  What amazing creativity, themes, and structure it had!  It was enjoyable to watch because Caine has this uncanny ability to bring you into his world.  He is so calm and ""everyday"" that Alfie's words pull you into the screen and allow you to become involved with his life.  I only wish this could have been true with this disastrous remake.  Jude Law attempts at every angle possible to bring that pizzazz that Caine brought to the screen, but ultimately fails in every attempt.  While Caine, in the original, felt like he could have represented you or I, Law in this film, feels like he is ripped from the pages of Vogue or In Style magazine.  You know that point in a magazine where you feel that the ads featuring models wearing clothes that you will never fully appreciate seem to clutter the pages instead of articles?  Well, that is exactly what this remake felt to me.  Instead of a powerful story being the central focus of the film, we were bombarded, nearly drowned, in model-esque images of the people of NYC and how only the very beautiful are attracted to the very beautiful.  Coupled with cinematography that feels like a super-budged GAP ad, I could only squint as my stomach hurled with disgust.

""What's it all about, Alfie?""  A simple question that is the central focus of the first film, while in this pathetic remake, it is never disclosed until the very end.  Why did this film suffer?  First of all, Jude Law is no Michael Caine.  He doesn't have that ""every man"" sort of appeal that dragged me into the film.  I never really felt like he was talking to me, but instead trying to maneuver his way into the mantra of the female audience.  That was a huge problem for me as well, in the original, Caine talks to the men of the audience, while in the remake, Law attempts to gain sympathy from the females in the audience.  Law just cannot seem to capture the ideals of Alfie.  He is a womanizer, I know that, but there are more layers to this character than just that.  Sadly, Law brought none of them out.  Even at the end, I never felt as if there was a final moment of realization or symbolic referencing.  ""What was it all about?""  The original, I could tell you, for this remake, it seemed a bit fuzzy and dislocated.  I don't know what it was about except a man not committed to anything glides through life with a smile somehow still located on his face.  Perhaps it wasn't just Law's work, but also the ladies that accompanied him.  These are women that the average man will never meet, or ever encounter.  So, how could we relate to the story?  Marisa Tomei, Susan Sarandon, Nia Long, and even Sienna Miller seemed to give glamorized renditions of hurt women.  The original was about Alfie, but several believe that the staples to the story were the women that surrounded him.  I can honestly say that the staples to this film were not the women, because Jude Law hailed top billing.  Did the director even see the original?

I would like to address the issue of whether this was a remake or just an ""updated"" version of the original Alfie.  My answer is that it is a remake that crashes considerably when you place the two films together.  My biggest issue with this remake was that it addressed nothing.  In the original film, it was apparent from the first 30 minutes of the movie that Alfie was a troubled man who carried trouble on his back and deposited trouble to each one of his encounters.  One might even say victims.  Was it a sign of the times or something that is inherent in the female species that lead to the destruction of so many hopes and dreams? The 60's were a time of floundering economically and politically for most of the world. Did Alfie seize on the free-sex, free love atmosphere that became prevalent during that time or were his predatory skills developed much earlier in his life? Alfie wasn't strong enough a character to go into self-destruct alone. The weakness of his character insisted that he bring everyone down with him. Just as in the animal kingdom the predator preys on the victim that is unsuspecting, most vulnerable and most importantly the victim who cannot hurt him. He must always stay insulated from the outside world.  Yet, in the remake, I saw nothing of the sort.  I saw random chaos where Hollywood regained our sympathy by making our lead character this ""can never be mad at Jude Law"".  Not living in NYC or in a place where models walk around on the streets, nor a frequent viewer of Vogue magazine, I didn't find the appeal of subtle themes of this film at all.  Alfie goes through the motions as he does in the original, but there is considerable chunk of life missing.

Overall, this was a very disappointing remake.  The music just didn't seem to carry that same charm that the original did, nor did the rest of the cast.  This was not an art film, but instead a Hollywood creation that lacked the appeal of the original.  It was created to boost some sex appeal for Jude Law instead of showing this radical vision of our world.  Alfie is genuine in the original, and quite plastic in this remake, which ultimately hurt the overall impression of the film.  Those that say that you cannot compare the original and this remake together because they are two separate films, I would completely disagree with.  This Alfie was a remake and was poorly put together while the original was, ""powerful, humorous, yet pointed story"".

Grade: ** out of *****",1114646400,11,5483,4.545918367346939
2203155,3,B00077BOFG,"This movie reminds me of a certain popular Manhattan-based HBO series, except with a male Carrie Bradshaw as the leading character.  Alfie (Jude Law) pursues a wild lifestyle of amorous pursuits, designer shoes and clothes, and a burning need to share his life with us, the viewing public.

In his casual romps, he of course becomes more like Samantha Jones, but the morality of Charlotte and the wit of Miranda is sadly lacking.

When you get right down to it, there's really nothing to like about Alfie's character, and you have to give Jude Law his props for being so realistically empty, yet undeniably charming with his killer smile.

Although the female characters, with one notable exception, are supposed to be the underdogs, most of them come off stronger, tougher and smarter than Alfie, even after he loves them and leaves them.  Nia Long is wonderful as Lonette, and her resemblance to Angela Bassett was extraordinary.  There's a scene when she's dancing to the music of a jukebox, and I swear my mind flashed to Angela's role as Tina Turner.

Marisa Tomei plays the role of Julie, a sweet single mother, who is the closest thing to a main squeeze Alfie's ever had, and Susan Sarandon neatly steals the rest of the movie as the sexiest over forty Alfie's ever seen.

The main story has moved out of London for this tepid remake, and although the era has been updated to Prada in Manhattan, parts of the movie seem old and dated, especially the hair, makeup and apparel.

A weak story to start with, it ends somewhat abruptly, with dangling ends flying all over the place.  Alfie's a mess, plain and simple, but the performances of Law, Long, Tomei and Sarandon bring it up to a respectable, but not outstanding, three stars.

2203156,4,B00077BOFG,"I was in the mood for a ""light"" movie after watching mostly depressing dramas the last few weeks, so on a recent trip to the video store I picked up Alfie. I had seen the original version with Michael Caine and liked it very much so my expectations going in were pretty low.

I was into it by the time Alfie (Law) had dressed himself and duped his poor neighbor to clean his house while he was away. I have always believed Jude Law was talented, but his performance made the film. He oozed charisma, charm, and wit. He played a role that essentially is self absorbed, but he makes him likeable, even when you despise what he is doing.

I also enjoyed the tone of the film. This is not a campaign to show the swinging lives of good looking men in the modern age. Rather, it works as a mechanism against bachelorhood, and shows the glimpses of content ness and fulfillment when you meet someone special. The cinematography is something that should be noticed. Observe how the director is using colors to depict the state of Alfie, subtle at times, but very effective.

Finally, I was blown away by Sienna Miller, and what a beautiful girl she is. It's hard to believe that she's British because her American accent is one of the best that I have heard on film in quite some time.",1112140800,4,1277,4.4025423728813555
2203157,5,B00077BOFG,"I haven't seen the original ALFIE since I was a kid, and so I won't compare this to the original. The only reason I rented this is because I dig Jude Law. He gave some great performances in THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY,the underrated sci fi art film A.I. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, THE ROAD TO PERDITION, and COLD MOUNTAIN. In ALFIE Jude Law is damn near perfect. He deserved a Best Actor nomination for this film. ""F"" Chris Rock. What a phenomenal actor this guy is.

I can understand why there are bad reviews for this movie. It's not your typical lowbrow Hollywood comedy. After the first hour and especially at the end, I came to realize this for what it was: a deeply emotional art film. That's right, AN ART FILM. (See the definition below.) It's such a bad word to the general movie going population. Most people don't like art films. Especially Americans. Which is why a lot of people hated this and another recent art film, LOST IN TRANSLATION. Most people just want to be entertained. Me, I love the art of film and I like to be moved. I was very moved by ALFIE and it's one of the very best films of 2004.

WARNING: THERE'S A MAJOR SPOILER HERE FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T GET IT. At the beginning Alfie talks to the camera laying down the rules for the single carefree swinger as he moves from one female conquest to another. Very funny stuff. When Alfie discovers a lump on his genitals turns out to be benign, he starts to reevaluate his life. But not enough has changed about Alfie until he realizes he is losing friends and women. Towards the end of the film I wanted Alfie to find the girl of his dreams because he's charming and he's beginning to change. BY THE VERY END OF THIS FILM, after losing everyone, Alfie meets a girl that he had stopped calling. The audience's expectation is that he'll get this girl back and live happily ever after. Instead, she rejects him. As she's walking away, Alfie stops her and apologizes. After she's gone, Alfie turns to the camera and makes a speech about never reciprocating the things all the women in his life have given him. Then he pontificates about having everything he needs except ""piece of mind"". Alfie pauses, then says, ""What's it all about?,"" and walks off into the night. If you pay attention, Alfie should have replaced that one simple phrase ""piece of mind"" with ""love."" Alfie is learning, but he's not quite there yet. Getting the girl in the end would have been the easy way out of this film and a typical Hollywood schlock ending. I can just see the Studio heads arguing that the ending is unsatisfying to audiences. (Later I discovered the filmmakers did have a problem selling the ending.) I'm so glad this film ended the way it did. Against my expectations. BRILLIANT WRITING. This kind of SMART moviemaking restores my faith in the Hollywood system. I figured most of the movie going public was smarter, until reading some of the negative reviews, mostly from people who said, ""I don't get it. 'What's it all about?'"" The people who didn't get it are just like Alfie. IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE. And paying the consequences for your actions. What's life without love? YOU CAN'T GET AND RECEIVE LOVE WITHOUT GIVING IT IN RETURN. Alfie almost spells it out for himself and the audience. But the filmmakers require you to make that one small leap that Alfie can't quite make for himself. I got the feeling that eventually Alfie would learn this and find love. WHAT A WONDERFUL FILM. (I guess I have to provide a definition for the smart reviewer above who says this is NOT an ART FILM. Unless you care, skip the next paragraph.)

AMBIGUITY IN AN ART FILM- Because art films do not always have to explain themselves, they will often have episodic plots or wandering episodes, where a character might wander off, encounter something, do something, or say something for no clear reason, and no definite explanation will ever be provided in the film. Instead, things remain ambiguous to the very end. This presents a challenge to most viewers who are accustomed to the classical style, because loose ends are not all tied up in the final scene of the art film, as opposed to classical Hollywood films which have strong closure. Art film is less about pure escapist entertainment compared with the classical system, also adding to the challenge for the viewer. THIS FILM IS NOT A PURE EXAMPLE OF THE GENRE. But the ending qualifies it as such by these terms.

Also includes a great soundtrack by Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart and some of the most beautiful photography I've ever seen of New York City.

2203158,2,B00077BOFG,"In 1966, Michael Caine as Alfie was asked: What's it all about?  Charles Shyer's ALFIE (Paramount) begs another question: Why was the classic 60's film about the fundamental emptiness of the sexual revolutin remade?  No longer set in swinging London, the new version still features a glib Brit who talks to the camera. He's still on the make, but here transported to contemporary New York.

Not particularly witty, clever or insightful, this great-looking film has nothing new to say but says it anyway.  The ubiquitous Jude Law is fine in the Michael Caine part and Marisa Tomei, Nia Long, Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon are convincing as the manipulated and manipulative women in his life.

I noticed writer director Shyer's name is printed at least ten times on the DVD box. That must be some kind of record.  Maybe that's why this movie was remade.",1111708800,11,854,4.855172413793103

Very well directed, and a wonderful soundtrack from Mick Jagger, and some Joss Stone.",1111449600,5,354,4.67741935483871
2203160,3,B00077BOFG,"The decision to remake ""Alfie"" was an interesting choice.  When Michael Caine essayed the role in 1966 the sexual revolution was about to get into high gear and the assumption was that most women you picked up for a one-night stand were on the pill.  But when Jude Law plays the title character in 2004 what is in the back of the mind of anybody sleeping with someone for the first time is that you are not only having sex with them but with all of their partners as well.  Today a lothario like Alfie needs a lot more than good looks and a Cockney accent: they need documented proof of their latest AIDS test.  But director Charles Shyer (""Baby Boom,"" ""Father of the Bride"") and his co-scripter Elaine Pope (""Murphy Brown,"" ""Seinfeld"") forget that pertinent reality about today's singles scene even if they have turned Alfie's conquests into the more sophisticated women of contemporary society.

The problem with ""Alfie"" is that while we are predisposed to like the title character, especially when Jude Law wants to be charming, this is not a sympathetic character.  In this film we see that Alfie's life is but a joke, and he is the last one in on it (and even then, we are not sure that he gets what it is all about).  One by one, all of Alfie's relationships go sour.  There is Julie (Marisa Tomei), the single mother with the great kid who thinks Alfie should be faithful to her, Dorie (Jane Krakowski), a married woman looking for fun, Nikki (Sienna Miller), the sexy model who comes into his life, Liz (Susan Sarandon), the mature business woman who would not mind using Alfie's services as more than a limo drive, and Lonette (Nia Long), the girlfriend of Alfie's best friend Marlon (Omar Epps).

It could be argued that ""Alfie"" is intended as a cautionary tale, but since it is hard for us to see ourselves in the character it is easy to dismiss any intended lesson as being for somebody else.  I do not find Alfie's antics comic, but rather sad, especially since he should be on the same page with the rest of us a lot earlier in this film.  For most of this film I was unengaged and disinterested in the character and his problems.  The most ironic point in the film comes when Liz tells Alfie she has found someone younger, which is strange given Alfie's lack of maturity.  There are certainly enough extras on this DVD to suggest that those involved think they are involved in making some sort of significant statement in offering this remake, but I am still not buying.",1111190400,7,2485,4.544843049327354
2203161,3,B00077BOFG,"I'll try to give a brief opinion of the film itself and the features, just to balance things out. ""Alfie"" is supposed to be a remake; taking the old 1960s movie and transplanting it and the characters into a modern setting. So of course that means it has to go from a London/England setting to the overused Manhattan/New York scene. The women thankfully get an upgrade from how they were portrayed in the first movie to make them stronger characters that fit into today's society.

Charles Shyer, the director, makes it a point to make sure that the audience knows this is supposed to be a modern remake. Yet, through the commentary and espescially the ""Round Table Discussion"" feature, you can tell that he attempted to work within what had been done in the old film and simply updated a character or plot twist here or there. This makes for a rather average if not flat plot, in my opinion. There are scenes that make the film look as if it's taking place in the 60s with the art direction. Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart provide the music, providing for an older sound that distances it from now and puts it decades back.

I don't fault Jude Law or any of the actors for the outcome of the film. Law and espescially Susan Sarandon carry the film with their performances. The script and direction appear to be at fault here. While updating the characters, Shyer seemed to lose what made the first film work. We have no idea why this Alfie came to the United States. This is a rather big plot hole since the original took place in England and featured Michael Cane, an English actor. Why did this Alfie move to the U.S. and what's his story? It's sort of baffling to be faced with this character who obviously is a bit out of place compared to all the others featured in the movie.

As a viewer, I was left with a lot of questions. Who were all these women? They just seem to come around, then they are replaced by another. By the end, the director seems to want you to feel sorry for Alfie but really, you're left a bit confused and let down. There's a lot of potential that is just not handled well. So my biggest complaint really is about the film itself and the plot. The acting is good all around, considering what they had to work with.

As for the special features (there was a sticker on my copy boasting that there are over 4 hours of bonus features), the ""Round Table-Intimate discussion"" was not necessary. There was hardly anything intimate about it. The creative people discuss the creation of signs in the movie, locations they shot at, what they thought of the script. Shyer sort of sits there and asks the questions while the others seem to hesitate and find good things to say about the film. ""The Women of Alfie"" is perhaps the best feature, making a comparison in between the women of the original movie and how they were updated for this film. ""Let the Music In"" was rather boring. Jagger and Stewart talk about songs, footage of them in the studio is shown as Jagger works through a few songs. The deleted scenes should have all been worked into the movie. They explain a lot of the plot holes and the commentary that you can have playing during them says a lot about why they were cut; just for time. The producers had no real reason to cut them. They were good transitions and little segments that either gave more insight into Alfie or one of the other characters.

This film was okay. It wasn't impressive or ground breaking but it was a nice Jude Law or Susan Sarandon film. I wouldn't have bought it right away; perhaps for a cheaper price, yes, but nothing to scramble to see.",1110931200,9,3603,4.444780635400908
2203162,1,B00077BOFG,"It takes a lot of work to make Jude Law boring, and this film pulls it off.  He's empty and brainless as Alfie, all words and no edge.  The move to New York, though he's dressed in 60s styles, seems ridiculous, especially when he says New York has the most beautiful women in the world.  I grew up there, but I've also been to Paris and other European cities and hearing that line made me guffaw and think: There goes reality!  I gave up despite the sizzling Nia Long, who stole every scene she was in.  Law kept feeling to me like he was pouring on the technique, following the director's vision of the character rather than his own.  A real misfire from this actor.",1110931200,13,667,4.296

2203164,5,B00077BOFG,"A great movie. Jude protrays alfie really well. very cad, sexy, charming, and a looser at the same time. the music is great too. The movie provokes lessons about relationships. And boy does this society fail when it comes to that. This movie has lessons to be learned. Jude law protrays alfie as a confused man, playing the field,, who you think has learned valuable lessons about life.. but just doesn't want to accept it. So while at times you hate him , you feel bad for him. I think it's because deep down inside he's just a human being. Not a evil character but a foolish one. Very charming on the outside but totally clue less on the inside. He gets warning signs after each breakdown but is unwilling to accept that he is not happy. so whatever is learned goes from one ear and out the other. He thinks he has all the right answers. He tells those thoughts to the audience,, and boy do you shake your head. He has a whole definition on life and women all backwards. And i personally know a few people like that. And for those who think this is unrealistic of any person they know,, i think u should open your eyes.

One other thing i found intelligent about this movie, is that it showed everything beautifull sorrounding Alfie. Heck , he thought he was all perfect. Temptations, beauty , and having a jolly old time is not what its all about.. This movie has its appeal to being sexy, and modern.. But it wonderfully shows Alfie falling apart.

And it leaves the audience to ask themselves what life is about.

2203168,4,B00077BOFG,"The fall of 2004 is the year of Jude Law, and this is only movie three. After ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" and ""I Heart Huckabees,"" we are able to see a darker side of his acting with ""Alfie,"" which is actually miss billed. If you watch the trailers and television ads for ""Alfie,"" you would think that it is a light romantic comedy, but it is anything but. Alfie has a very dark side to him, and this movie leans towards a darker side about thirty minutes in, and that's when Alfie becomes such a complicated character to play. It seems that Alfie has the perfect life, until one moment when he is only followed by bad luck, and his entire life begins to unravel. ""Alfie"" is a remake of movie that I never saw, a movie with Michael Caine, and I'm sure that the original is much better, but this movie is really worth checking out. I was never bored by this movie, and Jude Law did give another great preformance. About 80% of the movie is actually told from the point of view of Alfie, as he speaks to us from the camera. He is always telling us what he does, what kind of life he leads, and how he feels about certain things, and at sometimes it's almost as if he is convincing us, and himself, that what is doing is ok.

At the beginning of ""Alfie,"" we meet Alfie and it seems that he leads the perfect life. He is the kind of guy who is never with a women for a very long time, and after he uses them for what he wants, he never calls, or makes up some kind of story to never see them again. He is trying to tell guys that he could get whatever he wants, and he tries to tell the girls that he is preforming a service for them, because he helps them get back on track if they are unhappy, or something like that. He is a limo driver, who drives his customers to their location, and then he has sex with them in the backseat. His personal life is being with as many women as possible, but his work life is him and his friend Marlon wanting to buy the limo business from Mr. Wing. While he does have many women, he has a half-girlfriend in the from of Julie, but she is a single mother, and to Alfie that comes with ""baggage."" The trouble begins after he has a one night stand with Marlon's girlfriend, who broke up with him the night before. He can't get it out of his head, especially after she gets pregnant. He then goes to the doctor, and he finds something startling, that leads Alfie to want to change his life. Of course, he doesn't, and begins to ""date"" Nikki, who is a depressed drug addict, and the older woman Liz, who also gives him something to think about. As Alfie begins to realize that he is hurting people, even though he doesn't mean to, and he starts to question life, and what it is all about.

I don't think that I gave to much of the plot away, but to only describe the basic plot wouldn't be appealing. The commericals don't show any of the darker side to Alfie's life, and that was what made the character so interesting. You always wanted to know what would happen next. The final monologue at the end is brilliant, and I wanted more. Alfie is always trying to convince people that he is a good guy, until finally he realizes that what he is doing is not right, and he is always hurting these people. He reminded me of Jack Nicolson is last year's ""Something's Gotta Give,"" but he finally gave these women closure. Alfie just meets you, sleeps with you, and then leaves you. I don't think I'm ruining anything by telling you what he realizes, because I'm not telling you HOW he realizes everything, which made ""Alfie"" a modern day Greek tradegy. It's a shame this didn't make that much in theatres, but it's still out, so you should check it out.

ENJOY!

Then, one by one, bad things start happening.  Bit by bit, Alfie starts waking up, realizing that he's been a taker, not a giver, yet he has nothing.

The strange thing is that in real life, this would never happen.  Guys like this are sociopaths, with no concern for anyone but themselves.  Therefore, he would just find new women to use when the old ones refused to play his game or disappeared from his life.

8045376,3,B00077BOFG,"I put off watching this, knowing this was not going to be a satisfactory movie, but in an indecisive moment, decided to see ""What's Up, Alfie?""

On the  positive side, Alfie narrates his own story, looking right into the camera, even sometimes while engaged with a current girlfriend .  There are no great speeches, but it was a good way to develop some affection for and knowledge of the main character.

A young  boy/man who  has a  loving, interested,  empathic mother who will treat her son like a real human being and help him realize his talents and maybe an inspiring purpose or two, will respect women, and treat them with interest, and care.  But Alfie is  one of those young men about whom we know was abandoned in one way or another, so when the sexual hormones grow strong, women are seen only as sexual exploits.
He is unable to form or even envision a caring, two way, responsive relationship.  So the story is how he attracts, gets active with, then abandons variously beautiful women, because he doesn't know what to do after the initial attraction and ""success.""

The turning point was almost missable:  one of his seductions apparently resulted in a pregnancy.  He was shocked, but helps her in any way he can.  She decides to have an abortion, but  doesn't  disclose to him she changed her mind.  At that point, he exits to next girlfriend, and doesn't see the prior one again until nearly the film's end.  Next, he is turned down by a lover, who is a lot like him emotionally;  under demand she  tells him she's found  a newer, younger lover.  Her face reveals the vacuousness and unimportance of this excuse, for though she is an older woman, she's just as superficial and empty as Alfie.

These two things get him questioning himself, and with  the help of an older man who befriended him,  acting as an empathic ear,  who then tells him both what he did right, and what wrong, and asks what he's going to do with the rest of his life!  A long monologue, questioning and searching results, ending with a smile and the supposition he might be able to change!

What dates the movie for me is that it shows all these beautiful, talented and able women, mostly warm and loving, as victims of his charm.  But
any woman who grows up knowing or being in touch with  her real needs will know that trust is essential in a relationship, especially when sex is involved, and would avoid ""charm"" as a trustable feature in a man.  There will always be some conflicts in a relationship, so both parties have to be willing to look at those from both sides, which isn't available without trust.

So, the ending wasn't really satisfying, but it was an ending to that particular story of Alfie and how he hurt so many women so carelessly.",1522540800,,2742,4.541922290388548
8045377,2,B00077BOFG,"Review of Alfie
Hot Toasty Rag, December 8, 2017

If you grew up idolizing Michael Caine in 1966s Alfie, or have already seen that version before the remake was released, you probably won't like the 2004 version. If you belong the modern generation and have never seen the original Alfie, you won't really be that phased by the remake. Theres a very simple reason why the remake didn't work: the story isn't shocking anymore.

Back in the sixties, a man who slept around with countless women and didn't commit to any of them was a cad. If he got a girl pregnant and refused to marry her, he was despicable. Nowadays, that type of behavior is normal. Men and women have casual sex without a second thought, and pregnancy isn't the drastic life-changer it used to be. Abortions are more readily available and less taboo and scary, so if a girl is faced with the prospect of being an unwed mother, it just doesnt have the same dramatic pull as it did in 1966.

There are countless films in this modern era that showcase, if not glorify, a mans collection of bedroom partners. In 1966, Alfie was revolutionary and instantly made Michael Caine a household name. The remake just isn't the same, despite the filmmakers attempt to shock audiences by including an interracial relationship.

That being said, if you like Jude Law, theres nothing wrong with his performance, and he does look awfully handsome in this movie. If you're in the mood for a light comedywith a couple of scenes that attempt to be dramaticwith lots of good-looking people sleeping together, you can rent Alfie. Just don't expect it to stick with you like the original did.
