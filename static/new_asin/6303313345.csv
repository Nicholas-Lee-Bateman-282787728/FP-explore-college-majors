626148,1,6303313345,"Not since Sally Field's flight from a pack of stereotypically vicious and stupid Iranian fundamentalists in ""Not Without My Daughter"" has an American film painted such a closed-minded picture of Middle-Eastern  people.  The Arabs or Persians portrayed in this movie (we're never  actually told exactly _what_ they are--the art being smuggled is Persian,  but the terrorists are referred to as Arabs) have no identifiable redeeming  qualities other than that they're apparently quite adept at theiving  massive works of art and waging war on us Americans.  This film is yet  another exploitation of the transfer of American fear and anger from the  Commie Russians to the Insane Muslims in the post-cold war period.  They  didn't even make a half-hearted attempt to soften the blow to Arab/Persian  cultures by casting an actor of Middle-Eastern heritage on the ""good  guy"" side.  Alas, the star power of Arnie will be too much to dissuade  anyone from viewing this movie.",921110400,5,971,5.174193548387096

626211,4,6303313345,"Another great movie for Arnold. I have no idea why American shuns Arnold and Tom Cruise. They keep churning out the great ones. And we all seem to take them for granted. Sad.

Man secretly works for the CIA> His wife is bored but doesn't know her husband lives such an adventurous life on the side. Their daughter is a troubled teen as she doesn't know her parents. AND the dad doesn't know that his wife and daughter feel they way that they do. Then by accident he has the chance to create a fake situation to add some excitement for the wife. But it turns into a real dangerous situation. The daughter is kidnapped as well. The dad is exposed as he tries to save his family.

I can remember watching this in the theatre. I loved the seen when Jamie Lee Curtis shows up at the hotel and transforms in the hallway. The french guy's accent. The music. The dance. It was just pure fun. The late Bill Paxton did a great job of course. It was just a fun movie I thought.",1515283200,,966,4.216216216216216
626212,5,6303313345,"Described by movie reviewers as fast, flashy, furious and fun, ""TRUE LIES"" is a truly spectacular action-adventure, spy-thriller, romantic comedy!  It's at the top of any Schwarzenegger fan's best movies.  Brilliantly scripted and directed by James Cameron, with a vibrant musical score by Brad Fiedel, and supported by a sexy Jamie Lee Curtis, a motor-mouth Tom Arnold, and a cast of intriguing characters; the exhilarating action is non-stop and unequalled.  In addition to one of the most incredible chase scenes ever filmed, is one breathtaking mid-air scene in which secret agent Harry Tasker (Schwarzenegger) is trying to rescue his daughter from a group of bug-eyed terrorists while flying a Harrier jet and totally demolishing their operation. This was preceded by a terrifying helicopter rescue attempt to save his wife (Jamie Lee) who is trapped in an out-of-control limousine speeding toward a fiery destruction atop a blown-out bridge. There's also a cool comedic sub-plot and one seductive ""stripper"" scene which alone is worth the price of admission, and that's no lie.  But WHY are Arny's movies so universally popular?  Aside from being top-notch productions by major studios and directors, people are attracted to the ex-bodybuilder for different reasons.  To men, he represents the physical ideal. To women, he represents the clean-cut and moral masculine male.  And to kids, Arnold represents the real-life superhero.  So it's easy to overlook the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a very bright and talented deadpan comic with a great sense of humor.  And as a successful yet underrated actor, he can handle serious roles with equal impact.  Even playing the role of Governor was ""no problemo"" :)",1515110400,,1717,5.302583025830258

626217,4,6303313345,"This movie ""True Lies"" from 1994 is the last movie I would watch with Arnold Schwarzene1994, and it's a good movie. When this movie came out in 1994, I started to know who Arnold Schwarzenegger was, and thought he would be a good actor. I remember clearly the first movie I saw with him was ""Commando 1"", and I don't find that was good movie. There's a fight scene from that movie with Arnold that I don't like, so that's one of his movies I wouldn't watch, out of all the movies he's ever done. And that movie ""Commando 1"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger came out years before this movie ""True Lies"".

And again I do find this movie ""True Lies"" is good. I find Arnold really played a much better role. It also stars Jamie Lee Curtis as his wife, and I also find she played a good role. This movie is also really action and the fight scenes with Arnold are pretty good. There's three other movies with Arnold that I do like and that came out years before this movie ""True Lies"" though, other than the one I mentioned.

Other movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger I would watch is

""The Terminator""
""Kindergarden Cop""
""Terminator 2"" (Judgment Day)

These are three other good movies I would watch with Arnold Schwarzenegger, before wathing this movie ""True Lies"".",1512086400,,1253,4.530973451327434

This DVD could have been better. It says it's 2.35:1 Widescreen format, which it is. However when playing the movie, it is matted on the top and bottom as well as the sides. If I could zoom in, the quality would be even worse.

This is one I come back to over and over again because of the humour, the strong character played by Jamie Lee Curtis, and the amusing interplay between her character and that of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  This is the story of a secret agent, his wife's discovery of his role, and the clash when his work life and his home life collide.  Arnold's character is solid, but doesn't really change much throughout the movie.  However, it is a joy to watch Jamie Lee Curtis' character blossom from a woman flirting with danger because she is bored with her home life and her work life, to a strong asset in her own right.  She stands up for herself throughout, and I always love watching her character.",1481846400,5,784,4.611510791366906

626491,5,6303313345,"I just saw this video for the first time in years. I saw it on an old VHS I'd taped from cable decades ago. The movie really was incredible. it had fantastic locations that I hung out at (Still Do) all of the time. The epic fight scene at the Georgetown Park Mall (Since Refurbished) is a classic. The mall never looked better than it did in the 1990s! The chase scene at 14th & K Street through the park was and is a classic in DC spy movies.

The terrorist group called Crimson Jihad had a really corny name. And I find it highly unlikely even pre 9-11 that American intelligence services would be so blind as to allow an international terrorist group to smuggle three or four nuclear bombs onto American soil! Not to mention a small army that Arnold disposes of all by himself! Come on here! Even Bin Laden & Abu Nidal never achieved that (Thank God)! From the opening shot of the film to the end where a future president to be steals his line ""You're fired!"", more than 50 men are slaughtered by Arnold Schwarzanegger. The character he plays shows no mercy to anyone who stands in his way. He psychologically abuses his wife and humiliates a poor used car salesman (Played Wonderfully By Bill Paxton) almost to death.

But despite these glaring weaknesses I loved the movie. I saw it in theaters when it was originally released and couldn't get enough of it. I so wish that they would do a sequel to this fine film. All of the principals are still alive and working in Hollywood (Although Grant Heslov Is Now A Producer). Elisha Dushku herself is a fine star! Maybe she followed in her Father's footsteps and became a brutal killer in her own right! I'm the 192nd person to rate this as Five Stars (Four And A Half) and the 547th overall to rate it. Buy it on DVD and you won't be disappointed. Yes, the DVD might not be perfect for modern TVs, but it's better than nothing let me tell you that.

One more thing. I truly loved the villainess played by Tia Carrere! I hated to see her demise...or was it? She might have survived the plunge into the Atlantic and hung on for dear life by the pontoon. Perhaps she waited decades plotting revenge on Harry's wife and family. Perhaps she left the country hoping to escape the federal authorities only to run afoul of Harry in the future. Or perhaps she was arrested and did 20 years' time for conspiring with terrorists and was given an opportunity to redeem herself by telling the FBI and CIA where the other terrorist cells were in and out of the country. The possibilities are endless. Mr. Cameron, please bring back Juno Skinner! Tia was absolutely incredible!

626718,1,6303313345,"This is by far the worst quality professionally released DVD I've ever seen.  It looks like it was shot with a VCR camcorder in 1989.  The visible picture on my HDTV is half sized so I went into my TV options to stretch the picture to fit wide screen (I never had to do this with any other DVD before by the way.)  While I was able to fit the picture onto my screen it just pulled the image apart making it look even worse. Also by stretching the picture, the closed captions get cut off, so I'm screwed either way.

Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY this DVD.  I have bought movies off those guys in the street that film it from their seat in the theater and you can expect that kind of quality from this disc, no joke.  I'm not blaming the seller instead the blame lies with 20th Century Fox or whoever released this trash.  What a waste of time and money.",1469232000,,859,4.0773809523809526

626758,4,6303313345,"I saw True Lies at a theater with a friend.  The movie itself is overall very good and quite funny as well as having some good action scenes.  That said, the movie has quite a bit of sexually related or inappropriate references.  There is even a quasi pole dance scene in the movie.  Between some of the language of other inappropriate talk or scenes, the movie is not something I can watch in good conscience as a follow of Yeshua the Messiah.

The movie starts off strong with a good action scene and beautiful scenery at that.  In my opinion and the opinion of my friend that saw the movie with me, the movie detoured for a while with the wife and some of the hard to believe or cheesy things that took place.  I don't think the movie ever fully recovered, but it did get better.  Overall, I would say the movie is 3.5 or 3.75 stars out of 5, probably not 4 starts, but better than 3 stars.

The DVD itself was Widescreen (which I prefer) and the quality was very good (for its time), but the DVD was unspectacular as far as extras or bonus features.  It had some subtitle options, original trailer, etc.",1464307200,,1107,4.304347826086956

626997,5,6303313345,"Funny story about the first time I saw True Lies: I was in the Army in 1994, and we were out in the desert near Barstow, CA for training. We finally got some time off and decided to go to the post theater and see this movie. The theater was packed with soldiers who had spent the last few days jumping through the Army's endless hoops of inspecting vehicles so we could sign them out and take them out in the desert for training. When Arnold steals a flabbergasted Marine's Harrier jet, and the Marine stammers ""sir, you're going to need to sign for this aircraft!"" There could not have been a more perfect audience for that joke. The theater erupted with laughter and it didn't die down for over a minute. It was nice to see the military's bureaucratic red tape mocked in a new movie, after all of us had been forced to endure it in the burning desert for several days.

Anyway, I did greatly enjoy this movie. Lots of great scenes, every character was entertaining to watch, even the sleazy car salesman Simon. The climax with the Harrier jet, the bridge, and the way the terrorist dies was all fun to watch. Too bad it's unlikely there will ever be a sequel, because James Cameron thinks it would be inappropriate in a post-9/11 world.",1435449600,,1238,4.4298245614035086

627493,1,6303313345,"Went to amazon looking for comments about the poor DVD transfer of True Lies, which it really is. Got intrigued by the one star reviews of sexism and racism (some on-line too) and tried to figure out why I like this movie.

First of all, it is so clearly an unreal spoof. I can't understand the vituperative comments about sexism and racism except from the POV of people who think movies have way more influence than they ought to, although I do acknowledge, with some people they do. This movie is so clearly not reality, and Cameron has gone out of his way to make that rather obvious in so many deliberately ridiculous silly scenes, so to criticize it like it has an influence over our values and morality and behaviour makes it sound like those critics don't have much respect for people and their self-determination and regard most of us as rather weak-minded and not very perceptive. Sigh. Okay.

Picking apart certain scenes on an isolated micro-level and ignoring the larger context is the fallacy that almost all critics make, from journalism to academia, for the sum of the parts can change the meaning of the whole. When I started to think of this film within its whole context it became even more fascinating.

Jamie Lee Curtis's part, and she herself, as well as Schwarzenegger, have been criticized for being degrading to women. In a larger context though, the film is about her evolution and as a whole charts the emancipation of women. She starts as a June Cleaver caricature, the dutiful, adoring and somewhat blind and ignorant wife to a more worldly dominant man. But she is bored to death with that role and seeks to break out. Initially she does that in the direction of having an affair. Then she realizes that is empty and she seeks a bigger more significant fulfillment. She takes on a mission. As in history, that is still first guided and overly controlled by men. She is locked in the little concrete room. Men put her there. Women in history helped get themselves there and keep themselves there too. By the end of the interrogation there though, she realizes, as have women in history, that she wants to be true to fixing her boredom and her need to care, and also she ""needed to feel alive,"" in a world and a marriage where she felt taken for granted and was... and also allowed herself to be for 15 years. But no more. What ensues is a conversation all spouses should have with each other through a relationship, albeit face to face, and too few do: how to continue to be fulfilled and find meaning. Then she more or less smashes her way out of her prison, physically and psychologically.

After that we witness her liberation: the tentative first steps going to the hotel room, stumbling on the way (and note the previous scenes: the reality of the dirt under her finger nails, the ripping away of all the stupid frills on her dress). In the room again she is tempted to be what the man wants, realizes it's ridiculous and degrading, then the absolute defiance and refusal to be what men define and demand, and to be accepted on her own merit in her own way, learning along the way. Isn't that what we all want and do? The world gets in the way from time to time, but by the end of the film clearly she and her husband embark on missions as equals, and her, apparently, without all the training he must have had, she is just a natural at it. They are now more or less equal, and clearly better more passionate partners (the tango).

The anti-Arab criticism of this film is similar hogwash. Most of it comes from pre-9/11, but even after, the fact is, in the world some Arabs are villains sometimes. If you listen to the BBC news, barely a day goes by where there is not a suicide bombing somewhere in the middle east. Sometimes others are villainous. Personally I would like to see more good news stories about the majority of Arabs and Muslims, but why it works this way is another essay.  This is a film. This is a particular film and needed a particular context. Clearly caricatured. Clearly a parody. It is more about fanaticism. Try and get it. Try and get over righteous indignation.

Sometimes there are universal themes and symbols, sometimes not. So I post this review under the one star section not because it is a one star film, far from it, but that's where it needs to be read. True Lies is humorous, symbolic, perhaps inspiring us to learn something, if we have the eyes to see, and entertaining all along the way. The DVD transfer though is truly a one star thing, so far.",1391990400,6,4519,4.523867809057528

They also have a rebellious young teenage daughter, Dana (Eliza Dushku). Helen is so bored with her life and Harry's descriptions of `another day at the office' that she embarks, almost by accident, on an `affair' with a used car salesman Simon (Bill Paxton). Harry overhears Helen and Simon setting up an assignation, so he brings the full resources of the Secret Service down on them to track their movements. However, Simon is trying to have his way with Helen by pretending to be a spy himself. So Harry drops in on their assignation and takes them both away for `interrogation'. As part of his undercover work Harry charms an Arab agent, Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere) who works for an Arab terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik).

This nearly twenty year old film epitomizes the basis for his continuing success. He and the people he has trusted to do the job, have created an image which he can get into and create an aura of power, while all about him carry the acting roles. That's not a knock; it takes skill to build on little native skill for a job and grow into it to a degree which allows the multitudes of many nations to  buy into the imagery.
This is just another entertaining, on the whole, humorous outing where Mr. S. soars above the crowd of ordinary mortals, giving us an image of invincibility and over-all mastery of men and women. Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job as Carol Burnett doing a skit with Harvey Korman as her husband (played by A.S.), Tom Arnold as his chief assisting Federal agent is just fine, while the remainder of the cast do their job of supporting the Big Man.

With a great cast that seem to just work together perfectly Arnold playing Harry the work obsessed secret agent man who is clueless when it comes to his family. Jamie Lee Curtis playing Arnold's wife who is attention starved and looking for some adventure. Tom Arnold playing the funny sidekick to Harry. Then Bill Paxton who is a spineless used car salesman who lies to women to get them into bed, who just so happened to lie to Harry's wife adding one more issue to Harry's already growing list of problems.

This film has absolutely no shortage of humor or action and frequently switches from an action scene to a humor line. Like when Harry steals a USMC AV-8B Harrier and his partner is telling the Marine that he'll sign for it and that its like riding a bike and you never forget how to use one, at the same time Harry is crushing a cop car with the front gear as he struggles to get it off the ground. Or when Curtis finds out who her husband really is and sees him disarm a few guys she utters the words ""my god i married Rambo"". The film has plenty of one liners like that which will get you to chuckle and then laugh uncontrollably.

This film has a plot that i will not explain due to not wanting to ruin it for people who are planning on watching it. It is a film you'll enjoy watching many times over.

627853,4,6303313345,"That's Arnold's horrified wife Jamie Lee asking the question,just after it is revealed her husband had been leading a double life as a secret agent. True Lies(released July/94)is a wonderful action romp starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,Jamie Lee Curtis,Tom Arnold,Bill Paxton and Tia Carrere. If there ever was a ""guys movie"" this would certainly classify as one and Jamie Lee's considerable ""assets"" are shown off to great advantage.
The story involves one Harry Tasker(Schwarzenegger) who is a secret agent for the Omega Sector. The film opens as he and his partner Albert(Arnold)are crashing a dinner party at an expensive palatial estate in Switzerland:Arnold listens in electronically with orders and Harry does the walking. Harry meets up one Juno(Tia Carrere),supposedly an antiquities dealer specializing in Persian artifacts,based in Italy. She is actually a front for a terrorist organization called the Crimson Jihad,who are on a mission to obtain nuclear weapons for use against the U.S.Harry is found out and is chased away by the armed guards and just barely escapes.
Harry revisits Juno in her establishment in Italy to reconnoiter the place. The Jihadists are worried that their cover will be blown and they chase Harry through a local mall,but loose him. In the meantime Harry's bespectacled and plain looking wife Helen(Curtis)is leading a boring life. Harry,her ""salesman"" husband,spends more time away than with her and their daughter. She is spotted in a restaurant one day by a local car salesman called Simon(Paxton)who is on the make for women just like her looking for a ""thrill"" in their lives. Coincidentally,to pick up women,he uses a story that he is a secret agent being pursued by unknown enemies and that he needs people like Helen to help him. For awhile it works and Helen is receiving calls and rendezvousing in secret with Simon. One day when Harry drops by Helen's work to take her out for lunch,he happens to over hear her convo with Simon on the phone. He immediately thinks she is having an affair. Distraught he leaves but decides then and there to bug their phone line and tail her. It all comes crashing down on Simon and Helen when they are out at Simon's trailer. Just as Simon is about to put the push on Helen Harry,with the help of his agent cohorts,storm in on them and they haul Helen and Simon off. A cowering Simon admits to his fantasy scheme to pick up women and is let go. Helen however is ""recruited"" to go undercover as a hooker to plant a bug in the room of one of their targets. It's all a ruse by Harry to goad her on a bit then,now knowing she truly loves him,have a nice intimate evening alone. But things go awry as the terrorists have been following Harry and they capture Harry and his wife and whisk them both to an island in the Florida Keys.
Here the terrorists reveal to the world they have four nuclear warheads that they will detonate if their demands are not met. In fact one is armed and set to go off in an hour and half as a show of determination. With Helen in the loop both she and Harry combine to foil the terrorists and they cause alot of havoc. However in the process they get separated;Helen is taken hostage once more and Harry escapes and is rescued by Albert and friends. They pursue the convoy of Jihadists leaving the island,and two Harrier Marine Jets pound the convoy and take out a section of the causeway,stopping most of them in their tracks. The driver of the car carrying Helen is shot and as the out of control car heads towards the break in the causeway,Harry attempts a daring but successful rescue by helicopter.
On land Harry is informed that some the Jihadists that got away have reached Miami and have his daughter as a hostage. Harry commandeers a jump jet and goes to Miami and to the rescue. His daughter obtains a key that will detonate one the the nuclear devices and is chased out onto a piece of machinery extending far out from the building,a good 200 feet or so up. Harry not only has to contend with the Jihadist leader,but also his compatriots circling in a helicopter all while attempting to rescue his daughter. It all comes to a fitting ending when the leader gets caught up on one of the jets missiles and the helicopter flies into perfect range and alignment. A press of the button by Harry sends the missile and ride into the helicopter taking out two birds with one shot.
The film ends with the couple now BOTH on assignment together. Who should they run into but old Simon,still trying to play the ""spy"" game with someone new. Helen pulls out a tube of lipstick,pulls it under Simon's chin and vows to waste him on the spot. Simon runs off,cowering with pants wet. Helen and Harry tango the night away.
True Lies doesn't have too many slow spots and moves along at a good pace. The movie has that wonderful twist;at first it's Harry leading a double life that his family are unawares of,but then Harry himself gets a shock as his wife,while not leading a double life,at least strongly fantasizes about having one,and Harry's neglect may be the cause. Just as this about to coalesce BOTH are then drawn into the terrorists plans and all is forced out and Helen's transformation from weak and plain to sexy and strong is as appealing a twist as pay day. It's a device that also gives the movie a greater character depth/appeal than would otherwise be. Each scene plays nicely into the next as the action lurks behind every corner,ready to pop out at any time.
What I want to know is this;there is a scene just after Harry has found out Helen has been ""cheating"" on him. When he is about to get in the drivers side of the van to leave you can clearly see a woman about a car length ahead of him standing there with a purse looking in the direction of the camera but really no where in particular. Who is she and .....why??
Technically the movie has been transferred well onto DVD in its original a/r of 2:35:1. Extras include only the trailer.
All in all one of Cameron's better efforts with Ahh-nold in one of his better films along with Jamie Lee Curtis looking particularly sexy,and Tom Arnold and Bill Paxton acquitting themselves handsomely. A great action flick for the guys....and ok the gals can watch too! Highly recommended. 4 1/2 stars.",1299369600,,6262,4.657633242999097

627907,5,6303313345,"Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a secret agent who works for the US Government as he hunts down criminals and various terrorists for 15 years as he lies to his sexy wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and 14 year old daughter Dana (Eliza Duskhu) that he is a computer salesman. But the truth is that he's a secret government agent who hunts down criminals and terrorists around the world with the help of assistant Gibs (Tom Arnold) as they track down terrorist Aziz (Art Malik) who plans on bombing a few major cities here in the states while at the same time Harry isn't spending time with his family as his wife is having an affair secretly with car salesman Simon (Bill Paxton) but can Harry deal with getting his wife back and fight with the terrorists at the same time?

An excellent mix of action, comedy and thrills from writer-producer-director James Cameron. Co-starring sexy Tia Carrera and Charlton Heston, this is an explosive extravaganza of laughs with memorable one-liners like ""Here's my invitation"" and good characterization, Jamie Lee Curtis does her memorable sexy non-nude dance for the audience and the film is vastly underrated. However James Cameron fans like myself including fans of action-comedies will find something delightful in this movie to enjoy for it's a good time for anyone as i always loved it since i was 13 when i saw it in theaters twice.

This DVD contains a good transfer and sound quality with only one extra which is the theatrical trailer, hopefully next year will come out the special edition DVD/Blu-Rays.",1292112000,,1555,4.8641509433962264
627908,2,6303313345,"This movie was cheesy when I saw it the first time back in the 90's and its cheesy now too! The special effects were cool for their time and still look somewhat cool today but the action, the fight scenes and the plot are REALLY far out and unrealistic even for a 90's action movie. Something about this movie struck me as really generic like it was made more for the purpose of making money as opposed to making an original film! If it didn't have so many big names behind it, this film would have BOMBED! It's like someone said, ""Let's get all these big names together, have a bunch of explosions, shooting and action...Then nobody will notice the crummy script!"" It feels like a mishmash of different action movies all blended into an unsavory brew.

Some of the scenes are so far out it almost seems like a spoof on action movies. This puts the movie in the uncomfortable 'gray' area of movies. It isn't funny enough to be a comedy and it is too clich and hokey to be entertaining as an action movie. The characters are wooden and the ending is predictable. The stunts seem to defy physics and logic to the point of being laughable. Lots of action movies (in fact, MOST) stretch the truth to some degree. People ride motorcycles through flames without catching on fire while everyone else burns up behind them. Heroes magically survive machine gun fire where everything around them gets shot to hell...heroes kick 10 guys butts with ease and the guys never get up but the bad guy seems indestructible up until the last moment of a fight and he/she may even come back to life...All these things I can deal with in an action flick but this movie has too much of all of it and goes off the deep end into the realm of ridiculousness.

However, I will give True Lies two stars instead of one. I DO like the actors in the movie and they did a good job of keeping a straight face and acting out silly, stereotypical parts. Neither Jamie nor Arnold is in their best role here but they were probably laughing all the way to the bank! This also isn't the worst action movie ever made, especially when we are talking about 80's and 90's era movies! It does have a little bit of a 90's nostalgia factor too. If you want mindless, sappy entertainment this might be one to watch but I don't think I would watch it again. I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie sucks, really it isn't that bad. I just thought for the stars that were in it and the budget that it didn't quite live up to its potential.",1287360000,3,2492,4.34549356223176

627910,3,6303313345,"The movie is about a husband who is secretly a spy in a clark kent kinda way with his wife and teenage daughter. They have no idea that he is a superhero who can combat crime at a moments notice. Unfortunately his family life suffers, it is humdrum and completely the opposite to who he is when in his role as another James Bond, differing by having brute strength and loyalty to his little homemaker wife. A spin on that agent image, normally the cool cat with all the material comforts, not Harry. He is just a boring husband and pretty absent dad to his daughter. They love him but their life lacks sparkle and excitement. His wife does something to change Harry's demeanor and he is obsessed in his desire to capture back his wife's happiness in life and their marriage. They end up finding out about each other even if it is somewhat unbelievable. They gain adventure together and put imagination and fun in their marriage and family. The things I like about this film, I think being a spy would be a thrilling kind of life, the travel and all the neat inventions that are used in gaining access to information, and the style and polish that are a part of this role, at least how it is seen in films. The creative way Harry involves his wife in a pretend adventure that goes over the top into real life danger, the meeting at a swanky upscale hotel with a hot dance played out by Jamie Lee with comedy, and the ability to be in love with another and bring back color into a family that had lost its ability to shine and connect.",1280188800,,1533,4.344947735191638
627911,5,6303313345,"James Cameron's True Lies has it all--international intrigue, double identities, a secret government organization, a  bored homemaker and secretary, an apparently good husband who's a computer salesman, a fourteen year daughter with issues, a beautiful antiquities dealer, a faithful sidekick, and a terrorist who wants America out of the Middle East.  When you toss in, a police horse, the tango, an apparent used car salesman who moonlights as an international man of danger and mystery, car and helicopter chases, stolen Russian nuclear warheads, the Florida Keys, Miami, and a marine jet, you have a great film.  There is plenty of James Bond type action to keep the adrenalin flowing.

You have a tremendous cast--Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Arnold, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tia Carrere,  a young Eliza Dushku, Art Malik,  and the great Charlton Heston.  A special mention has to be made of Bill Paxton.  His Simon/ Carlos character is a riot to watch.  And the red sports car-ideal tool for his secret agent man.

The chase in the Ambassador Hotel between horse and motorcycle is one well crafted sequence--full of suspense and humor, especially the horse.  The chase on the Seven Mile Bridge is pure excitement with trucks, a limo, helicopters, jets, and explosions.

Film awards include--the Golden Globe for Best Actress; Saturn Award for Best Actress, Director and Special Effects; American Comedy for Best Actress; and the ASCAP Award for best composer.  There a number of other nominations as well.  Jamie Lee Curtis deserved all of these acting awards!

627912,1,6303313345,This DVD lists as being in a wide-screen format which is only a half-truth.  The movie itself is in a wide-screen format but it sized into a 4:3 picture format.

For me this makes the movie unwatchable and is quite annoying considering the box says the format is 2:35:1 when it actually is 4:3.

627973,5,6303313345,"Don't ask this film to be subtle. One more film against the jihad danger from Moslem Arabs with many greedy intermediaries in our beautiful western world. An atom bomb is worth a lot on the black market of military equipment. But the film is funny because Cameron makes it so. Schwarzenegger can come out of a frozen lake in a wetsuit but when he gets the wet suit off you can be sure his tuxedo and bow tie underneath are absolutely neatly pressed as well as if they were coming out of the Chinese laundry shop round the corner in Chinatown in San Francisco. There are so many incongruities, over-killings, a horse in a lift, a motorbike jumping from the roof of a skyscraper directly into the swimming pool on top of the next sky-scraper, etc. Luckily the horse is not insane that is forced to run after the motorbike: it refuses to jump and throws our dear Schwarzenegger over who manages to hold the reins and to make the horse back up and save his skin from a very deep fall. That's the only interest of that film. Extreme impossibility. But the last tango in Switzerland is a good mopping exercise with Swarzie's wife being dragged on the floor as if she were the mop mopping it. I just wonder what his vision of a bullfight would be: sweeping the arena with the dead bull? So enjoy the laugh and forget the narrow-minded political discourse that is just proved dumb by the extreme excess of the film, the plot, etc.

628113,5,6303313345,"From start to finish, `True Lies' is nothing short of engaging.  In fact, it is more than that.  It is funny, tense, gripping and even, get this, shockingly tender.  Yes, `True Lies' has just about everything you could ask for all rolled up in one nicely constructed package.  It is so `complete' that it doesn't even matter that the film is above and beyond ridiculous (that is to say that it makes no sense whatsoever and manages to be very, very unrealistic).  It makes up for every flaw with stellar performances, witty dialog, eye-popping visuals and endearing characters.

One great thing about this movie is that, even when the action sequences are beyond unrealistic (the horse chase scene and the jet rescue ending are two of the more over-the-top sequences) they never look fake.  This isn't so CGI ridden that the film appears nothing more than a videogame.  Thankfully each and ever scene looks as if it is really happening and thus adds to the film a layer of credibility.

It works even if it technically shouldn't.

The film follows a seemingly boring family, the Tasker's, as their world unravels when Harry, the `computer salesman' husband, begins to suspect that his wife Helen is having an affair.  He overreacts and thus compromises his own identity (he's a secret spy, duh) when he uses his position to investigate his wife.  When a real case he's working crosses the line into his home life he finds that his entire family is thrown in the frying pan and he desperately tries to pull them out.

The entire cast works wonderfully; even Arnold.  Well, I guess I should specify that, since there are two Arnold's here.  Tom Arnold is hilarious.  I really like him as the goofy sidekick (which he plays in EVERY film really, although he stretched himself with major success in 2005's `Happy Endings') and here he delivers each line with the right amount of comedic sarcasm.  The other Arnold, Schwartzenegger that is, is also perfect for the role.  He even emotes here, which I was shocked to see.  He's funny and debonair and moving at times.  He's not perfect, that's for sure, but he works far better than I though he would.  Bill Paxton has a hilarious supporting role as a used car salesman trying to put the moves on Helen.

Speaking of Helen, Jamie Lee Curtis is above and beyond spectacular here.

Curtis knows how to make this character feel human.  She has the right comedic touches to her general being to make her appear naturally out of her element, which adds layers of realism to her giddy nature and even her over-controlled side.  She also knows how to add enough heart to her character to make her tenderer and sincere moments feel genuine.  Her interrogation scene is a marvelous example of an actress adding so many layers and so many notes that her character becomes so much more than just a `housewife'.  She plays the funny, awkward, confused, desperate housewife with a tough-as-nails side to utter perfection.

Director James Cameron is no stranger to special effects and action spectacles and so the action scenes are no real surprise.  Whether Arnold is galloping through a hotel on a horse or he's crashing into buildings with a jet or he's smashing dogs together by their heads, he looks in control because Cameron was in complete control.  What was shocking to me were the tender moments that Cameron was able to capture.  That interrogation room scene as well as Curtis's dance scene are two precise and appropriate sequences that elevate the film and give it a human feeling.  He found that humanity in `Titanic' three years later, but even still, what he does here surprised me.  When you factor in that he added so many wonderful layers of comedic perfection it makes the complete finished product all the more lovable.",1240272000,,3771,4.770061728395062

Arnold stars as Harry Tasker, a secret agent who is on a mission in Switzerland trying to get information about a terrorist that has stolen warheads. When he is at home, his wife named Helen and rebellious daughter named Dana think he is a boring computer salesman. Harry works for Omega Sector, that try to stop Salim Abu Aziz from setting off bombs in America. To add to Harry's problems, he thinks his wife is having an affair with a guy named Simon who claims to be a spy.

628119,4,6303313345,"True Lies has long been on the Sid the Elf back-burner. It was on the list of films that must be reviewed at some point, and kind of became an emergency B. It was like the Vinny Testaverde of B, weren't too excited to use it because of the apparent clumsiness involved, but if first and second options failed, you might be ok going with it. Well, we officially went into emergency B mode this week so we went with True Lies. It turns out that we were exactly right, there was a ton of clumsiness to endure, but in the end Sid came out ok. Really, you're never in bad hands with Arnold. If Amazon had his California tourism commercials on DVD, we'd not only review them, we'd give them 5 stars. The point is, we could get a laugh or a hundred out of Arnold saying anything at all. True lies was no exception.

In this film, Arnold plays  super terrific secret agent Harry Tasker. Tasker's family believes he is a computer salesman, that he loves the computer business, and that he is an incredibly boring person. His mission is to track down nuclear warheads stolen by an arms smuggler from Kazakhstan. We were blown away when we learned that Borat's country was prominently involved in this film. So Arnold goes to a party at the arms dealer's house where he meets Cassandra from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wayne-s-World-2/dp/B00005JH9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wayne's World 2</a>. She is an antique dealer who is using her business as a front to smuggle the warheads for Aziz the leader of a terrorist organization into U.S. and A, greatest country in the world. Once Arnold starts poking around the situation, Aziz decides to follow him. Arnold, of course, is much too smart for this. He leads Aziz into a mall where he procedes to catch him with the front and make Aziz blead inside his chest. Aziz manages to get away on a motorcycle, being chased by Arnold on a horse. A terribly B action sequence ensues and Aziz gets away. Just great B all-around, trust us.

Arnold then finds out that his wife, Laurie Strode, is having a kind of affair with a guy named Simon, who is a B version of Lester Diamond. This is the intentional comedy part of the film with Arnold using secret agent methods to track Simon and his wife. Simon pretends to be a spy to get chicks. Harry and his sidekick, Tom Arnold, kidnap Laurie and interigate her through a one-way mirror. They find out that Mrs. Tasker hasn't done anything with Simon Diamond, but that she is bored with Harry and craves adventure. So Harry gives her a fake assignment, which entails her going to a hotel room and getting ready to have a sexy time with a supposed stranger, even though it was really Arnold doing soundboard in the shadows. Anyway, the terrorists bust into the hotel room and take Harry and Helen prisioner. Some of the most ridiculous action sequences ever filmed ensue, including the famous Arnold iso-rowing Jamie Lee Curtis from the limo to the helicopter scene. So he just saved his wife from the terrorists, now they have kidnapped his daughter. Harry's daughter is played by a young Eliza Dushku. In case you were wondering, the ruling on the field is that it is ok to think she's hot here--moving on. She manages to get the arming key for the missles and has Aziz chase her onto the top of a skyscraper. Arnold flies to her in a marine jet and has her jump in. Ok. Aziz manages to jump onto the plane as well, but he is hanging from a missle. So Arnold fires the missle into a helicopter carrying the other terrorists and kills them all. That encapsulates why Sid believes Arnold should be the sole exception to the law stating the president must be born in the U.S. At the end of the film, we see that Arnold and Jamie Lee are now secret agent partners as they go off to a mission together.

This film was an action-comedy(both intentional and unintentional), by James Cameron. We liked it, but we also lost interest in the second half of the film. Maybe we just couldn't resist the lure of the Arnold soundboard after listening to him for a solid 45 minutes. Maybe it was only enjoyable after doing a unit in the bushes and making countless ""Good. Now we are having fun"" jokes and assesing the parallels of the film with Wayne's World 2 because of Charlton Heston and Tia Carrere. If you're an Arnold fan, it's certainly a must. You can always laugh at Arnold and as a bonus, you can make fun of Tom Arnold and his ""I can't believe they gave me this part!"" glow throughout the film. This film isn't the Governator's best work, but it did just fine in a B pinch. Without hesitation, Sid recomends.",1226448000,,4628,4.585748792270532

Does anyone know that the idea to make this came from Arnold? Yeah, Arnold and Jim were sitting at breakfast. Cameron asked him what he wanted do next. And Arnold replied that he had just seen a French film, and thought the lead would be a great role for him. Cameron was interested right away, because this was the first time Arnie wanted to do a picture because of the character. Arnold also didn't like the idea of Jamie being his leading lady at first. Thank God Cameron eventually convinced him otherwise.

This is a great, fun classic film in the same league as oh, say, Raiders of the Lost Ark. It deserves a special edition with retrospective interviews and such. Not to say that some other Cameron film releases - certain ones about giant boats doesn't need a retrospective documentary.

628257,5,6303313345,"All of James Cameron's films have a sense of seriousness to them, even with a little humor now and then. From the wonder of the Abyss to the technology-run-rampant theme of the Terminator films, it's interesting watching True Lies and you keep wondering whether this is the same guy. But rather than a less-than-stellar flirting with an action und comedy (gotta love Simpsons references), True Lies is actually a really fun film to watch and although it may not have the cultural staying power of Terminator 2 or Titanic, it's still quite a good ride.

Harry Tasker is a boring IT salesman; well that's what he wants people to think as he really is a government spy helping to bring down terrorists and their organizations. But like a lot of spies, he doesn't bring his work home, leaving his wife Helen and daughter Dana unaware of his ""real"" job. But when a terrorist group planning to bring a nuclear weapon onto US soil, Helen inadvertenly gets involved and Harry has to come clean to his family...oh and save the country too.

Cameron is one of the few directors who knows how to shoot action sequences and have them be exciting and make sense, unlike someone like say, Michael Bay, who uses quick editing to mask his ineptitudes as a directors. Some scenes with highlights involving a rescue mission on a bridge, a chase scene with a horse and another scene involving a Harrier jet are fun but we also care for the characters involved in the scenes and they're not just action figures doing crazy stuff.

It's funny to say this is probably one of Arnold's better performances who manages to use his action hero persona as well as comedic workings yet both work together unlike say Junior where it was just...bad. Then of course we have Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Arnold who manage to be funny without that sort of annoying ""comic relief"" character. The one weak link, and really it's not an acting thing, is Bill Paxton. Playing a swarmy car salesmen who lies to bed women, he plays it as he should be but it's probably the most unnecessary role. It strengthens Harry's devotion for Helen and he also realizes how safe her life has been but Paxton's character doesn't really do anything better writing could've done without him.

Either he's busy getting Avatar off the ground or he just doesn't want to but it's sad this film doesn't have a special edition. Granted it's not as popular as Terminator 2 or massively well-known as Titanic but you'd think we'd have had something by now. As of now, this is incredibly bare bones and it would've been great to have some insight look and even a commentary but who knows when that'll be.

Interestingly, 2 of my favorite directors (one being Cameron, the other being David Fincher) lead similar careers. For every great movie they make, they have one that somehow slipped through the cracks. In that sense, True Lies is like Fincher's the Game: they're both good movies that for some reason people just kind of forgot about except for diehard fans. I wouldn't call myself a ""diehard"" fan but True Lies is just a fun movie in the end so that's good enough.",1185580800,2,3104,4.646630236794171

628259,3,6303313345,"""True Lies"" is one of my favorite action films, being at the same time one of the prototypical mid 1990's action films and a parody of the same genre. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and action throughout the course of the film. It's a must see if you like Arnold.

However, the DVD release presented here is brutal. Do not let the THX certification on the front of the DVD case fool you. The film is presented in 2.35:1 aspect ration, but is not anamorphic widescreen, a format optimized for widescreen televisions. It is presented in letterbox format instead, which means that the picture is much, much worse than its anamorphic equivalent because the black bars at the top and bottom are actually encoded into the video stream. This process leaves less room in the video encoding for the actual image, reducing its quality. Anamorphic widescreen leaves the black bars out of the video encoding, preserving more of the video stream for the actual image and allowing the DVD player and TV to add the black bars if necessary. Since a widescreen TV does not have need for these bars, they can be left off entirely, leaving only the high quality image.

Anamorphic widescreen has been a standard feature of DVDs for years now, so it's easy to forget that not all DVDs have it. Old DVDs are especially suspect on this front. If you have a nice television, the lack of anamorphic widescreen will be very noticeable and distracting throughout the film.

His marvelous wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) nor their teenage daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku) know anything about it... Helen thinks he's rather a dull computer salesman...

Things go rough when Harrie begins to suspect that his wife, a very conservative secretary, maybe is having an affair with a man pretending to be a spy... So he immediately brings all the resources of his department to find out what is really going on... In addition, Harry was focusing on a Middle Eastern terrorist group called the Crimson Jihad who terrorizes the United States with nuclear weapons...

In my mind, and I'll bet the rest of you will feel the same as well, Schwarzenegger has enough physical bravado for the job... Best example: his scene holding Helen from the moving helicopter... He does a credible 007--like character, especially out, in and around an ultra exclusive Swiss chteau... His hot tango, with Asian beauty Tia Carrere, establishes Harry's grace and charm...

Jamie Lee Curtis shows she is indeed a sweet delight in the way she moves... This attractive star still has a great figure... Her arousing striptease is hilarious and sexy...

Tom Arnold (Albert Gibson) does all of the background work in the van, while his partner Harry saves the world, in killing bad guys...

Tia Carrere brings a sensuous style as the wild, hot-blooded psycho-seductress, driven by powerful ambitions...

Bill Paxton becomes funnier as we get to know him... He feels lucky as Helen's enigmatic suitor, convincing the naive woman, through a series of ""chance"" encounters, that he is an international spy...

Art Malik makes an appropriately super-villain especially considering what he is supposed to be portraying: the face of terrorism, with fanatical actions shaped by a fundamental antagonism against United States... You'll explode with laughter watching what occurs when our super hero tells him, ""You're fired.""

With 'True Lies,' a vivid reminder of just how exciting an action film can be, director James Cameron gives us a film that plays for laughs enough that it works... Watch Schwarzenegger on top of the skyscraper wanting a horse he is riding to jump to another building... The $100 million in special effects are very impressive... The best example: Harrier fighters blowing out a bridge; and a standout scene that has to been seen to be believed:the rescue of Arnold's daughter with a Harrier Jetfighter...

Six months have elapsed since (September 11th, 2001) that terrible day of infamy tore at America's soul... On Sunday, October 7, 2001, the United States and Britain began air strikes against Al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Afghanistan...

I think each nation must struggle against violence and for peace... We will never eradicate terrorism altogether, but we can certainly minimize its destructive impact...

628306,5,6303313345,"The plot of ""True Lies"" is not all that unbelievable - Muslim fanatics want to use a nuclear weapon on American soil. It's especially true in today's world, where a good portion of the Middle East, and religious fanatics within that area, want to kill anyone from a Western culture.  It's up to Arnold Schwarz and a funny sidekick, Tom Arnold, to save the day.

Aside from being a mountain of a man, and having one of the most unique accents ever, Arnold Schwarz could actually be a top secret operative.  Although, his size and accent would make it so that he would have very few missions, because sooner or later everyone would start to recognize him.  However, the ones he was on, he would totally destroy everything.  I'm sure of that.

True Lies starts off with Arnold at his best; he's a spy at a fancy ball, dressed in a tux and there for spy business.  It's only a matter of time before the bad guys are on his heels, and he has to distract them with a tango.  Yes, a tango.  Arnold grabs Tia Carerre by the arm, does the most rigid, non-sexual, unappealing tango ever, and absolutely fools the people looking for him.  Somehow this is possible, except for the fact that he was probably the only 6'5"", 250lb, body builder from Austria in the room.

After the dance, Arnold makes his way out of the party by doing typical Arnold stuff: he blows up buildings, shoots everyone in sight, and escapes in the nick of time.  It's actually one of my favorite scenes because it reminds me of the totally ridiculous carnage in Commando, where Arnold is deadly with every bullet fired from his pistol, but the men firing back with automatic weapons are spraying wildly around him.

Things I learned that Arnold the spy can do: smash a car window with a backhand, fly a fighter jet, speak several languages, ride a horse, park a car like a stunt driver, fight with all his wits while under heavy sedation, and tear the hell out of a public restroom.

The movie evolves as typical spy movies do; there is a ton of fighting, a few story loops, a one or two crazy chase scenes, classic (cheesy) lines from Arnold as he dispatches villains, and more bullets fired than at the Source Awards.  And just like nearly all other movies of this genre, the good guys undertake an epic battle/task, eventually win, get the girl, and save the Earth.  It's exactly what I expected, and exactly what I received.

It's a great movie.  Be on the lookout for Jamie Lee Curtis dancing as you've never seen her, Chet playing a hilarious role as the biggest loser in the world, and an appearance by Eliza Dushku in her early years.",1155600000,,2605,4.483050847457627
628307,5,6303313345,"True Lies is a great movie. It has frenetic action sequences, sarcastic sidekick humor, funny domestic Ozzie & Harriet scenes, and great dramatic denouements. I personally consider it to be Schwartzenegger's last great bonafide success (Terminator 3 didn't live up to the hype or the box office take-in predictions).

Harry Tasker is a deadly secret agent, toiling for the Omega Sector, where he can be found usually hip-deep in dangerous shenanigans. As a spy, he deals daily in death, foils madmen's plots with easy aplomb, and dances a mean tango. Meanwhile, his personal life is slowly circling down the drain. His spy job takes up most of his attention; he barely has time for family commitments. His longtime wife Helen, unaware of Harry's clandestine profession, knows him as a sales rep and thinks him boring and plodding. His teenage daughter Dana is rebelling. But Harry's world is shockingly upended when he suspects his wife of extramarital behavior and goes comedically ballistic. His ensuing inappropriate use of government resources is laugh out loud funny. The resulting events range from slapstick antics to calamitous, high stakes jeopardy, as Harry's professional and personal lives finally converge.

This has to be one of Arnold's best films; it ranks right up there with the Terminator movies, Predator, and Total Recall. True Lies is an exhilarating blend of all-out spy action and romantic screwball comedy. The eye-popping stunts alone are worth the price of admission (the hotel game of tag with Arnold on horseback doggedly pursuing his motorbiking quarry, the extended shoot-em-up chase scene on the 7 Mile Bridge, the awesome Marine Harrier sequence...). Think what you will about the egocentric James Cameron. He knows how to dynamically direct a movie. But, in my opinion, the frequent touches of humor are what gives the movie its heart and carries this film past the generic action flick, making it into an all-time classic (the priceless hotel room scene with Helen posing as a stripteasing ""escort""; the terrorist lackey who video records his insane leader's ranting manifesto, only to find the camera battery running out, etc.). The chemistry between Arnold and Jamie Lee is only surpassed by the buddy chemistry between Arnold and Tom. The performances are pitch perfect. Arnold has fun playing the clueless domestic father and husband while still living up to his trademark ""I'll be back"" persona. Jamie Lee plays it sedately at first and then hilariously over the top as the bored, thrill-seeking spouse. Tom Arnold, at his wise-cracking best, hams it up as the irreverent but faithful sidekick. These actors have never been better. To round out the superlative cast, you have Bill Paxton (great sleazy character!), sexy Tia Carrere (shwing!), a pre-Buffy and -Tru Calling Eliza Dushku, and the deadly serious Art Malik, who plays the main baddie.

It sucks to say, but the only halfway decent films Arnold made after True Lies were Eraser, End of Days, Terminator 3. He's a bit past it now to be playing the action hero. He pretty much admitted as much when he cameod in the Rock's The Rundown and officially passed him the torch. ""Have fun,"" he tells the Rock. Still, here's hoping True Lies 2 gets made.",1153267200,,3245,5.073033707865169

Reason being, I noticed that in every action scene, whether it be fighting a guy or running through the woods, Arnold uses a stunt man for every one of those scenes. And the stunt dude did not resemble Arnold very much at all. I hate it when they do that in movies. I understand some of the scenes having to use a stunt man for safety reasons, but Arnold can't even run through the woods. Anway, after saying that, its still a pretty good flick.

That's what Helen thinks until she finds out that her ordinary husband is a secret agent.  Both lives collide and both Harry and Helen must save the world and themselves.

As I have said before, what Arnold does best is action with a hint of comedy.  This is exactly that.  To add to this is Jamie Lee Curtis.  She inherited her father's natural comedy sense and handles the action scenes perfectly.  The only negative is Tom Arnold as Arnold's sidekick.  He is pure slapstick and not very good at that.

The special effects and stunt work is excellent.  Director James Cameron excels at this.

628406,5,6303313345,"The plot is covered in so many of these reviews I won't go there.  I will concur with repeated comment that these are Arnold's and Tom's best performances to date.  Jamie Lee Curtis is great too (and if you agree check her out in ""A Fish Called Wanda""), as is Bill Paxton doing another outstanding, funny, loudmouth coward (as he did in ""Aliens"").  No performance in this film disappoints.

As a product package, this DVD is lacking in the Special Features department -- nothing but the trailer?  Come on!  I bought this on VHS and then on DVD and I would gladly buy it again with the kind of Special Features that James Cameron's other projects get -- I'm thinking here of ""Aliens"" and ""Dark Angel.""  I would of course expect to pay more than for this bare bones disc, which is worth having until the deluxe package comes out.

Trivia: in Robert Rodriguez' ""Once Upon A Time in Mexico"" Johnny Depp says ""This is no time to screw the pooch"" and Robert says in the Special Features that it was one of Johnny's many ad libs, and that he (Robert) had never heard the phrase before.  This movie is where I first heard it, used in precisely the same way, if not the same tense (past as opposed to present) by Double-O Arnold's boss.  Don't know if it's spy speak or movie speak.

Last note: I disagree that this movie doesn't treat women with respect.  Lot's of men lie to their wives for less acceptable reasons than this one, and Jamie's character holds her own even before she finds out what's really going on.  This couple is really in love, after over a decade of marriage, and they work out their personal problems AND save (most of) the country.

It's worth checking out, even if this isn't usually your kind of movie.",1132876800,2,1720,4.453674121405751
628407,4,6303313345,"This James Cameron action-adventure starts with a bang and ends with one, but gets sidetracked along the way in a subplot that adds little to the overall value. Schwarzenegger stars as a secret agent, with Jamie Lee Curtis as his unsuspecting wife, Tom Arnold as his sidekick and Bill Paxton as a sleazebag used car salesman who tries to seduce wife Jamie Lee by posing as a special agent himself. Although this part of the plot is entertaining, it takes us away from the main plot - which is about stopping a terrorist splinter group that's gone nuclear - for almost an hour. We practically have to remind ourselves whom the terrorists are when they return.

We open on a James Bond type scene in a European chateau, which includes Arnold doing a tango with a beautiful artifacts dealer while Tom waits impatiently in the van. Arnold realizes she's really an agent, as he investigates her further; but when she discovers who he is, she has him tailed into a restroom by assassins, where a great fight scene ensues, followed by a terrific chase sequence - with the bad guy on a motorcycle and Arnold on horseback - through town, into a hotel, up an elevator and off a roof. There are unbelievable stunts - in both senses of the word - with the horse, in this case, stealing the show.

If the film had continued in this direction, it would have been much better, because the secret agent world of Arnold and Tom is full of cool gadgets, danger and a boss who can't be pleased, played by Charlton Heston. Plus, the two men make a great team. Tom is likeable as he tries to give Arnold advice on marriage and child rearing - none of it encouraging, but all of it funny. Arnold and Tom use their secret agent skills to discourage Bill from pursuing Jamie Lee; and, although Paxton is funny, and his scenes are entertaining, they cause the main plot to lose momentum. A better job at editing could possibly have solved the problem, as the movie tends to run a little long. (It's nearly two-and-a-half hours.) The movie begins with a tango scene and it ends, wonderfully, the same way.

628408,5,6303313345,"Generally, Arnold Schwarzenegger's films are a hit or miss affair. However, thanks to a good script, dazzling special effects and a reunion with ""Terminator"" director James Cameron, the governator's 1994 vehicle ""True Lies"" turned out to be one of his best movies. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's his best film outisde of the first two ""Terminator"" movies.

Performance wise, this is Schwarzenegger at his best. He plays superspy Harry Tasker, who along with his partner Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold in a rare winning performance) work for a secret government organization known as Omega. However, to his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and his daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku), he's just an Average Joe who sells computer for a living. For 15 years, he's been able to keep his life a secret.

For their next assginment, Harry and Albert are out to stop terrorist Salim Abu Aziz (played with scenery chewing finesse by well known character actor Art Malik), who has smuggled various explosives in hopes of laucnhing attacks across the U.S. Malik and his girlfriend Juno Skinner (Tia Carerre) always manage to be one step ahead of Tasker. Then, to make matters more complicated, Harry learns that his wife is having an affair with a man named Simon (Bill Paxton). This leads to several intrigung twists and turns, many of them often hilarious but mostly filled with nonstop action.

In actuality the husband is NOT the boring Lugg his wife thinks he is NOR is the wife just a simple Little Woman.

The special effects are definitely special, considering this movie was made in 1994.  And actually, the whole nuclear arms smuggling/Arab terrorism is a terrible foreshadowing, if you think about it; some of the action toward the end of the movie actually mirrors the events of 9/11.

Anyhow, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold are simply hilarious.  Jamie Lee Curtis (as the first Arnold's wife) won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy for her role in this one, and she does not disappoint.  She doesn't disappoint in the sex department, either; from what I understand she required NO body doubles.  And veteran actor Charlton Heston has an agreeable cameo.

This is surely a crowd-pleasing movie across the board; it has something for everyone.  Highly imaginative and well-executed; many notches above the tripe they hand us in the mid-2000s.",1124236800,,984,5.1
628412,5,6303313345,"This is one of the most entertaining action movies, and what makes it really appealing (beside special effects), is an interplay between well developed characters. The casting is first rate. Both Arnolds are terrific, exuding humor and special chemistry that often exists between opposite personalities. On a similar level is Tia Carrere. Art Malik skillfully hides his British accent behind Arabic one. I saw him years ago in some BBC TV production, and that was a memorable, subtle performance. He is excellent here too, although in a different way. Among other roles, my only disappointment turned out to be Harry's wife (and perhaps the daughter too - must be genetic). If almost every other character in the movie is larger than life, Helen Tasker is rather ordinary, and remains such even after the life transforming experience in the middle of the feature. Such normalcy puts her at odds with the rest of the ensemble. This may not be entirely Curtis' fault, however, but the result of overextended writing, which, in her case, drags the action.
It seems that the creators of this film in their rush to produce another AS box-office hit did not expect it to come out so well, or they would have tightened the plot and plugged a few holes in it. Despite that, the highest recommendation is still in order.",1123891200,,1311,4.857142857142857

628475,4,6303313345,"I officially love this movie. It's my favourite Arnie film ever, plus it has a very young Eliza Dushku in one of her first starring roles. However, I am disappointed to discover, after getting the region 2 version, that it was cut for UK viewers, in order to make it a 15 certificate, and making it 135 minutes long. I could only spot one scene that had been cut, and that's because it was done so badly. (I can spot stuff that's been added in, but I'm hopeless at spotting stuff that's been taken out, unless I'm looking for it) The scene I spotted was just after Arnie gets given the truth drug.

This movie is full of memorable and infamous scenes, including Jamie Lee Curtis' stripping scene, the beginning scenes, the finale (although heavily CGI-d by the looks of it!), Jamie & Tia Carrere (Juno Skinner) fighting in the limo and put it this way, Men In Black & the Matrix (heavily) ripped this movie off. A lot of this is what you see in the Matrix. Tom Arnold is terrific, especially when he's trying to get to Arnie in the van, and skidding about on the ice! (""It's called ice and it gets a little slick."") OK, you have to see it, but when he sees Dana (Eliza) with a motorbike helmet and says to her: ""Yeah, I remember the first time I got shot out of a cannon."" Or: ""You know what? I'm sick of being in the van. You guys are going to be in the van next time. I've been in the van for 15 years, Harry.""

When Arnie rescues wife Jamie Lee Curtis from an airborne chopper, he grasps her by her arm just as the chopper heads out over the water. The woman you see dangling below the chopper skid is no body double, but Curtis doing her very own stunt work. At her insistence, director James Cameron agreed to let her perform this scary spectacle.

I absolutely LOVE how Arnie can laugh at himself, bringing out his infamous lines (""You're fired""), and doing everything but winking at the camera. One of his best moments in this is when he's at the urinal and he starts whistling ""Edelweiss"" from The Sound of Music. He also learned how to land and take off a Harrier Jet for the climax of the film.

The place where Helen meets Simon at night is the 6th street bridge, the location used in Terminator 2: Judgment Day when we are introduced to the T-1000.

Bill Paxton is absolutely hilarious as the used car salesman, who's fantasy world quickly becomes reality. You can't help but laugh at this guy when he comes on screen.

My only quibble about this movie? The finale. Although it's great, yadeyadeyada, it's so very much not real, and way too over the top! The only thing that tries to save it is Eliza Dushku, getting in some practice for Tru Calling.

628478,4,6303313345,"The thing to remember about ""True Lies"" is that you can't take is seriously. With movies like this, you simply have to sit back and enjoy its implausibility.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Harry Tasker, an agent working for a top-secret government organization called The Omega Sector. His parter Gib (Tom Arnold) is pretty much a slacker and exists only to provide comic relief. Harry's wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teenage daughter (Eliza Dushku) think he is a boring computer salesman.

Events occur in which Harry must prevent an Islamic terrorist (Art Malik) from detonating a nuclear bomb on U.S. soil. And, of course, Helen and his daughter become involved.

Schwarzenegger is very good in this movie. Tom Arnold's character was hilarious, if not pointless. Curtis excelled as Helen, but the villain was pretty forgetful. Bill Paxton's subplot, while not having much to do with the actual story, was very entertaining.

The best thing about ""True Lies"" was the action setpieces. From the opening escape to the climatic showdown in a Harrier jet, the action scenes were SPECTACULAR. James Cameron always incorporates eye-popping special effects into his films, and this movie is no exception. The effects got an Oscar nomination, ultimately loosing to ""Forrest Gump.""

""True Lies"" is a wildly entertaining action movie. I recommend it. Sure, it may be unbelievable, but how many films really are believable? Not many.",1104192000,,1426,5.209606986899563
628479,4,6303313345,"Schwrzenegger laughs at Schwarzenegger (and Jamie Lee Curtis laughs at Rambo). It is surprising when you look at the paralelism with this movie and ""Demolition Man"". Stallone laughs at Stallone and Sandra Bullock laughs at Schwarzenegger. I'm refering to two scenes of both pictures: in the first, Jamie Lee Curtis says she is married to Rambo and in the second Sandra Bullock tells Spartan Arnold is the President of the United States.

Besides this, the film is a acidous criticism of all action movies. How can you do this? By abusing of action scenes. The summum is when Helen (J.L. Curtis) throws a gun down the stairs and it begins to roll and shoot killing more than 20. It is deliciously ridiculous!

More than the plot, which is really enjoyable, the gags are in every part of the film but one of the best is the scene in which Harry (A. Schwarzenegger) dances with Helen. Sorry, he doesn't dance: he intends to move his body in a way he almost follows the rhythm of music.

Arnold and Jamie make a good acting part. Not considering Schwarzenegger an actor, in this movie he makes his best performance ever, which reminds me at ""Kindergarten Cop"". Personally it is more enjoyable to watch him in comedy films (""Twins"", ""Junior""), than in pure action films (""Predator"", ""Terminator""). But in this one you get the best of both.

(Hint: Curtis may very well be an alpha-female. Maybe and ENTJ.) The action sequences in this film, as in all Cameron films, have a serious true-to-life feel. Arnold may very well be a psychopath as he slaughters deranged terrorist after deranged terrorist utterly without remorse or even blinking an eye. But the way it's done you really get the feeling that the violence is essential to the story and had to be done this way.

The story's suspense derives entirely from the US President acting like a nincompoop. Which speaks well neither towards Clancy the democrat nor Clancy the patriot.) Which is why Cameron is better than Sam Peckinpah, who filmed Tarkovsky-like action sequences that often seemed out of place.
There's also enough gadgetry in this film to keep the editors of Maxim busy for at least a year. The subbasement of the building Arnold and co-star Tom Arnold work in is a standout true geek heaven. Cameron really delivers the goods.",1100476800,2,1484,4.60377358490566
628481,2,6303313345,"True Lies (James Cameron, 1994)

Perhaps in the hands of any director who's not one of the Great Triumvirate of Hollywood Hacks-- Steven Spielberg, Joel Schumacher, and James Cameron-- True Lies would have been an interesting and funny satire on the mindless-action-film genre. After all, it was clever enough to actually pull in real action-film star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead, it comes off looking as if James Cameron actually took the script seriously, and the result is overlong, boring, and not too terribly fun to watch.

Harry Tasker (The Governator) is a secret agent whose wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks he's a computer salesman. Harry finds out his wife is having an affair with a used car salesman, Simon (Cameron regular Bill Paxton), who's masquerading as a secret agent and taking credit for all the things Harry and his partner, Al Gibson (Tom Arnold, recently in Mr. 3000), are actually doing. For a lark, Harry kidnaps Helen, plays along with the idea that Simon is actually the secret agent, and that the agency wants Helen to work for them, all as an elaborate way to get her back. Hat is, until real terrorists show up at the assignation, leading into a comedy-of-errors-style second half of the movie.

You can see the potential, right? Even Woody Allen, the least funny man in America, could probably have gotten it right. Not so Cameron, who somewhere between T2 and True Lies really dropped the action-movie ball. (His humbling wasn't complete until the cinematic waste that was Titanic, but this was close.) Too much of the movie isn't played for the kind of laughs it should be, to the point where when it is played for laughs, it seems as if it's more the tension-relief laughter all good suspense movies need in order to keep the pace flowing. The problem is, if that was the intention, it doesn't work that way here. There's too much that could have happened and didn't, and too much that probably shouldn't have happened that did. The latter is probably the greater sin; the film runs two and a half hours, give or take a few minutes.

Could have been great. Is run of the mill. **",1100131200,3,2122,4.758152173913044

628483,2,6303313345,"I recently succumbed to an opportunity to screen this film for the first time in eight years, hoping to blot-out or at least ignore the reputable chauvinistic elements in favor of the film's redeeming features.  Alas, I confess, I'm not as resillient as I thought.

While the stereotypical portrayal of those of middle eastern origin is roughly on par with that of a million other right-wing action flicks, the film's blatant sexism is in a class by itself.

Granted, I've never liked Jamie Lee Curtis, but her demeaning portrayal in the role of  Schwartzneggar's wife is almost too painful to watch.  Apart from the scene in which she is confined and interrogated on account of her husband's suspicion of having an affair, her on-screen persona embodies little more than that of a jittery, bumbling, dim-witted scream factory, with little more purpose than to showcase the potency of her soprano-tinged shrieks from scene to scene.

Then, of course, there's the role of Juno Skinner.  Anyone inferring the casting of Tia Carerre in the role of the antagonistic XO as conducive to the presence of a strong-willed femme fatale are bound to be sorely dissappointed.  Quite frankly, this non-imposing second-in-command couldn't be more frail if she tried, her physical potency limited to the muzzle velocity of her concealed .45 and further compromised by the fact that she can't seem to hit the broadside of a barn door.  She willfully allows her associate to repeatedly smack her about the face, brushing off his abuse with little more than a lame-brained ""At least you're paying me a lot of money"" remark.  The mere presence of wielding the business end of a hold-up offers no bearings on her propensity to get caught off-guard on both occasions and (get this!), she instructs her subordinates to hold off on unveiling the week's supply of nuclear warheads until she can get her purse out of the way!

Then, there's that stupid cat-fight-in-the-back-of-a-runaway-limo sequence, in which the two feminine leads squeal about in a lame-brained hair-pulling contest, practically clawing up the upholstery in the process.

Granted, certain degrees of sexism still tend to be an integral component in the majority of hollywood flicks, but I can only tolerate so much.",1098403200,2,2261,5.064690026954178
628553,3,6303313345,"As for the movie, I love it!  I think it's one of Arnold's most entertaining films.  Another plus about this dvd release is the use of 2.35 aspect ratio.  Now for the bad news, the people at Fox pictures apparently didn't care enough about this release to clean the film before they burned it to dvd, which is obvious while watching it.  It has those annoying dust specs, that you many times see while watching movies in the theaters.  I literally own two hundred dvds and I've never seen such an enormous amounts of these specs that it actually distracted me from the movie, but that is truly the case here.

I am currently looking for an older dvd release of this movie that maintains the same ratio, but doesn't have the dust specs.  It may sound like I'm being too picky, but trust me when I say that they grow annoying and a person shouldn't have put up with them after paying for a brand new dvd.  I give the movie a rating of 5 stars, but lower my rating because of Fox Movies poor workmanship.

By the way, the visual problems aren't limited to annoying dust specs.  In addition I noticed a scene in this film where this white blob (about the diameter of two of my thumbs together) appear on the screen next to Arnold Schwarzenegger's head during the film for about one half second.  I'm 90% confident that these errors are present throughout the film, but became annoyed enough not to watch the movie all the way through.

His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) has no idea about his involvement with Omega.  She believes that he is a simple computer salesman.  Tom Arnold stars as Albert Gibson, Harry's trusty sidekick.

Omega is on the trail of the Crimson Jihad-a terrorist organization which has acquired nuclear weapons and is threatening to blow up a different American city each week.  Tia Carrere (Juno Skinner) is a member of this organization and has captured Harry and Helen and taken them to an island in the Florida Keys.  Will Harry and Helen survive or will the terrorists prevail?

I highly recommend this action-packed movie.  Schwarzenegger, Curtis, Arnold, Carrere, and Chaleton Heston are excellent in their roles.  The special effects are especially well-done, with the Harrier jet raid on the bridge being one of the best special effect scenes.  But the best scene of the movie has to be Jamie Lee's sexy dance in her black underwear.  As with any Schwarzenegger film, there are plenty of one-liners to keep you laughing.

628557,5,6303313345,"True Lies is an action romp with several story lines that flow into each other for the big climax.  Harry (Arnold) and Helen (Jamie Lee) are in a stereotypical middle-class marriage where the husband is totally career focused and because he is ""successful"" he thinks all is well at home.  Helen is bored and miserable because she feels invisible to her husband.  Their daughter Dana (Eliza Dushku - Faith from Buffy) is alienated from them both and headed down a very bad path.
Harry has a secret life as a spy for a super secret government organization.  His partner is Albert (Tom Arnold in his best role / performance anywhere) and they are closer to each other than to anyone else in their lives as they travel the world saving us all from the bad guys.
The terrorism they are battling could have been ripped from today's headlines.  However, I doubt such a film could be made today because of political sensitivities.  I was surprised how much of it held up.
But this film is about fun more than drama.  The action is exciting, but preposterous and the scale of the action crescendos toward the final ridiculous aspect of Harry flying a Harrier jet while saving his daughter, fighting the big bad guy and fending off an attacking helicopter all at the same time.  Another problem, a small one for this kind of action film, is the endless weapons fire focused at the heroes to no effect, while Helen can simply drop a machine pistol down the stairs and wipe out a platoon.  It is a delightful seen, however.  If you can suspend disbelief for this, the movie can be a lot of fun.
Many have called the film misogynistic, and I suppose you can see some of that in the film.  But Bill Paxton's wonderful performance as the sleazebag Simon is easily the most despised person in the film and he is a male.
There are other find performances in the film.  Faisal, played wonderfully by Grant Heslov (we should see more of him), is a terrific character who holds a lot of the story line together even though his role isn't that large.  And Tia Carrere as the mercenary art dealer Juno is simply one of the best things in the movie.  Art Malik is great as the villain Salim Abu Aziz.  Mr. Malik provides the right kind of energy for such an over the top film.  He provides the kind of passionate megalomania that makes all the fighting seem appropriate.
With all the sub-plots weaving in and out, the humor, and the fine performances, I think this is one of Arnold Schwartzenegger's best films.  And I thought his pairing with Tom Arnold was great.  Too bad we never saw them together again.",1087776000,2,2585,4.52258064516129

However, I did not feel that way about the way Helen was depicted throughout.  She starts out as the hum-drum housewife--completely de-sexualized, and thus completely unfulfilled as a person.  It is only when she puts on some lipstick and tears the dress apart that she starts to feel excited about her life--as we can tell by the way she dances.  I feel like the movie is furthering stereotypes of boring housewives this way.  It's as though the message is to break out of line, get sexy-looking, and only then will you enjoy life.  It's clear that Helen comes to define herself by what men (i.e. Harry) see in her, because the last we see of her is the ballroom scene in a gown slit up almost to her hip putting lipstick on again.  Yes, Helen becomes comfortable with her sexuality.  This can be a good thing, but it is shown as the only avenue towards self-fulfillment.
Other than that, I did enjoy the humor of this movie.  So, if you can make yourself aware of the way that femininity is depicted throughout, then I'd say to go ahead and watch it.  Otherwise, caveat emptor.",1084233600,4,1184,4.435185185185185

628606,5,6303313345,"""True Lies"" is quite simply, one of the most entertaining, fast paced and hilarious films that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever starred in.  From the very first time I saw this movie in the theater to several viewings both in VHS and DVD format, I've found that the superior script and exceptional acting in this film entertains every time.  I've read of and heard many lament over some aspects of this film and the best I could say to those is that quite often the movies that Hollywood produces are a sensationalism of real life events and ultimately a movie such as this one is for entertainment not making statements about any one group or individual and as a medium for entertainment, this film succeeds completely!
Performance wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Tia Carrere and Art Malik all deserve great honors and the accolades they received for their respective parts in this film.  ""True Lies"" was probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best overall performance both in the action and the dramatic sense.  Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't have been any better in this role and I can honestly say that I was impressed with Tom Arnold's performance in this movie whereas any other film or show I've seen him in I was not impressed.  I believe the only other movie I've seen that Art Malik was in was ""The Living Daylights"" and in both that movie and this one his work has been exceptional.
Say what you may like about director James Cameron but you would definitely have to admit that prior to the current but most likely ""temporary"" culmination of his career as a director with the movie ""Titanic"" and heading off to run the ""Dark Angel"" television series, few directors could come close to matching his accomplishments.  ""True Lies"" was James Cameron's fifth highly successful hit in a row and with this movie and ""Titanic"" one could definitely say that during this run of box office hits, he had the pulse of the fans as he wrote screenplays and directed these extraordinary films.
The Premise:
Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a high speed ""spook"" working for a highly secretive government agency that is a watch dog/operator spook agency that identifies and handles terrorist threats to the United States.  Along with his handler Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold), they uncover a major terrorist operation which is bent on using nuclear warheads against the US to accomplish its goals.  As Harry, Albert and their organization are working to uncover the terrorists plot; his family becomes heavily involved in the story which is where Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis) comes in to play and some extremely hilarious scenes involving Simon (Bill Paxton).  What follows from there is one of the most hilarious and exciting action/drama films to have come out of the nineties.
I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in seeing a great, fast paced, highly intriguing and hilarious action/drama movie and aren't interested in reading too much into the plot or the characters in the plot that are used as plot devices.  {ssintrepid}

628664,5,6303313345,"Now might be a good time to check out ""True Lies"" once again, simply because most of the principles are in the news a lot these days.  After all, Arnold Swarzenegger is running for governor of California, Jamie Lee Curtis is getting great reviews for her work in the new version of ""Freaky Friday,"" a network has shown enough faith in Eliza Dushku to star her in a new television series ""Tru Calling,"" and Tom Arnold is hosting a sports talk show on television while being dissed by ex-wife Roseanne Barr as she prepares for her new reality show.  Of course, you have to wonder whatever happened to James Cameron, the director of this 1994 action comedy (my own guess is that the spirit of David O. Sleznick is whispering in Cameron's ear, ""Okay, now that you're `King of the World' what are you going to do next?"").
Arnold is Harry Tasker, a special agent for a super secret government organization, but his wife Helen (Curtis), thinks he is just a boring computer salesman.  While he is dealing with cracking a ring of international terrorists, she is looking for a little more excitement in her life.  Ironically, she thinks she has found this in a fast talking used car salesman who hits on lonely wives by pretending he is a secret agent.  Of course, the irony gets a bit more intense as the movie progresses and the chief attraction is that Harry is trying to save his marriage along with the free world.  If there is one lesson this film teaches, then it would clearly be the old adage that it takes two to tango.
This week my thinking is that ""True Lies"" is ultimate Arnold Swarzenegger film, combining the action of the ""Terminator"" films with the appealing comedy of ""Kindergarten Cop.""  This is a film that is able to have it both ways when it comes to Arnold's cinematic persona, being faithful to his larger than life action sequences while also carrying off some tongue-in-cheek parody.  Meanwhile, Curtis turns in the second best performance of her career, which I can now say because I just saw her best in ""Freaky Friday"" this afternoon.  Tom Arnold has never been better an the second banana, which is something he probably knows, and Charlton Heston has a choice bit part as the head of the secret organization for which Harry works.  I have heard there is supposed to be a sequel to this film, which might be derailed by Arnold's candidacy (especially if he gets elected), but that might be just as well because a sequel could not be better than the original in this case.
Schwarzenegger movies will be on hiatus, at least in California, for the next couple of months.  Fortunately, the movies of actors running for political office are a lot more accessible today than they were went Ronald Reagan was running for president (Note: ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" is a very good B-comedy and primarily a joke to those who have not seen the film).  If you are thinking of watching a Schwarzenegger movie to mull over his viability as a political candidate, then ""True Lies"" seems the obvious choice.  As for me, I watched it again because I wanted to see more of the funny (and sexy) Jamie Lee Curtis, and Laurie Strode just does not suffice any more.",1061078400,9,3158,4.607843137254902

628666,5,6303313345,"...I recently reviewed this film looking for misogyny and possible ways out of it, as presented in the film. There's more reasons to think that Cameron is trying to argue with sexism than endorse it. If you accept the logic of this film, you WILL love women.
First the sexist reasoning. Almost all of Tom Arnold's jokes come at the expense of women. The commonest one being that screwing a woman is to screw her over. Jamie-Lee Curtis, Arnold's wife, spends much of the film being a damselle in distress. And when she fights out of her predicament it's in a cat-fight with Tia Carrere. She's also interested in an affair with an ambiguously sexed love interest. The guy she wants to have an affair with is a used car dealer who listens to the Bee Gees and likes boys' behinds. And then there's the minor footnote of the time Arnold rides a horse into an elevator with an elderly couple. The little old lady is disgusted, frumpish and silly, as even the horse is smart enough to see when it smacks her face with its tail. The little old man husband meanwhile thinks Arnold's horse is swell. Moral: men have longer adolescences than women.
The anti-sexist stuff is there too in direct response to the misogyny. JLC really does fight her way out of her trap. And when Arnold saves her, she grasps his arm as vigorously as he does her's. Arnold's daughter becomes the damselle in disress in the end. (SPOILER WARNING: SEE THE FILM BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER.) But she singlehandedly prevents Miami from being nuked. And at the close of the film Arnold has a great time clowning around with his wife and daughter.
Cameron is offering a thought experiment: What if all the utterly sexist thoughts which flit through young men's minds are true? What if women really are confused at best and silly at worst? What if their beauty is only skin deep? And what if their devotion can easily fray? Say all that is true. Can you still love them? The answer is one that any good New Age guru is going to accept: you can because women are FUN.
(There's also a hint that the film is really a personal piece of art when the Arab terrorist directs himself in a video warning to the US.)
Please, Jim! Come back to action! No one else does it as good as you! Just treat us worker ants like we're the alpha males and we'll follow you every time!",1057104000,,2319,4.458823529411765

628668,5,6303313345,"Before Spetember 11, no one would have figured James Cameron was a prophet. Same for Tom Clancy. But where Clancy, who does something similar in The Sum of All Fears, has as his hero ubernerd Jack Ryan, INTJ, Cameron has as his hero the far more fun and accessible ESTP Arnold. Imagine James Bond written by alpha-male Americans for alpha-male Americans, instead of the cool and dry diehard Brit Ian Fleming. (To see what these tags of character's mean go to keirsey.com, which explains the whole business of INTJ's or ESTP's eloquently and simply.)
The Amazon writeup for this film implies Cameron doesn't like women. But Jamie Lee Curtis does look to be having fun. Yes, us men are going ga-ga for her as she is exploited. But (a) she raked in a heap of money (b) her stunning body has been immortalized in film and (c) how many women can claim to have turned on so many men at the same time with so little effort? (Hint: Curtis may very well be an alpha-female. Maybe and ENTJ.)
The action sequences in this film, as in all Cameron films, have a serious true-to-life feel. Arnold may very well be a psychopath as he slaughters deranged terrorist after deranged terrorist utterly without remorse or even blinking an eye. But the way it's done you really get the feeling that the violence is essential to the story and had to be done this way. (Again, unlike Sum of All Fears, which is a major letdown once you know anything about plotting. Why is the leader of The Greatest Nation on Earth not levelheaded?  The story's suspense derives entirely from the US President acting like a nincompoop. Which speaks well neither towards Clancy the democrat nor Clancy the patriot.) Which is why Cameron is better than Sam Peckinpah, who filmed Tarkovsky-like action sequences that often seemed out of place.
There's also enough gadgetry in this film to keep the editors of Maxim busy for at least a year. The subbasement of the building Arnold and co-star Tom Arnold work in is a standout true geek heaven. Cameron really delivers the goods.
Let's just hope he stops trying to grow up with this Titanic stuff and returns to the his teenage boy roots. He's in a league of his own.",1054339200,,2172,4.626943005181347

his best buddy, Tom Arnold from ""Roseanne"" fame, is the perfect comic foil. It's really Tom that makes this act/adv stand out from the crowd. The dialogue is fast, funny, and Tom takes it to the limit.

He has made a few movies that can be forgotten, and some that may be remembered. I think True Lies is his best movie, for several reasons. The storyline of the movie is quite simple: secret agent discovers some bad guys (and a good looking bad woman) and chases them in an spectacular style (ever see a Hawker Harrier land on the highway?). Director and production team had a good vision on how to give the public what they wanted to tell: some suspense, some violence and a lot of action, but sure enough more laughs than you might expect. Although much of the action scenes are highly exaggerated in various ways, this movie might be the landmark on big action scenes that do look very realistic. At that time the digital domain wasn't as good as it is nowadays but it does the job. The scene in which a truck with baddies is shot off a bridge with a rocket launched from a helicopter is legendary.

628727,4,6303313345,"James Cameron reteamed with Schwarzenegger in one of the big man's last good action films of late, where Arnie is secret agent Harry Tasker with Jamie Lee Curtis as his unassuming wife who thinks he's a sale rep. This isn't one of Cameron's best, but it's still a cracking action film that has enough stunts, explosions and witty one-liners to fill a dozen Bond films.
The film, based on the french film ""Le Totale!"", is Cameron easing up on his usual gung-ho heroics and bringing some humour hirthero unseen in the Cameron cannon. The pairing of witty Tom Arnold and Arnie is great, and the halarious Bill Paxton as the under-endowed used-car salesman who tricks Tasker's wife (Curtis) into going on a ""mission"" with him. And of course, the buxom Curtis, who brings a leval of sexyness to the whole thing, has one of her best roles since the old slasher films she starred in in the 80's.
The action ante is impressive, and near the end we see Cameron's M.O resurface, with some incredible explosions and the big man's increasingly large arsenal along the way. It's very fun, very cool, and a must-have for any action fan. Dissapointing DVD extras with only a trailer, one hopes a re-release will come along soon...",1025827200,,1215,4.708920187793427

Harry Renquist (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a US federal agent working for an agency whose very existence is denied. His own wife, Helen Tasker, (Jamie Lee Curtis) thinks that he is Harry Tasker, a rather boring computer salesman and that, when he is off saving the world, he is merely trying to sell a few computers to a foreign company.
He is perhaps a little too boring for Helen and she is just beginning to get involved with Simon (Bill Paxton) a used car salesman who is pretending to be a spy when her husband finds out and attempts to use the resources of his department to keep tabs on the two of them.
Meanwhile, his current assignment, an investigation into a Mid East terrorist group led by Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik) begins to become tangled up with his domestic affairs. With the help of Juno Skinner (Tia Carrere) an art dealer specialising in Persian antiquities, Aziz smuggles a batch of ex Soviet nuclear warheads into Florida. His plan is to detonate one as a demonstration and then to hold the US to ransom. As a sideline, he decides that he must kidnap and interrogate Renquist who has been getting a little too close in his investigation. That leaves Renquist/Tasker and his wife on an island with a soon to be detonated bomb and three other warheads headed off across the country.
Of course, you already know that Arnie will save the day and square things with his wife but plot and story line are really just a convenient peg on which to hang some gloriously indulgent action sequences.
As far as it goes, the acting is really all about Schwarzenegger and Curtis. Everyone else is pretty much incidental. Arnie strides through the action sections with his normal aplomb but he falls down badly when he is playing the part of the cuckolded husband. In that mode he is unconvincing. Curtis too is a bit of a let down. She seems to be walking rather woodenly through most of the film though she does wake up when she gets involved in the action. Art Malik does a decent job in the not too demanding role of Aziz the master terrorist. However Tia Carrere just hams it up too far in her role as Juno Skinner the beautiful but evil sidekick. None of this matters though as we are watching this film to see Arnie try to ride a horse off a skyscraper and rescue his daughter with a Harrier jet fighter.
There is action aplenty and the movie just keeps dishing it up. It it one of the few films that has actually made this reviewer's pulse rate rise. This movie does not let the audience catch  its breath. The stunts themselves are splendid. Of course they are almost universally implausible but they work.
As an action movie, this is about as good as it gets. The pace is sometimes a little frantic but as escapist enjoyment the film is a hit.",1012003200,,3027,4.493647912885662

Well, every time I fire one up on the DVD machine, I break out my two little analog hand-held clicker-counters (one for the heavies, which tends to overheat quickly, & one for the good guys, which usually collects more dust than digits) to keep track of the body count! Pretty extreme, huh? Sadly, most of my fanboy buds think my keeping track of the survival-challenged is kinda pathetic. But they're just jealous 'cause they don't know all the lines to every 'Dirty Harry' sequel like I do! Yeah, who's the pathetic one NOW, you posers?
Anyway, on with the review. I found 'True Lies' to be yet another memorable actioner from the mind of a guy who's no slouch when it comes to the action/adventure genre. His writing and/or producing and/or direction of such memorable shoot-em-up fare as 'Rambo II', 'Aliens', and the two 'Terminator' flicks will attest to this fact. When it comes to flyin' metal and/or energy-based projectiles, nukes goin' off, pioneering new computer-generated imagery techniques, blue-filtered night scenes, and utilizing spare-no-expense budgets to their maximum potential, James Cameron is a filmmaking god!
'True Lies' is one of the best examples of comic-book-style action cinema around, with a little bit of James Bond thrown in for good measure. It doesn't disappoint in providing those moments of pure implausible silliness that action flicks have in spades, and then some! The best example of this being the discharge of the MAC 10 (or was it a MAC 9? Uzi? I'm not sure) taking out a dozen Middle-Eastern terrorists as it rolls down a stairway. Talk about a hair trigger! Then there's our main baddie Aziz doin' the cross-skyscraper motorcycle jump. The pelican that literally tips the scales against the terrorists gained a pretty hearty guffaw from my ample belly. And when Aziz gets his-- well, you'll hafta see it for yourself. (Hee hee... 'You're fired'... I get it! Bwahhh-hah-hah-haaa!)
Now it's time for a little feature I try to include in all of my video reviews- the disclosure of the big flub. Although most of the CGI & matte work done here isn't as absolutely convincing as it could be, overall I found it to work fairly well. But there is one moment where the 'seams' in the magic can be perceived, albeit only very slightly with careful inspection. It happens following the opening at the Swiss lakeside mansion. When Arn's making his climb up to the top floor from the second-story terrace, there's a barely-perceivable shift in the height of the wall he's scaling. I never noticed this on VHS before; the superior picture clarity of DVD makes the moment a bit more apparent. Just goes to show you that the digital video format isn't all it's cracked up to be...
But, at least the movie has some pretty good comedic elements to get my mind off its shortcomings. Although I'm no big fan of Tom Arnold, I thought he did a pretty good job in his role as Arn's backup man. And of course Bill Paxton's at it again, playing the kind of part he's good at- a smarmy, oily, cowardly little git. Although I thought his character's posing-as-a-secret-agent-to-pick-up-chicks schtick was rather unconvincing, he definitely steals the show in the comedy department. His 'little' revelation at the aqueduct is one of those great comedic moments I like to rewind and watch three times in a row before I let the movie play on.
Aside from the myriad CGI renderings & bluescreen moments that didn't always fit, my only gripe with this disc is this: there's almost no extras or bonus material. Just one theatrical trailer's included, and that's it. Now normally this wouldn't bother me too much, but this is a James Cameron flick we're talking about here. When was the last time you recall one of his big-budget/big-studio films NOT getting the fully loaded treatment on DVD?
(brief pause)
Yeah, see what I mean? Oh sure, 'The Abyss', 'Aliens', 'Terminator 2', and-coming soon- the original 'Terminator'- all get their just respects on the digital format: restored footage, running commentary tracks, trailers, endless behind-the-scenes looks, ete., etc., ad nauseum. Heck, even 'Titanic' has more extras. But when it comes to loadin' up 'True Lies', does it get any consideration? No! What it gets is a swift kick to the curb! If ever there was a Rodney Dangerfield among the Jimmy-C blockbuster series, this is it!
Then again, it's highly likely that Fox is goin' for the DVD double-dip. You know the scene: they offer you this stripped-down model, and being one of those 'I-just-gotta-have-it!' type DVD nuts, naturally you buy it. Then a few months to a few years later, the studio rolls out the Super-Duper-Top-Of-The-Line 2-disc version with all the bells, whistles & assorted tchotchkes! Hey, it worked for the 'Die Hard' trilogy, right?
Anyway, I gotta go. I've a few other Arnie flicks cued up for viewing, & my clicker-counter's gettin' anxious...

628826,5,6303313345,"Many men like me enjoy action or adventure movies. And many women enjoy instead romantic movies or comedies. Here we have a film that combines both. I watched it with my wife and we both enjoyed it (usually, given our different tastes, only one of us really enjoys a movie...) This is due to the fact that there is first quite some comedy in the movie, as Schwarzenegger's wife, who seems to be a serious and boring person, gets embarked on an affair with a guy who pretends to be a spie...  I enjoyed the scenario with its many funny plays (e. g. the way  Schwarzenegger, a real spie, handles the affair), and the many surprises (which I do not want to reveal...). And there were good jokes (e. g. when the terrorist hangs on a rocket, and Schwarzie says ""You're fired!...""- and fires the rocket), plus of course a lot of good action that builds up in the second half of the movie (without blood in spite of the dead Schwarzenegger scores.) Probably the fact that the movie has a great director (Cameron) makes the film such a success.
Another good thing is that the bad guys - some Arab terrorists  - are not too badly stereotyped, and they even get a chance to express their viewpoint and show  some qualities (willingness to sacrifice oneself). I am saying this because I hated a movie - Delta Force - with Chuck Norris where Arabs and Palestinians are awfully depicted, with extreme disrespect and stupid prejudices  la Hollywood.

I would recommend this movie as a good fun movie for both you and your spouse / partner. (But as I understand from some other reviewers, feminists may not like the movie for the way Schwarzenegger handles his wife in certain sequences - they don't understand it is meant as fun - Schwarzenegger does that kind of things in all his movies, he does not mean things seriously like Stallone does seem to. Anyway my wife who is no feminist enjoyed greatly these ""controversial"" sequences. ) But this sort of fun movie is not the kind I like to see and see again, I mean those movies that make you dream (like Milius' Conan the Barbarian, with Schwarzenegger) or that are very deep (like Boorman's Excalibur).",992822400,4,2239,4.532178217821782

628830,5,6303313345,"Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton and Tom Arnold dazzle in this action adventure thrill ride of movie from director James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2, Aliens).  Jim Cameron had a real turn around from his usual Sci-Fi thriller films to an action comedy, which he later followed up on with a different genre of a film- the suspenseful romance drama- Titanic which was said to be one of the greatest films all around.  SCHWARZENEGGER again teams up with JAMES CAMERON for the third time around, following up their past projects together, TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY.  Adding to the team are funnyman Tom Arnold, HALLOWEEN'S Jamie Lee Curtis, and James Cameron's great friend Bill Paxton who's worked with Jim Cameron (Terminator, Aliens, Titanic) and Arnold (Terminator, Commando, True Lies) a few times.  The plot of this film was not too typical for its time of 1994, but it is a similar to a James Bond film or Mission: Impossible- the only thing is, it's better than all of them!  It shows you spies and action adventure like you have never seen before!  This movie has got lots of action, romance and comedy!!!  I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is looking for a good time!",983232000,2,1228,4.84688995215311
628831,4,6303313345,"Arnold Schwarzenegger might very well be the only Republican I can stand to watch for the duration of a two plus hour film.  He's funny, intellegent, well spoken and consistently churns out some of the best action movies around.  Much of this success can be attributed to his partnership with Titanic director James Cameron, who's provided him with some his best material to date in the 1994 action/comedy True Lies.
In it he plays Harry Tasker, a spy posing as a computer salesman to his wife and daughter, which is a funny concept in it of itself, let alone to have the Terminator cast in the title role.  But what's so remarkable about his performance is that he does an astonishingly convincing job of passing himself off as an oafish slug.  Yet even despite the domesticated way in which he presents himself to his family, it doesn't diminish his credibility as an intellegence agent, thanks in large part to his commanding presence which is never too far from the surface.
The action gets off to a rousing start with a white knuckled opening sequence that's sure to leave you breathless.  After a short break to develop the characters and the situation we're thrown back in the fray with a chase through the city streets of DC, leading from malls to parks and eventually winding up on the roof of the Mariott.  It's really quite spectacular.
Of course, they can't maintain this frenetic pace for long, so James Cameron makes the smooth transition into comedy with the introduction of Bill Paxton as a mystery man named Simon.  You see, Simon's trying to bait Harry's wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), into an affair.  Little does he know that this ""bored housewife"" is married to a spy who after overhearing her talk about him to a coworker puts the full wait of the CIA (or whatever agency it is that he works for) behind investigating their relationship.  Sure it's ""a misappropriation of government resources,"" as Tom Arnold chimes in, but when a movie's this much fun you don't question it's plausibility.
The laughs keep coming for about an hour when the seamless transition is made back into action.  The story somehow manages to shift into a plot involving Arab terrorists without disrupting the flow of the movie.  The terrorists threaten to blow up one major US city each week until we withdraw our troops from the Persian Gulf.  Its seems a reasonable request given the fact that we're not doing much good over there, but I won't get into that here.
The terrorists are as sterotypical as ever which Cameron tries to counteract by adding a few token minorities, who serve no real purpose but are nice window dressing for 20th Century Fox.  I suppose we've been spoiled by David O. Russell's groundbreaker Three Kings, which for the first time in a long time shed the Arab community in a primarily positive light.  But I can't very well hold this against a Schwarzenegger film which has no other purpose than to entertain, and it does.
Kudos to Tom Arnold as the wisecracking sidekick to Arnold's action hero role, and Jamie Lee Curtis who has never been more believeable than she is here as a frumpy housewife.  But the performance that resonates most with me was from Bill Paxton, showing an inclination towards comedy in one of his best roles to date.  As for Arnie, he does a nice job chewing on the scenery, delivering what lines he's given, but his performance is so rooted in his screen persona that I can't imagine anyone else being able to pull it off.
This is the type of movie I wish James Cameron would revert back to.  One with modest ambitions, not overwrought with sentimentality (or arrogance) like Titanic, but a whole hearted summer blockbuster that knows what it is and delivers.",982886400,2,3710,4.718266253869969
628832,5,6303313345,"Arnold Schwarzenegger simply refuses to take himself seriously.  Who else could have made  Twins or Junior after that string of muscle films?  Recently, he seems to approach film making  with an air of wry amusement.  And that's very good for us, because with True Lies, he's  achieved an almost unqualified success.  This film is a collector's item for repeated  enjoyment.
Combatting terrorists has taken a grip on the American psyche.  Big Arnie is a counter  espionage agent who acts as a ""software salesman"" to his family.  The dual role keeps him at  the sharp end some of the time, but concerned father and devoted husband the rest.  His wife  is a legal secretary and effective housewife, arranging for repairs, rearing their daughter and doing  the laundry.  It's a pretty dull existence on the surface.  She needs excitement, while her  husband is experiencing almost as much of that as he can handle.
As a James Bond character one moment and a middle class husband and father the next,  Schwarzenegger displays a capacity unexpressed in his early films.  His narrow escapes and  rapid role changes are carried with suave assurance unseen in his earlier work.  In this film  he's able to carry off a variety of identities without missing a beat.  Even when he reverts to  his earlier smash 'em and crash 'em scenes, he manages it with full recognition of the role.  It's  not mindless, meaningless violence, but with the full characterization of the supposedly  betrayed husband.
Tom Arnold, as his fellow agent and backup turns in a superb performance.  As the ""older  and wiser"" long-time sufferer of failed marriages and director of Schwarzenegger's  clandestine operations, he comes through with a fine display of wit.  He's a born humourist  and brings that talent to a fine pitch here.  The other major male character, Art Malik is simply  indescribable.  You'd never believe him to be a native of the UK, he comes across as fresh  from Iraq, Iran or out of Khaddafi's stable.  He's a consummate terrorist leader right to the  end.  Bill Paxton, a used car dealer posing as an agent to pick up women, outdoes anything  he's shown us before.  It must have been a tough role to play, given the handling he receives  from Schwarzenegger.  He's despicable, but carries that image through in good style.
Giving all the male actors in this film sufficient accolades isn't hard.  They all perform without  serious flaws.  This film, however, is picked up and walked away with by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Starting as a stodgy secretary-housewife, she moves into an almost romance with Paxton.  ""Rescued"" by Schwarzenegger's team, she moves into an entirely new role for her.  The hotel  scene with Big Arnie must have given the Hollywood censors some uncomfortable moments  in trying to rate this film.  It would be fascinating to know if Jamie's ""breakout"" from her  previously roles was really due to James Cameron or if she entered into the spirit of the thing  on her own hook.  It's certainly difficult to imagine Cameron sitting off to one side shouting  positions for Curtis to assume during the hotel scene.
The performances given in this film far outweigh the action sequences, stunning as they are.  We can get all we want of that watching the James Bond flicks without ever seeing this level  of characterizations.  This film cries out for a sequel, particularly given the closing scene.  Curtis, transformed by her exotic experiences following the revelation of what Big Arnie  actually does for a living are superb.  A good follow-up would be a perfect cap to what we  view in this, the best of many of the performers here.",982713600,,3638,4.879934210526316

628863,4,6303313345,"I'll let the rest of the reviews speak for the quality and plot of the movie.
The DVD is just average. Although there are great animated menus, there just isn't anything special. It's presented in widescreen, with a good 5.1 mix, as well as subtitles and a few different languages. Bass response during explosions and gunshots were strangely low, with the music score overpowering most of the action scenes.
However, the only special feature is a single theatrical trailer. If you watch the movie and then watch the trailer, you'll notice scenes and dialouge in the trailer that isn't even in the movie!
The sole addition of these obviously ""deleted"" (and rather amusing) scenes and quips from Tom Arnold would make this DVD purchase much better. A director or actor commentary from what was obviously not just a ""little action movie"" would also add to it's value. For it's above average price you'd expect a little more.
Although True Lies probably doesn't deserve the full Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition treatment, it's a shame because Cameron has been so responsive with his other DVD editions, like Aliens and The Abyss.",980208000,,1123,4.947089947089947

  James Cameron (of TITANIC and TERMINATOR 2 fame) directed and scripted this thriller. Cameron used the classic ""Arnold Movie Formula"" of tongue-in-cheek humour, and stunning action to craft the picture. The plot is believable and moves swiftly thanks to Cameron's talent as a screenwriter/director. A fine cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and Charlton Heston (his cameo was all too brief)add to making the film great.

Their delightfully comic  transformations (particularly hers) inject a very human spirit into this  wonderfully engaging spy/action/triller, which is not at all what you might  expect from the pre-Titanic James Cameron.  Bill Paxton is hilarious, and  Tom Arnold, of all people, actually shines in his comic turn as Arnie's  superslueth sidekick.

Jamie Lee Curtis as Arnold's  unsuspecting wife is just great.  She can play both the vulnerable  housewife and the hard as nails woman protecting herself...plus she can  scream really well!  The chemistry between her and Arnold onscreen is  great.
The comedy in this movie is great.  Tom Arnold plays Arnold's  partner and just gets walked all over by him.  Has to take all the abuse  and cruddy jobs...just hilarious.  Then there's Bill Paxton's bit role as a  sleazy car salesman.  He does an unbelievably funny job.

628905,4,6303313345,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's last film (""End of Days"") was a disappointment to most of his fans.  Much better was this 1994 slam-bam action fest.  It is one of the best movies in the Ahnuld canon.  It is also  an exciting, sometimes hilarious film that should satisfy the appetites of  action fans everywhere.
Arnold stars as Harry Tasker, a mild-mannered,  milquetoast computer salesman--or so his wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis)  believes.  Actually, he's a superspy for Omega Sector, a shadowy government  intelligence agency.
Harry has been spying for seventeen years along with  his wisecracking sidekick Gib (Tom Arnold).  They go into the most  dangerous, thrilling situations possible.  At the same time, Helen  complains about how boring Harry is, always in sales meetings or dull  conferences.  All she wants is a little adventure in her life.  Be careful  what you wish for!
Writer-director James Cameron outdid himself with this  one, delivering over-the-top action and special FX like only he can.  (Yes,  I did like this better than ""Titanic.""  Much better.)  Some of  the sequences in this film are nothing short of amazing.  They really do  have to be seen to be believed.
Schwarzenegger shows off his  always-improving acting skills, even going so far as to tango, a trick he  never would have tried a few years ago.  He's no Pacino, maybe, but he's  not half-bad.  Schwarzenegger's presence holds the film together, providing  a veneer of believability in the midst of all the cartoon violence.
Tom  Arnold is refreshingly good in the comic second banana role, all but  stealing the film from the principals.  Having cast off the mantle of  ""Roseanne's husband,"" Arnold shows himself to be a gifted and  likable performer in his own right.
Jamie Lee Curtis is as sexy and smart  as always.  Her role is somewhat awkward, as she is forced to endure some  fairly embarrassing moments.  She plays them, though, with verve and guts  and accords herself well.
I do have one major complaint about ""True  Lies.""  It's too long and the second act lags.  With a running time of  two hours and twenty-one minutes, there are unavoidable lulls in the story.  The scipt, as written, just can't support this much movie.  Some judicious  editing would have solved this.

628925,4,6303313345,"This film is entertaining all the way through, it starts out great, then slows down enough to make us laugh a little then takes of full-speed for it's action-packed finale. Great for die-hard action fans. The best  Cameron-Schwarzenegger movie outside the 'Terminator' flicks. Really worth  your while. Different from the normal action flick, a little different, a  little better. Jamie Lee Curtis is great in this movie and I think  Schwarzenegger gives his best performance here. But this is James Cameron's  movie all the way. From 1-10 I give it a 7.",950745600,,554,4.978260869565218
628926,1,6303313345,"I've always been ambivalent about the movies of James Cameron. (It doesn't help that for all of the success of his films, Cameron comes across in his interviews as a self-absorbed egomaniac.) Okay, ""Aliens"" was a  decent sequel, and the Terminator films were terrifically exciting action  flicks, but Cameron's films (""Titanic"" being a notable exception)  always felt like they relied on their big bangs to make people stay in  their seats. Cameron's films were big and empty . . . that special  something was lacking. ""True Lies"" is a perfect example of  Cameron's emptiness.
The plot? Arnold is an agent working for a secret  intelligence organization combating terrorism, while his wife (Jamie Lee  Curtis) labors under the belief that her husband is a boring 9-to-5  white-collar office guy. Ultimately, in foiling a plot by an Islamic  terrorist group to blow up a U.S. city with a nuke, Arnold gets Jamie mixed  up in his work and must save the U.S. while he saves his marriage, blah  blah blah . . . . Let's not mince words. This is a pretty lousy  movie.
Where to begin? The worst part of this movie was in Arnold's  treatment of his wife, whom he kidnaps and forces to pretend to be a  prostitute. If Arnold really loved his wife why would he subject her to  such a humiliating and perilous ordeal? It's disappointing that Cameron,  whose previous films featured strong heroines (""Terminator 2"",  ""Aliens""), makes Jamie Lee Curtis into such a victim here. And I  also laughed at the scene where, after they escape the terrorists, she  kisses him while a nuclear explosion engulfs a Caribbean island behind  them. The scene was:
A) stupid . . . honestly now, if any guy actually  forced their wife to pretend to be a prostitute as a trick and she found  out they'd be a dead man. And,
B) it was just plain corny
The movie's  curious mix of humor and over-the-top action comes off pretty poorly too.  The opening sequence featuring Arnold in a tux looked silly. I kept waiting  for the joke, thinking Cameron was doing a parody of Mission: Impossible at  first.
The action was pretty over-wrought as well. I enjoyed the action  Director John Woo put in ""Face/Off"" for its ballet-esque style  and skill. It was over-the-top sure, but it had style and grace and didn't  try to take itself seriously. In ""True Lies"" Cameron was trying  to say ""Can you top this?"" More killing! More explosions! More  mayhem! More loud noises! Cameron has no finesse, no style as a Director.  This movie is all brawn and no brain.
People have also criticized  ""True Lies"" for being anti-Arab, for its portrayal of Islamic  terrorism with his bad guys, the ""Crimson Jihad"". There is merit  to that criticism, but my biggest beef with Cameron's choice of villains is  their blandness. The leader of these guys snarls and looks nasty and beats  on women, but is a pretty wooden bad guy.
Critics have also lambasted the  movie for its violence (in 1995 Presidential candidate Bob Dole blasted  Hollywood for making anti-social movies and suggested ""True Lies""  was a ""family friendly"" film. Arnold's status as a GOP fundraiser  and the cameo by now-NRA President Charlton Heston may have affected his  analysis more than anything else). Again, there is merit here. The action  is bloody and jarring in ""Face/Off"", but the action is more meant  to upset us than anything else. ""True Lies"" is a glorification of  killing and mayhem. Arnold kills someone, whips off a snippy line and keeps  going. Pretty disturbing.
So was there anything I liked about ""True  Lies""? Sure, I kinda liked Tom Arnold's role as Arnold's sidekick. He  was pretty funny.
Watching ""True Lies"" I'm reminded of  Shakespeare. This is a movie with much sound and fury, and it signifies  nothing. Big, loud, and empty to the core.",949968000,10,3781,4.775541795665634
628927,1,6303313345,"Saw it in theater and thought it great. Enjoyed it on VHS, but was so disappointed with the sound and picture quality (or lack thereof) on DVD, I returned it to place of purchase and got my money back.  Based on customer  reviews, I wonder if I got a bad copy.  The opening scenes were terrific  picture-wise, but for the rest, I had to keep the remote handy to  constantly correct flesh tones, and the sound quality was no better than  what I heard on VHS.",945043200,10,457,4.255813953488372

I like Arnold, but this wasn't his best work.  But hey, he's  buff, he's got the cool accent, he can shoot a gun, who really cares,  right?  The highlight of the movie is the beautiful and talented Eliza  Dushku, only twelve years old in this movie (her character is 14, but she  was 12 when they filmed it).  One of the two flaws is that she didn't have  enough screen time.  Come on, 140 minutes, and you can only squeeze her  into three scenes??  The time is the other problem.  It dragged on a  little.  But other than that, it's a great movie.  See it!!!!!!!  4.5 stars",939513600,,727,4.13768115942029
628948,3,6303313345,"TRUE LIES hinges on stupidity rather than wit: Jamie Lee Curtis does not know what her husband does for a living and does not even recognize him when he is a few feet away.  That moronic element of the picture drags down  what could have otherwise been a pretty nifty action flick, although I  would nonetheless see it again.  Comic actor Tom Arnold upstages Arnold  Schwarzenegger, no small feat.  Director James Cameron definitely packages  some excitement in TRUE LIES, but it left me feeling that Cameron and  Schwarzenegger were resting on their TERMINATOR laurels.",936230400,,570,4.98936170212766

628982,2,6303313345,"Mild escapist fun.  Only worth a look if you haven't seen it.
There are some good sequences and FX (a bridge blowing up, excellent missile effects) but overall the drama feels stilted, plodding.  In particular  there is a really slow fifteen to twenty minutes when the main character  chooses to interrogate his wife.  In the theater it was painful.  At least  on DVD you can just hit skip.
The humor is decidedly lowbrow.  The Bill  Paxton subplot did not work as well as intended.  To misquote Paul Thomas  Anderson, ""Little dick jokes.  I don't know.""
Also, the villain  was fairly weak, and the green screen composites in the final sequence just  look like shoddy work.",927072000,,673,4.739130434782608
7843776,3,6303313345,This is a pretty good movie.  I would say it is at least one of my top four Schwarzenegger movies.  It's like most of his movies there is plenty of action with some humor thrown in.  One of the most memorable scenes I have scene in any movie is when he rides the horse in the elevator.  It also has one of the best roles for Jamie Lee Curtis as she goes from being his mousy wife to being pretty tough herself.  And there are a lot of good scenes beside the horse.  There is a climax with a helicopter.  This just a good all around action movie.,1524787200,,545,3.990740740740741
