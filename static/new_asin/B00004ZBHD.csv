8344590,4,B00004ZBHD,it's a hilarious movie.  you have to have the right mindset when you watch this movie.  it's a cross between a ninja movie and an unconventional porno.,1088985600,,151,4.555555555555555
8344591,4,B00004ZBHD,"Despite the fact that most people tend to think this movie is really terrible, I am forced to disagree. This movie is a giant spoof. Every character in the movie is a legitimate, historical (though hardly accurate) individual. If you research them, you can find accounts of most of their lives with minimal difficulty. The actual scenes are outright parodies of dramatic scenes from other samurai and Japanese horror movies; most notable is the final battle between Musashi and Jubei (the protagonist) on the beach. Don't take this movie seriously and you'll enjoy it.",1046131200,4,568,5.053191489361702
8344592,4,B00004ZBHD,"I think that this movie is like an anime movie: blood, sex and inexplicable things, the sword play are pretty good although I didn't like special effects, the performance of Jubei is excellent and I could say that it is the best along the movie.",1038096000,,245,4.466666666666667
8344593,3,B00004ZBHD,"I don't think ""Samurai Armageddon"" is that bad, there was some pretty good samurai swordplay throughout the movie although I would've preferred more. Still, the story behind this movie was just terrible, and way too perverted to be a samurai movie. Damn did you see that thing that lady had on her crotch, and what she did with it was just nasty!! Total turnoff. If your looking for an average samurai flick with twisted scenes in between. This might be the one your looking for.",988416000,,479,4.647058823529412
