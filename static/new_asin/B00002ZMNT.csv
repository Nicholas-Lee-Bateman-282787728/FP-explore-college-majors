7916320,3,B00002ZMNT,"This 1947 movie is a remake of the 1938 picture with the same name and starring George O'Brien .Both versions claim to be based on the Zane Grey novel also entitled Thunder Mountain but in reality both are only tenuously linked to the book and they have virtually nothing in common with the novel other than its title .

Tim Holt plays a young man returning home to Arizona after studying at an Eastern agricultural college only to discover that the family ranch is facing foreclosure and that his neighbours with whom there has been a long standing feud are still in no mood to forgive .He is warned off by two of their number and must also find $6000 if the ranch is not to be sold at auction. What he and his neighbours do not know is that the land has been earmarked for a major development project and is worth an absolute fortune .The two villains -played by  Richard Powers(aka Tom Keene )and Harry Woods -know this and are desperate to ensure they buy the land .They try to kill Holt and Martha Hyer ,the head of the neighbouring family and also to frame Holt for murdering her brother (Steve Brodie) .Holt fights back with the aid of his sottish attorney -a winning cameo from Jason Robards Senior .In the midst of the gunpaly and fisticuffs a relationship develops between Holt and Hyer
This is formulaic but briskly made B Movie action and will appeal to lovers of vintage Westerns .It is not a major work being made as a programme filler in 1947 but if you take it for what it is then it will pass an enjoyable hour or so",1194220800,,1533,4.375438596491228
