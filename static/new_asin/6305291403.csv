By the end of the film you will be pondering the meaning of  your own. This movie is superior to almost every other.  If you enjoy it  you should also try to find a copy of the American film, Trip to Bountiful  which covers some of the same themes and is also very well done.",929750400,,431,4.2073170731707314

Massimo Troisi is unforgettably good as Mario Ruopollo, a simple minded yet ambitious postman who falls for the village beauty (Maria Grazi Cucinotta). However, in order to win her love  and find some sort of escape from the mundane life he believes the island  holds, Mario enlists the help of exiled Chilian poet Pablo Neruda (Phillipe  Noiret). This film remains in my heart for various reasons, none more  poignant than the mere fact thats its storytelling at its very best.  Profound, moving and thoughprovoking. Il Postino is one film that makes you  believe once again in the power and magic of Cinema.",923788800,3,645,4.871559633027523

The Poetry of Il Postino
This story was about a man named Mario Ruoppolo that gets a job as a postman. He doesn't  get much pay doing the job but he was fine with it. One  of his daily customers is Mister Pablo Neruda who is a well known poet. This story took place in a small island town in Mediterranean Sea.  Mario was the sun a Fisher man that wanted Mario to keep the family tradition and do fishing as he did but Mario didn't like Fishing.  Everyday when Mario gets to deliver Mister Neruda mail he tries to get closer to him by asking him questions about his poetry. He even asked him if he could have his book signed by Pablo Neruda. As soon as Pablo begins to know Mario he likes him and introduces him to the world of poetry. Mario falls in love with Beatrice . Mario asks Pablo for help to get her attention. Mario begins to lure Beatrice with his poetry .  Beatrice like it too, but the aunt Donna Rosa his kind of upset thinking that Mario has bad intentions with his niece but with time they all see that he doesn't have any bad intentions. Later on they get married and are happy . I thought this movie was so romantic at first i thought it was going to be boring but i actually enjoyed watching and reading the subtitles i didn't get to see the last 30 minutes but i do look forward in watching it.  Would i recommend it to others yes i would definitely recommend it . Loved it :)",1429315200,,1409,4.124087591240876

The painstakingly developed story of the illiterate Postman seeking beauty in his life and finding it in the words and friendship of the famous poet Pablo Neruda is exquisite.  Through the Poet's infinite patience, the depth and insight of his ""words"" allowed the Postman to see that the beauty that he was looking for actually surrounded him.  Plus, through those very same words -- find love and self-respect.  I watched the movie, separately, with each one of my five grandchildren, hoping that the beautiful values it taught would find a home in their hearts--as it did mine.",1414108800,,640,4.898148148148148

This one is about using the romantic poetry of Pablo Neruda to woo the young woman he is in love with. You will be enthralled by how wonderful this movie is. I can't get enough of it - and the soundtrack is out of this world - buy it separately and hear artists like Sting, Bono, Glen Close, Madonna, Samuel L. Jackson, Ethan Hawke, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia and others recite Pablo Neruda's poetry - gorgeous, just gorgeous.

I believe that someone's thoughts are more important than their actions because thoughts are what determine how you act, preform, and what you say. In order words, they determine whether you act negatively, or positively. In this movie, after being influenced by Pablo Neruda, Mario's shy/negative thoughts were converted to courageous/positive thoughts; he had attained enough courage to talk to, and write poems to his love. *SPOILER ALERT* In the end, Mario and his love get married, thanks to the influence Pablo Neruda had on him.

Il Postino apparently tries to continue the neorealist genre and proves that neorealism is best left to the neorealists of the 1950s.  To begin with, the movie is in color and color somehow doesn't do well with neorealism.

But the main problem is the movie itself.  The main theme is about a simple man in a simple village on a simple Italian island which was visited by a famous South American Marxist poet.  The main character overdoes the simple theme to the extent that he comes off one level above acute mental retardation.

Meanwhile, the simple villagers are clothed in a cross between discarded medieval clothing and a potato sack.  However, the main female character from the village is always fashionably dressed in finely-tailored tight-fitting dresses that would qualify as haute couture today.

1006793,5,6305291403,"Having just visited the opera version of this film IL POSTINO by Daniel Cat&aacute;n courtesy of PBS Great Performances it is rewarding to return to the original source to honor the nidus for the inspiration for the opera. Directed by Michael Radford the film relates the heartwarming story of Mario (Massimo Troisi), a gentle and simple postman who falls for the beautiful caf&eacute; waitress  Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta) from his village, but is too shy to speak to her. He meets the famous Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (Phillipe Noiret), and, as their friendship develops, the postman's own inner poet awakens. Soon he is able to win the love of Beatrice and even stand up for and express his own beliefs.

This is a simple story graced by sensitive performances: of not the actor Massimo Trosi died from heart failure on the last day of production of the film. It is possibly this knowledge of the loss of one of Italy's best comedic actors along with the clarity and transparency of the film's gentle message about love and art that has made it a cult film.  At any rate this is a film that belongs in every movie lover's library.  Grady Harp, November 11",1322265600,,1164,4.719211822660099

Maria Grazia Cucinotta is outstanding in this. Set design, cinematography, and landscapes are all great. Sound might have used a bit of improvement in a couple of spots, as Troisi's character had a tendency to speak in low tones, he was at times difficult to understand.

1006800,5,6305291403,I originally avoided this movie as the trailers made it sound like a refined geek pursues beauty movie.  My assumption was very far off.  The movie was about poetry and friendship within a backdrop of romance and love.  The simplicity of story and the way it was presented was beautiful.  Massimo's subtle humor and reserved approach in the role was Oscar worthy.  I was saddened to hear he passed away just a short time after filming was completed.  Fifteen years later I understand what all the hoopla was about!,1284249600,,514,4.719101123595506
1006841,5,6305291403,"I can not recall a foreign film that was as delightful and unimposing, nor as brilliant and enjoyable, as Il POSTINO.  The main character, a son of a poor fisherman, Mario Ruopollo won our hearts with his meek and timid persona, his off-beat humor, and his passionate desire to become an artist and poet as he develops a relationship with the famous international poet Pablo Neruda, who lives in exile in the small seafront Italian village where Mario lived.

Who can forget Mario's unassuming personality as he humbly tries to win the affection of the local beauty, and also win the respect of the famous poet, Neruda. The scenes of him trying to create metaphors in his love letter to his sweetheart was especially moving.

Also, the cinematography of the beautiful Italian shoreline was breathtaking, and was in a sense yet another 'character' in the story ... because these scenes accentuated the splendor and passion of Mario and his desire to be a 'poet'.

Il POSTINO will stay with you long after you've seen the film.  This delightful film is available for a reasonable price on DVD.

1006850,3,6305291403,"that thinks that many of these acclaimed Foreign films, and especially, the Italian films  ( I am Italian myself ) are dull and plodding??

They take the most small and trivial of situations and then labor through it for 2 hours.

In this case, IL POSTINO, my feeling is that it looked like it had to be chop edited to make a certain amount of running time. There were many jump points that bore inconsistency.

the lead girl couldn't be less interested in the main character, or men, in general, however, several scenes later , she is seductively rolling a plastic ball in her mouth.

The Aunt or matron or whatever she was, of the lead girl, is ready to shoot the suitor with a shotgun, but then, after he whisks her off for an elopement style marriage, we see no repercussions whatsoever, in fact, he is now a worker in the small cafe of the angry matron.

Blink your eyes, and there is a grown up son walking around.....blink once more, and a completely tragic event occurs off screen without any sort of buildup whatsoever.

Minutes after finishing that movie, I was scanning movie channels on cable, and happened upon Forrest Gump, and then, hypnotically glued to this movie, in spite of the fact that I had seen it so many times before, and after yet another great cry at the ending, I said to myself:  THIS is beauty and THIS is profoundness.......

1006872,5,6305291403,"Il postino is the film adaption from the novel of Chilean author Antonio Skrmeta.  the Basic plot is almost identical. Apart from the fact that in the movie Mario is 30 year old Italian rather than 18 year old Chilean boy who worships Nobel lauterate poet Pablo Neruda.

Due to the change of background, the movie is almost non-political in comparison to the novel that describs the advent of horrible dictatorship of Pinochet. Although there are a couple scenes that remotely criticize allegedly right wing politician, who call D'Annunzio as ""His Poet"", as well as huge communist demonstraion scene in the end that beautifully potrayed in Black and White.
Since Mario doesn't want to follow his father's vocation as fisherman, he spends most of his time doing practically nothing. It was late 40s or early 50s in southern Italy where unemployment rate was higher than the rest of Europe ,thus most able young men tended to leave their hometown for either to Turin ,Milan, Germany or the United States. By chance, Mario obtains the position as a postman in a local post office . In truth , it's special type of postman who exclusively delivers mail for the sake of world famous poet Pablo Neruda who recently exiles in Italy. At first , Mario seems to be interested in the sobriquet of Pablo Neruda ""Poet of Love and Women"",however , a bit by bit thorugh contacting  Pablo Neruda , Mario begins to change and opens his eyes to the power of poem and the world he could not see. The slow change is portrayed so naturally by late actor Massimo Troisi. Some will say his acting is slightly passive. But it's his style; a bit mumbling , hesitating , stammering as if he ie a bit mentally challenged. As many people pointed out it is not a romantic comedy,but it was heart warming movie that show how friendship and poem can change a person who otherwise remains passive and never try to change his life.

1006879,5,6305291403,"I had recalled ""Il Postino"" making a bit of a splash at the Academy Awards about a dozen years ago.  It certainly got more mention at that awards ceremony than most foreign language films before or after.  I knew it had something to do with Pablo Neruda, the great Chilean poet and, of course, a postman.  I couldn't understand the Italian title since I presumed that it took place on a Chilean island.  All that and more unravelled before me last night as I found out for myself why ""Il Postino"" was so talked about 12 years ago.  This is a beautiful movie that says so much on so many levels.  It is the story of a simple man who finds the courage to seak out his own greatness.  It is the story of a great man who finds the humility to seakout his own simplicity.  It is a movie full of life, laughter, sadness and humanity.

""Il Postino"" generally comes across as a light comedy but we eventually are confronted with an opposite emotion.  I was sorry, initially, that the movie switched gears the way it did until I realized that the force of its' impact would only have been diluted any other way.  The acting in ""Il Postino"" is superb all around with top kudos going to the title character, the actor who plays Neruda, and Beatrice's mother.

It is not about Mario's romance (as described) but about his relationship with the famed poet.  When Mario speaks, he mumbles, slurs his words, and often does not face the person listening to him.  In addition, he speaks so slowly that all sympathy for him is lost.  No one watching the film with me found anything funny in the film, yet it is described as a ""romantic comedy.""  Other parts of the film are predictable and boring. One person with  me fell asleep watching it.  Another spent time petting the dog.

1006930,5,6305291403,"Nominated for Best Actor (Massimo Troisi), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Music, Best Director, and Best Picture, ""Il Postino"" is a tender tale of love and poetry on a small island in the Mediterranean Sea, inspired by an incident in the life of Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet who was briefly exiled, in 1952, for his communist ideas which have often got him into trouble...

'Il Postino' is a beautiful, heartbreaking movie, funny in its simplicity and honest dialog...

Massimo Troisi leaves his final legacy in the role of a shy, hesitant and uncultured postman who possesses the heart of a poet with truly peculiar observations, such as 'the whole world is the metaphor for something else,' often without realizing how exciting his comments are...

Director Michael Radford had the care to create a wonderful film which floats on the love of words, rhythm, and imagery... His movie is much heightened by a music score that includes quotes, paraphrases and Argentinean tangos...

His film turns out to be a great little movie... It deals with a friendship between a lethargic villager, who takes the modest job of delivering letters to the celebrated poet living in a secluded area... Poetry becomes their connection...

Mario Ruoppolo is a simple man with a complicated set of values who rides his bicycle climbing the hard road to Neruda's cozy home and with his timid manners delivers the armful of correspondence to the single customer of the island...

A polite Neruda shows little interest in his personal postman, but he favors him, one day, with his autograph, signing one of his books with the words 'Regards, Pablo Neruda.' Nevertheless as time passes the 'poet of love' becomes a bit more friendly, intrigued by Mario's enthusiasm regarding his poetry and poetic manner of speaking...

Mario, impressed that almost every letter delivered to Neruda is from a female, couldn't understand how his new resident, despite his advancing age, has such magical power over women... So he tries, with his simple way of thinking, to understand all the secrets of the exalted poet, sharing his thoughts with him... He becomes increasingly curious, asking a lot of questions about the mystical creation of poetry, forcing the fascinating celebrity to reveal some of the unexposed materials of his artistic vision... Neruda introduces Mario to the verbal rupture of metaphors, attempting to teach them to his anxious pupil... The two men discover an unexpected friendship based on their mutual view that life should be a framework for seduction and romance...

As the film goes on, Mario, crafted with a tender spirit, attempts, through Pablo, a gentle intervention and poetry to win over the woman he has fallen for, Beatrice Russo - played by Sicilian fashion model Maria Grazia Cucinotta...

Becoming in a slow way his 'Latin Cyrano de Bergerac,' Neruda guides his postman into romance, but refuses to write a poem that could charm his young passionate Beatrice...

To attract the prettiest girl in town, Mario becomes a bit of a poet himself... But when he finds his own words insufficient to his romantic mission, he appropriates one of his tutor's sensuous poems, and protests, when discovered, that ""Poetry doesn't belong to those who write it, but to those who need it.""

Unbelievably his 'lyrical words' fascinate the sensual bombshell who was playing a mean game of table soccer in a low cut dress, but disturb greatly her disapproving aunt Donna Rosa, who sees that Mario is contaminating her niece with his nice words... Nevertheless the postman wins the beautiful Beatrice and convinces her to marry him...

Heartbreak comes when Neruda receives a telegram that he can return to the country he loves so much... From here on, an extended epilogue with smiles, tears and regret, takes the story on... And the film almost breathes lyrical tenderness in its depiction of an honest man who longs so much for love...

Mario, who has not received any word or greeting from the poet and had remarked that it's quite normal for the poet not to remember him, returns to the poet's villa to revisit the place that had once been alive with the sounds and sights of emotional discovery... In the silence that now surrounds it, he realizes that the poet has taken all the beautiful things away with him...

He gets the idea to create a 'live' poem for his dearest friend Don Pablo... An outdoors tape to let him listen to the wonderful sounds of the island, from the small and big waves at the Cala di Sotto, to the wind on the cliffs, to the wind through the bushes, to the sad nets belonging to his father, to the church bell of Our Lady of Sorrow, to the starry sky over the island, to Pablito's heartbeat...

Philippe Noiret (best remembered for 'Cinema Paradiso') charms us once again as the affectionate mentor to Mario... He convinces the postman that poets are quite human but warns Mario about the old Dictaphone saying, 'Even the most sublime ideas sound ridiculous if heard too often.'

The sets and the cinematography, accompanied by an Oscar Winning Score, create a wonderful atmosphere of the remote poor island with no running water, of the modest houses with pealing plaster, of the Rocky cliffs overlooking the blue Mediterranean, of the post-war fishing village under the shades of rose and salmon...

Like love itself, some great movies seem surprisingly human... Delbert Mann's 'Marty' was one, Cameron Crowe's 'Say Anything...' was another, and now Michael Radford's ""Il Postino"" is exceptional... His film stands tall in its own right as a 'must see' movie... It's tough to imagine anyone not liking it... It simply revives our memories, and breaks our heart...",1168387200,9,5680,4.962105263157895

1006964,5,6305291403,"Another inspiring italian movie that describes in a simple, yet profound way basic things of life such as love, friendship, poetry, and the magnifisent, unique mediterranean landscape.

The making of this movie was Massimo Troisi's dream and upon realizing this dream he died just a few hours later; I am sure with a sence of accomplishment and satisfaction.

The humor in the movie is very sublte. Right at the beginning of the movie Massimo Troisi, a  man of few words, is having a monologue. This is because he talks about his alergy for the sea water to his father, who is a man of no words. He lives on an island where the 99% of the population are fishermen and he is allergic to sea water, this is funny.

One of the best momments of the movie is when Philippe Noiret asks Massimo Troisi to describe his island and he says: ""Beatrice Russo"", the girl he is in love with. But at the end of the movie he records what his island is: the sound of the waves at the shore, the cry of his baby, the sound of the birds, the sound of the wind through the bushes. This is really what life is and these are the things that unfortunately escape our notice.

The resemblence of Philippe Noiret with Pablo Neruda is incredible. The extras of the dvd are great and they really gave me the desire to visit Chile and of course they made me nostalgic of the unique mediterranean region.

Do not expect to see any special effects in the movie. But look for the simple things of life that can make you rich and can make you become a poet. After reading some reviews that give only one star to this movie I am afraid to recommend it in case it ends up with the wrong people. I would recommend it to people that enjoyed ""La vita e bella"",  ""The big blue"" and the ""Cinema il Paradiso"" (See my reviews for these movies as well).",1161561600,6,1811,4.3088235294117645
1006965,5,6305291403,"You have probably read the plot summaries above and you know that this is the  story of a postman (il postino) and a poet-Pablo Neruda. It's the story of their relationship during a period (1949-1952)when Neruda was exiled from Chile for his political activities and settled on a small italian island.

The easiest story to understand in this movie is the one about the postman's love for the tavern keeper's neice and how Neruda helps him frame his feelings in words and win the girl's heart. It's a variation on the Cyrano de  Bergerac/John Smith story and very sweet. There's another, more indirect story of il postino's growing love for his island and its beauty.

There is also the poignant subtext of the movie itself: the actor Massimo Troisi, who plays the postman died of heart failure (heart failure after filming a love story!) a few days after shooting was completed. He knew as the film was being made that he was unlikely to live to see it edited and exhibited.

But the surprising and subtle part of the story is the combination of affection and indifference that the great poet showed for his humble acolyte. Most American viewers can't help but wish for Neruda to remember his postman after he leaves the island, to stay in touch. We hope for a great democrat in a great artist.

Alas, Neruda was a lover of The People, but not necessarily of persons. His distance is realistic, even if not emotionally satisfying to the viewer. After all, most Nobel Prize winners probably don't remember the fellow who brought them the mail at the house they occupied in exile.

Anyway, a few days ago I came on this poem by Neruda. It's called 'A Dog has Died' I read it because my dog too has died and . . . . well anyway, here it is:

No, my dog used to gaze at me,

paying me the attention I need,

the attention required

to make a vain person like me understand

that, being a dog, he was wasting time,

but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,

he'd keep on gazing at me

with a look that reserved for me alone

all his sweet and shaggy life,

always near me, never troubling me,

and asking nothing.

And suddenly I understood a bit more about Neruda and il postino. I think I'll watch the movie again.

1006966,4,6305291403,"Massimo Troisi IS this film. I went to watch it with the worse expectations: 1) another manipulative commercial movie 2) in which beautiful scenery hides lack of ideas 3) yet another rehash of Don Quixote and ""antagonic duets that end up learning from each other"". 4) Romantic readings of tangos, the music from my native Argentina, by Mr. Luis Bacalov, who turned out to be an Argie too. I expected a ""Piazzolla all over"", glib enough to have won an Oscar. In sum ""Romance an poetry in Italy for real Dummies"".

I had to gulp my words. The director cares for the characters, and although it does manipulate, it does it so well one almost wants things to turn out ""like they should"". Miss Cuccinota has the right kind of ""rough beauty"" and scant vocabulary for her role. The secondary characters are very well placed: her fiery aunt ""Donna Rosa"" (Moretti), the square priest, his mute dad that nevertheless understands a lot, the glamorous sleazy politician.

""Sociologically"" it's a feast, but does not impose a heavy handed view on its topic. It's just there, like when Mario enumerates the beautiful things of his homeland, most are nature-related. And truly different, each from the other. Or the importance of the church, the universal referent (from Neruda to the commie chief postman, they all bow under it). Or the way he speaks to ""Don Pablo"". And then, his very down to earth justification of His absences. And his reply to his telegrapher boss (Scarpa) ""if he's a communist, and they are supposed to work for the people, why doesn't he come here?"". Neruda's description on why he wrote the ""Canto General"" is superb. If only it were true (that culture helps the forgiven) :).

Maybe the best is also the cruelest: Mario saying ""So what if we break our chains? What do we do then?"" His surname sounds like an anagram of Popolo, just a nod maybe?

All in all, I have to accept I went out of the cinema a happier and wiser person. Knowing a bit more about ""deep Italy"" and values in a primitive society. And still with unanswered questions, like when Mario postulates that the world may be a metaphor for something else.

Mr. Radford did some documentaries early on his career, and I think it shows in some shots, secondary to the plot, but vital for the ""settings"". It's also an acid film, in which everybody is alone. Beatrice playing with the workers late in the film, the lack of communication between Mario and his dad, her aunt's ugly capitalism. The compassion-less priest. But I guess, again, you can enjoy the film without thinking, ""as poetry should be done"" as Pablo explains. Anway, quoting him again ""event the most sublime idea gets to be banal if repeated too many times"". I guess that would mean that the essence of happiness is in changing, not obsessing with things and people? I leave this philosophical question for the reader to think about.

""Jotix100"" from NY's review TITLE has great simplicity, as well as his review focusing on the literary aspect made me realize I'll never look at metaphors the same way : ). Thanks to Amazon reviewer Michael J. Mazza (Pittsburgh, PA) I remembered his catchy phrase about the property of work. Interestingly enough, it relates to thoughtful French deconstruction philosophy. It is, in essence, a Marxist argument. So, it's very wrong, but a nice touch in the context. Debbie Wesselman (*also from PA) reminded me about the often quoted but very powerful Neruda line of ""being tired of being human"". Also about Noiret's essential performance. He's given very beautiful lines! She is right about (the courtship's steps having) ""all the humor and bittersweet missteps of the real thing"" and Mario being in love with language as well as with Beatrice.

I remember when it was issued some complained about him not really speaking the lines. I think this is rubbish, he does impersonate the character well, and without demagogy.

Summing up, agree with this one: ""complex and poignant story about the pain of growing into one's destiny"" by-Tom Keogh (Amazon).",1155168000,5,4023,4.803468208092486

But my opinion is that it wasn't slow.  Rather, it was deliberate in conveying Mario's character prior to meeting Neruda so the audience could understand the level of influence he had on Mario.  It's much more poignant to see this type of transition in its entirety.

I didn't know anything about Massimo Troisi prior to the film and actually didn't know until after I saw it that he had died on the last day of production.  To me that has an even greater impact on the film.  This film makes you think - which I happen to like.  So if you're just watching purely for entertainment sake, you may not enjoy it.

What we all long for is to find true lover or unconditional love. Well Mario, the main character, looks like he's not got much game but after meeting Pablo Neruda, who's in exile, he learns about metaphors. The metaphors of life is all around is in the small things and the big things. The sadness of the rain, the smile of the sun, the wailing wind. My best friend compared my poems to that of Neruda and I read up about him. Simply fell in love with his poetry and now after this movie I want to find out everything I can about this man. Back to the film, the visuals and location is very good. The cinematography is special because so much of the movie is being said without words. Italian film makers seem to do this well as in Malena!

1006969,5,6305291403,"""Il Postino,"" by British director Michael Radford, provides a powerful reminder that even in this age of special effects and mega-buck blockbusters, the key to any good film is a good story.  The rest is all window-dressing -- which can be entertaining, but a movie is never elevated to greatness by window dressing.

This movie, set in the early 1950s, starts with an incredibly basic ""fish out of water"" premise, and slightly tweaks it.  Our hero, Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi, who may have the most soulful eyes of the 90s), is a fish very much of the waters of his small, rustic Italian island.  The fish out of water is the famous poet Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret), exiled from Chile.  Mario is unemployed, so he takes the low-wage job of postman for the famed Neruda, who lives with his gorgeous wife in a picturesque, isolated villa.

Mario is naturally star-struck by this celebrity who can move thousands with his words.  Mario is a quiet, uneducated man living among quiet, uneducated islanders (the only jobs seem to be fishing and serving wine to the fishermen).  And yet Mario has a romantic soul and an inquisitive mind, and soon his honest, naive questions have struck a chord in Pablo's heart.  The poet takes Mario under his wing, teaching him the basics of poetry.

This is great timing for Mario, for he is struck by the thunderbolt of love when he sees the beyond-beautiful Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta -- you will be thunderstruck when you see this beauty).  Mario's dumbstruck awe is hilarious during a foosball game with this angel.  But taught by Pablo, can he fail to win Beatrice's heart?

But this is Italy, a land of sorrows, and while Mario may get the girl, he loses Pablo.  The political winds change, and Neruda returns to Chile.  His departure injects a melancholy into Mario's life, but Mario now has the craft to give voice to all his ideas of love and justice.  Soon, Mario is taking a stand not just for his own emotional well-being, but for the political future of the island and its people.

An emotional ending provides many surprises, and a few tears.

This is a beautifully shot movie, but uses a realistic eye.  This is not a glossy coffee-table book of a movie like ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" which pummels you into acknowledging that Tuscany is gorgeous.  Rather, ""Il Postino"" is shot in such a way as to remind you of the beauty we see in our everyday life, including the rush of the waves over the pebbles, or the unadorned view of stars in the Italian sky.  Cinematographer Franco Di Giacomo outdid himself here.

The realistic beauty of this Italian island is almost topped by the understated soundtrack, which relies heavily on traditional Italian instruments like the accordion.  Isn't it amazing how the accordion gets so little respect in the United States, and yet it often provides the perfect tone for movies?  While this isn't a hyper-witty soundtrack like ""Swingers"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" it is safe to say that this soundtrack is one of the most effective in recent years.

As you can tell, I am a huge fan of this movie.  It is very political for a ""romantic comedy,"" and don't go in expecting a European attempt at a Meg Ryan film.  ""Il Postino"" tells a wonderful story of simple people living their lives in a simple, earnest way.  It will irresistably melt your heart.",1128729600,12,3339,4.710344827586207

His job is to deliver mail to the famous (and real) poet, Pablo Neruda, who has been exiled to this island from Chile, because of his Communist beliefs.  The kindly poet opens a new world of words for the postman; they become friends, and with Neruda's help, Mario wins the most prettiest girl in the village.  Life is beautiful, until a letter arrives saying Neruda may return to Chile, forever.

""Il Postino"" is usually described as a romantic comedy, but I would call it a poignant drama, focusing on the changes in Mario's life after he meets and befriends the poet.  The film is dedicated to Massimo Troisi who plays Mario.  Making this movie was his dream, even though he was ill, and, in fact, he died only hours after filming was completed.  He gives a wonderful performance as the sensitive young man who grows to appreciate the beauty around him and the power of words.  The ending is quite surprising and touching.  The movie was nominated for five Academy Awards.  It is in Italian with English subtitles.

To be honest this film didn't live up to the grandiose expectations of the reviews that presided it. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, it's a good movie, it just isn't quite the poetic, romantic masterpiece I had anticipated.

Problem 1: First, it's a little slow and tedious as you wait patiently for Mario (Massimo Trois), the village mail carrier, to get up the courage to make his romantic intentions known to the beautiful Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta) who works as a waitress in her families restaurant. He procures the aid of a new resident in town, the famous Chilean poet and political activist Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret) to help him impress his love interest. Pablo encourages Mario to translate his emotions into words to woe the enchanting but distant Beatrice.

Problem 2: The other major drawnback in my estimation was that once the conquest is complete and the wedding is underway it seems from that moment on Mario's primary concern is his friendship with Pablo. When Pablo decides to return to his homeland Mario is consumed with sadness and seems to ingnore Beatrice and all the wonderful things he has achieved in Italy. How a shy, simple villager could be so lucky as to win the love of the incredible Beatrice and then delegate her to secondary importance is totally beyond comprehension.

This film is more a story of the enduring bond of friendship and not the romantic love story it was advertised to be. It's enjoyable but not a classic.

Positives: 'Il Postino' does serve as a tender and fitting memorial to Massimo Trois who died on the final day of filming. There are also some nice scenic shots of the Italian coastline and countryside. Then of course there is the even more scenic Maria Grazia Cucinotta to enjoy.",1126483200,5,1789,4.814332247557004

1007034,5,6305291403,"""Il Postino"" (""The Postman"") is a triumphant italian film released in 1995 starring renowned italian star Massimo Troisi.  It received five Oscar nominations including Best Picture and won one (Best Original Score).  This film follows the true events of a shy man Mario who falls in love with a young beautiful woman Beatrice.  His inspiration to win over her heart was world-famous Chilian poet Padro Neruda.  The two stories combine create a film that follows friendship, love, and politics.  Everything happens after Mario accepts a job at the post office, riding his bike to deliver mail.  These passionate events lead to an unforgettable conclusion that will leave audiences breathless.

This film is told wonderfully through poetry.  Yet, the poetry and the screenplay writing distinguishes itself perfectly to tell the story of Mario's sudden emotions.  Therefore, the characters aren't always speaking poetically.  The impressive creativity within the writers separates their efforts from most other films.  Throughout the film, the emotional stance maintains its loveliness within love and past hardships endured by a certain man.  Somehow, they manage to fit the wonders of living in Italy beautifully.

These words are expressed wonderfully through the actors.  Though all the performers worked great, Triosi and Phillippe Noiret state their presence most powerfully.  Triosi's powerful theme goes beyond his sudden death one day after filming.  His Oscar-nominated efforts (Best Actor) as Mario proves his passion for this film.  He leaves the acting scene with his best performance in his fifteen-year career.  Noiret's underrated performance as Neruda maintains the political stance of the film beautifully.  His efforts give great homage as the influence of the film events.

""Il Postino"" was my first introduction to Pablo Neruda, the poet who changed my life and first inspired my lifelong love of writing poetry.  Though, I was an avid poet before, I owe a great thank you to the spirit of Pablo Neruda for bringing inspiration to my voice as a writer.

For starters, this film was masterfully directed, the cast couldn't be better, and it is definitely a great cross-over film that can be enjoyed by men, women, young people, old people, and even children.  (Personally, I don't think anyone younger than thirteen should see this film.)  It was, in fact, based on a novel of the same name (I much prefer the film to the novel, though---personal opinion.) .  Mario Ruopollo (played by the late, great Massimo Troisi--who died twelve hours after the film was completed), is a fourty-year old postman in a sleepy fishing town in Italy.  The shy man's life is centered around his job of delivering mail, until a chance encounter with the legendary, exiled Chilean poet , Pablo Neruda (Philip Noiret), changes his life forever.  He finds himself learning about poetry what a metaphor (""metafore"" in Italian) is.  Of course, the learning curve is, at first, quite steep.  Neruda asks Mario what he thinks of when he pictures the sea, and he says, ""I feel seasick.""  Poetry takes front and center stage when Mario finds himself falling for Beatrice Russo (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), the most beautiful woman on the island.  This is when the ""Cyrano De Bergerac"" element of the story begins, and Neruda becomes the written voice for Mario to win Beatrice's heart.

This film stirred me so much when I first saw it.  I laughed, I pondered and I finally burst into tears.  You will have to see it for yourself to understand the power of this film.  I guarantee you will probably be looking up ""Pablo Neruda"" in a key word search when the film is long over.

In weaving its leisurely unfolding tapestry (hint: the movie may feel slow to people who're used to Hollywood's wham-bam), the film works on many different levels -- a tribute to the power and beauty of poetry; a tale of brotherhood; a charmingly quirky romance (between Troisi and barmaid Maria Grazia Cucinotta).

He may have created interesting metaphors, but he was unable to comprehend morality. It wasn't that Soviet crimes were unknown in Neruda's time, it was that he chose to support them. His career was devoted to extolling Marxism, and he accepted the Stalin prize from the Soviet murderers.
It is impossible to imagine a film made today that glorified an artist who was a Nazi, but we are still subjected to the mythmaking that, at once, conceals and implicitely justifies communist mass slaughter.

Likewise, Philippe Noiret as Neruda provides a memorable portrait of a man who can forget the power of his words.
I can't help comparing ""Il Postino"" to ""Life is Beautiful"", also an Italian film that relies on initial humor to set up the pain found in the human heart.  ""Il Postino"" is more subtle, however, and more realistic.  Still, those who enjoyed ""Life is Beautiful"" should also like ""Il Postino.""

1007057,4,6305291403,"I definitely didn't plan on watching this movie.  In fact, I had asked for a science fiction flick set in the future recommended by my brother, a movie which just happened to have the same English title.  Imagine my shock when instead of seeing a futuristic picture set in 2010, at home I find myself watching an Italian romantic comedy set in 1954.  But my shock soon changed to pleasure as I began watching.

Il Postino (sub-titles in English) is about a remote Italian island that becomes home to the world-famous poet Pablo Neruda (a Nobel prize winning poet in real life), who is exiled from his home country of Chile.  He is befriended by the gentle Mario, a simple postman who delivers his mail and is eager to discover the secret and power of poetry which seems to have women worldwide at Neruda's knees.  A beautiful relationship of understanding develops between these two men, as the inarticulate Mario uses poetry to woo the beautiful woman with whom he has fallen in love: Beatrice Russo.  The passion that leads to love at first sight is not credible, but there's no arguing with the power and passion of the poetry, although it's certainly not appreciated by his love's aunt: ""When a man starts touching you with words, his hands are not far behind.  I'd prefer a drunkard at the bar that touches her bum than a man who says Your smile spreads like a butterfly.""  But don't be fooled - the movie is not primarily about the romantic relationship between Mario and Beatrice, but more than anything it is about the tender relationship between the poet and the peasant postman that comes to the foreground.  The beauty of this relationship offers much more than the average big-screen love story.  Italian movies, it seems, are able to achieve something that seems to be out of reach of the standard Hollywood blockbuster - gentleness, beauty and charm, without the distractions of sex, profanity and violence.  The poetry offers an intelligence sadly lacking in many other movies, with many memorable lines such as: ""Poetry doesn't belong to those who wrote it, but to those who need it.""

Much like the Italian ""Life is Beautiful"", the movie consists of two acts, the second act occurring several years after marriage.  Here there is a rapid change of gears and tone, as Neruda departs the island, and postman Mario and his wife go into a crisis.  The initial romance and comedy turns to tragedy as Mario heart-wrenchingly tries to come to terms with the fact that his poet and friend appears to have forgotten him, and makes a sound recording of the island so that Neruda can remember its poetic beauty.  Here we see the profound results of Neruda on Mario - he sees the world in a whole new way, even though his new outlook on life comes with a tremendous cost.  As Neruda returns to the island and listens to the recording, by means of flashbacks we are shown the terrible tragedy that ensues as Mario deals with political corruption and follows the communist ideals of his poet and friend.

The tragic note is powerful and sad, and yet deeply mysterious - quite honestly the precise purpose of the ending eluded me, although the final note seemed significant in a way that I couldn't quite understand, despite being unsatisfying.  Perhaps it is simply to reflect on the powerful effect that the poetry, politics and person of Neruda had using Mario as a microcosm.  Center stage is not romance, but the power and passion of poetry and friendship, and their ability to change and enrich an individual's life, although this point doesn't come out with the clarity as one might hope.  Despite the somewhat perplexing ending, what lingers in the mind is this tender and beautiful relationship between a poet and a postman, and the poetry that bonded them together.  It's a slow and gentle ride - far from the action of the futuristic science fiction flick I was expecting - but there is a haunting and lasting beauty about this movie, matched by the breathtaking Italian landscape and a hauntingly beautiful dramatic score that won an Academy Award.  Although not quite as good as ""Life Is Beautiful"" (there are many similarities between the two), it's still no wonder that ""Il Postino"" was an overwhelming success and gained several Academy Award nominations including ""Best Picture"".  Massimo Triosi puts in a wonderful performance as the simple Mario.  It turns out that it was his last, because he died of heart failure the day after filming was completed, his physical weakness perhaps making his characterization even more successful.

A bicycle, a pen and paper, a village, a country house, a view of the sea - and what might be... Il Postino juxtaposes bumbling murmurs and ingenius metaphors, knowing and wanting to know, confidence and overwhelming insecurity. It helps that I love bicycles and the coast of Italy as well as the poetry of Pablo Neruda, one of the greatest (and most widely read) poets of the 20th century. Il Postino is a wonderful fable of longing and lust, stolen glances, shyness and gambles, reading and risk taking.
And as Pablo Neruda himself made clear, Il Postino reminds us that poetry and politics are for peasants and well as the powerful, perhaps even more so. We peasants need to be engaged in expressing ourselves and, even if we're shy, even if we shake in our shoes, standing for passion and principle.
Il Postino is one of my very favorite movies of the 1990s. It makes a worthy Italian double feature with Life is Beautiful.",1024876800,3,1073,4.712765957446808

The story is set in early 50's in Italy where a young man (Mario Ruoppolo) works with his father, an Italian fisherman. It is subtitled in yellow, easy to read and follow. The movie exudes softness even when it takes a turn into the political upheaval.

Taking a job at the postal unit, he is assigned a route up a mountain to deliver mail to one man and his wife. The man, a poet, is living in exile as his communist ideas got him in trouble. Pablo Neruda writes poetry and is extremely popular with the women. It is in these mail delivery trips that shy Mario befriends Pablo and asks him to help him with poetry as he is wanting to attract the attention of a voluptuous waitress who works and lives with her meddling old aunt (Donna Rosa).

There are some memorable quotes about this wonderful movie about the love and power of poetry. Neruda the poet says. ""When you explain poetry, it becomes banal. Better than any explanation is the experience of feelings that poetry can reveal to a nature open enough to understand it.""
Mario says of the poetry: ""Poetry doesn't belong to those who write it; it belongs to those who need it.""

With the use of metaphors to relay his poetry, Mario learns from Pablo how to express himself. The beautiful waitress is impressed when he tells her that her smile spreads across her face like a butterfly.
When her meddling old aunt asks ""what did he tell you? ""Metaphors"" she says, The aunt asks, ""what metaphors did he do to you? Skeptical, she then steals more poems and takes them to the priest. When they read the words, ""naked you are as thin as bare wheat, naked you are blue like a Cuban night"" panic starts as she feels her niece has been touched and seduced.

The aunt says: ""When it comes to bed, there's no difference between a poet, a priest, or a communist! The conclusion of the love story takes a slight twist. See this!......Rizzo.",1024185600,8,2112,4.518324607329843
1007081,5,6305291403,"Developing a love of the written word, was the true love story in this film.  The love between man and woman is secondary in this masterpiece.  Evoking a truly beautiful portrait of a small village in Italy, Il Postino is a brilliant work.
Like other Italian workss, it focuses on the people in the story, rather than brilliant special effects or huge world events.  The world events in this piece are secondary to the effects of these events on the people.
The postman, in this story, is a shy young man, learning to understand women, and life through the help of an exiled Chilean poet living in his village.  The relationship between the poet, Neruda, and the postman is endearing, and is the other great love story of this work.  Watching the growth of a bond between these men is enchanting.
Italian films often evoke a romance, not just between people, but with the setting, the story, and all of the elements of the story.  This film does not fail.

1007082,5,6305291403,"The other day I had to watch this movie for my Italian class.  The movie was fabulous.  In the beginning of the film I felt bad for Mario (brilliantly acted by Massimo Troisi), he just seemed so awkward, and because he didn't like fishing, it seemed like he was a failure to his father and the rest of the village.  This begins to change when Mario becomes a postman, delivering mail to the Chilean love poet Pablo Neruda.  Mario and Neruda develop a great friendship + Mario becomes more confident and falls in love.  I had heard very good things about this movie, but watching it was a fabulous experience + it was better than I expected.
Today in Italian, we watched an interview with the director and the TV special about Neruda that are included on the DVD.  I didn't know, while watching the film, that the star Massimo Troisi was dying during filming.  Learning that he was holding on to life just to complete this film, made it all the more special and sad.  I also learned that the actor who played Neruda (Philippe Noiret) acted in French and was later dubbed into Italian.  I thought that was a really interesting fact.
All in all this is a great film.  It will make you cry.  It will make you want to read Neruda's poetry, and even more so, it will make you want to write poetry of your own.",1013731200,26,1303,4.365145228215767
1007083,5,6305291403,"This is one of the best films I ever saw and I realize that I am adding nothing original when I call it a poem of a film.  If this film were music it would be a Chopin Nocturne or an Impromptu by Schubert.  Not dazzling, not too difficult form a technical standpoint yet very profound, melancholy, disturbing, stirring, and emotionally stimulating.  The film is based on the novel by Antonio Skarmeta - a Chilean and student of Neruda.  in the novel the setting is an island not far from Santiago, where Neruda is temporarily confined. Other than the change in setting - which in the film is the island of Procida 3 naut. miles from Naples - the film respects Skarmeta's story.  I had read the book prior to seeing the film in its original Spanish and I was amazed by the translation of the story in film.  the Neapolitan dialect, or neapolitan inflected italian, of the film even sounds like Spanish.  naturally as a fan of Troisi and a Neapoliatn I think Massimo Troisi as the postman was the best possible choice.  In life he was generous, charming, humorous but always showed that slight melancholy that indicated his depth.  Noiret as Neruda is also well cast.  To add to the visual beauty of the sorroundings the excellent soundtrack of tango like music was very apt and flowed effortlessly with the reading of neruda's poems.  the story istelf is fictional and lossely based on Neruda's real life events though displaced in time.  Neruda did in fact become Chilean ambassador to France and was a strong supporter of Allende; moreover, Neruda always had leftist sympathies and was often in trouble with his government, which led to a number of exiles or 'trips' outside his country. Those who enjoyed Cinema Paradiso, Kolya, Mediterraneo and countless other films that can be described as piano pieces by Chopin or Schubert will love Il Postino.",1007942400,,1851,4.73208722741433
1007113,5,6305291403,"A man comes across a few crossroads in his life.  These crossroads sometimes comes in the form of influential people who change the way he perceives the world.  Il Postino documents the transformation of an Italian postman in a little Italian village.  The influence is no less than a Pablo Neruda, one of the most romantic poets who ever walk the face of earth.
The first thing that the postman picks up from his only client is obviously the penchant for the romantics.  The two slowly become friends and the postman requests the master to teach him poetry.  His inital motive is to use it to woo a local beauty who works in a bar he frequents.  The strategy works and the two end up getting married.  Neruda takes a leave to go back to his homeland Chile, after his banishment has been lifted by the Chilean government.
The film could easily end here and the film will still be highly memorable.  However, it is what comes next that pushes the film to the next level.  The postman grows weary of his destitute surroundings, and influenced by Neruda's Marxist views, he begins to lean towards the left wing.  Like reading great poetry, the postman initially falls in love with the words and imageries.  Then the words begin to sink in and the importance of the words felt.  Instead of falling into the realm of predictable romantic genre, the director, Michael Bradford shapes this into a mimicry of poetry which works successfully.
Many factors help make this possible.  The stunning cinematography appeals to the sense of sight and a great score accompanies an excellent script.  Taken together, these elements give a birth to a film that one can all too easily dub a masterpiece.  Whether it is one is open to arguments, however, I believe that many would agree that it is a special movie that would stay in many hearts for a long time to come.",1005782400,2,1848,4.625766871165644

Besides a politically charged plot, the cinematography is wonderfully rich.  The vast difference between the fishermen of the town and Pablo Neruda of the cultural elite is displayed well.  Neruda helps the simple postman to win the heart of his true love through poetry; the postman learns much from Neruda about the world outside.  However, this is not simply a love story.  The story ends with a twist unheard of in American movies: a twist that causes the viewer to reflect upon whether knowledge is all it is made out to be.",994809600,2,842,4.617449664429531
1007116,5,6305291403,"Il Postino is one of my top two or three movies. It is just so beautiful any way you look at it, and it has actually helped to make a change in my life.
Il Postino is about Mario, a mailman who has problems expressing himself. Of course, he has fallen in love with the local beauty and can't show it. Luckily for Mario, the Nobel-winning Chilean poet Pablo Neruda has been exiled to his island and can help Mario in his endeavors.
The real beauty in Il Postino isn't this ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" story, though. This movie is about the poetic depths that Neruda inpires Mario to reach for (Il Postino is really the visual form of Neruda's poem ""Poetry""). He inspires Mario to write. He inspires him to recognize the beauty of the world around him. He inspires Mario to think about the people around him and to work to help them. He inspires Mario to see the wonder of love. In short, Neruda, through poetry, teaches Mario how to love life and how to express that love.
Il Postino has done for me pretty much what Neruda did for Mario in the movie. This brilliant movie can inspire a love of life and a love of poetry. I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies or literature. It is well acted, well written, and very though provoking. I also urge that people not be scared off by the fact that it is a foreign film. The subtitles are well-done, and I never really notice that I am reading the movie.

For love can be that most elusive of butterflies, as a smitten young man discovers in ""Il Postino,"" directed by Michael Radford.  There's a bit of ""Cyrano"" in this tale of Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi), a somewhat unprepossessing part time mailman (he has but one customer) who falls for a local beauty, Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), but has no idea how to pursue the longings of his heart.  But as luck would have it, Mario's customer just happens to be Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret), a South American expatriate who is also a world renown poet recently exiled to this small island off the coast of Italy.  Not wanting to make a pest of himself, Mario only very gradually strikes up an acquaintance with Neruda, while his love for Beatrice goes unrequited.  Once Neruda is apprised of Mario's situation however, he begins to instruct him in the art of regarding the world around him in terms of metaphor, as well as how to thus express himself.  Soon Mario is composing poetry of his own, with hopes of not only attracting Beatrice's attention, but of winning her heart.  It's a warm and touching story that plays to the heart, rather than the intellect, and will capture you with it's humanity.  There is nothing singular about Mario; he is nondescript, just an average guy, and it illustrates that common bond among us all, that of having wants and needs to be expressed and fulfilled-- especially with regards to matters of the heart-- for as Mario discovers, love knows no boundaries.  Troisi gives a strong performance as Mario, but is almost too retiring to be effective, though his character contrasts well with that of Noiret's Neruda, whose zest for life is more readily apparent.  Still, it's that underplayed sense of the ""Everyman"" that Troisi conveys so well that allows the audience to relate to him.  Anyone who has ever yearned for the affections of that special someone will be able to identify with Mario.  Ironically, it's his benign manner that makes him-- as contradictory as it may seem-- so memorable and forgettable at the same time, perhaps depending upon the emotional investment the individual viewer is disposed to make.  As the poet Neruda, Noiret gives a notable performance, lending the character the sense of one who has known celebrity, yet is nonetheless still somewhat accessible.  And in him you can readily perceive a true poetic nature-- though somewhat self-centered-- which gives the character credibility and makes him real.  The supporting cast includes Linda Moretti (Donna Rosa), Renato Scarpa (Telegrapher), Mariano Rigillo (Di Cosimo) and Anna Bonaiuto (Matilde).  A romantic film in every sense of the word, ""Il Postino"" nevertheless transgresses beyond the romantic and takes a somewhat anticlimactic turn that encompasses loyalty and passion to a cause, as well as love.  In the end, it's a lyrical, pacific film that seeks to discern the beauty in all things, and certainly makes a statement about the nature of life and love.",984960000,4,3077,5.0019607843137255

In the midst of a pre-WW2 economicdepression, Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi) takes on a part-time jobdelivering mail to the remote cliff-side home of the famous poet PabloNeruda (Philippe Noiret).

1007121,5,6305291403,"The scene is Italy, circa 1953, a fisherman's village on a small island, Cala di Sotto, presumably in the south.  Internationally acclaimed poet and communist Pablo Neruda and his wife come to the island in exile from Chile.  He rents a house on a hill overlooking the sea.  Mario Ruoppolo, son of a fisherman who ironically can't stomach being out on a boat, becomes Neruda's postman.  The simple fisherman's son and the great poet strike up a friendship.
The first thing I should say about this poignant and beautiful film is it starts very slowly and you will be tempted to give up on it.  Don't!  In the tradition of the theater in which the playwright will sometimes make the captive audience squirm a little in boredom (to better set them up for what's to come), Director Michael Radford--an Englishman, by the way--begins slow and then slows down a little.  (A German proverb has it that ""hunger makes the best cook."")  But about one quarter of the way home the story begins to build, and by the time it's over we are in tears.
Massimo Troisi stars as the postman who wants to learn and use the power of poetry to woe the girl he loves.  It is a sad irony that he died just as the picture was completed.  Veteran French actor Philippe Noiret is suavely brilliant as Neruda, whose receipt of many letters from female fans intrigues Mario and motivates him to learn the master's secret.  Maria Grazia Cucinotta, who plays Beatrice Russo, the caf owner's daughter who waits tables, does not appear until the movie is almost half over, but she is more than worth the wait!  She has eyes as dark as black night and a figure to rival that of Sophia Loren in her prime.  It takes Mario ten seconds to fall in love with her.  However, Beatrice's mother wants something more than a part time postman for her daughter, a man whose ""capital is the fungus between his toes.""  Thus we have part of our story.  But the larger part of the story is the friendship between Neruda and Mario, and how they inspire and learn from one another.
There are a number of brilliantly planned scenes that delight.  I especially liked the scene in the church as the priest is saying he cannot accept Neruda as a best man since the man is a godless communist, when suddenly in the background we see Neruda in suit jacket and tie knelling at the altar as he crosses himself.  Very affecting was the scene in which Beatrice sees Neruda upon his return to the island react to Mario's son and hearing his name pronounced, ""Pablito,"" indicating that the boy had been named after him.
This is a film about beauty.  I think when we realize the beauty, that's a very good sign.  There is a little talk about how poetry works with some excellent examples woven into the script.  Ironically, the rather crude mother of Beatrice has some of the best lines, i.e., ""One touch and he will have you lying on your back,"" she advises her daughter.  When your mother tells you THAT, I think you can believe she knows what she is talking about!  When Mario, who is a natural poet, but a primitive, is asked by Neruda for a way to describe the fisherman's nets, he replies, ""sad.""  When he is asked to record something about the beauty of his island he spontaneously says, ""Beatrice Russo.""  There is in the background the struggle between the Christian Democrats and the communists in which Mario and Neruda are participants, each in his own way.  But this struggle is not emphasized and is in fact given its true devalued place in human affairs.  In the words of Mario, who has more important things on his mind, ""So what if we beak our chains.  What do we do then?""",982281600,8,3625,4.509954058192956
1007122,5,6305291403,"""Il Postino"" (""The Postman"") tells the story of the friendship between Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and the shy postman who delivers his mail while Neruda is living in Italy. This Italian film, directed by Michael Radford, is a beautiful and gentle work of art that celebrates love, friendship, and the power of poetry.
The performances are outstanding. Massimo Troisi brings an awkward charm to his role as the postman, Mario, and Phillipe Noiret is both majestic and appealingly down-to-earth as the revered poet. The supporting players are also superb, but it is the chemistry between Troisi and Noiret that really brings magic to the film.
The dialogue of ""Il Postino"" thoughtfully explores such issues as fame, political commitment, and the art of poetry. I especially love the line, ""Poetry doesn't belong to those who wrote it, but to those who need it."" But this is also a wonderfully funny film. Some of the scenes gave me some hearty belly laughs! The romance between postman Mario and a local girl is a particularly rich source of comic material.
If you are one of the millions who love the passionate poetry of Pablo Neruda, you should really see this film. And if you see the film before having read Neruda's work, I recommend that you read some of Neruda's poetry. To sum up, I highly recommend ""Il Postino.""",980467200,23,1319,4.84070796460177

The  movie is certainly not a tear-jerker, but any viewer will find themselves  becoming emotionally attached to its characters and highly affected by the  fate which befalls them.
  The film, directed by Michael  Radford, is the story of a humble Italian postman who is greatly changed by  the famous Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda for whom he works for in a small  Italian village. As the audience, we observe their acqaintanceship as it  changes and eventually develops into a true and unforgettable friendship.  Without a doubt, some audiences will find Il Postino  tedious because of the simple plot and the lack of sex and violence.  Nevertheless, it is an an emotional and powerful movie that I highly  recommend because of its strong character portrayal.  In my opinion, Il  Postino is truly successful because of its wonderful acting by Massimo  Troisi, who accurately portrays the innocent postman as well as Philippe  Noiret, who is a very endearing and astonishing Pablo Neruda.
  In  addition to the acting, the Italian landscape is a breathtaking and  integral part of Il Postino. Radford effectively incorporates the beautiful  mountains and seascape as the story's background. It is a refreshing  decision by Radford which only adds to the poetry which Noiret recites  periodically throughout the film.
  I am certainly the type of  person who prefers the book to the movie, but in this particular case, I  feel that the movie surpasses the Skarmenta's novel by far.  I recommend  this movie to anyone who is tired of movies with gratuitous sex and  violence as well as hackneyed forumlas.

Probably it wasn't the movie itself, but knowing how much Massimo Troisi gave to us with his unique  style. Grazie Massimo, Ciao e grazie ancora.",942105600,2,261,4.553191489361702

7887123,5,6305291403,"'Il Postino' is a feel-good movie. I had watched bits and pieces of it on Youtube and wanted to see the whole thing. I am trying to learn Italian, and watching movies is one of the ways I do it. The scenery in the movie is gorgeous, and the characters are completely loveable. This movie can be watched on so many levels, the travel, the political, a story of friendship, a romance. It's just a good story that shows that some goodness always exists in the world.",1515974400,,463,4.333333333333333

7887127,2,6305291403,"The DVD promoted this movie as a funny romantic comedy; what I saw of the movie was not that at all. It starts off with a fisherman's son on a small island near Italy receiving a letter from his relatives who have emigrated to the United States, while the son complains to his father about how being on a boat causes him health problems. Then he attends a theater with a newsreel where Neruta, an exiled Chilean communist poet is sent to this same island. (The movie fails to say, but it presumably takes place in the 1950's.) The son gets a job as a postman, whose boss is a political sympathizer of Neruta, and the son ends up delivering most of his mail to this poet. His interest in the poet is not political, but in his way of winning female admirers.

We didn't finish the movie; it was too slow-moving and took forever to get to the point. There were a few dry laughs, but mostly it was draggy with a lot of nothing happening. Maybe the movie worked better in Italy.",1491350400,,973,4.288043478260869
