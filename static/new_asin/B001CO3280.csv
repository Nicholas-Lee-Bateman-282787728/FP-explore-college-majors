3515368,1,B001CO3280,"I was very disappointed with this DVD for the following reasons:

1) The ""shows"" (all from the '80's) are not full shows.  The first 2 shows are less than 30 minutes each and the last is less than 15 minutes (just one act is shown).
2) The monologues have been edited.
3) In the first show, comedian Gary Shandling is introduced and he performs his act.  I had assumed that he was the first guest but turns out he is the second act. At one point as he is chatting with Johnny, makes a comment to the guest sitting next to him and we get to see this guest briefly.  I believe it is Tony Bennett.  I'm guessing that Tony sang and there was a copyright issue that prevented the performance from being on the DVD.
4) The second show had Robin Williams and Bob Hope as guests.  This part of the review has to do with the content of the show.  I like Bob Hope and was looking forward to seeing him.  But Robin Williams kept interrupting, adding jokes of his own.  It was really irritating. I can only take Robin Williams in small doses and after his own performance, I wish had would have just been content to sit there and let Bob Hope do his thing.
5) The last show only had one performance, a comedian.

I do not recommend this DVD.",1227312000,38,1229,4.191489361702128

8288506,1,B001CO3280,"I broke my own rule for shopping on Amazon:  check out the customer reviews before buying. If I had done that, I would have saved myself both money and disappointment.  These episodes are edited crudely (very choppy) and on my copy, the sound and picture are not in sync.  There are 3 episode included here, all reduced to fit in 72 minutes, so you get very little continuity.

I miss Johnny Carson, but this is no way to remember him.",1260144000,4,435,4.4
8288507,5,B001CO3280,"I thought the selections provided a good mix between monologues,skits and guests..

In looking at the jacket, i knew what i was getting..the dvd was around 75 minutes long...3 episodes at a time when the Tonight show was 60 minutes...with commercials...made it known that the episodes would not be entire episodes...So based on that..not sure how anyone would NOT know what they were getting..

Given that, it gave a good slice of the times, with good highlights..

My favorites were the skits...especially the one with johnny,doc and ed singing the 12 days of Christmas....

The monologue gave a great idea of what was going on at the time..with a holiday spin..

I loved seeing all of the poinsetta's...that's what i remember the most about the tonight show during the holidays watching johnny.....

It was great..sitting back for 75 minutes and revisting johnny and the tonight show....seemed like good times all over again..ahhhhhhh",1239062400,5,936,5.125
8288508,1,B001CO3280,How did these episodes get onto this DVD?  All from the 1980's and not that much Christmas stuff and not that funny with not that famous of people.  I still miss Johnny and this is a DVD we watched once and won't watch again!!!!,1231286400,2,228,4.159090909090909
8288509,5,B001CO3280,"We own every single Johnny Carson DVD and set and we absolutely LOVED our first view of this Johnny Carson Christmas Collection. While it could've been better if they would have included more complete episodes, it has all of the best highlights and moments and probably cut out of few that were less memorable. Two thumbs up!

8288511,1,B001CO3280,"Will I ever learn? Even after feeling ripped off with my last Johnny Carson purchase, I caved and bought this DVD thinking it would be a lot of fun to see some old Johnny shows from Christmas. They promote THREE shows, but they are hacked to bits. Why - given the fact Johnny hosted the Tonight Show for decades - would they include such little content? As long as this company continues to release Johnny DVD's, I wouldn't buy one again. Be warned and save your money!",1227657600,26,469,4.402298850574713
8288512,2,B001CO3280,"I was excited to see this collection then very depressed to see the ""Christmas With Friends"" special was not included.  If you don't remember, this was a 30-minute special, mostly music from Doc and the band, and ""The Night Before Christmas"" narrated by Ed Mcmahon.  NBC used to show this on or around Christmas night, when Johnny didn't put on a Tonight Show.  The CD of the music is available, but I'd love to have a copy of the show on DVD.  This seemed like a natural place to put it, but no such luck.

Another disappointment in the largely disappointing series of Carson DVD's.",1227657600,20,583,4.514285714285714
8288513,4,B001CO3280,"This DVD features some great moments from a few of Carson's best Christmas-themed shows.  Robin Williams is frenetic and wonderful - and it is interesting to see him early in his career. Gary Shandling is very funny, and Tony Bennett and Doc perform holiday music.  If you are a Carson lover this is a nice little addition to the collection.",1227657600,,341,4.666666666666667
