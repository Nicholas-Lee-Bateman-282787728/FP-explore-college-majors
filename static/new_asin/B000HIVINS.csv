2638192,5,B000HIVINS,"My kids and I really enjoy Creature Comforts.  It is laid-back dry British Humor, the characters and voices together make the creatures endearing.  Clean humor.  It has no plot to speak of and no action.  So if those are important to you, you might not like it.",1259712000,2,261,4.48936170212766
2638193,5,B000HIVINS,"This DVD is watched multiple times by our family and friends during the holiday season-We never tire of the humorous take on the ""Twelve Days of Christmas""- Get it- and enjoy some great laughs-You won't be sorry!~Another fine production by Nick Park-Very well done!",1258934400,,265,5.045454545454546

2638195,4,B000HIVINS,"If you are a fan of Nick Park's Creature Comforts you will probably NOT want to buy this, it is already on the SEASON 2 DVD SET! This special is wonderful, but only those non fans looking for holiday DVDs should consider this DVD release!",1200873600,24,238,4.311111111111111
2638196,5,B000HIVINS,The Creature Comforts gang does a Christmas special.  Interest puns and high jinx. As enjoyable and the series.,1185840000,4,111,5.166666666666667
2638197,5,B000HIVINS,"Bought it as a Christmas present for my wife (she has been an Aardman groupie for years if you can believe that) - but I found Creature Comforts Merry Christmas Everybody is included in Creature Comforts The Complete Second Season, so don't buy both. I unfortunately did buy both, so one of my kids gets this as a stocking stuffer.

(I keep trying to rate this thing as 5 stars, but the rating is changed apparetly at random  when I prereview the review.  I am getting tired of fighting with this review so I am about to let it go the way it turns up. Bare that in mind if the rating turns up less than 5.  Always remember, ""Computers are things of the devil.  And the smaller they are, the closer to the heart of hell they come from."")",1161820800,41,736,4.228571428571429

2638239,5,B000HIVINS,I love nick park!  How the animals were matched to the voices is just hilarious!  Thank you again to Aardman for making me smile!!,1385769600,,130,4.375
2638240,5,B000HIVINS,"I've been a fan of Nick Park / AArdman for some time, and this does not disappoint.

It's really funny, and of course has great production values.

This lends itself to repeat viewings, as the various British accents are quite foreign to American ears, and it's fun looking for little bits and pieces in the painstakingly hand assembled sets

A great addition to the Christmas catalog.

BUT WAIT!!! If you're about to buy this, just go ahead and get the complete series instead. You'll thank yourself for taking my sage advice.

Cheers!!",1361923200,4,537,4.793478260869565
2638241,3,B000HIVINS,This was not very good at keeping my grandkids interested enough to watch. The 6 year old didn't care for it and the 4 year old only watched about 1/3 of it.,1361318400,,157,3.9375
2638242,5,B000HIVINS,"As usual, the Brits have this great sense of humor.  The creatures remind me of some people I have met",1360972800,,102,4.1
2638243,5,B000HIVINS,"Creature Comforts Merry Christmas --Fell in love with these creatures when I saw them first on BBC,  then cancelled!!!!!  I have one for me and Christmas gifts for friends and family and actually a baby shower gift!",1356825600,,215,4.783783783783784
2638244,5,B000HIVINS,"This has become one of my favorite annual Christmas viewings and the funniest of my very large library of Christmas specials. So original and creative, and so very hilarious. Good pickup for just about anybody.",1356307200,,210,5.0285714285714285
2638245,5,B000HIVINS,"I love Creature Comforts...and this one does not disappoint. So clever the expressions and voices and how they've woven it around a christmas theme.  It's not overly long, but still entertaining.",1333929600,,195,5.290322580645161
2638246,5,B000HIVINS,I bought this dvd for my granddaughter. Ha! Ha! It was I who loved this little story. I think maybe these characters were created for the adults with young folks as an afterthought. Lovely dvd.,1320710400,,193,4.542857142857143
2638247,5,B000HIVINS,"What a hilarious English tongue-in-cheek look at Christmas and specifically the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" song.  The characters are exceedingly funny as none of the Aardeman Creature Comforts characters seem to get the knack of singing this favorite holiday song.  And the debate rages on, ""Why FRENCH hens?"", ""Wear a Christmas cracker hat or no?"", ""What indecent thing are the two turtle doves doing together anyway?"", ""Is that the Queen speaking?"", and on and on.  Don't expect it to make sense, just sit back and laugh through your enjoyment.

We bought this 3 years ago, and ended up buying several as gifts.  A hit as a gift.  And now we play it every Christmas, over and over.  It lightens the stress of the season, if you have any.  Kids will like it, but will miss some of the subtle English humor, but they won't care.  And old folks will love it, complete with very helpful subtitles.  Lots of accent to get through with these animal characters that seem more human and what they really are supposed to be.

Now the price is low enough to send it as a Christmas Card, and your friends will be able to enjoy your Holiday greeting for at least the Twelve Days of Christmas, even if they can't remember the words, or get them in the correct order, or stay on key, of solve the world crisis problems that are hidden in the meanings of phrases like ""5 golden rings"" or ""the psychological explanations of a partridge in a pear tree.""

Silly, and fun, Christmas humor only 24 minutes long. Perfect for a pause each of the 12 days of Christmas, or a surprise just after Christmas dinner for the whole family to enjoy.  Who knows, a hamster may even give you clues as to how to handle your own dinner indigestion, but don't count on it.

After 3 years of watching, I'm still laughing from the belly, and recommending this DVD to all.",1259798400,3,1835,4.5212121212121215

8139902,5,B000HIVINS,"Love, love, love this! It's a Christmas tradition every year. Big fan of Aardman and British comedy in general. The kids love it. The adults love. And with captions on, even the grandparents love it! Clever edited compilation of interview comments by the Great British Public paired with claymation animals in such a subtly humorous way that I see something new every time I watch it.",1484179200,,384,4.833333333333333
8139903,3,B000HIVINS,"This isn't bad, and has its clever moments, but you have to know what you're getting. As a fan of Wallace & Grommit, I thought this would be an irreverent British animated Christmas special, along the lines of other Aardman productions, and admit I was unfamiliar with the series premise, which, in case you are too, is taking actual interviews with ordinary Brits and animating them to come out of the mouths of dogs, birds, and other stop-motion animated creatures.

This doesn't totally lack charm, but it's basically a long-winded, 22-minute version of the 12 Days of Christmas song, with lots of mildly humorous, relatable chatter about Christmas thrown in. At about the five-minute-mark my oldest son, who was excited to watch this when he saw the cover, was like, 'What are we watching?' ... Now, there were certainly clever moments, but this is a much more adult -- mostly in its subtly, not due to any outright objectionable material  -- than anything I've seen before from Aardman and isn't especially festive either, despite the subject matter.

I'm an anglophile, who generally loves British TV, and even I didn't actually love this, finding it a bit tedious at less than halfway through; and given that it's only a 24-minutes, start to finish, that's not a great sign. I had gotten the joke, such as it was, and didn't think the additional repeated returns to each animal vignette/personal conversation added much to what I already knew about each archetype from the first five minutes. There were cute moments, but  it didn't strike me as terribly re-watchable, and definitely lacks even modest kid appeal.",1481673600,,1620,4.944852941176471

8139905,3,B000HIVINS,"This outing of Creature Comforts was not as good as the American version, but still a chuckler.  It was the British version of a Creature Comforts Christmas. The humor was dry and the creatures' accents were hard to understand. but then it was British. Still it was o.k.  It was definitely campy and I wouldn't recommend it for very young viewers.  I don't think it was made for children, but more for the adult ears.
The animated characters were really goofy and kind of unusual and unique.
It was Christmas from British animals point of view.",1426809600,,544,4.645833333333333
