8059492,4,B0009E389M,I liked it lot. Low expectations. Did not read the novel. The dread was parking garage threatening.,1412035200,,99,4.882352941176471
8059493,1,B0009E389M,I didn't like the movie at all. It went in the trash after it tried to watch it. It's such a wonderful novel. The movie was filled with drug references and lots of extra content that was not in the book. Bad acting and overdone drama.  A real disappointment.,1403481600,,258,4.26530612244898
8059494,3,B0009E389M,"This story by Stephen King ought to be more compelling and scary, but somehow it just drags on and never really accomplishes what it set out to do.  I don't fault the great cast, but I do fault the weak adaptation.  Maybe this is one of those books that just could not be adapted well.",1313712000,,285,4.163636363636364
