2670361,5,B000JF28GA,While Jennifer Aniston has starred in better films these three are worth watching.  Recommend them at a reasonable price.  Three for less than the price of one is very good.,1355961600,,173,4.733333333333333
2670362,5,B000JF28GA,"Love this movie! Young Aniston,Bacon and Mohr are a classic. Friends has taken her to the top! Bacon and Mohr icing on the cake.",1334966400,,128,4.375
2670363,5,B000JF28GA,"Three for one, great deal. Jennifer Aniston collection is a must for Aniston fans. It is a great way to look at her older work, she just seems to get better.",1281484800,,157,4.096774193548387
2670364,5,B000JF28GA,"This is a great collection for those of you just starting to learn to love Jen Aniston. She's The One is a decent film, but I have never been a big fan of it, and actually consider it her weakest movie, if not necessarily her weakest part!

Picture Perfect is a good RomCom that is enjoyable for us men and women should love it! Basic premise of ""sometimes what you were looking for is right in front of you"". But its a good bit of fun and stars the always enjoyable Kevin Bacon and a well casted Jay Mohr.

Object of my Affection is a VERY GOOD MOVIE. I'm a huge Paul Rudd fan (He steals the show in every Apatow flick), and here he plays a homosexual who becomes roommates with Aniston's character. Its really a well made movie, it never makes you feel too awkward about Rudd's sexuality, but does show many ways that people can learn to be happy despite their flaws.

Overall a good collection, esp. if you don't own Picture Perfect or Object of My Affection.",1255910400,8,962,4.303867403314917
2670365,1,B000JF28GA,"Surprized that this product is called a ""Collection"", when there are only three of Jennifer's earliest movies included.  What about: ""Office Space"", ""Derailed"", ""The Break Up"", ""The Good Girl"", ""Along Came Polly"", ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Rumor Has It"", ""Friends With Money"", ""Management"", ""Marley & Me"", and of course, ""Leprauchan"".

Weren't any of these worthy to be considered for the collection?? Apparently not.",1232409600,,410,5.704918032786885
2670366,3,B000JF28GA,"I bought this item hoping that the disc for ""Picture Perfect,"" one of my favorite romantic comedies, had been updated, but it hasn't.  Be warned that it is widescreen, but NOT enhanced for 16 by 9 TVs, so it is a small image with bars on the sides.  The other two films ARE enhanced for 16 by 9. I wish this information had been in the product description.",1172880000,9,356,4.220588235294118

8150123,5,B000JF28GA,Classic romantic movies starring my favorite star from the 90's.  Great to watch on rainy weekends.  They're not always funny and some are filled with emotional conflict,1392163200,,169,5.222222222222222
8150124,5,B000JF28GA,"As a huge fan of Jennifer, I found this collection to be terrific as usual. Jen  surprises but never disapoints.
