Amira, Crystal and the other dancers do a great job of showing beginners how to bond through dancing. It's sweet to watch and reinstills feminine power in an earthy, gentle and loving manner. Dancing, when done properly really helps people to connect to their core and with others. Highly recommended.",1390176000,,434,4.958904109589041
