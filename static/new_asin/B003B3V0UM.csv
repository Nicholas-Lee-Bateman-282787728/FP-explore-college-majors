4105023,5,B003B3V0UM,This movie got OK reviews when it opened and so I went to see it with my wife. We loved it. It has some great slapstick comedy elements combined with with some moments of real emotional truth.  Kristen Bell is a great actress and many members of the rest of the cast turned in fine performances as well.,1266192000,4,303,4.224137931034483
4105024,1,B003B3V0UM,"I'm not sure why I am even writing this review of ""When In Rome"". This 'offering' should be allowed to die the quick death it deserves and I fear that writing this review will only serve to keep it alive in the public's eye, prolonging the agony. Perhaps this review will help prevent people from wasting their time and money on the DVD. You can expect the DVD very, very soon.

I love a good romantic comedy. Unfortunately, so many of these films fall into two different categories. The recent ""Leap Year"" was so predictable and mediocre; it is difficult to remember much about it. Was John Lithgow in that film? Yes, for about five minutes. Is it the typical uptight-young-woman-seeking-commitment-goes-out-on-a-limb-for-her-partner-ends-up-in-foreign-country-and-meets-love-of-life? Of course, she initially has to hate the man who will become the love of her life. Yes, it is just like that. It seems like every January, we will now get a film with this basic concept. At least they are confining them and that will help us recognize them, keeping our distance. Last year, ""27 Dresses"" starring Katherine Heigl and James Franco and this year, ""Leap Year"" starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode.

""When in Rome"" is different, in a very discernible way. It is meant to be a flat out comedy but it just doesn't work on so many levels. Kristin Bell plays an art curator at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. She is a determined young woman, eager to excel in her job and try to please her uptight boss (Anjelica Huston). She learns her younger sister is getting married in Rome; she flies there and meets the best man (Josh Duhamel). While there, she takes five coins out of the Trevi Fountain, and naturally males living in New York threw in all five coins. When she returns home, she realizes she has captured the love of the five men and can't concentrate on building the relationship with the man she wants (Duhamel). So an endless parade of four whacked out guys (Danny DeVito plays the Sausage King, Dax Shepherd plays a model who likes to rip off his shirt to admire his body, Jon Heder plays a magician and Will Arnett plays an Italian artist) tries to get closer to Bell and, as a result, makes her life more difficult. But who does the fifth coin belong to?

If you really care, waste your money.

The biggest problem with ""Rome"" is the uneven nature of the film. Bell seems to be playing it straight, trying to create a real character, someone who might actually exist. Despite a brief moment of slapstick comedy at her sister's wedding, she just isn't funny. And the four men chasing her are just so off the wall; they don't match Bell's character or the tone of her performance. Worse, they aren't even funny. Shepherd's stick seems to be that he rips his shirt off at any opportunity and wants people to look at him. Arnett is a forlorn artist who has one of the worst wigs I have ever seen. DeVito seems to think saying ""Sausage King"" is enough to make his character funny. And Heder just does magic tricks and tries to appear mysterious. Later, the actor who played Pedro in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" pops up as Heder's assistant/ videographer. I'm sure someone somewhere thought this was a great idea, but it is just strange. Late in the film, Pedro pops up again and kind of winks at the camera.

Josh Duhamel is the most innocuous thing in the film. But as the leading man, should he be that forgettable? He was recently credited saying he would welcome a return to the television soap ""All My Children"". Interesting...

As I watched the film, I kept wondering about the director's previous works, thinking he probably had a background in television, it seems like all of the elements are drawn from that type of ethic and combined badly. Somehow, I wasn't surprised to learn Mark Steven Johnson wrote and directed ""Daredevil"" and ""Electra"".

As we left ""When in Rome"", my companion remarked that it seemed like they were trying to recreate the feel of the old Doris Day /Rock Hudson/ Tony Randall films. I can see that influence in this movie, but Johnson doesn't succeed.",1265846400,6,4084,4.7034965034965035

4105026,2,B003B3V0UM,"In Mark Steven Johnson's ""When in Rome,"" crisp, size negative 1 Kristin Bell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veronica-Mars-The-Complete-First-Three-Seasons/dp/B000SULWJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veronica Mars - The Complete First Three Seasons</a>) plays a cute workaholic curator for the Guggenheim Museum--you know the type--she's upset when she doesn't get cell coverage, has a natural cynicism regarding love, has a zany efficiency that borders on fanaticism yet always manages to pull it all together fashion-wise in a few seconds.  In short she is supposed to epitomize the strong workingwoman with a weakness for love in the typical romantic comedy.  Unfortunately as chin-up determined as she might be, she does not hold a candle to actresses like Melanie Griffith in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Working-Girl/dp/B0007IO6NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Working Girl</a>"" or even Rosalind Russell in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/His-Girl-Friday/dp/B00006RCLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">His Girl Friday</a>"" whose comedic timing and insouciant charm seem polished in comparison.

This observation, however, may not be due to any fault of Ms Bell's.  The script written by David Diamond and David Weissman attempts to be perky, sweet and LOL funny along the lines of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>"" but succeeds only in offering its audience a big screen version of made-for-TV Hallmark Movie Channel Family fare with stale jokes, stereotypical characters and goofball scenarios fueled by a supernatural occurrence that takes place in a love fountain in the Piazza Navona in the Eternal City.  Shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dolce-Vita-2-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dolce Vita (2-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and a poor man's Trevi!  As Beth, Ms. Bell really doesn't have a chance; she along with sister Joan (Alexis Dziena) and assistant Stacey (Kate Micucci) come off as being so incredibly young rather than the young professionals/newlyweds that they are costumed to be.  With such weak sugarcoated material their performances cannot be rated only enhanced with contrived overblown expressions more suitable to the stage than film.

The plot follows the usual rom/com formula where girl meets boy and then wonders for the duration of the film whether the boy in question (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Win-A-Date-With-Tad-Hamilton-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMYL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Win A Date With Tad Hamilton! (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;Josh Duhamel) actually has real feelings for her.  In ""When in Rome"" (which oddly takes place primarily in New York) when Beth does the reverse Trevi and pulls coins out of the fountain, little does she know that each coin is associated with a particular male looking for love.  In a series of whacky sequences that strain comedy to its limits, the four lovelorn men in question (Danny DeVito, Will Arnett, Jon Heder, and Dax Shepard) chase her about town to the point in which she needs to beat them off with a stick.  Although the fifth man, Nick played by Duhamel romantically dodges lightning bolts to be at her side, there is little development of his character.  In fact, we know little about Beth or Nick-their backgrounds are blank as are their dreams and aspirations.  We see Beth with her parents--the mother a bitter divorcee and her father played by a Don Johnson that has passed the point of wearing his scruffy Miami Vice stubble to any great advantage--but is her broken home to blame for her frenetic efficiency?  Her rather crazy move to get into a fountain in a foreign country in an evening gown?  The script has little depth beyond a contrived zaniness that gives the story no bearing.

Not that that is not okay. It all depends on the target audience and what they expect.  Two hours of whimsy?  `When in Rome' would have played better as ""High School Musical In New York and Europe.""  Then no question would arise as to its intended audience for surely, this film is geared towards a young adult crowd that enjoys a bit of magic a la Teen Witch mingled with G-rated Disneyesque romance. ""When in Rome's"" greatest failure is its pretence as a grown-up comedy.  The sophisticated writing that would give it the feel of a `Working Girl' or `Big Fat Greek Wedding' simply is not there.

Bottom Line?  ""When in Rome"" provides about an hour and a half of mundane entertainment for the less than 25-year-old set.  Leads Bell and Duhamel cannot be blamed for bad performances as the script does not afford them much range. Recommended for the lovers of family fare Hallmark Movie Channel style.

4105027,4,B003B3V0UM,"So, I realize that I am writing this right when it shows up in theaters, but I decided to go ahead and rate the movie based on the actual movie (not the DVD), because alot of times I will go on here to see what other people are saying about the movie, before I go see it.  So, I decided to do that for this movie.  :)

Overall, I enjoyed When in Rome.  It's a great chick-flick.

When in Rome tells the story of Beth (Kristen Bell) who, while visiting Rome for her younger sister's wedding, realizes that she may never actually settle down because no man has ever ranked above her job.  So, in a drunken craze, she visits the Fountain of Love and removes several coins from the fountain's water. This brings five guys (Will Arnett, Jon Heder, Dax Shepard, Danny Devito, and most importantly Josh Duhamel) into her life...all of whom have fallen madly in love with her.  She has to figure out a way to break this spell, while also trying to figure out whether or not some of those feelings may be for real.

As I said, overall it was an enjoyable movie.  It is one of those movies that you have to accept that it's not supposed to happen in real life.  I mean, it's all about magic and falling in love with the right people.  It does have funny enough parts to keep a guy entertained, but it is definitely a chick flick that I recommend. It made me want to visit Italy and find this so-called Fountain of Love.  :)",1264723200,41,1413,4.231343283582089

4105042,4,B003B3V0UM,"RELEASED IN 2010 and directed by Mark Steven Johnson, ""When in Rome"" stars Kristen Bell as Beth, a busy unlucky-in-love woman from New York City, who finally meets the man who can take her mind off work while vacationing in Rome (Josh Duhamel). Unfortunately Beth impulsively takes four coins from a reputed fountain of love, which magically attracts four suitors she doesnt want (Danny DeVito, Will Arnett, Jon Heder & Dax Shepard).

Speaking as someone who doesnt view many romcoms, I found this one quite watchable. Im not too familiar with Bell because Ive only seen her in two other films and they were minor roles (Burlesque and Scream 4), but she easily carries the movie with her star power, although she looks like she could use a few hamburgers.

The movie puts its best foot forward with the kinetic first act, which mostly takes place in Rome and is the most humorous part of the movie, and sometimes hilarious (e.g. the Cherry Pie joke). The mid-section loses steam a bit as things get too mushy, but the movie perks up again in the last act. Theres a memorable comical episode featuring a compact yellow European automobile. Jon Heders magician character, Lance, is the most engaging suitor while DeVitos character (eventually) arouses sympathy.

THE FILM RUNS 91 minutes and was shot in Rome, New York City and Santa Clarita, CA. WRITERS: David Diamond & David Weissman. ADDITIONAL CAST: Anjelica Huston plays Beths humorless boss while Peggy Lipton & Don Johnson play her parents. Kate Micucci and Bobby Moynihan are on hand as the potential couples best friends respectively. Alexis Dziena appears as Beths sister.

the plot

Beth is the work-a-holic type of career woman to the point where it ruined her last relationship.  Despite this, her supervisor, Celeste over at the Guggenheim still drives her to work even harder.  So it pains Beth that she has to leave for Rome, Italy to be maid of honor at her hot sister Joan's wedding right in the middle of when she should be planning the upcoming fundraising art exhibit for the museum's patrons.

Beth has a lousy time initially as her family paints her as the old maid as her younger sister ties the knot.  The groom's best man, Nick comes in late and Beth is instantly smitten by her wedding counterpart.  They seem to get along, and there is a noticable spark between them.  As the night draws on, she notices Nick getting cosy with some hot leggy brunette.  As Beth is quite drunk now, she heads into the Fountain of Love right outside of the recption hall and begins heckling the statue of Venus who is reportedly granting wishes of love to those who toss their coins in her fountain.  Beth's grand idea is to save the expectations of love from those who threw coins into the fountain by taking four of them back to New York City.

That crazy love goddess Venus grants the wishes of these five men, but in reverse. These four dudes are now in love with Beth.  They travel from Rome to NYC to be near her and they try to court her.  The four men consist of a magician, an artist, a sausage manufacturer, a model and Nick.  Comedy ensues as we witness these four men under the spell of Venus trying to hopelessly woo the unsuspecting Beth.

the breakdown

Romantic Comedies, in my opinion are the easiest genre of films to take in.  It could be even a halfway pleasant way to spend your time even if the movie's not that good.  Yet there's something nice and relaxing about watching two very attractive people get together eventually.  Don't get me wrong, When In Rome isn't one of the very horrible, some scenes are actually very funny.  Yet if there is something that gets in the way, it's the premise.  I can swallow the whole fantasy aspect of the Venus fountain of love casting spells of devotion on people who have faith in their coins and the water.  Yet, it doesn't make sense why the lead character would steal these selected coins, and then take them home.  Is it because she was drunk?  Is it because she was so disenchanted with even the idea of love that she needed to engage in some sort of revenge plot against the statue?  I think it's just a case of lazy writing and a lack of ideas to find a more plausible way for the lead character to take these coins in her posession so that some strange men would follow her around.  The writers, Davids Weismman and Diamond have injected their magical plots before with great success in a film like The Family Man for isnstance.

However, within the big picture this is but a small hurdle to jump in order to enjoy the film.  First off if I'm going to be honest, then I admit the main draw for me is the lovely Kristin Bell.  An actress I have never appreciated much until I saw her in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  As a bonus, Bell's onscreen hot sister was portrayed by the very petitely-sexy Alexis Dziena.  I guess I should also admit that I also enjoyed the movie despite another personal hurdle of mine - Danny Devito.  This is an actor I just detest, and luckily for me his screen time was substantially limited.  He probably couldn't stay sober long enough to be any real use for the filmmakers.

Happily, the best aspect of the movie was the laughs.  When In Rome has a stockpile of big laughs aimed right at your funny bone.  The cast is a group of very funny actors, Will Arnet plays Antonio, the Italian artist who has dreams of Beth and paints her in the nude constantly, one time in an extremely large scale on the side of an apartment building.  Dax Shepard as Gale, the male model was my favorite.  Only a spell cast by Venus can possibly match his overt self-love, and even then I think that he wins that contest.  Jon Heder as the street magician who seems to be more annoying than impressive as far as his illusions are concerned.  Danny Devito as Al the sausage guy just seemed awkward and out of place as he chases this young Beth around, and not in a funny way, but in an exceedingly creepy way.  The funny scenes that stand out for me have to do with the upscale restaurant that Nick takes Beth to.  You eat in total darkness in order that your other senses are heightened.  The other really funny scene is when five adults somehow squeeze into one of these teeny Italian cars and even drive it into the Guggenheim and take the elevator while still in the car.

The show is rated PG-13 for some language, the illustrated nudity (courtesy of Antonio the artist), and some light suggestive themes.  Once you get past the absurdity of the actual premise, I am betting that you'll enjoy When In Rome.

Also, Anjelica Huston was perfect as her dragon-lady boss.

Josh Duhamel did the romancing with such ease and came off so well it makes me wish I was his wife.

The movie took place in Rome and I have been in Rome and that was a great back drop for the movie to take place in for me.  The subtext was ridiculous and yet delightful at the same time.
In real time there is no way that one can walk into the fountains and yet the film industry finds ways to allow the scenario to take place and the idea of picking up coins and what takes place after that is just plain goofy.  The movie stars that they had in the film carried it and it was thoroughly entertaining.",1386288000,,596,4.076923076923077

However, it needs a cohesive plot that has something going for it like a little substance.  This plot just seemed a tad silly, and wasn't entertaining to me. Didn't find it that humorous.  Did enjoy the scenery in Rome and some of the older actors like Anjelica Huston.  Maybe I wasn't the right audience for it.

4105371,1,B003B3V0UM,"Talk about lame! I can't categorize this as a Comedy because despite all the pratfalls, embarrassing situations, ridiculous blunders and walking into things, this pathetic movie is NOT funny. I hesitate to call it a Romance because the hero seems more in love with himself than with the heroine. (It's always a mistake to cast a hero prettier than the woman he's supposed to fall for.)

Here are some of the lambs led to this particular slaughter:
  * Kristen Bell (""Couples Retreat"") is our toothy heroine who goes to Rome for her sister's wedding and steals some coins from a fountain. Uh oh, this means a magic spell in reverse: Any coin retrieved from this fountain will cause the owner to fall in love with the person who retrieved it.
  * Josh Duhamel (""Transformers"" 1 and 2) meets her at that wedding and is instantly smitten (is it possible to be too pretty?).
  * Don Johnson (""Bastardi"") is the oft-married father of the bride.
  * Peggy Lipton (LOTS of TV) is the divorced (and bitter) mother of the bride.
  * Will Arnett (LOTS of TV) is a would-be painter whose coin our gal steals from the fountain, so he is instantly smitten and sets out in hot pursuit of the new love of his life.
  * Danny DeVito (""Get Shorty"") is the Sausage King, another victim of our heroine's thievery; he is uncredited and doesn't claim this movie in his rsum...I can hardly blame him!
  * Jon Heder (""Napoleon Dynamite"") is a struggling magician; his coin too, was stolen from the fountain so he joins the lovelorn posse chasing our gal.
  * Anjelica Huston (""The Kreutzer Sonata"") is our much-pursued heroine's New York boss at the art museum.

Both Duhamel and the Guggenheim are nice to look at. ...sigh....",1375488000,3,1703,4.638795986622074

They both LOVE weddings & dressing up so I think that's what really catches their attention. I also think it's the unrealistic misshaps that she experiences (like her heel breaking & the vase NOT breaking)

 But as a warning the ""illusionist"" does a trick that w/out a parent there to point out it's a prop & not real-could freak a kid out. Also, the scene with her sister that just got married & her new husband cooking w ""just"" aprons is in there, but they are behind a counter and covered so my kids have not noticed they do not have clothes on, in fact I didn't realize that until we watched it the second time.

For example, one of the suitors is a street magician, so he will always try to do crazy magic tricks to impress the protagonist.  A lot of the comedy seems to come from the interactions of these crazed, cliched suitors with each other and the protagonist.

4105456,1,B003B3V0UM,"The bottom line is that `When in Rome' is just very unfunny.  It's kind of `un' everything.  In fact, I can't really think of a single aspect of the film worth praising.  The storyline itself is overused and underdeveloped.  The character development is a joke and, well...as I'm typing this I'm realizing that all of this is exactly what I should have expected.  Still, I wanted it to be charming and funny, and neither Kristen Bell or Josh Duhamel are either of those things (an angry mob of lonely women just disagreed with my assessment of Duhamel's charm, but notice that I didn't say he wasn't good looking, I said he wasn't charming...and I'm right).

The film tells the story of a loveless woman named Beth.  She is an events coordinator who is wholly obsessed with her work as a way to deflect the hurt and pain of relationships.  At her sisters `spur of the moment' wedding in Rome, Beth meets an attractive man named Nick who happens to share her feelings on certain matters and soon the two of them are having a weird `Cinderella and Prince Charming' moment under the stars when she decides to let down her guard.  Then she (obviously) sees him kiss another woman and she hates all men again.  In a drunken conversation with a statue, Beth decides to pick up some coins in a well and put them in her purse.  As legend has it, the coins carry with them the love and affections of the men who tossed them in the well.  Soon a flock of crazy men are chasing Beth all over the city trying to declare their love for her.  So is Nick.  She falls back in love with him only to discover that one of the coins she picked out of the well was actually one of Nick's poker chips.

He must be under a weird spell and not actually love her, but of course he really does and they do get back together; duh.

If only this movie had some spunk to make up for the sheer stupidity of the script.  Instead we have a sea of mediocrity as Bell and Duhamel bore their way through manufactured chemistry.  I'm glad that better actors weren't cast in this (because the film is so stupid) but better actors would have made it more palatable.  Anjelica Huston needs a new agent (what is up with her lately) and Jon Heder needs to stop playing himself in every movie (we get it).  Dax Shepard was the ONLY part of this movie that made me laugh, and that is saying a lot about the quality of this mess.

Oh yeah, and Danny DeVito is in this; if that means anything anymore.

There is one thing that really got me.  Lee Pace is in this movie (for a split second in the very beginning).  It pains me that he doesn't have a brilliant career yet with more opportunities for him to just sink his teeth into important work.  What he did in `The Fall' is pure genius.  The man deserves better than this slop, but then again, he checked out real early so maybe he knew better.

In fact, you might say there's none at all because Kristen Bell's character insists on *denying* love at every single turn. That actually makes When In Rome a refreshingly different take on the romantic comedy genre.

Anyway, when Kristen Bell's character becomes so frustrated with herself for her inability to find true love, she takes a walk outside during her sisters wedding in Rome and takes these magic love-hungry coins from a nearby water fountain. Immediately four different men are instantly attracted to her and follow her around everywhere. That's pretty much the basis for the entire film.

One woman can't possibly find true love from FOUR different men, right? Well you'll see what happens! Those coins she took plays a big part in the storyline progression.

Her acting performance is really good too. She constantly makes jokes at all the appropriate moments, so solid job to the movie writers for delivering a quality film.

I like the two leads a lot and thought they did fine, but the film was a little like watching a play put on by over earnest drama students wanting to produce a quirky take on the rom com and I just didn't get caught up in it as I usually would with this genre.

I am not a rom com snob (love some of the most cheesy movies going - 27 dresses anyone)? but this is just really badly done and I am shocked that they managed to drag so many talented people into one bad bad movie...don't waste your time and instead rent something cheesy but quality...this will just leave you bored and uninspired.",1289088000,,966,4.239130434782608

Moderately charming because the plot is this: Beth (Kristen Bell) heads to Rome to her impulsively in-love sister's speedy wedding. While there, Beth, a fish out-of-water with jet lag, flirts a bit with the best man (Duhamel), then discovers that he might just be like all men, and then responds by drunkenly fishing ""love"" coins from a fountain and taking them back to New York. The coins call to the men who unloaded the coins in hopes of finding true love, men who are now linked to her via that true love. Enter John Heder, Danny DeVito, Dax Shepard and Will Arnet.  While dealing with four admirers and five coins, Beth, also tries to juggle a huge event at the museum, and the fear of the unknown, her feelings, the actions from those feelings and heart of the suspected fifth coin owner.

Heftily cheesy: physical humor, besotted men trying to outdo each other in the adoration department, a relationship that moves way too fast to be real and so on.

Big old heart. Just like all good sitcoms, this one does get resolved in the time frame....though the time frame got a bit long heading toward closure.

Overall decent. Not award winningly good, or must see, but if you are just in that kind of mood. If nothing else you can laugh at the antics for being either honestly amusing or over the top annoyingly ridiculous.",1289001600,,1440,4.609375

Kristen Bell and Josh Duhamel have no chemistry. Plain as that. What we see are rehearsed lines and emotions straight from the script. Some would call it bad acting. Kristen Bell is as interesting as (and also looks like) a tub of plain yogurt. The supporting cast is unlikeable as well and no one here just really seems to fit the roles they have been assigned. This movie is seriously miscast and because of that, it feels forced and artificial. The plot is even more plastic and rehearsed, as you have two characters fall in love with each after about essentially no more than 5 sentences exchanged. And the best part is that the entire rest of this movie is based on this staged, phony 3 line exchange.

Josh Duhamle's character acts like a dim witted, shallow dolt with the personality and charm of a door knob. He basically just looks good and you hope he doesnt open his mouth. Kristen Bell constantly looks like she is in rehearsal mode and never seems to really relax and get into her character and express her from the inside out. I could almost feel the film crew stand next to them. Dont even ask about Duhamle's obsessive, psycho behavior that in real life would make any sane woman run. Seriously, does anyone find it a turn on or romantic if a man they have just known for ten minutes chases them around town and confesses his soul and love to them?

I give movies from the past like My Man Godfrey or the Fred/Ginger movies a pass, but in the 2000s, it's not enough. I don't even necessarily need to see it on screen, it just would be nice to know that time had passed. Maybe change seasons or flash a ""6 months"" later. And the fact that ((((SPOILER ALERT))))  he wasn't even under the curse makes less believable. On top of that, there was a wedding!

Anyway, like I mentioned, the potential was there. Kristin and Josh had great chemistry. I thought there were too many extra characters. For example, Nick's friend who really served no purpose. Same for Beth's assistant. The slapstick was OK and not too much to bear. Dax Shepherd's (?) character was annoying. I didn't even recognize Napoleon D at first. Danny DeVito always makes me chuckle.

It could have been a good one. It wasn't all bad, but there were definitely more cringe-worthy moments than desired. The thing is, I really have nothing against the predictability of RomComs. In fact, I watch them because they're feel-good movies. But this was not a well-done one.",1284076800,,1656,4.743055555555555

So we have Magic coins making people fall in love with total strangers, thunder, lightening, irritating supporting cast and a song and dance finale probably inspired by 'Slumdog Millionaire'.The acting, story and direction are below average.

Danny DeVito, Dax Shepard (hilarious), Jon Heder, Will Arnett and Josh Dumel are now under a love spell.  Plenty of comical situations ensue.

The film is directed by Mark Steven Johnson (""Ghost Rider"", ""Daredevil"", ""Simon Birch"") and a screenplay by writing duo David Diamond and David Weissman (""Old Dogs"", ""Minutemen"", ""The Family Man"").

Colors tend to showcase earthtones and blues but for the most part, the film looks gorgeous especially during Beth's trip to Rome.  The only thing is that during closeups, I was expecting to see more detail but overall, the picture quality is very good for this film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""When In Rome"" is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Although the film is dialogue and music driven, there is a good use of surround sound for crowd ambiance and especially near the end when the thunderstorms hit New York City.  But for the most part, dialogue is clear from the center channels and music from the front channels are dynamic and definitely sounds great via lossless.

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""When in Rome"" is a romantic comedy that has its times of beauty and fun but its underachieving plot and cliche-filled, farfetched storyline makes the film more silly than enjoyable.

If there is one thing we learned from Kristin Bell films, she has appeared in comedies but here characters are are not known to deliver the comedy. For ""When in Rome"", Bell does a great job alongside Duhamel.

The problem is that their characters are not utilized as much into the screenplay as one would hope and the story keeps shifting to all these other characters that the comedy becomes fine for the first half but then becomes overly lame for its second half.

One scene features both Beth and Nick on their first date going to a restaurant that is pitch black with only the employees sporting night vision goggles.  What could have been an enlightening dinner, becomes a mess.  Who in their right mind, would want to go to a restaurant with no lighting.  I'm sure the writers could have come up with something much better.

As for the comedy, bringing the comedy are Josh Duhamel who tries to bring some of that vaudeville style of comedy as a former football athlete who was struck by lightning and now a journalist.  For a guy so suave and reserved, it's hard to believe he is very clumsy.  Granted, Duhamel shows he can do comedy but for most of the film, the writers tease the viewer to thinking he has a chance, he doesn't have a chance and keeps switching back and forth.  As mentioned, it would have been great if the film had focus on the two major characters but instead, we have to watch Beth deal with four goofballs.

As for the suitors (the goofballs), I expected to see a bit more perversion from Danny DeVito (who shows us that he can do so much more on ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") and Dax Shephard who typically plays comedy-based roles without a name, gets to play the wannabe model who's only major ad campaign was for gas relief.  Catching your attention is Jon Heder as the creepy magician as the ""Napoleon Dynamite"" star is reunited with Efren Ramirez who plays his videographer Juan and literally a character similar to his ""Napoleon Dynamite"" character Pedro.  And then there is Will Arnett as the Italian artist who keeps painting or drawing nudes of Beth.  Once again, the laughs are good but with Kristin Bell playing the character of ""Sarah Marshall"" in two films and you see comedy being pushed to another level, I suppose I was expecting to see DeVito strip down (like the ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" special) or to see something far out and unexpected.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen.

Interesting enough, aside from Efren Ramirez having a guest role, we also see Don Johnson playing Beth's father, Shaquille O'Neal and Lawrence Taylor in the film.  Fortunately, O'Neal and Taylor's role were quite limited.

If anything, I felt that aside from the beautiful location shots, ""When In Rome"" suffers from too many characters with a script that doesn't utilize them effectively.  Personally, ""When in Rome"" could have easily been a much more interesting film without the suitors and focused on ""fate"" between Beth and Nick.

Sure, it's contrived and cliche but it could have been better than what we are given in this screenplay.  And if you watched the alternative opening and ending, you won't believe what else the writers had planned for this film.  In fact, if anything, I felt that there was more vitality at the music number used for the credits than what we see in the entire film.

Overall, ""When in Rome"" is an OK romantic comedy if one wanted to watch a film with a significant other to pass time.  The  Blu-ray does have a good amount of special features but in the end, the film was lackadaisical romantic comedy at best.",1279238400,,7036,4.758677685950413

Kristen Bell stars as Beth a curator at the Guggenheim who seems to have everything but a relationship. While in Rome for her sister's wedding she steals five coins from the Fountain de Amore and returns home to find that the owner's are madly in love with her. It is from this premise that Johnson constructs his film.

The suitors include sportswriter Nick (josh Duhamel),Artist Antonio (Will Arnett), magician Lance (Jon Heder), model Gale (Dax Shepard) and businessman Al (Danny DeVito). For the majority of the film the suitors are one dimensional but DeVito turns in a good cameo performance.

""When in Rome,"" directed by Mark Steven Johnson, is a flop from start to finish. The entire concept is ludicrous. Beth (Bell), an unlucky-in-love, New York art museum curator, travels to Rome for her sister's wedding. In despair over her own lack of romance, she grabs five coins out of a ""fountain of love,"" creating some kind of spell in which the gentlemen who threw the coins fall in love with her and pursue her back to New York. She likes Nick (Josh Duhamel), but mistakenly believes he's under the spell and not acting of his own accord. In the end, Beth realizes her error and she and Nick find everlasting happiness.

This film doesn't fail because of Kristen Bell. She's as cute as a button and employs all of those familiar facial expressions that endeared her to fans of Veronica Mars. The girl's got looks and smarts. Neither can you blame the excellent, big-name supporting cast; try Anjelica Huston, John Heder, Polish American Alexis Dziena, Peggy Lipton, Danny DeVito, and Don Johnson. The performances of SNL comedian, Bobby Moynihan, and Dax Shepard are two of the movie's few funny, bright spots.

No, this film fails so miserably because the plot is ridiculous beyond comprehension. I was constantly checking the DVD time tracker to see how many more minutes of torture I had to endure watching this bust. What were you thinking, Kristen?

Kristen Bell plays a working woman who finds her job much more rewarding than any relationship she can find.  It doesn't mean she isn't sad nothing has worked out with the men in her life.  It just means that she can feel rewarded standing on her own two feet.  Hello, am I connecting with the female population yet?  She is a lead curator at the Guggenheim museum and just when she concedes to living a life of solitaire, her sister decides to get married and things go a little haywire.  So off to Rome she flies for a weekend of family hell.

While in the romantic city she picks a few coins out of a fountain and unknowingly captures the hearts of some lucky dudes who had previously dropped them in the mysterious fountain.  While the magic is working its way towards insanity she meets Josh Duhamel who happens to actually like her.  The two of them make a great pair.  As corny as the scene is with breaking the vase and short circuiting the electricity, it actually made me laugh.  Without giving too much away, the commercials do that all too well already, I will say that several scenes had me laughing pretty loud at times.  It really was a funny movie, even if it was a little trite and predictable.

In my book Dax Shepard was absolutely hilarious with his washboard stomach.  He spent most of the movie with his shirt off as he looked at himself almost as much as he sat admiring Kristen Bell.  How this guy is not cast in more movies is beyond me, but we can continue to enjoy his work next season in Parenthood.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie.  If you go in expecting a nice romantic comedy with several funny scenes you will leave happy.  It isn't anything ground breaking and there is no thought involved.  It is simply 91 minutes of mindless entertainment where everything works out in the end.  What more can you ask from a movie of this nature.  In my book it delivered, so have a few laughs and move on to the next one.  Hollywood has been making these since the moving picture was invented, and it will continue as long as people buy the tickets to see them.  I for one think it was adequately worth the price.",1277337600,58,2700,4.393145161290323

4105516,3,B003B3V0UM,My husband and I watched this movie yesterday and it was a pretty cute little romantic comedy. It's one of those totally predictable ones so don't expect surprises if you see it. I would give it three stars.,1277164800,2,207,4.473684210526316
4105517,3,B003B3V0UM,"I've almost just about had it with all these romantic comedies postulating that beautiful girls are so dang unlucky in love, that they can't land a dude. Although, okay, to turn it around, I don't really want to watch a flick featuring an absolute bow-wow who's unlucky in love, so I guess I know where the cinema industry is coming from. For instance, WHEN IN ROME happens to star Kristen Bell instead of, say, Rachel Dratch. So it makes more sense when, in the movie, a vain male model informs Kristen Bell: ""I don't know whether to look at my own reflection or you. That's how beautiful you are!"" Kristen Bell is easy on the old eyeballs.

Kristen Bell plays Beth Martin, a harried curator at the Guggenheim musem. Beth is dedicated to her career more so than to any boyfriend, and this is why her latest beau had dumped her a year ago. And yet Beth can't help but fixate on her dismal love life, so it's more a downer when she learns that her baby sister is set to wed this dashing Roman after a mere two weeks' acquaintance. Beth flies to the Eternal City for the ceremony. Things happen. She ends up wallowing in self-pity in the famous Fontana de Amore, where all romantics toss in coins and wish for love. The plot gets going when Beth, inebriated and not buying what the Fountain of Love's selling, plucks five coins from the fountain. So take that, Fountain of Love. Beth wasn't aware of the legend.

Legend has it that the Fountain's magical flow is reversed when a coin is taken from the Fountain, that whoever absconds with that coin then becomes the target of love from whoever had originally tossed in the coin. Back home in New York, Beth Martin is suddenly beset (I guess ""courted"" is another word) by five weird guys: a street magician (Jon Heder), a tortured Italian painter (Will Arnett), a self-absorbed male model (Dax Shepard), a sausage mogul (Danny DeVito), and an accident-prone sports reporter (Josh Duhamel) who once was struck by lightning. Of these five, Nick the sports reporter comes off as the most normal. The film doesn't at all try to be subtle in fingering Nick as the guy we should root for.

I had never heard of WHEN IN ROME until I saw the DVD release, and so maybe alarms should've been going off in the old noggin. I got this DVD based on Kristen Bell being the lead, and Kristen Bell has amassed tons of good will from me for her time on the addictive, gone-too-soon VERONICA MARS. Kristen's appeal is still very much evident on the big screen. She's a fine comedienne and she's beautiful, and it's not enough. Not when she's framed in an inert screenplay that embarrassingly tries too hard for the obvious laughs. It undermines all the good things Bell brings to the table.

One of the biggest snafus, I think, is that the film peppers in too many uninteresting, unfunny oddball personalities. Beth's offbeat best friend and Nick's best friend seem like they're there only because the romantic comedy formula calls for an offbeat buddy. More tellingly, Beth's suitors seem more creepy than quirky and sweet. Excepting Nick, these guys come off more like stalkers. In one scene Jon Heder's street magician breaks into Beth's apartment, and that's creepy enough. But when his buddy Pedro from NAPOLEON DYNAMITE tags along to record the proceedings, it really becomes this disturbing $#!+, man. And the first thing that struck me when Beth amscrayed with those five coins from the Fountain: what if one of those coins had belonged to a woman? That would've been a nice reveal.

Thru some unforeseen twist - because I don't think the screenplay writers intended this at all - the funniest person - for me, anyway - turns out to be that deadpan waitress at Beth and Nick's blackout restaurant date. She's only onscreen for a few minutes. On the other hand, Josh Duhamel's comedic contribution amounts to his character habitually walking into poles.

The picture never does work out the height differential between Bell and Duhamel, and so there are times when they just look awkward on screen simply because of his towering over her by a foot or so. At least Duhamel wasn't shown alone with Alexis Dziena who plays Kristen's younger sister. Dziena is even tinier than Kristen. WHEN IN ROME draws 3 stars out of 5 from me, and I think I'm being generous. I still got love for Kristen Bell. Just, please, don't show her again with lettuce on her teeth. What is this, I Love Lucy?

For better Kristen Bell flicks, go check out FIFTY PILLS, GRACIE'S CHOICE, and FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL. And there's always VERONICA MARS. Heck, I even liked PULSE.",1276992000,,4584,4.665841584158416

But she dutifully jets over to Italy for the wedding to be her sister's maid of honor and almost connects with the best man, Nick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Josh-Duhamel/dp/B000N3AW6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Josh Duhamel</a>), with his limited ability to translate English into Italian.  In a moment of drunken despair, Beth climbs into the ""fountain of love"" (think a fictional&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trevi-Fountain/dp/B000LJQ6NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trevi Fountain</a>), and randomly picks up five coins, one of which is a poker chip, to ""save"" the pitiful souls who tossed them in to find love.  However, Beth then learns that according to legend, if you take coins from the fountain, the owner of the coin will fall in love with you.  Unfortunately, Beth learns this when she is back in  New York, and, in one of those remarkable coincidences that are all too often the staple of such films, it turns out that the owners of those coins are in the Big Apple too.  Not only that, they all cross Beth's path and begin professing their undying love.  Wackiness ensues.

It was interesting to watch ""When In Rome"" on DVD the same week we watched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leap-Year/dp/B0038N9X3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leap Year</a>,"" because both movies are ultimately disappointing romantic comedies, but I feel better about this one with Kristen Bell than I did about the one with Amy Adams, even though as a rule I tend to be more disdainful of the sillier movie.  It might have to do with the expectations game.  I was expecting more from ""Leap Year,"" and less from ""When in Rome,"" so the film that exceeded expectations is going to stand out against the film that failed.  Bell's Beth is in the pivotal role of being pretty much the sanest person in the movie, while the insanity swirls around her, and she never really seems to notice that in the sanity department Nick is a close second.  Beth says she does not believe in magic any more than she believes in love, but she is quick to jump to the conclusion about the former while putting off second thoughts regarding the latter.  Basically the plot complications and comic confusion in this film are what passes for the impediments to the leads living happily ever after sooner rather than later.

Screenwriters David Diamond and David Weissman teamed up in the past to write ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Man/dp/B00005JCCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Man</a>,"" so there is a bit of a disconnect as to how they could have forgotten to give this 2010 film more of a heart, although it gets close when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Danny-DeVito/dp/0783226926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Danny DeVito</a>'s character explains what you have to do for someone you really love (even if the real love is induced by magic).  When a film's big finish hinges on the audience not recognizing that one poker chip looks the same as two other poker chips, that is not a good sign.  Once again we have a movie that it set up for the sort of ""grand gesture"" that I require in my romantic comedies, but this film fails to deliver and the fault lies at the feet of the screenwriters and not director Brett Ratner, who also helmed ""The Family Man.""  That was not a great movie, but it was a lot more solid than this one.  Also, while I am throwing stones, the cover art of Bell for the DVD does not acurately reflect her character.  That might be the way Bell is, especially when she breaks into dance moves when scenes become fodder for the blooper real, but that ain't what Beth is like.

There are some laughs in this one, not only because&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Will-Arnett/dp/B000XJ5TOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Will Arnett</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jon-Heder/dp/B00005JNBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jon Heder</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dax-Shepard/dp/B000M9CB4W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dax Shepard</a>&nbsp;play the other silly suitors, but also because some of the silliness actually works, or, maybe, I am just a sucker for putting half the cast in a tiny car, especially if that car ends up not only going forward but up.  I also happen to like it when the cast gets together in the end credits of a comedy and boogies; there can be more of that in those sort of films these days.  Still, there will be some who be more annoyed by the zaniness, even with Bell providing a solid anchor in the tradition of Mary Tyler Moore.  Ironically, the biggest laugh we had from a movie this year came while watching this film, but that was only because as Beth was about to give a verbal coup de gras to her most annoying suitor, I actually said the line out loud right before she did.

Unknowingly, by taking 5 coins from the Fountain of Love during a drunken romp, she causes 5 men to fall madly in love with her. All 5 follow her back to America and stalk her...until she is able to return the coins to them to break the spell. Although she loves Nick, she discovers that his love might have been caused by one of the coins; should she return the coin to him or live without fear that he will leave her? The plot is very predictable, so not a lot of surprises, but the comedy from her suitors as they attempt to impress her provides most of the hijinks here. Heder as an amateur Criss Angel magician is definitely the funniest of the bunch.

Overall, the film is enjoyable even if predictable; a little uneven, it goes from insightful comedy & drama into downright stupidity all in the same scene. In the hands of a more experienced director, this one really could have been much better and with the talented cast, it's a real crime that the opportunity for perfection was missed. I would recommend this movie mainly to the teen/early 20's group who seems to have really enjoyed it the most.

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Romantic Comedy
Release Date: 29 January 2010
Review Date: 21 March 2010

Kristen Bell is adorable and Josh Duhamel is a blast and their chemistry together was entertaining; but I wish I'd seen it in a different film. When in Rome is just one more romantic comedy to give me less hope for this genre that's tragically desperate for some creative new ideas.

Kristen Bell is our character of highest interest in the film as Beth. She is a career woman with no time for a man in her life, as a busy art curator for a big museum in New York.

She manages to sneak away for a brief moment to Rome however, for her sister's wedding. At this wedding, she meets the charming man, whom she isn't aware, is no doubt the one of her dreams. Duhamel plays the leading man, Nick.

Despite Nick's more than obvious immediate interest in Beth, she is oblivious to this and finds herself drunk and complaining that no-one will ever love her. She ends up at a majestic touristy water fountain in the streets of Rome, where she removes five coins from its watery temple. The second she does this, five guys immediately fall in love with her. Well four for sure, the other may have already been headed down that road on his own and besides - he threw a poker chip into the fountain rather than a coin, so does this really count? The fifth guy is of course, Nick.

When Beth goes back home to New York, she is soon stalked by all five men, to include Nick, although he does so in a more subtle and somewhat charming fashion. The other four guys yearning for her attention are played by Danny DeVito, Dax Shepard, Jon Heder and Will Arnett.

DeVito plays a sweet famous sausage king; Shepard is a hilarious male model who is absolutely full of himself; Heder is a screw-ball magician who will bother you but make you grin; and Arnett plays a loony Italian artist. All of them grovel over her and naturally, she only has eyes for Nick, but of course can't let him onto that, because -well, the movie would be over, I guess.

I'm not sure why the film needed to have these four psychos following Beth's every move, but on the other hand what would have taken their place? Maybe they added to the film in some obscure way. I do get the feeling that they all had more depth to them than our two main characters, and that is just as ridiculous as the four of them in general.",1271808000,2,2603,4.413361169102297
