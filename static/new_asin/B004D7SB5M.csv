A fun taco western  4*

This one started off a bit slowly -- or at least it took me  a while to get into the spirit of things -- but along about halfway through it began to get genuinely interesting, as well as simple fun.  There is a level at which it is a modernized spoof of, or maybe homage to, spaghetti westerns and 60's action shows, with dramatic posturing and showdowns, low camera angles and Sergio Leone style music, but there is also serious plot, and a simple good hearted core.

The amiable bear of a man Don Angel and his sidekick the dwarf Chema are living out their retirement from the world of professional wrestling (where Angel was ""El Fantastico"")  in a small town, showing the  cheesy old action films they starred in to the  local kids at the ""Cinema Fantastico,"" i.e. their living room. It's a pleasant, if minimalist, life, though the town does have its problems, including El Nahual, ""an entity of fire""  whose eerie call can be heard at all hours, terrorizing the town people, or at least those not modern enough to scoff at it as Don Angel does.

One day, pretty young Yadira shows up, lugging her suitcases down the dusty road from the bus stop.  Angel and Chema greet her as old friends, but with the sad news that her mother has died while she was absent, the letters telling of her illness taking months to catch up with the  transient.  When her mother's house has been vandalized (which they blame on the police), they ask Yadira to stay with them. But their third roommate is the young Juan who has also recently returned, and the tension between him and Yadira is thick, with hints that something happened between them before they left.

There are also:  the corrupt chief of police Dionisio, beefy and sleazy and after Yadira's virtue; Juan's buddy Julio; and Father Miguel, who supports his church selling charms against El Nahual.

Then Julio is shot (a minor leg wound) while he and Juan are hunting El Nahual, various people vanish into the clutches of the evil fiend, and .... it's time for the resurrection of El Fantastico, complete with cape, mask and spandex!  Let the fun begin.

The film has much of the look and feel of an awkward, low budget indie, with the actors at times hamming it up like the callowest of high school drama students, but there are definite subtleties as well.  The prickly relation between Yadira and Juan is nicely developed (and eventually explicated).  There are at least the following levels of reality:  the unspecified narrator who interjects occasionally (is this supposed to be Chema?), regular old reality, the old movies shown by Angel and Chema, flashbacks, and dreams.

For some reason this film hasn't made it to IMDB.  The listed cast are (with my best guesses as to characters played in parentheses):  Rogelio Guerra (with a long list of credits going back to the 1960's, he must be Don Angel), Ivonne Montero (Yadira), Julio Casado (?Juan?), Roger Arroyo (since he appeared in a Bonanza episode titled ""Hoss and the Leprechauns"", I'd bet on Chema), Raymundo Pastor, Moises Ivan Mora, and Jose Antonio Coro.  The DVD production, though clean, has no extras beyond subtitles.  The very title of the film is confused:  Per the film itself, it reads ""El Fantastico VS El Najual"", simple enough and very like the title of one of the films Chema and Don Angel show the kids.  On the DVD jacket, it's shortened to El Nahual, and Amazon further shortens it to Nahual.  The subtitles are adequate and readable, though clearly not by a native English speaker, with numerous spelling errors and other little dissonances.  In particular, I wish Don Angel's stage name, ""El Fantastico"", had simply been left alone (we English speakers could figure it out, and it resonates very nicely) or been slightly altered to ""Mr. Fantastic"" instead of just plain ""[The] Fantastic"".",1301788800,,3906,4.7407407407407405
