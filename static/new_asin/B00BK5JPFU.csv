8569813,5,B00BK5JPFU,"I have integral cycles of Bruckner under  Karajan, Furtwangler, Wand, Tintner, Jochum, besides some symphonies with Celibidache, Solti, Baremboim.  I had promised to myself not to buy more Bruckner, since I thought it would be impossible to bring a new Brucknerian sense of interpretation .  I was wrong.  Thielemann has shaken my soul,mind and body.
I am fond of slow speed provided it does not fall in inorganic pulse, as Celi did in Eighth.
 Well, we have here 74 minutes in no. 4  and 73 in no. 7, almost ten minutes more than usual.  The conductor, however, achieves to keep his ship in steady sailing.  He gives golden emphasis to strings,by preventing brasses from abrasiveness, he builds the majestic cathedral with spacious faith. Seventh is perfect, but the Fourth is gorgeous.
PORTUGUES: Eu possuo integrais de Bruckner sob Karajan, Furtwangler,Wand, Tintner e Jochum, alm de algumas sinfonias  com Celibidache, Baremboim,Solti.. Eu me havia prometido nao mais comprar Bruckner pois eu pensava ser impossvel trazer um novo senso de interpretao bruckneriana. Eu estava errado.  Thielemann estremeceu minha mente,alma e corpo. Sou chegado a andamentos mais lentos,desde que nao caiam em pulsao inorgnica, como fez Celi na Oitava.
 Bem, temos aqui 74 minutos na  4  e  73 min. na  7. Cerca de dez minutos a mais do que o usual.  O regente, contudo, consegue conservar sua nave em estvel navegao.
Ele d dourada nfase s cordas, previne os metais de abrasividade e constroi a majestosa catedral com espaosa f. A Stima est perfeita, mas a Quarta, um esplendor.

8569814,5,B00BK5JPFU,"Conductor Christian Thielemann is best known for his magnificent series of Beethoven's immortal nine symphonies, performed with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and here we are offered his work of a few years earlier with the Munich Philharmonic performing two Bruckner symphonies. In the mid to late 1800s, Anton Bruckner created one massive symphony after another, with the two examples on this disc each being in excess of 70 minutes. He ultimately produced a total of eleven, but regarding his first two as ""student"" symphonies, he numbered only the last nine. Although acknowledged to be one of the world's finest organists, Bruckner struggled to be recognized for his ability as a composer. Socially awkward, he was out of place in Vienna, the sophisticated Imperial capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But Bruckner's symphonies have survived and grown in reputation, and this edition of his two most popular symphonies, the Fourth and the Seventh, will help to spread his belated success to new generations.

The performance of these two symphonies by the Munich Philharmonic is delightful, with great sound befitting a Cmajor Blu-ray production from Unitel Classica. It features conductor Christian Thielemann in two relatively early recordings from 2007 and 2009, made before his very successful Beethoven cycle. The video is very slightly less sharp than Thielemann's subsequent Beethoven and Brahms Blu-rays, but still sufficiently detailed to notice small things such as the wandering left eye of the concertmaster, a small spot bandage on the back of a horn player's hand, and the American Liberty-head dimes soldered to the keys of a French horn.

The acerbic composer Igor Stravinsky said that it was very difficult to write the same symphony twice, but that Bruckner had done it nine times. Bruckner's music is distinctive, his style recognizable. The two symphonies featured on this Blu-ray are typical in many ways, with wonderfully bombastic passages for massed brass contrasted with lyrical strings and woodwinds. First performed in 1881, Bruckner called his Fourth Symphony the ""Romantic"", a designation that puzzles some observers. Asked the meaning of the title, Bruckner responded with an allusion to medieval knights on horseback emerging from a castle gate at sunrise. Whether this was a serious explanation or a satire remains an open question.

Bruckner's fame rests in part on his compulsive revision of his symphonies, some of which exist in three or four versions. The exception to this mania was the Seventh Symphony. Aside from the unfinished Ninth, the Seventh is the only one of his symphonies that he never revised. The Seventh was Bruckner's greatest success, and the only one to achieve international recognition in his lifetime. It was first performed in 1884, and in 1886 was performed in several major cities of Germany as well as in Chicago, New York, and Amsterdam.

This disc is a great introduction to Bruckner's music, featuring as it does his two deservedly most popular works.",1397520000,3,3030,5.293139293139293
8569815,5,B00BK5JPFU,"In the accompanying essay, The Art of Controlled Ecstasy, the author confidently proclaims that Thielemann, more so than any other conductor on the current scene is the ideal exponent of the Germanic Bruckner tradition of performance. Whether or not one subscribes to this notion, there is no denying the excellence of this release. Thielemann does an admirable job with these two popular works. He is particularly sensitive to the perpetual ebb and flow of Bruckners syntax and sprawling architecture. The pacing, albeit somewhat deliberate is very effective. Its remarkable how Thielemanns Spartan podium presence elicits such intensity and concentration on the part of his players. The videography is finely etched and deft in its composition and editing. The sound pickup is rich and three dimensional. Observing this conductor and great orchestra only heightens the transcendent quality of the aural experience. Even those never convinced by this music may find themselves reconsidering.",1383696000,8,992,5.576158940397351
8569816,5,B00BK5JPFU,"For those music lovers who are at best lukewarm about Bruckner, this live performance of his 4 th and  7 th symphonies by the Munich Philharmonic  under the baton of Thielemann may yet change hearts. Mention Bruckner's Romantic symphony and the Munich PO and invariably the discussion will turn to the late Sergiu Celibidache and his enthralling live recording on EMI in 1993. It has a lot of admirers and justifiably so, although I still think his finale overly long. For me the top choice remains Gunter Wand's  incandescent 1998 recording on BMG /RCA.
The Munich sound on this disc is really top notch and gives nothing away to their more exalted brethren in Berlin. Under Thielemann, this 1880/1881 version of the Romantic is arguably one of the best modern recording, artistically, and without argument the best recorded audio. The strings sound sweet and the brasses and wood winds simply scrumptious! Video following of the score is meticulous and spot on. Thielemann succeeds in bringing out the rustic and medieval elements of the symphony in a reading that is quite often charming but always thrilling. One is reminded of heroes like Siegfried, of castles and knights and troubadours and huntsmen in woodlands but above everything else, an all encompassing feeling of joy, a celebration of existence in a romanticised earthly paradise, albeit Germanic! Just listen to the exultant finale.
The 7th symphony is darker and more profound. No programme here, just music and emotion on an higher plane.
The first movement opens with a soaring phrase from violins and cellos and the first motif comes from his Mass in D minor. For the most part the music is calm and melodious interrupted now and again by fierce blazes of brass. Exciting stuff. But it is really the second movement which ultimately decides whether a performance of this symphony flourishes or perishes. Here Thielemann triumphs. Here Bruckner wrote an Adagio that is perhaps the most exalted movement in all of classical music, and Thielemann brings it off beautifully. A dirge in its very nature and composed as an elegy for the  death of Bruckner's idol Wagner, this passage is truly sublime. Beginning mournfully and solemnly, with lower strings and augmented brass including 4 Wagnerian tubas, the movement picks up in feeling and tension as the theme is stated and restated, and pushes onwards slowly but surely towards the inevitable climax and lo and behold, Thielemann caps it with a great clash of cymbals! Now Bruckner buffs will either nod in agreement or shake their heads depending on their view of the authenticity of this addition. Bruckner gave way to the famous conductor Nikisch who more or less demanded the cymbal clash, but does it really make that much of a difference ? Here Thielemann releases the tension admirably with its use, but the great Gunter Wand built up tension and released it without  this brash clash and for many, myself included, his searing performance of the Adagio is without equal !
Then follows a striking scherzo and a trio, delightfully played, as the third movement. The feisty fourth movement repeats motifs from the previous three, sometimes fast, sometimes agitated, before at last pitching headlong into a furious and ebullient finale. What a way to finish !
Only the future will tell whether this Bruckner disc of Thielemann will stand the test of time and become a benchmark of these symphonies for this decade.  I have a very strong feeling it will !",1382745600,7,3476,4.974182444061962
