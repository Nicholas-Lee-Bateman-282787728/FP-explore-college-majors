6164136,1,B00HHO8WRK,"As the lyrics go, suicide may be ""painless"", but 5 minutes into this movie and you'll wish you were dead! No, really, none of it makes any sense, the timing is all wrong, there's very little of that ""Red Sky"" thing happening, and it just can't get any slower or uninteresting! Stupid stupid stupid. Even Goose with his ""do some of that pilot shit, Mav"" couldn't have rescued this movie! Other than that my popcorn was amazing!",1403827200,4,426,4.545454545454546
6164137,2,B00HHO8WRK,"Four Naval air Pilots are given rogue orders from  Mario Van Peebles to destroy a specific site inside Iraq. As it turns out they kill an American. In an bad plot point, the pilots are forced to resign. Their target, ""Rainmaker"" was a WMD owned by Iraq, and is now in the hands of the Kurds. The film isn't much into mystery or twists. Butch (Cam Gigandet) is eventually recruited by the prosecutor (Bill Pullman) and Double agent Van Peebles to destroy the WMD, now in Iran and in the hand of the Kurds who intend to use it against Iran's oil field. Tom Craig (Shane West) also a pilot who got drummed out of the service,  works on the dark side and left his girl friend ( Rachael Leigh Cook) to Butch.

The film didn't require much thinking. Rachael Leigh Cook is in Russia one minute,  Nevada the next, and then back to Russia. The character build up was weak. The plot needed polish and some suspense . The actors were as convincing in their roles as were the CG effects. The film does have some ""Top Gun"" type action in it, but Cam  Gigandet is no Tom Cruise.

Okay as a Redbox, 50 cents off second rental.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. 1 love scene with back nudity. Men in ""crack"" underwear. Scantily clad ladies dancing on tables. Mariya Guzeeva bra/panties.",1397433600,6,1265,4.426724137931035

6164149,3,B00HHO8WRK,The movie was good but would have been better if the law suits and other issues did not strip this movie of a lot of great flying footage. The best parts of this movie are laying on someone's desk.,1408579200,2,197,4.076923076923077

I did like the one or two CGI fighter jet flight interactions....other than that, it was all horrible.  I turned it off 3/4 into the movie.  Is there a way to get a refund for movies?",1407801600,4,393,4.507042253521127

8632808,3,B00HHO8WRK,"Not a bad movie. I liked it. The only Hornet piloting is the very beginning. Then after that they go on a journey, get screwed over and make a jail break and then fly some SU-27s and have some AA engagements and it's over.  But it does have a bit of a cool story line.
Some good flying scenes.",1466812800,,293,3.9661016949152543

8632814,2,B00HHO8WRK,"I gave it 2 stars because it has 2 of my favorite actors in it, Cam Gigandet and Shane West. I give my guys credit, they tried to breathe some life into this lackluster movie. They did fairly well considering what they had to work with. ""A film by Mario Van Peebles"", I should have known and shame on me. The supporting actors....appalling, the dialog is mundane and the story and direction is contrived. I gave up (finally) an hour into it, I'm not that masochistic that I would put myself through it. I beg you not to even give this a shot......you have been warned.",1430092800,,568,4.367924528301887
