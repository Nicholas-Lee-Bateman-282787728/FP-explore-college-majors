1789765,5,B00006RJLT,Just saw it in the movie theatre and it was amazing. Great job of building classic horror tone.,1515888000,2,95,4.333333333333333
1789766,5,B00006RJLT,"Great horror film that kept me on the edge of my seat. Great actors and content, I would definitely recommend seeing this.",1515888000,2,122,4.590909090909091

1789768,5,B00006RJLT,A small gem of a horror movie. A classic demonic possession story in a small Illinois town. It's based on true events. The lead actress was on How I Met Your Mother. All the actors are excellent. The special effects are pretty cool too. There are a lot of really creepy moments and a few jump scares. I really enjoyed it from start to finish.,1515801600,3,342,4.276923076923077
1789769,1,B00006RJLT,Not very good or scary... Emmanuelle vaugier in Small bit role was the highlight of the film,1494892800,2,92,4.470588235294118
1789850,4,B00006RJLT,"A Demon Within is exactly the movie you are looking for if you are looking for a mindless, conventional, late-night horror. The characters are your typical horror movie types, and the actors are able to aptly portray terror. There are a few notably creepy scenes and some amusing, campy moments. Go in with measured expectations, there is definitely some joy to be had watching A Demon Within. I would recommend this movie to your die-hard horror types and those not bothered by the overuse of the possession storyline in horror films.",1518393600,,535,4.8901098901098905
1789851,4,B00006RJLT,"Id been wanting to see A Demon Within ever since Id first heard of it, but I didn't get the chance to finally watch until last night. And let me tell you! It took me a solid two hours to fall asleep because I just had that visual of the cop being attacked in the basement running through my mind on repeat. Horror movies these days rarely live up to the title, but A Demon Within totally brought me back to what I love about the genre in the first place. Amazing!",1518048000,,463,4.043478260869565
1789852,4,B00006RJLT,"Good horror movies are hard to come by, thanks to the limited production value necessary to make a good one and the market saturation in regards to films within the genre.  Hence, when a horror film of genuine quality comes out, its a big deal.  A Demon Within is a film that firmly resides in this tier of movie.  The story depicts a battle between new residents in a suburb, aided by the residential priest and a troubled doctor, with the eponymous being.  Ayush Banker and Justin LaReaus collaborative directorial efforts, coupled with Dan Wangs pristine cinematography, make for an experience highlighted by eerie visuals and placelessness, helped doubtlessly by the fact that the fictional small-town setting of the film puts it squarely within the realm of relatability for so many demographics of people.  The score is simultaneously haunting and beautiful, leaning on the latter characteristic when the film develops the characters relationships and the former when things become more supernatural.  Its not the most original story, but sometimes making a strong product means sticking with what you're comfortable with.  The terrors and heart in this film show where Banker and LaReaus strengths  and hopefully, the direction of their future endeavors  lie.",1517875200,,1266,5.227722772277228
1789853,4,B00006RJLT,"Independent movies have a potential for every filmmaker. They are full of creativity, originality, and often an inspiration for every one of us who dream of making movies. A Demon Within brings the best out of the indie horror genre, with an impressive direction from Justin LaReau, who is experienced making this kind of movies. The whole cast also does remarkable work, but it is Charlene Amoia the one I enjoyed the most. Overall a terrific cast and creative team, a combination that makes this movie even more enjoyable than it looks.",1517875200,,538,4.858695652173913
1789854,4,B00006RJLT,A Demon Within was a petrifying take on a new age possession movie. This film reminded me of Insidious and The Conjuring because of their similar ending that made you want more. A Demon Within was surprisingly action packed and Patricia Ashley as Charlotte gave a bloodcurdling performance. Im glad that I didn't miss out on watching this movie. I suggest you should watch it if you love scary movies!!,1517788800,,402,4.757142857142857
1789855,1,B00006RJLT,Absolutely terrible! This was more of a comedy movie for my family than a horror. I honestly cannot understand how there are 5 star reviews for this.,1517529600,2,149,4.555555555555555
1789856,1,B00006RJLT,Hate it enough to bother writing about how much I hate it. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Please trust me and rent something else.,1516924800,,134,4.869565217391305
1789857,1,B00006RJLT,This was an extremely slow and corny movie. By far one of the worst I've seen with VERY cliche and dry acting. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star but its the lowest it would let me give. Save your money and watch something better maybe like paint drying or grass growing.,1516924800,,268,4.2745098039215685
1789858,1,B00006RJLT,Bad.  Waist of money.,1516838400,,21,4.25
1789859,1,B00006RJLT,"trust the one star reviews because they are being generous.if you rate this as five stars,then you're getting paid for a good review.i wasted another $4.99 because of fake reviews.i've seen better movies on syfy!",1516752000,,212,5.085714285714285

1789925,1,B00006RJLT,This was worse than a lifetime movie and at certiain parts I thought I was watching an infomercial for religion. Parts that were supposed to be scary fell flat at best and made me laugh at worst.,1516492800,4,195,4.297297297297297
1789926,3,B00006RJLT,"First off not a real big fan of exorcist kinda horror but I thought I would give it a shot from all the decent reviews. It's one of them movies you would watch late at night when there was just nothing else on but infomercials. The acting was ok but the story bored me, jump scares weak not even a goose bump ending stupid. 3 star cause I like the priest's acting, wait till it comes out on prime to watch.",1516320000,,406,4.0246913580246915
1789927,3,B00006RJLT,Was ok but predictable. This should be on Prime..,1516320000,3,49,4.555555555555555
1789928,1,B00006RJLT,Thinly veiled religious propaganda for really stupid people. The acting ranges from wooden to absurd. Save yourself the money and pain. This review is based on the first half of the movie. I just couldn't watch more.,1516233600,4,216,4.864864864864865
1789929,5,B00006RJLT,"Loved it! Definitely not disappointing, kept me curious until the end, not predictable, surprise ending, great acting",1516147200,,117,5.9411764705882355

1789933,5,B00006RJLT,Watched the film in the theatre and needed to own it. Film really does an amazing job carrying the classic horror feeling throughout the movie. The emotion has great contrasting moments with many subtle story points foreshadow future events. Glad I own it and will watch again. Wish there were more films like this available.,1515888000,2,325,4.927272727272728

7972756,3,B00006RJLT,Very boring and slow.  Very little story and action.  Watching Freddy Kruger is better.  Sorry but I call them as I see them..,1525219200,,126,4.391304347826087

7972759,5,B00006RJLT,"A little slow out of the gate, but the film gets moving rather quickly and has several surprises at the end! There's a decent story depth which I wasn't expecting and the acting is good. Numerous jump scares? Of course!

No real gore or sex scenes, so I could easily recommend this as a date flick - IF your date likes scary/horror movies! Probably best for 16 and over, though. Nice to see something different from all the ""comic-book"" movies that have flooded the market lately.",1522195200,,480,4.5813953488372094

7972761,1,B00006RJLT,"In the year 1914, a demon enters the body of a young girl. Fast forward to the 21st century. New owners of the house have a young daughter who is the perfect victim for possession. Priest tries to convince the town doctor, then the girl's mother. Of course, neither believe him. Same ole poorly acted plotting, topped of by scenes that didn't scare me. By now, you should know that this movie should be avoided.",1521331200,,411,4.493333333333333
