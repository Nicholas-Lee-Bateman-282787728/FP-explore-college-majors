8076798,1,B000AA4GJQ,"By far this was the WORST documentary I have ever seen. Full of psycho babble, constantly blaming his parents (especially his mother) for all of his idiosyncrasies; random movie clips that suggested actual life events, but short of actual correct footage; poor quality video; and what was with all of the historical information about that suspension bridge in Bristol?

I LOVE Cary Grant. I watched this DVD as soon as it arrived. What a horrible disappointment and a waste of money. The makers should be embarrassed to have produced such sloppy garbage.",1471305600,,554,5.021739130434782
8076799,1,B000AA4GJQ,"I adore many of Cary Grant's films - but the two included on this disc are not among them. ""Penny Serenade"" is a poorly (over)acted, unbelievable and maudlin film. ""His Girl Friday"" has moments - and it's pretty funny but... the documentary was the reason I rented this and it was dismal. It was basically a poorly written narration of a slide show - if I hear ""overbearing mother"" one more time - I swear I'll ... it's just not presented in an interesting way though the narrator swore at the beginning that it was... he didn't convince me. Yawn.",1316563200,4,547,4.48
8076800,2,B000AA4GJQ,"The main thing about the biography is that they accompany Grant's quite sad life story with completely inappropriate cheery rinky-tink piano music, including, believe it or not, ""The Entertainer""!  Between this jarring music, the narration, and the music and dialogue from the film clips, you sometimes can't quite hear the narration.  Surprisingly bad presentation.",1160352000,6,366,5.7592592592592595
