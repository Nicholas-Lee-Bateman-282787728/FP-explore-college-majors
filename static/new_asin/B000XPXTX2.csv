8229192,5,B000XPXTX2,"I think this independent film is brilliant in many ways -- writing, directing, acting, etc... Indy film cult hero James Vculek certainly isn't a one-trick pony. Two Harbors was equally brilliant even though the two films have such different vibes and videographic methods. We've been waiting too long for the next offering from Vculek.",1466553600,,335,5.222222222222222
8229193,3,B000XPXTX2,"I purchased this movie after seeing on PBS (and then buying) another movie written and directed by James Vculek and starring Catherine Johnson called ""Two Harbors."" In that movie, Johnson played a damaged, vulnerable young woman named Cassie who works at a flea market and falls in love with a fellow dealer obsessed with making contact with extraterrestrials named Vic (played by Alex Cole, who's a cross between Al Franken and Jack Nicholson). The black-and-white film was shot for only $10,000 and yet, despite its low budget, was unforgettable because of the lead actors and the unusual story. It's not really about aliens, however. It's really about obsession and how it can harm both those we care about and ourselves.

In The Quietest Sound, Johnson once again expertly plays another damaged woman, this time a frantic and emotionally drained single mother named Elizabeth whose four year old daughter, Chloe, is missing. The movie is shot entirely in one take of two cops (Michael Tezla and Chris Carlson)questioning her in an interrogation room. As Elizabeth is submitted to yet another round of questioning, she keeps changing the details of her story (such as what her daughter was wearing the morning she disappeared at the Walmart and whether or not there really was a ""creepy man"" shadowing them)and the cops grow suspicious of her. Elizabeth also may have abused her son, Michael. The officers (who we never fully see) do the good cop, bad cop routine to get a confession out of her. Once we think we've found out what really happened to Chloe, Vculek pulls the rug out from under us and makes us question everything we've just seen. Like Two Harbors, this film is bleak with dark twists and doesn't have a Hollywood happily ever after ending. All three actors do solid work, but Johnson is amazing as Elizabeth. It's painful to watch her emotionally unravel before her interrogators. This actress deserves to start getting parts in bigger films. She is the heart of both Two Harbors and The Quietest Sound.",1206835200,,2022,4.929618768328446
8229194,5,B000XPXTX2,"When a friend suggested we see ""The Quietest Sound"" at the Connecticut Film Festival, then mentioned in passing that it was a feature film shot in one long take, I reluctantly agreed, figuring I was in for a challenging experience in arty experimental cinema. What I got instead was one of the most emotionally wrenching and intricately plotted films I've ever seen. And it really is one 75 minute shot, but it works perfectly. To say more would give it all away. But if the film was really made for under 50 dollars, as the filmmaker claims, it's got to be the biggest ""bang for the buck"" in cinema history. To mention only one aspect of this amazing film: the performance by Catherine Johnson is unbelievable. She single-handedly carries the film, the camera never leaving her face for 75 minutes. I'd like to see any of the current crop of young Hollywood actresses pull that off.  See this film if it screens at a festival near you. You won't be disappointed.",1204329600,,963,4.631578947368421
