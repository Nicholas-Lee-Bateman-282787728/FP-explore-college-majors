6938041,3,B00RZXWVLQ,"The writers/director started out beautifully and sailed through with with the wind at their backs up to the point when ""Jonah"" rises from the grave and murders the whole group of kids, with the exception of the one young woman who is a devout Catholic.

I had issues with so much time being devoted to the parents who are throwing their own party upstairs while the kids are up to no good in the basement. I understand the ""adult"" party scenes are a form of comic relief, but somehow they missed the mark on that one; the device is not employed properly and the parents antics detract from the core plot as an annoyance rather than what was originally intended.

OK, here I have to edit the review and after watching this a second time, I had one of those ""Uh Duh"" moments and realized that the ""Jonah"" creature is actually one of the parents 2nd husband whom she murdered for his money.
So, major gap in logic; why isn't ""Jonah"" going after the ex wife instead of targeting the kids first?

Unfortunately, once ""Jonah"" makes his appearance the entire film disintegrates into an amateurish stereotypical B horror film and destroys all the credibility of what came before.

It's apparent that there are strong religious overtones in this plot and a message of caution and warning; which I don't necessarily have an issue with, but it is extremely difficult to strike the delicate balance between maintaining professionalism and incorporating strong religious views; the failure to do so results in a film which simply comes off as mere proselytizing on a soap box, which I'm afraid happened here.",1430352000,3,1595,4.747292418772563
6938042,4,B00RZXWVLQ,"A modern throwback that gets most of the cues right. Loads of fun in a EC Comics, Tales from the Crypt kind of way. With chills and thrills, practical gore effects, and a cool retro synth score that rocks! Give it a spin, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1430265600,,263,4.28
6938043,1,B00RZXWVLQ,"This movie SUCKS!!! I forced myself to watch it since I paid for it...the acting is terrible, I almost thought it was a spoof but it is not, the acting is just that bad! Definitely in the top 5 of the worst movies I've ever seen, no joke! You'll be much happier if you pass this one up!",1430265600,2,286,3.9482758620689653
6938044,1,B00RZXWVLQ,"OMG, the mental cases that left positive reviews must be part of the cast because this was the worse movie I've ever seen.  It's worse than most of the movies they give you as a prime member.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  The actors must have been paid in food stamps.  The absolute worse. The only reason I gave it one star is because I was forced to rate it.",1430179200,6,365,4.027777777777778
6938045,5,B00RZXWVLQ,"Yes it is low budget and populated by dumb stock characters. At times feels like a remake since it's all been done before, but it is so much fun. I do love slashers :-)

Extra star for having Scream Queen Brinke Stevens in it.",1429920000,2,226,4.136363636363637

Excited and happy about the film being picked up for distribution. Thank you for the support!",1429574400,4,257,5.0
8696674,2,B00RZXWVLQ,"""The Ouija Possession"" and ""Jonah Lives"" are the same film. A group of bored kids playing games in the basement while adults are upstairs having a wild party. They end up raising Jonah from the dead, who was killed by his wife who was apparently Brinke Stevens the lone bright spot of the film and someone with a great agent. Now rather than avenge his death, he decides he must kill all the kids, and none too soon. Unfortunately it dragged out. The kids couldn't act. They had lousy lines. Jonah had irritating swagger music and looked like a rental costume. The horror effects bordered on cheesy.

When you re-release a film under a new title, general rule of thumb is that is was lousy. This was filmed in Fall River, Mass. and I believe the large looming cooling towers in the background at the end, are those of Brayton Point Power Station, a coal-fire plant.

The description is incorrect. The ""wicked cool"" Ouija board was not in the basement but upstairs and brought to the basement. Note the picture of Edgar Allan Poe on the wall in the upstairs living room. Why? I don't know.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Film has some sacrilegious moments.",1482969600,,1158,4.584541062801932

8696677,3,B00RZXWVLQ,"Indie horror movie about a group of teens who accidentally bring someone back from the dead while using a Ouija board is definitely not a good movie but it's sometimes interesting or entertaining anyway, which makes Jonah Lives a better watch than many indie horror films.  At one early point one of the characters tells his baby sister to read The Bible (her reaction of 'What kind of book is that?' suggests that she never heard of the thing before) because it will teach her everything she needs to know about the world.  At this point a disappointed viewer might expect Jonah Lives to be a Christian horror film but writer/director Luis Carvalho turns out to be nothing if not inconsistent.  When this same character brings a Ouija board down to the basement where his friends are he wants to use the board with all 6 of them because that's the number of the beast and will give them the ability to tap into ultimate power--which doesn't really sound very Christian.

One of the friends won't participate because, apparently, Ouija boards are harmless when used by two people but genuinely dangerous when used by larger numbers--who knew?  The rest of the friends contact a spirit named Jonah and then decide to try and bring him back from the dead, which unfortunately for them actually works.  Jonah is apparently not happy about being brought back and comes around to try and kill everyone in the basement.  Since the irresponsible adults upstairs are having a loud party (complete with drugs and the bowl full of keys thing) they don't hear anything as their children are gruesomely slaughtered by the zombie just one floor below.

There is a twist regarding the spirit that opens up a giant plot hole--why is Jonah wasting his resurrection going after the teens that brought him back when there are more deserving targets?  Bringing Jonah back from the dead inspires an existential crisis in one of the girls who realizes there is no God and that everything they have ever been taught is a lie--unfortunately she doesn't deal with that epiphany well.

There are 10-15 minutes near the end when Jonah Lives completely shifts gears stylistically and the music, editing and camera work suddenly transform the movie into a homage of Italian horror movies by Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento.  That part of Jonah Lives works so well it's a genuine shame writer/director Luis Carvalho didn't use that approach for the entire film.

Jonah Lives gets points for being more ambitious than your typical low budget schlock and also for screwing with audience expectations pretty effectively--but it's still very uneven at best so horror fans should go into this one with extremely low expectations.  Filmmaker Luis Carvalho shows promise and might make a better movie next time if he gets the opportunity.  I guess you can file this one under either 'nice try' or 'could have been much worse'.",1434844800,2,2888,4.855397148676171

8696679,1,B00RZXWVLQ,"I am a horror movie junkie and I love them all - good, bad, campy, etc. but this one was atrocious in every aspect. Repugnant acting, amateur cinematography, dollar store sound effects, repetitive and annoying dialog, and a script that simply belongs in the toilet. I love my fair share of bad horror flicks, I'm no snob, but the only reason I suffered through the entire 90 minutes of this film was because I paid for it, it was that bad.
