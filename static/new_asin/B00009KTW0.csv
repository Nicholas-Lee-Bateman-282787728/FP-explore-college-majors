I was looking to get started, but of course I was looking for the quick way.  However, when I decided to slow down, I found this DVD gave the best instruction on how to start playing rhythms right off the back and how to coordinate your arms and legs.  It doesn't do a whole lot for learning to read the music but you can get other books or DVD's for that (which is what I have done).  I have found that with any instrument whether it is piano, drums, snare, guitar, etc., you need to start slow just 30 minutes a day will give you great results and keep you sane so that when you get to the good parts you will be able to do them effortlessly. That's when it all pays off. Also, expect for it to take time, like years to become great at playing near the professional level.",1446681600,2,881,4.069364161849711
