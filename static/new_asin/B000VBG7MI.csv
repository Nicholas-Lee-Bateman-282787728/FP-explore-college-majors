Even with that marvelous Howard Keel with his superior singing voice and superior good looks, this is Dale Robertson's movie all the way animated or not.  It was a total surprise to me for such a good ""cowboy"" actor to sponsor a children's feature.  It was a bit before my time so, if it was shown in theaters, somehow I missed it.  I think I viewed every cowboy movie worth watching, and my favorites on t.v.

8217967,5,B000VBG7MI,"This is a really rare animated western story set in the late 1800's, with a historic group of actors for the voices . It features the voice talents of cowboy star Dale Robertson in the lead as rancher Justin Eagle;  Howard Keel who sings the really nice title song; Barbara Jen Wong as voice of Stormy;  Other voice actors include singing and ukulele star Cliff Edwards (also the voice of Disney's Jiminy Cricket); Herschel Bernardi (also known for Charlie the Tuna voice) and Pinto Colvig who had a huge voice career, including 10 years as Bozo; at Disney he voiced Goofy,  Practical Pig, Pluto, Sleepy and Grumpy;  Gabby and Bluto for Fleischer Studios; and a munchkin in the Wizard of Oz. He was also a animator and a writer. Ross Martin plays the voice of Andy, as well as the Senator. Edgar Buchanan stars as Sorry.
In the story, a rancher lives on a ranch called ""the Eagles Nest"". He goes by the name of Justin Eagle and goes undercover to investigate the kidnapping of a US Senator as part of a larger land grab scheme. The senator was investigating an issue involving the railroads expanse into the West, and how some shady characters are exploiting situation by buying the land in advance of the railroad buying it and jacking up the price. Eagle has an adopted Japanese daughter named Stormy, and a sidekick named Sorry. We get a lot of scenes of his home life with the animals including horses, dog, a skunk, and a carrier pigeon, and even a tussle with a mountain lion. There are a few songs. The music for the title song was written by George Bruns, a studio composer at Disney although they are not involved . Rare but fun western, great for the kids.",1266969600,5,1666,4.524916943521594
