8398754,1,B000HBL2MW,This DVD says DVD-R format.  I should be able to read this on a computer.  I tried 3 different DVD units and one laptop based DVD and was not able to read it on any.  One of them could pick up the sound but no picture.  So I think they have a bad batch.  I would rather review the content and not the production of the DVD.  I was able to find the program to view on the Web.,1160870400,3,375,3.6835443037974684
