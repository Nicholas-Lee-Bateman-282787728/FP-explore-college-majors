8380226,5,B002TIU4YI,"As a long time supporter of Smile Train I recommend this DVD with no reservations, these children, in the poorest countries in the world face death or complete and total social isolation and misery with this disfigurement that is easily repaired. In the US any child regardless of income will have this repair done in the first months of life, but for children not as fortunate the surgical repair is only a dream since their families make pennies per day. But then there are angels, the Doctors, the Nurses, the Social Workers, the Volunteers, and the children themselves....next time you think about spending $250 on a designer handbag or something similar think about saving a child's life for 250.00 as Warren Buffet said 'that is a pretty good investment.' God Bless the Angels!!",1347667200,3,784,4.902255639097745
8380227,5,B002TIU4YI,"Cleft and other palate and mouth deformations are stigmas and people do not want to talk about them. For this reason they are still without a clear cause and prevention method. This little documentary explains the activity of an NGO, SMILETRAIN. In 70 countries, they try to find out where are the children with cleft and other mouth deformations, in order to practice a simple operation which will save their lives and help them out of superstition and emargination. Very beautiful and moving, oscar winning piece of movie.",1270166400,2,524,4.965909090909091
