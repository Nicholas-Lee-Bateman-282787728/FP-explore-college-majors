1. From the description, ""In this program you will ride in the front left seat from Canal Street to the end of the line at Claiborne Ave. The operation of the controls is clearly visible in the video.""  This is true.  However, because of the huge difference between the dim light inside the streetcar and the very bright light outside, the view outside is way over-exposed and thus washed out.  So you get to see the engineer move the controls for maybe a half hour but you can't make out much detail about the areas the streetcar is moving through.  And even if the exposure was correct you couldn't see much because the videographer did not choose to use the ultra wide-angle lens that would have given us much more of a view through the side window as well as the front.  So this part gets very boring very quickly.

2.  From the description, ""You will then ride back with our camera mounted on the side of the streetcar for an unusual view of the trip.""  Without the ultra wide-angle lens, the side of the streetcar occupies almost half the frame and again, we don't get to see much of the surroundings.  The side of the streetcar gets very boring very quickly.

Scattered through the video are some very good sequences taken with the videocamera outside and stationary, panning the streetcar as it moves by.  This is the traditional way to shoot moving trains and this DVD is an excellent example of why it's not a good idea to ignore traditon.

There are also a few good sequences of a sternwheeler from the New Orleans waterfront, and traditional sequences of the modern Riverfront streetcars.

If you want a good DVD of streetcars, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pacific-Electric-Los-Angeles-Streetcars-Combo-DVD/dp/B000OIZF4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pacific Electric Los Angeles Streetcars Combo DVD</a>.",1350604800,,2094,5.1875
