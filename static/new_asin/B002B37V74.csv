3892782,4,B002B37V74,It is easy to follow and of the same style as the NIA classes I take.  I wish there were more DVDs available.,1378771200,,109,3.739130434782609
3892783,5,B002B37V74,"This is the greatest exercise routine. I've done Yoga, Tai Chi, aerobics. Nia is not like exercising at all. It's more like dancing & that's why I love it so much! I enjoy the teachers, the moves & the music is great. Love everything about it. It is so fun! It just takes some practice to learn the different moves but it's so fun doing it. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!",1371513600,,365,4.382352941176471

3892785,4,B002B37V74,I am really enjoying this Dvd.  The instructions are great and I really like how you can pick and choose from the menu what you want to do.  If you don't have time to complete the whole dvd you can choose a shorter workout.  No matter what you do it is such an enjoyable experience.,1356220800,,282,4.090909090909091
3892786,3,B002B37V74,"The workout is pretty good, if you can get past the guy in red tights, Carlos.  He's really creepy.  I'm going to have to watch this with the sound off.  Can't stand his voice and all the subliminal messages.  Too many words.",1351728000,4,225,4.285714285714286
3892787,5,B002B37V74,I am not the dance person; so I didn't know what to expect from this DVD but thought I would give it a try.  I absolutely love the way it aligns my body; this surprised me because I have been practicing & teaching yoga for more than 40 yrs and seldom has my practice made me feel this alive.  I now do NIA every morning and it makes my day brighter.,1308182400,15,349,3.9014084507042255
3892788,5,B002B37V74,"Nia first came across my radar from the DVD Soul Sweat, as Chantal is a certified Nia instructor who wove lots of Nia technique into Soul Sweat. But since there is only one Soul Sweat DVD and I've been dancing to it for 2 years(!) I thought I'd go to the source and see what it was about from its creators. I bought Global Unity as it has the 1 hour tutorial portion, but honestly, I haven't even looked at that part (part 2) of the DVD. I've just done the experiential Dance part of the DVD. It is 55 minutes, 10 minutes longer than Soul Sweat. I don't get quite the calorie burn I do with Soul Sweat and I like the World Beat of Soul Sweat's sound track better than Global Unity's soundtrack, but it's a wonderful DVD with many heart opening, joint opening, body wave movements that wake me up from toes to finger tips to the crown of my head and beyond. The steps are pretty simple to me after 2 years of Soul Sweat, which allows me to get out of my head around whether or not I am ""doing it right"" and into the pure joy of the movement.
I love what another commenter said about it reminding her of being a kid and dancing in front of a mirror. There is much child-like energy in this DVD, mostly coming from Carlos's leads. Debbie, on the other hand is a little more structured and dare I say ""parental"" in her instruction. They complement each other well and I love being able to see all the variety from the many people they have dancing behind them.
The DVD starts small and slow and builds to a rather ecstatic peak over the last two full song pieces, then comes back down to core, to breath, to expansion and contraction, to floor, to stretch.
The seller: carolargo was fast to ship. I got my DVD faster than buying directly from Amazon...I think I got it in 3 days from placing my order. Now I want more, so I'm logged on to Amazon to buy the next one.",1295136000,21,1862,4.175
3892789,4,B002B37V74,"Nia is a wonderful exercise. A mixture of dance and yoga and martial arts.  The music is varied and the nia is fun and about joy.  It is the sort of movement you wish you had continued from those early childhood playtimes when you were a famous dancer in front of a mirror.  Had i not done some classes i think I might have preferred part II as part I as it explains the method and reasoning behind the moves.  It is however, basically a free ""no wrong moves"" form of exercise. Like yoga, you are where you are and the more you practise the more flexible and fit you will become.",1260230400,24,579,4.142857142857143

8360629,5,B002B37V74,I love Nia and this DVD has two parts.  A great place to learn the 52 moves.,1502841600,,76,3.4705882352941178
8360630,5,B002B37V74,"Beautiful flow with nice rests and then increase of speed. Really love the fluidity of these movements.
Though it is far from being for beginners, unless you already have done some dancing or aerobics previously and have a good stamina to pursue this exiting new type of body movement.
The 1st time I could only do 10 minutes of exercise - which really means that i am totally out of shape.
I intend to consistently increase the time of the exercise until I get to complete it all and enjoy the full benefit.
This will give me an opportunity to grow and not being bored while doing it.",1482451200,,585,4.425925925925926

8360632,5,B002B37V74,"I am really enjoying this dvd.  It brings out the inner child in you - it's fun, and there are some improv sections which took me a couple times to really appreciate and get into.  But in the end, it's fairly structured and a good workout too.  It feels like I had a big hug when it's all over.  I highly recommend it!",1476144000,2,318,4.0
8360633,3,B002B37V74,"Interesting, but mostly to NIA aficiandos. If you'r'e new to NIA, there are better choices.",1462752000,,91,5.133333333333334
8360634,5,B002B37V74,"NIA is one of my absolute BEST discoveries in my quest for health, well being, peace of mind, sensuality, fitness thru dance and downright PLEASURE.  Everything I hear and see of NIA from Debbie and Carlos Rosas is pure joy, optimism and positivism - there is not one shred of negativity that I can feel when I'm moving to the joyful sounds and making the moves on the disc.  This one, Global Unity is particularly great in that there is a nearly 1-hour dance set, followed by their description of the NIA philosophy, then, followed by another near hour of practice demonstrations to help the dancer hone the skill.  If you are intent on focusing your mind to health, well-being, optimism and joy, do partake in Debbie and Carlos Rosas' NIA materials.",1457136000,2,751,4.674242424242424
8360635,5,B002B37V74,"Finally I can practice Nia at home, as there are no Nia classes in my town. This is a great addition having already taken Nia classes with an instructor - which I would highly recommend before just going it alone. You get a much deeper understanding.",1433721600,4,250,4.456521739130435
