Great chemistry between the two main characters and of course the rest of the characters as well.
I really like the music that accompanies the film as well.
Great storyline, acting and soundtrack!
I highly recommend it!",1373155200,2,309,4.7407407407407405

THIS is one of those movies that sneaks up on you with realistic acting.  Well written and well directed.  You can easily relate to the story.  Really enjoyed it.  This is what moviemaking is supposed to be like.  Stories, people.  Don't need 3-D special effects all the time.  Buy it now!",1370649600,,443,4.837837837837838
8577360,5,B00C4Y8J2Q,"'Whatever makes you happy' is the story of Anna and Alex, who are of different nature, living their different lifes in different social circles.
The drama is a brilliant character study, showing the fascination for each other as well as the inner conflicts, showing the development of emotions and decisions.
Also the convincing actors, good dialogues and unconventional ideas (I like the chatting scenes) make this excellent film worth seeing.
As this film is made on micro-budget, you can guess that this director has much more potential - I am curious for his next film.",1368921600,,573,5.042105263157895
