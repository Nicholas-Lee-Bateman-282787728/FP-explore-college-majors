8227680,5,B000XATUV2,"The stories in this DVD are very interesting and clever. They are told by truly native speakers of Italian, and having the subtitles in both languages really helps to learn Italian.

The animation moves slowly, not like today's modern cartoon films for children, so it may not capture your child's attention at a very young age (pre-school), but the stories are geared for a slightly older child, perhaps elementary age and up.

There is one other DVD by this company that is equally well done - Enchanting Christmas Stories - but beyond that, it's hard to find DVDs in Italian for children in the US. Definitely worth the purchase.",1332633600,,632,4.7889908256880735
8227681,4,B000XATUV2,"This is a brilliant idea.  I did not give five stars because the first one I received was on a faulty disc and had to be returned, but Amazon made it really easy and the second disc I received is fine.  I hope this company makes more of these DVDs in the future.",1268524800,,262,3.9245283018867925
8227682,5,B000XATUV2,"I first discovered Bookbox products while living in China and searching for high quality educational materials that would help my young daughter (then 4 years old) learn the language.  Their ""anibooks"" remain some of the best products I've found - daughter still loves to watch them after over two years now.  It is so helpful to be able to see subtitles in either language (in our case, English/Chinese)- sometimes I will turn off the sound entirely and ""read"" the English subtitles to my duaghter so she can learn the stories.  Most of the time, however, she is very happy to listen to the story in Mandarin and is gradually picking up the language along the way.  Beyond the excellent quality of the graphics and the audio (the Mandarin narrator is very clear and easy to understand), I love the multicultural, gentle nature of the stories themselves.  Even if you try to limit ""screen time"" as we do, you can feel good about the time your child spends reading/watching this dvd.  Finally, the dvds support a great cause - promoting literacy worldwide.",1222128000,,1055,4.801104972375691
8227683,5,B000XATUV2,"The stories are well-written and the graphics are creative. The stories are delightfully inventive, sensitive, and even thought provoking. But, most important, my children love the stories. My kids frequently ask to watch the DVD and share it with their friends who have become equally enamored. As an added bonus, with the assist from the simultaneous subtitling, the DVD appears to be reenforcing their reading skills.",1215648000,,420,5.378787878787879
8227684,5,B000XATUV2,"These stories are absolutely beautiful! If I could give more than 5 stars I would truly do so. The text, music, animation are done superbly. The DVD menus are elegant and easy to navigate. The characters felt so real I felt I could touch them on the screen. All narratives carry a very positive message, being very sensitive to culture.

More so, the stories appealed to both the child and the adult in me. I wish BookBox had existed when I was growing up -- it would been a blessing for someone who craved a deeper connection to other languages, other cultures, and to my own family.

Indeed, parents and children will find these stories are a wonderful way of connecting with each other. Educators will find the audio and subtitles in different languages help in reinforcing literacy and language. This is based on proven models as BookBox has evolved from a mass literacy project developed by Dr. Kothari.

And for those that feel $14.95 is expensive -- give it a chance. I had similar thoughts but after checking the DVDs I felt it was very fair as I was getting high quality. To me, this is the standard price for a DVD and worth it, considering I can keep and cherish for a long time.

A little background to put my words in context -- I am 27 years old and am fully trilingual, having grown up in India and Brazil. I have known BookBox since the beginning and believe in their mission of promoting literacy and culture in a fun way. I have donated time, energy and financial support to them and will be gifting these treasured DVDs to children in my life.",1214870400,,1562,4.470175438596491
8227685,3,B000XATUV2,I'd like to see the option to view the stories without the subtitles in english or spanish only after you've learned to read in every language.,1206316800,,143,4.538461538461538
