8474749,5,B005IHCRIS,"A mixture if history and work of art.  This DVD gives us a short history of tea, tea culture, and Chinese tea culture while at the same time being very pleasing to the eye.  The male eye.  LOTS of pretty women in this DVD.  I am pretty sure they used supermodels for this short. Interesting, beautiful, and just plain fun to watch.  And very detailed.  They talk NOT just about the history of tea, they explore the regions where the best tea comes from, the processing of tea, the many types of tea, how it has effected Chinese history, how tea is linked to the arts and scholars, as well as how tea is good for your body also.  They point out that tea is linked to nature and that there are many types of tea ceremonies.  It is used in celebrations and in international trade.  And this DVD is just so RELAXING to watch on its own!  Also I felt that the video, music, and images were all made FOR this short.  They feel like they fit together and were not just cut from other shows and features.  Very modern, very clean feel to the filming - not like some kind of homemade film or some used tape the teacher might put on when in Asian History class.
And did I mention the cute supermodels who seem to be everywhere, picking the tea, making the tea, and drinking the tea?  Not a complaint, just pointing that out.  Good job Bureau for External Cultural Relations, Ministry of Culture, P.R. China!  And when I say short I mean 30 minutes long, in color and stereo.  Something they may show on tour buses in China for all I know, between stops, but still good enough to enjoy in the living room.",1372896000,,1594,4.280936454849498
