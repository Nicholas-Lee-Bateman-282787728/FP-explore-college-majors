8639967,5,B00I8WB7BS,"Vastly underated!  I bought this for myself, than another copy for my grand-daughter!  We really enjoyed watching a few episodes together.  We've been told for years this was one of the worst series ever....as usual, I recommend making your own decision.  The critics are, well, critics....that's their job.  THIS IS A FUN, GREAT SERIES!  I think you'll enjoy it.  Vindicated after 50 years!  Dave, in Colorado",1432857600,8,410,5.106060606060606

8639969,4,B00I8WB7BS,"I have had this old show stuck in my brain for years. I can remember watching it as a child and although I had forgotten the individual episodes, I was always fascinated by the concept that one's mother could become a car! It was never explained what had happened to the mother or how she had become a car -- you just have to go on faith and accept that as the premise. Each episode is wonderfully predictable and totally 1960's in the approach to humor. The ""bad guys"" are clearly bad and the family is clearly good. How the wife doesn't get upset with a husband who cares more for an old car than his family is quite amazing.

Your serotonin levels will definitely increase while watching these old shows. They will make you laugh and entertain you fully. Is this high comedy or exceptional script-writing? Of course not. Just good fun.",1420070400,8,838,4.477124183006536
