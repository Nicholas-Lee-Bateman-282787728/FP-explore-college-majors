8301805,5,B001FB9L9E,"A great follow up DVD on Jang Bong Fundamentals.  The forms are broken down into manageable segments while showing the moves from different camera angles.  I typically learn one new form every 2-3 months with the limited time I have available to me.  This is a real investment into yourself , once you know a form you can practice it several times a week and so increase your physical fitness and self defense skills.",1473552000,,417,4.608108108108108
8301806,5,B001FB9L9E,"I was thrilled to start studying Jang Bong with Master Kim through this excellent dvd. He is one of the greatest TKD masters to learn from as he shares his authentic, perfection of this martial arts form. He provides very thorough explanations and demonstrations of each pattern and the rationale behind the moves that will produce the best results. It's the next best thing to studying with him in person which I miss greatly. But it was so good to see and hear him through this instructional dvd. I'm very happy to have purchased this.",1460678400,,537,4.663157894736842
