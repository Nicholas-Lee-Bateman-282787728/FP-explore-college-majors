Ma has a soothing and melodic voice, and although the subtitles aren't always comprehensible, she demonstrates every move, slowly and patiently, and you get it that way.  She combines breath work with manipulation of chi and accu-pressure.  All moves are slow, non-rigorous and low impact.  Ma is also active in life extension, extending lifespan.  I did all the exercises straight through and felt wonderful after.  The work-out covers the health of the ENTIRE body, is complete.  Very good!",1387756800,3,1326,6.230769230769231

I've done lots of chi gong and other asian exercises and health practices. This one WORKS FAST. My partner and I both noticed a huge increase in physical energy, stamina, and many health
benefits using this DVd just after a few days of use.. The presenter has been around the world teaching students this easy to do chi marrow cleaning program. She is famous in China.
However it always best to have an experienced teacher hopefully from asia with a couple of decaeds experience because you can raise your chi too quickly and create real problems for yourself that are not easily resolved.",1322092800,,769,4.703703703703703
