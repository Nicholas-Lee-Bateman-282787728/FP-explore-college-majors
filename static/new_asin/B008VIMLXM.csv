5185181,5,B008VIMLXM,"I purchased this for my dad, the man who has everything.  He loves Mel Brooks and was delighted to receive this brilliant collection.",1356566400,,133,4.782608695652174
5185182,3,B008VIMLXM,The first three CD's were very funny.  After that it was disappointing.  The last CD did not play and I had to return it.,1355875200,4,121,4.0
5185183,5,B008VIMLXM,"I chose this rating because I am, at 71, a lifelong utter and avid Mel Brooks fan. Whole swaths of ""Blazing Saddles"" are in my memory, and it was racially so foresighted in sending up our prejudices but in a way humorous enough to be educational.
So to hear him ruminate about his youthful takes/tapes is lovely, as is watching the formerly unavailable outtakes of films and early TV tapes I had no knowledge of. The 2000 Year Old Man introduced me to Brooks as a college freshman, and there was no turning back; especially as I began at a rather conservative college, his humor fortified my belief in myself as not insane because most exhortations to piety struck me as hilarious (at worst) and misguided (at best).",1355616000,7,716,4.6015625
5185184,5,B008VIMLXM,"1) For fans of Mel Brooks films buy the ridiculously low priced/high value Blu-Ray film box set on Amazon.
2) For fans of Mel the entertainer buy the set above AND this set.

I have been a fan since the mid 1990s, when I was introduced to his movies as a way to take a break from studying in college. Since then I watched and collected everything related to Mel that I could get my hands on. This set has things that I've never seen in my many years of collecting. A true rare gem of a collection beautifully assembled and presented for posterity. You will never find a production this amazing about Mel Brooks again, at least until Part 2 comes out... in 3D (just kidding)!

I think Shout! Factory has come up with an amazing template for future box sets.

PS - This review is super biased because 1) I'm a huge fan of Mel Brooks and 2) because they gave me, just a fan, a Shout! out for my little contribution to the set!",1355011200,,923,4.203389830508475
5185185,5,B008VIMLXM,"If you think Mel Brooks' movies are hysterical, wait til you see him as himself. I had the pleasure to see him speak at a screening of Blazing Saddles a year or so ago and it was then that I realized how sharp the man was and still is. That sparked my interest in a collection like this, and I was so tickled when I saw him promoting it on Jimmy Kimmel's late night show.

I purchased this DVD collection for my father and have been lucky enough to enjoy it with him. I'm in my mid-20s, and to be able to see television clips of Mr. Brooks that would be otherwise unavailable to me is a precious treasure.

If you're wondering whether these 5 DVDs and a CD are worth the $60 you'll pay for them, the answer is ""YES, YES, a million times yes!""

I love you, Mel Brooks. Never change.",1353888000,32,781,4.091503267973856
5185186,5,B008VIMLXM,"I haven't bought this yet - but I will! If for nothing else, it has the audio from the old, old David Susskind TV show in which Mel Brooks, along with some other guys, talked about Jewish mothers - and much more. Yes, I saw the original show - and remember it being laugh-out-loud funny - Brooks was in superb form - and the whole show - conversation-style - was terrific. I never forgot it. There was only one guy who was a jerk - but they just ignored him. Hooray - at long, long last! Sincerely, Judy (she can't remember what she did yesterday, but some things she never forgets)  Brinkworth",1353715200,,594,4.303571428571429
5185187,5,B008VIMLXM,"As a Mel Brooks fan, I am so grateful for this box (book, rather)of treasures, and I'm having such a good time watching it.  It's just a delicous spread of lunacy and information about one of the funniest men alive. The amount of content and elegance of the packaging made the price much easier to swallow.

Speaking of which...doesn't Amazon discount, like, everything?  For some reason they're only shaving off a whopping few cents. I ended up finding this for MUCH cheaper at dvdempire.com ($63.99!!)but even Barnes and Noble has it for $72.",1353283200,25,544,4.827956989247312
5185188,5,B008VIMLXM,"I have spent the last week literally falling off my sofa watching this wonderful collection of Mel Brooks material - at least 75% of it new to me - and I'm a huge MB fan. This should NOT be confused with a set called The Mel Brooks Collection - which is a repackaging of all of Brooks' feature films.

While Shout Factory - a company formed by former Rhino exec Richard Foos - releases some great DVD and CD packages (with creative packaging too!) this time they partnered with Brooks' own company- Brooksfilm - and that gave them access to lots of rare material AND new introductions by Brooks himself. Look at the running time (11 hours!) and know that much of this material has either not been seen in the US ( The ""Audience With..."" comes from the BBC) or is newly created (""I Thought I was Taller.. A Short History of Mel Brooks"", a new five-part ""Mel and His Movies"", which has Mel discussing every one of his films, or hasn't been seen in 50 years (the TV commercials he made with Dick Cavett. Speaking of Cavett, HBO showed an hour of Cavett and Brooks last year, but it's never been out on DVD, and here we get ""bonus footage"". Many MB fans know he created the TV show ""Get Smart"" and the ""long forgotten"" series ""When Things Were Rotten"" but we also get to see the pilot for ""Inside Danny Barker"" - written two years before ""Get Smart"", and directed by Arthur Hiller before HE became famous. It may be the only unfunny 25 minutes on this set - it's a domestic sitcom - but at least we get to see it.

In addition to the five DVDs there is a CD with the audio from two TV talk shows (David Susskind and Les Crane) plus the ""songs"" that we all know, and love, from MB's films. The discs are all packed in a 60 page hard-bound book with great essays and photos. And yes, the 2000-year old man is here - there's even an hour-long documentary about it.

I could go on and on but if you are a MB fan - and that's probably why you found my review - you need this set! No doubt about it. You'll re-watch your favorite moments  -and, probably, like me - show parts of this to your friends and family to show them breadth of Brooks talent (writer, director, composer, stand-up comic, and very-very-very funny guy!)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5185201,4,B008VIMLXM,"Mel Brooks is the comic genius of our generation.  This set shows where he came from, how he developed his craft on Sid Caesar's ""Show of Shows"" (what a writing staff - Woody Allen was just a typist!).

5185202,3,B008VIMLXM,Some funny and interesting parts but this drags on and on.  Overall I was disappointed & am having difficulty finishing the last discs.  You do get a feeling for Brooks' genius but at the cost of hours and hours of viewing.,1377302400,4,223,4.414634146341464

5185205,5,B008VIMLXM,"This set is a comprehensive look at the life and career of Mel Brooks -- often in his own words.  If you like Mel Brooks' work and love to laugh this set is for you.  It provides interviews with Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson; there are commercials written and narrated by Mr. Books.  There's also a pilot of a sitcom he created in the early 60s (not to mention his contributions to the ground-breaking series ""Get Smart"").  Several bits he performed with Carl Reiner as the 2,000-year-old man are also included.  Truly a must have collection.",1376006400,3,539,4.631578947368421

5185209,4,B008VIMLXM,"Was a Dad's day gift and it was a much bigger hit than I though it would be, along with the blu Ray set. I watched a few as a kid with my father but had no idea and was absolutely floored to find that my dad was literally reciting blazing saddles word for word. That's what made this set even more special, it was new ""material"" to him which was nice. Blu Ray would have been the only improvement I would request but that's me not him, he's happy.",1373155200,,447,3.977777777777778
5185210,2,B008VIMLXM,"I think Mel Brooks is one of the funniest persons around and was really looking forward to this collection.

First the good news: the packaging is impeccable and professional.  If this is representative of what Shout Factory produces, it really bodes well for other things they bring out.

But the content of this collection falls flat.  The best piece is the conversation that he has with Dick Cavett and the highlight of that was Cavett's story about Jack Benny.  The rest is a bit droning, repetitive, and thoroughly redundant for anyone familiar with Brooks' work.

You'd be better off spending some time with the 2000 Year Old Man recordings or watching The Producers or Blazing Saddles again.  Very disappointing collection and not worthy of Brooks or his devoted fans.",1372723200,3,775,4.961240310077519
5185211,5,B008VIMLXM,What can I say...? Mel Brooks is a master of slap-stick humor. His silliness and/or stupidity is so incredibly profound. I recommend this collection to people of all ages.,1372204800,,171,4.931034482758621
5185212,4,B008VIMLXM,"This is packaged more like a book. You have to really like Mel Brooks to buy this,if you do you'll be very happy. There is a lot to see and hear. Also the CD with songs from his movies & more was really a plus. I now have the theme to ""Blazing Saddles"" in my music library!",1370736000,,273,3.807017543859649

5185214,5,B008VIMLXM,"My dad is a huge Mel Brooks fan and this was the perfect gift!  He loved it!  I have very fond memories of growing up and watching ""Young Frankenstein"" together (back then, I didn't even understand the jokes, but I still loved it).  It was nostalgic for me to be able to give this set to him!",1366848000,,292,4.087719298245614
5185215,5,B008VIMLXM,My son was assigned a school project and chose to research Mel Brooks.  We purchased the set and had a fabulous time watching together.  It provided great insights behind a unique man and his journey to make people laugh.  Both the boy and the man learned and laughed so much.,1365811200,4,276,4.48
5185216,5,B008VIMLXM,I got this for one of my best friends who loves Mel Brooks.  He was very impressed with the things in this set that he'd never had the chance to see or hear before.  This was a big hit and I'm so glad I found it for him.,1364083200,,220,3.5625

5185221,1,B008VIMLXM,"I sent this wonderful collection to my brother for Christmas.  He was delighted but what he just let me know is that the packaging was horrific and the package was nearly destroyed in shipment, and neither the wrapping nor the card I paid for were included.  He had guessed it was from me because we share a love of Mel but what a disappointing thing to find that my well thought out note and wrapping I'd paid for didn't make it into Amazon's automated system.

And, because you cannot complain about packaging past 60 days, I'm forced to lodge my complaint in the area reserved for the product itself.

Way to go Amazon.  Nice customer service.",1361145600,8,646,4.5344827586206895

He talks about his early days working in the Catskills and learning to play drums from Buddy Rich.

It includes bits from television appearances with Dick Cavett, Tracey Ullman, Johnny Carso, Mike Wallace, ""Circus Nuts"" advertisements with Dick Cavett, as well as segments from his movies, those he wrote and those in which he appeared.  The 2000 Year Old Man is back.

Mel and his associates introduce each segment on the DVDs and they include all his famous films and routines including The Producers, Blazing Saddles,"" and ""Young Frankenstein.""  Some of the movies had more than comedic entertainment behind them and he talks about the messages and inspiration.

I have one major complaint about the collection: Too much repetition!  Some stories are told three or more times.  It takes a long time to go through all the material and, while enjoyable, it should have had more editing.",1359763200,10,1071,4.977528089887641

Between double entendres and insider jokes, as in ""History of the World, Part One"", he is hysterical. When we went to see the movie in the theater, the laughter was so loud that it drowned out many of the lines. We had to go back three times to hear all the lines.  Making it even better, nothing is untouchable. Everything and everyone is subject to his genius skewering, including himself.",1356912000,,493,4.477777777777778

But there are also a lot of fillers, including material that begs for further editing because a story from Disk 1 is retold for the umpteenth time by Disk 5. Still, it's a pleasure to immerse yourself in the mind and personality of a man who shows that it isn't just talent that predicts success, but the overwhelming chutzpah to convince others of your confidence in your talent.",1356825600,7,513,4.711111111111111
