8246486,1,B0012K53RW,"For those desiring the full-length version of DIXIANA, including the restored technicolor sequence featuring Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, avoid this Alpha Video release at all costs.

The only DVD release of the complete DIXIANA, with beautiful early technicolor sequences intact, is the Roans release in 2000. Worth the money if you want the best version -- restored by UCLA film archives.",1275264000,15,388,5.466666666666667
