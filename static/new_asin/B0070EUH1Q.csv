5046362,5,B0070EUH1Q,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this! I was completely jazzed when I heard about the discovery of the Titanoboa and then saw the Smithsonian Channel made a dvd about it, I was even more jazzed. It's definitely intriguing and teaches you a couple different things not just about this snake but Anaconda's and constrictors in general, which I found interesting. Worth the money and watch for sure!",1359849600,3,393,4.96969696969697
5046363,4,B0070EUH1Q,"This is a quite good document about the discovery and analysis of remains of the greatest snake ever found until now. It also tries to reconstruct the life of this unique creature by using CGI, which allows us to have a glimpse into a still quite obscure but passionating time in Earth's history - the Paleocene (65 to 56 mllion years ago).

The remains of this gigantic snake were found in Venezuela, in coal mines of Cerrejon. It soon became clear that this creature, named Titanoboa cerrejonensis, was the longest, largest and heaviest snake ever discovered. It is considered that adult Titanoboa could grow as long as 15 meters (50 feet), had the diameter of 1 meter at the thickest part of the body and weighed as much as 1135 kg (2500 pounds)!

The description of the discovery and analysis of remains is quite interesting, although maybe slightly too long. It is followed by a general lesson about the constrictor snakes in which we can watch one of the scientists being attacked and bitten by a pretty large anaconda... The part about the life and habits of Titanoboa was pretty well done, although you should not expect anything as good as ""Walking with dinosaurs"". Other than some crocodiles and turtles and a piece of swamp we do not see much about the Paleocene, but it is already more than in any other document about paleonthology (in ""Walking with beasts"" series this period was entirely bypassed). It was a quite unique moment in Earth's history, very wet and VERY hot, when mammals were still relatively small and so the top of the food chain was occupied by giant flightless birds, oversized snapping turtles, huge crocodiles and absolutely enormous snakes...

There is a hint at an even bigger (in all the meanings of this word) possible discovery that was recently identified in Cerrejon findings, but I will provide no spoilers here - you will have to watch this document until the end.

Bottom line, this is a very honest document about a unique, fascinating giant predator living in unique, fascinating and still very little known times... Enjoy!",1348790400,9,2069,4.819718309859155

5046365,5,B0070EUH1Q,"I originally bought this for my dad, the snake lover, after my daughter and I saw a re-creation of this snake at the Smithsonian Museum in DC.  My (5 yr old) daughter really wanted to see it once before we sent it to Grandpa, and ended up watching it 5 times!  I had to buy our own copy.  It completely held both of our interest.  There is a lot of footage of real snakes (anacondas) and they walk you through the whole process, from the moment they find the largest snake vertabrae ever discovered, till they're able to re-create a life sized model.  There's even a disection of an anaconda.  Great movie!",1341360000,,606,4.366071428571429

5046388,1,B0070EUH1Q,"Despite the title, there is precious little substance about ""Titanoboa: Monster Snake"".  The Smithsonian Channel, much like National Geographic, simply fills 32 minutes with the Smithsonian, their geologists, zoologists, other ologists, and their efforts at getting funding for their digs.

And the narration, OMG! If I hear one more phony historian or narrator use the present tense when talking about the past, I shall scream! Events in the PAST are described in the PAST tense!",1377907200,,480,5.386666666666667

5046391,5,B0070EUH1Q,"If one looks at the dangerous animals in the world today, they pale in comparison to this creature from the past.  I live in Florida, and I've seen the destruction the snakes have done in the Everglades.  But just imagine the chaos this snake could cause humanity?  It would be devouring everything it could reach, nothing living would be safe from it.  There is a good reason why these creatures no longer exist, I think its because humanity would have trouble surviving these predators.  I highly recommend this dvd ,  not just as a teaching tool, but as an example of what our maker has created.  He made the wise decision not to allow it to survive.

5046392,5,B0070EUH1Q,"History is full of barried stories.  My only wish is that those men and women who spend their time uncovering them stay more to the facts rather than filling in all the colors.

No doubt about it.  This was a big boa.  However;  it needs more facts, and not more drama.  They thru out the movie forget to state one thing.  "" This is the larges snake we found"" instead they hold to pride and brovado.  By saying too often that its the largest snake ever.  To be honest.  It could be either way.  But facts are that snake was one of many and it could have been a runt.

I also find it frustrating these time frames.  I wish they would stop trying to guess at time using millions and billions concepts.  It sounds so uneducated like little kids saying a gizillion years ago.  Cause its clear that the people in the areas where these snakes where found made stone ephigies to either show they defeated them and or worshiped them and were there at the same time as these large mega snakes.

Anywho.  I am typing this on my phone, so I am just going to close with.

Events and history are always finding that which was barried.  I enjoy the facts.  But I myself would like the drama of ideals of how these animals lived to be left out to some extent, cause truth is we don't know anything other than that they at one point did.",1368489600,,1321,4.208
5046393,5,B0070EUH1Q,"For the person interested in Herpetology,  fossil finds and true life facts this is the DVD for you...  It answers the  questions; of is it real, where was it discovered, when it was found and who found it, how many different disciplines contributed to it's completion for exhibit.  Excellent  presentation..",1367280000,2,308,5.08
5046394,5,B0070EUH1Q,"You just don't get any more badass than the Titanoboa.  I'm talking 48 feet long, 2500 pounds - this behemoth ate large crocodiles for breakfast.  Go out there and look up an image comparing Titanoboa vertebra to that of a modern day Amazon boa constrictor - there is no comparison.  This snake pumped out babies bigger than any fully grown boa constrictor or python on earth today.  This excellent documentary takes you all the way from the unexpected discovery of the first giant snake fossils to the awesome reconstruction that brings Titanoboa as close to life as it has been in 60 million years.

So where did this monster live?  Well, the fossils of Titanoboa and a plethora of other giant reptiles were hiding underground in the Cerrejn region of La Guajira, Colombia until a coal mining company showed up and started digging.  Fortunately, scientists were given access to the site and started finding fossilized leaves and various bones that created the picture of a miniature little rain forest that existed immediately following the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs - an era scientists know relatively little about due to a lack of fossils.  In this lush marshy playground, Titanoboa ruled supreme, growing supersized in the abnormally warm climate and constricting the life out of anything that had the misfortune of getting in its way.

Not only do you get to watch graduate students and scientists get excited about this find of a lifetime, you also get to watch a couple of them go wading for anacondas as part of their study of Titanoboa's closest living cousin.  Apparently, the best way to find anacondas is to go walking barefoot in the marshy waters they call home.  Sometimes, though, as one scientist learns, the snake finds you before you find it.  Fortunately, since anacondas are non-venomous constrictors, a nasty bite doesn't kill you.

This is a great documentary, especially for those of us fascinated by snakes.  Titanoboa is even bigger than the unbelievably large monster snakes Hollywood has given us over the years.  The day of the anaconda pretenders is now definitively over - Titanoboa was, is, and always will be King of the Snakes.",1364515200,,2179,4.947802197802198
