Yes I do still have them for my VCR, but now a days everything is coming out on DVD, so I decided to purchase this.

1849153,5,B00008K79L,"I remember this movie from some time ago. I have been a fan of Lisa Hartman since her Tabitha days. This movie was like going back to high school, big hair and shoulder pads. Linda Evans will always be a Dynasty Diva no matter what.. It is predictable, good fun. For those who like the Harlequin movies, you will enjoy this.",1358208000,,324,4.327868852459017

1849157,5,B00008K79L,"What can you say about a movie...with today's so called ""realistic movies,or those that have so called ""social messages"", the old ones are such a relief to watch. We watch movies for entertainment value and are able to relax and enjoy. This is a wonderful movie and ends ""everyone lives happily ever after. No thought, or worry involved. A nice break from the day.
I'm so glad we can still purchase them..no matter how corney they are.",1318118400,3,435,4.662337662337662

7984913,2,B00008K79L,"I'm a big fan of Judith Krantz books, and I always loved Dazzle because of the character, who reminded me of the female protagonist in I'll Take Manhattan.

However, the story is practically unrecognizable other than the names of the characters and some very basic sketchings of the plot. Present-day things, things that happened ten years ago, and things that happened twenty years ago are all mashed together in a single time period. Most of the plot -- particularly the moxie that made Jazz so interesting -- is gone. Plus Lisa Hartman looks way too old.

If I wasn't comparing it with the book, it might have been okay, but I was looking for a retelling on the order of Mistral's Daughter, which I thought was a much better re-creation.",1417305600,,740,4.684615384615385
