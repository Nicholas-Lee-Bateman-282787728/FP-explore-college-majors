8462203,4,B000NDIB1E,This cartoon is nice. It's really creative and characters are lovely. Graphics is a bit old but this version of Cinderella is better than Disney's. We watched cartoons like these when we were kids and this is kind of flashback.,1362787200,,227,4.7
8462204,2,B000NDIB1E,"This was the old cinderella, we grew up watching on VHS.  It's an older version 2D, but kids love watching it as it is slow and not too much confusing graphics.",1196380800,2,160,4.161290322580645
