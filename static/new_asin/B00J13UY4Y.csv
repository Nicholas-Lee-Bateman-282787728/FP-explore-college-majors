8658547,5,B00J13UY4Y,"Seeing as I am the first to review this film I feel compelled to express my feelings about it as honestly as possible. Overall this is a good family film, great for halloween, since it deals with a haunted manor and creepy spooks. I think the Mexican animation studio did a great job portraying what a Day of the Dead movie should be like. I mean, sure there are hundreds of halloween-themed cartoons, movies, books, etc. out there, but there were no Day of the Dead anything until this movie. I personally thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is that of a very cowardly boy named Leo. Leo lives in Puebla, a town in which a manor close to his house is said to be haunted by the evil spirit of a servant who worked there, or, 'La Nahuala.' On the evening of Day of the Dead Leo receives a strange medallion from a local candy salesman as a talisman to ward off evil, but Leo's brother takes it and thinks it funny to hide it from Leo inside the hunted manor Leo fears so much. This ends up causing Leo's brother to be abducted by the manor's spirit and Leo must for once be brave if he wishes to get his brother back.
Overall, the film is both funny, entertaining and suspenseful, the perfect scary movie for a group of kids or even teens who do not wish to watch a gory horror film.",1412380800,,1279,4.245901639344262
