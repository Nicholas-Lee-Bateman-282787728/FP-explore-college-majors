1946581,4,B0000UJL8C,"Imagine Candid Camera on steroids... done with celebrities!  They do a nice job on this show.  The host makes sure you know who the celebrities are and explains the practical joke and how it will be set up.  But this is not your ordinary practical joke!  Imagine this... how do you think Frankie Muniz, the star of ""Malcolm in the Middle"", reacts when he thinks his very expensive Porsche has been stolen?  HA!  What a riot!
In general, the transfer to DVD is done nicely.  The video in full screen format is very decent, just a little graininess.  The video quality is certainly better than cable.  The stereo 2.0 sound is acceptable.  The voices are very clear and easy to understand.  I'm not sure what the movie rating on this would be, but there is plenty of strong language and gestures not used in polite company.
The extras are better than average.  Several are very funny, including deleted scenes that you access by pressing enter when an icon appears.  There are two bonus pranks that are worth watching.  Funny stuff.  I love to hear them say, ""I got PUNK'T!""",1074556800,10,1071,4.592592592592593

The best part of the entire show is that Celeberties are the victems of Ashton.  Yes celeberties entertain us through TV, music, movies and action sports and etc.  and they really entertain us here.  It is very entertaining to watch the people who entertain us entertain us once again in this hilarious show.  What do you get when Justin Timberlake's property is seized?  ""You took away my dogs?""  And unfortunately for Frankie Muniz his $250,000 car is stolen.  More show up at the red carpet and the crew ask celeberties stupid questions.

1946600,3,B0000UJL8C,"I bought this DVD last week because it was only US$7, and I hadn't seen any of these episodes on TV, since I don't have satellite TV...well, the first time it was great, it was so funny, and not that long, so cool. The second time, it was still funny, but not as much as the first time, but after the third time it started making me sick, I found the stories boring, plus I had already seen each of them twice, just bad. Thank God I didn't spend 24 bucks to buy it!

I think that if I had MTV at home, I wouldn't have bought it.",1141862400,,528,3.888888888888889
1946601,5,B0000UJL8C,"This is it! Season 2 of Punk'd is easily among the best seasons of the show ever, if not the greatest. And since sadly, it's still the last season of Punk'd to be available on DVD today, it's not like you have much of a choice on which one to purchase anyway.

The segments with Hilary Duff, Katie Holmes, Jaime Pressly and Amber Tamblyn are among the most successful pranks the show has ever done. A person has asked what's the point of owning a TV show and watching an episode you've already seen. It's fun! It makes you laugh out loud and cry from laughing too hard. Like any good comedy, Punk'd can be equally funny on repeat viewing, you might just have to shelve it for a month or two -- but then, really, that's the same for any DVD.

The only two gripes I have with this DVD are the jarringly inferior video quality of the deleted scenes and that the first disc starts with lengthy advertisements for other MTV DVDs. They can be skipped, but you'll have to press your Next Chapter button several times until you finally get to the main menu.

Now if only MTV would finally release the next seasons on DVD...",1126137600,6,1115,4.3253588516746415
1946602,4,B0000UJL8C,"The first season is always special in a television show's life, especially when they manage to live on for subsequent seasons. Punk'd is now past its 5th season at the time I'm writing this, and the show didn't completely master its present-day formula until its second season.

As such, this season is clearly more experimental and less refined than it has become later on. The most noticeable difference is of course that roughly once per episode, they're pulling pranks on random everyday people, rather than celebrities.

That's not to say this season isn't worth owning; in fact, some would argue Punk'd didn't get any better than this. I don't agree with the latter and don't hold Season 1 too high among my favorites, although there are some fun pranks to be found here, such as the one with Jessica Alba.

Matching the first season's experimental nature, the DVD itself is also less refined than that of Season 2. The most annoying omission is that the feature to watch all bonus deleted segments without having to sit through the original episodes is not yet available here. The presentation is all right otherwise; video quality is nice other than the deleted scenes - an unfortunate trait shared with the Season 2 DVD - and some minor glitches in the second episode's segment with Mandy Moore.",1126137600,3,1304,4.838565022421525

I remember I was so excited when they had MTV Jams on and they played nothing but strait up banging hip hop from the 1990s. Then there was the Lyricist Lounge. for you people that only watch todays rap videos you missed it. It was just dudes having skits and just doing great rapping. Look at 106 Park and Freestyle Fridays and times that by a hundred and your close to the Lyricist Lounge. some of the members were Kweli-Mos-Words-Em-Big and even of tight people who are no names. and as plain white said bring back shows such as The Tom Green Show are atleast put out some DVDs. As for this junk I believe it is a step or two a head of the excellent show-Pimp my Ride. Tell MTV to start showing some PIMP rap from 1994 like Nas or Snoop are DJ Premier beats.

1946610,1,B0000UJL8C,"Okay, okay, not really. I would never in a million years buy this DVD set. I already saw it on MTV, thank GAWD!, and would never buy it. Here's why!

First of all the premise. If you analyze other Hidden Camera shows, the sucess factor is based on, not limiting yourself to your ""marks."" That is, this show ""punk's"" famous people. Well, that is limiting yourself from the start.

Now, what happens if the taped segment isn't funny? Well, if you're Jamie Kennedy, you turn to another ""mark"" and tape another segment. You do this 3 or 4 times (or more, I suppose) until you get the superfunny segment.

Well, herein lies the problem with Punk'd. Since they only ""fool"" famous people, they are limited to that once (or twice) that they get a believeable take. And, as someone like me knows, (a long time fan of these ""prank, hidden camera/microphone/video camera shows) successful segments don't necessarily happen the first take.

That's why shows like Jamie Kennedy, and other ""Candid Camera"" segments are successful, and why Punk'd isn't. The other shows have the luxury of depending on more segments to capture a successful and FUNNY segment. Punk'd is not successful, and NOT funny! Anyone who thinks it is, is falling on the already established liking of Ashton Kutcher, the famous people, MTV, or have never been exposed to a funny program, such as Jamie Kennedy.

A typical segment shows Ashton explaining, laughing, about the segment, in a fashion of somebody who is probably enjoying it, more than his audience. You know the type. Somebody who laughs half-way through telling you a joke? You don't laugh, and wonder why you are even listening? Same thing for this show. The audience is wondering when they will laugh as hard as the host.

Reading the other reviews, I was not surprised to see so many negative reviews. This show is not funny, and very un-deserving of even a second season. Please do not renew or even show re-runs of this show, MTV. A real stinker. Two ""W's"" down!",1100563200,4,1988,4.747826086956522

The profanity and language (uncut) on the dvd is downright foul and a turn off....just bleeping it you can get the same effect without having to hear the negative vibes of bad language....

ashton seems to be more involved with these skits as he's workign the backroom on each one as opposed to first season where near half of the shows ashton doesn't come in at the end and say gotcha!
