2463631,5,B000CFX78U,I love Richard Simmons workouts. I have not yet tried one I didn`t like. And this one was great. It was a great and fun workout to great music.,1384473600,2,143,3.9655172413793105
2463632,3,B000CFX78U,it's ok.,1241395200,,8,3.5
2463633,5,B000CFX78U,"This is one of the best video workouts I have ever done. It is challening enough to make you sweat but still is not too hard.
  The very first time I tried it I almost didn't make it through do everything correctly. Now, I have noticed a big change as all the workouts are getting easier but still challenging. I especially liked the Ab workout. Overall this is a good workout for anybody who wants to tone up.",1230508800,5,410,4.243589743589744
2463634,5,B000CFX78U,I really enjoy this video.  The workout is with very good if you are just starting out.,1171584000,,87,4.117647058823529
2463635,3,B000CFX78U,"I have the two VHS combo Tonin' Uptown and Tonin' Downtown. Combined, that series is an hour long work out and *exhausting*. But the results I've achieved have been amazing, and got me in great shape.

Unfortunately, I played the heck out of those VHS tapes (I got them in 1997), and they no longer work! I was going to pull them out to get in shape once again!

So I looked through the DVD's offered here, especially the toning ones (I still have the two rubber stretch bands with padded handles from the other series). I purchased Supertonin' Totally Tonin'...especially because it features 80's music.

My son has been using this for fun (kids!), and I just now joined him for the workout. Surprisingly, I barely broke a sweat with this under-30 minutes DVD! (And believe me, I'm pretty out of shape. The Tonin' Uptown and Downtown would have kicked my butt!)

The moves are super-simple, but the warm up doesn't even get your heart pumping (like the Uptown/Downtown did). This DVD features all the same upper body exercises that are on the Uptown VHS, but not quite as intense.

Surprisingly, there's only a little bit of ab work and the only lower body work was during the warm up and cool down! That's right: no leg lifts at all! So this is mostly a quick, easy upper body stretch workout.

This would be an excellent DVD for those who are obese, waaaaay out of shape, and for children. I suppose it's good to do *some* exercise--and this DVD may tone a *little*--but it's not going to do anything cardio wise or fat burning wise, in my opinion.

There are fun 80's hits like Physical, Funkytown, a fast version of The Greatest Love of All, and The Greatest American Hero. None of these are sung by the original artists, though, which is no biggie.

There are no cheesy extras in this DVD (as there was in the Uptown/Downtown series--a fake ""band"", Supremes-like back-up singers, and lifeguards)--so that's great. It's set up in a fake mall center court, featuring men and women of all sizes and shapes.

Richard is, as usual, very encouraging and upbeat.

It's a good beginner DVD, all in all, but not that great if you want to get your heart pumping or want to burn fat through toning.

Note: this version does NOT come with the toning rings! If you don't have any at home, make sure you order ASIN: B000DH32Z0 instead.",1149638400,42,2327,4.569711538461538
2463636,5,B000CFX78U,I bought this DVD thinking it was just going to be similar to Richard Simmon's past video's..I love this DVD! Richard makes this video so much fun and he gives you the best tonin workout!  I especially enjoyed the music that he used in the background..I love 80's music.  I also noticed that you can buy his Cd's on amazon I'm looking into buying some of his work out Cd's..This was definately a great purchase.,1143158400,13,411,4.466666666666667

2463641,5,B000CFX78U,"This video was everything I could dream of and more.  When I was searching for the ""perfect"" workout video and I saw this I thought, the combination of perspiration, 80s music and Richard Simmons could quite possibly be the recipe for  pure satisfaction.  Let me just tell you, this video delivers.  I can't really speak for getting tone because I just watch from my recliner but it has done wonders for my calorie intake.  With the loss of appetite I've experience while watching I've been able to stay well below my recommended calories.  Sometimes even cutting them by more than half.  When I feel cravings coming on, I just pop in the video and instantly they're gone.",1453852800,,672,4.6923076923076925

2463649,5,B000CFX78U,This is really great for toning!  I had lost some weight and wanted to tone up and this did the trick for me.  I used this video 5 days a week saw results in my  arms and abs within a few weeks.  Those areas were my main concern but I also saw results in all areas targeted in this video.  I have continued to use it and am VERY happy I liked it so well I ordered it for my daughter. I also ordered the Toning & Fitness Exercise Ring with Foam Handles in both the light and medium from Amazon to use with it.  I wish it had a section for legs :-(,1416182400,3,546,3.745614035087719
2463650,5,B000CFX78U,"I purchased the first DVD probably more than 20 years ago and it finally wore out.  I was so happy that it is still available.  It is certainly not high aerobic but at 71 yrs, it keeps muscles toned and flexible.  I wore out the bands many years ago, just wish I could find more.  I use weights in place now.",1414022400,9,308,4.0
2463651,5,B000CFX78U,Great little fun exercise DVD,1412380800,,29,5.0
2463652,3,B000CFX78U,Again I wish they included the rings that are shown on the cover.  That is the only reason for only 3 stars.  The exercise is very good.  Or at least he could tell you when to use weight instead and how many pounds to use.  I notice that he uses different colors which I think means different strengths.  So please tell us the difference in exertion.,1407888000,3,350,4.242424242424242

2463655,2,B000CFX78U,"I am on my second copy of this DVD and need to return it AGAIN!!  This particular DVD does not play!! The first one did not play either!  A bad batch maybe?? The sellers claim they test them but they must have missed these 2, (though they were from different sellers,)  All the other Richard Simmons DVDs my daughter and I bought from Amazon play fine, even the cheapest ones, so there must be something wrong with this ""Supertonin"" one.  I would like to have a copy, though, if I would be guaranteed it would play!  Kathleen Sattler",1404086400,,533,4.3979591836734695
