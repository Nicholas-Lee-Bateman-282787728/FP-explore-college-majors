2063255,5,B0002606BA,"As with ANY Reiki Teacher, I was skeptical at first.  What could a DVD do for me?  The actual DVD program SEEMS simple - meditate upon a crystal doing some hand positions - done.  But that's NOT the whole experience.  I found that by taking much needed time to work on my own healing, something I feel most energy workers don't do often enough, I was able to connect to a deeper level in my ability to work with clients.  As with most universal experiences that enhance ones own connection, the healing and changes I had, have shown up within the days and weeks since my first use of this DVD.  I found myself hearing Steve's voice, the beautiful music and seeing the crystal in my mind's eye - which would make me feel so connected to my own healing process.  Nice thing is that by owning the DVD, I [you] can take this moment time and again, as needed.  Are you going to feel instantly healed?, maybe - maybe not.  That doesn't mean something didn't take place - trust in this process and trust in your own ability to bring to this table what you will need to also have a great experience.  I'm very happy I tried and own this DVD.",1219708800,2,1133,4.276995305164319
2063256,5,B0002606BA,"Empowering!!
I am by nature open minded but cautious. I read Steve's website top to bottom and was inspired by the truth as I read it. It resonated with something deep inside me. I was very drawn to his openness and perspectives on Reiki and decided that this was the right path to follow. I have not been disappointed at all!!  Very congruent in all his writing and his mission statement.
His DVD's and books empower you on whatever level you are interested in learning. He is a true teacher. You can read it, see it and feel the energy.
Thank you so much Steve for all your insightful information and for sharing all your knowledge with everyone in an affordable way. This was a smart investment for me. I am truly grateful and much more knowledgeable.",1219708800,,754,4.5036496350364965
2063257,5,B0002606BA,"I would love to detail all of the specifics of what I found interesting and helpful from the books and DVDs in this system, but that would surely take up more time and room than this space allows, lol. Suffice it to say that those Reiki recipients whom I have been working with for some time have commented that they notice an increase in Reiki power -- and they didn't know that I had been doing further study with Steve Murray's Usui Reiki system products; they simply knew something was different. As a newly-signed author myself, I love his writing style; Steve is straight to the point without unnecessary wording --- I like and appreciate that.
Steve Murray's books and DVDs and absolutely priceless and will remain in my personal library as invaluable reference materials in the years to come. I do and will recommend them to anyone that I believe would be interested. I also see that his new book and DVD will be released soon. I plan to purchase and study those also ;)

2063258,5,B0002606BA,"I concur with all the positive things the other reviewers have said about Steve Murray's great books, DVDs and CDs.  The important thing with the DVDs in my view is that they should be watched over and over again, not only for the attunements, but for the wonderful meditation experience you will have.  I watch one of the attunement DVDs every other day or so and find that my day goes better when I do!",1211587200,,404,4.373333333333333
2063259,5,B0002606BA,"If you can send and receive distant healing via a Reiki healer, then you can and will receive Reiki healing via a DVD. I am a Reiki Master (thanks to Steve Murray's Master DVD attunement)and purchased this to help me through the emotional impact of a pending divorce. As I was watching the DVD, I was also doing self-Reiki. During the healing treatment, I could actually feel the depression lifting as a physical sensation and felt an incredible peace and emotional warmth. I've done a lot of self-Reiki, but never felt the intensity or the immediate relief as I did with this DVD healing attunement. If you are in need of physical, emotional, mental or spiritual healing, buy this DVD and... well..heal. To become a Reiki practioner, obtain your attunements and gain knowledge of Reiki through Steve Murray's complete set of books and DVD's.

2063260,5,B0002606BA,"I have many of Steve Murray Reiki DVDs, and they are the best. The Reiki DVDs do pass the Reiki Attunements very well. And the Reiki Books are very informative and easy to understand. I love the photos and drawings in the books because it makes what he explains very easy to comprehend.

From reading the reviews of the few people who do not like him because of his books and DVDs, it looks like to me these are the Reiki people he writes about in his Reiki False Beliefs Exposed for all. LOL no wonder they dislike him and his work. He has exposed them and they are angry. It is this small group of people who only want you to learn Reiki their way, because they think their way is the only way, and they are always right. And by coincidence it's usually the most expensive way to learn Reiki, and with them giving classes.

The big difference between Mr. Murray and his detractors is that he teaches you can learn Reiki many ways and his teachings are one option; just make your own decision with learning Reiki with what works the best for you. Every person has Reiki naturally. What books, DVDs and classes show you is how to use it for yourself and others. In fact some people use Reiki successfully without any guidance or teachings. Most of Mr. Murray's critics do not want you to know this either.

From reading a few of Mr. Murray's reviews it seems he has changed people's lives around the world, so he is doing a good thing. Mr. Murray's Reiki teachings are not for all, but at least he is open minded to know this, and would never tell you his Reiki path is the only correct one.

We are not ""Steve Murray students"", but have had many years of healing and energy work experience. This DVD makes it so easy. You can feel it working immediately. We highly recommend this DVD, and the rest of Steve Murray's books and DVD's.

2063263,5,B0002606BA,"I have read all the Reiki books by Steve Murray ( I have experienced all his attunements too ). And I can assure you there is nothing like this material in the market ( and I have a huge Reiki library ).
The books are clear and concise, containing all the information a Reiki person of any level shoul be able to find ( sadly that does not happen due to the secrecy and vested interest of some people in the Reiki world).

The DVDs are fatastic tools ( they are as powerful as in person attunements, and who say the contrary does not really understand the mechanics of Reiki or does not want to).

It is true that the books do not contain pictures of standard hand positions or the history of Usui Sensei and Mrs Takata ( but every other single book in the market does, so I truly understand Steve Murray not needing to repeat then once again and concetrate in the material that so far has been kept hiden for not a very good reason at all).

Resume : This is truly the best material any Reiki person should have in his or her library.

2063264,5,B0002606BA,"Steve Murray's Reiki books are well worth purchasing, whether you are a beginner wishing to learn, or an intermediate student looking for reference material. His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.

The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.

I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.

I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism.",1196208000,,1561,4.8830188679245285
2063265,5,B0002606BA,"I had taken Reiki Level 1 and Level 2 from a Reiki Master in Sedona, AZ,  and felt that I wanted to further my Reiki education, but didn't know where to start.  I had questions about Reiki that my Reiki Master couldn't answer, and so, I didn't feel confident to go out into the world and practice Reiki in a professional setting.  I knew that clients would ask me questions that I, like my Reiki Master, wouldn't be able to answer.  So, I prayed for guidance and asked to be directed to someone who could help me.

Not long after my prayer, I found Steve Murray purely by accident.  I had gone into a bookstore in Sedona, AZ and on a shelf in front of me was his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD.  I was a little skeptical at first, since my Reiki Master had told me that attunements needed to be received in person, but something about his creative use of Reiki intrigued me, so I purchased the DVD, along with Steve's ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" DVD, and I still can't believe the results I received!

I received such powerful attunements from his DVD's!!  I had always been psychic with natural healing abilities, but his attunements seemed to amplify my skills even more!  I began having consistent clairvoyant visions after taking his ""Reiki Psychic Attunement"" DVD, and I received almost instant healing of some stress related conditions, I had been dealing with for some time, shortly after taking his ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", from his DVD.  The results I received were nothing short of miraculous!  I definitely knew then that there was power in his DVD attunements!  And that attunements didn't have to be taken in person in order to be effective!

So, I purchased all the rest of his DVD's and Books and have never been disappointed!!  His Books are written so clearly and concisely that anyone, no matter what their educational background can understand them .  Steve is very generous with the wealth of information he provides in both his Books and his DVD's , and when I was finished (reading his books and taking his attunements) I truly felt I had finally attained a solid foundation from which to practice Reiki professionally.

I ended up finishing my Reiki Master with Steve Murray, and I truly feel it's the best decision that I have ever made!  All my questions about Reiki have finally been answered through his Books and DVD's and I feel so grateful to have found him!

If you are interested in Reiki education, there is no better person to work with than Steve Murray!  I have read many, many Reiki authors and there is no one that comes close!  I am convinced, that the results you'll receive, from Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's, will truly astound you!  As they have truly astounded me!  I don't care what anyone says, distance attunements really work!!!

My dream has been, for sometime now, to practice Reiki professionally, but I was afraid to, because I didn't feel I had all my questions answered. I didn't feel I had a solid foundation from which to work from, but now, because of Steve Murray's Books and DVD's, I feel that I finally have the knowledge and confidence necessary to succeed!  Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's have truly made my dream a reality!  And for that, I will be forever grateful to him!

Whether your goal is to work professionally with Reiki, or to use it to heal and enhance your everyday life, you can't go wrong with Steve Murray's Books and DVD's.  They are truly worth the investment!  I know I will be referring to them for reference, and reinforcement, for many years to come!  God bless Steve Murray!",1195344000,3,3575,4.646496815286624
2063266,5,B0002606BA,"This DVD as well as all of the other DVD,s in Steve's Reiki series are FANTASTIC and really do work.  I try to attune myself with one every night if I can.  I have a blissful, revitalizing sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and energized.  I like alternating the DVD's.  One night I will use the healing DVD and the next night I will use the Reiki level I attunement and so on.  It really works!  Every day I am more conscious of the things that I need to work on and how to go about doing it.  We all have ""issues"" and Reiki is a really great way to work on these issues.  I wholeheartedly reccommend Steve's books and DVD's to anyone who wants to ""work"" on themself and/or to anyone who wants to become a healer.  I am working on myself and becoming a healer as well.

2063267,5,B0002606BA,"This is the first Reiki attunement DVD by Steve Murray I ever tried. Great Idea... why aren't more Medical Intuitives sharing attunements/energy this way?

This makes energy healing easily accessible and low cost (practically nothing, you own the DVD and you can play it over and over as much as you like).

2063268,5,B0002606BA,"I have read all four books and completed 1st, 2nd, and Psychic Level Attunments of Steve Murray.  The power that is in this reading and DVD's is absolutely incredible.  I really like the repetition of emphazing the fact of having an intent before giving Reiki, the power is automatically there to focus on healing.  Truly, there are no words to describe the power connection.  My sister lives in California and I live in Indiana.  I sent her long distance Reiki and she felt it immediately.  It was powerful.

2063269,5,B0002606BA,"Very recently I learned how to create an energy vortex with some of the stones that I owned.  But I could not feel any of the energy emanating from it.  The problem is that I have been feeling very energetically bogged down.  I would lay down by it and feel nothing, meditate (not my strong suit) and again nothing.  For me it was very frustrating because it felt like I was desperately trying to get in contact with someone but was getting an out of service error message instead. I remembered that I haven't used my Reiki video's in quite some time so I took my laptop and played this CD in my sacred space.  When using this video I felt like I suddenly had a fiber optic connection to the source of energetic healing.  It was quite wonderful and within 15 mins of completion I was able to feel the energy of the vortex that I had created.  It was only then that I realized just how strong my creation was.  I forgot how to raise my vibration and because it was so low I could not feel the higher frequency of the stones.  For me Reiki is an important key in helping me with my work.

I have also used this video whenever a relationship has ended.  I'd cry, mourn the loss, delete the number and use this video as my emotional erase button.  Although it didn't really take memories away I felt that it did help me get through the break up faster.

Good Video and a great buy",1170720000,,1376,4.206106870229007
2063270,5,B0002606BA,"I ordered Steve Murry's DVD's after already having been Attuned to Level 1 & 2 by a Reiki Master... I wish I had found these DVD's first. They are State of the Art and perfect in length - I experienced the Attunements and had wonderful experiences, they really do work. If you order his books they complement the CD's and his entire program is hundreds of dollars cheaper then any place else, plus you get to keep the DVD's and rewatch them for reinforement later on. He also has a Pychic DVD that really opened me up to new experiences. This particular DVD is wonderful for receiving a Healing Attunement for yourself - I had a really spiritual experience while watching this Attunement.

I just finished reading all three of Steve Murray's Reiki Ultimate Guide Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 & 3 ...

Vol. 2 & 3 go deeper into using Reiki via Chakras, and the Aura...

These books don't just talk about Reiki they teach you how to apply it

and in several ways, so you can treat those you love, or your clients in a way that is suited to their needs... I wish I had come upon these books first as they are really all that is needed in any Reiki book shelf.

Not to mention once you are a Reiki Master you have his first book that

teaches you; with easy step by step (photos included) on how to pass these

Attunements to others, so you can become a Reiki Master/Teacher as well...

I'm excited to try all the new techniques I've learned - and there are many within the pages, and best yet there are photos with detailed information embedded in them to better help you perform your Reiki Sessions. Another thing I love about this series is you will never get bored of Reiki as your not doing the same thing for each person - which is how it should be in any healing technique.

Steve Murray also teaches in a simple to understand manner and there

is no arrogance involved. I feel his books are inspired to help those of

us that are having trouble finding a Reiki Master or learning Reiki, as he

is open and upfront and doesn't leave anything out.

I bought his DVD's as well, and they are state of the art - so if your having trouble finding a Reiki Master (like I did), then this series is

exceptional. I've been attuned in person by a Reiki Master and via: Steve

Murray's DVDs--and I can say I wish I had found Steve Murray's first as it would have saved me tons of money. Not mention I have the books to refer back to without wondering after My Reiki Master leaves the house, what I'm supposed to do with all the information (and unanswered questions)...

Plus you can get your certificate through his program, and I still don't have mine from my Reiki Master, nor is it easy to reach her as a lot of people seem to have this trouble - making it another great reason to Turn to Steve Murray - as the answers are always there and he has a great support website and even answers my e-mails... And the bonus is; the Certificates really do arrive...

I've enjoyed these programs and I truly believe I was brought to them via

""Divine intervention"" which paved the way for me to find what I was searching for... Whatever you decide in your search for Reiki and it's teachings, may the Universal Life Force energy grace your path...",1164931200,5,3223,4.343333333333334
2063271,5,B0002606BA,"Since all of the great things I would say about the ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" program have already been said many times over, I thought I would share something unique about this Attunement program.

I have taken all 3 of Reiki Master Steve Murray's Reiki Attunements (Levels 1, 2, & 3) by DVD.  The ""Healing Attunement"" program, all 3 of his ""Ultimate Reiki Guide"" handbooks, & the ""Psychic Attement"" DVD, all come with my highest recommendations.  If you want to put the magic & wonder back in your life that you dreamed possible as a kid, studying Reiki is a great way to do it.  If you're an independent type who wants to (or, has been feeling afraid to) really take The Bull By The Horns of your own health care, this DVD - & the entire Reiki training program - is for you.  I have seen SO many wonders worked with Reiki over just the past 18 months, that it would take up a whole night to tell about them.  And because I have these attunements, & I've already learned these things, techically...I really don't need the ""Reiki Healing Attunement"" DVD...I can do the healing Attumenent on myself & others.  Because Murray's ""Level 3 Reiki Attunement"" will prepare you to do them, & his texts will teach you exactly how they're done.

Where this disc comes in handy for me is, those times when I am feeling so sick & run down that I feel I can't effectively focus on channeling Reiki energy to heal myself.  Even Reiki Healers get the flu & suffer injuries.  Instead of doing Healing Attunements on myself, I can play this DVD, sit back, & just let the teacher do the work for me instead. :)  How easy (& lazy!) is that??  When you feel like you've been hit by a freight train & like you are in no space to send Reiki & what you really need is to rest, use this DVD.  For $25 you get a portable Reiki Healer, who shows up to help you any time of day or night.  And you always feel so clear & refreshed when you're done.  If you have crudd (aka ""psychic debris"") built up in your energy field, when you're finished taking this Attunement, it'll be gone.  As with all of the DVDs in this author's collection.

If you're unitintiated in Reiki & simply curious about what it is, the Healing Attunement is also a good way to get your feet wet with this energy & really feel & experience what Reiki is & how it works first hand, before taking the initiative to learn to work with the energy yourself.  If you do nothing more with Reiki than use this DVD for healing sessions, it's ok.  It stands alone in the series for what it does & what it teaches you, & can be used by itself with no other materials or information.  And if you find yourself inspired by what you experience, & go on to become a Reiki Healer, or even a Master yourself...so much the better!  Where you take things is solely up to you.

As everyone will tell you who practices or receives Reiki, the results you experience will vary depending on your need.  There is a wide range of possibilities that may occur, & everyone experiences what they personally need to experience in order to get well, & the healing you experience is unique to you.  Which is to say, please don't assume that what I describe next will automatically happen to you, but it did happen for me & a close friend.

The first time I used this DVD, our health conditions got worse - *much worse* - beginning immediately after receiving the Healing Attunement.  I remember playing it through twice, for myself & a chronically ill friend who watched the DVD with me who shared very similar healing goals.  For a few weeks, as everything unraveled for the both of us & energency appointments were repeatedly made - I really wondered what went wrong here.  I thought the sky was falling, & for a while I was literally afraid to run that DVD again.  *BUT*...!!!  As a result of the complete upheaval & intense exacerbation of symptoms...we were both forced to challenge some less than competent physicians' less than helpful advice, & *really* get to the bottom & the core of some major health issues...& we were forced to push harder toward getting better health care, finding better treatments on our own, & obtaining far more successful treatments from better doctors.  And we did.  And we are both much healthier today & we avoided disaster because of it.  And avoid an unnecessary surgery, in my own case.  Looking back to last year, if we hadn't had that huge mess break loose, & if we had just stayed on the same course that we were traveling - instead of suddenly changing horses midstream in the way of physicians - one of us literally might not be here today, due to an undiagnosed & ignored critical medical condition.  The problem came out in the open where it could finally be dealt with & successfully treated.

What I am describing here - is a ""Reiki Healing Crisis"".  If you are in a situation where in order for you to get well, you have to completely kick over the traces & start over fresh with what you're doing to more effectively manage your health care - Reiki can pull out the stops for you & cause this to happen.  Remember The Chariot in the tarot, The Tower, & Judgement...??  In our cases, we had to hurt to heal.  I was forced to face a confrontation & put my foot down to insist on better care, when I was told I wasn't allowed.  We were locked in with people weren't getting us well, & there was no other way but a complete Revolution.  And IMO, Reiki can be a VERY Revolutionary energy...!  : D  If that's what you need to move forward.  It's a good example of how Reiki does not substitute for but works with (or against!) conventional medical care, & your own ingenuity, to bring about your healing.

The ""Healing Crisis"" also motivated me to get moving & finish my training in Reiki & complete the 2nd & 3rd Level Attunements, in order to really get cracking on trying to rebalance & stem the flow of disaster on my own.  This wasn't all the doing of just the Healing Attunement, after about 4 wild weeks of chaos I took things over from there.  It just started the avalanche of change necessary to get the healing process started.  Steve Murray put all of the necessary tools in my hands to do this, & he can put them in yours too.  My friend & I are both doing much better today, & all that's in bad shape now are the egos of a few lousy doctors who lost two patients.  So if you find your condition taking a sudden turn for the worse after a Reiki treatment, take it from me - you may actually finally be getting on the right track to getting well again.  Don't run away like I did at first (lol) - the sky IS falling, but those rain clouds have to fall so that they can get out of your way & you can see where it is you need to go to get well.  I kept working with Reiki for several months until I saw the daylight at the end of the tunnel.  We finally broke through to the other side this year, & we're very grateful to Reiki Master Steve Murray for his training & these Attunement programs.  What a wise investment these were.  Geeze, where would we be without 'em...??  :)

2063272,5,B0002606BA,Outstanding easy to understand and do. It seems to work. I do it everyday. If your into reiki this is a must.,1163030400,,109,4.0
2063273,5,B0002606BA,"Recently while searching for some music, I came across Steve Murray's DVD programs for attunement. First impression was that, this must be fake. As it was in total contradiction to the learning's I learnt during my Reiki 2nd degree in India. I went on to read the reviews and none of the reviews were negative. All people including some Reiki masters were in praises for Steve's program. I took the chance and ordered his first book, 1st cd and DVD attunement for 2nd degree. I wanted to take this again for reinforcement and to give my wife 2nd degree who was a 1st degree. (My intention was to try his claim first before I venture into a master attunement of Reiki through DVD)

 Last week I received the dvd and the first thing was to play the dvd to see myself, if it works. It did work. It was a very powerful attunement & I received it all through a DVD, isn't it amazing.. Immediately after that my wife took the attunement and she also felt extreme heat and tingling sensation. Now she is a 2nd degree and her Reiki is flowing beautifully. The first line of his book, which says ""I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now"". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. When I played his attunement cd part 1, I felt a gentle shower of Reiki all over me. Its playing right now and I can feel Reiki all around me. Since then I have taken both 1st & 2nd degree attunements a couple of times and every time I feel an increase in my energy levels. I feel my hearing ability has increased; now I can pick up sounds quite far from me. My smelling ability has increased, my concentration and consciousness has increased too.

 Giving attunements like this proves that Reiki works in past present and future all layered together. This even supports the string theory proposed by Einstein and the 11 dimensions we live in. probably Reiki works in all those 11 dimensions just by our intent. Steve has done a great think to mankind by his video programs. He is in fact a time traveler who travels forward and backwards in time by his Reiki and gives the attunement to us whenever we watch his videos and listen to his cds. His attunements on Dvd cost just 30 whereas taking a master attunement cost $1,000 in India and up to $10,000 in US. He has made Reiki available to the masses virtually at no cost. This way more and more people can use this power and be healed and heal others. Reiki is a free gift from the supreme power and should be available for masses. I honor his Reiki mission which is to spread Reiki to everybody for their betterment.

I also ordered his subliminal programs; currently I am using Quit Smoking and Stress relief. Only 3 days have passed doing these programs. I already feel that my stress levels are going down. The second day I lit the cigarette but I couldn't pull, I felt as if the smoke is killing me. Immediate reaction was to throw the cigarette and now I don't feel like smoking anymore, touchwood. Next weekend I will be taking my master level attunement and I feel so happy about it.

I recommend the entire set of dvd's and books by steve to everyone who is on a sprititual or just healing journey. Once you use these products with a open mind, your life will never be the same again

I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try ""Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)"" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being. From there it will depend on your fate and your karma. But at least let your body experience it once. I can bet that this might be the best investment you can ever make in your entire life.",1160438400,5,4167,4.334615384615384
2063274,5,B0002606BA,"As a newcomer to Reiki, I like the idea that Steve Murray is a hypno-therapist and uses scientific knowledge to heal the mind but also has a spiritual connection with reiki and has combined the two in his quest to help people grow spiritually, mentally and emotionally. It takes away the ""voodoo edge"" and gives me a feeling of security when working with mind/body/soul issues for myself and others. Within a few days after using the master attunement DVD, my third eye opened up and started pulsating and soon after the center of my palms were ""buzzing"" too.",1151280000,4,559,4.714285714285714
2063275,5,B0002606BA,"I came upon Steve Murray's DVDs and books after more than 15 years of meditation and self-discovery.  There was revealed a whole new world to me through Reiki. Steve talks and walks us through each step, so that anyone can receive his Attunements with ease.  My wife and I both use Steve's Healing Attunement (we bought all 5 Reiki DVDs) every week, simply because IT WORKS on any issue; mental, physical, emotional. It's great to know that my family and I can use this over and over for any issue - old or new.  And we do!!  Moreover, I have had an intense interest in healing for quite some time.  Following the Reiki Level 1 Attunement, I felt a mild yet powerful energy as I was channeling (or giving) Reiki to my wife while she was in labor just a few days later. She tells me that her pain was greatly diminished and she did have the baby quite easily for a very petite woman. Unbelievable!  Then I ordered the Reiki Level 2 and Reiki Master Attunements just days after that and have been channeling Reiki to my wife, newborn girl and myself.  After having taken the Reiki Psychic Attunement a couple of times, I began to notice that ideas and answers were coming to me out of nowhere concerning all areas of my life, and this increases noticeably after every Attunement now. It's like supercharging your sixth-sense! The increase in my everyday awareness that I have experienced is distinct and plainly recognizable, as well as the wonderful and rewarding ability to contact angels and my spirit guides. I cannot say enough about this incredible DVD from Steve Murray.  I recommend ALL of Steve Murray's DVDs, which have changed my life - literally improving my quality of life, as well as that of my family and friends!",1149984000,5,1727,4.602605863192182
2063276,4,B0002606BA,"Just to add... I am a massage therapist for about four years &  also have taken two Reiki classes I & II.
I wasn't blown away from it... but by concentrating on what I need to work on in my life & concentrating on that & nothing else with very little distraction & letting my thoughts get away is part of how the attunement works.
As soon as the video showed a dry beautiful landscape, I knew it was Sedona, Arizona where many people have said they felt increased energy & unusual things.
The DVD itself is only about 4 min of introduction & 20 min of attunement which is staring at a crystal in Sedone on a large rock & the video is actaully paused. Considering, I didn't expect much, but towards the end, I noticed I could concentrate better & did feel more energy & felt more calm, balanced & relaxed afterwards.
To be fair, I didn't feel that much difference after my attunements in my Reiki class themselves, but my abilities increased dramatically, though subtely over the next months.
As he says & I also felt the same during my massage sessions...  The past, present & future is all one moment, so the quality of the DVD isn't important, it's the intentions behind them of the people who make it & how you feel towards them as well.
He also has subliminal Pain Relief & Fear & Stress Relief DVDs. Maybe he uses subliminal here as well? If it's just a placebo effect... Hey, if it helps, who cares how it came to be.",1138320000,19,1423,4.325842696629214

After viewing it several times, many old wounds from an abused childhood, two rapes, an abusive marriage and sexual harrasment at several jobs in the past, started healing my body and mind from holding much pain and illness. I have also found Steve Murrays CD, Reiki Healing Music Attunement Vol. 1 and 2 to be very helpful, along with his book Reiki the Ultimate Guide. Every day after viewing this DVD I feel things quietly changing for the better in me. I seem to intuitively know what my body needs and I am beginning to feel better than I have in many years, in fact my life. I don't normally mention my past but if there is anyone else, who might benefit from my saying this then I am glad to. Please do yourself a favor, get the DVD and if you can the CD's and book also, the really have helped me.",1125187200,,877,4.25748502994012
2063281,5,B0002606BA,"I've completed the Reiki Master Attunement and would recommend the entire series of dvds to anyone. I'm sure the books are great as well as I've just ordered Volume 1 and 2 today. This particular video is extremely special to me and was my third. (I chose to do the Psychic first and 1st level second. Btw, whatever order you do is fine as long as you don't do the first, second and third in any order but that--you can put Psychic and this one-Healing in there as you like.) I recommend this one and/or the Psychic one for those who want healing but don't necessarily desire to become Reiki healers themselves. I don't know why anyone wouldn't want to be a healer but I am sure they are some people who just want to heal themselves for now. (Let's face it, we need healing for ourself before we can help anyone else anyway!)

I've watched this particular video at least three times now and it is my Favorite because I focus on what I want healed in my life as I receive the atttunement. I enjoy that because it, to me, feels very powerful when you set your own intent.  Note that this is for Everyone, those who are attuned to any level or not attuned.  I've had so many wonderful experiences during this video, the one I remember most is walking barefoot on the golf course late at night near my home and smelling honeysuckle so strongly as if I were in a paradise garden of ""honeysuckle heaven.""  I looked around thinking they must have planted more but there was just this one bush like always.  Obviously my senses were heightened due to the treatment.  I've never smelt anything so beautiful and powerful in my life before or since.  What makes it all the more astounding is I have allergies and usually am so congested that I can hardly can smell anything at all but not that night! [Actually my allergies have greatly diminished since attunements...] Wow! The scent was so strong and intoxicating yet not overbearingly so that I will Never forget the memory of that night.

Another thing I'd like to mention is: Steve says that no belief/religion is required to use Reiki.  I just want to point out that it Doesn't mean if you DO have faith that you can not use it.  I am a Christian and use Reiki combined with prayer keeping in mind all the time that God is the Source and the Healer and I am just the channel He works through to the people I treat with Reiki.  Reiki is just another door for God to work in my life and I keep All doors ""open"" to Him.  I recommend Reiki for any and everyone that is wanting to tap into the Source of all things...get ready for incredible things to happen in your life! Yet remember that Reiki always works for the greatest good  to heal what is Most needed in your life, not necessarily what you want.  So just be honest with yourself when using this video and you will surely have the wondrous results that will shock you.  God bless you on your journey.  And thank you and God bless you Steve, for making the process of healing simple and affordable to all.  I agree that there should be no secrets in healing.  o8E

2063282,5,B0002606BA,"Just know that this is only an attunement. This does not go into details of Reiki. It's great that you can play this over and over and get reattuned. Was hoping that it offered more than what it did.

I suggest you buy it used then loan it to all your friends (for free).",1094515200,5,271,4.018518518518518
2063283,5,B0002606BA,"I have now purchased Steve Murray's... ""Reiki Healing Attunement"", ""Reiki 1st Level Attunements"", ""Reiki 2nd Level"" and ""Master Attunement"".
I was very impressed with the healing energy that comes forth through these much needed DVD'S of Reiki attunements.

However, if you are looking for information on the history of Reiki, you will not find it here. There are many wonderful books out there for that kind of knowledge, but if you are truly interested in receiving Reiki attunements then these are the DVD's I recommend.  If you are wanting attunements to be able to heal yourself, others and this beautiful world we live in, then Steve's DVD's are for you.

I was blown away by the love I felt and the flow of positive energy.  The attunements are powerful!  I am so eternally thankful someone stepped outside their comfort zone and made Reiki attunements available at such an affordable price.  Reiki is needed now more than ever.  This is truly healing for the now and the future.

If you are interested in making a positive difference in yourself, and others, I urge you to get these Reiki attunements. And don't let people tell you that to be able to receive attunements you have to do it in secret, and it has to cost a lot of money.  Reiki energy is a gift from God and is a free, loving energy to anyone that has a desire for healing.

I thank Steve for having a vision for the betterment of everyone!

This will honor you where you are, and inspire you to go beyond your impossibilities!",1083110400,38,1499,4.618867924528302

The Reiki Master Attunement DVD gave me a true attunement, enhancing my healing abilities. Steve's books, Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Ultimate Guide Vol 2, Ultimate Guide Vol 3, Ultimate Guide Vol 4, and Reiki Beliefs Exposed For All are fabulous and filled with a wealth of information. His DVD, A Reiki 1st, Aura and Chakra Attunement Preformed, is an excellent companion to the books demonstrating the actual processes of performing attunements.

8022578,5,B0002606BA,"Since my first attunement many years ago, I have been looking for answers about reiki. Even after becoming a reiki master, the questions remained. Either due to secrecy, or they themselves just didn't know. Since I was a young boy I have always wanted to know more about becoming a healer. It seemed with every turn came a hefty price or a brick wall. How does one explain a healing procedure, when your not sure of the answers yourself. It was like having an owners manual with most of the pages missing. Needless to say my reiki practice was limited to animals and close associates. Hey...at least the animals didn't ask questions. lol. After hearing about Steve Murrays Ultimate guides and dvd's, I was skeptical. I did research and found all the wonderful things that was said about him and his reiki guides. My instincts kept telling me to go for it. To take a chance. So, in a bold endeavor for answers, I purchased all 5 volumes of Steve Murrays reiki guides. Plus, his book Reiki False Beliefs Exposed. His 1st, 2nd, and master reiki attunement dvds. Psychic and chakra attunement dvds. And his Animal Psychic Communications book. I'm here to tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made!! From the time I opened the first Ultimate guide. Answers came faster than I could have ever imagined. Through the straight forward and concise information in these materials, I have a renewed confidence. With the first book, I have learned more in one sitting than I had in several years of questioning. With his psychic, healing, and chakra attunements, I have actually seen profound results in a short amount of time. Steve Murrays Reiki False Beliefs Exposed was very in depth. Really cleared the air on the reality of reiki. As for his Animal Psychic Communications book. It has helped tremendously between myself and my horses, and pets. A special thank you goes to Steve Murray for his outstanding work.",1254441600,,1924,4.746268656716418
8022579,5,B0002606BA,I am working on my master's in mental health counseling. I will be using methods like meditation and Reiki in my practice. In the past people marketed Transcendental Meditation (TM) to make large sums of money. The concept of meditation was good but using it to bilk large sums of money from others was just wrong. Reiki is at a crossroads. People must decide if it is to be used just as a money making scheme or for the betterment of mankind. The concept of Reiki works. It has helped many people. But like TM some see Reiki as a way to make large sums of money off others. Steve Murray has taken Reiki and made it available to everyone at a fair price. His books and tapes work.

8022580,2,B0002606BA,"Personally,, I found this video to be a little (rather a lot)  disappointing. The video did not attempt provide any background history, understanding, or explanations of the Reiki Attunement process, symbols, or training. Also, since the primay focus (instrument) used in the Attunement Process was a large Crystal Quartz Stone, the fact that the ""stone"" brilliance, color, and character was entirly loss (not captured) in the video made the video worthless, in my opinion. The Videographer failed miserably in capturing the stones quality or natural color, brilliance, or character. Instead it appeared as a discolored rock of little significance.

I think Steve Murray missed the mark with this video, as it was ""too little value"" for the cost. Next time, I hope he finds a better cameraman or videographer for the shoot. He should and could also provide more background on the Reiki Attunement process and purpose.",1231891200,3,917,5.2312925170068025
8022581,5,B0002606BA,"I like Steve Murray's books and DVD's because they are written by a man who truly believes in Reiki and what Reiki can do for everyone. Steve's introduction is quite honest and I know of others who share this philosophy and dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.

What these books and DVD's can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements both receiving and giving. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements.  As for the complaints for not having the traditional hand placements he clearly states the philosophy behind his reasons to give treatment to specific places of the body and why.  This made sense to me and as I know every practitioner is not the same.  Getting the traditional placements online is easy.

I also felt the attunement dvd's or video's Steve Murray has available are amazing. They are wonderful, life altering, and being absolutely blessed experience. Reiki is for everyone willing to learn and he provides it.  Thanks for not coloring inside the lines.
