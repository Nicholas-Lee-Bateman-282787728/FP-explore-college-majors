Nevertheless, I love the whole atmosphere of the  film, right down to the inconsistent accents.  The romance is great and I love its portayal of the way corruption can creep up on a person./",966902400,,285,4.339622641509434
997954,3,6305262241,"There is one version of this film which puts near-contemporary 'Body Heat' to shame for plotting, action and the amazing sensual rapport between the two main players.
Sadly, this DVD version has about ten minutes of cuts,  compared to the full version.
There really is no excuse for this; since  one of the main selling points of the DVD format has been that it includes  material excised from (some) theatrical and video release versions.
We  did it for 'Blade Runner'; we can do it here.

997955,5,6305262241,"You are immediately drawn into the undercurrent of what makes N'Awlins tick as you pop this movie into your VCR.  From the instant they appear on screen together, Quaid and Barkin are on fire.  This crime caper definitely  has ""lagniappe"" . . . a little something extra for everyone!  Not  only action, there's the hot romance and humor.  Ned Beatty takes a fine  part in this film as well.  Quaid, as Remy, has ruined me for everything  else he's done since.  I look for Remy every time I return to the Big  Easy!",957139200,,514,4.419354838709677
997956,5,6305262241,a wonderful atmospheric story that will keep your attention all the way through. it is not a routine shoot em up but a story that develops and twists and turns throughout. this coupled with the wonderful soundtrack  some of which is sang by none other than mr quaid himself makes this a film  that you will want to watch again ang again.,947116800,,337,4.419354838709677
997957,4,6305262241,"One of the few movies every shot in New Orlenas that captures the look, the mood and the spirit of New Orleans.

 I saw it at the drivein back in the summer of 1987 and watched it countless times over the years when I caught it on TV. It was worth a buck 99. It's campy and over the top and I'd sit and watch it again just to see Ellen grab the wrong butt!!",1493769600,,424,3.6777777777777776

998862,5,6305262241,"This review is an excerpt from my book Killer Bs: The 237 Best Movies On Video Youve (Probably) Never Seen, which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

THE BIG EASY: When a minor hood is found floating facedown in a fountain, New Orleans police Lieutenant Remy McSwain (Quaid) shrugs it off as a routine wise guy hit. But no-nonsense Assistant District Attorney Anne Osborne (Barkin) demands an investigation, which leads to a clash of attitudes: his, laid-back and loose; hers, repressed and rigid.

Just as his smooth Southern style begins to win her over, hes caught in a bribery sting set up to catch another copan event that endangers his investigation, his career and his relationship. Osbornes reaction forces Remy to question whether he can continue to overlook police corruption and still stay one of the good guysa moral dilemma that escalates when he discovers that the gang war hes investigating might be a red herring covering up the police corruption shes investigating.

Discussion: The Big Easythe local nickname for New Orleansalso nicely describes the attitude of the locals, and Quaid is the embodiment of that style. Smooth as roux, his genuinely endearing attempts to loosen Osborne up become the centerpiece of the film; the plot is merely a convenient device to push them together and pull them apart.

The intriguing plot would have made an excellent movie even without this romantic capstone, but combined with a believable romance, first-rate performances, and an emotional dilemma (reminiscent of the similar work-versus-family theme of The Godfather, Part II), then laced with a touch of humor (like the scene divesting Goodman of his weapons), we end up with a film just as spicy and satisfying as any culinary creation from a Cajun kitchen.",1423180800,,1873,4.97444089456869

999290,3,6305262241,"Corrupt cop is shown why being corrupt for ""good reasons"" is just as bad as the corrupt cops who are corrupt for ""bad reasons"".

While I remember this movie being billed as ""sexy"" they movie was hardly focused on sex or sex appeal. Yes there were the couple of scenes that entertainment mags, entertainment shows, and movie ""critics"" focused on. But the movie was really about the corruption that was (and probably still is) New Orleans, especially its police department. That city has a notorious past, especially its police force. Anyway, the main cop character is OK with corruption as he uses it to get the criminals off the streets and help pay his kid brother's college tuition . . . you know from the ""orphans and widows account"" . . . wink wink . . . which is basically kick backs for looking the other way for places like strip clubs . . . you know . . . harmless stuff. . . again . . . wink wink. Well when the cop gets impacted by the larger cop corruption going on he doesn't think it is that funny. So he and the new female DA team up to clean things up. Shoot outs ensue. People die. Etc.

Again nothing special nothing bad. Just a movie as they should be I guess. I will say that Quaid looks like a different person back then . . . darker . . . skinny . . . fit . . . and his face is somehow . . . slim and even a different shape. Today he has such a huge face and nose even though he is still a fit man. Weird. But it works for the role I guess. He is a good actor. Good New Orleans accent. Ellen Barkin is good but she is a one dimensional actress I think . . . plays the somewhat smart somewhat stupid girl guys want to get in bed . . . but with all the ""respect owed her"" (eye roll).",1385164800,,1702,4.002941176470588

Now to me this was a must have then and even if it is dated now it is still very entertaining.  It is a wonderful testament to New Orleans city and culture pre-Katrina.  I re-watch this every couple years and it is always a pleasure.  A good story about a cop and a district attorney's romance amidst crime and corruption.  So grab some popcorn and friends for a good time on the Bayou.

That morning he meets with Anne Osborne played by Ellen Barkin a beautiful, sexy no-nonsense district attorney investigating allegations that the perpatrators of the murder were police officers. Remy finds himself enthralled by Anne and wants nothing more then to show her a good time and maybe something more, all she wants is to work. But eventually he wears her down and the two start to investigate the murders that are occuring in the New Orleans underworld and it leads to it being a family freind who is behind it and two detectives.

999560,5,6305262241,I generally like any movie that takes place in the Cresent City a.k.a. NOLA. Dennis Quaid has got the accent down. The story of police corruption and the story within a story about family and it's history of police officers carries this movie along. I saw The Big Easy in theaters when it first came out & I enjoy watching it again. The soundtrack also carries the movie well.,1337040000,,376,4.463768115942029
999561,5,6305262241,"The talented and handsome Dennis Quaid plays his finest role to date, as New Orleans detective Remy McSwain.  He's more than a sexy swine, he's on the take too.  This doesn't make him a bad guy, after all, his ""daddy"" and ""grandaddy"" did the same when they were ""on the job"".  The Big Question, does this make him a ""Bad Cop""?  Enter Ellen Barkin, as Assistant DA Anne Osborne, smart, yet naive enough to fall for McSwain's all too obvious charms.  Since she has come to town to investigate police corruption, namely his and his close associates, her innate  weakness for Quaid's temptingly sexy McSwain, will lead to hard choices.  Will her heart, or her reputation on the job rule?  Watch this film and see!

 No matter how many times I've seen this film, I find it tremendously entertaining.  Jim McBride squeezed some of the best performances of all time from  the two leads.  I was amazed when I read that Barkin and Quaid didn't harmonize well off screen, because their love scene is one of the most convincing I've ever seen in film.  Remy McSwain is unforgettably irresistible during  his barechested seduction of ""unlucky in love"" Anne Osborne.  He literally lets her hair down (always in a bun), while touching and kissing her in the most tender and sensual way, then tells her; ""Well cherie, your luck's about to change..."" Indeed!

 This film has a wonderful musical score from Brad Feidel, I love the opening theme, and purchased the soundtrack for it.  Also, the terrific New Orleans atmosphere adds depth and authenticity to the story.  I've been to New Orleans, the French Quarter and Bourbon Street myself, if you haven't, this will give you an excellent vicarious feel of it.  In particular, the scene where Quaid has to sleep on the couch while Barkin is in his bed during a typical summer night thunderstorm, music droning from the street, is a gem.

 Aside from the steamy romance, atmosphere, and score, the plot hooks you as well.  The script is sharp, witty, and peppered with colorful local lingo.  ""The Big Easy"", is a fast paced police action thriller, but with a semi-noir feel that is unique.  The story moves along interestingly throughout, is easy to follow, and builds into a terrific and satisfying resolution.  What more can you ask for?

 Like subsequent police thrillers that have spicy sexual undercurrents, particularly Mike Figgis' ""Internal Affairs"" (see my review) or Paul Verhoeven's ""Basic Instinct"", this film is one to watch with the one you love.  However, the aforementioned love scene between Quaid and Barkin, may cause you  to come back and watch the rest later.  Whatever you do, don't let this unique and sexy adventure pass Bayou.",1021248000,20,2683,4.828571428571428

When she confesses that she's never had much luck with sex and he assures her that her luck's about to change...well, what woman's heart doesn't melt?

It is a dandy ""cop"" film, but the cover says it is  spiced to the gills with New Orleans nightlife, steamy romance  and sultry suspense.  The steamy romance is described as electrically charged attraction [which] keeps the sparks flying.  It is rated R and not for naughty language.  Ellen Barkin's role is tough-girl DA.  She also has a degree in heavy breathing and panting a lot. If you have teen age boys in the family let them watch The Big Easy.

999565,5,6305262241,"It is a shame this movie wasn't a bigger hit--largely because it deprived moviegoers of more cinematic pairings of Dennis Quaid and Ellen Barkin, a couple whose on-screen chemistry approached that of William Powell and Myrna Loy. The sex scenes here are truly steamy, yet used as much to establish character and advance the story as to titillate the audience. Quaid portrays a casually corrupt homicide cop on the New Orleans PD who is forced to rethink his life when (a) Barkin, a DA he's seriously attracted to, refuses to have anything to do with him, and (b) he discovers that the corruption in the department vastly exceeds anything he ever imagined. The movie may be ""Show Me the Money"" at the beginning, but at the end, it's ""Show Me the Remorse."" The plot of a man reformed by the love of a good woman lost popularity as the 20th century progressed, but Quaid, Barkin and director Jim McBride deserve credit for updating it in a fresh, surprising and sexy way.",971049600,47,968,4.666666666666667
