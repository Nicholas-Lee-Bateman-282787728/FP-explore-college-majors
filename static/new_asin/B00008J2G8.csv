7984612,3,B00008J2G8,"No. 13 Demon Street--sounds likes a nice place to visit & maybe I would want to stay. But seriously, folks, is there anything here of note beyond the presence of Lon Chaney as Satan. As far as Satan on the big-screen, what could have more fitting during this time than Mr. Chaney--who, unfortunately at this point in his career was probably getting by more on name value than anything else. Not to say the man couldn't  act anymore, but I'm sure all the serious Lon fans know about the live tv drunk incident that sent his career to B-movie hell.

At any rate, Chaney does make a great Satan (shocker, I know). And that is pretty much the big draw for this film. Satanya is nice to look at, the stories in between Satan's segments passable entertainment & the closing reel is pretty good. Basically this is for the hardcore Chaney purists who will watch pretty much anything the man did--even dreck like ""La Casa Del Terror.""",1513209600,,925,4.532934131736527
7984613,4,B00008J2G8,"Lon Chaney Jr. after playing Wolfman, Dracula. Mummy, Frankenstein, now takes on the Devil...with a Roladex. Satayana (Karen Kadler) a suicide victim has the option of delivering packages to individuals or go to hell. She chooses the packages which give us three film shorts including a 50,000 year old woman frozen in ice with plucked eye brows, mascara, and eye shadow. The very ending was typical of many sci-fi films of the era. Worth a peek if you got an hour. Available on numerous multi-packs.",1474502400,2,500,4.894117647058824

7984616,5,B00008J2G8,"The Alpha DVD of The Devil's Messenger is pretty good with a few minor imperfections.  It's complete and with no Alpha logo.  Episodes of 13 Demon Street can be found on the Image DVD of The Veil, which is recommended.",1267228800,,218,4.425
7984617,5,B00008J2G8,"Lon Chaney, what can I say besides he is a great actor.
 Not sure what year the movie is made in for sure but it is an old black and white movie. The movie has 3 stories in it told by ""the devil"" Lon Chaney Jr. The First story is about a photographer that takes a picture of a woman next to a house. The woman is far away in the picture but every time he looks at the picture the woman gets closer and closer. The next story is about a group that is down in the mines and they come across a woman in ice. One of the men goes crazy over the woman and says that he loves her. The last story is about a man that has a dream that he is in a dark alley and he sees a door and goes inside. There is a Fortune Teller that says that she will kill him at midnite.
 This is a really good old Chaney movie. If you like some of his other movies I think that you will like this one. Pick it up at amazon.",1265587200,,891,3.6596858638743455
7984618,5,B00008J2G8,"This may be a 60s Black and White, but it was way ahead of its time. One could easily call it an excellent forerunner of the ""Devil's Advocate."" The world will probably remember Chaney Jr as the gentle and sympathetic wolf man. But he is a GREAT devil! The movie starts with a young woman (Kadler) who killed herself over lost love. She confronts the devil and he says: ""Love, well, love is such a stupid emotion."" This may sound strange, but think about it! Isn't it stupid to kill yourself over someone who doesn't love you?

Moving on, perhaps seeing her potential, Chaney makes a deal with her that if she does some tasks for him, she could escape the worst parts of hell. (She has to deliver cursed items up to earth.) This leads to 3 separate stories that eventually connect. (The 1st deals with a man sexually obsessed with several women. The 2nd deals with a man who betrays his profession and friends over a woman frozen in ice.)

The signature moment is when Kadler rebukes the devil for messing up people's lives, and he responds: ""Dear, people ruin their own lives."" The devil can tempt and persuade, but we make our own decisions. If we notice, the parties the devil picks out already had problems to begin with.

In an especially chilling moment, Chaney manipulates Kadler's most vulnerable emotion. He offers her a chance to get even with the man who rejected her. Needless to say, Kadler gets more enthusiastic about her work. The 3rd story deviates from the standard formula and focuses on revenge more than anything. (Kadler's x lover is not really a bad person, and we really have no reason to dislike him.) One could even defend his act of murder in that a reasonable person would have felt threatened. But the 3rd story does compensate with fear, suspense, and tragic irony.

Another reason I consider this a masterpiece ahead of its time is because while some movies glorify war, this movie seems to emphasize that war is hell on earth. And while suicide over love is a common thing, we have an interesting conversation that could occur between the parties: ""I'm not in love with her, and I haven't been for a long time!"" In one brief moment, we see how stupid suicide over love is.

Between the great acting, the scenery, the scary stories, the memorable themes, and the sudden unification of 3 great stories, this movie is a masterpiece of horror!",1213142400,3,2371,4.622327790973872
7984619,2,B00008J2G8,"If you have three lemons, you might as well try to make lemonade - but there's no guarantee it's going to taste very good.  That pretty much sums up The Devil's Messenger.  I'm a little iffy on the history here, but apparently Curt Siodmak (the man who wrote The Wolf Man and Donovan's Brain, as well as a string of complete flops) put together a horror show (filmed in Sweden) called 13 Demon Street around 1960 or so.  Apparently, no one was the least bit interested in the show, so it died in relative obscurity.  Having watched The Devil's Messenger, which incorporates three of the show's 13 episodes, it's not hard to see why no one wanted to take a chance on such drivel.  The only interesting thing about this production is its host, Lon Chaney, Jr. (looking old before his time).  Chaney is the gatekeeper of Hell; equipped with his infernal Rolodex, he sends all the new recruits through the door to get what they deserve (which seems to involve listening to silly evil laughter).  Suicides are special cases, though, because they supposedly hurt only themselves and not others.  When a third-time's-the-charm suicide victim by the name of Satanya arrives, he cuts her a deal.  All she has to do is make three deliveries for him back up on Earth, and she might have a chance at getting her Hell Express ticket voided.

Satanya first delivers a camera to an obnoxious, womanizing photographer who is soon haunted by a photograph that seems to be very much alive.  Satanya returns, whines about having to do such awful things as delivering cameras, and is sent back up with a pickaxe for a certain Swedish miner.  That pickaxe soon leads to the discovery of a 50,000 year old woman encased in ice.  An anthropologist with the buggiest eyes I've ever seen then goes completely cuckoo for Cocoa puffs over the young lass.  This is really a stupid episode.  Finally, Satanya gets an assignment that gives her a chance to get some revenge on the guy she killed herself over.  Haunted by a recurring nightmare, this fellow goes to the location in his dream and watches everything he dreamed come true - yada yada yada.  There's not an ounce of originality in this or either of the earlier little episodes - and the twist at the end isn't anything to write home about, either.  If you're not a Lon Chaney, Jr., fan, I can assure you there's really no reason in the world for you to watch The Devil's Messenger.",1131408000,,2412,4.608899297423887
7984620,3,B00008J2G8,"Lon Chaney jr. plays the devil in this 3 part horror anthology. He gives one of his female lost souls a chance to be his assistant on earth. Her name is ""Satanya"" and she delivers various key items to the main characters in each story. The first one involves a psycho photographer, who takes a picture of a strange girl before murdering her. Let's just say that she is not happy! She haunts the man in a unique way. In the second story (the weakest of the three), a girl is found underground, frozen in ice. An anthropologist falls in love with her and kills one of his colleagues for trying to study her. He then defrosts his ""girlfriend"" and a strange surprise awaits him. The final story is about a man who dreams of being on a dark street and entering a door. His psychologist convinces him to actually visit the place. When he does, he runs into a fortune teller who tells him that she will kill him by midnight. This is the best of the trilogy, and has a cool twist ending. All in all a fair production. Lon is wasted in my opinion. He defintely had better days...",1056758400,3,1070,4.301980198019802
7984621,5,B00008J2G8,"It is hard to resist the Alpha Video titles with their great cover art and low prices even after buying some of their early releases that were of such poor quality.  However, the quality of their recent releases is improving dramatically.  The Devil's Messenger fits into that category.
The Devil's Messenger is actually just 3 episodes of an unreleased TV series filmed in Sweden called ""13 Demon Street.""  Curt Siodmak wrote and directed the series but was unable to find a US distributer.  No company ever wants to see their celluloid go to waste, so 3 of the best episodes of the series were linked together using Lon Chaney as the Devil to form the Devil's Messenger.
A woman has committed suicide and meets up with the Devil (Chaney) at the gates of Hades.  He offers her a deal if she will deliver 3 messages to the surface.  This is how the three episodes are introduced.  I won't spoil the stories.  While this is no classic, it is nice to see Chaney and the transfer is quite good.  Plus, you just can't beat the price and DVD cover art.  I hope Alpha continues to release these obscure titles for genre fans.",1052524800,4,1119,4.522388059701493
