4525889,5,B0051S3BNO,"This is an absolutely excellent series, right up there with ""Prime Suspect"" with Helen Mirren or ""Vera"". If you're a fan of British Mysteries, you'll love it. The Brits seem to make their female leads very real, less glitzy and yet very appealing.  I watched this series years ago on PBS and was thrilled to see it back. There are only two sets available on Amazon as yet but hopefully there'll be more as it's been on PBS again recently. NOTE: There's a newer version out which I have not yet seen so I can't comment on it.",1444262400,6,524,4.346938775510204

4525891,3,B0051S3BNO,"""Silent Witness Series Two,"" is an outstanding British mystery television series, produced by the British Broadcasting Company in association with the American Arts and Entertainment network. It stars Amanda Burton, who was voted the most popular TV actress in Britain for this show in 2001, was nominated again for this award in 2003, and was nominated for the IFTA Award for Best Actress in a TV show, again for ""Silent Witness,"" in 2004. It is a police procedural, and was an original creation by Nigel McCrery, who also wrote some of the strongest episodes; debuted in Britain on February 21, 1996, and is filmed on location in Cambridge, and Cambridgeshire. The set consists of two DVDs, each of them containing two episodes, for approximately 379 minutes; there are also subtitles, though the cast speaks the Queen's English fairly clearly and isn't generally difficult to follow.

Amanda Burton (The Helen West Casebook ) stars as Dr. Sam Ryan, crusading forensic pathologist. She's ably supported by William Armstrong (Capital City - The Complete Series ) as Dr. Trevor Stewart, and Sam Parks (""Jurassic Park"") as Fred, at the forensics laboratory. The Ryan family is represented by Ruth McCabe (My Left Foot, The Snapper ) as Sam's sister Wyn . Unfortunately, for reasons unknown to me, perhaps budgetary, half the outstanding members of the supporting cast are gone. Sam's family, which provided much of the drama in the first series, is now represented only by Wyn; Dr. Stewart's wife is gone, and we were left wondering for a while as to what had happened to his baby; and the cop shop, also a source of great drama in the first series, has been decimated. It is now headed by the blandly handsome Mick Ford (How to Get Ahead In Advertising ), who plays Detective Superintendent Peter Ross, and does double duty as Sam's beau; and Nicola Redmond (The Phoenix and the Carpet) as D.I. Rachel Selway: her looks are more interesting than she is as an actor. There are also fewer strong guest stars.

Amanda Burton was born and raised in a Protestant area of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and the Ryan family had been given an appropriate, riveting backstory. They too are from Protestant Northern Ireland, and Ryan pere, a high-ranking Protestant policeman, was murdered one morning, in front of his family; the Irish Republican Army had rigged his Land Rover to explode at ignition. We're informed that this has had some pretty drastic effects upon them, as you might expect; depriving sister Wyn, an intelligent woman, of the will and resources to make a meaningful career for herself; and causing Sam to take up the study of the dead, rather than the living. (Mind you, Sam's mother, father - previously seen in flashback--and irritating nephew Ricky have disappeared in this series.) At any rate, Sam is now rather obsessive about her work, too, presumably as the result of her father's death; to her, ""a dead body isn't a person. It's a puzzle. A story - with a beginning, a middle and an end."" We therefore sometimes find her exceeding her brief, conducting her own enquiries outside the lab, interviewing witnesses, and generally making things sticky for the cops she's got to work with.

We continue to see a lot of blood and guts on this show, so be forewarned if that sort of thing will bother you: the show's packaging itself warns of strong forensic detail and bloody violence. The mysteries in this set telegraph their villains, but they do continue to be interesting to watch, reasonably original, and female-oriented. They are:
 ""Blood, Sweat and Tears."" An apparently fit and healthy young boxer dies in the ring: Sam's suspicions are aroused.
 ""Cease Upon The Midnight."" Sam's postmortem upon the body of Stuart Evans reveals a suspicious needle track on his foot. He was too ill with AIDS to have administered this to himself, so who did? Who would?
 ""Only the Lonely."" A young woman is found strangled with her own tights. Ross would love to connect this case to an older, unsolved one: Sam isn't so sure.
 ""Friends Like These."" The body is found of an older woman who was frequently seen walking her dog. Ross and Sam disagree about this one.

This second series isn't nearly up to the first, but it is still of reasonably high quality, and eminently watchable.",1435968000,4,4290,4.867123287671233
