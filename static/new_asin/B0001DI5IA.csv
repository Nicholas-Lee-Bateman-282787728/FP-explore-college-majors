Ronald Spector in his book ""In the Ruins of Empire"" is the first book I have read that talks about this campaign. His account starts on page 27 and goes on for some pages.

It was very impressive to learn of the foresight and detailed planning of the Soviets in their preparations for the campaign. I was astounded by the amount of material and men that were transported THOUSANDS OF MILES from Germany and the Balkans to the Mongolian/Manchurian plains. Really astounding.

Also on this DVD is a film by the American film director Frank Capra titled, ""Prelude To War 1942"". Although I have read much about Admiral Yamamoto  and seen many still photos of him, I had never seen actual film of him speaking. This is included in the Capra film piece.

All and all a very informative DVD.",1518825600,,923,4.575757575757576
8010573,5,B0001DI5IA,"This documentary is almost 90 minutes long and is exceptionally well done! It covers the history of the Japanese presence in Manchuria and China generally, the friction between the Soviets and the Japanese during the 1930s, the operational dogmas of the two opponents, and then moves to the August 1945 blitzkrieg campaign that smashed the Kwantung Army. It contains every important detail - the long Soviet planning, the massive transfer of forces from Europe to the Far East during the summer of 1945, the top commanders, the main weapons, the orders of battle, and the plans of each side, as well as the geography of the Manchuria region which is as big as the whole of Western Europe! The campaing is well analysed with the help of many dramatic scenes and color maps. A worthy addition to the visual library of every World War II fan!",1462665600,,839,4.7534246575342465
