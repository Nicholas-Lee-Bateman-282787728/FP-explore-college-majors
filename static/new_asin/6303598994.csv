7853651,5,6303598994,"I grew up in a home where God came first and foremost as He should.  If biblical values offend you, I'll let you know straight up that this isn't for you- for the same reasons Para-Norman wasn't for me (would love to have had the same courteous warning about that one).  However, if you are in the search for good family films to raise your kids on that are also enjoyable, teach good biblical values, morals, lessons, etc, then this movie absolutely begs to be in your library.  It is a fun, sweet film that I grew up with and watched every year around the fall season leading up to Christmas, usually multiple times.  It bestowes the delightful, warm feeling that one would come to expect from being in a setting like- just before dusk in a beautiful little wood mountain cottage, in a big cosy chair next to a fireplace sipping hot chocolate while watching the snow fall outside through the windows next to a big beautiful twinkling Christmas tree with a loved one (or few) present.  You can fully expect your children, and maybe even yourself, to pick up a few Christmas story bible verses as they watch entranced as the girls explain to Bu the meaning of Christmas from a Christian point of view.  I am truly sorry if you missed out on this as a kid I really am, but its never too late, especially if you have little ones of your own.  Share the joy of this movie with them.  It will ALWAYS be in my collection.  My only regret is that (as far as I know, and I've looked!!) there are no other troll prince movies like it or that it wasn't 20+ mins longer, but its perfect like it is.  Its a masterpiece family feature, 5 stars, all day long.  If you enjoy this you may also want to look into ""McGee and Me"" and ""Adventures in Odyssey.""  They are both series' family focused, high quality and entertainment value and Christian.  Those and this movie were my favorites and I watched them all over and over as a kid.",1444262400,,1918,4.353932584269663

7853653,5,6303598994,"I too grew up watching this film and have recently ordered it for my own family. I am not an ignorant Christian nor do I intend to raise my children as such. It is interesting to me that those who decry intolerance the loudest are often the most offensive people to those around them. I never associated, nor do I now, the evil trolls with Jews. I cannot see the connection. I believe the evil trolls represent all humanity in its fallen state. The Christian children are showing the difference between those who are lost and those who find Jesus--the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Jesus was a Jew and did live in the Jewish culture, but more importantly, Jesus was the God of the Jews. If you're not against Jesus, then how are you for Him? If you don't believe that He is Lord, then you have to believe that He was either a pathalogical liar or insane.

This is a great movie for kids and families to add to their holiday viewing. I hope that you use it for good--to teach others about the Love of God.

And I hope that the bitter reviewer on here can find that love of God and let go of the bitterness. In the meantime, perhaps you could work on writing reviews that are helpful rather than pejorative.",1104796800,8,1205,4.3039647577092515
7853654,5,6303598994,"This little movie should be seen by all, both young and old.

It has a wonderful message about love for self, others, and God.

A must see - good anytime of year!",1102636800,6,162,4.03125
7853655,4,6303598994,"I grew up watching The Little Troll Prince on an old taped-from-tv copy every Christmas season.  It is an enjoyable, though of course at times simplistic and sappy family movie, but being geared toward children, must be.  The story is cute--about a Troll prince who does not fit in with the normal troll ways and discovers that there are other ways to live that are good.  The message is the gospel story of Christ's birth and redemption for humans told in a cute story without being too much for kids to understand, or butchering human truths.  Kids can appreciate and respond to such parts as the young trolls tormenting one another, especially the trolls that are ""different"" or easy targets, much like school children who are deliberately mean to one another.  In response to an ealier, prejudice against Christianity review, there is no anti-semitism in the movie, and growing up with it I can testify to no confusion regarding Jewish people or culture.  After all, Christ was a Jew, and as the characters in the story point out, He came to save all people.  It is a safe and enjoyable holiday movie without watering down the meaning of Christmas to a stupid ""be nice to people and be of good cheer"" concept that is becoming universal and drowning out purpose for the holiday, which is, of course, Christian--Christ's Mass.  If you do not want Christ in Christmas, then perhaps Christmas is not a good holiday for you.  If you want a decent Christmas movie for your kids or family, this is a good choice.",1071360000,17,1509,4.6856060606060606
