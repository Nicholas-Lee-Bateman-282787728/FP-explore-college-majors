7695718,1,B01D01K5AU,"One of the worst movies I've seen.. The acting is just awful (the acting in Alice in Murderland is fairly good compared to this movie.. Different genre I know, but they're both low budget movies) to the point of being irritating; there were no original ideas in this movies whatsoever.

(possible spoiler) reports of people being abducted, then when the aliens come back, they act zombie-like and attack people. Not even much action in this movie, There was one or two parts that were just funny (like the fight scene early on). But be sure to avoid this.",1469145600,,555,4.663265306122449

But having said that, its so bad that is funny, from the cheesy sets, God awful dialogue, and even worse special effects, i just simply got a good chuckle. It looked like a high school production. But i have too ask, how could a movie of this low quality and standards make it into Amazon? Oh well, for the movie purists, stay away from this thing, but if you want to have a good laugh and really don't mind wasting a couple of hours from your life, or burn away a few brain cells, then go ahead and give this a try.. like somebody said, this is ""special kind of trash"" ha ha",1525305600,,659,4.116279069767442

Utter crap you might as well stick your face in a fan than watch this crap it's so cheap and crappy they used nobody's to make it cause real actors would never shame themselves making this.

7695746,1,B01D01K5AU,"The only reason I didn't ditch this mess after 15 minutes is I think its dishonest to review a movie without watching (or in this case, enduring) the whole thing. If you like bad acting, high-school level dialog, substandard sound, ten-year-old CGI, excessive stock footage, overwrought music, and lesbians sucking face this movie is for you.  Otherwise, save a eighty two minutes of your life and pass it by.

 I won't bother to discuss the plot because there isn't any, unless you consider an endless stream of clichs a story line. Its impossible to understand how movies like this can even get made.

Kept wondering when Leslie Nelson was going to appear. This movie has bad everything. I mean bad lighting, bad filming, bad special effects (pfuuuff), bad acting. Not one person in this movie could act. Bad dialogue, part  of the bad acting ,of course. Bad story, just plain stupid. I could go on and on.

The rest of the movie looks like something shot by a bunch of teenage film students around their neighborhood on a Saturday afternoon with their parents volunteering for the adult roles. I am not even kidding. That is the most accurate description of this movie. It is a terrible movie but the one good thing I did get out of this, is that I now found another ideal movie for drinking night with my buddies.

Well, I will never get that hour and a half back, but I still was entertained - not because I liked the movie, but because I kept asking myself why I was still watching it - yet didn't close the window until the movie ended.

8754551,1,B01D01K5AU,Have you ever used the first version of Microsoft Flight Simulator from like 1980?  Needless to say that any review that begins with that comparison is probably not gonna be good. I thought I was watching a cartoon and a pretty bad one at that. But if your drunk or shrooming it'll make you laugh and that's something positive,1530316800,,326,4.52542372881356
8754552,1,B01D01K5AU,I made this movie in my garage on a $92 budget with a few family members and the only friends I have. The script was eaten once by my dog even though we didn't recover it from his front end if you know what I mean. I cant be leave Amazon is so desperate for free movies that they put it on. Oh well I got paid lol SUCKERS!!!! However I have to give it the honest rating that it deserves because it sucks hard core. This is what you get for legalizing pot. Shame on you! now pass the Twinkies.,1529884800,,492,3.881188118811881
