8033415,3,B0002VYPP8,"I mean the story is full of holes, but all in all the adventures the 'young master' encounters are fun, sexy and really quite humorous!  Having seen the original Japanese (non-TV) version this is much lighter on the sexual aspect of the story and more romance oriented... if ever you get a chance... and you have gotten 'Verite' see if you can find the original 'Hanaukyo Maids Tai'... it is not a kids item but you will laugh your head off!",1146268800,4,441,4.444444444444445

8033417,5,B0002VYPP8,"After the death of his mother Taro went to Tokyo to meet his grandfather, the head of the clan.  What ends up happening is now he is head of the clan, in charge of all the wealth and power that goes along with it.  As well as the hundreds of beautiful, and loyal, maids who help run the estate.  So if you like maids who do everything from cook for you, bathe you, dress you, guard you and keep you warm at night, this is the anime for you!

Tons of fanservice in the form of nudity and sexual humor.  Some touching, semi-serious, moments but don't worry - most of it would make Benny Hill proud.  Starring the English voices of Wendee Lee, Sandy Fox and Reba West.  Not much in the way of extras, but with four fun filled episodes it more then makes up for it.  My disc also came with a cool postcard.  For 16 years and up.",1108684800,,824,4.068322981366459
8033418,4,B0002VYPP8,"The more I read Charles Solomon's anime reviews, the more I realize he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about.  Taro is not 8 years old.  It's never mentioned in the show, but it says plain as day on the back of the DVD case that Taro is a 3rd year middle school student.  For those of us who can count, that ought to be about 8th grade and 13 to 14 years of age.  And for most normal males, that's not pre-pubescent.

Now, on to the show.  It's quite funny at times, though a little predictable.  FYI:  there's a lot of nudity in the first episode.  Everything after that is very tame.",1106092800,8,591,4.114035087719298
8033419,5,B0002VYPP8,"I have seen a subbed version of this disc.  The translation was a bit too Japanese to allow complete comprehension, but what I saw was intriguing.

The series appears to be a cross between Love Hina and DNA2.  The main character, Taro, is a schoolboy (15?) who inherits a large estate with thousands of maids.  The maids are so conscientious they end up over servicing, insisting on helping him bathe, go to the toilet and so on.  They get pouty when he refuses their help.

Unfortunately, Taro is alergic to women, etc.

If that was all there was to it I wouldn't recommend it so highly.  But there is a ninja maid, a maid who is a scientific genius and keeps inventing wierd machines (that tend to blow up), an eight year old mute maid with a dark secret, and the teenage head of a rival family who has sworn to destroy Taro but who is also his fiance.  And that was just in the first three episodes.

There are some intersting things going on in the story and I definitely want to see more.",1100908800,6,993,4.318918918918919
