6300490,5,B00IWTCZFO,"Everyone has something they want to keep secret.  Some part of their lives that they would not want others to know about.  Whoever had knowledge of that secret and has the ability to reveal or to conceal it will have power over others.  Gaining control over the mobile phone of a modern, socially-connected person could allow someone access to not only sensitive information, but also to use the device's microphone and camera to spy on that person.  Your phone ""knows"" a lot about you.  Be careful what you put in there, and make sure whatever you put there is not compromised by your apps.  That is the premise of this thoroughly modern suspense thriller from the Netherlands.

Anna (Hannah Hoekstra) is a college student who is majoring in psychology.  She has a lot going on in her life.  In addition to academic demands, she also has to cope with a crippled younger brother, Stijn.  Anna has a close circle of friends and fellow students, who are all connected via their mobile devices.  One day, Anna downloads an App called Iris.  Iris claims itself to be a personal assistant A.I.  At first, the artificial intelligence appears to be useful, responding to Anna's voice instructions.  One day, Iris starts making decisions on its own and rings Anna's phone in the middle of class.  Naturally, the professor confiscates the phone and asks Anna to stop by his office later to pick it up.

In the next scene, we see two phones on the teacher's desk.  One belonging to the teacher, the other to Anna.  Iris activates, presumable using Bluetooth to connect to the other phone.  Anna stops by and retrieves her phone.  IRIS then proceeds to dig into the man's personal life and proceeds to destroy it.

As the plot progresses, Iris starts taking media files from Anna's mobile and distributes them to her social connections.  Private media files.  The kind that could ruin another person's life if made public.  And so the story escalates and our lovely heroine's life becomes a living nightmare.  Anna races across the city, hoping to find the person responsible for the app before more of her friends become victims.

Hannah Hoekstra is very, very beautiful.  Tall, slender, and athletic.  With a naturally beautiful face and blonde hair.  And, oh those sexy eyebrows!.  Her Anna is a slightly tomboyish, motorcycle-riding, spirited girl.  She is very fun to watch.  Hannah Hoekstra is the main reason why I rented this movie from Amazon.  I plan to buy the DVD when it comes out later this year.

The plot itself is not groundbreaking.  I did not download and play with the IRIS app that is part of the movie.  I know nothing about that little extra feature.  Watch this movie primarily to see a fine performance from Ms. Hoekstra.

UPDATE (JULY 23, 2014): I downloaded the IRIS app on a Motorola android mobile phone and watched the movie again.  The IRIS app worked together with the movie playing on the television to provide additional content.  From time to time, additional content will play on the mobile phone's display while the movie is playing.  This could be a different camera angle on the same scene playing on TV, text messages being transmitted by the characters, news flash, and extra scenes.  The ""second screen"" experience did not detract from the enjoyment of the film in any way.  IRIS worked flawlessly, responding to inaudible audio signals coming from the movie to keep itself in sync with the movie.  IRIS is completely optional.  You can fully enjoy the movie without using the app.  But if you have an android mobile or an iPhone, you owe it to yourself to try out the IRIS app and watch this movie.  This is something new and we will probably see more apps like this as movie makers continually look for ways to make their films more of a complete experience.  Mobile phones are now being steadily embraced in higher education, as lessons and course content are being created to integrate mobile devices in the classrooms.  This is a paradigm shift in curriculum design and pedagogy.  It is not a surprise that the movie industry has taken steps to do the same thing.  Highly recommended.",1405123200,,4120,4.764872521246459
6300491,4,B00IWTCZFO,"This movie has an app you download before it starts - the app syncs to the move sound and then does stuff in unison during the movie - wow it was very cool. I would have loved to be in the theater during this move. When we are always told to put our phones away this movie wants everyone to have them out - it was very Cool!!!

some scenes show you one viewpoint on the movie screen and another on your phone at the same time - IF you're a trekkie this movie is def a winner. The plot, as to why the App is on the main protagonist's phone is a little sketchy. But, you're clever, you'll get it. BUT it would have definitely been better had the writers not been in such a hurry - allowing that scene to unfold at something less than hyper speed would have drawn us (the audience) in, discussing the App, its job, and why it does what it does would have been more fulfilling - could have been so much better. Overall its worth the time and effort I had alot of fun experiencing the movie, especially the pone app part - very cool.",1403136000,6,1028,4.064039408866995
6300492,3,B00IWTCZFO,Didn't watch it.  Amazon should disclose language when not in English.  They tell you when a movie is in English but not always when it isn't.,1401408000,,142,4.423076923076923
6300493,4,B00IWTCZFO,"The premise is ridiculous, but the way it unfolds makes it somewhat plausible.  I thought the companion app would be totally cheesy but most of the info on the 2nd screen was very interesting.  I'd like to see more films that use this technology.",1400025600,,246,4.568181818181818
6300494,4,B00IWTCZFO,"the other person wrote about it so i wont, but it was an ok movie, i didn't try running an app with it so i cant comment on that, or if it even worked, but it was interesting enough to keep me watching, if you don't like foreign films with subs then you might wanna skip, personally i don't mind subs.",1399593600,,301,3.9508196721311477
6300495,3,B00IWTCZFO,"Anna Rijnders (Hannah Hoekstra) is a young psychology student and heavy smartphone user. One morning she notices that a strange app is installed on her smartphone. Anna finds the app Iris  one may be reminded of a certain voice assistant  useful at first, but soon learns that Iris could be very nasty, sending compromising videos without her knowing.

It is only natural that Anna decides to uninstall the app. Her attempt only serves to make the situation worse, however, as Iris causes more trouble than before, including possible deaths.

The Dutch thriller App reminded me of Down, a Naomi Watts horror about a man-killing elevator, directed by Dick Maas from the same country. Helmed by Bobby Boermans, App centers on the interesting idea of technology-gone-evil, but the result is only moderately entertaining either as a thriller or satire.

(According to some articles written on the film, App employed the second screen technology when theatrically released, allowing the viewers to download some film-related content on their smartphones.)

Though Hannah Hoekstra is impressive as the hapless heroine trying to stop the app that seems incredibly all-knowing and all-mighty, App is a typical case of one concept stretched thin. App is slick and fast-paced, but lacks the thrill that the original idea could have created.",1398211200,6,1330,5.25
8645856,5,B00IWTCZFO,I found it interesting and intertaining. But I would like to hear some more of Hannah Hoekstra speaking Dutch. She makes Dutch sound so beautiful and sexy.,1444262400,,155,4.777777777777778
8645857,1,B00IWTCZFO,"...and you won't have to subject your eyes and ears to lame writing, vapid characters, unresolved plot points and an utterly absurd concept.

In a nutshell (all spoiler: you'll thank me for it!):
Anna and Sophie are two 20-something best friends and college students. Anna rides a motorcycle. Anna's brother (Stan) is partially paralyzed from a motorcycle accident (although Anna still rides her Honda, wearing a black helmet a la Lisbeth Salander). Anna and Sophie are also taking scuba lessons together. Anna and Sophie go to a party where only the most naive movie watcher on the planet would not realize that Anna's ex (Tim) has installed on her phone an evil app named Iris. Anna is inexplicably failing at least one of her classes. Hilarity ensues as video of Sophie's in flagrante delicto encounter with a professor is released to social media (Sophie forgives her). When another video of a male student's same-sex encounter with another professor, meets the same fate, the professor publicly takes his own life. Anna can't delete the app from her phone. The app can not only transfer content to to other devices its in proximity to, but it can also provide glimpses into the future (but apparently only if those glimpses involve death).

Over time, Iris becomes more powerful. It can take control of SCADA systems, change traffic lights, lock building doors, control elevators. The trail of destruction grows. Anna's sympathetic guy pal: dead. The grey market phone dealer who replaces her malware infected phone (but transfers the SIM card...go figure): dead. Sophie: dead (in a swimming pool scuba-diving accident while the instructor has inexplicably left her underwater in the pool by herself in contravention of the number one rule of any water safety environment).

But wait, there's more. Suddenly we learn that ex-boyfriend Tim is in cahoots with Stan's doctor to implant a device (described to Anna by the doctor as...wait for it...""the implant"") in Stan's spine to let him walk again. Who knew? Not us, until Tim and the doctor start debating the marketing plan for their evil plan that will somehow make both the doctor and boyfriend rich. Naturally, when Anna confronts the doctor about this: more people will die soon. Apparently in The Netherlands, everybody knows everybody.

Anna catches on to their evil plan, disconnects Stan from his post-surgery medical monitoring devices, and then in a rooftop showdown, the doctor and Tim get theirs, courtesy of both Anna and --wait for it-- Iris.

We close with Stan walking normally (what?), on his way to a week Barcelona with Anna on a southbound Boeing 757. The trail of destruction at the hospital is unresolved, including Anna's brutal attack on an innocent bystander nurse.

I'll give you three guesses which app suddenly cackles to life in the glass cockpit of their Spain-bound 757 as the movie ends?

This movie claims to be the first to incorporate the ""Second Screen"" viewer experience, and download an app that will provide additional interaction as the film progresses (but the invitation to do so assures us that you'll have a fine experience without this). Do yourself a favor: this flick is so bad when fed via a single screen, you don't want to add to the experience with a second one.

Avoid.

8645858,3,B00IWTCZFO,Movie is good for what it represents but the interactive part of it .. The U.S. app only works with the English audio if your English speaking and this does not have it had to stream it to get the full experience,1426204800,,212,4.071428571428571
8645859,5,B00IWTCZFO,"I saw this movie on demand a year ago. i synced my iphone app with it. And it was awesome. its watching one movie with two screens. And your phone screen with pop up little info thats inportant to the movie. And screens from different angles. Now watch, american movie directors are going to start copying the idea. they do with everthing else. but App for sure is an awesome movie!!",1424563200,,383,4.408450704225352
8645860,4,B00IWTCZFO,"Definitely catch this one when it becomes available!!

First movie written specifically for viewing with your phone or tablet at your side - makes for a really fun, immersive experience.

Prior to watching the film, you download the free app (I grabbed a screenshot for you, below, as an example), and enjoy the ride :)

In addition, the movie - aside from the novelty of the technology - is well acted, creepy, and will keep you engaged from start to finish.",1423267200,,459,4.6419753086419755
8645861,3,B00IWTCZFO,"This little Dutch creeper is all about an app. We all have them they can be fun, useful, amusing or in the case of this film - deadly.  We meet Anna who is a psychology student, her brother is in hospital with some nasty injuries after a bike accident. Her best friend Sophie is a fun lovin' party girl.

Then one night she goes to an all rocking party where, being young students, anything goes. The following morning, she not only has a hang over but also some new app on her phone - which claims to be a personal assistant and is called `Iris'. It starts off being really helpful, but soon things start to happen; some compromising video is sent, then other peoples' phones seem to start doing things of their own volition, and it all seems to be the fault of the app. Little does she know that this is the sort of app that you can't get rid of and moreover is not good for your health - its like an electronic version of herpes - yeah not nice and more vicious.

This is nearly a really great film. It has a great idea, that of the evil app.  The actors are all very good and the musical score is on a par with excellent. However, we then get some plot holes that are a tad too big to forgive; to say what they are would be a plot spoiler and as they are all part of the main `plot', it kind of loses its charm. If you want a cool and stylish looking film with a bit of `semi horror' thrown in- then this is ok. If you want a seriously well thought out film that could be a nail biting, edge of seat ride (ie: what this could have been) then it is best to avoid. In Dutch with a run time of 80 minutes and some excellent viewing options on the menu set up, this is a film that will not be to everybody's tastes, but if in doubt,  it is worth a punt even as a rental.",1420502400,2,1770,3.9746478873239437
8645862,5,B00IWTCZFO,"When I first got the press release for APP, I was immediately struck by the concept of a second screen film.  In case you're not familiar with the term second screen, it refers to a mobile device used while watching television, especially to access supplementary content or applications (per dictionary.com).  Ive never heard of a movie using this technology, so I was immediately intrigued.  Would it be hokey?  Or would it blow me away?

Im very happy to report the film did the latter.  In addition to a solid plot and intense storyline, APPs second screen application works great, and it adds a whole new level of immersion to the filmgoing experience.

I cant say enough positive things about this film.  The premise is one that could potentially happen someday in the future, therefore there are no issues with realism here.  The acting is top notch, the special effects look good, and theres plenty of tension.  You cant ask for much more out of film.

APP is shot well and looks great from a technical standpoint.  The cinematography is not very noticeable, however this is a good thing; the engaging plot and mystery draws the viewer in so deep, everything else takes a backseat.

The second screen application is the big winner here.  It syncs itself up to the film when you start it, and then it self-activates at specific points during the movie.  In addition to several extras, you also get to enjoy certain scenes from two different perspectives.  This is difficult to explain, as you just have to see it to appreciate it.  Needless to say, it rocks.

APP is a big win for me, and I daresay it is a groundbreaking spectacle that is a must-watch for your post-New Years festivities.  I hope future filmmakers incorporate the second screen tech into their films as well.  But for now, definitely give this one a look.  It hits store shelves after Christmas, on December 30, so make a note.",1418688000,,1901,4.7
8645863,2,B00IWTCZFO,"I like to believe that I'm a fairly intelligent fellow. And I certainly don't need for every nuance and detail of a movie to be explained to me. Unfortunately, I required some explanations that ""APP"" failed to provide.

*SPOILER ALERT*

""APP"" is the story of the download from hell. This application has the ability to predict the future, replay conversations from the past, blow up stores, control elevators, alter traffic lights, and stop heart monitors. I'm serious. Iris (the app) can stop heart monitors. Imbued with these special powers, Iris wrecks havoc on Anna's - the main character - life.

At one point the antagonist mumbles something about the apps ability to 'analyze all probabilities.' I'm guessing that was his explanation for his application's unique gifts. Quite frankly, he didn't sound like he bought it and I didn't buy it either.

Because I couldn't swallow the basic premise, it was hard for me to really enjoy ""APP."" Not to mention, the thrills aren't thrilling, none of the characters act with much urgency including Anna - her urgency peaks and wanes -  and you can see Death coming a mile away.

The one bright spot is that the movie employs this nifty second screen technology which was cool. Overall, though, APP is a weak storyline stretched far too thin. My suggestion? Delete this APP. It didn't work for Anna. But trust me, it will work for you.",1406505600,,1380,4.826271186440678
8645864,4,B00IWTCZFO,"I enjoyed this film.  Quick pace, and just deep enough to get involved with the main character, Anna.  Somewhat suspenseful, but the ending is a predictable.  I couldn't use the app when I first watched the movie because I was on a plane and was using headphones. I watched it again with the app when I was home...pretty neat the way the movie and app sync.  Oh, and you'll never like the name Iris again.",1406419200,,405,4.36
8645865,4,B00IWTCZFO,"Its not only Hollywood that worries about over-powerful machines. This Dutch sci-fi thriller is so closely relevant to the latest digital-tech that after watching it I couldn't help worrying if my iphone has automatically installed some evil APPs. If you love the caring and sexy-voiced Samantha in Her, youll be scared by how vicious Siri-like AI technology can be. Interestingly, the APP in the movie is called Iris, the reverse of Siri.",1405468800,,439,5.111111111111111
