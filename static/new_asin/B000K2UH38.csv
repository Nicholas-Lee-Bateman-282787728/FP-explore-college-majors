8748160,1,B000K2UH38,"The ""insider's"" company GoAntiques is a sham.  I bought two antiques at roughly the same time, from two different sellers, both represented by GoAntiques.

The first was a pair of alledged original Rockwell drawings, signed by the artist. Neither was original and neither was signed. The seller, Roostas Relics, refused to answer phone calls (well, actually he would answer the phone and then set the phone down next to the radio and never come back). His email responses were vicious and threatening.

Eventually, I negotiated a settlement with GoAntiques. This is where the story gets even better. The GoAntiques representative kept stalling until the last possible minute on each round of negotiations (I learned later that this is their favorite tactic -- when you don't respond they get to remove your negative feedback because you ""refused"" to negotiate!). When we did reach a settlement, GoAntiques had me ship the bogus Rockwell's back to the Roostas Relics scammer. After waiting some time for my refund, I again contacted GoAntiques who took the position that the refund was not their responsibility -- it was up to the crook at Roostas Relics to refund my money even though they had negotiated the deal!

The second mistake, which was going on at the same time, was for a set of antique nesting tables in ""excellent condition"" through GoAntiques, from Anita Boyd in Deerfield Beach, Florida, d/b/a Antiques USA. Boyd refused to allow me to arrange shipping, then she refused to send me proof of the shipping cost (which was obviously grossly inflated). To top it off, when the tables arrived they weren't even packed. They had been wrapped in a blanket and shipped to Texas! Well, you guessed it, they were in shambles. Her response to my emails? File a claim with the shipping company. Response from the shipping company? We shipped what she gave us. Resolution? I had to have the tables repaired (which, by the way, had obvious signs of having been repaired previously which means they were not in ""excellent condition"" when she sold them.

Anyway, GoAntiques is a sham. They know that they represent unscrupulous dealers and they don't care. They protect their feedback rating by ""negotiating"" settlements under false pretenses with disatisfied buyers and hope you drop out of the negotiation process so they can remove the feedback anyway.

DO NOT BUY FROM GOANTIQUES !!!!!",1179619200,18,2388,5.017676767676767
