8377358,5,B002PWVW76,"This is one of the very best series from the BBC;  I'm surprised it's not been on PBS.  The marvellous scripts by seven different writers hold one's interest throughout to see the twist at the end.  They're not whodunits;  the twists are the results.  Well-known actors in each of the episodes:  7 episodes in series 1 (2001), 8 in series 2 (2002), and 8 in series 3 (2003)  --  wish there were more.  Five stars aren't enough, I give it ten!!",1421625600,2,443,4.37037037037037
8377359,4,B002PWVW76,"These are understandably of lesser viewing quality than I am used to, because the show was broadcast from 2001 to 2003. Still, they are good enough to hold the interest of a British crime show addict (like me). I bought a cheap, region-free DVD player to play them and have had no problems at all. I will amend this post if something changes.",1400630400,,342,4.444444444444445
8377360,5,B002PWVW76,"I purchased a zone-free DVD player (Samsung, $50) for films such as this.  Every selection is distinguished and memorable, some of England's greatest actors are on hand, and the result is a five star tribute to British film making.  A few of the movies are a bit grim and scary, but that's fine with me.  If you buy a movie with ""murder"" in the title, expect to see a bit of fake blood.  But this set is leagues above the popular ""Midsomer Murders.""  Indeed, it ranks with Foyle, Frost, and Gentley.  Don't miss this series.  And especially don't miss ""Neighbors,"" with Kevin Whatley.  I've had neighbors like that!!",1362268800,5,616,4.638888888888889
8377361,5,B002PWVW76,"My wife and I were born in the wrong country (the US).  We've joked about how our tastes lead us to be the ""odd ones"" among those we know, but if we lived in the UK we'd just be another normal couple.  Murder in Mind is one of those shows that really made the point evident for us.  We used to have a subscription to the pay television service DirecTV solely for the purpose of being able to watch BBC America.  At the time (between 2001 and 2005) BBCA was putting on some of the better programming from the UK.  Some of it we'd already seen, but when we first encountered Murder in Mind, we had an instant love for the series.

Every Monday evening the program was on at 9:00 PM following Jonathan Creek.  This was part of BBCA's then excellent programming block: Mystery Mondays.  We became obsessed with the show and wee even more excited to learn that a third series was upcoming on BBCA.  I recorded every episode and we checked episode guides to make sure nothing was missed.  The writing in the stories was superb.  The quality of the actors was of the highest calibre.  We saw plenty of familiar faces from other movies and TV shows we liked.  But most intriguing of all was that each story put you inside the mind of the killer.  Instead of the detectives being the focus, the killer was.

Many of the stories were written as ""what if"" scenarios, many times making the killer somewhat a victim of circumstances.  Some killers were sympathetic, others were quite insane, and others were just incompetent.  But in every case you really were immersed in the thinking of the killer.  This was not a show for the blood, guts, shock and ""ass kicking"" crowd.  This was a show for thinkers.  The person who enjoys looking at someone else figure out a problem would likely enjoy this show.  While the import price is expensive, the show is of a quality that fits the price if you are a fan of well done British mysteries.",1354838400,10,1921,4.4314285714285715
8377362,5,B002PWVW76,"Instead of one detective in a series of cases, this series has entirely different actors in each episode. Each episode is an entirely new story involving a murder.  They are all extremely well written.  But here is the very best part. All the actors you've grown to love in both the tv and film world from the UK are the actors in each episode. There are twists galore in this series too.  Someone for example may get away with the murder only to be done in some other way. These UK series are truly outstanding and it is very easy to get spoiled by the uniform high quality.
