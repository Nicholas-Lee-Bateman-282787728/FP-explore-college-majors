7861253,5,6304100787,"I was a HUGE fan of Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders when I was younger and saw it on television, and I was terribly disappointed when it went off the air.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore!  Jewel Riders is a colorful world of friendship, love, and adventure, with very little violence and ""suggestive"" themes like most of today's cartoons have.  The main characters are wonderful role models, and the show promotes love and friendship and believe in magic despite all odds.

This video contains the finale of the first season--definitely Jewel Riders at its best!  Gwen's evil aunt Kale disguises herself as Queen Anya and takes over all the magic jewels in the Jewel Keep, using them to absorb the Jewel Riders' powers, rendering their magic jewels useless!  Only the power of friendship (along with a beautiful song) can save the day!",1122249600,5,855,4.821917808219178
7861254,4,6304100787,My two young daughters enjoyed this video a lot. It was really wonderful for them to have women role models like this.  The characters are feminine and yet still strong and determined.  I definitely recommend this for girls ages 4 to 7.,1024358400,4,236,4.595238095238095
