Detective Dirk Gently uses holistic methods to investigate, linking a series of seemingly random events together to find an interconnected solution.

5169249,5,B008M0PBMM,"I am a big fan of all Douglas Adams' books, including the Dirk Gently books. I sought out this version after being disappointed by the terrible American version. I loved this version! It's too bad there were only 4 episodes due to licensing fees. I would have watched seasons of this!

Stephen Mangan is the perfect Dirk Gently. He is so funny and brings such a charm and likability to Dirk even when he is being unlikable. He is a great comic actor. I also liked Darren Boyd as his reluctant Watson. The plots are not exactly from the books but are definitely in the same spirit and with the same sense of humor.

I strongly recommend to watch ONLY this version and do not waste time with the other version! Or read Adams' very funny books!",1502496000,5,741,4.401459854014599

5169251,5,B008M0PBMM,"It's a totally different take from the other DG series, the Max Landis one  but this one is fun too. In details, it's much closer to the books, but I can see why it didn't take off and there's only 4 episodes. Dirk in this series is... well, he's a pretty genuinely unlikable guy. :-) They used a lot of elements from the books, but made up their own stories. Some of which contain some VERY Douglas-Adams-ish ideas in them. Especially the purpose of the computer program in the 3rd episode, holy cow.

If you like Douglas Adams, and can keep an open mind and remember that there's like 5 different versions of HHGTTG, I think you'll like it. And if you don't, don't worry  there's only 4 episodes anyway.",1485907200,,705,4.407692307692308

 RIP Douglas.

However, this attempt, is far superior to the version of this title that is out now, wherein Dirk, is no longer the main character.
Dirk has been made into some sort of low rent Doctor Who, while the Frodo Baggins actor, sputters constantly, like Mr. Dithers.

In conclusion: Watch this version of Dirk Gently

At nearly $6 an episode, it just isn't worth it. Sorry, Amazon.

5169271,4,B008M0PBMM,"I finished watching season 1 of the BBC series Dirk Gently. Of course ""Season 1"" implies that there's a ""Season 2"" (which there isn't) and ""Series"" usually implies more than four episodes (which is not the case). Not quite as twisted as the Adams books, and requiring an occasional suspension of scientific outrage (a'la CSI), the shows were huge fun and I am genuinely saddened that I've watched them all. Recommended if you liked the books and enjoy BBC British mysteries and crime shows. Supposedly there is a reboot coming out in October, but now Stephen Mangan is carved into my brain as the title character so I don't know how that's going to go over.",1468886400,2,657,4.672413793103448

Sadly the show was cancelled because it is amazing the way it has been affecting my life since I started watching it.  Perhaps it might affect your life too.  Maybe you will get a promotion, or your kid will get an A on his math test.  You just never know how the interconnectedness of all things will affect your life.  Stephen Mangan is excellent as Dirk.  He portrays the character perfectly.  His portrayal and brilliant writing add even more insight into a series character that was cut short after the untimely death of Douglas Adams.  For instance, most Private Investigators follow the person their client assigns to them, but Dirk just picks a stranger out of the crowd, follows him and sees where things end up.  And usually, it ends up exactly where it was supposed to end up.  Open your mind, give it a try, and you too might love the show also.  Gotta go, starting to get heartburn.

5169330,1,B008M0PBMM,"This is an absolutely TERRIBLE take on the Dirk Gently Holistic Detective Agency series of books. Sure, the writing uses some nods from the book (his real surname showing up on a computer screen in Episode 2, zen navigation, bending plot twists from from the book into new interpretations, even Douglas Adams' staunch atheism.) but the main the show gets terribly, terribly wrong is the characters.

I don't know who's responsible, but what they're clearly trying to do is ape the current portrayal of Sherlock from the new adaptation of the character. Maybe they figured since Sherlock was less of a jerk than Dirk Gently was in their novelizations, Dirk needs to be a much bigger jerk than Sherlock in the TV series. Sherlock already pushes the bounds of tolerability as a human being. The fact that Dirk hasn't been imprisoned for 15-20 years by the end of Episode 1 beggars belief.

Once I hit the end of the 3rd episode, I've determined that no amount of nods to Adams' fine work could salvage the series. Instead of making Dirk Gently more accessible to the public, they're now going to know his as the ridiculous jackass who stole his partner's investment into the company and refused to call him his partner, gets his partner beat up, stole from anyone when he thought he could get away it, and then sabotaged his partner's girlfriend's career to force his partner to keep working with him.",1409529600,2,1398,4.748971193415638

Every character was an exhausted cliche that's been done to death, with no new life added by these writers.  The selfish and manipulative but still charmingly quirky jerk who always gets everything right in the end; the idiot sidekick whose dumb bro act is an insulting take on modern masculinity; the girlfriend whose only story-lines are 1) how cruel and heartless it was that she once dared to break up with a guy in college even though he really really liked her, and 2) that she's the prize awarded to the dumb sidekick for... I don't know, sticking around till the end of the first episode?  The rest of the characters are even more two-dimensional, if such a thing is possible.  No one is likable.

It's not well filmed or well acted.  The dialogue isn't witty or engaging.  We were bored and annoyed watching it, which is saying something because usually we both like this kind of show, and we definitely both like Douglas Adams.

I guess, but Colombo was a man of principles and Dirk, not so much. Does he resemble Sherlock Holmes? He certainly picks up on clues that everyone else misses as he simultaneously abuses and deeply respects his sidekick McDuff. But his solutions to the crimes are totally random and he does purport to be a ""holistic detective"" meaning EVERYTHING is connected. That part makes the crime solving fun. Viewers are given lots of clues throughout the hour so you can try to answer the ""who done it?""  There's some science fiction thrown in randomly, but not overtly, so you are not sure where to place your suspended belief system. It's sort of a Doctor Who meets Sam Spade.

The Dirk Gently series is fun to watch, with a very good cast, however it does not fire on all cylinders and frequently seems to wander off page.

I say had because it was cancelled by BBC in a swath of budget cutbacks. Watch it and ponder to yourself, ""what if there was another season?"" of ""what if they had a little more money for special effects?"" or ""where's Thor?"".

I tried to see my way through the short four episode season, but literally found myself so distracted by the shameless disregard for any attempt to remain true to the author's vision, that I simply gave up midway through the final episode.  And it took significant effort to give this series that much attention.  Don't waste your time watching this series, as it is obvious in the dropping of the series after four episodes that no one else felt that the series merited further time, effort or money.",1396483200,2,823,4.774647887323944

Based on a 1987 novel by Adams, best known for having written all the different and conflicting versions of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Gently is a private detective more interested causality, quantum mechinics and who's paying for lunch. It seems that the series' creators merely skimmed the two (and a half) Gently novels presenting is a stripped-down shoe-string version of the ghost-horror-detective-time travel romantic comedy epic.

What makes this work is that he believes in what he is doing--he only has to convince almost everyone else. Dirk also has to try to be his own businessman and he is somewhat less successful at that.
Throughout the storyline is wonderful humor and that is what makes this series so much worth watching, that and his supporting cast trying to keep him grounded to reality. Mysteries abound here, just right for those of us who love a good mystery with a convoluted plot. Watch for twist and turns! Anything can happen to our hero!",1392940800,,801,4.569444444444445

I was seriously doubting where this was going to lead at the start of the first episode, but by the end of that same episode, I was anxious to see more.  The cast is stellar, and production values are right up there with some of the better TV available.

The plot of each episode appears realistic, and the main character a bit of a buffoon until the denoument, when a much broader and surpisingly satisfying scope comes into play.

Never heard or read anything about this show until Amazon offered it on Prime, so I put off looking at it for a while.  Now I'm sorry the series only had 4 episodes.  Are there more out there? Are more episodes being planned? I'll have to check out the books, in which I understand that the protagonist is a less telegenic middle-aged detective.

When they made the movie, ""I (heart) Huckabee's"" they used the same kind of detective to help solve those problems. These was like a 4 part mini series about that kind of detective.

Very funny, very Adams and well-played by all. I think BBC should have tried it here in the states before cancelling. Give it another go (with the same three actors) and you'd have a hit here. Aside from Hitchhiker fans, I think US Whovians would like it as well. And thanks to Amazon for giving us a chance to see it, at least.",1388793600,,494,4.32258064516129

Having read the books when they first came out, I was thrilled. I had no idea that ITV had attempted to make a series. It was very entertaining, smart, rather faithful to the themes of the books if not content. Many if the actors are quite recognizable from many other entertaining British shows. Lots of twists and turns as well as everything being connected to everything else. A shame that it didn't make it passed four episodes. It was quirky yes, but not beyond British quirky. If 'Hyperdrive' can make it twelve episodes, this should have made it as well.
Anyway, if you are in the mood for something a little different, give this holistic detective agency a try, you don't have to be familiar with the books or Douglas Adams to have an entertaining time.",1388793600,,917,4.497005988023952

Loosely based on the Douglas Adams' two novels it follows the adventures of the titled character as he solves crimes through the ""interconnection"" of unrelated events. Fans of Adams will be happy to see that one of his quirkiest characters was made into a television series. They will also be a little disappointed in seeing that this is a liberal interpretation of Adams' novel (no ghost, Norse gods, apocalyptic scenery, and no chain smoking Gently).

In four movies loosely based on the Douglas Adams books, Dirk spins his bizarre and implausible cases to their twisted inevitable conclusions. Readers of the Adams books will recognize the tongue-in-cheek inclusions of the refrigerator from hell, unpaid receptionist, mysterious homicidal cleaning lady and Gilks, the enraged police detective. See if you can spot the momentary flash of the giant stuffed eagle in his office.

Dripping snark and pizza remnants, Dirk runs up unlikely expenses while stealing food and linking random coincidences with his quantum-level theory of the interconnectedness of all things. He dupes Richard MacDuff (Darren Boyd) into financing and joining Dirk as his partner? assistant? patsy? much to the dismay of MacDuff's girlfriend, Susan Harmison (Helen Baxendale). They shamble though each case, often to MacDuff's horror, yet somehow survive and sorta triumph in the end.",1384128000,18,1008,5.631578947368421
