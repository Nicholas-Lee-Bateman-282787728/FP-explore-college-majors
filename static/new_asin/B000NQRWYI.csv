8180975,5,B000NQRWYI,i am a painter beginner and this dvd helped me to get started doing work in painter. i totally recommend it to all painter beginners.,1287360000,,133,4.36
8180976,5,B000NQRWYI,"I really enjoyed this DVD and learned a lot. When I first viewed the DVD I felt I didn't get much out of it. But when I watched it again after some experience with Painter I learned much more. I have included a painting I did while watching the painting section (lectures 10 to 17). Click on the customer images near the DVD cover. It isn't that good but it will give you an idea what can be done within a short amount of time from someone who isn't a concept artist nor has much professional experience with Painter (I do have a strong art background). Church's ideas will really help you draw faster with good results. Incidentally his concept sketch is fantastic.

The strong points were lectures 5 where Church details how to manipulate the brushes and the layer lecture (where he also corrects a scratchboard eraser that doesn't work. After his adjustments it works great) and lecture 7 where I learned how to use the paper palette to quickly add texture. That is something I am sure I will use quite a bit.

Another book I enjoyed (and actually used some of his ideas in my posted illustration) was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Advanced-Painter-Techniques/dp/0470284935/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Advanced Painter Techniques</a>&nbsp;which really rounded out my Painter knowledge. Between these two products I feel I should be doing some professional quality paintings soon.",1242259200,6,1426,5.277533039647577

8180978,5,B000NQRWYI,"I learned how to better tweak my brushes, how to easily paint textures, and how Ryan Church streamlines his workflow. Very worth it.",1222128000,2,132,4.782608695652174
8180979,5,B000NQRWYI,"The content in this DVD is great if you are interested in the subject of the digital painting process. Ryan Church is a master is this field, you'll be able to see how he uses the sofware. It also is good to watch  thehe brushes he uses and how he has created them. The only problem is that you will have to watch the DVD in your computer, it doesn't in run in a normal DVD player.

""In this DVD, Ryan Church introduces the viewer to Corel Painter. Ryan teaches the way he uses the program on a daily basis to create production artwork for the film and video game industries. From the basic first steps of setting up the Painter workspace and menus, to using brushes, layers, papers and textures, this DVD is perfect for anyone interested in learning traditional illustration techniques using Painter's powerful features and tools. As the lecture progresses, Ryan walks you through his process for creating a finished production illustration in real time, from sketching and designing, to composing and adding final details.

Over 3 hours of lecture.""",1212364800,7,1465,4.939024390243903
8180980,2,B000NQRWYI,"This reminds me a lot of the Corel Jeremy Sutton DVD.  Both cost $50.00 or more but only have about an hour's worth of real content.  In both cases you are not just paying for instruction but for ""bonus"" advertising by the artists.  In both cases if you just stick to the manual or instructions on the DVD, though it would take longer than a visual/audio
demo (that is the one I hoped for but did not get), you find the same info but far, far more of it.

Maybe it was just my particular copy of Church's DVD, but another problem was that about 10% of the far left and 10-20% of the bottom sections of the DVD were not visible!!  For example it showed a man talking at the bottom of the screen and his mouth could not be seen.",1190678400,5,726,4.084507042253521
