6854771,2,B00Q5NNSS2,"Flippant and shallow documentary about Cannon Pictures will likely please people who know little about the studio beyond the fact that they made Chuck Norris and Charles Bronson movies in the 1980's.  Writer/director Mark Hatley races through the rise and fall of Cannon under Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus much faster than was necessary, hitting the studio's highs and lows and showing clips from many of Cannon's most bizarre or campy films.  Most of the interview clips are short and if a lengthy anecdote is being told director Mark Hartley will frequently cut among two or three different people telling the same story--an odd creative choice which gives the impression that at least some of the interview footage is scripted.

There's a clear agenda to make it seem like Cannon was a home for schlock that got no respect from the rest of Hollywood.  Electric Boogaloo claims that Runaway Train received no Hollywood love because it was from Cannon.  But how does that make sense when Runaway Train actually received Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Jon Voight), Best Supporting Actor (Eric Roberts) and Best Film Editing?

There is also very brief soundbite from director Jerry Schatzberg but no mention of the movie he made for Cannon, an extremely well-received 1987 film called Street Smart that gave an unknown middle-aged actor named Morgan Freeman his big break.  Morgan Freeman received an Oscar nomination.  He won an Independent Spirit Award and numerous major critics awards.  His costar Kathy Baker also won multiple critics awards.  A Dutch Cannon production called The Assault even won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 1986.

Electric Boogaloo also suggests that the John Cassavetes film Love Streams was a punishing, unwatchable self-indulgent slog whose only purpose was to attract other high-end filmmakers by showing that if Cannon could work with the notoriously difficult Cassavetes they could work with anyone.  In reality Love Streams received rave reviews with many critics calling it possibly the idiosyncratic actor/director's finest film.  It has a 100% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Canon wasn't as disreputable as Electric Boogaloo claims.  A comparatively large amount of time is devoted to the notorious Sylvester Stallone arm-wrestling bomb Over the Top but the more successful Stallone pic Cobra which Canon also produced gets completely ignored.  Writer/director Mark Hartley offers a very narrow view of Cannon and excludes any information that contradicts it.

Very little credit is given to action stars Chuck Norris and Charles Bronson whose movies are dismissed as campy junk.  Hartley even allows two of his talking heads to insult Charles Bronson, a genuine action icon who appeared in classic films like The Magnificent Seven; The Great Escape; The Dirty Dozen and Once Upon A Time in the West and was one of the biggest stars of the 1970's before winding his career down at Cannon.

Hatley's choice of talking heads could also have been improved.  Filmmaker Rusty Lemorande is given a lot of onscreen time despite the fact that he never directed a complete film at Cannon--even the most obsessive B movie buffs likely have no idea who he is.  Meanwhile Albert Pyun who is credited with directing five films at Cannon and another for Menahem Golan's post-Cannon company is given almost no screen time.  It's also hard to believe that Eric Roberts, Jon Voight, Rebecca De Mornay, Kathy Baker, Morgan Freeman,  Ryan O'Neal, Isabella Rossellini and Gena Rowlands all would have refused to appear on camera--although Hartley manages to find plenty of time for Bo Derek, Sybil Danning and Cassandra Peterson.  Are you starting to see a pattern here?

Electric Boogaloo also misrepresents what went wrong with Superman 4.  Mark Hartley states that the budget for Superman 4 was cut drastically.  It would be more accurate to say that Cannon ran out of money during filming.  John Cryer was pretty vocal about the fact that Superman 4 had a great script but Cannon rushed the movie into theaters in an unfinished form--why not have him comment in Electric Boogaloo or use interviews he gave in the past if Cryer wasn't available?

Being a Cannon fan I was disappointed with Electric Boogaloo--it provides some occasional entertainment and fun archival footage and film clips but Cannon's legacy is a lot more complicated and interesting than Hartley's documentary suggests.",1430006400,9,4440,5.162011173184357
6854772,5,B00Q5NNSS2,"An outstanding and highly entertaining documentary from Mark Hartley, who gave us the classic Ozploitation documentary.

While I own a great many Cannon films and remember some I saw years ago, this doco brought back fond memories of wonderful trashy stuff like Lemon Popsicle, Hot Chili, Mata Hari and The Young Warriors, which have instantly gone on my purchase list.

Golan and Globus displayed a true maverick attitude, at odds with the Hollywood of their time, not caring about the superficial trappings but about movies. For me personally, The Delta Force, Death Wish II, Death Wish 3, Invasion USA, Missing In Action, Breakdance, Enter The Ninja are absolute classics. As Israelies to boot, its wonderful that they didn't push any blatant Jewish propaganda on their audience (despite the negative critical repsonse to The Delta Force) but simply wanted to entertain and make money doing so.

Breakdance was one of my childhood favourites as I saw it at a community centre in 1984 and thought it was the coolest thing in the world! For my money, Death Wish II and 3 are the greatest vigilante movies ever made, along with Dirty Harry, Savage Streets and Class of 1984. No politically-correct crap or moral ambiguity, just blatant and remorseless execution of justice. Cannon also made Chuck Norriss best films- The Delta Force and Invasion USA, which are total action classics.

And the sex and sleaze smouldering in the likes of Lady Chatterleys Lover, Bolero, Mata Hari, Sahara and The Wicked Lady rank up with the Euro smut-peddler kings Jess Franco and Joe DAmato!

As the documentary observes, Runaway Train deserved an Oscar and probably would have got one if not for industry snobbery. At one point, Cannon controlled Thorn-EMI, Elstree Studios and nearly half of the UK cinema market. Yes, they did the misbegotten Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2 and overstretched their capacity with King Solomons Mines, Masters Of The Universe and Superman IV, which eventually led to their downfall, but I still find their films far more entertaining and genuine than what is produced today. And at least they went down in flames with a don't care attitude!

Today, the likes of The Expendables, Crank and Shoot Em Up are really Cannon Films with CGI and a big budget. When I look at trailers for new entries of Mad Max, Terminator, Batman, Star Wars etc., I just want to cry. Cyncial crap from soulless executives running Sony, Disney, Fox etc., who don't give a damn about their audience, just their paycheck. And this whole reboot obsession where they take bits and pieces of previous movies and paste them together without attempting to maintain any link or timeline is a joke. Supposedly aimed at a new generation, which means a bunch of stupid spoilt brats raised on computer games and facebook, who will probably just download the movie anyway and then forget it in a week.

At least in the 80s people had to physically get off their lazy butt and attend a cinema, take a gamble on something, give something a chance without checking out an app or youtube or what some other geek said on facebook. And for me, Cannon always delivered the goods.
A terrific effort, highly recommended. Bring on more please- Hammer, Amicus, Filmirage, Medusa, Shaw Bros. So many independent companies deserving documentaries.",1427932800,,3313,4.9585585585585585
8690477,4,B00Q5NNSS2,"This is a documentary about the rise and fall of Cannon Films, the movie production company Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus ran (into the ground) from the late '70s through the early '90s.  It features several actors, directors, writers and other crew members who were involved with the studio such as Sybil Danning, Bo Derek, Michael Dudikoff, Molly Ringwald and Franco Zeffirelli, and while some of them have pleasant things to say about their experiences, most of their accounts elucidate that Golan and Globus' management style, to quote Armand in The Birdcage, was ""like riding a psychotic horse toward a burning stable.""  Make sure to start paying attention as soon as you press the play button because the documentary delivers a lot of facts at a breakneck pace in a method similar to how Golan and Globus produced movies.",1503878400,,828,4.9496402877697845

8690479,3,B00Q5NNSS2,"I was reading other reviews which suaded my rating a bit.  The fact that Lucinda Dickey and Michael ""Boogaloo Shrimp"" Chambers are still alive is what sold me on this.  When I was growing up in Miami in the 80s and 90s, I used to breakdance and watch 'Breakin''.  Before the internet, we always took each other's words as gospel.  So when a friend told me that 'Boogaloo Shrimp' died due to breaking his neck performing a headspin and Lucinda Dickey went into hiding due to the film legacy she left behind, I was distraught.  Fast forward to now and this documentary just busted those myths.  I am so happy and excited that there are still around.  Although, I wish Ms. Dickey was still acting.  I feel she has the chops to do it now.",1444176000,,734,4.385185185185185
8690480,3,B00Q5NNSS2,"For all fans of old cinema, action, b movies, and cinema history, I can't recommend this enough. It's fun and most of all, nostalgic. It's a very fun watch for anyone who grew up, or lived in the area of watching Cannon films. It also makes you appreciate the Golan/Globus partnership and all its glory they brought. I only list it as 3 stars because of the hassle it was to receive this film. I only ordered it through a 3rd party because I saw no information on a U.S. Distributor. Of course, I see a week ago that it's coming out next month, officially in the U.S. Save your money, wait till the U.S. Release, which I will likely buy. I had one copy sent to me with the disc loose, spent my own money to have it sent back, only to receive yet another copy with the disc loose inside and damaged. I'm calling it a loss and just waiting for the next month's release. Shame...I bought this as a gift but I can't give this as a gift, while damaged. So I'm keeping it for myself. Very disappointed with DaaVeeDee.",1439164800,,1011,4.243523316062176

8690483,5,B00Q5NNSS2,"If you grew up on these movies like I did, then this documentary is a must own. Being a kid raised on VHS in the 80's and 90's, nothing felt more like home than Cannon movies. You knew you were getting guns, explosions, one-liners, B-heroes, an endless barrage of faceless bad guys, and plenty of scantily clad women. The story of how a studio came to be, that would make so many of these movies, will blow your mind!",1434153600,3,417,4.291139240506329

8690485,4,B00Q5NNSS2,"I actually saw this movie at FantasticFest 2014 in Austin, TX and again at MondoCon 2014 in Austin.  I will say that this is not a celebration of the films that Canon released, but rather the backstory of the studio and what these men did for their love of film.  Looking back on the films that I saw that were in the Canon catalog, I developed a love for the ""popcorn move' as a medium for entertainment only, not to receive awards or be put in the lists of classic cinema, but to give movie buffs the entertainment of over the top violence, nudity, and completely unbelievable stunts.  In the days of Canon, I will say I saw most of the movies they did, especially the Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, and loved them all equally for the entertainment value, as they appealed to my cravings for just that.  To look at this documentary as a celebration of the films from the Canon catalog is not the way to watch this movie.  It is for people to look back and see what lengths people will go for their craft.  I will recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh at what they enjoyed in cinema from that era, and maybe see some they missed and revisit them later.",1430784000,,1174,4.289592760180995
8690486,4,B00Q5NNSS2,"This film is an obscure doc for true cinephiles. Chances are, if you've seen a film from the 80's and early 90's, it was a Cannon film. Chuck Norris, Charles Bronson, Dolph Lundgren, Bo Derek, Brooke Shields, and that dude from the 90's tv show, Cobra! Commander! But, I digress. This film gives you a pretty good insight into how films were made...by Cannon standards. I had no idea that Cannon is responsible for Superman IV: A Quest for Peace. Nuclear Man was an ex Chippendales dancer...so yea, rescue ranger, not so much. Get ready to impress your friends and/or spouse with useless trivia! This film contains extensive interviews with cast, directors and crew, with a timeline of pretty much every film they produced; all of their films are given their fair due. My personal favorite is Masters of the Universe. Like, I own the DVD, blu-ray and Dru Struzan theatrical poster I purchased from eBay that read 27"" x 40"", but it was slightly larger and I had to squeeze it into a Michael's frame that was marked down 30% from 50% off.",1430524800,2,1036,4.635869565217392
