4459945,5,B004RA7YEO,Great for those black and white film buffs. I has the best collection I have seen of RONALD HOWARD and H. MARION-CRAWFORD as Sherlock and Dr. Watson. Great price too!,1323388800,2,166,4.566666666666666
4459946,3,B004RA7YEO,"While this series does not match the quality of the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, it is still a very serviceable show.  The plots, while deviating from the canon, are still generally good and the acting is decent.  While I concur with other reviewers' comments on the quality of the public-domain prints, it is still the complete series of 39 episodes and for #3.99, the price is certainly reasonable.

On disc #3, the episode entitled ""The Neurotic Detective"" abruptly ends at time interval 21:49 and then goes immediately to the end credits (just to be clear: this is not a DVD-playback issue; it is a an issue with the source material).  Since most of the episodes run at about 25 minutes in terms of episode length (before the end credits roll), I am wondering if this particular episode is missing any footage?

4459947,1,B004RA7YEO,"I'm a huge Sherlock Holmes fan and after reading one of the reviews
that mention Dr. Watson was treated intelligently and not like a
buffoon in the English television episodes, I was anxious to order
this collection.  The sound quality is horrible.  There is an
underlying hum that is maddening.  But at $5.99 it would cost
more to send it back than keep.  Save your money.",1295308800,10,373,4.606060606060606
4459948,3,B004RA7YEO,"As noted in the first review of this set, there are 8 films and the complete 1954 Sherlock Holmes television series starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and Howard Marion Crawford as a Watson much closer to the character Doyle depicted in his novels and stories than the Fox/Universal film series.  No brain-dead Nigel Bruce version of Watson is to be found in that TV series.  All in all a very enjoyable series with some clever original stories for once set in the time period of the original stories.  Howard plays Holmes with a rather impish and delightful sense of humor, a man helping out the underdog and the oppressed.

The three films starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes depict the Great Detective as smug, insufferable and superior to everyone.  There is none of the humor Jeremy Brett or even Basil Rathbone brought to the character.  Reginald Owen plays Reginald Owen in one film.  In fact, to me, he ALWAYS played Reginald Owen in whatever film he was in.

There are four films with the Rathbone/Bruce team from their days with Universal studios where the stories are set in the then current time period of the 1940s.  Rathbone was always a very good Holmes, but Bruce, a fine actor stuck with a one-note comic relief role, leaves a lot to be desired as Watson.  This is the fault of the scripts where he is bumbling comic relief, not the actor, who is skilled enough to make this version of Watson somewhat likeable, if not the way Doyle intended him.

So why the 3 star rating?  The quality of these public domain films and the 1954 television series are poor, with lots of surface noise, occasional dialog skips and absolutely no work done to clean them up.  In the case of the Wontner and Owens films, the prints are sometimes so dirty it's hard to make out what is going on.  However, I paid $6.99 for this set at Target and that is a good buy for this many hours of entertainment, particularly the 1954 series with Howard and Crawford.

However, the Holmes fanatic is probably best served by the never-to-be-topped but not inexpensive Jeremy Brett Granada Sherlock Holmes television series/films of 1984-1995.",1286064000,32,2122,4.697297297297298
4459949,5,B004RA7YEO,"The feature movies as has been presented in the March 2010 Amazon review (above) are a nice sampling of the earlier movie portrayals of Sherlock Holmes.  But for me the TV serial of Sherlock Holmes was a surprising favorite.  Ronald Howard - no relation to U.S. Actor/director Ron Howard but rather the son of Leslie Howard - is a less creepy but believable  Sherlock Holmes - and he and the cast clearly had a good time on the set.  The quality of the TV series is surprising - and occasional on-location filming is fun and interesting to view (including the inserts from early silent film of London and Paris).  Really a clever TV program that I am glad can be seen today.  The quality is pretty good - not great - and not terrible.

Well worth the low price of 5 DVDs...",1282608000,14,773,4.401408450704225
4459950,5,B004RA7YEO,"It is tempting to deduct marks because of these not being digitally restored, but I am so thrilled to have this collection of 39 television episodes (and they were dirt cheap).  Until recently I was completely unaware of this 1950's television series.  I have since discovered that you can watch them on hulu, but the DVDs provide a commercial-free viewing option, and make a nice addition to my Holmes collection.  Ronald Howard, who plays Holmes, is son of the rather more famous actor, Leslie Howard.

The television series is on three disks, and as a bonus you get two more disks with four Basil Rathbone movies, three movies staring Arthur Wontner, and one with Reginald Owen.  Of course, if you're into Basil Rathbone, there are better collections, including some colorized and even a complete collection of all 14 of his Holmes movies digitally restored.",1282521600,8,861,4.951388888888889
4459951,2,B004RA7YEO,"I love Sherlock Holmes stories and movie adaptations.  This collection includes a nice cross section of fine stories, but the transfers are not restored (and probably taken from public domain copies of copies in some cases).  However, the low quality, grainy, vintage-looking transfers do give the videos an added element of old England's atmospheric ambience.  But it takes another leap of suspended disbelief to fully enjoy them because we are so spoiled with great-looking hi-def discs.  Mill Creek should find a way to restore these prints and they'd really have something cool.",1274745600,6,582,5.293478260869565

4459970,4,B004RA7YEO,"General information about Sherlock Holmes DVD's:  (corrected from an earlier mis-printing of this review)
This is one of MANY  many reasonably priced, mixed sets, featuring older films made of the Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, from the silent era of film making to the present day. These are a great way to explore the enduring history of the classic Sherlock Holmes character.  You get some of the oldest films: from the early 1900's, both silent and sound including a Basil Rathbone feature film from the early-mid 1940's and 3, 25-minute episodes from the the mid 1950's  which were the only such films made at the time in France, for American TV viewers staring Ronald Howard and H Marion Crawford. Two of these 3  reflect the days when Dr Watson and Holmes FIRST MET each other. The Howard and Crawford relationship as Holmes and Watson, is simplistic but very warm and more balanced between the two ""pals"", better than many of the later  portrayals, and they're light hearted as well... interesting!  Overall: a very good introduction to  ""The fictional character who took on life and helped teach humanity how to think more wisely"".

Another word:  the quality of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce films, 14 in all, are available in the un-restored format as well as a restored format. The restored films were done by the University Of California at Los Angeles and they did a great job, which makes them VERY much more enjoyable to watch. You need to look through the reviews for these if you want them, they are often not identified in the descriptions. also Legend Films has COLORIZED 4 of the most popular Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce features which REALLY makes them seem like NEW films and they use the RESTORED versions so they are really nice. They may colorize the other 10 films if the popularity keeps growing.  Of the Ronald Howard and H Marion Crawford TV series of 1954, only 39 episodes are available the other episodes were never recovered.

I've been aware of Sherlock Holmes films since the early 1950's when my dad watched the Ronald Howard series on TV.  Somewhere in the 1980's I stumbled across a DVD with a few of those Ronald Howard movies on it and that began my search for all things Sherlock. My wife and I have about 160 episodes from silent movies to the modern versions of Sherlock staring Benedict Cumberbatch, Johny Lee Miller and Robert Downy Jr. They all have their own unique way of portraying the detective that A.C. Doyle created. Even the films that re-created the early years of The writer of the mysteries have been done by British actors like Ian Richardson and others as well as many true films showing how it was Doyle himself and his professor in Scotland that actually WERE Sherlock and Watson. Also many films were created to show how Doyle and Professor Bell actually were the worlds first consulting detectives who provided police departments everywhere with the facts and methods of forensic detection which are still used today.  The films are both educational and very entertaining. There is also a recent book produced in England titled: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson: The Day They Met.

The set is old, but its certainly still entertaining.

Film quality is typical for productions of the period, as is acting and characterization, however I do enjoy older dectective or sleuthy type films.
If this was not a subject that held my interest it probably wouldn't be on my ""buy"" list. As it is I'll watch it more than once.

It's typcal of English sets of the period, but the gaslight London scenes and English countryside are worth watching these for if nothing else.
The horses, buggys, costumes and sets are all very well done for the period, and it's the sets that make it relatively easy to fall into the storylines.

If you're hypercritical and expect everything remastered or colorized to the n'th degree, then you may want to give this a pass, but if you enjoy these period releases with the odd blemish adding to the character you might just enjoy it as much as myself.
