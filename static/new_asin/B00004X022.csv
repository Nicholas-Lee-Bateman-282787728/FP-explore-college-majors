1366887,4,B00004X022,"I rented this movie after reading the back. I had heard of Catherine Cookson before, read a few of her novels. I thought ""It has costumes and was written by a famous novelist, how bad could it be?"" I sat and watched the whole movie in one sitting. I was glued to the couch.
The acting was good and I immidiatly fell in love with the main character. The costuming was accurate, as was the setting. The story on the whole was a bit predictable, but still very much enjoyable. I immidiatly had to buy it.
Basic plot: A young boy runs drugs to a strange old man in his big house. He finds out that the rich man's wife is having a baby from another man. He is paid off not to tell anyone. Years later he has to return to the house and finds that the little baby girl has been living in the attic. He takes the child away and the rich man who is insane comes after them with the intent to kill. The rich man is found murdered an its not until the end of the movie that we find out who killed him. The main character is the little boy grown up. Basically the story revolves around finding out who killed the man and why. There are several love stories involved as well. Overall, a great movie.",1031529600,13,1186,4.094420600858369

1366890,1,B00004X022,"Thinking this was the inspirational DVD about the law of attraction, I puchased ten copies to give as gifts...afterall the DVD was on sale for the low, low price of only $14.99!!! How could I not spread the good word?  Minutes after I placed the order, I realized my mistake and attempted to cancel.  Unfortunately Amazon said the order was already being packaged and I was too late. I can only hope my friends enjoy this BBC unrated thriller and that the producers of this 2003 film are worthy of reaping the benefits from those of us who were overly anxious to take advantage of the sale price...live and learn...always read the fine print before completing your purchase with Amazon!!!",1163980800,22,688,4.725
1366891,3,B00004X022,"Although some of the reviews suggest it, this is not the documentary movie that I have been recommending to my friends and family. I have not seen this particular movie, just wanted to give a second warning to those whom I had given this link to.",1161820800,24,246,4.369565217391305
1366892,2,B00004X022,"If you understand the concept of manifesting, you're not going to find anything new here.  It's an inexpensively produced DVD of sound and sight bites, all encouraging the audience to think positive.  It's a nice pep talk, but not worth the thirty dollars I paid for it at a local bookstore.",1160006400,6,291,4.686274509803922
1366893,1,B00004X022,"There is a secret here. But that idea behind the secret in the film is called ""The Law of Attraction"". It's the belief that if you think and believe positive thoughts and emotions deep down, then good emotions, people, and events will be attracted to you. But the real secret concerning this film is that the belief is a lie.

First of all, when watching the authors and ""Doctors"" speak about how it is the people who complain about being sick that get sick, and how the happy and encouraging people don't get sick, I am thinking about my experiences. If this is true, how come some of the most positive people I know have illnesses that the doctors have said is terminal. They never complain, and you wouldn't know they had cancer or any other disease by talking to them. Also, how come some of the most amazing and positive people I know have lost children and spouses in tragic ways. This just doesn't hold together, especially since the teaching behind this film is that good things will ""always"" happen.

Secondly, this sets up people for self criticle lies. If a person is sincerely positive, and something bad happens to them, then this teaching will make them blame themselves for what might be something someone else has done.

And thirdly, what about the promises here? Okay, so if I am dreaming of getting this one role in a film, and

another person is dreaming about the same thing and we are both equally sincere, how does it work out?

Finally, the emphasis of this film is on yourself. It is about how you feel, how you look, and how rich you are. Pretty shallow.",1159920000,15,1579,4.526315789473684
1366894,5,B00004X022,"I think the real value of the film lies in the fact that it gives a true meaning to ""think optimistically"" and ""think positive"". I have come across many people who believe they think positive but all they really do is applying a meaningless label to a heap of anxieties, pessimism, fear, you name it. That is not positive thinking. The film was invaluable for me in explaining how real positive thinking differs from what I have just mentioned.

I personally find that although they do repeat these slogans several times in the film, they have a good reason to do so: every time they expand on the concept and explain how to start thinking positively when you may find that you have no reason to do so or you do not know how to do so with all the unhappiness and negativity in your life.

I am familiar with the concept of positive thinking/the law of attraction, and have read a good deal of the literature on this concept, from a quantum physics, psychological or even theological point of view, but have not found such a vivid, comprehensible, step-by-step explanation of what it actually means and how to practice it.

If you just tell people that ""according to the law of attraction you will attract more negativity in your life"" they may not understand the hows and whys of this process. This film provides a detailed and highly useful explanation of the hows and whys involved in the creative process, according to which you need to feel, expect and act to elicit change.",1159747200,24,1478,4.590909090909091
1366895,5,B00004X022,"Nothing in this movie was new to me. I have been studying the teachings of Abraham and Seth for years. And yet, the film was still very well done, inspiring, and is full of anecdoctal evidence to support the claims that this universe we live in is an intelligent one. As the many experts in the fields of science and spirituality who appear in the film note, the circumstances of our lives are in fact a result of the thoughts, emotions, and overall energy we emit. While similar in theme and message to ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", I found this film to be much more in alignment with what I know to be true about the laws of the universe. Don't hesitate to buy this movie...it could very well be the most important film you ever see.",1159315200,15,735,4.294964028776978
1366896,5,B00004X022,"The intro was a bit dramatic, but the content was absolutely fascinating.  Perhaps a small percent of the population has already been exposed to this field of thought, but it was absolutely fresh and exciting for me.  I LOVED this movie and have recommended it to everyone I know.  One of the few movies I've felt this way about.

Tapping the power of our mind is the next phase of our evolution... I'm excited to see where that takes us and how modern science & technology will attempt to explain the mind/body/universe connection.",1158969600,13,532,4.688172043010753
1366897,4,B00004X022,"This documentary is expressing the message that all the great spiritual teachers of the ages such as Jesus, Bhudda, Confucius, Muhammad, and contemporary thinkers such as Carl Jung, Joseph Campbell, and James Allen have echoed.  The message is simple but awesome, ""thought, feeling, desire are at the very heart of material reality"".  It is because of this mystical quality that it may be easily dismissed as it has been by the massess through out history.  At the same time the principle here as it has come to be best expressed in ""quantum physics"" maybe presented in a way that oversimplifies the complexity of the soul and reality. It has that amoral childlike quality that the greek Gods possessed, ""omnipotence to serve their own egocentrism"".  But in so doing increases in clearity, power to motivate, light the imagination, and plants a powerful seed.",1158105600,50,859,5.028169014084507

7925869,1,B00004X022,"Having read and enjoyed probably more than 20 Catherine Cookson novels, I had not read The Secret (The Harrogate Secret) when I ran across the DVD and decided to watch it. I expected it to be of similar quality to other Cookson stories. However, this drama, presented in three episodes, impressed me as being almost nothing but negative, somber, and with an over-supply of bitterness, rancor and violence. I found little or nothing in it uplifting and pleasant. Previously I had watched DVD's of The Moth, The Cinder Path, The Wingless Bird and A Dinner of Herbs, finding all of those to be well produced and enjoyable.. However, The Secret was, in my opinion, almost a complete waste of time. I continued to watch it all the way through, hoping, I suppose, for an eventual improvement to something more satisfying and enjoyable, but in the end regretted that it was, in my opinion, almost a complete waste of time.",1359504000,5,915,4.761006289308176
7925870,5,B00004X022,"I've seen this movie a thousand times on videocassette on my VCR.  I didn't see the DVD version because the provider had none left in stock.  They did refund my money but Amazon still wants me to review it so I will.  I like to see Catherine Cookson's stories more than I like to read them.  This was one of my favorites.  It has unrequited love, a pretty girl, a good guy who's not so pretty, and a pretty guy who's not so good.  What more could you want?",1348185600,7,456,4.067415730337078

taste.that sort takes away from one avenue of suspense.the rest of the
story is fairly predictable,though it has a few minor surprises.i found
it actually quite depressing.i even felt it had a bit of an oppressive
feel to it.the synopsis on the back of the DVD cover makes it seem much
more compelling and dramatic than it actually is.i mostly thought it
was boring.maybe you have to be in a certain mood or frame of mind to
appreciate it.if so,i clearly wasn't in the right mood or frame of
mind.i just know i was glad when it was over.i don't see myself
watching this movie again.for me,The Secret would have been best left

7925872,3,B00004X022,"Emma Faraday is a wife and mother with two healthy children and a satisfying career, all seems fine and they are happy. Then one day her old friend, Nadia, re-enters her life, with only one goal in mind, revenge.

Emma has been keeping a secret from her childhood. This information about her self is so shameful to her that she has even kept hidden for years from everyone, including her husband. This situation sets her up to be taken advantage of by her old friend. Not wanting the secret out, Emma relinquishes almost total control to Nadia who systematically destroys her life.

Choices have to be made. Does Emma let her life and happiness be taken away or does she fight to keep her family together. The suspense that the lead character feels does come through the screen. This saga is a made for BBC TV production.",1194480000,,821,4.578231292517007
7925873,5,B00004X022,"I'm amazed at all the comments on here. Are none of you able to read a cast list or dvd description? I wanted The Secret starring Stella Gonet and Haydn Gwynne, searched and found it. I didn't get swayed by whatever this other film is - it wasn't the correct one and so I didn't click on it. I think it's highly unfair to give something a bad review just because you ordered the wrong dvd. If you can't be bothered to read the description properly then maybe you're not ready for online shopping.

As for this drama, as you would expect from a BBC production, the writing was fine, actors excellent and the story gripping. Interesting to see actors in different roles from the norm. Haydn Gwynne (Drop the Dead Donkey) is normally known for playing strong, assertive characters. Stella Gonet (House of Elliot) gentle, softer characters. Each actress now gets to play the opposite and they do a fine job. Well worth viewing.",1185667200,14,923,4.593939393939394
7925874,5,B00004X022,This is a realistic account of how relationships can spoil through fear and denial of events or occurances in one's life. It has a rewarding ending to make up for the difficulties encountered through the process of self-discovery.,1174435200,4,230,5.078947368421052
7925875,3,B00004X022,"I actually ordered this product by mistake but that is on me. I want to make sure that those who are looking for the secret regarding the law of attraction, please do not buy this by mistake as I did. Although it is a fairly decent story, it is not what you are looking for in the secret so purchase what you are looking for first and perhaps if you have extra money and time to spend then you can buy this one also, further down on your list.

This movie is about a life secret that people had been carrying for years. It finally caught up with them. It is a decent story, but definitely not ""The Secret"" you are expecting for spiritual growth, enlightenment, and/or financial success.
