2691235,5,B000KHX7HG,"Years ago the producer of this awesome documentary ""Say Amen Somebody"" Karen Nierenberg, loaned me her video copy for viewing. I was so impressed with the gospel singing, the high caliber and multi-facited informational content of this film that I requested a copy for myself. At the time she didn't have access to any others and thought perhaps if I looked around I could find a copy.

Well, at that time there were no DVDs; I went on line to obtain a video copy and found a few copies that were new or used, however they were expensive.

Over the years I never forgot about this film,and so a couple of months ago, I went on line to see if a DVD had been made available and found out that a deluxe DVD was being produced; I was elated and pre-ordered a copy. I have recently received this DVD and find it to be REAL GEM!!

For openers, it isn't packaged like a DVD. It looks like a small hard covered book that includes 24 pages of original rare photos and essays by gospel music scholar, Anthony Heilbut, as well as DVD commentary by the director, George T. Nierenberg. As a bonus, a 15-song soundtrack CD is also included.

I feel blessed to have found out that this wonderful film has been formated to DVD and at an affordable cost

Many thanks to the producers of this extraordinary documentary.

2691236,3,B000KHX7HG,I only seen it once and I enjoyed it the gospel music was good! And it a reminder to follow jesus in your life before time runs out and there is no rapture its about jesus coming back again to take his people home! And it won't be in secret!

2691238,5,B000KHX7HG,"Very engrossing documentary, and musically stimulating as well. Showed it at a Black History Month program and the attendees were riveted.

The concerts, programs and church services was very emotional to watch and I could not help but think that so much more was happening in the background.

2691242,4,B000KHX7HG,"I loved it when this came on TV and I have been waiting YEARS to get it on DVD.  I LOVE the packaging because it looks like a book.  I very much like receiving a DVD AND a CD which contained the songs on the DVD.  The ONLY issue that causes me not to rate this item as a ""5"" is that the CD freezes on the Convention scene.  Personally, for me, this was the best part.  This was a gift to an elderly lady who I love very much.  She was ecstatic and cried tears of joy throughout the DVD so I was very disappointed when the DVD froze. I wanted to return the DVD but the lady said don't bother because she had the CD to listen to the music and she might die before a replacement came and she would have missed out looking at the DVD over and over and over again.  Therefore, my rating was reduced to a ""4.""",1441843200,2,803,3.8597560975609757

2691267,5,B000KHX7HG,"I first heard about this movie when it first came out and Roger Ebert gave it an outstanding review. People who saw it in the show would tell me about how people in the show would get the spirit while watching this movie. One night it appeared on PBS and I could not believe what I had just saw. Everything and more to hear Mother Smith sing and to hear Delores Barrett Campbell and her sisters sing was mind blowing. Finally it came out on dvd and that was when I realize that the version I saw ono PBS was different than the version on dvd and that was a good thing. Now to be able to actually hear from the director and his thought process about making this movie was great. Also just to be able to listen to just the music on a seperate cd was also great. Now I can't wait for it to come out on blue ray, somebody say aman!",1309996800,,827,4.0181818181818185

2691275,5,B000KHX7HG,"When I traveled to Osaka this summer, a colleague had the Bonus Deluxe version of Say Amen Somebody in his collection.  I teach a course on Religion in the African American Community and I am always looking for course materials.  I requested and received permission to view my colleague's copy. It was an amazing afternoon.

This video collection serves as a natural companion to literary works by Thomas Dorsey (Inspirational Thoughts [1935], The Thomas Dorsey Story [1961], and Songs with a Message: With my Ups and Downs [1941]).  Students can see beautiful images of Dorsey and hear his voice and those of other great gospel singers from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

Through ""Say Amen Somebody"" my students here in the United States have access to an African-American Church Convention experience as they watch and listen to gospel choir members in workshops, and note the way the leaders of the Gospel Music Convention consecrate the convention hall, converting secular space to sacred space.

The up close video clips of Mother Sally Martin and Mr. Dorsey makes this documentary a classic.",1253404800,2,1090,5.027777777777778
2691276,4,B000KHX7HG,"Wife and I saw this on the little screen a few years ago,  perhaps it was just after being made.  We loved the story,  and Thomas Dorsey,  who is featured in the film.  We lost the VHS tape that we had made that night,  and decided recently to see if we could find the film on Amazon.  It is a high quality product,  a very nice leather-looking case,  with the DVD of the original production and a CD of the music.  Very nice.",1237161600,,426,4.024096385542169

Had the video vcr, loaned it out (gone), and was delighted find this crisp version of the movie with great sound on DVD. You can skip right to the songs, too, but do not miss the entire program. These gospel pioneers are no longer with us and the whole field has been more ""popped up."" These are the real deal singers, revival singers. My elderly mother was thrilled to see this on my new LCD screen, with stereo speakers right in her face. You'll clap you'll cry.
Bonus CD too. You can't go wrong.",1187049600,2,558,4.273584905660377
2691281,5,B000KHX7HG,"As I've grown old and live far, far away from the place of my youth, I yearn for my Southern roots that keep pullin' on me.  This DVD and CD music bonus set help transport me back to a time that I remember with fondness.  Although I'm Jewish, I was raised by a Black Baptist woman and grew up with Gospel all around me.  What struck me about Gospel was its soulful messages that transcended religious boundaries most of the time.  If you listen closely, you won't hear Jesus in every Gospel message.  No, you will hear messages about being free and crossin' over Jordan, or messages about the time of the Judgement comin' and being re-united with your family in heaven, messages that have its roots founded in African-American slavery.  As an adolescent, I couldn't wait for Sunday mornings to listen to the Black radio station's Gospel Train program and listen to all the tremendous artists that the White world was oblivious to and, unfortunately, were kept from knowing. Even with all those years of sneaking around to listen to my Gospel music, I hadn't heard of Mother Willie Mae Ford Smith, but you'll learn why if you buy this DVD set because I'm sad to say, this DVD is the only medium where you will ever hear her tremendous recorded voice!  If you want to have the hair stand on end, just wait until you hear Mother Smith belt out ""I'll Never Turn Back.""  But the most tender moment comes when Thomas Dorsey is sitting with Sallie Martin and he realizes that the song, ""If You See My Saviour,"" playing in the background on an old record player, is the very one of his own first recording.  To witness Sallie Martin begin singing along with the record and then to have Dorsey join in, well, it's a moment in musical history that, thanks to DVD technology, I'll get to relive time and time again.  The real bonus in buying this set, however, is the booklet that fills in all the unanswered questions that the DVD leaves hanging.  You will enjoy ""Say Amen Somebody"" dozens of times if you buy this DVD set.",1184544000,9,2013,4.502747252747253
2691282,5,B000KHX7HG,"Regardless of anyone's race or creed, this movie provides rare nourishment for the soul. With its message of love and hope contagious, Director Nierenberg fashions a touchingly human and uplifting portrait of gospel music that translates how this special music has sustained people through adversity. A humbling and glorious film.",1183939200,2,330,5.62
2691283,5,B000KHX7HG,"As great documentaries have gained a new audience in  independent film, it's fun to revisit some of the movies that transformed the genre and infused it with more humanity and feeling. While the Maysles' works were fundamental, it would be tough to omit SAY AMEN, SOMEBODY from the list of greats.

This beautiful, uplifting film focuses largely on the late-life careers of Thomas A Dorsey and the amazing Willie Mae Ford Smith. In an unsentimental and elegaic way, we witness the end of era -- one that shaped American culture, and also gave immeasurable help to people of color from the 1920's through the mid-eighties, when commercial producers replaced the veterans at leading labels.

One of the most amazing qualities of this beautifuly photograhed, edited and recorded film is that its emotional magnetism would convince an atheist to examine the faith of others with more introspection. It is not the scenes of ministers speaking in tongues or parishioners being annointed that matter here as much as the infectious lyrics and rhythm of indelible performances. Couched somewhere between traditional blues and early R&B, gospel haped part of what it means to be American --and this beautifully designed set pays it the homage it deserves.

For a VERY low price, I received a 70-minute CD with 15 of the best performances from the film, and the remastered film on DVD with a photographic gallery and other features. The two dics are packed in a hardcover long-pack with an informative booklet -- all of it well-designed.

I rank this documentary with SALESMAN, HARLAN COUNTY, USA; TOSCA'S KISS, GREY GARDENS, WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE and perhaps five or six other fwonderful ilms. Personally, I wouldn't miss this DVD-and-soundtrack set for the world.",1178496000,15,1754,5.076388888888889
2691284,5,B000KHX7HG,"""Say Amen, Somebody"" was released on DVD by Xenon Pictures in 2001; so, this is not the first release, but it is still an amazing documentary. I had the pleasure to go on a Caribbean jazz cruise on which the Barrett Sisters were scheduled to sing the first Saturday night with little fanfare. They were so thrilling that the ship cancelled the Wednesday's  evening shows for both those on the jazz cruise and the rest of the passengers and subsituted the Barrett Sisters (featured here. To say they brought down the house (or ship if you must) was an understatement. Willie Mae Ford Smith, Thomas A. Dorsey and The O'Neal Twins plus The Barrett Sisters make this essential watching even if you think you won't be moved by Gospel. This is one amazing documentary. It was premiered at the Telluride Movie Festival and Roger Ebert told me one of the most thrilling moments of his life was seeing the film followed by the stars appearing live after the movie. I wish I had been there but seeing the Barrett Sisters was close enough. Search out their few CDs; they are brilliant. If you have not watched the recently Paul Simon Gospel All-Star DVD do so. It's a close second to ""Say Amen, Somebody.""",1175212800,18,1194,4.605633802816901
2691285,5,B000KHX7HG,"I was wondering which would come first....the rapture, or the DVD release of Say Amen, Somebody.  This fantastic and uplifting documentary on the founders of gospel music is definitely my favorite documentary of all time.  I had an old VHS that was pretty much worn out - this is one movie that you can watch and enjoy over and over again - so when I found out that Say Amen, Somebody was not only being released as a 'Bonus Deluxe' DVD, but that it would also include a CD of the soundtrack, I was shouting for joy!  Pop the DVD in your home player, or the CD in your car stereo, and you'll be uplifted.

The packaging is very impressive, including a booklet with articles on the movie as well as the featured artists, a director's commentary, and indexed musical numbers for when you want to skip ahead to the good stuff.  Lots of vintage photos, both in the booklet and on the DVD, add to the quality and collectibility of this DVD set.  This was true history in the making.
