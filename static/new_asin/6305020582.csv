949383,3,6305020582,"this movie was a pretty good sequel to the first one. but it should have been better. i think that if it weren't for the acting ability of brigitte lin this movie would have been a flop. don't get me wrong its a good movie but when you compare it to the first one you can tell it falls short and carries all the symptoms of sequalitis. the best part of the whole movie, which about 90 min. in length, is the end scenes. even though i give it a lower rating i would recommend getting this one, or you will never know how the story ends.",984873600,,535,4.009345794392523
949384,4,6305020582,"While Bride part two is not the powerful film that part one is, it is still a very good conclusion to a great story.  The story paces very well and while Leslie Chueng should have had a bigger part, the ending made this  flick worth the time and money I paid for it.  If you've seen part one you  need to see part two but in it's original form.  Not the english voice over  version, but the subtitle one and if at all possible, get it on DVD.",937353600,2,442,3.965909090909091
949475,2,6305020582,"The story line is direction is okay.  Action sequences are good but not spectacular.  Fast-paced and confusing at times.  It took me 2-days to watch, since I fell asleep on it the first time.",1178409600,,191,4.5588235294117645
949476,3,6305020582,"I loved part 1  , but just to let everyone know before you buy it. The language says english and the cover is in english , but only the subtitle is in english. There is no where on the dvd to change it.",1161216000,2,202,3.697674418604651
949477,4,6305020582,"The Bride With White Hair 2 followed quickly upon the success of the original movie, taking up the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and his forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin).  By betraying his sacred pledge that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster.  Ni-Chang's fury over Cho's betrayal drives her completely mad, transforming her into the white-haired witch who lives only to destroy every living member of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs.  As for Cho, he has retreated to Mount Shin Fung, guarding over a mystical flower whose bloom (and it only blooms once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves.

Ten years have passed since the deadly night that Ni-Chang went mad and almost single-handedly destroyed the Wu Tang clan.  Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has stood guard at Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho's nephew Kit (Sunny Chan).  With Kit's impending marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to further the bloodline exists - and so it is that Ni-Chang crashes the party, kidnaps the young bride, and takes her back to her own private castle full of man-hating, deadly women.  There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the witch's ""See a man, kill a man"" philosophy and programmed to kill Kit with her own hands.

The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try and kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are all almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses her deadly hair as a most effective weapon (sounds weird, I know, but it works really well).  It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for a most unforgettable reunion between the two former lovers.

This sequel is a more direct, action-oriented film than the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason I actually found it more enjoyable on the surface.  Still, though, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet again face to face until the final scene - although that meeting is well worth the wait.  Most certainly, if you've seen and enjoyed the original, you'll want to experience this sequel.",1135814400,8,2266,4.752551020408164
949478,4,6305020582,"It's always hard to film a sequel to a great classic like ""Bride With White Hair."" I agree that the change in directors is to blame. Poor Brigitte Lin really mopes around in this film. Even in her depressed state, Brigitte is stunningly lovely. Christy Chung's role was amusing. I think the actors did their best with the script. As a huge Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung fan, it's still a good movie. The chemistry could have been better but remember they only had the final scenes together when their characters come face to face. It's hard to be combustible when you have approximately 10 minutes of screen time together.",1094601600,4,623,4.672727272727273
949479,2,6305020582,"Bride with the white hair had hardly any action and really disappointed me.  I like the story line and everything and it's pretty sad, but I wanted to see more fight scenes.  Don't get this movie is you are expecting action.",1072483200,,224,4.439024390243903
949480,5,6305020582,"This is a great movie and well done. The only bad thing here is that, Part 2 was suppose to come out before part 1. Becuz after watching part 1, you get the feeling you want to watch part 2 with hopes of the characters continuing just like that.. Trust me, this is one of the great movies ever, watch 2 first, you would be craving to watch part 1.. And there ya go, you would watch it over again.. Well Done..",1062115200,4,409,4.0
949481,1,6305020582,"I rented this film immediatley after seeing the first Bride with White Hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story.  There was a perfect setup for a sequel and I couldn't wait to watch it unfold.  After the first half an hour I knew that director Ronnie Yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn't really give a damn about how interesting the story was.  Poor dialogue, inadequate story, there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film.  If you enjoyed the first BWWH you'll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying.",1020643200,4,621,4.5675675675675675
949482,4,6305020582,"This film is no where near the level of the first film. This however still places it ahead of a great many films. If you loved the first film like me than you will be willing to sit through some corny acting and fighting to get to the end where Leslie and Brigitte finally see each other again. The first film had a great open ending and this film ties up the loose ends nicely. Therefor if you loved the first movie buy this and see what really happens at the end, if you didn't love the first movie pretend leslie dies on the moutain.",1010361600,2,536,4.114285714285714
949483,1,6305020582,"Pretend this never happened.  BWWH 1 was heaps better.  This sequel is garbage... don't bother.  For the record, I would rate Bride With White Hair 8.5/10",990057600,4,154,4.846153846153846
949484,4,6305020582,"For those who have seen the original - don't expect this one to focus on Bridgette Lin and Leslie Cheung.  This movie stars an all new cast of young actors who manage to carry the movie pretty well.  The movie focuses on what happened after the 2 star crossed lovers separate - 10 years after the original 'betrayal' and now Bridgette Lin has become a powerful but evil martial arts master who is embittered against all men.  I have to admit I was disappointed that Leslie did not have a bigger part in this movie, and that they did not focus on the 2 main characters as much but the ending is one that should not be missed.",987811200,,624,4.271186440677966

7880769,1,6305020582,"The Bride with White Hair is a cool, strange, violent trip with lots of memorable moments that stay with you.

The Bride with White Hair 2 is none of these things.  This sequel barely shows the cast from the first movie, choosing instead to focus on a motley bunch of junior ""masters"" that use lame humor and laughable martial techniques to make their way through the silly plot.

The sharp social commentary of the first film is non-existent here.  There is some bizarre lesbian separatist warrior enclave that -- surprise, surprise -- hates men.  There is a bunch of star-crossed and confusing romantic angles. There are very dated special effects.

What a disappointment.",1223856000,2,674,4.920353982300885
