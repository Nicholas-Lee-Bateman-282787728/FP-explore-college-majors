108543,4,0790740664,"My 10 yr. old grandson wanted to know what God looked like and I told him he could look like anyone he wanted, then decided to get him this movie.  It involved a kid so I thought he could relate.  Even though not modern day views, I thought it was funny and great for a kid and a lot less harsh as some movies can be today when showing the negative side of not believing.",1259625600,,371,3.933333333333333

108545,5,0790740664,"I ordered the Oh God series: Oh God, Oh God Book II, and Oh God - You Devil.  I showed the first 2 movies to our church youth group.  They are timeless and good for children and adults of all ages.  The 3rd movie, Oh God - You Devil is definitely for a more mature audience and I would not recommend it for children less than high school age.",1240272000,3,342,3.927536231884058
108546,5,0790740664,"I teach a small youth group at our small church, various ages 5-10 and this movie was a great way to show them that it is never too young to share the word of God, nor is it always easy to answer his call.  The kids all loved it.  It is still relevant even after all of these years.  George Burns was the best.",1236211200,,310,3.8125
108547,3,0790740664,"Let's face it, sequels usually never surpass the original. Sure Terminator 2 and Godfather 2 are exceptions, but in the movie world, it's a simple fact sequels suck! But just because it's not usually as good as the original, does not mean that Oh God Book II is a bad movie. I actually think it deserves more credit. George Burns reprises his role as God and that within itself is a good thing because portraying our Lord is no easy feat and he saves the movie from every aspect.  It's basically the same premise as OH God, only this time it's a little girl told to spread the Word. The cast is a bunch of nobodies and mind you some of the acting is pretty bad, but the little girl Tracy Richards played by (Louanne - don't ask why she has no last name, nobody really knows) but Louanne does an acceptable acting job and her little body doing big things for God makes you want to stick with it until it's all over. The script is not as creative as the original and is as predictable as any sequel could ever be, but it's still fun.  There are some touching moments between George Burns and the Louanne especially at the end of the movie when God makes his grand appearance in front of everyone.

OH God Book II certainly didn't win any academy awards and it's not as good as the original or even OH God You Devil, but it still manages to be enjoyable thanks to the funny antics of George Burns.",1149379200,13,1394,4.2727272727272725
108548,5,0790740664,"I absolutely love this movie! One night when I was bored flipping the channels I found this movie and I am so glad that I did. It was a really creative twist on faith. A little girl thinks that God is telling her to post signs in her school saying ""think God"" and the whole rest goes from there. It is adorable, very creative and inspirational especially for people of faith; although it would cause some thinking in nonbelievers. The little girl is so cute and reminds me of myself when I was little. It's kind of funny how a little child was able to believe when the adults wouldn't. George Burns makes a great God in this movie. I'm going to make sure I own a copy of this movie. Make sure you watch it. The ending is really sweet. Also check  out the first edition ""Oh God"" and Oh God, you Devil"".",1077753600,14,801,4.201298701298701
108549,1,0790740664,"George Burns reprises his role of the Almighty in ""Oh God! Book II"", a 1980 sequel to the popular ""Oh, God"".  Burns was great as an incarnation of the Deity in ""Oh, God!"" and with good  direction by Carl Reiner, the movie was also good.  He's still good in  ""Book II"", yet the movie isn't.
Part of the problem is they  didn't come up with a distinct and original story, a departure from what we  got in the first film.  The cover for the video reads ""That's right, I  made another movie,"" yet as far as I can see this is not another  movie, but pretty much the same movie.  It does (except for Burns) have  different characters and therefore different situations, but from beginning  to end ""Book II"" is all too similar to its predecessor.
Like  its predecessor, the sequel has God coming back for the same reasons.  ""They are still not thinking about me,"" he says.  ""People  have to be reminded I'm still around.""  This time, he chooses a young  girl named Tracy (played by a where-is-she-now actress who just went by  ""Louanne"") and like the late John Denver in the original, she is  surprised when she gets a message to meet God.  Also like Denver, she  thinks it's a practical joke when she hears Burns' voice at the meeting  place.  But alas, like the first movie, she comes to believe and wants to  get his message across.
Tracy's father (David Birney) is in advertising,  so she tries to figure out a way to advertise God (as Denver did), finally  coming up with the brilliant slogan ""Think God"".  She then  organizes a group of her fellow students in the school auditorium (how  would be a good question) and proposes her plan to post signs and write  ""Think God"" wherever they can.
Soon some kids can be seen  crossing out some graffiti that says ""Grass is good for you"" to  write ""Think God"".  Later, Tracy's mother (Suzanne Pleshette)  rationalizes to the school principal that ""kids are going to write  things on walls anyway, why not 'Think God'?""  (What a dumb line.  ""Think God"" is just as much graffiti as ""Grass is good for  you."")
Anyway, the similarity between the two films goes on right to  the very end.  I won't tell you the climax, but it's about as close as they  could get within the context of the different characters.  The denouement  is also pretty much the same.
I liked ""Oh, God!"" but I can't  recommend this sequel (reproduction) with its plastic characters and cutesy  situations.  George Burns is the standout, yet even he is just repeating  his original good performance.  They even have him spouting the same  mistakes-of-nature type jokes.  Warner Brothers really took the easy way  out.  They stayed with something that worked, and they played it safe.  Don't fall for it.",964915200,13,2711,4.595789473684211

108610,3,0790740664,"I watched the first ""Oh, God!"" decades ago, but George Burns is always a charmer so I decided to check out the sequel.  However, apart from a thoughtful slogan ""Think God"" that was introduced (and which I've since seen on billboards in San Antonio), the film was rather stale - even for its era - and not nearly as clever as the original.  Sorry, but I couldn't give it more that three stars.",1486771200,,392,4.3561643835616435

108615,5,0790740664,"Forget about how dated it looks -- the substance of this story is quite profound. Instead of going for farce or cheap laughs, the filmmakers decided to depict a realistic scenario of how we would view a child who claims to have spoken to and seen God, and it rings true for its era. It's also incredibly heartwarming, Luanne is amazing, and, if you remember seeing this back in the day, you gotta love all the retroness -- no seatbelts! Cynics will hate it, but all children should see this film -- and this comes from someone who is basically an atheist. A good message is a good message, period.",1469836800,4,597,4.4363636363636365

108833,5,0790740664,"This is the second of the ""Oh God!"" series.  I bought all three DVDs because I love George Burns and the story gives invaluable life lessons.  Good for kids too.",1350518400,,161,4.333333333333333
108834,5,0790740664,"I seen this movie for the first time on August 21,2012. I'm very near and dear to God. I have all the books,devotions,and bibles I can have about him. I know this is a movie... But I saw him him tonight. I know this sounds wierd. Not visually because of the movie but supernaturally. I've been going through things lately. This movie made my situations so clear. Think God. I absolutely love this movie. I can't wait to have a child to share this with. Im filling sooo filled with God right now..... SOOO in love with God right now.... This is a must see.",1345507200,2,555,4.295238095238095
108835,4,0790740664,So great to have one of the classic movies from my childhood on dvd.  It's great fun to watch and the little girl is wonderful--what ever happened to her?  George Burns is hilarious as always.,1319068800,,192,4.457142857142857
108836,4,0790740664,"i guess i must be a bad judge of films. so many of the reviews for this film give it a poor rating. I loved it. I thought giving George Burns's character a chance to interact with the kids was wonderful stuff. i admired the young girls stamina for sticking with God and seeing it through even in the face of being placed in an institution for mentally unstable people. one wonders how a remake would create the character today. no doubt the character would be foul mouthed and rude, times change although the unique spin on God created by George Burns would no doubt win in the end. What a good actor he was. he makes me want to believe in religion.",1319068800,,649,4.284552845528455
108837,2,0790740664,"Lackluster sequel to ""Oh, God!"" (1977) offers little new and plays like a 1980 made-for-TV movie. The only saving grace is the inimitable George Burns, who delivers his one-liners with customary &eacute;lan. Skip ""Book II"" and proceed to the superior final installment, ""Oh, God! You Devil"" (1984).",1290902400,2,298,5.361702127659575
