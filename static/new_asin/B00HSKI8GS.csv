6204334,5,B00HSKI8GS,The characters and stories are great and if you like the Three Musketeers this show is a definite must. The only complaint I have is that they try to put to much into a single episode which can at times make it feel rushed. But this is an issue I tend to find in most series that have short season.,1404000000,,298,3.9833333333333334
6204335,5,B00HSKI8GS,"I liked this a lot, seemed to have a more realistic look of the time.",1403913600,,69,3.6666666666666665
6204336,5,B00HSKI8GS,"With the latest television adaptation of ""The Musketeers"", the BBC has finally managed to perfect the technique that was originally utilized in the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robin-Hood/dp/B003TY2SUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robin Hood</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>&nbsp;- that of taking a legendary hero (or in this case, group of heroes), keeping their iconic personalities, background and conflicts intact, but throwing them into an episodic series of adventures that allows for original storylines, personal character development, and a variety of guest-stars. Suffice to say, if you enjoyed the energy, style and general premise of those previous shows, you're pretty much the target audience for ""The Musketeers.""

But whereas ""Robin Hood"" inexplicably killed off vitally important characters in its season two finale (leaving the survivors to meander listlessly through an awful final season) and ""Merlin"" clung so strongly to its formula (""keep the magic secret"") that it shut down all possibility of any meaningful development, ""The Musketeers"" finds that happy balance between plot and character. Throw in a good grasp of continuity, high production values, and actors that embody their roles to perfection, and this a show that fully delivers on its promise of being swashbuckling fun for the whole family - emphasis on *fun*.

If you're a fan of Alexandre Dumas's novel (and subsequent sequels) be warned that you're not going to find a faithful retelling of the plot. Instead, the writers are more concerned with keeping the spirit of the novel intact whilst spinning their own tales across the ten forty-five minute episodes that comprise the first season. And despite the departure from Dumas's stories, the scripts are pretty solidly written. Sure, they follow familiar plots (rescue a damsel in distress, thwart an assassin, clear the name of an innocent man/woman, hunt down a dangerous criminal), but there are very few plot-holes and some unexpected twists in the usual formula. Best of all - nobody is stupid, least of all our heroes. So many stories rely on characters behaving like idiots or ignoring the obvious, but this show very much pits intelligent villains against equally intelligent heroes, giving everything a real sense of suspense and tension.

The cast is impeccable. Seriously, there's not a weak note among them, and it's going to be difficult accepting future actors in these roles, so brilliantly does this cast embody each character. Tom Burke is a droll and world-weary Athos, the de-facto leader of the group who has perpetual suffering in his eyes despite his snarky quips. Santiago Cabrera (who played Lancelot on Merlin) is the free-spirited Aramis, whose religious faith and gentlemanly air belies his enjoyment of hedonistic pleasures.

Luke Pasqualino is a wonderful D'artagnan, capturing his youth, inexperience and hot-headedness without tipping him into obnoxiousness, whilst Howard Charles is probably the best Porthos I've ever seen. In a lovely touch, the writers draw upon Alexandre Dumas's personal history to map out the backstory of Porthos (in conversation, Porthos mentions that his mother was a freed slave; Alexandre Dumas was the son of a black Haitian, who in turn was the son of an aristocratic French father and a freed slave, Marie-Cesette). Already people are kicking up a fuss that the character is being played by a mixed-race actor, though I honestly don't see how anyone could watch five seconds of Howard Charles in the role and not think that he wasn't born to play Porthos.

Peter Capaldi is Cardinal Armand de Richelieu - so wonderfully nuanced in his plotting and scheming that I'm almost resentful that we're going to lose him to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00HJ1N7IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, whilst Ryan Gage has the thankless task of playing King Louis XIII as a petulant man-child. Yet even he injects his role with a sense of pathos: this is a king surrounded by more competent, intelligent men, and despite all his posturing and bluster, Louis KNOWS it. That self-awareness does wonders in generating sympathy in the audience, for there's a clear effort on Louis's behalf in trying to keep up with those around him.

For a show that's headlined by so many male stars, you may be forgiven for thinking that there's no room for any women. There you'd be wrong. Tamla Kari is a wonderful Constance, with a weary tolerance but deep affection for all the Musketeers, who proves extremely useful when it comes to providing distractions and gathering information. Alexandra Dowling is a fragile and beautiful Queen Anne - perhaps a little underused at times, but with plenty of potential to grow as a character. And then of course, Maimie McCoy as Milady de Winter. It's my opinion that any adaptation of Dumas's story will rise or fall on its depiction of Milady, for she's the ultimate foil to the Musketeers, a woman whose seductive charms is about the only thing that could threaten their bromance. Here McCoy goes for femme fatale over guileless charm, making Milady a suitably cunning adversary. Yet the writing manages to explore her desire for revenge without demonizing her, and the simmering tension she leaves in her wake is one of the highpoints of the show.

Even the guest-stars bring it their all, with appearances from Jason Flemying, Zoe Tapper, James Callis, JJ Feild, Annabelle Wallis, Vinnie Jones, John Lynch and Tara Fitzgerald (basically, a bevy of familiar faces that you'll recognize from Poirot, The Tudors, Merlin, Downton Abbey and a range of other BBC dramas).

In short, ""The Musketeers"" is like getting a mini-action movie every week, filled with verve and energy and charm. I honestly can't remember the last time a light-hearted drama left me this satisfied. The chemistry between the leads is fantastic, the characters imminently loveable (even the bad guys!), the theme music rousing, and everything about the costuming and set design is gorgeous.

I'd say it's suitable for younger viewers (perhaps ages eight and up), though parents might want to have a quick trawl-through before leaving children alone with it. The violence is largely stylized with minimal blood, and any bedroom scenes are largely composed of characters reclining in bed with their clothes on (or at least fully concealed under the covers).

But most importantly, this is a show that actually has *heroes* as its protagonists. In recent years it feels as though there's been an onslaught of anti-heroes on television, with shows revolving around drug-dealers, serial killers, vampires, pirates, smugglers and other unsavory folk. I've enjoyed plenty of those shows, but I honestly can't tell you how uplifting it is to watch a show starring likable, decent men who uphold the law, live by a code of conduct, respect women, and consistently place others before their own needs. Sure, they've got their foibles, but all of them are focused on doing the right thing, and living for something greater than themselves. How utterly refreshing.

""The Musketeers"" gets five whole-hearted stars from me.",1403395200,82,7334,5.458553791887125
6204337,4,B00HSKI8GS,"This show is a lot of swashbuckling fun! It's an update of the Three Musketeers, with some modern interpretations of the classic, while maintaining a period feel. The lead characters are great from episode 1 - full of humor and swaggering cool. That was satisfying enough, but I was thrilled when the show went deeper exploring the musketeers back story. In fact the whole cast is really fantastic (special mention of Peter Capaldi as the Cardinal).
I am really happy that they got a season 2 and I can't wait for more. Well worth your time.",1400544000,13,541,4.645833333333333
6204338,4,B00HSKI8GS,"Not bad at all. Direction is a bit over the top and a blatant musical score
with some irritating shouting, but all in all a fairly decent production.
Dumas Pere did a fantastic job with the Musketeer series and the MICHAEL YORK as D'Artagnan, Chealton Heston as Richelieu and RAQUEL WELCH as Constance is the benchmark production.
But,...this is NOT a waste of your time or money.

6204400,1,B00HSKI8GS,"Alexandre Dumas was a masterful storyteller, and this series insults both the memory of the man and the intelligence of anyone who has ever read the works of Alexandre Dumas. D'Atagnan sets off to Paris on his own with a letter of recommendation addressed to Monsieur Treville, but in this series we have him accompanied by his father who is shot by bandits. D'Atagnan doesn't encounter Milady until much later in the story, and even then, she only sleeps with him because she thinks he is Comte De Wardes.....she only has her assignations in the dark because she has the executioners stamp on her shoulder.  It appears the writers in their impatience, decided to center their writing around the swashbuckling, drinking and sex, and treat the actual story as a mere inconvenience.  The musketeers were an elite force and there is nothing impressive about the actors they cast, personally i think they should have cast this quartet as lackeys rather than the musketeers. Tom Burke does not even begin to capture the essence of the majestic Athos. Santiago Cabrera's portrayal of Aramis is at odds with the priestly, poem writing, scripture studying swashbuckler who struggled with ""righteousness"" I have never understood the arrogance of writers who think they can tell an author's story much better than the author him/herself. If they are such great storytellers, why not write their own epic tale?",1485648000,,1399,5.025862068965517

6204404,5,B00HSKI8GS,"The Musketeers is what youd call a must-watch series. I hesitated before picking this up. I mean, how many versions have already been done of Dumas story? But something said, go on, have a look. Well, I was riveted. First, the series is perfectly cast. I cannot imagine any other actors playing the roles that these performers filled. The costumes are perfect, the settings beautiful (even the grotty streets with mud, mud, and more mud), the action is real, and thankfully the fights are perfectly timed and do not go on so long that you're mentally saying, For pitys sake, kill him already!

The episodes pay homage to the original story, but veer off into great little side plots. Yes, you know that at the end of each episode things will be resolved in favour of the musketeers, but thats fine, thats good, and theres none of this new trend of producers to lure viewers into loving and rooting for a character, only to have him/her killed off in a nasty take that, suckers! kind of attitude. In fact, the very lack of vicious, gratuitous violence, abusive kinds of sex, and needless nudity that sadly seems to be popular with a famous series (no names here) is part of the reason why I stuck with and so enjoyed this series. Everything that happened was meaningful, within context, and played a part in the overall story arc.

For once, I want to mention the villains more than the heroes. Possibly because I have stopped watching The Walking Dead because for some reason the producers or the scriptwriters have turned a fine actor like Jeffrey Dean Morgan into a leering Mwahahaha villain with the depth of a puddle and little or no intrigue or back story to make one want to watch further. The Musketeers villains are just wonderful. From the coldly calculating and Machiavellian Richelieu (superbly and intelligently played by Peter Capaldi) to the psychotically cruel but lovelorn Comte de Rochefort (a brilliant Marc Warren) to the horribly creepy and plotting Marquis de Feron (also brilliantly played by an almost unrecognisable Rupert Everett) to Milady, whose love for her husband was destroyed. These villains all have some redeeming quality  hard to find in some cases, but its there. Richelieu loves France; Rochefort loves the queen; Feron discovers that he is, in fact, loved and accepted by Louis, and that changes everything. A villain must have depth for viewers to want to keep watching. Milady is a study in complexity and far from the surface villainess one might initially label her.

Another character I thought really warrants mentioning is Louis himself, and how actor Ryan Gage chose to portray him. Its hard to give life to someone who comes across as capricious, shallow, vain, and self centred. But Ryan Gage managed to imbue the character of Louis with a certain childlike charm, a naivet, and even an innocence, sheltered as he was from the realities of life. I thought the actor brought tremendous depth to a character who might have been dismissed as annoying but necessary.

Last but not least, take the time to watch the Extras on the DVDs. They are informative and very enjoyable. Sword fighting and horse riding is not as easy as these fine actors make it look.",1483920000,,3201,4.8127272727272725

6204419,5,B00HSKI8GS,"This is probably one of the best written and executed versions of the Musketeers that's ever been made. It has a romantic feel, but is gritty and dark in every sense, despite its goal for justice and honor to always prevail. Unlike many monarch-era series, you may be pleased to know that several reoccurring women take a less traditional roll and are very strong, and in some cases, very deadly. It's also incredibly refreshing to see a group of soldiers who are portrayed as good-hearted, strong, intelligent men. There's beautiful costuming to love. The series is well cast and acted, and not shy about showing the practiced combat skill that a musketeer might actually have.

6204498,5,B00HSKI8GS,"Though this series updates the feeling and story of the musketeers for a newer audience, the production is very true to the swashbuckling spirit of Dumas classics, as well as the 70's movies comedy that have come to embody them. The sword play is outstanding and heart pounding. This production goes with a less acrobatic style than seen in recent versions, but opts for a more realistic and gritty approach to the sword play (again, perhaps for a modern audience that wants less saccharin). There isn't much gore or anything like that, but the action still manages to be hard hitting. Along with the sword play, the series manages to keep the verbal repartee that preserves the comedic and intellectual sparing which is just as important to the feel of the Musketeers. The humor is much more natural and much more clever this time. Not clownish. This show is not a comedy, but the characters have very sharp wit. Many re-boots go very dark, losing the humor all together. The Musketeers are special though. The verbal fencing is every bit as important as the real sword play.

The Musketeers are a slightly more diverse crew in this version. Back stories are explained quickly and each persona is developed meticulously to help the viewer see their gallantness, their honor, their skill, and their rakishness. Each actor for Athos, Porthos, Aramis, and D'Artagnan seem nearly born for the part by the time they get a chance to establish character. Lady D'Winter didn't blow me over at first. But they skilfully bring you into her and Athos' relationship and humanize her, while showing her capable of the most vicious plans. She is the ultimate chess player! Athos is not as Priestly in this version, but he still piously and honorably conducts himself while exuding the melancholy shadow that haunts him. Constance in this version is not associated with the queen in any way. She is the wife of a modest textile merchant. The fact that she is married creates the tension between her and D'Artagnan. She is beautiful but girl-next-door-ish. Yet, she is a fiery red head that asks D'Artagnan to teach her some of the martial skills. One thing I haven't liked in other Musketeer productions was King Louis. He is supposed to be weak, but he was always so irritating. Here the problem is rectified. Ryan Gage is perfect for the part. Louis is appropriately weak and slightly foppish, but he is still regal and able to project strength when the situation calls for it. He is still very dependent on the Cardinal for his strength, but he is emerging. Let's call him developmental. I have a special mention for Queen Ann (played by Alexandra Dowling). She conveys such beauty, adorableness, fresh faced innocence. Yet Alexandra is able to pull off the tricky parts when Ann needs to take control and be a queen in every way, powerfully exerting herself. Alexandra seems to have that combination of erudite and innocence. Cardinal Richelieu is not as physically imposing as one might expect, but Peter Capaldi is able to pull off the darker recesses of his persona. He is not always at odds with the Musketeers in the beginning and seems to truly have France's interests at heart - along with his own. Even the ancillary characters in single episodes are so fleshed out that the viewer cares very much about them, or at least what they do. In British fashion, each episode is not designed to blow you over, but instead build the story layer on layer until you are queuing each episode one after the other to see what happens in the end.

Great effort was made in creating an authentic atmosphere of Paris 1625. The sets are meticulously sculpted to look very real. It's all very tactile and done to the highest quality so you can't tell the difference from real stone or added set. The costuming is stunning, though I am sure they took some dramatic license. The palaces, castles, costumes, countryside, and cinematography are all stupendous. Hauntingly beautiful. Even the color palates and focal points of light sources in every scene receive great attention, and it shows. Cinematic quality in a TV series! I rarely watch extras for any program. But these were terrific. The video regarding how they built the 1625 Paris world was very interesting.

Quality is apparent everywhere in this show. I expect it has the potential to run as a classic for many years if they can keep the budget, writing, and actors all assembled. It will be another icon of BBC productions.",1469577600,2,4464,4.802340702210663

The show keeps the essence of each Musketeer but meshes or reconfigures the characters' storylines and events from the books. Usually I get annoyed with this but it works here. They are dashing, extremely loyal, personable and that all for one, one for all, ""the inseparables"" really comes across. Love Santiago Cabrera as Aramis and I much prefer Aramis and Anne together than Anne and the Duke of Buckingham. I love that Constance is given much more prominence and the actress who plays her is utterly charming. All the female roles in the show are strong women. King Louis is immature and unsure of himself for a king and too easily influenced but fun to watch. He and Anne are more friends than husband and wife. I wish more time had been spent on Porthos and the relationship between Athos and D'Artagnon. Their accents came across as mostly English and not French which was both odd and ok.

I would have given this series a much higher grade if they had bothered to hire a reasonably intelligent writing team. Alas, no. Using 21st century wordplay instead of 15th here is jarring. In addition, it spoils the illusion of this very exciting time period. The viewer can't avoid the sense that a bunch of twenty-something thugs robbed a costume shop for a Halloween party but couldn't make out what their costumes represented. Poor Alexandre Dumas. After the excellent Count of Monte Christo production gave him wonderful exposure to our modern eyes, we have sunk to this high priced piece of trash. Boo...",1434758400,3,749,4.905511811023622

This show has action, adventure, friendship, romance, sword fighting, and so much more!  Once you watch one episode, you will want more...it is so well-written and entertaining.  I highly recommend this show for the entire family.  In fact, as soon as I finished season 1, I bought season 2.  Enjoy!",1432944000,,608,4.723809523809524

I read The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas many, many years ago and watching this series makes me want to read it again.  I have always enjoyed watching a good sword fight in movies and television (remember The Persuaders with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) so this series definitely meets that requirement.  The interaction between the characters is also interesting to watch as their friendships and relationships change and grow.

But there is just enough different plot lines thrown in to keep you interested, and like many BBC America shows - money is spent in the costumes/locations to give you a visual treat as well.

Now we are on to season 2, and I just have to say that I wish that someone would actually tell Athos, ""Dude, you do not love M'Lady. You are obsessed with her. Don't let her tell you otherwise! You cannot love someone who has hit you in the face with a flaming torch, murdered your brother and blackmailed your friend into attempting to kill you. That is not love. You are not in love, you are obsessed."" And I think that this little bit of therapy should come from D' Artagnan or better yet, Aramis who not only has a better grasp on love but seems to be the most reasonable of the group. When I think of a contemporary version of Athos and M'Lady's relationship, I just see abuse and sickness, divorce and jail time.",1423094400,,901,4.331360946745562

6205038,5,B00HSKI8GS,"I really really love this. But it started off as like, the more I watched the more I enjoyed the weaving of backstories with the political climate and ""mini crime solving dramatics"" of elite France in the 1600s. First and foremost, the men are beautiful and fun actors, very enjoyable complex characters. I think the writing for them is fantastic. The only thing that bothers me is that there is WAY too much ambient light. At night, there is light everywhere and lends a cheese factor. The modern lighting is distracting for me, but not enough to warrant turning it off. I binge watched the whole first reason in a few days and cannot wait for season 2 to unfold. Well done, BBC.

The other writing that is great are the three females, Constance, Milady and the Queen. They are extremely intelligent and their unique contributions to the series are awesome too. I love that the writing addresses womens issues, gender roles, Porthos being biracial (though it is hinted this will come back later, his parentage). Really fun themes spun into the plot.

There is ""sex"" in that the musketeers and other characters definitely sleep around, however, there is nothing particularly graphic. No grinding, no nudity, it's more hinted at than shown (the couple in bed after, as opposed to wasting two minutes watching them get it on) which I appreciate because teens could watch this too. Because they keep the sex toned down it is more family friendly that way.

Even the violence isn't gory. which is kinda nice. On the whole, the characters drive this series and it's great fun. The hardest part of watching it is trying to decide who is my favorite Musketeer.",1421712000,,1653,4.7526132404181185

6205071,5,B00HSKI8GS,By episode three I was hooked - By the end of the 1st season - I was craving season 2 and can't wait to see it.  Excellent series,1420416000,,129,3.607142857142857
6205072,2,B00HSKI8GS,"Nevertheless I couldn't help enjoying the last episode which pulled out all the stops - even if it did go ridiculously over the top in the final battle which was only a flesh and blood version of a computer game shootout. Those early pistols were never that useful. But at least in this episode the series 'concept' was pulling its full weight and playing to its strengths despite the contrivances of the plot which as usual seem to take place in some kind of parallel historical universe with all the absurd clarity of a dream. The reason why it worked is that it was fully energised by the good girl/bad girl opposition and by having Milady make a confusing and long delayed play for our sympathy.

Nonetheless the series as a whole was obviously directed at adolescents if we are to judge by the quality of the writing, which also includes the unconvincing plots since we're told it's all been 'created and written' by the same person. And, judging by the other reviews here, it seems to have been mainly successful with females of that age or perhaps a little older.
They seem to have been entranced by the four actors playing the leads; then by the two leading ladies who clearly represent for them the dual opposing aspects of their own female nature (towards the end of the series the Queen has emerged as a sort of higher level balancing principle of the female psyche); and of course by the 'period' costumes: and to such an extent that they are completely oblivious to the reality of the social and historical ethos and the violence, frequently brutal, often gratuitous, which abounds in every episode, - and they appear to regard it as all just good 'fun' and merely 'entertainment'. This is no accident of course, it has been deliberately designed to work in that way for the target audience. Anyone familiar with the cinema history of historical swashbucklers can see how they have ended up like this for a public that has been gradually inured to a higher level of realistic violence no matter how discordant with the other elements that have remained largely the same for nearly 100 years (the silent version from the 1921 with Douglas Fairbanks is on YouTube). Anyway the result is that this series is neither one thing or the other, nor a satisfactory melding of the two.

All very predictable I suppose, but this has been very interesting to me since I have been a life long devotee of Dumas' Musketeer novels, which is why I have watched every episode religiously but with dismay at the wasted opportunity that the whole series represents. Looking at it on the positive side I suppose that it does at least demonstrate that there is a market for a series of a suitably romantic swashbuckling nature, a market which I imagine would be even bigger if the exercise were in more competent or responsible hands than the individual who somehow managed to get this off the ground. The way he did this, and for just the same reason, the way the recent BBC Robin Hood and Merlin series turned out the way they did, would no doubt be very informative in terms of how popular culture is now produced, and probably always has been.
But again on the positive side at least the series had the saving grace of preserving a certain attitude of gallantry in amorous affairs, and chivalry in martial (not to be read as 'marital') affairs and matters of honour. Despite all the crude story lines, the clumsy plotting, the banal dialogue and the cliched trite humour there is still a residue of romance that stubbornly refuses to detach itself from these wonderful characters of Dumas'.
I would at least recommend this to anyone interested in the current state of the art fight arranging and editing as this has been quite impressive without being ridiculously gymnastic and choreographed Hong Kong style - in other words it has been quite convincingly realistic for the most part (except when they are using firearms, especially pistols). And I must admit I do find that the two principal ladies of the series have a certain fascination. I can't deny that Constance was a creation in the best tradition of romantic heroines who combine being really nice, and highly emotional, with being really sensible - rather like Olivia de Havilland in Flynn's Robin Hood, but with the added obligatory requirement these days of having learnt how to use a sword.
As regards the male characters the only one who seems to me to deserve special mention is the actor playing the King (Louis 13 in this parallel universe) who always brings some real life to the whole thing. He is remarkably vivid and stands out in every episode, though this is also sometimes helped by his role in the stories as a sort of naive, but infallible, moral arbiter.

One of the episodes, in which a Papal envoy was sent to poison Richelieu and in which a progressive feminist Countess was almost burned as a witch, was quite good, and only spoiled by some clumsy details in the plotting, the sort of thing that was common in other episodes.
The other episode which had something to recommend it was the one which involved the issue of slavery and which was only spoiled by the intrusion of comedy and by the stupid burning of Athos' mansion by Milady.

When I complain about the plots it's not so much the basic ideas that are the problem since there are limits to the kind of plots that can be used in hour long episodes as opposed to a true serial, and real originality may be asking a lot. So perhaps it's excusable that the plots are almost all ones that have been used many times before in Westerns, SF space operas, and thrillers. For more than half a century they have been the staple stuff of co-mixes (i.e. 'comics') . The real problem is the plots are not well enough rethought, and that plotting is too careless, for the idea to be convincingly brought off..
If the producer has any sense or self respect he will bring in a new writer, or team of new writers, for the second series. What this needs is some intelligent plots and plotting, and at least more intelligent, if not actual period, dialogue.
I notice that Amazon is claiming that this series has received critical aclaim. This certainly isn't true. In fact it's been universally ridiculed and dismissed by all the critics in all the papers that pride themselves on having actual critics rather than publicists.",1420416000,4,6344,4.666666666666667
6205073,5,B00HSKI8GS,"This is a wild run of action and humor. It's like a return to the swashbuckling movies of the 40's and 50's. Everything is very well done. Acting, sets, costumes are first rate. An example of fine detail are the firearms, which historically accurate to the era.

6205074,4,B00HSKI8GS,"Let me get the negative out of the way up front. Some of the situations which they get themselves into is completely ridiculous, no one with ounce of intelligence would do what he did. I do not give spoiler alerts so I cannot give you any examples. If you can look past how they got into the situation, then like me you can sit back and enjoy how they get out. Now for the positives, plenty of action, swords, knives, guns, explosives and hand to hand combat. The plots are pretty well thought out and there are several twist and turns throughout the season. At least every other episode something happens to make you say, ""I didn't see that coming"". The series has a little something for everyone, Romance, Comedy, Suspense and of course my favorite, ""Action"". There is no nudity or F bombs, and most folks will find it to be family friendly.

6205096,3,B00HSKI8GS,"This show is confusing. I can't really tell what the creators were going for. I love Dumas. He's a great writer with action packed ideas and a way of presenting them that is thoroughly entertaining. This is not quite that.

The opening music and credits is a blend of cartoony type music with a grungy type feel. So, you get the feeling that the show is edgy, but doesn't take itself all that seriously- maybe like it's geared to a younger audience. The costumes are modernized and sexed up a bit for the women and grunged up for the men, so the main characters are not sexy. They are dirty looking and not all that appealing. So, the viewer is left with no choice but to watch a bit to figure out where all this is going.

Athos is supposed to be the strongest of the bunch. He's moody and melancholic in the book, but not so much here- unless you count one episode that highlights his back story. He's also a father figure to D'Artagnan in the book. Again, not so much here. They are pretty much equals after the first episode.

D'Artagnan is portrayed more or less accurately.

Aramis' love was the church. That is not at all present in this series.

Porthos doesn't resemble Dumas' version in any way.

Still, there are some jolly adventures and novel plots. With elements like royalty, swords, costumes, love, loyalty, and treachery, there is bound to be a little something for everyone.

6205133,5,B00HSKI8GS,"Like watching Three Musketeer movies, this series is brilliantly written, filmed and performed.  Believable, engaging, plenty of swordplay, intelligent writing, enthusiastic believable acting and more.  One of the best filmed series since the Tudors, the Musketeers are brought to life with careful, smart plots, great dp/filming, costuming, set design and above all else, engaging action and dialogue that works.  Superb series, A+ glad I ordered this to watch on amazon, a new gem well worth watching.

6205148,5,B00HSKI8GS,"I am a long time lover of the 3 Musketeers, and have often been disgusted by the comical, rather goofy, take on these characters.  This version of the Musketeers is what I have been waiting for, apparently.  It is a grown up version of the story, and although they do take liberties with the literary portion of the storytelling, the spirit of the novel is definitely present.  I have actually found a version of Athos that does not overdo it on the angst, while still showing the torment he goes through do to his past with Milady D'Winter.  D'artagnan is young is exuberant, but not stupidly young and foolish.  I equally love the portrayals of Aramis and Porthos.
This is not a show intended for young audiences, at least as far as sexual content is concerned; definitely a teens' show.  Otherwise, this is a fantastic show!",1414454400,,827,4.63013698630137

6205171,5,B00HSKI8GS,"""The Musketeers"" is my favorite BBC show since ""Robin Hood.""

Casting was done beautifully. The Musketeers have a great, natural banter and easy chemistry. I could easily picture them being friends no matter where they found themselves. All of them have distinct personalities to set them apart AND they each have a great sense of humor and honor.

The story lines are not presented in quite as ""family friendly"" a manner as ""Robin Hood"" though. It is not vulgar at all, but there are a few scenes that are sexual in nature. No nakedness, but it's obvious there was some sex going on or about to commence. On a similar note, there is a hefty dose of mayhem and mischief. It helps to keep the plot light and the guys likable.

So excited for the next season!",1413244800,,757,4.510948905109489

It's BBC premier is scheduled for Feb 2015.  No premier date for America yet.  Highly recommended if you like good, old fashioned westerns.",1412985600,,378,4.651515151515151

I was hooked from the first ten minutes of the first episode and just fell in love with all of the characters and the actors that play them.  This is a very well done series and every actor does such a great job with their characters.  The personalities definitely come through.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the Alexandre Dumas book(s).,1412812800,,560,4.407766990291262

6205190,5,B00HSKI8GS,"This is probably the best representation of the Three Musketeers in over 30 years (the 1976 Richard Lester directed, being the best).  No, the story line is not representative of Dumas, yet it catches the spirit of adventure, and in an expanded universe for the errant rogues, it slowly expands Dumas's universe.

The Production values are top notch, costuming is amazing and the acting is very good.  Peter Capaldi, is oozing menace and salaciousness as Cardinal Riechilieu.  The female characters are strong and hold their own, in this  traditionally portrayed mans world.
This first season was so much fun, not only did I watch the episodes as they aired, and on demand, but I just had to own this.  Historical adventure on TV, done right.  Forget Reign...This is how it should be.",1412121600,,784,4.893939393939394
6205191,5,B00HSKI8GS,"The production quality is excellent, very good costuming, good writing, and great actors. If you were looking for media based on the three musketeers I assume the reason is because you like this genre, the bravado, swashbuckling, dueling, and intrigue kind of genre, and this show delivers just that in spades. If have an itch for Dumas flavored sword fighting look no further, you have found your show. If you don't like that genre then why were you searching for musketeer related media in the first place?

I am a Musketeer fan, but when I came across the BBC's series I became hooked to their version of the story and especially to those beautiful actors that play The Musketeers. They are masculine, tender, athletic, romantic, just great to watch and listen to them talk. Believe it or not I even like the evil Cardinal (that is crazy), he plays a great character. I also really like the character of Constance. This series has good writers - the dialogue is well done. If there were only fight scenes I would still be intrigued, the actors are great at their performances, but not only them, the director and editors do a great job at make this a great series. I bought the Blu-ray but could not wait for it to arrive that I also bought the digital copies to watch on Amazon Prime Video.

6205263,5,B00HSKI8GS,"I am a HUGE fan of the book series The Three Musketeers by A Dumas!  I have read all of the series - 5 books in total.

However, I have been disappointed by every movie I have seen that has attempted to portray these characters and their stories...until now!  It seems that so many movies portray these men as ridiculous and farcical.

This show portrays these characters in the true spirit of Dumas' writing.

WARNING - if you want the exact story line of the books, you may be disappointed.  The storylines are taken and adapted from Dumas, but again, because the stories are in line with the spirit and style of Dumas, I haven't minded at all.  It's like I am getting more adventures that Dumas didn't have time to share with us.

I have enjoyed this series tremendously, and it has spurred me to begin reading the books again!  If you have loved the characters in The Three Musketeers, you will enjoy this series.  And, if you haven't read past the first book, I encourage you to challenge yourself to about another 3,000 pages of reading (although I basically cried my way through The Man in the Iron Mask as it depicts the final days of the four friends as old men...all but one dies.  The book really has NOTHING to do with the man in the tower, so I never felt the title was correct - he is only a small part of the book...it's really about the end of their lives and adventures.  I will read all of them again except this one book).

I highly recommend this series if you love well-written scripts with action and adventure in a historical period.",1410652800,,1556,4.398601398601398

I read the Dumas books long ago and enjoyed every one of them.  The cast and crew have captured the author's work and carried it forward.  Whenever this series ends, I hope they will do the same with the Count of Monte Cristo.

We've now watched all of the first season and I read that a second season is in production.  Our review has not changed.  I did notice that the series does deviate from the original story, or so it appears, but it hasn't detracted from the original.

There is action, swashbuckling galore, romance, humor, bad guys, good guys, in-between guys, and, oh yes, all of those in female form as well.  If you can believe it, there is even reasonable historical accuracy!  The scripts are well-written, the plots thought out and believable.  The dialogue is snappy, natural and witty.

There are a number of themes and characters from the book that have not been in any of the movies, but there are also a number of things that are different from the book. It is a slightly different take, a more in depth take on the character than in the book, but it is a very well portrayed. If you haven't read the book, you will like the show even more.

It's taking place in the 1600's and they do recreate the atmosphere quite well. One of the muskeeters is black but that's ok because alexander dumas the guy who wrote the three musketeers was black also!.  this is one to watch with the whole family as well. It does have sexuality in it , but it's not directed in a lewd way.  Their isn't a bad episode either in this season. Peter Capaldi plays the lead villain here Cardinal R.

The character of  Athos is particularly well done by actor Tom Burke, the most believable 17th century characterization of the show and enjoyable to watch. Peter Capaldi  as Cardinal Richelieu is delightfully treacherous and cunning.

6205398,5,B00HSKI8GS,"The series started out slow, developing characters, revealing their pasts and how they got to this point in their lives, but with excellent displays of sword skills amidst a gorgeous background. Apparently it's filmed in the Czech Republic - some very beautiful country. The cast is remarkably talented: Tom Burke, as Athos, is I think my favorite - solid, thoughtful, and a realist most times, but damaged by his wife, who makes a nice villein; Santiago Cabrera as Aramis; Howard Charles as Porthos; Luke Pasqualino as D'Artagnan (the applicant for admission into The Musketeers) and Hugo Speer as their Captain Treville - I have grown attached to all of them, truly excellent actors in both serious moments and the absolute hilarious scenes that occur regularly. I love to hate the Cardinal and lately the king's mother. Ryan Gage is great as the king and his queen is developing nicely. The series has touched on a number of political and social issues of the time, notably the episode about educating women or not as the men wish. All in all this show is a real romp with bang up fight scenes, entertaining and subtle humor and wonderful character development.

6205402,5,B00HSKI8GS,"Though not typically a fan of programs or movies shot in an overall ""dark and dank"" format, but for this show it fits just fine. The director(s) is/are trying to recreate that dark nuance prevalent in this period of time (17th Century France). The actors (all new faces) and their acting is great as their on-screen chemistry is undeniable! You cannot buy or construct chemistry....this show has it in spades.
That said, the stories are a little too compressed, too neat and clean but quite enjoyable nonetheless. I would love to see a more BBC or PBS-esque technique of 1:30+ run-time to allow deeper story lines. Each actor is given the lead each week and the others support...it is a nice round-robin cast. Overall very enjoyable and I look forward to each episode. For those not familiar or less familiar with this period of time in history, it is a good way to see how the politics, the church and the stark separation of the (have's and the have not's) was and in many cases, still is.",1408665600,5,991,4.604519774011299

6205456,2,B00HSKI8GS,"I had high hopes for this show, since I love all the books in Dumas' Musketeer series, and I still read them once a year or so. Sadly, the BBC seems to be learning Hollywood's worst lessons and substituting leather, manscaping and bewbs for plot, characters and writing. It's too bad really, because the actors are doing their best. If the show had stuck to the book more closely I really would have loved to see Peter Capaldi as the Cardinal. Instead we got Xena with muskets and mustaches. :(",1407801600,8,494,4.5
6205457,2,B00HSKI8GS,"Although other reviewers seem to disagree, I did not find this show to be true to the spirit of the original Dumas.  Yes, there is action, a bit of humor, sex, and political intrigue, but the 3 musketeers all seem to have the same character.  Athos is not respectable/dependable/truthful to Treville and Aramis and not religious or reserved.  Mostly, they all seem to be Porthos, but less fun and less funny.  Also, the Cardinal is portrayed as a selfish bad guy, making harmful decisions, rather than the evil villain/statesman of Dumas' books.

These problems are a pity.  Their correction would add a lot of depth to the show.  It is good for action, and if you are not overly attached/familiar with the original novels, then I think you will enjoy it.

In order to fill multiple seasons, the producers needed to add side stories to the mythos. Some of the stories work better than others but overall the show works. The casting was well done despite caving to the PC demographic. There are plenty of action scenes and enough character development for you to care about the characters.

It will be interesting to see what direction the show goes in it's second season.",1407024000,,701,4.691056910569106
6205521,3,B00HSKI8GS,"I truly love this show. I like  the action, the costumes and the actors. However, in the third episode they had to show their political correctness and mope about the horrors of the day. I watched episode four and it was back to easy cheerful self. However, I will cease
paying for the program if they dip into preaching instead of entertaining again.",1407024000,,351,4.571428571428571
6205522,5,B00HSKI8GS,"As a child, D'artagnan was my third literary love--after Peter Pan and Mowgli--and I read all six of Dumas's books with the four musketeers, although at that age, I didn't understand all the political intrigue as yet.  However, the four musketeers have continued to be among my favorite literary characters, and I'll watch any show that attempts to bring them to life.  This series attempts to fill in some of the gaps from the book.  After all, Dumas leaves several years rather blank with the simple words--""They rose about eight o'clock in winter, about six in summer, and went to take the orderly word and see how things were going on at M. Treville's--and this sentence gives some creative license for this new adaptation to use.  No, it is not ""real"" to the actual book, but I believe the writers have, as some other reviewers have stated, been ""true"" to the characters as Dumas drew them.  All four male actors play their parts wonderfully well, and although sometimes it is difficult to see Constance as a redhead, the actress plays her role with the vigor and intelligence that the book portrays.  Although the episodes are full of intrigue and swordplay, for me, I watch and re-watch and will continue to watch because the actors and the writers are able to recreate these characters with humor and passion and endless consideration for one another, just as Dumas did when he labeled them ""the inseparables.""",1407024000,9,1418,4.814814814814815

This entertaining series captures the look of 18th century France combined with all the intrigue surrounding the crown. Throughout each episode there is the recurrent theme of the Musketeers loyalty to each other no matter what they must endure.  Each actor that portrays a Musketeer does a fine job in capturing his spirit, but for me the evil Cardinal steals the show!! As for the woman, there are a few surprises; good and evil was never lovelier!!  Hopefully this little gem will come back for a second season, but for now I will watch every episode of season 1.",1406678400,2,667,4.833333333333333

6205546,5,B00HSKI8GS,"Marvelous entertainment on every level.  We're in a new golden age of television now, especially for fans of sci-fi, fantasy, and historical drama.  And this show with its great production values and seductive cast, is outstanding for the more playful and fun approach it takes to historical romance.  It's light, fast paced,  and beautifully done. Of course the older Musketeers movies always delivered comedy as well as action, but this version  is just serious enough and intelligent enough to make the wit and humor all the more appealing.  The violence and inevitable cruelty of the period is never overdone, and moments of triumph often depend not on brutality  but on cleverness.  The villains or antagonists --- Milady de Winter and Cardinal Richelieu --- are quite complex and truly interesting characters, and that adds considerable depth to the whole offering.  I am delighted that a second season is in the works.  ---  For some one who grew up in the forties and fifties as I did, reveling in Errol Flynn movies like ""Captain Blood,"" ""Robin Hood,"" or ""The Sea Hawk,"" this is a great treat.  It's entirely safe for an audience that might find the gore of ""Game of Thrones"" too much, and the sadism of ""The Borgias"" simply overwhelming.  ""The Musketeers"" is not striving to be as serious as those and other shows, yet at the same time the sets, costumes, and the cinematography are superb, the writing is consistently excellent, and the use of historical figures is extremely well done.  Every episode is profoundly  emotionally satisfying.  Highly recommended.",1406419200,148,1572,5.011583011583012
6205547,3,B00HSKI8GS,"So we have a series based on a French novel set in Paris yet every actor, from major to minor, speaks with a British accent.  These are very capable actors so you'd think someone could have come up with a passable French accent.  The said, it's a fun series in the vein of Merlin where the source material takes a far back seat.  The actors playing Porthos, Athos, Aramis and D'Artagnan are quite good in their roles and you can tell they're having a good time.  Overall, it's a good if not great series.  Good enough that I'll watch a few more episodes to see how it turns out.",1406332800,,578,4.26605504587156

They managed to do a fantastic job with this new take on The MUSKETEERS,This is one of my favorite classics, It is action packed with out being gory or inappropriate for family viewing( not sure what it is rated).However, i am much less sensitive about violence on film than most of my friends, so you may want to judge for yourself before you sit down to watch with the kids.
And MON DIEU  they really picked the right actors for the Musketeers! Especially d'Artagnon- OOH La La!!
Also liked the period costumes and that  the producers  tried to recreate the atmosphere of 17th century France.
