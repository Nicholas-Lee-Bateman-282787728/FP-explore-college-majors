8411164,1,B000G97QCA,"I am just starting to learn to slackline, and had see this video at REI.  It was a big disappointment, though.  A good chunk of the video is dedicated to cool tricks, which are fun to see, but they're cheaper on youtube!  In addition, I bought a Gibbon slackline that is ready to set up, so the ""setup"" part of the DVD was not very helpful (they use webbing, not a ready kit).  I also found that the ""how to"" portion was somewhat lacking.  The five minute video I watched on Gibbon's Facebook page on Slacklining 101 was much more helpful.  I was really excited that this DVD might talk about ""moving meditation"" as I've been learning to meditate as well.  Meditation wasn't mentioned one single time, nor was there any instruction.  I would suggest just digging into youtube for free advice and tips rather than spend any money on this DVD.",1280102400,5,841,4.4868421052631575
