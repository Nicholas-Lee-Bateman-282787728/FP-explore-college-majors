2910148,5,B000TUDFE4,"For the last few years, the VeggieTales have been hit-or-miss (Gideon:Tuba Warrior was a hit; Moe & the Big Exit was a miss).  I'm happy to say that The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's is a hit.  Phil Vischer is in fine form here, writing a touching and funny version of the Prodigal Son story.  Also, ""Monkey"" is instantly one of the all-time greatest silly songs!  If you're a Veggie fan you've already got this title.  If you're not ... this is a great place to start!",1191715200,7,464,4.348837209302325
2910149,5,B000TUDFE4,"I've been a fan of Veggie Tales since long before I had kids.  In fact, when I got married and became the dad of 2 kids, I had more Veggie Tales videos than both kids combined! Since then, most Veggie Tales releases have really impressed me - but there have been a couple of weak ones. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed with the Lord of the Beans, but this new one, The Wizard of Ha's, renewed my faith in Bob and Larry!! The 3D rendering, textures, and animation have really improved with this release as well.

The way the Big Idea gang takes the story of the Prodigal Son and combines it with the Wizard of Oz is priceless! From Mr. Lunt's Scarecrow to the whirling tornado scene on the way to Ha's, the keen Wizard of Oz fan will not be disappointed. Stay tuned for a memorable rendition of ""Somewhere over the rainbow"" during the credits. My wife is a Big Idea Ambassador, so they send us preview copies of each video, that's how I've seen this one so early. Keep up the good works, Big Idea!

PS: Bonus points if you detect the obscure Star Wars reference!",1191628800,6,1068,4.33
2910150,5,B000TUDFE4,"They children love this movie, but I've watch it as well and there might be a thing or two I'm a bit on the fence with, but overall it a excellent kiss film, teaches good bible value and lesson of the lord.",1488758400,,206,3.9285714285714284

Veggietales always takes a Biblical story, makes it child-friendly through updated scenery, characters, songs and fun but they don't compromise good morals, good character and good choices in doing so.  As a parent I always feel comfortable putting on Veggietales because I know there will be no inappropriate language or content - something increasingly difficult to find in movies.

Bright colors and funny skits keep them entertained while they learn something about the history of the bible and about proper human interactions (even though they are vegetables).

2910252,5,B000TUDFE4,What better way to teach children about our current political environment then to watch this.

2910253,5,B000TUDFE4,"I was questionable about this one because the tale of the Prodigal Son is so short and how can you stretch it out and be as meaningful as the story. Well, Big Idea Productions did a fantastic with this one.

The story starts out what Darby (Jr. Asparagus) wants to have fun at Ha's (an amusement park) outside of the farm (think Over The Rainbow from Wizard of Oz). On his journey there he runs into three other characters Mr. Lunt as Scarecrow, Larry as Tin Man, and Pa Grape as Lion. They all end up at the Land of Ha's and Darby then realizes what is really important in life.

This is a must have if you love the VeggieTales bunch and their moral stories. Another new addition to add from Big Idea is Pistachio (the parallel story to Pinocchio)",1359158400,,748,4.297872340425532

As a parent, I didn't feel that it captured the point of the Prodigal Son narrative.  Other Veggie Tales offerings are much better on average.  I still give it three stars because it is clean, and it does have some good songs.

However, just from listening to it, I have enjoyed a few giggles myself and someday plan to watch the movie visually too.  The jokes are great and genius spinoffs of the real Wizard of Oz movie. The length of the DVD is perfect, because I do not want my son watching shows the entire ride.  He does not mind watching it twice and then having it turned off. I tried to shut it off after one viewing and got screams....I guess he likes the movie too.  Whenever the monkey and ape song comes on we have a little dance party in the car :)

The ""Veggie-Tales"" series not only has strong Christianity themes, but is also anti-vegetarian (or pro-meat) and shows the ""veggies"" eating meat products, very confusing for kids as they are growing up trying to make good eating choices and understanding where meat comes from and of course that vegetables do NOT eat meat would be a good start.

As a vegetarian family, we received it as a present from a well-wishing relative, but I was shocked when I saw it with my kids- it needs to be clearly labeled.",1312156800,7,648,4.734513274336283

You don't have to be Religious to enjoy the show. Sometimes I find myself laughing harder than my kids. ""The Wonderful Wizard of Ha's"" is a new classic!

As always, filled with funny twists and puns; Splenda, the good witch; Dorothy/Darby's family farm is a Floss farm (what better for a farm run by vegetables!); and the Wicked ""Witch"" has a chorus of misguided minions/onions.

2910293,5,B000TUDFE4,"So, can I just tell you that the Veggie Tales Rock? We just recently purchased this DVD and my kids, 6, 4, & 2 have watched it no less than 50 times. We've traveled between states the last two weeks, and the kids watched this in the car. The second this DVD is over my kids yell, CAN YOU START IT AGAIN? I am telling you, they watch it 3 or 4 times in a row. I have only heard it while driving and have not even been able to watch it, yet, and I laugh the whole way through. They jokes are so funny, and my kids don't even realize where they come from, ('Tin man. Rusted!') So funny!
I personally am not uber-religious, but I am determined to raise my childred to be good people, and always to be kind and think about the consequences of their actions, and effects on others, and these videos each have several good lessons in them that the kids don't even realize they are learning. We also have some really good conversations about WHY things are happening in the movies, which sparks my kids to think, which is always my main goal. The Veggie Tales movies do that. They teach kindness and understanding, and my kids really think about what is happening and why, even my two year old has verbally expressed positive messages from the movies.
I can't say enough about these movies. These are a definite buy. If you have young children and are looking for another way to help them understand the importance of kindness towards others, and any other life lessons, these are excellent tools...and funnier than heck for you to watch, too.
And for the less 'religious' types, but 'I am still a good person' types, like myself, who have found themselves a little lost in the whole religion shuffle, you should know that these are not sickly 'dripping' with religous gobbledy gook.(No offense to any religions, people, or races here, whatsoever!) But these DVDs have simple lessons, with a bible verse thrown in at the end that actually help in the undertanding, in a very nonthreatening, non pushy way - and trust me, if it was pushy, I would feel it...
As I said before, my children are 6, 4, & 2, and they all love this DVD enough to watch over and over, literally, once it ends, they watch it again. I highly recommend this DVD, and I hope this review was helpful!",1193011200,45,2262,4.413875598086125

2910297,5,B000TUDFE4,"Veggie Tales has been doing it the right way all along, and that's God's way! Phil Vischer once had his setbacks, and he wasn't afraid to admit that in his book. The Muppets have always been misguided, yet put on a good show. The Muppets out-did themselves with ""Muppet Christmas Carol,"" and ""Muppet Treasure Island."" Then they got the brilliant idea to do ""Wizard of Oz."" That should've been the best Muppets ever, right? HA!! I don't think so. It was pathetic! In fact, if my daughter wouldn't have gotten up in the middle of it to play, I would've turned it off and said, ""NUH-UH! We ain't watching this crap!"" Well, it was just a few weeks ago that we learned that Veggie Tales had attempted ""Oz,"" and turned it into, ""The Wizard of Ha's. Ok, Big Idea, you've got my attention. The story deals with The Prodigal Son. Now I know that this isn't just something that will be great, it will be something very special. Anybody else who guessed this would be special was right on the money! I loved it!

So, getting down to the story. Darby (Junior) is the son of a simple dental floss farmer. He gets wind of something pretty cool. The Wonderful Land of Ha's, where they have the coolest stuff, and you can do whatever you want. Dad simply says, ""Not this time, son. The floss comes first."" And without giving much away, Darby says, ""Oh yeah? I think I come first this time!"" So he sets out with his ""dog,"" Tutu, and they go for the fun!! And of course, they meet a scarecrow, (Mr. Lunt) a tin man, (Larry) and a lion (Pa Grape) who scares them at first. Hey, you want to go on the roller coaster or get some cotton candy, Darby's paying the way! So what happens when you enter Ha's? You have a blast!!! But what happens when you run out of cash? HMM! Is daddy so stupid after all?

I'm here to tell you that this is special. The songs hit home every time. The silly song, ""Monkey,"" just hits the funny-bone, and you just shake your head and laugh! The lessons in this are not just for our little ones. We can learn a lesson from Darby, because whether we admit it or not, we've all felt like Darby. And in the end, we've all wanted to just go home and beg for forgiveness, and that's because we felt so unworthy. But guess what? Your father might have other ideas. Our Heavenly Father certainly had other ideas, and He said, ""I KNOW you are worth it!!"" There's no place like home! Watch this, and you'll believe that. You'll know that we are indeed a special people, and God's just waiting with open arms!! Thank you so much, Veggie Tales!",1192060800,2,2539,4.331932773109243
2910298,5,B000TUDFE4,"Larry the Cucumber has a problem.  He's broken something of his dad's.  In fact, he's considering running away from home so he doesn't have to face his dad.  Fortunately, Bob the Tomato has a solution for him, our story for this episode.

In Kansas, Darby (Jr. Asparagus) is bored with life on his father's floss farm.  He wants to go to Ha's, an amusement park in the area.  When his father says they can't go, Darby runs away with his pig, er dog, Tutu.  But before he gets far, he is swept up and taken to Munchieland.  From there, he sets out to follow Yellow McToad to Ha's, along the way making friends with a Scarecrow (Mr. Lunt), a Tin Man (Larry the Cucumber), and a Lion (Pa Grape).  But what will happen when he runs out of money?  Will his father forgive him?

We also get a new silly song, ""Monkey.""  By the time it is over, you will definitely know the difference between a monkey and an ape.  Just don't take it as far as Larry does.

I guessed that Phil Vischer wrote this episode, and I was right.  This is an absolutely hilarious show.  Many of the jokes will probably go over the heads of the intended audience.  In fact, they will go over the heads of anyone who hasn't seen the movie version of Wizard of Oz.  Even the songs are spoofs of the songs from that movie.  But if you have seen the film, the puns will constantly crack you up.  There is only the one story in this episode, but trust me, there's enough going on for 50 minutes.  They even introduce a few potential new characters.

Even with the spoof of Oz, the story also tells the story of the Prodigal Son.  Not sure how that works?  Trust me, the two actually work very well together.  And the ultimate moral is that God loves us very much.  Nothing new for the Veggies, but a great new way to remind us.

So if you're like me and anxiously await every video the VeggieCrew gives us, rest assured you will love this installment.",1191888000,55,1913,4.270949720670391
2910299,5,B000TUDFE4,"In this latest story from the people at Big Idea, the VeggieTale gang takes on the parable of the prodigal son by parodying THE WIZARD OF OZ.  At the beginning of the segment, Larry is fretting about having broken his father's toy water buffalo and what his reaction will be.  Later Bob reads a letter from a viewer who is afraid that God will no longer love him because of the things he has done in life.  Thus Bob begins the tale of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF HA'S.  The story follows young Darby O'Gill (another shout out to the folks at Disney) as portrayed by Junior Asparagus.  Darby lives on a dental floss farm with his father.  Times have been tough and they are having difficulties bringing in the crop.  Darby really wants to go to a new amusement park that has just opened up, The Land of Ha's.  His father explains that they just don't have the money.  Darby insists that he can go with the money that his father has been saving for him, but his father reminds Darby that that money is for his future.  Feeling alone and deprived, Darby takes the money and sneaks out of the house with his pet pig, Tutu.  As they make their way to the park, a Kansas tornado comes through.  They seek shelter in a small trailer that is lifted off the ground by the twister.  After a flying cow and Mary Poppins fly by, the trailer eventually crashes in a world that looks like the board game Candy Land.  It is Munchy Land.  Greeted by the Munchies and the fairy Splenda Sweet (Madame Blueberry), Darby and Tutu set out to visit the Land of Ha's by following a giant Scottish amphibian, Yellow McToad.  Only the way they meet a scarecrow (Mr. Lunt), a tin man (Larry), and a lion (Grandpa Grape).  The strange entourage makes its way through a field of puppies until they reach the Land of Ha's and meet the Wizard (Archibald Asparagus).  They ride the rides and eat the junk food and have a great time.  But frivolities don't last if you don't have the cash, as Darby and his friends soon discover and Darby finds himself at the bottom of a garbage dump.

The main story is broken up by a Silly Song with Larry.  The song is entitled ""If It Doesn't Have a Tail, It's Not a Monkey.""  It involves Larry and Bob on a jungle sight-seeing trip looking for monkeys and not apes.

Overall, this is a very enjoyable VeggieTales episode.  This is only one of two VeggieTales that Phil Vischer, co-creator of VeggieTales has written since loosing the rights to VeggieTales a few years ago to bankruptcy.  Vischer always did write good material with stories that flowed smoothly.  THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF HA'S is another great example of this.  Including the intermission of the Silly Song with Larry, THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF HA'S clocks in near fifty minutes.  Stick around through the credits for a bonus of Mr. Lunt singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow.""  A great video for children and for fans of VeggieTales, especially those who like THE WIZARD OF OZ.",1191715200,19,2941,4.496226415094339
