8069784,4,B0009XT8PG,"Enjoyed the simplicity of the movie along with the comedy. Comparing comedy from  decades past compared to current comedy, I'll take the decades old comedy any day, there is no worry about cursing, subjective sexual remarks etc. Thank you Amazon for streaming the old pre-1950's movies.  I only wish there were more ""westerns"" to choose from.",1483401600,,342,5.089285714285714

8069792,3,B0009XT8PG,"Yep, nazi spies have infiltrated the Great Smokey Mountains, and only turnip-nosed, Snuffy Smith can stop them! He's -somehow- made it into the army, and is -somehow- stationed near his fellow hillbillies. The spies are up to no good, but have no fear! Snuffy -somehow- winds up inside a top secret rocket! Sound ludicrous? Well, if the title, HILLBILLY BLITZKRIEG, isn't enough of a tip-off, there's just no hope! Inane, harmless fun, from a time long before irony and / or cynicism became the norm...",1470528000,,502,4.91764705882353
