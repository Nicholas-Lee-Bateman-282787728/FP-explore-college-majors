2405161,4,B000B7HY06,It's a very good story with actors who play their parts very well. I enjoyed Richard Boone's portrial of the tough captain.,1363478400,,123,4.636363636363637
2405162,5,B000B7HY06,Want a western you can get your girlfriend to watch with you? Well Richard Boone famous for playing Paladin in Have Gun Will Travel (Hey Hollywood time for a remake) and villans in John Wayne movies gives the performance of his career as the old tired fort commander out in the middle of nowhere with no chance of transfer or promotion. And young heartthrobs George Hamilton (before his tan) and Richard (Dr. Kildare) Chamberland provide the eye candy for the ladies. New generation this one is a sleeper at an excellent amazon price!!,1343692800,9,535,4.763440860215054
2405163,5,B000B7HY06,"A Thunder of Drums is another film I saw as a kid.  I remember enjoying it then and seeing it so many years later, it still holds up.  Richard Boone is the hard-as-nails commander of an army fort in the middle of nowhere and the indians are on the warpath.  No one played this type of role better than Boone and his performance is reminescent of his performance as Sam Houston in John Wayne's The Alamo and Boone's later performance in the hard-bitten western Rio Conchos.  Assigned to the fort is a new Lieutenant played by a young (and surprisingly good) George Hamilton.  Boone has a history with Hamilton's General father and takes an instant dislike to him.  There is also a silly subplot about Hamilton's ex-fiancee who also just happens to be at the fort engaged to another young Lieutenant.
The supporting cast is excellent including a young Richard Chamberlain, right before attaining fame as Dr. Kildare, Charles Bronson as an uncouth and obnoxious trooper, Arthur O'Connell as a grizzled old sergeant and the great Slim Pickens in an early role.
The film ends with a terrific confrontation between the cavalry and the indians.
The picture on this disk is clear and very good, the colors vibrant.  The sound is fine as well.
If you want an exciting and enjoyable cavalry vs indians western with an excellent performance by Richard Boone, then you will greatly enjoy this film.",1309651200,28,1386,4.7740585774058575
2405164,3,B000B7HY06,"In this 1961 Western ,George Hamilton -playing a grittier than usual role -is Lieutenant Curtis McQuade ,a newly commissioned officer whose father is a general .He is posted ,along with 2 other new officers ,to a remote frontier outpost commanded by Captain Maddox (Richard Boone)a man bearing both physical and emotional scars from previous battles against the rampaging Apaches whose depradations keep the undermanned garrison fully occupied .McQuade is viewed with thinly disguised contempt by Maddox and his men who see  his appointment as neptotism and he ,literally, has to fight his own men  to win their respect .He gets his big chance to ""win his spurs "" and prove himself worthy of his father's name when the tribes go on a particularly bloody rampage.

This is tough and gritty movie ,with lots of action and some rich colour photography .The performances are uniformly good with Boone in particular giving a fine portrait as a man stretched to the limits by a tough and thankless posting .Veteran Western actors Arthur O'Connell and Slim Pickens give their usual idiosyncratic performances as cavalrymen while Charles Bronson gives a forceful performance as a trooper. Star spotters will notice Richard Chamberlain and pop guitarist Duane Eddy both making their debuts in supporting roles
The only slight let down is the script by James Warner Bellah .Its's not that it is bad but it does compare unfavourably with the stories he wrote that provided the basis for the loose trilogy of Cavalry movies which John Ford directed -Fort Apache ,She Wore A Yellow Ribbon ,and Rio Grande

This is well made and lively and should be enjoyed by devotees of the Western and anybody who enjoys good professional movie making",1193356800,29,1724,5.03859649122807

2405183,4,B000B7HY06,"One of Richard Boone's best performances. The story is pretty basic with a young army officer (George Hamilton) learning the ropes, while an underlying cloud of resentment lies within his superior. Some unholy romance involved, but the main theme is military in nature. Strong supporting cast. I've elected to watch this movie several times. Each of the primary characters are portrayed well. Well worth a look, though probably deemed more of a ""guy"" flick.",1476921600,4,457,5.1891891891891895

2405202,3,B000B7HY06,"This movie was a bit of a disappointment. A lot of talk and not much action. Richard Boone does his usual professional job and it was interesting to see Charles Bronson in a supporting role, but the action usually found in this genre was just not there.",1412985600,,253,4.404255319148936

2405204,4,B000B7HY06,"gritty, realistic, pretty good acting.

The storyline and sound are good - could have done without some of the romance. Video is a bit grainy, but what do expect for < 10 bucks.

Don't know if representation of American Indian information is factual, bot it's realistic and you don't see this in other westerns. I think Hamilton overplayed his part whereas Boone was spot on. Too bad there wasn't a sequel/pre-sequel. Music is very good especially at the opening. Wished the movie was longer with more engagements with the indians and more of Chamberlain.

There are no subtitles. Aspect is 1.73. Sound is Dolby.",1405296000,3,612,4.865384615384615
2405205,3,B000B7HY06,"The movie, overall, is a very good cavalry western.  Richard Boone makes the movie.  Otherwise, the plot is thin and it would be just an average Saturday afternoon oater.",1399939200,2,170,4.827586206896552

2405207,4,B000B7HY06,"Liked the movie; esp. for the grittiness that Mr. Richard Boone brings to the character he plays.  One can feel the contrast portrayed between he and the greenhorn first officer, McQuade. Accountability at the end of the day is the lesson that McQuade finally learns. A fitting ending.",1379030400,,285,4.9375

Best : Richard Boone & George Hamilton.
Worst: Charles Bronson. Wanted something Nasty to happen to him.
  Understood the Romance,no objection to that part of the plot. Loved Boones Tagline.
Bachelor's make the Best Soldiers,All they have to Lose is their Loneliness GRIT is targeted at guys.
I'm not one & Love the Free Channel,especially for the  Westerns. Now this one is Added to my Tell Everybody about it Favorites. Wish I could've watched it with Late Parents.

8082967,2,B000B7HY06,"This is a disappointing western.  It had potential, if not in the  plot which is the standard lonely cavalry outpost with hostile  Indians, than with a decent cast, but it never got off the ground.  Way too much personal drama with the ""love triangle"" and not enough action.  Slim Pickens was wasted in a small role while Charles Bronson's character came off as a giggling no-count.  Richard Boone was marginal as the angry captain and Richard Chamberlain had a very small role as a somewhat incompetent lieutenant.  I don't know why Duane Eddy was there--all he did was walk around strumming a guitar or toting a bugle.  It was slow, slow, s! ow and seemed a lot longer than 97 minutes and didn't really get moving (and that's being generous) until the final 15 minutes.

If you want to watch a good cavalry vs. indians movie check out The Command and pass on this one.",1480896000,2,870,4.561290322580645
8082968,4,B000B7HY06,I strongly like the movie; but I am concerned that the notes didn't indicate that it may or may not play in a computer DVD drive; Something that is important to me.,1480464000,,164,4.15625
8082969,5,B000B7HY06,A Thunder Of Drums was released in 1961. A fine western with a touch of soap opera and romance. Interesting to see Richard Chamberlain in a role early in his career. Fans of Richard Chamberlain will like this the most.,1479945600,,218,4.475
