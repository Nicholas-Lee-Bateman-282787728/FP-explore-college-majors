6284663,4,B00IP965IO,"""Rawhide: The Eighth And Final Season)
(CBS/Paramount DVD, 2014)
. . . .

The 1965 season of CBS's popular western drama ""Rawhide"" proved to be the last; the previous year saw the show's original lead actor Eric Fleming, who played ""trail boss"" Gil Favor, quit the show to pursue a film career, leaving it up to co-star Clint Eastwood to fill the gap. Eastwood was certainly up for the challenge, as he had been slowly stealing focus from Fleming for several years, and in Season Eight his character, Rowdy Yates, officially became the trail boss of the show's never-ending cattle drives.

The change-up gave Eastwood a change to flex his muscles as an actor, and trail boss Yates takes on more of the laconic, icy cool demeanor that Eastwood made his trademark in the Dirty Harry films and beyond. This too-cool attitude doesn't always match up with Yates as we had seen him before: when he was the cattle crew's ramrod, or second in command, Yates was often portrayed as youthful and impetuous, but now that he's the boss, Yates is always cool and collected, an old hand who never makes the wrong play. It's one of several elements that throw the show slightly off-balance, along with several major casting changes.

In addition to losing Eric Fleming, most of the show's cast changed, leaving only Eastwood and a couple of other veterans in the lineup. The new group never quite coheres, although hot-tempered John Ireland and stolid Raymond St. Jacques emerges as capable foils for the new Rowdy Yates. The new cast is joined by numerous guest stars and enjoyable character actors. Particularly notable are Claude Akins, Robert Blake, Charles Bronson, Rip Torn and Warren Oates, along with delightfully over-the-top performances by John Drew Barrymore (Drew's now-obscure father) and a young Bruce Dern, who both make a great slimy bad-guy.

Even though by 1965 most prime-time shows were switching to color, this show was still handsomely filmed in finely-detailed black-and-white... It was probably just a cost-cutting move for a show that was on the chopping block, but it gives the final season a classy feel, even in episodes that sometimes feel a little slapdash, and it's nice that the entire show -- all eight seasons -- have the same look and feel. Occasionally they tried some artsy cinematography, particularly on the season's first episode, ""Encounter At Boot Hill,"" which was one of two episodes directed by Sutton Roley, who later worked on the stylish private-eye drama, ""Mannix."" It's all crazy camera angles and wild editing, emblematic of the ongoing changes in '60s pop culture (although the rest of the season takes a more conventional approach.) The other Sutton Roley-directed episode is ""Duel At Daybreak,"" a season highpoint in which Eastwood and Bronson square off in a taut, tense drama.

In short, this last season is still worth a spin. It's solid old-school television, and while the show may have lost some momentum after Season Seven, fans of the show will still want to check it out, if for no other reason than to see Rowdy Yates riding high in the saddle.

6284664,4,B00IP965IO,"Fellow Rawhide fans, I just bought Rawhide-The Eighth and Final Season tonight at my local Walmart store for $19.96.

Although I've spent thousands of dollars buying from amazon over the past 15 years, they don't always have the best deal. And they sure didn't on this release, or the two Rawhide Season 7 sets issued earlier this year.

The episodes are in B & W.  I'm watching the first episode now on DVD and the clarity is excellent.  Although a lot of fans don't like this final (half) season, I have always enjoyed most of the episodes. It's a different Rawhide from the previous seasons for sure, but still a good western television series that beats a lot of the competition.  Just look at this final season as bonus episodes filmed without Eric Fleming (who is missed), or even cattle in a few episodes, and you'll enjoy it as a supplement to the other years.  Clint Eastwood is still there, and Steve Raines and Paul Brinegar, plus we now have a few new, interesting  drovers in Raymond St. Jacques and John Ireland to get to know. They're good actors, mostly good riders too although Ireland looks a little stiff on horseback.  St. Jacques fits in perfectly with the veteran cast members from his first appearance, but Ireland never seems comfortable in the role.  James Gregory appears in one of the early episodes and would have been a better fit as a regular cast member.  Even though it's hit and miss, I still enjoy most of this season's episodes.

Just wanted to post this review so hope you can save some money by checking Walmart or another source if amazon keeps the price too high.  Good luck!",1401753600,20,1614,4.604895104895105
6284665,4,B00IP965IO,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous brilliantly astute reviewer, Rawhide is just begging for color.  And with the perfect methods of colorization today (please b/w nuts, stop judging today's beautifully colorized TV and movies by 30 year old technology efforts, get over ""Way Out West"" from '82 already, today's technology is perrifict.) Rawhide would look fantastic in beautiful living colorization.  Make my dreams come true, while your at it and colorize Honeymooners, I Love Lucy, & re-colorized Laurel & Hardy using today's perfect color technology.

By the way, season 8 is a very enjoyable last ride with Rowdy and the boys.  Anyone buying will not be sorry except for the fact it's not colorized, of course.
Thank you so kindly.",1401667200,,741,5.15

6284668,3,B00IP965IO,"With the exception of the episode Duel At Daybreak, this 8th and final season of Rawhide is a lackluster production. New producer Ben Brady fired all the regulars except Rowdy, Quince, and Wishbone, and replaced them with actors who never develop in these 13 episodes. The stories are mostly not up to the standards of the previous 7 seasons, and the sketched credits look like mock ups of ones from The Wild Wild West. By the autumn of 1965, CBS was color casting most of its sitcoms (Gilligan's Island, My Favorite Martian, Petticoat Junction, Hogan's Heroes, etc), so it was a huge oversight not to film Rawhide in color. Rawhide is the 5th longest running western, and the only one in the top 5 never to have had an episode in color.",1394409600,41,737,4.590909090909091

6284672,3,B00IP965IO,"I have all the first 7 season RH dvds  and have now watched season 8. I have mixed feelings , as far as the stories go. A couple were pretty good, a couple pretty boring. The biggest problem is that the dynamic between the senior experienced trail boss and his younger sometimes impetuous ramrod is gone, but I think they might have been able to over come that, had they not gutted the remainder of the cast. Wishbone has very little to do this season, other than defend his coffee, but it actually makes sense he's not jawing with the men much, because he has no cook's louse to harangue and to help him with chores. We know nothing about the new drovers--Simon, Jed, Ian--they come and go, with no explanation of who they are and what there position is with the drive. And the other drovers are just blank faces with no personalities. Over the preceding seasons, viewers came to know Pete, Mushy, Hey Soos, Joe Scarlet even Clay, Toothless and Narbo..now they are gone and its a new crew that I have no interest in. I think Clint Eastwood is a terrific actor, and I think they probably could have carried on a bit longer with him taking over from Gil Favor, who retired, or got killed in a stampede or something, as long as he had familiar faces around him, and perhaps they added an impetuous new guy in Ramrod role. I happen to love Jim Quince, but impetuous and eager to learn he is not. As it happens, I suspect RH fans were tuning in to season 8 and finding they just didn't care any more .",1466899200,4,1497,4.327402135231317

6284687,4,B00IP965IO,"I remember watching Rawhide on Friday nights and realizing it was over when the series was moved to Tuesday nights against Combat.  Sure enough, after four months Rawhide was gone.  Since I did watch Combat, I had never seen the last 4 months of shows, until now...
Reading many of the negative reviews, I was expecting the worst.  However the episodes I have seen have been no better or worse than what went before.
To be honest, I was never that impressed with Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates, preferring Eric Fleming's trail boss, Gil Favor.  However, Fleming left the series to make movies, (a poor decision that wound up causing his death,) and Eastwood became the sole star of the show.  Clint does a credible job as the series lead.  The one bit of casting I have difficulty with is John Ireland as drover Jed Colby.  Somehow he just doesn't seem right  (despite the fact that one of Ireland's earliest film roles was in Howard Hawks' epic cattle-drive saga ""Red River."")
As stated, the episodes I have seen have been fine.  Of particular interest is an episode entitled ""Duel at Daybreak"" featuring guest star Charles Bronson in an absolutely vile role.  It is interesting to see him and Eastwood face each other, knowing that 10 years after this show was produced they would become the biggest motion picture action.stars.  Somehow I doubt that they could have possibly known.
My only vague criticism is that the great Rawhide theme is not played over the end credits.  Otherwise, I have no major problem with this set.",1411257600,3,1526,4.738636363636363

don't get me wrong I'm a Clint Eastwood fan got every film he was ever in
what I like to say is the late Eric Fleming was with out doubt the beast lead actor by far and was shadowed on most dvd covers ? !
I properly belong to last of generations born myself 1959 for this type of show to enjoy to the fullest and others like bonanza ez.........

6284694,4,B00IP965IO,"The main reason to get this season is that this is the last appearance of Eastwood in his prime in a TV series , these episodes haven't been seen in almost 50 years, so it is worth the investment, just for this reason alone.

 In this season, he is the leading star for the only time in a TV series, 13 all new episodes, his portrayal as Rowdy Yates is much more gritty, tougher and heroic than all of his previous seasons of Rawhide. And the stories are action packed.

Eastwood is the main reason for the popularity of the western genre today, his depiction as The Man With No Name, in the spaghetti westerns of the late 60's regenerated an interest in westerns that has lasted until today.

Along with Eastwood, we had James Arness as Matt Dillon, the best western character ever in the best TV series ever, and we're only half way through these releases, with season 10 coming this summer. We also had Fess Parker as Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone, these have already been released, Guy Williams as Zorro, who was also a regular in season 5 of Bonanza as cousin Will Cartwright, and Chuck Conners as The Rifleman. Unfortunately, the western genre hasn't been too successful in recent years with the releases of movies such as Jonah Hex and The Lone Ranger, but at least we can look forward to more seasons of Gunsmoke and Bonanza, though with the departure of Adam, ie Pernell Roberts, it seems that future releases of Bonanza will be slow to come.

So Clint Eastwood is the main reason to get this set, his portrayal as Rowdy Yates is much like the anti-hero characters that he established in his movies which followed",1404432000,2,1623,4.525597269624574
