8030895,4,B0002RQOUG,"This is a wonderful DVD for any lighthouse lover. But be forewarned that it is a DVD-R disc, NOT a commercially pressed DVD as most movies are. For most recent DVD players, the DVD-R format will not pose a problem, but some (mainly older) DVD players may not be able to play this disc.

The disc is done very professionally in full screen (4:3) format. It appears to be a purely video recording (not film converted to video) and the detail is excellent. Sound quality ialso very good.

While there is considerable overlap between this DVD and ""Moving America's Lighthouse"" (ASIN B0000X02PK) in the coverage of the story about the 1999 move of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, the two do complement one another. Included exclusively in this DVD are scenes of the computerized monitoring station which watched for any tilt in the tower as well as scenes shot beneath the tower while it was moving. While the other DVD provides a somewhat broader overview (see its review) of what led up to the move, this one focuses somewhat more on the move itself (although some background and related info is also provided). As a result this DVD may appeal slightly more to the technically-minded viewer. But any lighthouse devotee would find it of interest.",1096502400,13,1240,4.789719626168225
