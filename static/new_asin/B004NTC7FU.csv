8436818,5,B004NTC7FU,"I purchased this movie for a bit of narcissistic pleasure... I'm actually briefly in one of the scenes. They filmed part of this movie in a restaurant I was working in in Georgetown and asked if any of the staff wanted to sit in. As it was a brief moment on the camera, SAG cards weren't required. The three primary leads were all wonderful people to meet, very polite and courteous. The film, as far as I am aware from people I've spoken to, is not too much of a sensationalism on what really goes on behind the scenes in DC.",1357171200,,526,4.217821782178218
8436819,5,B004NTC7FU,"The writing and acting are excellent.  The film's sharp focus and whit mock the hypocritical nature of politician's morality, lobbyists' mercenary values, and even the precociously pragmatic attitude of interns on Capital Hill.  For those who don't follow politics it will seem as though the creative license for both the main character's fall from grace and the lengths to which he will to get back in the game are taken to an extreme for humor and to good effect.  Not to mention the politicians and their staffers priorities.  For those who do follow Washington's players and their minions, you will see that almost every line of the script and all the characters are based exactly or closely on real events over the last two decades.  Thus it is a great film for those in the know about Washington, and for those who'd like to know about it without seeing a documentary (or reading  about it...).",1307232000,,900,4.774193548387097
8436820,5,B004NTC7FU,"I couldn't stop laughing during this movie.  Tate Donovan is brilliantly cast as a down-and-out lobbyist in D.C. who's trying to make a come-back.  He is great at comedy.  Kind of reminds me of Bill Murray with his hilarious facial expressions.  The writing is terrific - everything ties together, and the D.C. jokes are great.  Nice shots of D.C., too.  All in all, a very enjoyable movie!",1307232000,2,390,4.746268656716418
