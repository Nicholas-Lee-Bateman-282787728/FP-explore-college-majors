7721655,5,B01DPW1A0I,"The cast and Pure Flix have done it again!  Entertaining, stirring, true story about a woman of faith whose classroom became a battleground because she answered a question about the similarity of the goals of Jesus Christ and his follower Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.  The court scene that followed both was intense and engrossing.  The viciousness and hatred of opposition, both in the crowd and the courtroom, roasted the teacher and her faith.

A teacher in this present era may teach, indoctrinate, and even preach the virtues and values of any religion except the one that brought the United States into being. . ..  Remember, most of our forefathers came to this hemisphere looking for religious freedom:  to speak, teach and preach to their families and communities what they believed was good and right about God.  So, why is this basic truth a forbidden subject?

I like the grit and unpredictability of the young lawyer, and the grumpy pastor. . . and the sincerity of the Chinese university student.",1459641600,24,1010,4.9
7721656,5,B01DPW1A0I,"I am so pleased with the quality of God's Not Dead 2!  Not just the production quality, though the acting is great--but especially the script, which makes me think of it like a present-day Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.  If you think about Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and God's Not Dead 2, there are a lot of similarities in style and tone and also how an inexperienced defendant and inexperienced lawyer/legal adviser have to win over the sympathies of hardened opponents, only succeeding at the very end after things kept getting worse.  The dialogue has an excellent rhythm to it in this movie, and the types of arguments raised in the ""separation of church and state"" controversy are explained with language that sounds intelligent but is easily understandable if you're not very familiar with these issues.

Fred Thompson (lawyer, senator, and actor, who played a major role in the Watergate investigation and ran as a conservative candidate for Pres. in 2008) plays a senior pastor in one scene, in his last role before his recent death from cancer.  Ernie Hudson (whose most famous role has been Winston Zeddemore, the black Ghostbuster) plays an intimidating but somewhat reasonable judge in the protracted court battle.  Pat Boone gets to sing a little bit and has a very insightful line about God seeming distant in our hardest times because the teacher has to be silent during the student's really hard test.  That's a similar analogy to the Footprints in the Sand parable (whose authorship is uncertain) where the normal times have 2 pairs of footprints but the hardest times have just one, because it's then that God carried us.

The movie does a good job reminding audiences about characters and jokes from the first movie.  This is overall a better movie than the first one in its filmmaking quality and seems more believable to me.  The first one seemed a bit hokey to me in its portrayal of a professor going to war against a student about whether God exists and wasn't altogether stellar in the classroom arguments in favor of God's existence.  (I have no major complaints about the first one except how loud the concert is at the end of the movie, though.)  I'm surprised this one (the sequel) legally got away with using the acronym ""ACLU"" to identify the lawyer who is out to destroy the innocent teacher who was answering a question in class by quoting a Bible passage.  I have the benefit of a lot of immersion in public schools and don't think the setup on this is entirely plausible, but it's definitely the KIND of thing that happens all the time.  The chances of getting punished as a teacher for preaching religion are not nearly as great if the teacher simply answers a question within the context of the subject matter, compared to if a teacher or students promote(s) prayer or a certain religious club on campus, but I suppose it's not inconceivable.  I just don't think the specific scenario this movie gives is very likely.  The atheist professor played by Kevin Sorbo in the first one, Professor Radisson, is pretty much a jerk, and the ACLU lawyer in the sequel is too, and I'm sure that is going to be a turn-off to non-Christian audiences.  But these movies are not intended to please secularists, and secularists probably wouldn't even appreciate it if these movies added more complexity to the atheist opponents.

I like that this movie also gives you a clear path to do your own reading by briefly featuring several Christian apologists and telling what their specialties are.  It's okay to not find every apologist's argument convincing; I myself don't buy every argument in favor of the reliability of the Gospels, though the end result is the same for me as for them.  There's a good balance of emotion and reason in this movie, along with the personal relationship elements which all good movies need.

If you see the movie, stay through the end of the credits to see an extra scene.  A teaser for #3?",1459555200,30,3945,4.75366568914956

7721689,2,B01DPW1A0I,"I am a follower of Jesus.  I have also taught public school for 30 years.  My objection to this movie is the notion that public education is an atheist affair.  I cannot tell you how many Christians I know in public education.  We pray for our students.  We pray together.  We are NOT attacked because of our beliefs.  We are NOT persecuted.  Just as the LEFT misrepresents things in the media and on film, so does the RIGHT.  You are NOT representing reality and this is what turns off so many in the middle.  Both the LEFT and the RIGHT think they have so many followers.  Truth be told, most people are in the middle.  Jesus is not a hard sell.  Stop swinging so far RIGHT.  We are ALL brothers and sisters in Christ.  We need to find common ground and LOVE each other.  If you want to see the way things should be done, I suggest you check out the movie ""I Can Only Imagine.""  I am tired of the RIGHT vilifying public education.  Both the left and the right have done much damage both to public education, but also to educators and students.  But, the RIGHT has done the most damage.  I am independent.  I have voted for Republicans and Democrats.  Stop radicalizing our nation.  Be the radical middle.  Love your neighbor.",1526688000,,1227,4.375

It brought out, in dramatic fashion, issues that are being actively debated in our culture today. The first movie was strong on apologetics, on evidences and a case in favor of the Christian faith. This sequel brought out good evidence for the historicity of Jesus Himself. The movie also dramatized pressure and opposition to the Christian faith in society today, dramatizing the cost of following Jesus in the face of opposition. I have seen comments indicating that this depiction is unrealistic. Those comments try to claim that the way in which this battle is presented is not real or not credible. It is both real and credible. The movie held my interest throughout and made me very eager to see the third movie now playing in theaters.",1525046400,2,846,4.801369863013699

7721711,4,B01DPW1A0I,"I came to this film thinking that it was going to be a carbon copy of the original, and not a true sequel.  Partly right on the first issue, but definitely wrong on the second.

""God's Not Dead 2"" is a true sequel and purveyors of the first film who appreciated several of the side characters like the reporter who got cancer and the Chinese student who defied his dad are going to find themselves quickly connected to this sequel as there are several returning players most especially the two pastors.  Specifically in the cases of the reporter and the student their storylines are continued with varying degrees of effectiveness.

The real blood and meat of this film isn't in its being a sequel but ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" actress' Melissa Joan Hart's character Grace Wesley, a High School history teacher who answers a student's question about Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.'s drawing inspiration from Jesus' words and teachings, and soon finds herself embroiled in a legal battle that seeks to separate church and state and demonize her faith and personhood.  The force of law is threatened against her and so this too like the first film is a David versus Goliath story (only with a lot less Newsboys and Duck Dynasty advertisements, although there are those).  This film isn't quite as successful on that account as the first film was and I'm not sure why.  Was it because it was an adult who had a position of authority already in her classroom that was up against it instead of a college newbie kid?  Or was it because the film tried to steal some movie magic from the likes of ""Miracle On 34th Street's"" courtroom standoff?

The courtroom standoff is designed to relay the gospel message but it's diminshed here as the sequel's apologetic focus is more laid out on the historicity of Jesus versus the goodness of God/ Jesus and the salvation that He offers a lost world.  It's also more heavily focused on the rights of the Christian to be able to hold their beliefs and while this is an extremely important message as it covers not just the Christian's but everyone else's rights too in an increasingly politically charged and emotionally and spiritually segregated culture it also misses a mark: that Christians don't need this ""right to believe"" and should expect to suffer persecution.  The film is a warning against this, almost as if Christians should be informed that they don't have to suffer persecution, and I don't know if the filmmaker's intended that message to slip out (I think they meant to inform other American Christian's that if they do suffer political persecution they have a recourse, and perhaps also as a warning that this recourse may not last).  Though the media doesn't cover this with any significant frequency Christian's across the globe are under intense persecution and are often literally killed for their faith and confessions.  ""God's Not Dead 2"" completely ignores this and thus it shows a glaring flaw: that it is a distinctly American film.

I'm not going to downgrade the film because of that flaw.  I think that it sets out to accomplish what it's trying to accomplish in an entertaining way.  I'm not a fan of Hart but I found that her performance, which was subdued and a little unsure, to be convincing and even grounded.  She is a person who portrayed a meek personality with a strong but undemanding backbone.  She portrayed what many American Christians are probably truly like.  The side stories aren't blended together as neatly as in the first but one of the things that I liked the most is how the Chinese student perseveres and is carried through in this film.  And, lastly, while the courtroom drama had more laughs than fireworks it was still an engaging piece to the story.  Overall ""God's Not Dead 2"" isn't as powerful or enjoyable as the original but it still succeeds.",1523664000,,3842,4.7734138972809665

Oh, you can mention god or goddess (mother earth or mother nature, even gaia) without fear because there are many gods and goddesses allowed in public schools (even allah is allowed), and m.e. even has her own unholy day, earth day!

7721756,1,B01DPW1A0I,"(Spoiler alert) Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. and their commitment to non-violence are being discussed in a high school AP history class. A student Brooke asks if this is similar to the teachings of Jesus. The teacher Grace Wesley responds that it is and make some references to the bible.

The movies plot collapses right at the beginning. The bible references are enough to get her dragged to the principals office where she is forced to either recant her statements or face the end of her teaching career  a highly, unlikely scenario to begin with. Grace was only answering a students question. She wasn't leading her students in prayer and she wasn't preaching from the bible as though she were teaching Sunday school. The mere references to the bible, however, are too much for Brookes freethinking parents and the evil ACLU. Brookes parents file a lawsuit against Grace.

As the courtroom drama starts to unfold, we learn that ACLU lawyer Peter Kanes goal is to prove, once and for all, that God is dead. In the jury selection process, Duck Dynasty fans are considered reliable to the defense, while Pretty Little Liars fans are considered helpful for the ACLU. Brookes parents are never shown mourning the recent death of their son in a traffic accident, and are hoping that the winnings from the lawsuit will finance Brookes going to college at Stanford. The movie overlooks the probability that a high school teacher is most likely not a person with deep pockets. As if making a mountain out of Graces molehill response to Brookes question wasn't bad enough, the movie goes off on tangents about the separation of religion from government and the historical existence of Jesus.

I'm assuming the makers of the movie didn't hire a legal consultant to provide them with advice on the fine points of trial procedure. In the real world, an attorney cannot compel his own client to take the stand, and would definitely not treat her as a hostile witness. The ACLU attorney should have been raising objections to the defense bringing in Christian apologists to prove the existence of Jesus (or at least he should have brought in his own expert witness who could have shown there is no evidence to support the historical existence of Jesus). The whole court room scene would make any 1st-year law student laugh.

There are a few subplots going on in the movie. The atheist-turned-Christian blogger Amy Ryan who found in Gods Not Dead 1 (GND 1) that she had advanced cancer learns that the cancer is in complete remission and believes that it was cured by prayer. The Chinese student Martin Yip, who became a Christian in GND 1, is disowned by his father who has arrived to take him home. Brooke discovers that her late brother was a Christian. Eventually, she becomes a Christian (what a shock). Like GND 1, the movie ends at the Newsboys Christian rock concert.

And just to add a little fuel to the conspiracy fire, a group of ministers are told by their senior pastor (Fred Dalton Thompson is his final film role) that their sermons for the past three months are being subpoenaed -- never mind the fact the such a subpoena, which screams First Amendment violations, is never likely to be issued in the first place. He never says who issued the subpoena. At the end of the movie after the credits, Pastor David Hill (another character from GND 1) is arrested for refusing to comply with the subpoena. In the real world, the ACLU would have helped the ministers defeat the subpoena.

As in GND 1, non-Christians are held in low regard. They are portrayed as either shallow (Brooke's parents), rigid (Yip's father), or devious (ACLU lawyer Peter Kane).

The cases listed, by the way, in the closing credits which claim that Christians are being persecuted for their beliefs have almost nothing to do with religion in public schools. Their focus is instead on requirements for birth control coverage under health insurance laws, and laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The message of the movie is that Christians are victims and are under attack from all sides by evil secular rationalist forces that control the government  even in Arkansas (the state's never mentioned by name but its flag and the state capitol building are shown on a few occasions). The movie is made by Christians for Christians who aren't going to ask hard questions about how it's so out of touch with reality.

In the real world, some Christians (but not all) want to tear down the separation of religion from government so that they can use the government to spread their religion. Roy Moore, Pat Robertson, et, al, rail for mandatory prayer and mandatory bible studies in public schools. The non-Christians (Moslems, Jews, atheists, among others) that stand up against these high-and-mighty leaders are the ones who have been targets of hate and violence. They sometimes have had to classify themselves in lawsuits as John or Jane Does. They're not likely to have large crowds supporting them outside the court, like the crowds cheering the ACLU in this movie. Usually, they'll face angry crowds.

In recent years, some Christians (but not all) have been portraying themselves as victims for not being able to discriminate against LGBT individuals.

Note: As a historian, I would have responded to Brookes questions by pointing out MLKs references to Jesus in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, which Graces lawyer referenced in the court. I would have also mentioned that Gandhi said, I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. (Christian Europeans, especially the British, in Gandhis day treated non-Christians and non-whites like second-class people or worse, which hardly reflected a belief in love thy neighbor.)",1519084800,6,5780,4.909836065573771

7721773,1,B01DPW1A0I,"The movie presents a courtroom drama about a public high school history teacher defending her right to mention Jesus purely as a historical figure.  The movie badly misrepresents how American trials normally proceed, but it seems pretty accurate in portraying evangelical Christians as ignorant, dishonest, hate-mongering hypocrites.

Lets start with the movies obvious hate-mongering, a staple of Christian apologetics.  The movies premise is that legal restrictions unfairly prohibit public high school teachers from mentioning Jesus as a historical figure, even in history class.  That premise is sure to rile up evangelical snowflakes who are already convinced that our godless gubmint is out to destroy Christianity, however, the movie provides no evidence whatsoever that any such laws actually exist, so the movies premise looks like an obviously illegitimate attempt to promote hate.

Furthermore, our godless gubmint is hardly godless at all.  Almost all of the 535 or so members of Congress are Christians, the Supreme Court is dominated by Christians, and both the President and Vice-President are fond of braying about their Christian faith.  But of course, mere facts aren't likely to soothe the paranoid fears of evangelical snowflakes.

Furthermore, not only does the movie imply that the ACLUs attempts to challenge religious coercion by government authorities  usually Christian  are unpatriotic, it also suggests that the ACLU tries to financially ruin individual Christians by filing lawsuits against them.  Both suggestions are sure to rile up evangelical snowflakes even more, but the movie provides no credible justification whatsoever for believing that the ACLUs attempts to limit religious coercion are unpatriotic, nor does it provide any evidence whatsoever that the ACLU routinely demands such monetary damages in any similar cases that it initiated against private individuals.  The movies undocumented insinuations here are apparently just further, despicable attempts at hate-mongering.

Hate-mongering is pretty standard for a lot of Christian apologists, but it seems especially ironic for this movie, since the classroom discussion that prompted the lawsuit in the first place included a description of Jesus teaching his followers to love their enemies.  So not only is the movie dishonest, its also hypocritical, which also seems to be par for the course for a lot of evangelicals, who apparently aren't aware of Christs repeated denunciations of hypocrisy.

The movies director also seems to be as ignorant about normal trial procedure as he is about Christian morality.  For example:

During jury selection, both the teachers lawyer and the judge made obvious errors regarding the difference between peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.

Both sides opening statements were actually far more like closing arguments.

One defense witness, a former homicide detective, testified that Luke and Matthew provided independent eyewitness corroboration for each other's account of a particular incident that allegedly occurred shortly before the crucifixion, and the movie presented that testimony as if it were an unchallengeable truth, even though there little or no credible evidence showing that either Matthew or Luke were actual eyewitnesses to that particular incident, and even though there is substantial research indicating that both Matthew and Luke relied on many of the same sources.  That badly undermines, if not completely destroys, the witnesss glib assumptions that Matthew and Luke were both independent and eyewitnesses, so the movies implication that the witnesss conclusions were unchallengeable truths is simply preposterous.

The judge erroneously told the defendant teacher that she was legally required to testify, and then he allowed her own lawyer to treat her as a hostile witness.

Later, the judge asked if the teacher wanted to change her plea, indicating that the judge didn't understand the difference between civil and criminal trials.

The judges instructions to the jury were a complete joke, but neither the plaintiff nor the defendant objected to them.

In short, the whole trial was pretty much just stupid, with glaring errors from start to finish.

To top it all off, the poor, beleaguered history teacher, her voice choked with emotion, finally testified that her only motivation was to tell [my students] the truth, which she then went on to explain included her personal belief that Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior.  Boooom!!!  The seemingly innocent premise of the movie  that public school teachers may legitimately cite Jesus as a purely historical figure  is exposed as a complete hoax.  What the movie actually wants is for Christian teachers in public schools to be allowed to use their positions of authority to cram their religious beliefs down the throats of young children, regardless of what the childrens parents want and regardless of what the Constitution allows.  Of course, the movies director would undoubtedly be outraged if public high school Muslim teachers ever started advocating Islam in their classrooms, but brazen hypocrisy on something like that seems to be pretty much par for the course among evangelical Christians.

Finally, the closing shot of the jury focuses on the crucifix tattoo of one of the jurors.  The director might as well have put up a billboard proclaiming that Christians should simply ignore the law and the facts and decide cases based on their religious beliefs instead.  Apparently the  director thinks that unrestrained Christian bigotry is the hallmark of true patriotism.

As this movie indicates, evangelicals are frequently ignorant, dishonest, hate-mongering hypocrites.  Before trying to usurp government authority to cram their religious beliefs down others throats, perhaps they ought to start practicing what Jesus actually taught about NOT being ignorant, dishonest, hate-mongering hypocrites.

Amen.",1516838400,3,5946,5.565555555555555
7721774,5,B01DPW1A0I,"When a teacher answers a question in a historical context she has no idea she will be in big trouble and may get fired from her job. Simply by quoting a verse where Jesus talks about loving our enemies she somehow apparently breaks a rule and is disciplined and suspended from teaching.

Most of the movie is spent in the courtroom with two lawyers fighting it out. That to me made the movie intellectually invigorating. I love seeing two smart guys go to battle with each other over secular and Christian ideas.

I felt this movie was very emotional and the stories that intertwined were beautiful. I can recommend this movie to Christians and Atheists and to anyone interested in the battle between humanism and Christianity. I hope they are planning a third movie because the end of this movie leaves you wondering what will happen to the pastor.

So this movie is even better than the first one. I look forward to a third if they produce another movie.

7721853,5,B01DPW1A0I,We had a movie night with friends and everyone cheered at the ending.  I think this was based on an actual event but is not the actual event itself.  The testimonies and statements said in the courtroom are worth stopping the movie and writing down.  Excellent cases for the validity of Christ.  I think it will appeal to all ages.  My grandson has autism and cerebral palsy and he loves this movie. His handicap is mild so he surprises us with how much he memorized of the statements made in the courtroom.  This is also a good family night video to watch.,1500336000,2,557,4.411764705882353

7721866,5,B01DPW1A0I,"I LOVED this!! I read some of the critical reviews from Christians first, so I went into watching this movie slightly more skeptical than I typically would be. I have to say that most of us as Christians have been on the receiving end of many of the statements made in this movie, so that portion of it in particular was taken from real life for sure. There may have been some creative liberty taken in the courtroom scenes, and its somewhat important to remember that Christ did say Christians will suffer persecution, so we won't always ""win"". I did feel that this fact was represented in one of the side stories in this movie, which again happens often enough in real life. I'm so glad that I watched this faith-building movie.

7721874,5,B01DPW1A0I,"I enjoyed the first God's Not Dead... but this movie was even better.

I thought over all God's Not Dead 2 was better written and told a better story.  My 14 year old daughter also loved the movie.

I though the movie was a good representation of what could happened to some people who's rights are being trampled on.  However my wife who woks in public school thought that some of the story was very unrealistic and that a school board would never act the way they do in the movie.  Of course at the end of the movie is a long list of court cases that are each a real-life example of religious liberties under assault.  I believe my wife's thoughts are due to use being in a more tolerant area of the county where everyone beliefs including Christians is respected.

Anyway the movie is not perfect but it sure presents a view of life in America that is never reported or miss reported by main stream media.",1497052800,,908,4.337278106508876

7722048,1,B01DPW1A0I,"Im not an atheist but this made me want to be one. It does nothing but promoted Christian the victim culture and spread the the belief that Christians are consistently being persecuted by Society. News flash 70% of the population of the United States identify themselves as Christian I'm pretty sure that you all are the majority and not being persecuted. Through the entire movie christians consistently persecuted for their beliefs under fake laws that don't exist in real life. The writers even went as far as to make an Asian kid seem like he was being persecuted by is Godless communist father lol wow.  By the end I found this movie to be just like first in a sense that it is nothing but a bunch of argumentative Twitter and Facebook posts formulated into a movie script and stretched over two hours. I fail to see how this movie could help anyone grow in their faith.

 On a lighter note I will say Melissa Joan Hart did a great job acting in this flim",1484870400,6,960,4.474285714285714

I am a born again Christian and I appreciated how the movie accurately showed the acts of persecution against Christians at work, in public education, and in other areas that are wrongly being done. It also showed how Christians can successfully assert their God given rights and U.S. Constitutional rights.  In addition, the movie provided reliable and factual evidence to support the truth of Christianity and the Bible. The acting was very professional and the movie was excellent.

In real life, Christians sell products and if its not generic or made for atheist's/LGBT community they are bashed over the head and sued especially if you say you want to open a Christian bakery or bring a bible to school (atheist's a lot more then LGBT complain about bringing bibles to school). We should be able to bring bibles to school because of the educational purpose. To debate something and not be bias about it you must have both sides which means as an atheist have your manifest or creed and bible quotes to refute people. I love being a Christian. I think that atheist's need to remember this movie is hyped up a little bit for people to buy it. I see the difference between amazon reviews and imdb.com reviews which has a lot of atheist reviews on it.

7722237,3,B01DPW1A0I,"Let me first start out by saying the most obvious fact about this movie. The teacher didn't do anything wrong by answering the student's question or by quoting what is believed to be the words of Jesus. The student brought it up as it was relevant to the lesson about Ghandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. Whether or not Jesus or God exist is completely irrelevant to the point.

Now I'm an atheist and watched this movie without for a second thinking that anyone proved the existence of a god or of Jesus. I think there will always be a reason to doubt that the God that Christians believe in exists. I do not think that a belief in deities would necessarily lead someone to be a Christian. They could just as easily end up a Muslim, Jew, Hindu, or something else.

But because it was a movie made by Christians and for a Christian audience. It's naturally going to frame these issues as being Christian's vs. Atheists. That is one problem that this movie and the first movie both have in common that is disappointing.

However, at the same time I did like this movie because it represented what might happen if such a court case happened, in fact something similar may have already happened that I'm not aware of.

What I do know is that I don't want anyone to be falsely accused of something and lose their job over it. I've heard of atheists losing their job because Christians didn't like their lack of belief. It's just as wrong in the reverse direction. People can discuss these issues if they dare but it's just plain mean to sue each other over it.

One final thing. In this movie the Christians talk about God being in control. Of course this is expected given that Christians teach that God is omnipotent and omniscient. But think for a minute about the implications. Everything that happens in the movie, as well as real life is part of some grand plan by God to teach people something. This is something that I've heard Christians say all my life and this movie tries to reinforce that message. What this means is that God is basically a puppet master that is behind everything, including all the murder, rape, and lies in the world. At the same time, they also say God is good all the time. Which is it? Is God good at the same time as allowing/causing pain to billions of people? I think not.",1479945600,,2304,4.450236966824645

This film does an excellent job of presenting all that is at issue when a teacher is taken to task by authorities under the banner of ""separation of church and state"".  This idea of ""separation of church and state"" is a considerable distortion that is used by atheists to cow Christians into silence.  The perception is created that a Christian who is simply being a Christian has done something wrong, just because organizations such as the ACLU have intimidated education institutions and other institutions to believe that Christians ought not to express their religion freely on business time.  I have found it gratifying to find that the law really is on the side of freedom of religious expression, notwithstanding that atheist insist otherwise.

7722289,4,B01DPW1A0I,"Great Christian movie that everyone should enjoy. It tells a story but unfortunately, I have seen other films that came out first tell the same story. To me it rips off that other film and when I see that, I have to wonder if they wanted to make an important Christian film with a message or did they just want to capitalize on the success of the first God is not dead film. That's for you to decide. Either way I have to say I enjoyed it very much and look forward to the next in the series which talks about Pastors being forced to submit to the authorities their sermons and one who stood up to them! Not as good as the first film which unfortunately happens all to often. If your going to make a part 2, then you should make it even better than the first. They didn't as most don't. A shame they had the opportunity to make it even better and blew it but still not a bad movie.",1478131200,,881,4.068965517241379

Some of the acting and lines were a little cheesy in some places, but overall this movie is really on target from a truth perspective in out current society.  If fact, this movie was pretty much based on recent and current factual cases here in America.  It is scarey how Christianity is being viciously attacked by those on the left leaning fringe and by the liberal judicial system here in America.  People of faith in this country have been fined for not baking cakes for or agreeing to photograph same-sex weddings.  Some have even been jailed in this country for standing up for their sincerely held Christian beliefs.  This movie is a wake up call to anyone who would like America to remain a free country.",1475625600,,750,4.559701492537314

Melissa Joan Hart is joined by a notable and stellar cast to deliver a great piece of cinema that shows why it is important to stand up for a genuine faith in Jesus Christ. Many people gave this sequel a bad review, but I was personally drawn into the plot of the film. It struggled a little with continuity, but as far as overall message is concerned, it succeeded. I've gained an appreciation for PureFlix Entertainment and their initiative to deliver quality films with a genuine message related to the Bible. God's Not Dead 2 is a very nice addition to that effort because it delivers a storyline that can play out in our current contemporary society. God's Not Dead 2 is highly recommended. It is my hope with the open plot left in the film, there will be a God's Not Dead 3.",1475193600,3,803,4.395973154362416

Our society and our government is changing at a rapid pace and the day is now here when we must truly be suited up in our Ephesians 6 spiritual armor to face the enemy's strategic attacks against our devotion to our precious Jesus. I believe an excellent scripture reference to parallel with this film can be found in Matthew 10: 17-20 ""But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge  you in their synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.""",1474502400,,873,4.227544910179641

7722500,1,B01DPW1A0I,"Full disclosure here: I'm not Christian. However, there have been some Christian faith-based movies that I've really liked, even when the acting wasn't totally A- list. I liked Courageous, & even Fireproof, quite a lot. Full disclosure, part 2: I LOVE Melissa Joan Hart, who was the entire reason we rented this movie. She's very good at balancing humor and seriousness and being incredibly relatable, so I was excited to see how she did in this film.

This was the first and only time I've ever NOT been a fan of her performance, & I have to say, I don't think it was her- or any of the other bad acting moments some of the other actors (who have been AWESOME in other things!) had- so much as the writing... the writing was awful.

There is a way to weave faith into a story that leaves you riveted until the end, questioning yourself, & searching for what you do believe in an incredibly valuable way. If it's done poorly, though, it ends up just feeling completely absurd, totally unbelievable, & like the longest after school special you've ever sat through, which is EXACTLY how this movie felt.

The storyline was very rushed and over the top. Not to spoil anything, but the main character didn't even do anything WRONG here. She didn't bring up Jesus, the student did, & she responded with a relevant scripture, which could have worked anyway, considering they were talking about Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who wove scripture into his speeches. She didn't give the student a bible, a woman found it amongst the student's brother's possessions after his death & gave it back. Basically, Grace ended up fighting a fake battle, because she didn't even do the things of which she was accused, but instead of explaining that, a mountain turned into a molehill, with lots of hokey catchphrases using ""Jesus"" as a buzzword. I think audiences, Christian or otherwise, deserved better than they got with this movie.",1474243200,6,1920,4.7253731343283585

7722509,5,B01DPW1A0I,"Awesome movie!  An eye opener!

Sadly, we are being persecuted for our Christian faith. Thankfully, in America it's not to death like in other parts of the world.

But, many Americans are being persecuted/silenced, with the ""threatening"" of their lost of jobs or even jail time.

Before the ""credits"" it even shows all the ""real life"" cases of Americans being persecuted and who are being denied their Freedom of Speech/Religion.

Example:
We would not ask an African American Clothing Company to design hoodies for the bigoted KKK.

So, this movie is making us aware that  Christian Americans just want the FREEDOM to honor their God! 
And we should be able to teach/share/speak equal to other Americans who teach our children what ""they believe"", which dishonors our LORD.

Hopefully, this movie can help us ""LOVE"" our neighbors, bless our enemies and boldly STANDING against what is evil... offering God's forgiveness and mercy!",1474156800,,931,5.112582781456954

7722560,1,B01DPW1A0I,"I try to keep an open mind. I try to listen to each side of an argument so that I can come out with a clearer head and perhaps stronger rhetoric for the area of the spectrum I fall onto. This movie however, it doesn't offer much except a prolonged straw man argument for the religious right to eat up. The 'atheist' characters are caricatures whose rhetoric is as limited as the writers imagination. Dic Dastardly is a better written villain than the supposed atheists in this movie. It tries too hard to be a courtroom drama but fails on the most fundamental level: in order to accurately portray drama in the courtroom the opposing side has to be allowed to make an intelligent and well refuted case that makes the watcher think.

The thing that most annoys me is that they could have made it more interesting and more compelling if they'd just bothered to do a little research on the legal arguments opposed to their viewpoint instead of trying to cram hamfisted attempts at the rhetoric.

For example:
During the jury selection phase one of the main characters (who oddly enough is a pastor) has been summoned for Jury duty for the trial. When through a meandering of coincidence the plaintiffs have run out of challenges, they ask the judge for a special dismissal based upon the man's profession. The defendant's lawyer, of course, objects stating that such would be discrimination based upon religion. And instead of presenting the fact that the man's faith is not the question but how objective he can be expected to be while ruling on a subject matter he has dedicated his adult life to propagating is not even brought up. His faith isn't the criteria for exclusion but the fact that he works in the field of study and thus would have preconceived biases makes him unsuitable to be an adequate juror.

Another example;
During open arguments the Defendant's Lawyer rides out the old line that the phrase ""Separation of Church and State"" does not appear in the actual text of the Constitution, and the plaintiff's lawyer allows it to go unchallenged and instead goes to calling witnesses. A competent Lawyer would have immediately called a lawyer to the stand with even the tiniest smidgen of Constitutional study under his belt to testify that while the words are not written out, however they are clearly implied in the 1st Amendment and within Article VI of the US Constitution or within the Treaty of Tripoli which was ratified unanimously by the Senate in 1797.",1473206400,27,2473,4.7331786542923435

7722562,5,B01DPW1A0I,"The sequel, new main characters alongside some of the original cast playing only minor roles.  This dramatization is focused on religious freedom in the USA and how that impacts people of Christian faith going about their work-lives while being true to their unpopular faith convictions - in this case a high school history teacher.  It is a thought provoking depiction aimed at exploring the boundaries of what constitutes facts about religious history verses religious persuasion.

7722616,5,B01DPW1A0I,"""God is not Dead 2"" is the finest Christian movie ever made, in my opinion. I rate it even above ""War Room"", though if I hadn't seen the
War Room"" message first and put it into practice I might not appreciate this movie as much as I do. ""War Room"" explains how spiritual warfare works, and ""God is not Dead 2"" shows what it looks like when it happens. Both side of the controversial issue of talking about Jesus in the classroom are presented well -- no favor is given to either side, so the plot is as solid as life.

This is why I try not to set my expectations too high on followup movies. I was pleasantly surprised to find this was just as awesome as the first movie. It had the same actors and actresses as the first movie which made me very happy because it is always a bummer when they switch them out with new actors in sequels which really messes up the whole thing and makes it harder to follow.

There is a fantastic story line going on in this movie that is very relevant to today's ""politically correct"" push by our government.

7722652,3,B01DPW1A0I,"This week the movie Gods Not Dead 2 is being released on DVD.  I had the privilege to watch the movie on the net this week with my husband.

As the title suggest it, this is the second movie with the words Gods Not Dead.  Though this is a second installment on the issue of the name of Jesus not being welcome in public places, this movie is different that the previous one because this time around the problem start within the wall of a classroom of an history class in high school.

A teacher who is loved by most of her students answer truthfully a question of one of her student.  In her answer she quote some words from Jesus and by doing so gets into trouble first with the school and school board and then in court due to her refusal to sign a paper saying she has been out of line.

I will not go into the details of the whole movie  which last about two hours  because then it would not make it interesting for you to check it out.  However, let me tell you that there is also a couple of intertwined stories throughout the movie.  And yes you will see the appearance of the Newsboys in the movie along with a few other prominent writers...  The part we enjoyed the most was when these writers explained why the Gospels are reliable.

If you have seen the first movie, you will recognize some of the actors but the main characters are new actors for the most part.

The movie was okay I suppose.  But I did not enjoy it as much as Miracles from Heaven which I wrote about not too long ago.  There were times where I found the movie was a bit slow in transiting between the scenes.  Personally I would have preferred to have a bit more action in the movie.  However, the quality of it is above what you would expect for a Christian movie.  Keep in mind that this movie is fictional  what I mean by that is that indeed there as been cases of teacher being sued for talking about Jesus in the past but the other issue for pastors mentioned in the movie is not happening at this point in time.  Maybe one day it will come to it but I do not believe it will be in a near future.

Finally, the movie contains numerous with positive elements from people sharing how their faith helps them through life, prayer examples, how we can encouragement one another as well as how to stand up for our faith in the midst of adversity.

So it was refreshing to watch a movie which looked right in the eyes of our cultural chaos.  There are some places in the movie that may have been acted better, and there were all sort of problems with the way the jury was sent to deliberate, but the problem was dealt with well.

I would even recommend it to people who say ""God is dead.""  This recommendation flows out of the fact the insider - outsider conflict is about to explode.  We need to see what is happening.  This movie really presents it well.",1471392000,14,739,4.280575539568345

7722666,5,B01DPW1A0I,"Gods Not Dead 2 starts off by introducing several characters and leaves you wondering how they will all be tied together in the story. Some of the characters are returning from the first Gods Not Dead, but there are several new ones as well.

The story is about a teacher who answers a question her student asks in History class. The problem? The question was about Jesus. Another student tells someone else, and immediately the teacher is suspended and theres a huge law suit about her supposedly preaching in class.

The movie isn't very fast paced or action-packed, but it is intriguing. I loved the multiple famous Christian guest appearances throughout the movie, and I learned some more evidence to historically support the writings of the Bible. There are some funny moments through the movie, and I didn't find it boring at all.

There is, of course, no questionable content. No sex, no swearing, no drugs. The only instance of violence is one person being slapped by another one time. I would say that this video is appropriate for the family to watch.

I really enjoyed this movie and I encourage you to watch it; I think you will too! It portrays the sad state of affairs in our society that freedom of speech seems to need to fit into the parameters that the government sets, and that society in general is tolerant to everyone and all beliefsunless you're Christian.

7722671,1,B01DPW1A0I,"God's Not Dead 2 is another paranoid fantasy where Christians are being persecuted for their beliefs in the US. A teacher, Grace Wesley, is asked a question about Jesus in history class and gives an innocent answer. Suddenly, an arsenal of evil atheists led by the ACLU takes her to court for violating the separation of church and state. Meanwhile, pastors are forced to hand in their sermons for review by a government agency in a subplot that is introduced and then dropped and never resolved.

The whole plot is ludicrous. In the real world, the villains obviously wouldn't have a case because Wesley didn't actually preach to her students. But for the sake of the plot she's taken to court so that we can get to hear ""expert witnesses"" like Lee Strobel tell us that Jesus really existed, as if that's what the case was really about. In the closing credits, about a dozen real court cases are cited as inspiration, but if you read the summaries about them not even one of them is even remotely similar to the case in the movie. This just shows that the whole premise of the movie is a complete straw man with no basis in reality, designed to feed the persecution complex of some Christians. Movies like this only makes Christians look ridiculous.",1470528000,14,1250,4.63063063063063

7722677,4,B01DPW1A0I,"Very good movie. It does a good job presenting the case for belief in G*d (apparently amazon won't let me spell the full word out), specifically the Christian G*d accurately. It shows why atheism has to contradict itself in order to offer answers to some questions. Considering it's a 2 hr movie though, I think it does a great job. Below is my response to Pablo Alamos review since either he or Amazon are deleting it and I don't think it's right for people to get the idea that it's wrong to have doubts or try to understand G*d. He isn't afraid of our doubts or questions and He gives us answers to them through both the Scriptures and His creation. BOTH are His and we can see his fingerprints on everything in creation.
""Youre confusing knowledge ABOUT G*d with having the same infinite knowledge OF G*d. You claim that anyone professing a knowledge of the Almighty is a liar and a false prophet while at the same time contradicting yourself by claiming knowledge of the Almighty (Jesus Christ was clear that this was the last revelation of G.) Apologetics (the Christian branch of theology that argues for and defends the existence of G*d) is carrying out the commands Paul gave us in 2 Corinthians 10:5 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of G*d, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. and that Peter gave us in 1 Peter 3:15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you. This movie is showing that the belief in G*d is rational and reasonable by using our G*d given gifts of logic, reasoning, and scientific evidence to give a defense for the faith that is in us. Part of loving G*d with all your mind as commanded by Jesus in the Great Commandment in Matthew 22 is to be in awe of his majesty and marvel at his works. Matthew 22:36-37 Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law? And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your G*d with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. The people in and makers of this movie are not claiming to have infinite knowledge of G*d, they're using knowledge G*d revealed through His creation to show unbelievers that what Jesus taught is true. Psalm 19:1 The heavens declare the glory of G*d, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.",1468713600,7,2394,4.455580865603645

Not only would this never occur in the court of law but  the very premise on which she is charged is not one that would result in the effects that follow. This movie clearly was a Christian propaganda piece that pays no attention to the Establishment Clause or the SCOTUS cases that further define the clause. McCollum v. Board of Education Dist. 71, 333 U.S. 203 (1948)
Court finds religious instruction in public schools a violation of the establishment clause and therefore unconstitutional. Engel v. Vitale, 82 S.

Curlett, 374 U.S. 203 (1963) - Court finds forcing a child to participate in Bible reading and prayer unconstitutional. If it violates the Lemon Test- It violates the Establishment Clause: Lemon v.

7722687,3,B01DPW1A0I,"Its been just over two years since the movie Gods Not Dead came out.  When it came out on DVD, I saw it and wrote a review.  I wasn't a fan because Gods Not Dead wasn't a movie about Christianity; it was a movie about cultural Christianity.  It was a movie about the sort of shallow religiosity that I was taught when I was a teenager.

It was a movie where theism is the same as Christianity.

It was a movie where people become Christians without repenting of their sin or even mentioning Jesus at all.

It was a movie where the best part of the Christian life was attending a Christian Rock concert.

It was a movie where a freshman took on a PhD philosophy professor/atheist with a few pithy quotes and a couple of hours spent in a library.

Its no shock that I really disliked the first movie; it showed the state of evangelicalism and pretty much explained why I went to Heaven books are always on the best seller list.

So, was Gods Not Dead 2 any better?

Amazingly, yes.

Not by much, mind you, but it was betterand I went in expecting to hate it.

I admit, I was somewhat surprised.

So heres a summary:

THE MAIN PLOT:

The student is in class one day and asks the teacher if Ghandi and Martin Luther King were pacifists like Jesus was.  The teacher says yes and quotes Matt. 5:43-45.  The students parents somehow hear about it when a random boy sends them a text messageor something (the movie doesnt really explain how they found out).  So when the Dad and the Mom hear about the teacher making a passing reference about you-know-who from Nazareth, they go nuts and contact the school, which is run by the principal.

It seems that the students parents are angry atheists who pride themselves on their tolerance and threaten lawsuits against anyone who makes any statement of which they're intolerant.  That includes the teacher of their daughter (the student).  The daughter is going to go to an ivy league school and no teacher will get in the way, especially by making passing references to Jesus even though the teacher likes their daughter (the student) and is likely giving her an A+.

This whole mess leads to the ACLU getting involved.  The ACLU takes legal action against the teacher for her spouting of religious rhetoric.  They send in a horribly evil, God-hating atheist prosecuting attorney.  Hes just the bloodthirsty legal assassin the ACLU needs to make sure the teacher pays for her sins!

But theres hope for the teacher!  The defense attorney is a hot shot lawyer who is also an atheist, but not the angry or irrational kind.  He respects the teacher and wants to make a name for himself with a highly publicized court case.  If anyone can stop the ACLUs crack legal team, its an upstart rookie with next to no experience!

As one would expect, it ends up looking bad for the teacher when things don't turn her way, but after a bunch apologists take the stand and testify about how Christianity is reasonable, teenage kids sing How Great Thou Art and one of the Newsboys stops a concert to pray for the court case, the defense WINS!  The atheist lawyer throws in the towel and accepts defeat, especially after his own legal assistant points out that the defense proved the existence of Jesus!

Hooray!

THE SUB PLOTS:

The student has her own sub-plot.  Her brother died recently and she struggles to deal with the pain of the loss, but she asks Jesus into her heart for no discernible reason and then life gets betteruntil she screws up the court case royally.  Still, its a ""Christian"" movie and ends with everything all hunky dory.

The pastor has a bunch of bad stuff happen to him.  He has coffee spilled on him and spills his own coffee.  He spends a half day answering the bible questions of The Chinese exchange student.  He, and all the other pastors in their town, have their sermons subpoenaed for some reason, which is never explained (they don't mention why anyone wants their sermons).  The pastor willfully refuses to give his sermon transcripts to the authorities.  He also ends up with him on jury duty until his appendix bursts and then he watches the trial results from his hospital. Its assumed that he has ice cream at some point, but that isn't shown or even hinted at in the movie (I just made that part up).

The Chinese exchange student asks the pastor a bunch of Bible questions, gets slapped, and decides to become a pastor (if hes open to going to Singapore, I hear that Harvest City Church has some openings...at least until Kong Hee makes parole).

The Blogger has a crisis of faith after her cancer goes away and she realizes that she might not believe in God now that shes healed and has no need for him.  So, she does what all bloggers who have recovered from a life-threatening illness do: calls Michael Tait from the Newsboys!  He gives her encouragement and she then blogs about the whole court case with the teacher and the ACLU, but things start to look bad when the court case takes a turn for the worst.  So, she calls Michael Tait again during a concert and he takes the call, stops the concert, and then gets the audience to prayer for the teachers court case.  As the bible says: The prayers of a Newsboy are powerful and effective.

WHAT I LIKED:

Ill admit that after the first one, I went in expecting to hate this movie.  I wasn't a colossal fan, but I didn't hate it.

I think it was better than the first one as far as production values went, but Im not really a reliable critic with any worthwhile opinion on those sorts of technical or artistic things.

At least this movie mentioned Jesus and had a way better grade of apologetic presentation.  The sections in the courthouse where Lee Strobel and J. Warner Wallace were speaking was interesting enough that it might actually lead to some people investigating their work more.  Thats always welcome and their stuff is a decent enough entry-level defense of the Christian faith.  Ive reviewed Cold Case Christianity&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Case-Christianity-A-Homicide-Detective-Investigates-the-Claims-of-the-Gospels/dp/1434704696/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold-Case Christianity: A Homicide Detective Investigates the Claims of the Gospels</a>&nbsp;(by Wallace) on Amazon and its a book a gladly recommend.

The movie was also based on real court cases that have recently either gone through the courts or were on trial at the time of production.  In as much as the plot seemed far-fetched, I know that the sort of stuff in the movie actually happens.  It definitely doesnt play out like the movies (I don't think Lee Strobel and J. Warner Wallace ever show up in court as Christian experts), but its not nearly as far fetched as the first movie.

Finally, when the student has a crisis moment and asks Jesus into her heart, she mentions God forgiving her sin.  I don't know why she would have said that since she isn't told about her sin by the person whos sharing the gospel with her, but in this movie theres at least a passing mention of sin when someone prays the prayer.  Thats a step up from the first movie as well.

WHAT I DISLIKED:

The Christianity in the movie looks a lot like what I recognize as Christianity, but its not. Gods Not Dead 2 is another movie where the Christianity it portrays is simply cultural Christianity.  Its another movie about the sort of shallow religiosity that I was taught when I was a teenager.  Its another a movie where theism is the same as Christianity.

Its another movie where people who share the gospel don't really understand what the gospel message is, but deliver some sort of talk about God and Jesus and stuff and then people pray a prayer about Jesus coming into their heart and their lives get better (which seems to be the motivation behind the prayer).

Christianity is not a self-improvement seminar and anyone who thinks that is REALLY confused about basic truths of Christianity.

Its another movie that shows just how much influence the quack-theology of the Charismatic movement has had over Evangelicalism (not all their theology is bad, mind you).  Half the characters in the movie get direct propositional messages from God.  One of the characters in the movie got saved because she saw a church sign and God spoke to her through it and asked her who do you say that I am?  Nobody in the movie takes the Bible seriously or has any below-the-surface knowledge of it. They just pull out random feel-good verses and then do a subtle form of positive confession where they say them out loud and then tell God that they're trusting him to do whatever it is that they want (I think Rhonda Byrne saw this movie and contacted her lawyers to see if there was any actionable plagiarism).

All of that is just a reflection of the sad state of Christian culture, but Im not surprised.  The last few people who started coming to my church were openly shocked that my pastor preaches from the Bible in church.  They had apparently gone to other churches in the area and had trouble finding a church with a pastor who preached from the Bible (as in opened it, read it and tried to explain it).  That fact says bad things about the state of evangelicalism in my neck of the woods.

Still, there were two theological problems in the movie that Id like to point out:

The first problem was that when the teacher and the defending attorney were thinking about her offensive reference to Jesus, they had a landmark moment where they realized their winning strategy.  They realized that she was referencing Jesus as a historical figure, not the Jesus of the Bible (even though she was quoting the Bible at the time).  They went off about how one can talk about Christ as a pure historic figure, separate from the biblical accounts of him, and divorce that Jesus from the guy whos in the Bible.  Therefore, she was making a historical reference rather than a religious proclamation.

That, my readers, is exactly what the Liberals have been doing for over a century.  That is what's called separating the historical Jesus"" from the ""Christ of faith and whoever injected that into the movie needs to be graciously invited to take a long walk off a short pier.  I was really disturbed to see that sort of talk, but not really surprised.  Im guessing that nobody associated with the movie either had the theological chops to spot that problem, or thought it was a problem in the first place.  Still, the separation of the Jesus of History and the Jesus of Scripture always ends in the same outcome: you end up with history containing a version of Jesus who doesn't sound at all like the guy that the Bible talks about.

That brings me to the second problem: the minimal facts approach to defending Christs resurrection.  There was a scene where Rice Brooks and Gary Habermas are being interviewed by governor Mike Huckabee, and they talked about how almost all the experts agree about the facts surrounding Jesus resurrectiontherefore the resurrection itself is some sort of inescapable reality for ""honest"" skeptics.

What the movie didn't tell you is that Habermas approach presents the resurrection as the most likely hypothesis explaining 12 historic facts.

What are those facts?

1.  Jesus died by crucifixion.
2.  He was buried.
3.  His death caused the disciples to despair and lose hope.
4.  The tomb was empty (the most contested).
5.  The disciples had experiences which they believed were literal appearances of the risen Jesus (the most important proof).
6.  The disciples were transformed from doubters to bold proclaimers.
7.  The resurrection was the central message.
8.  They preached the message of Jesus resurrection in Jerusalem.
9.  The Church was born and grew.
10.  Orthodox Jews who believed in Christ made Sunday their primary day of worship.
11. James was converted to the faith when he saw the resurrected Jesus (James was a family skeptic).
12.  Paul was converted to the faith (Paul was an outsider skeptic).

Those are all the facts that are agreed upon by the experts.

Let me rephrase that: From all four gospels, which contain 89 chapters of historical record regarding the person and work of Jesus of Nazareth, experts can only agree on those 12 facts about Jesus resurrection.

Thats it.

So, you know what youve got?

Well, if you believe those 12 facts and conclude that Jesus rose from the dead, you still don't have anything close to Christianity.  You don't have a message explaining Christs atoning work on the cross, his imputed righteousness, his deity, his miracles (which validated his claims about his person and work), God doing the resurrecting, or anything of relevance to the Gospel whatsoever.  You only have a eccentric ancient Jewish teacher getting killed for some reason and rising from the dead, for other vague and mysterious reasons.

That's it.

Thats never going to get you to any form of Biblical Christianity.  Thats one of the reasons why I only defend Christianity as Christianity.  There are no baby steps to Biblical Christianity and belief is a work of divine grace, in response to the Spirit-empowered word of God penetrating the heart.  I don't pretend the Bible is semi-rational to the disbelieving mind; its not.  The Bible says that the gospel is foolishness to the disbelieving (1 Cor. 2:14) and I believe the Bible.

The whole thing.

Also, Habermas whole project is horribly flawed.  What Habermas doesnt tell you is that an overwhelming majority of the experts don't agree with his conclusions at all (seeing that around 90% New Testament and Biblical ""scholars"" in the world are self-professed unbelievers), and the minimal facts approach only has a hypothetical chance as long as theres scholarly consensus regarding the minimal facts.  The scholarly consensus changes regularly, and Ive heard lists of minimal facts that contain anywhere from 12 facts to 7.  Once scholars get wind of what Habermas doing (as if they even care about a guy that they would consider a fundamentalist joke), they can shut down his whole process by simply changing the consensus.

Believe it or not, the resurrection of Jesus would be true even if every single religious studies professors at every community college thought Jesus was a Vietnamese goat.

CONCLUSION:

Should you see Gods Not Dead?

Sure.  Watch it with your kids.

Why not?

Its not that bad, and the mediocre messages it gives you are coming at you from far more than Christianmovies.  Besides, its definitely way better than most of the other schlock that Hollywood is pushing out.  Theres a bunch of good messages you can take from it:

It shows that prayer works.

It  shows people quoting the Bible when they have struggles.

It  shows that Christians can intelligently stand up for what they believe in.

It shows that Gods highly involved in the lives of everyone he touches.

It shows that Christians being thoughtful and supportive of one another in difficulties.

It shows Christians standing up for their faith in the face of violent opposition.

Take those messages from it, and talk about those messages with whomever you watch the movie with.

7722693,5,B01DPW1A0I,"I have watched this movie in the movie mall, and it exceeded all my expectations in depicting the reality of the Christian persecution in America. When I was undergraduate, it was acceptable to speak about any religion except the Christian Faith. If anyone mentioned the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, no one would imagine the amount of blasphemous and insults that were usually heaped at the Lord and that person. When I went to medical school, things were not much better. So, when I watched what happened to the teacher for saying the Truth about the Divinity of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ, I felt that finally someone was able to capture what happens to Christians whether students or professors if they dared to commit the unpardonable sin of declaring the Divinity of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ as the teacher on this film did. Another, true aspect of the movie I'd the the ACLU lawyer who was vehemently against the teacher because she dared give the student the politically incorrect answer to the student's question, the ACLU are willing to defend any Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist group to express themselves freely but if someone dares to mention the Name of Our Lord and God Jesus Christ or mention any Bible verse, they are usually jumping to sniff off the Christian voice claiming separation of Church and State which never meant that God's name shouldn't be mentioned in public or else someone like George Washington, James Madison, John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln and so on, wouldn't have mentioned God's name as they used to do. I liked the statement , "" I prefer to stand with God and be judged by the world than stand with the world and be judged by God. This statement captures the strength of every True Christian.
  What is more amazing is the dominance of the Christian message regardless of the persecutions that the faithfully Christians have been subjected to. That was so clear in the Roman Empire that kept killing and torturing the Christians for the first three centuries of the Christian Era,  only to have the Christian Faith spreading by leaps and bounds throughout the Roman Empire and at the end, the Christian Faith came out victorious and where is the Roman Empire but in the trash of history. Great movie and great acting.
  A truly honest motion pictures, that captures the power of Faith.

7722695,2,B01DPW1A0I,"in early April, 2016, ""God's Not Dead 2"" opened in theaters across the US. Despite the ""2"" in its title, the film isn't really a sequel GND, the original. It's an exploitive follow-up to it. Both releases feature marginal film actors and represent a new genre in Christian filmmaking: the cinema of imaginary persecution. Like its predecessor, it has a one-dimensional and unbelievable script and is at best modestly acted.

""God's Not Dead 2"" concerns a public high school teacher who is hauled into court for answering a student's innocuous question about Jesus by citing one of Jesus's admonitions to his disciples. The teacher is played by Melissa Joan Hart, who finds herself in a legal battle after she mentions the historical significance of Jesus in the classroom. This opens up an avenue for using a court trial to debate the existence of God and the truth of biblical accounts. This is something that could not happen in an American courtroom, but is rather common in the sort of public debates from years back where, for example, the late atheist Christopher Hitchens and evangelical scholars would square off, presenting their cases. Back to the movie: in the trailer, a pastor is shown handcuffed and dragged off to jail for no believable reason. Wisely, in the final version, the producers decided this incident was just too unbelievable and removed it. As released, GND2 has a messy plot that takes on more material than it can handle, and it engages its subject via clumsy and blunt means. The exercise of religious liberties in contemporary American society is indeed an important and relevant issue, but the dramatic portrayal of it has to be grounded in believable events and legal procedures that could actually occur.

As such, Gods Not Dead 2 probably won't do much more than preach to the choir, and even the choir might find itself cringing at the films heavy-handed execution. Courtroom dramas are notorious for long-winded speeches and preachy content, but Gods Not Dead 2 has an especially annoying habit of using lengthy speeches for tedious exposition. It often feels like you're watching someone read an op-ed piece to you on screen. That isn't compelling film making, no matter what the issue at hand.

But the film will surely find an audience among right wing fundamentalists who have been convincing themselves in the age of Obama that they are being ""persecuted."" Indeed, it is in the present historical moment that the film gains its attraction for its target audience; otherwise it has little or no credibility. In other words, it is a cultural artifact or by-product of the continuing culture wars in the US.

Christian persecution in our times? Really? Well this ain't North Korea and ISIS dominated territories we are talking about here. Religion in America never had it so good. Here are some of the real privileges that fundamentalist christian organizations enjoy:

* They receive complete tax exemption by mere dint of their existence. Unlike other non-profits, houses of worship, ministerial groups and religious entities don't have to apply for tax-exempt status. They are assumed to have it upon their formation.

* They are exempt from mandatory financial reporting laws. Most secular non-profits must once a year file a detailed financial document (a Form 990) with the IRS that must be made available for public inspection. Houses of worship are exempt from this requirement.

* Special laws govern church audits. Secular groups can be audited at the merest suspicion of wrong-doing. By act of Congress, proposed audits for houses of worship are subjected to heightened scrutiny. All church audits must be approved by a high-ranking IRS official.

* Non-religious non-profits are restricted in the amount of lobbying they can do at the federal level. Under federal law, churches and their ""integrated auxiliary"" groups are exempt from these regulations. They are not required to report how much lobbying they do or how much they spend to do it. Only a handful of states apply any oversight to church lobbying.

* Religious groups are often treated with great deference by secular authorities. It is often difficult to bring the leaders of large and powerful religious groups to justice when they have clearly committed crimes.

Most progressive, moderate and non-paranoid conservative faith leaders acknowledge their position of privilege and realize they have little grounds to complain in this free nation where we place a great premium on freedom of conscience. (Indeed many US religious leaders, instead of crying about phony persecution in the United States, spend their time advocating on behalf of people in other countries who suffering from real forms of religious persecution.)

It's the right-wing fundamentalists who won't stop bawling about ""persecution."" So what really is this ""persecution""? More often than not, it's one of two things: spirited opposition to right wing fundamentalist attempts who want to run our lives or reasonable requests from non-Christian or non-theistic groups for some of the same rights the fundamentalists take for granted.

Remember some of the recent flaps over Muslim groups seeking the right to build and open mosques? In one Tennessee county, Muslims had to fight in court for years for that right. How often does this happen to Christian groups in America?

Or think about the situation that is currently playing out in at a public high school in Franklin County, Tenn. Students there have launched a Gay-Straight Alliance (GSA) and seek the same right to meet that is already extended to two Christian clubs at the school. Some people in town have raised such a fuss that the school board is considering placing restrictions on student groups with the aim of shutting out the GSA. The Liberty Counsel, a Religious Right group run by attorney Mat Staver, has offered to assist the school board in its scheme to find a way to snuff the GSA out of existence. Hey, talk about being dragged into court!!

Incidents like this expose groups like the Liberty Counsel and the larger Religious Right movement for the hypocrites that they are. Imagine the stink Staver would be raising right now if this school were trying to stop conservative Christian students from meeting. He'd be huffing and puffing and threatening a lawsuit, yet he doesn't want an identically situated non-religious student group to have that right - even though a federal law guarantees it to them.

Finally, please know that ""God's Not Dead 2"" wasn't screened for critics prior to release, a normative practice in the film industry. This is a sure sign that the makers of GND2 knew they had made a film with very limited appeal. Doubt me? The film has an abysmal 14 percent ""fresh"" rating on the Rotten Tomatoes film review site. Of course, for believers in the right wing fundamentalist christianist persecution fantasy, this is another ""proof"" that ""secular elites"" will attack any Christian cultural enterprise these days. It just convinces them that there is more persecution, despite facts to the contrary!",1463961600,9,7076,5.077452667814113

7722699,4,B01DPW1A0I,"Released in 2016, ""God's Not Dead 2"" is a courtroom drama revolving around a public school teacher (Melissa Joan Hart) being sued for innocently quoting Jesus Christ in response to a historical question from a student (Hayley Orrantia). Her parents press charges, hiring an atheistic lawyer (Ray Wise). Will free speech prevail or will the voice of Christians be squelched? Jesse Metcalfe plays the teacher's agnostic young lawyer while Pat Boone plays her aging father. There are a few subplots, including one about a Chinese student's newfound faith and making a stand in response to his father's rejection.

This stand-alone sequel is about on par with 2014's ""God's Not Dead."" It just switches the locale from college to high school and the courtroom, as well as changes the conflict from a student standing up to his professor to a teacher standing up to the government. While the antagonism against the film is expected, it's mostly not credible since this is a solid drama that addresses real-life issues, whether people want to pretend they don't exist or not. Take, for instance, the subplot about pastors being subpoenaed by civic authorities to turn in copies of their sermons. This is an example of mass thought-control and really happened in Houston. As far as teachers being heavily dissuaded from mentioning Jesus Christ or quoting the Bible, this is now a widespread phenomenon and it's only a matter of time before there's a landmark court case on the issue, like in the movie.

Although ""God's Not Dead 2"" may not be great like 2015's ""War Room"" or near-great like 2008's ""Fireproof,"" it's a solid Christian drama about real-life issues with a potent moral, not to mention Hayley, Melissa and Metcalfe make for quality protagonists (you can't help but root for them). The second act starts to lag, but the final act is compelling enough and makes up for it.

7722703,1,B01DPW1A0I,"So we have a public school teacher who's sued by the ACLU for referencing Jesus and scripture in her history class. The teacher ultimately wins because she proves God exists. This only proves that the movie was made by people who have no understanding of how the law works.

In real life, the issue would be whether there was a violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution. (The establishment clause is the part that says that the government may not promote or hinder one religion relative to another one, or religion in general relative to non-religion in general. This is the reason why prayer and Bible reading in public schools are illegal. I trust that there are many people who will see this film who wish for there not to be a separation of church and state, but the First Amendment actually mandates such a separation.) Therefore, it wouldn't be the teacher getting sued, it would be the public school system getting sued - in real life, this would not be the crusade of one woman for faith against the Satanic ACLU. But the makers of this movie seem to believe that the way you respond to an allegation that you violated the establishment clause is by proving God exists. The problem is that one has nothing to do with the other. Whether God exists or not, that doesn't mean that the government gets to violate the establishment clause. If you're going to make a movie that endeavors to prove a legal point, you have to do so by making legal arguments, and ""God's not dead, He's surely alive"" is not a legal argument. It's perfectly valid to believe that God exists, but it's not a valid response to an establishment clause action.

And if I were representing the ACLU in this case, I would object to every single thing Lee Strobel said on the witness stand (if he were even allowed to testify, which, in real life, I doubt he would be) on the basis of relevance, because, again, whether God exists has nothing to do with whether the government violated the establishment clause. Would this mean I was discriminating against Christians? Hardly. It just means that if you're going to try to prove your point legally in federal court (and again, whether God exists is NOT a legal issue, nor an affirmative defense to an establishment clause violation), you need to understand things like the federal rules of civil procedure, and the federal rules of evidence.

The funny thing is, based on what the teacher says in this movie, the government probably DIDN'T violate the establishment clause. I appreciate that. I don't normally associate this kind of movie with nuance or subtlety, but the fact that the teacher's comments were something of a constitutional gray area was unexpectedly credible; I expected the teacher to say something that flagrantly violated the establishment clause, with the moral of the story being that it was okay because God's not dead, He's surely alive. I seriously doubt that this was anything more than an accident, but I still think that was to the film's immense credit.

Movies like this portray the law in ways that are completely incorrect, and despite that, any number of people who see this film will likely trust that this is actually how the legal system works. It's the spreading of misinformation like this, deliberately or not, that makes movies like this so counterproductive; all it's going to do at the end of the day is make it that much harder for people on either side of the issue to communicate with each other.",1461369600,41,3503,4.728314238952537

I hope someday Christians see that we need to stand up for what is right and pull our kids out of public school. There are so many disgraceful brainwashing techniques in place in the public schools. They are now teaching ""gay history"" in all the California public schools and also in CA there is the issue of transgender people being able to use any bathroom or dressing room without proof of being transgender so in other words any guy or girl can choose whichever bathroom or dressing room suits them that particular day. Did I mention this is for kindergarten through 12th grade!?  Satan is getting quite a grip (more like a choke hold) on some of our states' leadership.

Because Arkansas is just brimming with atheists who freak out when someone mentions Jesus. Never mind that there was absolutely nothing wrong with what Grace did in answering the question put to her by a student. Character after character said that Grace had done nothing wrong and, guess what? It's the only thing they got right! Is there anyone out there asking themselves why this wasn't based on any actual case? Could it be because this is all complete nonsense?

When the movie isn't pushing stereotypes it's working really hard on the propaganda. They pull Lee Strobel out of a hat and get him on the stand to burp up a bunch of gobbledygook. How about the evil atheist lawyer from the ACLU who just hates what Grace stands for? What a menace! What garbage. This movie is all about playing the victim in an evil, backward world that doesn't exist. I wish they'd join us in reality.",1461196800,33,1006,4.620111731843576

Was it really all that bad to answer a question comparing their methods to what Jesus taught? Apparently, yes. Teacher Grace Wesley has gotten into so much trouble for that half a minute where she let herself quote God's Word in a public school. Now it'll take great courage, others' encouragement, and, most importantly, God's help to prove to the jury that her license does not need to be revoked and to the world that the Bible can be discussed in the classroom.

""God's Not Dead 2"", the sequel to ""God's Not Dead"", explores whether or not teachers - or anyone else, for that matter - can discuss God and Christianity openly. While the beginning was not overly interesting, the ending gripped my emotions. However, like a good friend of mine told me, it would be nice to see more nice and polite non-believers, instead of making most of them pretty vehement about their stance against Christianity. ""God's Not Dead 2"" dives into a topic that is well in need of a discussion.",1460851200,8,1096,4.649484536082475

Anyway, about the movie. I love Melissa Joan Hart and I think she probably had a different design on where her life would take her. She's good in this role and not as overbearing and preachy as most of the actors get in these types of movies.

Among the strong arguments in the movie are 1)  events at the core of the Bible can be (and have been) supported by historians across the theological aisle, 2) that separation of Church and State was a guarantee from Thomas Jefferson to the Baptist church of non-interference from the government, 3) that the New Testament accounts in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are forensically secure accounts from eye witnesses according to modern court-accepted science.

7722716,3,B01DPW1A0I,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
God's Not Dead 2
 Scoffers, doubters and deniers don't like this fine film very much.  They actually don't like any faith film, so we are not surprised at their reaction.  Also not surprising is their reaction to the previous film by the same makers, ""God's not Dead"".  The scoffers, doubters and deniers didn't like it either but the faith community took that little $1.5 million dollar film to an amazing $68 million at the box office.
 This one, in terms of production values, is much better.  In terms of message, it is just as strong.
 The stakes are higher in this saga of a teacher in the path of a ferocious attack on her faith by the ACLU.  Ray Wise, a familiar face from oodles of supporting roles, plays the lawyer from that organization.  He must have had fun with his role.  He has the lawyer come across to us as a person as close to Mephistopheles as possible for a human, but  without over doing it and slipping into parody.  This is finely drawn acting.  Mellisa Joan Hart plays the ordinary teacher caught in a legal vice.  I am not used to seeing her as an adult after her youthful success in teen roles on TV but she is a competent professional actress.  The teacher is accused of preaching in a public school room.  What she actually did was to answer a student's question about the similarity of the thoughts of Gandi, M.L. King and Jesus.  The teacher somewhat naively answered her question, leading to the sticky wicket.
 We do discover that the government can and will bring down a crushing weight on a citizen if it so desires.  The teacher faces job loss-and likely no chance of teaching again anywhere-staggering legal bills and fines so extreme as to wipe out a life's work.  Lucky for her the teacher's union sends a smart if inexperienced young lawyer to help her out, played by TV star Jesse Metcalfe (and also starred in the successful feature film ""John Tucker Must Die"").
 What follows is a court room drama rolled out in a workman like way.  We never expect the teacher to suffer conviction so that kind of  dramatic tension never builds up.  We watch to see just how things play out, never in doubt as to the eventual result.  It is in a sense as predictable as a Western.  We know the good guys will win in the end.  Watch for a surprise as the jury exits.
 82 year old Pat Boone has a role as the house mate and grand dad of the teacher.  Not only was it fun to see the old guy again but he had a great line.  ""Atheism takes away hope without taking away the pain"" which I thought a sharp comment.  Robin Givins plays the school principal with the proper amount of officious turf guarding.  Ernie Hudson (""Ghost Busters"") rules the courtroom as the judge.  The late ex-senator Fred Thompson has a small role, his last.  18 year old Sadie Robertson, the offspring of Willie and Korie Robertson, appears here in her first feature film role.  Willie and Korie appeared in the first film.  All are famous for the ""Duck Dynisty"" TV show.
 Director Harold Cronk and writers chuck Konzelman and Cary Solomon are all returned to their spots with the first film.  Besides the two ""God's not Dead"" films Konzelman and Solomon also co-wrote such diverse films as ""Point Blank"" and ""Earth vs the Spiders"".
 The three day opening week end brought in around $8 million, not at all bad for a film with a tiny $5 million budget.  This is a solid ""PG"" family friendly film with no objectionable words or views.  It runs a good long two hours and one minute.  This well acted film gets an average three out of five saw blades.  Pure Flix Entertainment has shown that a strong film can be made which appeals to the faith community for a minuscule amount of money.  Twice now.
 A reference was made in the movie to a recent attempt to censure sermons from the pulpit.  In Huston Texas the city actually demanded copies of sermons from the churches there.  In the credits a scroll of a score of court cases similar to the fictional one in the film rolled by.  These cases were defended by the Alliance Defending Freedom.",1459814400,57,4072,4.476190476190476
