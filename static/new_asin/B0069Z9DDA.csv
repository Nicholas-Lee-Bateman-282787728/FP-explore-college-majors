8495603,5,B0069Z9DDA,"Stunning sequences, some of them approaching studio CGI quality with a vastly smaller hardware budget than the major studios have.  In a few more years, amateurs may represent a serious disruptive threat to Hollywood, since mass-market graphics hardware just keeps getting better.",1417737600,,280,5.666666666666667
8495604,3,B0069Z9DDA,"There always seems to be some ""must to have"" demos from these compilations, but still a good pies of demo scene culture in here!",1408492800,,128,4.375
8495605,4,B0069Z9DDA,"Enjoyed it greatly, and 60fps is something I had never seen on a BluRay and it definitely helps showing off the demos, but it doesn't look like the compression process was authored very much. I understand that demos with patterns and fast moving objects, etc, are hard to get right at all with video compression, but some are blocky as hell. Taking off a star for that. Otherwise, totally worth it if you're into the demoscene.",1358726400,,427,4.631578947368421
