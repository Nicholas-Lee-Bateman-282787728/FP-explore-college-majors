8446346,4,B004X6U82M,"First of all I suppose the thing many people will need to know is that, apart from their vocal aspect, the performances of the old Cream numbers, with the exception of 'White Room', are very poor and not really worth having - not if you really understand what was so special about Cream that is. Much as I love the live Cream versions of these (or at least the selected performances available on CD, 'wolfgangsvault', and even some very bad sounding bootlegs) I have to force myself to get through them here. But this is true unfortunately of almost all the post-Cream performances given by Bruce, along with ALL the performances by Clapton, of tracks like 'Sunshine', 'Politician', 'White Room' and 'Spoonful' - or at least those performances which have been made available through recordings.
'White Room' however, as I've said, is quite successful, at least as good as the one on 'Live Cream Vol 2' and mercifully free of wah-wah, although it's a pity there's no vocal reprise given that Jack's singing has always been the main selling point of this number. The most exciting impro of 'White Room' I have heard on disc is included on the bootleg quality collection called 'Farewell Tour 1968' disc, despite the technical problems when the bass cuts out for a while and the poor quality sound. I would also recommend the re-mix/remaster to be found on the box-set 'Those Were the Days' over the more familiar one on 'LC Vol. 2'
But at least I can say that in this concert Jack is also on fine form vocally in 'Sunshine of Your Love' and 'Politician', and would appear to be on good form on 'NSU' as well, except that, for this and 'Spoonful' which make up the encore after a short break offstage, Jack's microphone isn't working. In fact vocally in many of these numbers he seems as good as he's ever been live and that is saying a lot. I particularly regret the loss of the vocals on the rarely heard 'NSU' because Clempson seems to be doing better with his vocal support on this than with some of his attempts at guitar solos - he comes across loud and clear because his microphone is working.
The problem in 'Sunshine', 'Politician' and 'Spoonful' is the tedious 'improvisations' where everyone seems to be just going through the motions, once you've seen through the conventional mechanics of the guitarist who always seems to want to play high up on the neck feigning an ecstasy the improvisation hasn't earned. There is so much more that could be done with them. Even the bass lines are uninteresting, perhaps because Jack has nothing to respond to and so seems entirely to be marking time repeating the riff with minimal variation while waiting for something to happen. In the old days with Cream he would respond with dazzling speed to Clapton and often pursue him with imitative counterpoint, or he would compete by playing complex variations of the riff. Here he is completely grounded by the lack of direction displayed by both of his guitarists and keyboard players. Cobham on drums is equally grounded and monotonous in these pointless instrumental bashes.

The real interest in this concert is in the post-Cream material mostly taken from 'I've Always Wanted To Do This'. I've had issues with some of the later studio recordings because, despite the often amazing vocals, so many of them suffer from the fashions of 80s production, such as the drum machine and synth brass, and much of it is far too controlled and artificial. But this album from the end of the 70s, which slipped under the radar for most people, is one of the best solo albums, and is still strong in the arrangements, in the material, and vocally. I can't say that this concert adds anything by way of the playing or the arrangements, in fact it is much less accomplished, but it does offer extra interest where Jack is actually singing, and especially when at the same time playing bass. I just wish the sound picked out the bass better, unfortunately it's not a lot better than Palmer's film of the 1968 Farewell Concert film in that respect but if you listen in 5.1 with a subwoofer it does sound a lot better, as does the '68 Concert, even though neither of them was originally recorded in 5.1.

And I just wish we could have heard Jack on this sort of vocal form a lot more often when performing live with his various bands post-Cream. This is good evidence for what Jack looked, and sounded, like in his prime - although the 1968 Albert Hall Farewell Concert DVD supplies the essential core evidence, despite many off-putting real time visual edits, excessive close-ups and poor sound.
By any other standards I would have given this 5 stars but by Jack Bruce's own best standard I have to give it 4, but that doesn't mean that there aren't numbers, and parts of numbers here, that deserve 5, and you shouldn't have any doubt that I think the best parts to be among the best that rock music has been capable of. Here you WILL find plenty that shows him in tremendous form which amounts to a kind of genius for those who can see it.
I have said elsewhere that Jack Bruce was at this time still the young Beethoven of rock and some of the evidence for that is found in this concert. It comes down to a certain heroic authority and nobility that naturally comes across when he is true to himself, combining self-consciousness and risk-taking. Dionysus and Apollo are in balance in Jack Bruce when he is performing at his best, that is to say when Dionysus hasn't taken control. Hearing him perform like this is genuinely exhilarating, and even more so when you can see him as well. The type of rock we have here is genuinely unique and one can say that it is almost a kind of (intelligent and noble) Punk before Punk - as different from the later hardcore Punk as The Police and early Blondie would also be in their way.
The solo concert at the piano from 1990 is extraordinary and shows how nuanced his singing can be and how he can stand comparison with any singer-songwriter in this medium, and in many ways surpass them. This live performance is much more involving than the studio recorded CD called 'Monkjack' of the same, similarly presented, material - the singing is actually better live.

These two concerts were previously issued in a 2-DVD set called 'Jack Bruce at Rockpalast' which included another concert on a separate disc. The concerts in this single disc reissue are the essential ones. The other one from 1983 with a three piece band, often making use of two keyboards, is rather self-indulgent and strained and cannot be recommended. I didn't find it enjoyable at all - a great pity since it includes the only post-Cream performances on disc of 'I'm So Glad', and for 'NSU' except for one by BBM.
Surprisingly for such an old recording the first concert really does benefit from being heard in 5.1 as it helps the voice and bass to register better.

Anyone who is really interested in hearing the old Cream numbers done as they should be and who already has the authorised live Cream recordings should go to wolfgangsvault where they will find alternative performances of 'Crossroads', 'Sunshine', 'Spoonful' and 'I'm So Glad' along with the same old live versions familiar from CDs.
Two of the authorised releases are rather obscure: an alternative live version of 'NSU' can be found on the 'Those Were The Days' boxed set, and another live 'Sunshine', from 1968, can be heard on a rare Clapton CD-EP where it was included as a sort of 'bonus' track.

Please note that when I refer to Cream I am NOT including the Cream 'reunion' of 2005 which only served to distract people from the real thing which all happened 1967-68.",1346889600,2,7631,4.653817642698295

8446348,5,B004X6U82M,"[JACK BRUCE - GOLDEN DAYS - (1980 + 1990) - Approx. 180 minutes] From the Rockpalast vaults comes this tasty treat for all of Jack's fans; two entirely different performances, each equally good, for entirely different reasons. The 1980 show features his stellar lineup with Clem Clempson (Coliseum, Humble Pie) on guitar, Billy Cobham (Mahavishnu Orchestra, Pieces of Dreams) on drums and David Sancious (B. Springsteen, Sting, P. Gabriel, Jeff Beck, etc.) on keyboards, lead guitar and bass - nothing short of a supergroup, yet especially sensitive to the material penned by Bruce, who nonetheless gives his bandmates considerable room to stretch out for the benefit of all.

Sure, the core of the material here is from the 'I've Always Wanted To Do This' album with all the aforementioned players, but staples like 'White Room', 'N.S.U.', 'Politician' 'Spoonful', 'Sunshine' and 'Theme' are also well-treated by this band, never straying far from the roots of the tunes many of us grew up with. Cobham is brilliant, hiding behind an enormous kit that made me initially think he was going to overplay, as I have seen him play live about a dozen times, and occasionally he does, but he's spot on here, even tuning his toms to get Ginger's sound, and utilizing three snare drums with various tunings for all the various material. Sancious thankfully goes light with the synth sounds, which would sound dated today otherwise, keeping mostly to piano, an occasional bass part and a fiery solo on 'Theme For an Imaginary Western' that Jack dedicates to Felix Pappalardi. No matter how many times I hear that tune, I still get chills, whether Jack's playing it solo on piano or whether Mountain's supercharging it with the verve and panache we've all come to associate with this number, one of the most beautiful and majestic tunes I've ever heard. The restraint is abandoned, however, by the time the end of the set nears and the band tears up 'Bird Alone', bringing down the house with Jack's uncanny ability to play blistering basslines while simultaneously belting out vocals that would leave most singers soiled in a puddle of bodily fluids as Cobham solos like he's sparring with McLaughlin again. Amazingly inspired pyrotechnics that still never abandon the tune itself in a vain display of ability. And everyone appears to be enjoying themselves greatly, if not downright proud to be there. As it should be. And there you have it - breathtaking archival material.

The audio is very good, a bit short of great, but the video is somewhat grainy in spots and the contrast is lacking, but this should come as no surprise given the age of the tape source and no remastering has been attempted. Once in a while, the audio and video get out of synch for a spot here and there, but never too long to remain grating. The most dated thing embarrassingly evident are the backup singers (?) who look as comfortable as a bed of nails, are as necessary as sterilizing a needle prior to lethal injection and are as disposable as Kleenex. Yeah, I'm a petty, caustic SOB, but what'cha gonna do?

The set from 1990 is just Jack and his piano, and here we have convincing evidence of the conviction, heartfelt delivery and raw strength of a master songwriter's honesty and integrity I no longer see in most (any?) of today's songsmiths. There's a naked sincerity on display, a variation of vocal phrasing that proves a fearlessness to expose one's self and the intricacies of the compositions that insures a continued interest throughout the entire show. Never for a moment does your attention wander or drift while Jack unveils his vast catalog's wellspring; if he weren't so damned impressive, we'd be squirming in our seats instead of adhered to them. Tracks like 'Can You Follow' 'Third Degree', 'Flying', 'Weird of Hermiston' and again, 'Theme', all bone chillingly rendered by a consummate professional. As has been said recently, Clapton may have had his reign as 'God' in the 60's while (and only) with Cream, but Jack Bruce has accomplished so much more as a songwriter and musician in a variety of aggregations that he truly was the soul of rock's first and arguably finest supergroup.

The audio and video (naturally) are crisper than the earlier performance, and Jack is enjoying himself immensely when he comes down from his ethereal songwriting cloud - again, no matter how many times I see him live, he's a joy to behold. Clocking in at nearly 3 hours, all Jack junkies need to enjoy the 'Golden Days' presented here. While you're at it, bag his biography, 'Jack Bruce - Composing Himself' as well - it's an excellent read about a marvelous man and iconic figure.
Viva la Bruce!",1336608000,3,4678,4.865746549560853
