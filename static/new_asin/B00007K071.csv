7977247,4,B00007K071,"This 1974 release was a box office failure. CATHERINE's die hard fans will remember that at that time she was the CHANEL  no 5 woman on television commercials. This supernatural story directed by JUAN BUNUEL is interesting in parts,but not satisfying as a whole. Such supernatural films were rare in FRENCH cinema at that time. However, those who admire CATHERINE DENEUVE's stunning figure(a lot of us guys belong in this group)will be in heaven watching this. CATHERINE's legendary blonde hair is much on display throughout,and there's a famous unexpected nude scene. Girls ,if your boyfriend or husband's fantasy is DENEUVE in her prime,buy him this and let him enjoy while you do the shopping with his money. He'll forget about the change.",1039824000,7,742,5.081967213114754
