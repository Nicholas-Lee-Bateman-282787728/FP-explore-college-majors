3846686,5,B0024FABCG,"Pushing Daisies was my favorite show of all time. I am still shocked and exceedingly mad that they cancelled such an amazing show. This show had it all comedy, mystery, drama, and romance. As the previous review stated it is a huge mistake made by ABC. Every week I got soo excited when this came on and would tell everyone to leave me alone until it was over. I found the witty banter very entertaining. Also, Ned and Chuck's love story was so sweet. I'm getting this to show my mom just how wonderful this show is since she missed it on tv.",1247097600,26,542,4.271844660194175
3846687,5,B0024FABCG,"There is no more tragic early cancellation in the history of television than ABC's ill-advised and ultimately baffling ending of PUSHING DAISIES.  One of the finest shows in the history of television, DAISIES in its first, strike interrupted season garnered critical acclaim and honors to match any show on television.  It was named one of the American Film Institute's Ten Best Shows of 2007.  It received more Emmy nominations than any series on television.  It made every critic's Top Ten or Top Five list in 2007.  Then it came back for the beginning of the 2008-2009 season and turned out to be even better than in its debut season.  But like most of the shows that did not go back into production following the writers strike of 2007-2008, it failed to gain back its audience.  With the Wall Street crisis and the general economic malaise ABC panicked and did something that with hindsight it will certainly regret:  cancelled not just its best show, but arguably the best show ABC had ever produced.

PUSHING DAISIES is a television series of rare beauty and exceptional magic.  It starts with the look.  Visually its only parallels are not other series, but movies like AMELIE or BABE or the films of Tim Burton.  The colors are vibrant, impossibly bright, almost penetrating.  Every shot almost overwhelms you with its gorgeousness.  Nearly the first shot shows young Ned, later to be the Pie Maker, running with his dog Digby through an impossibly beautiful field of bright yellow flowers.  That sets the tone for the entire series.  Almost every shot is lush, almost (but not quite) overdone.  The music is a perfect match for the sets and colors, at times tragic, sometimes romantic, always full of yearning.

But what makes DAISIES especially memorable is its success at attempting to be a romantic fairy tale.  Ned, the Pie Maker, has a gift.  He can bring any dead thing back to life merely by touching it.  It is, however, a circumscribed gift.  Whatever he touches can only live a minute without consequences, namely, that something else must time in its place.  Not only that, but if he touches anything a second time, it then dies again, this time forever.  In the very first episode Ned learns that his childhood sweetheart, Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles, was murdered.  In concert with his partner, detective Emerson Cod, he goes to the funeral home to touch his beloved and discover her killer's identity.  In one of the loveliest scenes I've ever seen on television, Ned with subdued passion touches his childhood love, brings her back to live, but then finds it impossible to touch her again within the requisite minute.  Someone else dies in her place, she lives, but with the qualifier that he can never touch his true love again, lest she die for good.

There is no more poignant love story ever on television (with one exception, surprisingly the Sci-fi series FARSCAPE, in the story of Aeryn Sun and the two Crichtons - anyone who loves a great romance should check that series out - but be patient, the big payoff doesn't come until midway in Season Three, whereas PUSHING DAISIES is extraordinary right out of the gate).  Two people who love each other purely and passionately, but who can never touch directly.

But PUSHING DAISIES is far richer than just the love story of the Pie Maker and a girl called Chuck.  The show features one of the most talented and brilliant casts ever assembled.  Broadway legend Kristin Chenoweth (who, yes, sings a few songs on the series) plays pie waitress Olive Snook, a retired high stakes jockey who is hopelessly in love with Ned.  But Ned is does not love the girl he can touch but the one he cannot.  I remain absolutely incredulous that Chenoweth did not win the Emmy for Best Supporting Actress (I'm even more incredulous that the woman playing Christina Applegate's mother on SAMANTHA WHO? Did - I'd be happy for anyone to watch the two shows side by side and explain that one to me).  I love Olive Snook, with her frustrated love, her impossibly infectious smile, and her wide array of waitressing miniskirts.  Equally as good is Chi McBride as detective Emerson Cod.  Verbally dexterous, colorfully and loudly and colorfully (yes, the adjective bears repeating) dressed, and possessed a love for money, knitting and pop up books, and his long lost daughter, Emerson Cod delivers many of the show's best lines and has a tendency to steal nearly every scene he is in.  Chuck's aunts also play a wonderful in the series, two retired synchronized swimmers who performed as the Darling Mermaid Darlings, Vivian and Lily Charles.  They are played by two great Broadway veterans, Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene (in fact, it was Kurtz who presented Chenoweth with her Tony that she won for YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN).  But holding their own with this exceptional collection of talent are Lee Pace as Ned and Anna Friel as Chuck.  Friel is another of the seemingly endless stream of British or Australian actors populating American TV, but unlike some, you'd never guess.  She brings great charm and pathos to the role of the Alive Again girl, just as Lee Pace, who many will know from an earlier series by DAISIES creator Bryan Fuller called WONDERFALLS.  And last, but not least, the cast is rounded out by The Narrator, voiced by the great Jim Dale, whom many will know as the voice for the Harry Potter audio books.  In fairness I have to report that some people don't like the Narrator.  I also have to report that I can make no sense of that.  Dale's narration in my estimation makes a very special series even more special.

What doesn't this show have?  The writing is simply as good as you could ever hope to find on TV.  And do you love words?  Few shows in the history of TV evince a love of words to match PUSHING DAISIES.  Perhaps BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and Joss Whedon's other shows, with Whedon's unremitting obsession with the games you can play with words.  Or Amy Sherman-Palladino's THE GILMORE GIRLS.  In fact, I would be willing to bet that the two shows in the history of TV that contain more words per minute than any others are PUSHING DAISIES and THE GILMORE GIRLS.  Both shows feature people talking fast yet very, very well.  If you love words, you will love PUSHING DAISIES.

And if you love romance, you will love PUSHING DAISIES.  In tone it is a comedy, with piles and piles of wonderfully funny moments.  But at its heart, it is a love story, of a Prince Charming who rescues his love from death, only to be cursed with never being able to take her in his (bare) arms.

Worst.  Cancellation.  Ever.  The ratings were down a bit, but PUSHING DAISIES was one of the most critically acclaimed shows on television and completely on top of its artistic game.  The plot was thickening and the best was clearly yet to come.  But ABC, instead of showing a bit of courage, chickened out and cancelled what was easily their best series (only LOST came close).  The decision remains mind-boggling.  If you haven't seen DAISIES, do so and you'll be as baffled as the show's many fans.

Whenever I sat down to watch PUSHING DAISIES and the opening image would come up, with a rising orchestra backing a flower coming back to life after being magically touched, I would chock up a bit.  I don't know that there has ever been a show that has made me so purely happy as PUSHING DAISIES.  Almost, in fact, a bit ecstatic.  It brought poetry, magic, and beauty to the small screen in ways that we'd never seen before.

When Bryan Fuller realized that there was a good chance that PUSHING DAISIES was going to be cancelled in midseason, he shot two sets of scenes.  Edited one way it would have served as a midseason transition to the second half; edited another it provided a bit more closure than otherwise.  As a result, the series will end with less of a cliffhanger than originally conceived.

Does PUSHING DAISIES have a future?  As a television series, no.  But Bryan Fuller has announced plans to follow in the footsteps of Joss Whedon, who did a canonical continuation of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER by producing BUFFY Season 8.  Pending permission by Warner Brothers, Fuller has stated his hopes of continuing PUSHING DAISIES as a comic book on Marvel Comics (where, he says, Ned can perhaps touch Captain America).  His goal, he says, is to complete Chuck and Ned's story.  The series leaves their story unresolved and he feels that that is not fair to the show's fans.  I can't express strongly enough how much I appreciate Bryan Fuller's commitment to letting everyone know how this story is supposed to end.

If you love TV, you need to watch this series.  This is not your average TV series.  It isn't your average exceptionally good TV series.  When I say that this show is unmatched in the history of TV for sheer physical beauty, I am completely series.  The series will make you smile, laugh, cry, and mourn.  And you'll join me is insisting that it is THE most stupid cancellation in the history of television.",1240272000,184,9013,4.690248565965583

3846689,5,B0024FABCG,"This is one of the most enjoyable tv series I've watched this year.  I don't recall what was happening in my life when this was on tv, but I missed that movement.  Now, that I've watched both seasons, I'm disappointed the show was cancelled before the writers/producers could bring its plot to a satisfactory end.

Ned the piemaker had a rough childhood and has a special gift he didn't ask for.  He can bring the dead back to life with one touch.  If he touches them again, they are dead forever.  If he does not make them dead again within one minute, something else will die in its place.  To make his world a better place, he brings his childhood sweetheart and neighbor, Charlotte ""Chuck"" Charles back to life.  It is sweet to watch how they fall in love and show that love without physical intimacy.  Ned uses his gift to help a local detective Emerson Cod solve cases.  Their adventures are quirky and original.  The costumes and scenery in this series are quite lovely.  Someone should write a book to bring this series to a close since it doesn't appear the show will be revived.",1483315200,4,1088,4.494897959183674

3846691,2,B0024FABCG,"I purchased the blu ray version.  The show is great, but the season 1 disc came in a case labeled ""The Pie Hole"", rather than Pushing Daisies, which I thought was odd.  Upon watching Season 1 I found that I couldn't watch it by episode.  There were three discs and each disc contained one long video with three episodes in each video.  I'm a fan of Pushing Daisies, but I would have preferred to have been able to select the episode I wanted to watch rather than having to scroll through the chapter list for the merged video to find the episode I was looking for. Even then it was hit or miss.  The Season 2 disc was fine.  I could choose to watch an episode if I wanted to and the case was labeled Pushing Daisies.",1480291200,2,716,4.189781021897811

3846700,4,B0024FABCG,"Bryan Fuller can almost be called the King of Critically acclaimed show that gained great cult followings (Wonderfalls and Hannibal are two others) but never gain widespread support.

Pushing Daisies tells the story of a pie maker named Ned (Lee Pace) who can bring the living back from the dead with two caveats:

1.  If the dead thing remains alive for more than a minute then something else of approximate age and/or size must die.
2.  If he touches the dead person/animal/plant etc a second time, it remains dead forever.

He ends up forming a partnership with a private eye named Emerson Cod (played by Chi McBride), using his gift to bring murder victims back from the dead for a minute, asking them who killed them, and collecting the reward money.

Most likely anyone reading this review by now, given the show has been off the air for the better part of a decade will have seen all the episodes, and knows what happened, but for those who have not I will not spoil it.  Sufficed to say, the show looks great on blu ray.  The visuals (mostly special effects) made the show, with all its quirkiness (which it embraced) almost a spectacle.  The only down side to the show was that it was cut very short.  Cancelled basically halfway through the second season, so there were things that basically had to be dropped, like story lines involving Chuck's (Ned's childhood sweetheart played by Anna Friel) and Ned's respective fathers.  The show was able to wrap up the series with a very incomplete feel, and did what it could, but not everything was tied up in nice little bows.

As for extras, it is fairly light.  This set is just seasons 1 and 2 packaged together.  The box for season 1's set says there should be a featurette with the cast talking about their favorite moments which was not on any of the three discs in my set.  That is why I knocked the set down a star.  In season 2, there are extras on the 2nd disc, which are basically behind the scenes and making of features.  Okay for what is there, but not extensive.  Mostly you will get this either because you are a fan of Bryan Fuller's other shows, or watched it when it was originally on the air.  If you just happen to stumble across it, it is a very well written and acted show, but just know that because it was ended in the way it was, it will come off as being very incomplete and ending abruptly.",1460246400,6,2372,4.436489607390301

Additionally, if he touches the revived person or thing a second time, it dies again, this time permanently.

The untouchable love between Ned and Chuck was emotional. Private investigator Emerson Cod kept a variety of unsolved mysteries as a vehicle for Ned to discover the reason for their murders. Using a narrator to link scenes was a nice touch.

3846746,5,B0024FABCG,"If you like the way Jim Dale reads books, or story based things like Cat N the Hat, you will love this. I mean the live action. It has the tone of Cat N The Hat and so on.

What I think makes this show fantastic is the fact that Jim Dale narrates through the entire show. Stating the obvious but making it stale. What peeks people's interest is the way the show was presented. So far this is the only show I've seen of it's kind. Some people try to say Wonderfalls is in this category but I beg to differ. Unfortunately, like most misunderstood shows as of Mission Hill and The Flash series, this show had also been canceled. I think what happens to good shows is that people try to hard to understand it and don't let the show flow and be on it's own.

If you have never watched this show before and are look at reviews let me explain the idea:

In a town called Coeur d'Coeurs (K-uh-Deh-K-uh), where Ned grew up, he did not know the power in which he had. After his golden retriever is hit by a truck, he touches him and brings him back to life not knowing the consequences of what will happen. In order for something to live, something else must die with in 1 minute. After his mother has an aneurism, he brings her back to life, but only to take the life of his best friend's father. She, never knew. As he grew older, he became the Pie-maker. One day as he's throwing out trash, a man falls from a rooftop, dead. Later telling the detective running after the man about his powers, he made a deal with him to make extra money and to make it worth while.

3846748,5,B0024FABCG,"I was so excited to get my series set of seasons 1-2, because on the night ABC pushed out the last three episodes all in one night, wouldn't you know it, there was a thunderstorm and my power went out!  I never got to see the last three episodes, until now!  Truly the greatest series I have ever seen on television.  The show was a fun mishmash of Amelie, the Scooby-Doo Mysteries, and just a splash of Tinker-Bell Disney magic.

The ONLY bad thing about this series was it's unceremonious cancellation by ABC that did not allow it's creators to make an adequate ending.  The characters story endings were all squished into less than a minute at the very end.  It's unfathomable to me that ABC would cancel such an incredible program, how many reviewers can be wrong on this?!  I have boycotted ABC ever since.",1401321600,,811,4.513698630136986

3846751,5,B0024FABCG,"In the special features someone commented that Pushing Daisies was meant to be like a storybook. That is what makes it so unique and fun to watch. The dialogue is more formal than real life, the colors and designs more artistic and bright. Even the morgue is pretty and bright. And even though the world is bright it fits well with the storybook style in which the story is presented.

The storybook style also means that people can die in over the top ways that make death a little.... funny. It's got lots of silliness that I love and moments that are touching too. It's a shame that it only got two seasons but it doesn't leave you feeling completely dissatisfied because it wraps up relatively well on the last episode.",1397001600,,723,4.519083969465649

Presented almost like an ongoing fairytale through the background narration, Pushing Daisies follows Ned who has the curious ability to revive the dead with his touch.  There are cosmic consequences to this though.  I won't destroy the plot line for you, but you easily imagine the potential comic results.  Great acting and hilarious portrayals by the cast and excellent scripts make this show one to watch over and over.",1391212800,,482,4.771084337349397

3846765,5,B0024FABCG,"Pushing Daisies is another show where I watched the pilot when it aired, but never followed the show after that.  I blame my own mental state at the time and not wanting to watch something so silly and light and over-the-top.  The colors are bright, the dialogue tends toward things that, if said in the real world in the presence of a cynic (which I really, really was at the time), would make them go ""UGH!""  But if you're in the mood for emotional goodness and dramatic tension that will make even the happiest situation bittersweet, but still good, give the show a try.

Also, if you've ever watched Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, two previous Fuller shows, keep watch out for the nods to those shows as well!  It makes me feel like the shows truly exist in the same universe, and makes me dream of an unwritten team-up between the casts of all three shows.",1372982400,2,860,4.452229299363057

3846770,5,B0024FABCG,"This is by far one of my favorite TV series of all time. It is most definitely unique, about Ned, the main character, who can bring people back to life with his touch. He and a sarcastic private detective in love with money (played phenomenally by Chi McBride) turn this gift into a profit making business by asking people who killed them and collecting the reward money. Naturally there are many conflicts with such a gift, which only adds to the series. This series is very great, both humorous and addicting; my only regret was that it was canceled after the second season.",1369872000,,576,4.601941747572815

I watched the first episode and was instantly addicted! I wish I had a chance to become a fan while it aired but rather late than never. Everything about this show was excellent; the cast, the narrative, the sets,the direction, the story-lines, everything! I hate that I will never know how it could have ended; what could have become of Chuck and the Pie Maker...

Pushing Daisies is one of those rare shows that blends so many creative elements; the writing and dialogue delivery by the actors. It has wonderful visual stimulants with the way it is filmed, the color and wardrobe not to mention a very interesting and for me, a unique plot. For instance, I usually hate voice over narratives but not on this show. I was soothed by the narrator's commentary. I became a huge Lee Pace fan after watching the series, going on to view his other works. He is Really talented.

If you haven't seen the show, definitely give it a try. You'll find yourself most pleasantly surprised!",1352505600,,1249,4.542222222222223

The setting seems to be sometime in the late 50's or early 60's in a small town in the northwest.  The premise involving Ned's magic finger which can bring dead things (people, animals, etc.) back to life briefly, is peculiar and fascinating, and the characters are all well-acted, funny, and one-of-a-kind.  Guess that's why it didn't succeed.  Kudos to the creator and writers for not following the same tired old formulas!",1345075200,,627,5.058252427184466

This series is a riot and so well acted.  I think the only thing that would make it better is if Ellen would sing more often, that woman has an incredible voice and I wanted her to belt out a song...but it's okay.  The premise was nutsy, but it's so well written and so well produced you just don't care.  What a great series.

I was really sad when it was cancelled, but I ordered this product and now I get to experience the magic of this show with increased appreciation through adult eyes. When I was a kid I somehow failed to fully appreciate the gorgeous cinematography, witty banter between characters, excellent casting choices, and the spectacular romance between the main characters. This full series set arrived promptly and in perfect condition, everything was sealed and the discs are in great condition. Watching the show this time around is even more thrilling because I get to share it with my mother and two younger sisters who missed it when it was still airing. I recently read that the creator of the show is hoping that a network like Starz or Showtime will pick up Pushing Daisies for a mini-series, and if this happens I will be tuning in regularly. In short: order this series because you will love the show and you will share in the frustration of us fans who still mourn it.",1326931200,,1123,4.564356435643564

Everything is so bright and colorful and the attention to detail is absolutely amazing!  From the character matching clothing, to the coordinating wallpaper and bedding, to the use of old and new style cars that makes it impossible to tell what date it is.  I find something new everytime I watch it.

A story-book feel with a scooby-doo-like mystery to solve, the show is as clever as it is funny.  With well written characters and dialogue, the use of the narrator is a nicely added touch.

Its no reality tv show, or drama series, or family sitcom but that is why it stands out on its own as possibly the best show ever to be on television (especially nowadays)  I only wish some other network would be smart enough to put it back on.",1288051200,,845,4.586666666666667

3846801,5,B0024FABCG,"I started watching Pushing Daisies about halfway through the first season. Needless to say, I was hooked! When the first season was cut short because of the writer's strike, I was sad, but then happy when they picked it up again with season 2. I don't know why ABC decided to cancel the show, since it seems to have such a TREMENDOUS following, but that's neither here nor there at this point.

Moving onto the DVD's themselves, the price alone makes the purchase worth it. You're getting both seasons (which, episode-wise makes up about one season's-worth of a show), with all of the bells & whistles that came with the originals. As far as the special features themselves, they're a little sparse, but given the show's short run that's to be expected.

All in all, I recommend this to ANYONE who likes TV. The show's funny, the dialogue is fast-paced and witty, and the acting is fantastic!",1265760000,,892,4.67515923566879

3846807,5,B0024FABCG,"I've done a lot of thinking about ""Pushing Daisies,"" and I've come to the conclusion that it IS the best television series I've EVER watched.  Without qualification.  Without doubt.  I can't even begin to describe how good this series is.  If I had to choose one word to describe it, ""refreshing"" would have to be it.  The simple beauty of the environment, the personalities, the relationships, the dialog..., heck, even the costumes, sound track, and colors, are just plain refreshing.  When I compare it to the unwatchable dreck that is every other show out there that these networks keep pumping out by the gross, I just sit there agog for a while and then, umm, start saying bad things about the network execs who canceled it.

Regarding the physical media, it's fine.  I had my usual problems removing the DVDs from their mountings.  But, other than that, the audio and video quality was excellent.

So, make sure you compare the price of this ""omnibus"" version to that of the sum of the two individual seasons since the combination packaging doesn't get you anything more and doesn't necessarily cost less than the separate packages.  I'll also add that I don't normally watch the extras provided on these DVDs.  In this case, since I loved the series so much, I did watch them (four short sessions on the making of the series).  They actually add a bit to the series and I enjoyed them.

In general, there aren't enough stars available in the universe to properly rate this series.  So, sticking with the highest rating available, I give it a Wonderful 5 stars out of 5 and darn all ABC executives to H E double-toothpicks for all eternity for canceling it.",1263600000,6,2415,6.2507552870090635
3846808,5,B0024FABCG,"This show was hilarious and cute, reminds me of a Dr Seuss story because of the narrator.
I don't know why they canceled it. I guess not enough people didn't watch it. I myself don't have time to watch much TV, but my friend likes this show and bought the first season on DVD(she's watching for the second one in the mail now) and asked me to watch it with her. I'm glad I did! Chi McBride is so Funny in this show.
I'm still watching the first season, but I plan on buying both seasons later in the year.",1262649600,,505,4.06
3846809,5,B0024FABCG,I love the show and at Amazon I got it at such a wonderful price.  Also with free shipping.,1261785600,,91,3.789473684210526
3846810,5,B0024FABCG,I must say that very few shows have caught my interest and made me a fan. This is one of the few. I loved this show which made me laugh none stop. I loved the quirkly fairy tale that it captured on each episode.  What is wrong with the networks to get rid of shows like this that are actually worth watching?,1258416000,,308,3.967741935483871
3846811,5,B0024FABCG,Pushing Daisies is a fantastic show full of comedy and wonder. Definitely one of my top 5 shows of all time. It is a true shame it got canceled. Do your self a favor and get this product right away,1252713600,,197,3.95
3846812,5,B0024FABCG,"This quirky and endearing series was a sad victim of the writer's strike.  The cast is appealing, the plots are unusual.  Please release the last shows so we can enjoy the story end to end.",1251763200,4,189,4.371428571428571
3846813,5,B0024FABCG,The first set of discs actually arrived broken. Part of the plastic of both DVD cases had shattered. A quick email and I had replacements on the way with instructions on how to send the broken ones back. The show itself is wonderfully offbeat and fun. Overall I'm glad I bought the set to have both seasons.,1251676800,,307,4.4035087719298245
3846814,5,B0024FABCG,"This tv series was my favorite when it aired, I was so sad when they cancelled it!  The show is very over-the-top and quirky.  In each episode there are a lot of twists and turns and you never know quite what's going to happen.  Each time you watch an episode there is something new that you notice that you hadn't before.  The show has a lot of witty banter and is very fast-paced.  A must see!",1251417600,2,395,4.144736842105263
3846815,5,B0024FABCG,"Pushing Daisies was the best new show of 2007 until the ill-timed writers' strike ended the first season at 9 episodes.  Date and time changes aside, after an interminable hiatus the second season returned only to be cancelled by the network, as the writers heroically attempted to tie up loose ends.  Kudos to Bryan Fuller, Barry Sonnenfeld and the entire creative staff for bringing us the most wondrous, unique and quirky fairy tale ever shown on network TV.",1250985600,2,461,4.897435897435898
3846816,5,B0024FABCG,"This was my *feel good* show. I could be in the worst mood or have had the most horrible day, but the moment I heard Jim Dale's narration start, I felt better.
Ned and Chuck had the most beautiful, innocent love. I melted when they looked into each others eyes.
Chi Mcbride was just wonderful as Emerson Cod.
I still cannot believe that this show was canceled.
Luckily I was able to purchase the first two seasons here ~ but I want MORE!!!",1248566400,17,439,4.301204819277109

I purchased this hoping for a ""boxed"" set, possibly bonus materials.
Since this set is an additional $4.51,
the best value is to purchase Season 1 and Season 2 separately.",1248480000,53,396,8.658536585365853

8350626,5,B0024FABCG,"Excited that I could find this. Watched a few episodes as a kid and loved it, but could never recall the name. When I finally found it again it came as a surprise that it only lasted couple seasons, so clearly I was excited to find a complete set. It came packaged okay, my only problem was that it was in an envelope and my postal delivery service shoved it into my itty bitty 6 inch x 7 inch mailbox, but that's their bad. Super pleased with this.",1490832000,,449,4.113636363636363
