8448862,5,B004YUHBJ0,I loved the Live Action Movie and felt that it was really well cast and did a great job of incorporating a lot of scenes from the series. The anime is really fun to watch and is fairly true to the manga. The cd that is included is also fun to listen to.,1376006400,,253,3.792452830188679
