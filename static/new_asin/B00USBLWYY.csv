7070829,5,B00USBLWYY,"Classic Quotes - Mitch ... Hello...? Hi Curly. Killed anyone today? Curley - The day ain't over yet...  Jack Palance, Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern & Bruno Kelly star in this classic movie,  It's Jack Palance's Best Supporting Actor Oscar role!  The story line is wonderful, and it has great casting!  If you enjoy a movie that  keeps you interested from the beginning to the end, this is for you. A great story about finding out what is important in your life and what means the most to you plus some laughs and great quotes along the way.  Yes there is foul language, but its hard to find films without it these days.. It's about three adventurous middle age friends who go on a cattle drive in celebration of Mitch's (Billy Crystal) birthday and discover more about what  men they really are and want to be in life.
Don't miss out on the mini movie of Norman in the DVD!!!  Its great!",1522281600,,885,4.453416149068323

7070859,4,B00USBLWYY,"Overall, this has a pretty interesting plot. Just like it's sequel, the only thing I didn't like about it was how crass it was. During the first half to two thirds of it, I almost want to turn it off on a count of how coarse even beyond my crude senses of humor it gets. At least the last half to third of it is what got much cleaner and therefore got way more entertaining. It would have made a great cowboy and adventure comedy even with heartwarming moments that it had if only had it not been marred with so much bad language and sex talk and especially most of what Bruno Kirby's character did, including some references to adultery and the straight kind of indecent sight of, for one, seeing a calf get born, and two, a buttcrack scene of an unrefined class speaker. If this all would have been left out, it would have made a pretty funny and heartwarming story.",1485993600,,868,4.298780487804878

7070863,4,B00USBLWYY,"Released in 1991 and directed by Ron Underwood, City Slickers is a Western dramedy taking place in modern times (1991, that is) starring Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern as three buddies from the New York City area who are experiencing mid-life problems and decide to take a two week vacation driving cattle from New Mexico to Colorado to find their mojo. Jack Palance plays the tough leader of the cattle drive while Patricia Wettig plays one of the wives. Helen Slater and others are along for the ride.

This was a hit at the time but, seeing today, it was a little overrated. Still, its a solid dramedy mixing amusing moments with somewhat poignant insights on life. While Im familiar with Crystal, this is the only movie Ive seen him in and he plays a quality everyman. Wettig is striking and Slater is winsome, but the latter is prematurely removed from the main events.

The film runs 113 minutes and was shot mostly in New Mexico, but also Colorado, New York City and Universal City, CA.

7070865,5,B00USBLWYY,"I love this movie - the humor, the story line.  A good movie without the sex; although there are a fair share of sexually explicit and suggestive lines. It's about three adventurous New Yorker friends who go on a cattle drive in celebration of Mitch's (Billy Crystal) bday and discover more about what kind of men they really are and want to be.  It's quite old, so finding it was not easy; I've been looking for 3 years. Not only did this seller have it to purchase, it was at a great price.",1481328000,,492,4.279569892473118
