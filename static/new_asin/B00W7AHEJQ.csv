8712414,5,B00W7AHEJQ,"This is a super cute DVD.  My boys love the Scholastic collections. On this DVD you have four fun shows.  The favorites of my boys are, ""I Want My Hat Back"" and ""The Happy Lion"".  We had somehow missed ever reading the book ""I Want My Hat Back"" but after watching the dvd, we then purchased the book.

I Want My Hat Back: Bears hat is gone. None of the animals have seen it, but Bears memory is sparked by a deer who asks just the right question.

The Lucky Ducklings: A true story about a mama duck and her five ducklings that had to be rescued from a town storm drain during an early morning walk.

The Happy Lion: A lion in a Paris zoo tries to return his friends visits by venturing into town to see them.

The Happy Owls: Two owls discover the secret of peace and happiness and share their secret with all their barnyard friends.

**I was sent this dvd for free to preview and  to give my honest opinion",1435536000,3,908,4.142857142857143
