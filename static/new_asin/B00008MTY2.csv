1852972,5,B00008MTY2,"This movie is excellent clean entertainment.  They don't make movies like this anymore, and especially with train animals.  Jay North is wonderful like he was in Dennis the Menace.",1390867200,2,180,5.172413793103448
1852973,5,B00008MTY2,"Here's what I'd been looking for, an easy going family oriented comedy that I wouldn't hesitate to show to my nephew.  Plenty of weirdness and monkeyshine to laugh at and you won't have to cover anybody's eyes or send the kids out of the room for cupcakes during any particular scene.  The humor is mostly slapstick sight gags and the soundtrack music is catchy. No references to sex, drugs or excessive violence.  Some crooked politicians are part of the plot, but that's non biased as its left up to the viewer to decide whether they're Republicans, Democrats or any of the sort that barely gets any votes come election day.

The DVD includes the original trailer that aired on television, but watch that after the movie because it contains a few plot spoilers.",1379030400,4,763,4.714285714285714
1852974,5,B00008MTY2,"A great family movie from the Dennis the Menace child star.  I saw this at the theater when I was a kid and begged my parents for a zebra  Much to my disappointment, I got neither.  They would have been right at home with the goat in the back yard or the skunk we had as pets.",1373155200,,276,3.807017543859649

1852976,5,B00008MTY2,"Now, I don't care what you say, this movie is a good family movie. It's full of funny and entertaining scenes and great actors. This movie is sure to delight those of all ages.

If you want my addvice, buy this DVD. It is worth the price and you'll get your entertainment value out of it for sure. So, what are you waiting for?! Buy this DVD now! This is what kids need to watch instead of violent garbage!",1228262400,11,406,4.139240506329114
1852977,3,B00008MTY2,"I remember watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it.  Adults, on the other hand, might find the plot to be a bit boring and far-fetched.  Even though Jay North (Dennis the Menace) does an admirable acting job, there is no way a boy his age would let out all the animals in the zoo without thinking of the potentially dire consequences -- not only to the public but to the animals themselves.  Still, it was slightly ahead of its time in increasing public awareness on some of the less-than-desirable conditions of some animals in captivity.  All that being said, it's still a fun movie -- at least for the kiddie set.",1178064000,6,628,4.482456140350878
1852978,4,B00008MTY2,"This is the original classic tale of the boy who let all the animals out of the zoo, directed by Ivan Tors, the best animal filmmaker of the 1960s (Flipper, Gentle Ben, Sea Hunt, Daktari, etc.). The idea was later used in 12 Monkeys.
Jay North (Maya) is the boy, whose own pet mountain lion is confined to the delapidated city zoo, so he lets it out along with all the other animals.  Zookeepers Martin Milner (Adam 12, Life With Father, 13 Ghosts) and Andy Devine (Island In The Sky, That's The Spirit) have to help round them up.  There are some cameos including Marshall Thompson (Daktari).
Recommended for kids to see animals & slapstick humor.",1159056000,9,648,4.577586206896552
1852979,3,B00008MTY2,"It has been some time since I last saw this movie. I had had it on one of my video tapes but when I got around to dubbing their contents onto DVDs this movie was missing. I am glad to see it is on DVD so I can purchase it again later. I enjoy animal movies, and wanted to see Jay North in action years after he was Dennis the Menace. I also like Martin Milner whom I'd seen in Adam-12 and Valley of the Dolls. I can always understand what he is saying, and appreciate how he conveys emotions in his delivery. While I did think Sunshine a dumb name for a cougar, I could understand how the boy didn't want to leave him behind when his family had to move. So many escapades in this movie, and a very supportive zookeeper played by Andy Devine. I cannot remember the name of Sunshine's owner, but in the course of the movie he learns a little on how to behave responsibly rather than impulsively, and winds up with a deeper appreciation of how to make a difference in the lives of zoo animals.",1123372800,3,990,4.134715025906735

7985513,1,B00008MTY2,"This was for my 8 yr old sister's birthday, but I returned it. First of all, for my family, there was questionable content - in a Laurel/Hardy scene there was a woman wearing little better than a bikini top and a long loin cloth with cuts and slits in it and then there was a naked man in a tub (his one end stayed out of camera view - barely). Then, the story line (if you could call it that) was very boring (lacking) - about a boy who brings his cougar to the city after being told to leave it behind, ends up having to put it in a zoo, and then decides to let all of the animals out of the zoo (I agree the cages weren't in the best condition), despite the potential harm for not only the animals, but the people living in the city - that was about all that happened. It was a lot of footage with no story. We didn't even enjoy seeing the animals - the bear on the bicycle was fake. The acting - other than Andy Devine's - wasn't that great either. It was a disappointment because Ivan Tor's Flipper had been so good.",1507161600,,1021,4.009803921568627
