one of the best Giant spider movies of all! (second only to Tarantula)A young high school girl, her boyfriend and a town of oridinary joe's battle a super-sized spider. the special effects are dazzeling for its time. the only dorky think is the spider's shrieking :).
all the spider flicks coming out in out anticipation of the theatrical movie Eight-legged Freaks! have paled in comarision to this one.

Besides, if you have WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST, you already have the best of THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN. You see, WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST is told largely in flashbacks utilizing the best SFX sequences from THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN.

So then, why else is it paired with EARTH vs. THE SPIDER? In EARTH VS. THE SPIDER, the juvenile lead's father owns the local movie house in which is NOW PLAYING... THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN.

SPOILER ALERT

What's new is the last few feet of footage which were new to the sequel. The Colossal Man corners some high school kids on a planetarium outing and lifts their tour bus high into the air. When he is electrocuted by a high tension power cable, The movie turns into color.

There was a familiar feeling to all these old AIP movies anyway. The casts seemed to rotate from one movie to another... John Agar, June Kenney, Sally Forest, etc.

441106,3,6302136296,"Putting any nostalgia aside for a moment and just being honest, both of these films are sub-par even when considered within their own low-budget (B-movie) genre.

EARTH VS. THE SPIDER is vastly inferior to Universal's TARANTULA, with characters who are stiff and remote. The intended scary moments are too forced, and the picture doesn't hold any tension at all. There are several cool shots of the giant spider rampaging through town, and the theatre scene (with contemporary lobby cards posted on the wall) was a treat. Overall this picture isn't very convincing as the actors merely give the impression that they're simply going through the motions. With such a tepid script and meager budget, it's easy to understand why. Rating 2.5/5.

WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST is a direct sequel (with too generous flashbacks, including the origin scene) to THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, which was a good science-fiction film. Unfortunately this follow-up picture gives us nothing that comes close to being memorable. Even when attempting to copy some of the prior drama, this film flops on most levels (no one here is going to be mistaken for Sherlock Holmes). The passing-the-buck bureaucrat scene (where nobody wanted the giant) was almost funny, as was the final act shot in color(?). Sally Fraser (as the beast's sister, Joyce) is probably the highlight of this film, which is not really saying much. Rating 2.5/5.

Both films serve up too many illogical and weak sequences that fail to engage. Attempts to capture the ending tension of THEM! are wasted here. In conclusion worth a single viewing yes, but not much more than that. Overall I'll be generous (budget pricing helps here), 3/5.",1365206400,,1680,5.0359712230215825

441111,5,6302136296,"A giant spider on a rampage, where have I heard that one before?
Obviously, I couldn't pass this up, even though I wish they had put The Amazing Colossal Man with War of the Colossal Beast instead of Earth VS the Spider.  But, better a sequel than nothing!

My favorite of the two films presented in this set is the one about the giant spider.  It's a spider and it's huge, I'm happy.  The story isn't new: a giant spider gets hungry, leaves its cozy cave, gets caught, presumed dead, goes on a rampage.  The dialog is hopelessly inane, the characters are mostly idiots written into doing stupid things.  My favorite scene is when they decide to douse the poor spider with DDT, requiring the longest hose in the world (dragged from a tanker parked on a road, down another dirt road, and well into a cave)!  Why they didn't park closer is anyone's guess.  They're just lucky they happen to carry a mile long hose.
Most shocking scene, the wanton killing of a poor defenseless bat, just to make a point.  Another amusing scene has to do with an inordinate number of skeletons that everyone, including the sheriff, keeps passing by, no thought to removing them, as if they were part of a Disney ride!  Seriously, someone needed to bag those bones for posterity if nothing else.  They're probably still in that cave.  I'm losing sleep worrying about them.  I know that town was small but surely it had a coroner.

As for the second feature, big man on the run from an overly possessive sister.  It has its moments; such as when they finally find a giant footprint and surmise that it must have been made by a 60-foot man, ""think it could be him?""  How many 60-foot men did they think were on the loose?

They really don't make movies like this anymore.  I wonder why?",1360540800,,1763,4.4733542319749215
441132,5,6302136296,"To me, the best of the two is the Colossal Beast.  I had seen this one many years ago, and had forgotten about it.  Now I have it, and am glad for it.",1359072000,,150,3.515151515151515
441133,1,6302136296,"EARTH VS. THE SPIDER and WAR OF THE COLOSSAL BEAST have a lot in common.  Both were produced by API, both had the same basic creative team, both were released in 1958, and both are really, really bad movies.

EARTH VS. THE SPIDER is just barely watchable.  Carol's father has gone out of town and not returned.  She pesters her boyfriend Mike into helping her look for him, and by chance they find her father's wrecked car near a mysterious cave.  Quite naturally they take a peek, and they discover a gigantic, web-spinning, man-eating tarantuala.  Local authorities dose it up with DDT, but while it is in storage the beat of a local rock band awakens the spider, which was only stunned.  The spider then runs wild through the town courtesy of minature sets, bad rear-view projection, and paper cut-outs.

If that sounds tiresome, I can honestly say that it is better than WAR OF THE COLASSAL BEAST, which actually put me to sleep.  In theory a sequel to THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN, this one is about military man Col. Manning, who got caught in an atomic blast and proceeded to grow to a height of sixty feet.  Everyone thought he was dead, but now he's found hiding out in the Mexican mountains.  American authorties dose him up with sleeping gas, but after he's transported back to the United States he breaks free.  The colossal beast then runs wild through the city courtesy of minature props and double exposures.

Now and then you come across a bad movie that's fun to watch, with Ed Wood movies cases in point.  But most bad movies are just bad and that's all there is you can say about them.  If you're a hard core fan of bad 1950s ""B"" movies, by all means have fun.  But most people will glaze over in less than ten minutes.

Now to see it again on DVD brought back many memories. The movie is not so scary now, I am 65, but it is just as much fun. For big bug movies from the 1950's this was not badly done at all.  I have never seen the ""War of the Colossal Beast."" Maybe it would have helped to have seen the first movie since this was a sequel. Just for me the movie left me a little cold. I would not say it was bad, just not a lot to it. The four stars are from the first movie. I would give the second three.

The picture and sound quality are great, and ""The Spider"" is definitely one of the most enjoyable of the 50's sci-fi big bug blasts!

Yeah, gotta love the spider's scream of doom! Lots of familiar and enjoyable cast members...some of which are seen in ""Giant From The Unknown"", filmed at nearly the same moment!

Look for the somewhat varying scale of the spider's size from scene to scene! If he really is as big as the street scenes would suggest, could he really fit so easily in the auditorium? How'd they get him in? Retractable roof? Just one facet of fun for this flick! Also, look for in-story promotion of related sci-fi releases of the time! Highly Recommended!

441162,4,6302136296,"I recently purchased this sci-fi double feature from amazon, and am quite pleased with it.  My only real dissapointment with it is that it contained no special features (or ""goodies"" as I like to call them).  Just the 2 movies and that's it!  It would be nice, of course, to have at least a short documentary about the films and the original trailers, like they do with other DVDs.  (Hard to believe they didn't include trailers!)  This is the only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars and not 5.  Other than that, no complaints.  I'm especially glad about having the first film, ""Earth VS. The Spider"", on DVD.  I recorded it many years ago from television onto a VHS tape and, needless to say, the quality was none too good.  With this DVD I now have a crystal-clear print of perfect quality!  (Even the sound is rich and clear!)  What a pleasure it was to finally see the movie this way!  The second film, ""War Of The Colossal Beast"", is also presented in perfect clarity.  I have never seen it before, although I had heard about it.  (It's the sequel to ""The Amazing Colossal Man"").  A nice feature of this DVD is that both movies are on one side of the disc. No having to flip it over to see the second film!  The films themselves are typical 1950's sci-fi fare, with the usual low-budget special FX.  It's kind of hard to believe that in the 50's, when these films were made, audiences were actually frightened by them!  Now-a-days, they're just fun entertainment, so if that's what you're looking for, then this one's for you!  All in all, a very well made, high quality double feature, that I highly recommend for all lovers of 1950's sci-fi!!",1285113600,4,1645,4.478114478114478
441163,3,6302136296,"Despite a thin plot, and quaint special effects, Earth vs. The Spider (1958) is a pretty entertaining and fun B movie, highlighted by a giant spider running amok in a small town.  Although primitive by today's standards, the special effects are effective enough, as a giant tarantula wreaks havoc, attacking homes, and terrorizing the populace.

After a teenage couple report seeing a giant spider in a cave, the authorities investigate, and discover the body of the girl's father, encased in webbing, and drained dry of fluids.  They locate and apparently kill, a huge spider, and then store the inert body of the gigantic hairy arachnid, in a school gym for future study.  When some kids begin practicing their music, the supposedly dead spider comes to life, and takes a terrifying and destructive romp through the town, on the way back to its cave.  The slowly moving spider, appears mostly superimposed over background shots, ambling along, screeching noisily.  Much of the violence attributed to the spider, takes place offscreen.

Meanwhile the same teenage couple has returned to the cave, and find themselves trapped inside with the spider, when the cave entrance is sealed closed by the authorities.  A rescue team manages to make an unlikely reentry into the cave.  The scenes in the remarkably well-lighted cave, are mildly suspenseful, although the spider's activities are rather limited, and the spider web that looks like a rope net, is hardly convincing.

When it comes to special effects, a little seems to go a long way, and they are just good enough to hold the story together.  Being shot in black and white, probably helps to smooth over some of the technical issues that occur in featuring the giant spider.  The people behave mostly rationally, and the acting is passable, in this mostly entertaining, mildly scary, 73 minute creature feature, directed by Bert Ira Gordon.  Gordon, built his career on B-move horror and fantasy films, like The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), Village of the Giants (1965), Empire of the Ants (1977), and The Mad Bomber (1973).",1264809600,2,2079,5.043859649122807
441164,5,6302136296,"Bert I. Gordon's Earth Vs. The Spider (1958 - 73m) is a thoroughly enjoyable trip back into 50's era movie monsterdom. If you are a fan of these ""there goes the neighborhood"" films of its day, you must add this one to your early sci fi collection. A successful attempt at deciding not to use stop action animation, Gordon's idea of suspense and small town panic work well as a pretty great looking over sized furry eight legged demon terrorizes small town USA. Be prepared for a few laughs too but this one should not be seen without an industrial sized can of DECON. Have fun with this one!",1256342400,,591,4.431192660550459
441165,5,6302136296,"Folks may scratch their heads when I say this, but Bert I. Gordon is one of my all time favorite movie directors.  He is for the simple fact that I have found them all(the ""big"" ones specifically) thoroughly entertaining, which I assume is what most directors could ever hope for.  Gordon's reputation is no more than that of a low budget trash peddler, and his place in cinema history will probably be no more than a mere footnote in the world of Sci-Fi.  I feel he's more deserving than that.  After all, if Ed Wood can achieve the status he has, why can't Gordon(I find Gordon's films to be consistently more entertaining and fun than Wood's)?
Anyhow, the first on the Gordon double bill is Earth Vs. The Spider.  A much more accurate title would have been Handful Of People Vs. The Spider, but that's not as punchy or threatening.  In the movie, a pair of high school students(sweethearts of course) find a giant spider(Giant Spider! Whoa! Giant Spider! Whoa!) in a cave outside of their small town.  The local authorities blast it with DDT and believe it to be dead.  It's taken to the local high school auditorium and put on display until it can be picked up by scientists.  When the band slated to play the high school dance start rehearsing their blasted rock and roll music, the spider wakes up and is pretty pissed(no accounting for taste I suppose.  I thought they were kinda catchy).  The spider rampages through town and finds his way home where the final showdown takes place.
The best of the two films for sure.  It's alot of fun with everything you could want from a film like this.  It's got rock and roll, high school kids, creepy theremin theme music, shriveled corpses, and of course a giant spider.  My rule of rating is that any film will get one extra star if it features a giant spider(hence the 5 star rating).  Gordon's visual fx are the same as he's always used, and that consists of a real spider spliced into the frame with the actors and settings.  Gordon's fx are always slammed and considered laughable, but I always though he was above average for this kind of film.  You can tell it's fake, but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  In fact there's something strangely realistic about it.  After all we are dealing with a real spider and not a puppet.  You can't help but imagine that that is how it would really look if a giant spider were to invade your hometown.  Very cool movie.
Next we have War of the Colossal Beast.  It's a sequel to the Amazing Colossal Man, but you won't be lost in the plot considering they use footage from that film and reference it enough to bring you up to date.  Glen, The Colossal Man, has survived the attack he received at the end of the first film and has turned up in Mexico.  Glen is a 60 foot man mutated by atomic radiation.  He must have an enormous schwanzstucker, but I guess that goes without saying.  He's been stealing food, terroizing the people and just making everything unpleasant.  The U.S. army comes, captures him and brings him back to the states where he can be treated by doctors and scientists.  But in the King Kong tradition, he escapes and goes on a rampage.  Can he be stopped?  While entertaining, it's more of a limp rehash of the first film.  There just doesn't seem to be anything new added to justify an entire film.

Not in the same league as Universal's ""Tarantula"", but it is a well done B-movie for a monster movie.  Highly recommended.  War of the Colossal Beast is ok for what it is, but it is the sequel to a movie that you can't find on DVD, The Amazing Colossal Man.  I'm not sure why they chose to release the sequel before the original, but if you didn't know about the original, you would be a little confused about this movie and you would ask questions about how this came to be as the movie picks up where the original leaves off.  The movie itself is ok, but in the original at least the giant man talks, whereas in this one, he just grunts, screams and yells his way throughout the movie.  Since he fell off a cliff or something in the first one, he is hideously scarred and ugly in this one, and his temperament is less than friendly, but you wouldn't know that without having seen the first one.

In retrospect, I'm very grateful to him for many hours of enjoyment in that dark movie house. Yeah, these effects are nowhere what is done now, but I didn't know that at that time. I was just a kid in awe of what was on the screen.  I loved ""The Spider"" (as it was called back then).  The remake was a real letdown for those of us who enjoyed seeing the overhead shot of a girl screaming her head off, with her 50's skirt caught in the door of her car as the spider approaches.  I love the idea that rock 'n roll awakens the spider, who then goes on a rampage all over town.  And, yeah, that poor baby alone on a deserted street was very a disturbing sight.  Mr. BIG was all about bringing entertainment to the masses, ready to scare us, thrill us and giving us our money's worth for an afternoon.

441206,5,6302136296,"Yes, after a long wait, Earth vs The Spider is released on DVD, along with the sequel, War of the Colossal Beast to Bert I Gordons pretty good movie The Amazing Colossal Man.
The Spider is my favorite of the two and oddly enough I find it a lot more interesting and more well paced then Universals Tarantula! The story isn't that bad, it involves a giant spider(a tarantula) that lives in a cave and then goes on a rampage through a town. The actors for most part aren't that bad. Sure, they have practically no character development, but their really enjoyble to watch. Ed Kemmer plays a really likeable science teacher, but the star of acting in this little gem is Gene Roth who is an absolute hoot as the doubting sheriff! The effects are basically putting a tarantula next to a postcard and making it crawl over it,or using split screen photography but it works rather well and the spider causes quite a lot of mayham and gets a decent amount of screen time. The spider screams and roars in a creepy sort of way, but I enjoyed it's evil howl! The famous Carlsbard Cave settings are  put to good use, and they even have a huge spiderweb in it!(really a net, but again, it looks pretty well). Odd that such a low budget film used a web and not Tarantula..
The climax of the film is intense, and for some reason I get a chill when the camera zooms in on the dead corpse of the electrocuted spider impaled on a stalgmite...
Anyway, Albert Glasser provides a decent score and the movie is very well paced; there are practically no slow parts. I really like this movie (best giant spider flick, and best Bert Gordon movie)Note:teens in this movie are about 30, so I had a good laugh at that. Also, when the spider comes back to life in the gym, the rock music DOES NOT AWAKEN IT!!! I keep explaining to people, the DDT wore off, and the spider went back to life!
Pros- Spider, spider's howl and web, fun characters, good music, interesting set design, good props such as spider victims bodies and giant spider leg, well paced.
Cons-none, its pure B-movies Gold!!!

War of the Colossal Beast is a good example of an inferior sequel to an original. It seems Colonel Glenn Manning survived his rather big fall from the Dam, but is missing half of his face and is in an entirelly different state. Now living in the desert, he raids unsespecting food trucks. When captured,he frees himself and goes on a rampage. Now characters for the most part suck. Their not interesting and have no charm to them...their just cardboard cutouts. The Colossal Man is played by a different actor, and sounds like a pregnant cow..and is literally quite boring. He does nothing new. On the bright side, the makeup is rather well done, and looks interesting. The matting is rather well done, but nothing we haven't seen in the Amazing Colossal Man. Do yourself a favor and see the original
Pros- Good makeup, music, last scene is in color
Cons-boring characters, not so good effects, col manning sounds like a pregnant cow",1145923200,6,2996,4.536044362292052

441208,4,6302136296,"At first I wondered at this particular pairing of Bert I. Gordon classics but when I realized that both movies involve giant menaces eliminated in the same way it became clear.

First we have Earth Vs. The Spider (often listed on TV as The Spider).  Here a small town witnesses and battles a giant spider that lives in a nearby cave.  It take a while for the town to realize what is going on as the first witnesses are kids.  But soon the hunt is on and the town mobilizes to eliminate the giant arachnid.  No explanation is ever given during the movie for the

creature's great size.  I often wonder if there had been tentative plans for a sequel.  Whatever the case, this is a wonder film of giant menaces.  Unlike similar films, there is no delay in seeing the monster and it gets plenty of screen time.

War of the Colossal Beast is the second feature and is the sequel to The Amazing Colossal Man.  The Colossal Man was though to have perished when he fell from a huge dam at the end of the first movie.  But here we quickly discover he is alive if not well and preying upon food trucks for sustenance.  He is eventually captured as folks from the first film try to communicate with him and bring him back to sanity.  But is the giant disfigured man beyond hope or can he be redeemed by the scientists or the love of his sister?  Only watching the film will answer the questions.  There is one odd bit where the film suddenly goes from black and white to color right near the end.

While I would have liked a double feature of the two Colossal Man films the two selected for this disk do go well together.  The disk lack anything ib the way of special features but does have separate menus for each film.  Both films are on one side of the disk so there is no need to flip it over.

I didn't know that Nicholson & Arkoff had separate control over the various films. Certainly, AIP knew how to market their films, with the drive-in crowd, the brilliant Roger Corman doing Poe, and the Beach Party movies with Frankie and Annette. They even got an Oscar nomination once, for ""Wild in the Streets"" (Editing). They also had terrific product placement ads, like in ""The Spider"", promoting Puppet People; Dorothy Malone putting on a record (in ""Beach Party"") with an AIP label; and more. I agree that the Colossal Man movies should've been put together on a disc; the other ""Cult Classics"" DVD released by Lions Gate (How to Make a Monster/Blood of Dracula) was wonderful, and I hope they keep doing it. Perhaps now I understand why ""Invasion of the Saucermen"", ""It Conquered the World"", ""The Day the World Ended"", and, best of all, ""Not of this Earth"", haven't been released.

Both of the films were made by the amazing Bert I. Gordon. The ""I"" was for Incredible.  Earth Vs. The Spider (1958 - 73m) all you have to know about this film - it's big spider. This was a busy year for Bert because he also gave us War of the Colossal Beast (1958 - 69m) - (along with Attack of the Puppet People - part of MGM's Midnite Movies series). We thought we saw the last of Col. Glenn Manning, a man who grew to 60 feet tall after getting too close to an atomic blast. But now he's back and not looking too good - he really should use more lotion.

Both of these films are Psychotronic gems. I remember seeing both Colossal films on Channel 56's Creature Double Feature in Boston. Do hope the Nicholson estate gets their titles onto high quality DVD releases.",1133395200,84,1060,4.29
441244,3,6302136296,"Earth Vs. the Spider, and you've got to love the dramatic sound of that title even if it isn't remotely accurate, came out in 1958 on the downside of the giant bug craze that began with ""Them"" in 1954.  The film was directed by legendary B director Bert I. Gordon who directed such B movie classics as ""The Amazing Colossal Man"", ""War of the Colossal Beast"" and ""Picture Mommy Dead"".

This is yet another mutated by radiation giant bug movie that is inferior to 1955's Tarantula in every way but still kind of a fun film, if for nothing else the sheer ridiculousness of the whole thing.  A couple of teenagers are out searching for one's missing father and come upon a cave which is the lair of a giant spider.  The kids escape and return with local law enforcement officers as well as a teacher and spray it with DDT, apparently killing it.  But the monster is just unconscious and it's put on display in the high school gym.  While practicing for a school dance a band's rock music awakens the spider from it's slumber and of course it goes on a rampage before it's eventually cornered and destroyed back in its cave lair.

OK, it's pretty lame in terms of effects...bad models, and trick photography of real tarantulas which are obviously very different in appearance.  Plus bad perspective of the spider as it seems to change size from shot to shot.  But part of that is the charm of Bert I. Gordon.  The acting is of course lame by the mostly no-name cast.  One note is that the school janitor is played by Hank Patterson who went on to play Fred Ziffel in Green Acres as well as a recurring role for several years in Gunsmoke.

7822843,3,6302136296,"Released in 1958 and shot in B&W, Earth vs. the Spider details the events of a small town in Southern California when a colossal spider living in a cave comes to town.

While Earth vs. the Spider is great when you're 8 years-old its flaws surface when viewed as an adult. For one, the spiders size changes according to the sequence: In the cave its huge, but when its on display at the school its noticeably smaller; then when it traverses the town its gargantuan. Inconsistencies like this don't make for great movies. Its entertaining in some ways, like being a period piece of the late 50s, but it pales in comparison to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and the monumental Forbidden Planet (1956). It doesnt help that colossal animal/monster movies made in the decades since are just all-around better, including being in color. Still, Earth vs. the Spider is worth catching if you favor these kinds of flicks and want to go back in time to the late 50s, not to mention there are some effective elements, like the horrific sounds the spider makes and the drained remains of its victims.

The film runs 73 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California, with additional footage from Carlsbad Caverns National Park.
