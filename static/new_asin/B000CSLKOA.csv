8101820,5,B000CSLKOA,"I liked this presentation of one mans biased opinion that I mostly found I agree with, as well as being entertaining.  I would recommend watching this and Scott's other film and then using Consumers Reports as your main guide if your in the market to buy a car.",1190505600,,261,4.4375
8101821,5,B000CSLKOA,"If Roger Ebert,  Car and Driver, and Jackass  ever made a movie together, this would be it.. It's smart, eccentric, and obsessed with cars. It isn't however, obsessed with specs and really seems to understand that no real enthusiast cares if a cheap crappy car can out-accelerate a much superior car in a different price class. What the presenter focuses on is that certain X-factor in cars--the way really bad cars can be good while great cars can be boring. And the destruction sequences show how even those dull cars can be fun because you never know what's going to happen next.

I usually find ""comparison tests"" to be completely useless since they always end up with a cop out--saying they like them both. But free from advertisers, his blatant and unbiased opinions could reduce a car manufacturer to tears.

Most of the shots are obviously well thought out with many camera angles. The writing is excellent and the editing is top notch. It's lighthearted and funny yet still manages to get down to business with serious conclusions. The thing is, the car he singled out as the worst one ever, I happen to own. But it was impressive to see it driven off a cliff and watching it still go until being blown up.

If you are looking for nerdy scientific testing, look elsewhere. You don't have to know anything about cars to find this DVD entertaining.",1139961600,,1355,4.676470588235294
