4228139,5,B003YCI238,"The Geraldine McEwan series of Agatha Christie's ""Miss Marple"" mysteries are perfect for a night at home with a mug of hot chocolate.  The adventure and mystery is there in spades and foul language is nowhere to be found - thank goodness.

Christie's brilliant work and McEwan's sensitive acting keep one's eyes and ears riveted to the screen so as to miss not a single word or action.  One thinks that so-and-so is the culprit but almost every time the outcome is a complete surprise.

Great value and wonderful entertainment.",1301443200,9,527,4.822222222222222
4228140,4,B003YCI238,Geraldine McEwan is my favorite Miss Marple along with Margaret Rutherford.  Both collections of the Christie stories offer some of the best takes on the novels.  McEwan's turn in both Vanity Fair and this collection are not to be missed.,1292889600,22,238,4.925
4228141,1,B003YCI238,"Someone asked me to add ""SPOILER ALERT"" regarding my review and the following comments.  My complaint has to do with gross alteration of murder plots and characters, and you can't make that case without issuing SPOILERS.  However, the spoilers pertain only to this set of movies, not to the books nor to other screen adaptations of the same stories.  That should tell you something.

Original review follows...
-----------------------------------------------------------

The good part:  The actors, sets, costumes, cars and dialog were well-done.  Geraldine McEwan is a delight.

And it is true that books suffer when condensed to the form of a screen play.  If you can't read the book in 90 minutes, then you can't put the whole book on the screen in 90 minutes.  Things have to be simplified or edited out.  This is true.

However...

This series of movies plays fast and loose with Agatha Christie's plots and characters.  How loose?

In ""Nemesis"" the murderer of Verity turns out to be a nun.  A nun?  And she doesn't drink the poison.  That makes the title of the story rather moot.

In ""The Body in the Library"" the murderers turn out to be a lesbian couple.

""By the Priking of my Thumbs"" is a Tommy and Tuppence story, not a Jane Marple story.  The writers plucked Tommy from the plot and jammed Miss Marple into the cavity like a transplanted kidney.  And they turned Tuppence into a lush.

Somewhere in there they crossed the line from necessity to disrespect.  One shudders to think what they would have done to Poirot.",1291075200,30,1531,4.822393822393822
4228142,5,B003YCI238,"McEwan debuted as Miss Marple in late 2004 and soon received a best actress nomination and the show was nominated as ""Outstanding"" twice including an Emmy. She's played crime before as Lucia in Mapp & Lucia AND she was Mrs. Tripp in Wallace & Gromit films. In 2003, Geraldine was chosen to play Agatha Christie's Jane Marple. She retired in 2007 from that role after completing 12 hugely popular two-hour mysteries. This set is the complete series of Marple stories with McEwan as the `Lady Sherlock.' 12 feature-length Agatha Christie Marple tales. Rather bully jollification!
Ms McEwan: ""I imagine there must be people who don't like the changes but I personally feel that probably Agatha Christie wouldn't mind. A book becomes something else once it's dramatized. But what you want to be is faithful to the original essence of Agatha Christie.""

Casts were super with stars like Joanna Lumley, Derek Jacobi (Cadfael), well the description lists many and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Locations are as fantastic as those in ""Foyle's War"", ""Brideshead Revisited"", and ""Midsomer Murders."" Costumes are just as wonderful.
CC subtitles are available for those of us who like them.

I really liked this Marple actress. Past complaints reappear as always when the actress playing Miss Marple is changed. But this time, it seems to have worked to advantage. Also there were, back in the original airing days, complaints about overacting. It didn't quite seem real. Get real complainers of the past. It's fiction. Anyone thinking a senior-aged female would be outdoing all of the police detectives of Britain is not quite together themselves. It is fun crime entertainment, with tongue-in-cheek realism, just right for a night on the sofa with a bowl of popcorn.

4228166,2,B003YCI238,"Geraldine McEwan is a fine actress and the production values for the series is quite good, but the choice of McEwan as Miss Marple is totally miscast.  The character, plot and dialog is a serious departure from the source material and diminishes the quality and impact of Christie's work.
While one may look at these as contemporary variations, they chose to alter the wrong elements.  There have been many incarnations and interpretations of charter and the stories, and these are by no means the least faithful attempt, but after the Joan Hickson series, these pale by comparison.  Perhaps if this is your first introduction to Christie and Miss Marple you may find them enjoyable, but I think for those of us who
are already familiar with the material will find them interesting only as examples of where the production went wrong.",1466640000,2,834,4.900709219858156

4228186,5,B003YCI238,"I love a good mystery and had become hooked on Hercule Poirot years ago but could not develop enthusiasm for Miss Marple after seeing one of the early shows. But PBS mysteries ran a few episodes starring Julia McKenzie and I thought to myself ""that's how Miss Marple should be"".  Picked up a couple of DVDs from my library only to realize these had Geraldine McEwan. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Ms. McKenzie and think she makes a fantastic Miss Marple, but for me Ms McEwan IS Miss Marple (it's like Doctor Who - everyone has their favorite Doctor even though all of them are wonderful). It's the subtle things she does - a raised eyebrow, twinkling eyes, the big sigh - that really bring the character life. Having all of her movies in one set was too enticing to pass up. It's the English cozy mystery at it's best and no one did it better than Agatha Christie. And while some of my favorite episodes were not written with Miss Marple, they still stayed very true to the actual stories and lost nothing at all by her addition (yes I know, Tommy & Tuppence and Superintendent Battle were reduced to a pittance or removed totally and I do feel their loss but it was still handled beautifully that unless you were familiar with the stories you wouldn't notice anything).

4228232,5,B003YCI238,"I can't speak to whether or not the stories have been changed dramatically from the actual books they're based upon, but I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching all three seasons of ""Agatha Christie's Marple"" staring Geraldine McEwan, which are collected here in this very affordable set AGATHA CHRISTIE'S MARPLE: THE GERALDINE MCEWAN COLLECTION DVDs.

There's over 19-hours of mysteries to get involved in and I enjoyed McEwan's portrayal.

If you read my other review for the fifth season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Marple-Complete-Series-5-Blu-ray/dp/B004VLYHQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Marple: Complete Series 5 [Blu-ray</a>] you'll know that I started with that season and so I'm working my way backwards into this show. Anyway, I really enjoyed season 5 and so I decided to get this collection; I'm glad that I did.

Even though there is a cast change after season three and Julia McKenzie takes over the role of ""Jane Marple"" from Geraldine McEwan, both actresses do a fine job in it. Now I've read some of the other reviews who felt that neither actress did justice to the character, or felt that Joan Hickson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Marple-3-Feature-Length-Mysteries-The-Body-in-the-Library-A-Murder-Is-Announced-A-Pocketful-of-Rye/dp/B000068UE9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Marple - 3 Feature Length Mysteries (The Body in the Library / A Murder Is Announced / A Pocketful of Rye)</a>) was the definitive Miss Marple, but I enjoyed all three.

Mind you that I've only read one Christie story, ""The Blue Geranium,"" so I'm not at all an aficionado of Christie or her characters, but I found the mysteries on this collection entertaining and I'll be watching them over and over again. The scenery, music, cinematography, clothing and set decoration is absolutely gorgeous and each episode is a finely honed story.

However some die-hard fans of the books have have not been pleased with story tweaks and reworkings, but I think if you enjoy mysteries and British accents, and aren't too much of a Christie purist, you'll really enjoy these shows.

Here's a run down of the special features on the set:

***  SERIES 1  ***

4228233,5,B003YCI238,It is a genuine pity McEwan past away. She is far and away the best actress to ever play Jane Marple.,1358380800,5,101,3.857142857142857
4228234,5,B003YCI238,"The plots are more updated.  There is only so many times you can redo The Body In The Library, etc. So throw in a couple of lesbians in uptight 1950's, and there you go! It would have been funnier with a couple of gays, but lesbians are kinder and gentler.  I enjoyed the new plots, but my favorites are mysteries that Marple was never originally in.  Some of the actors (especially Eileen Atkins) are marvelous.

Miss Marple this time around is more of a Bohemian, puckish kind of sleuth. Kind of cute, hippie Miss Marple.  It fits Geraldine McEwan's petite size. I do love Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, but this is a nice change.  With Hickson, she's prim and proper.  With Julia McKenzie a warm, rather stout Miss Marple.  They are all good actors.

So give the new versions a chance.  They'll grow on you.",1356566400,14,808,4.472602739726027
4228235,1,B003YCI238,"And yet again, Acorn releases another collection without Subtitles for the Hearing Impaired. Come on people, this is 2012, and all disabilities should be accommodated by this time. There is simply no excuse for this oversight. And what is the most aggravating, is that the UK versions all have subtitles, what is up with that?? Blatant discrimination in my view. Acorn WAKE UP!",1351036800,10,377,5.0
4228236,1,B003YCI238,"Unfortunately these rewrites of Christie classics are anything but ""true to the spirit"" of Agatha Christie.  She must be spinning in her grave with indignation over these travesties.

Characters are dropped, others are made up and inserted for little or no reason.  Teenage characters (13 and 16 years old, main characters in different stories) are portrayed as being older than the same character in the novels and far more sophisticated (if you equate a certain type of sexuality with ""sophistication"").

All the older characters drop a full generation, so that middle-aged characters are now twenty-somethings and elderly characters are now merely middle aged.  EVERYBODY is far better looking than in real life OR the novels.  Culprits are changed and the sexuality of main characters is modified.  ""Romantic"" themes that were not present in the original stories, usually involving main characters that were invented solely for these TV episodes, are inserted for little or no reason, and add not a thing to the main story line.

As for Geraldine McEwan being the ultimate Marple, sorry, but she's not.  This ""Marple"" bears little resemblance to the Jane Marple of the books.  There is nowhere near enough of the wry humor of the original, nor of the air of genteel poverty that Miss Marple lives in, as is clear throughout the original Christie tales.  She has an ""income"" but it is not sufficient to keep her in true comfort; hence she trains young girls who want to ""go into service"" for that little bit of extra income and/or in exchange for their services while they are in training, and in her declining years she is largely supported by her nephew.

In particular, Miss Marple wouldn't have been caught dead dressing like a dowdy charwoman, which is what the wardrobe choices for her in these episodes make her look like.

Main characters are relegated to becoming bit parts, disappear altogether, or are warped into totally unrecognizable caricatures of stereotypical types that bear absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the originals; in one case, the original character of a bumbling country priest is transmogrified into a snarling raving Nazi.  The character isn't the only thing about that story that's insane; whoever mangled these stories for the sake of ""modernizing"" the scripts ought to be stood up against a wall somewhere and summarily shot.

These stories have not been improved by any stretch of the imagination.  Instead, they've been mangled into near unrecognizability, with Christie's witty, gentle, loving character studies being replaced by prurient sensationalist ""plots"" that are about as subtle as the blunt object the murder victim gets clubbed with.

Don't confuse these travesties with the fine productions staring Joan Hickson.  She didn't quite capture all of Miss Marple's character - she's just a tad bit too severe - but she at least rang true to the era and the character, even if incompletely.  She just didn't have the ""birdlike"" quality Miss Marple of the novels has, but she hit almost every other Marple note dead on.  The wry wit, the gentle but inexorable sharpness of her intellect, her masterful and largely non-judgmental grasp of the vagaries of human existence; Joan Hickson got those all dead on.  Of course she was undoubtedly helped no end in her portrayal by being given scripts that are as true to the original novels as possible. Miss Marple fits into that world as created by Christie for her.  Change that, and the Miss Marple you get is something wholly different and entirely (in these cases) unsatisfactory.",1349913600,28,3577,5.068259385665529
4228237,3,B003YCI238,"It pains me to write this review as I think Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of Miss Marple is charming. She captures the mischievousness I have always thought was a brilliant undertone in the books.

Howver, as an adaptation, there was just too MUCH adapting... I think any of Dame Christie's books could be screenplays in themselves and much prefer her storylines than the ones in these shows.

I also was a bit put off in that 2 of the shows were not even orginally Miss Marple books; Sittaford House was GREATLY altered and I thought lost a lot of its charm.

As individual movies they are nice, but as Miss Marple adapations? I think not!",1348876800,3,639,4.587719298245614

4228239,5,B003YCI238,"Geraldine McEwan series of Agatha Christie's ""Miss Marple"" is fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed each of the installments of mystery, murder, and the keen eye of Miss Marple.  Geraldine McEwan is wonderful in the series, and each inspector learns quickly of her wit and gift for snooping that always solves the murder. I love how she picks up an unsuspecting amateur snoop to teach along the way, and her nail biting endings when she reveals the true culprit. Usually, I get it wrong each time, which is the fun surprise of mystery.  The scenes from the various locations from the coast of England to the buzzing hotel in the heart of London are wonderfully shot with detail and wonder of the English way of life. Frankly, I think this series tops them all, including the great actors that grace each episode. Well done, Miss Marple!",1340496000,4,831,4.756944444444445
4228240,5,B003YCI238,"Full disclosure: I'm very particular about my Marples. When it comes to Poirot, there's no argument that David Suchet is THE Poirot, but who is the real Marple? Geraldine McEwan is the winner, in my mind.

Are the plots of the movies altered from the original books? Yes. I actually prefer that to be honest. I've read every Agatha Christie novel so many times that it wouldn't really be a ""mystery"" to me if they hadn't changed the plots a bit, and I do like what they've done with some of them. In addition, the characters are, in some cases, a bit more stylized and over-the-top than I believe Agatha Christie intended. But the sets are fabulous, the clothes and makeup are spot-on and, as I said, Geraldine McEwan is a treasure.

If you're a purist, maybe these aren't for you. But speaking as someone who adores Agatha Christie, these adaptations are delightful.",1337990400,51,867,4.660130718954249

I've seen numerous actresses play the part, however, and McEwan's portrayal is the one I've enjoyed most, possibly because she is so likeable.  She brings warmth and sympathy to the role that seems lacking in the others.  The characters seems to care about the people who are being impacted by the events around them.  This may not fit a purist's preference, but when I spent time with a character on TV, it's nice when they're the kind of people I'd enjoy in any setting.",1526601600,,584,4.8

I understand from some reviewers that the stories have been changed and I do notice that ridiculous plot 'updating' is going on that I am positive Agatha Christie did not have in her original stories, and which I believe is poetic license of the worst kind. That being said, each mystery is still a first quality effort with fine setting, scripting, editing, music, directing, and performances. I absolutely love a good mystery and though Geraldine McEwan is a bit too impish I feel for Miss Marple (I now prefer Julia McKenzie's balanced nuance of Miss Marple more than any other portrayals so far) I still feel she brings a sweet and lovable charm to Miss Marple that is fun to enjoy.
