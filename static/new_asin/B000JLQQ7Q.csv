2675441,4,B000JLQQ7Q,I really think this is a chick flick but even my hubby found it entertaining.  I'm glad I bought a DVD copy for my DVD/VHS library.,1173744000,3,131,4.038461538461538
2675442,3,B000JLQQ7Q,"Synopsis: What happens when a beautiful American girl on vacation in Mexico awakens one morning with no recollection of what happened the night before? This may not be such a big deal unless that girl happens to wake up and herself married to a handsome, naked Mexican male laying beside her. Quite a intolerable predicament when you consider that it's just twenty-four hours before she is scheduled to marry another man!

So the tale begins of bewildered and hung over Melissa (Laura Prepon from the `That 70's Show') and the good looking Mexican local Carlos (Matt Cedeno from the `El Pollo Loco' commercial) begin their madcap adventure to discover what happened the night before and what they intend to do about it.

Critique: This is one of those made-for-television movies predicated on the belief that matching two young, attractive and popular personalities in a light, romantic comedy is always a good thing. Well, they got it half right. Matt Cedeno is quite charming and likeable, but conversely Laura Prepon tends to be somewhat boorish as she continually rants and raves about how this unexpected situation may ruin her otherwise perfectly planned life. This film is definitely not for someone looking for a little sustenance in their evening entertainment. But, if you're a teenage girl stuck home for the night Matt Cedeno just might fit the bill.",1172966400,9,1362,5.022123893805309
2675443,4,B000JLQQ7Q,"Though it's that obvious typical meant-for-each-other-but-they-don't-know-it comedy, Romancing the Bride is an outrageous romantic comedy about what happens when a bride with a perfectly planned wedding wakes up married to a perfect stranger twenty-four hours before her wedding.

The movie originally opened on the oxygen network and stars Laura Prepon (That 70s Show), Carrie Fischer (Star Wars) and Matt Cedeno (Days of Our Lives). Melissa (Prepon) has been planning her perfect wedding for two years only to wake up married to a gorgeous stranger, Carlos (Cedano) the morning before her big day. With no memory of the night before, Melissa and Carlos set out on an adventure to annul their marriage so she can get to her real wedding in time. On the way they survive a brush with the law, burning buildings and a hair-raising encounter with Edwina (Fischer), the mother of all mothers of the bride.

Two Favorite Quotes:

EDWINA (to Melissa): What do you think your father would say if he saw you chained to this nearly naked Mexican man?

Carlos: Hey i'm wearing clothes.

Edwina: That leave nothing to the imagination. I can practicly see your religion, and it lists to the left.

AND

Melissa: [When her aunt asks who Carlso is] He's my hairstylist.

Carlos: No I'm not.

Melissa: Fine, hair designer. You know how uppidy the gays get with their titles.",1164499200,11,1360,4.955947136563877

2675453,5,B000JLQQ7Q,"I thought at first that this is your typical Hollywood movie where girl falls in love with guy and they live happily ever after.

2675462,3,B000JLQQ7Q,"It's okay.  Not a great rom-com but not totally lousy.  It's uncomfortably a little racist at times, especially the scenes with the bride's mother (Carrie Fisher).  Laura Prepon acts the same as she always does: dry and  sarcastic with a monotonal vocal delivery.  Story is predictable but cute--think a Harlequin romance.  Remove the borderline racism and change the female lead, and it would have been much better.",1278115200,,416,5.134328358208955
2675463,5,B000JLQQ7Q,"This is a surpisingly fun and funny movie. How does a bride to be wake up with a man in her bed who claims to be her husband on the day before her ""real"" wedding? The movie travels back with a pretty decent explanation of how this could have happened. The best lines come from Carrie Fisher as the bride's mother. By the way, what is up with her mouth? Bad dentures? On purpose? It's worth watching just to try to solve that mystery. And regardless, the actor who plays the new and unexpected husband is worth watching....trust me.",1273190400,,531,4.373737373737374
2675464,4,B000JLQQ7Q,"This is a very light weight romantic comedy with wonderful scenery of Mexico, a light weight comic plot and pleasant leads.  Both are adept and keep the movie floating along nicely.  What works best of all is the wonderful Carrie Fisher as the bride's mother from hell.  She is hysterically funny and steals every scene she is in; which is saying a lot given the physical perfection of the leads!  You are not going to think much during this movie, but it will give you a pleasant 90  minutes in a great climate with some fun people.",1268956800,,533,4.453608247422681
2675465,4,B000JLQQ7Q,This movie was extremely funny to watch especially with cheesecake and champagne! I highly recommend it if you want to enjoy a romantic comedy with great eye candy on a night in.,1233014400,,178,4.59375
2675466,4,B000JLQQ7Q,"A good choice for a romantic comedy.  I seen this movie on lifetime once & bought it that night.  It is corky ... but come it, it's a MOVIE (it's not supposed to be like real life)!  I love the cast, it was great to see Carrie Fisher (she is too funny) & everyone really blended well together on screen.  Over all, I really do like it & the funny slapstick's that are packed into it.",1231286400,,383,4.0

2675469,4,B000JLQQ7Q,"I purchased this movie after seeing parts of it on Oxygen and always missing the beginning!  It's a charming romantic comedy with lots of laughs and a happy ending.  The plot is not complex and the ending very predictable, but it is enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend it as a nice movie to watch on a rainy day.",1198713600,2,315,4.305084745762712

2675472,4,B000JLQQ7Q,"Uptight bridezilla Melissa (Laura Prepon) is in Mexico to have the perfect wedding, but instead wakes up in an unfamiliar bed hung over after two many shots of ""Mexican Moonshine"" with a strange man lying next to her. When Carlos (Matt Cedeno) tells her they are married, she doesn't believe him. As she scurries to return to her hotel and clear up the mishap and get annulled so she can marry longtime fiance Brian, every thing that can go wrong, does. From being chased by the police to accidentally burning down the records hall, Carlos insists that he won't let her annul their union until she realizes why she eloped with him in the first place. As things slowly come back to her, will she marry her fiance or take the plunge with her new spouse?

Loosely based (very, very loosely based, as the only thing that was retained is Melissa's name and the fact that she woke up married in Mexico) on the Suzanne Forster novel ""Unfinished Business,"" the story is charming but lacking in the chemistry and sensuality that Forster brings to her novels. Originally broadcast on Oxygen network, it's a cute and fluffy movie.",1190073600,4,1119,4.680203045685279
2675473,5,B000JLQQ7Q,"This is a great romantic comedy, especially if you like your movies without gratuitous sex and swearing. It's a nice clean, funny movie. Matt Cedeno is eye candy girls, it's worth it just to watch him! Carrie Fisher plays the mother of the bride perfectly. Laura Prepon is really good at deadpan humor, remember her from ""That 70's Show""?",1179100800,,338,4.745762711864407
