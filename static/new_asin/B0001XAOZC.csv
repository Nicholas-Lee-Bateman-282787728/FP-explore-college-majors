8176085,5,B0001XAOZC,love those old Mexican westerns with all the gun play and singing,1488758400,,65,4.5
8176086,4,B0001XAOZC,Loved this movies of a masked hero. Only part that I find highly childish and really stupid is the disembodied hand roaming around. It serves no purpose at all and gives the movie a cheesy quality.,1440633600,,197,4.5
8176087,2,B0001XAOZC,It was stated that this movie had subtitles and it DOES NOT!  The film itself is okay but I was misinformed.,1392595200,,108,4.142857142857143
