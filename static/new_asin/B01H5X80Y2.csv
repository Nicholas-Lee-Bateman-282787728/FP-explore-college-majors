7781012,4,B01H5X80Y2,"Knucklebones is a solid  monster film with elements of Freddy and the monster Frankenstein.  It's violent, funny and has new star in the monster who's the master of snarky one-liners.

The special effects are good, the monster looks realistically hideous, and the writing, direction and photography are all rock solid. My only quibble is with some of the kids' acting. A couple of them looked more bored than scared.

I give this ""B monster"" movie a B+. I hope there are sequels because Knucklebones is good enough both as a monster and as a movie to warrant them.",1474934400,,564,4.724489795918367

I started remniscing about back in the day as I was watching it... Why the 3, you might ask?  Well, the acting was OK... The setting was OK... The bring more people in to kill was OK... It's 2016 and the acting should have been great... The action should have been great... And like I have already have mentioned that's it  2016... What was up with the naked super nice figure in the beginning of the movie????? It was meaningless... Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong... Being naked isn't as taboo as it used to be... So, there was no shock factor... Can I watch this again? Yes I can...",1474761600,4,721,4.217391304347826

Knucklebones put me in mind of Nightmare on Elm Street (the original!) mixed in with Ouija and any/all of those brilliant B-movies with Jeffrey Combs in them.
The girls were hot, the gays suitably clueless, the deaths imaginative and gory and Knucklebones wisecracks his way through the movie like a demonic Eddie Murphy!
I'd whole heartedly recommend this movie for a perfect night in with a few beers and a bucket of popcorn!
Loved it!",1474243200,2,612,4.941747572815534
7781016,4,B01H5X80Y2,"Knucklebones is a superior entry in the b-flick horror genre. I think it is as good, or better, than some of the early (and classic) Jason, Michael, and Freddy entries that resulted in very popular film franchises.

The premise is that Knucklebones is an ancient Sumerian demon that can be summoned (with a set of desiccated knucklebones, of course) to attack your enemies. If you don't ""play"" with him he turns on you. The Nazi's tried to use him as a supernatural weapon, with predictable results, and the bones used to summon him end up in Texas where some captured Nazis where held during WW2. Cut to 1970 - the bones are unwittingly used again in a factory, resulting in the death of many individuals. A young boy figures out how to banish Knucklebones, and the closure of the factory, along with the legend of the factory being haunted, results. Cut to the present day where the bulk of the film takes place. A young woman has just broken up with her boyfriend, attempts suicide, and is later taken by her best friend and another friend to the factory to get drunk and hook up with one of a duo of randomly selected dudes as some sort of therapy. After some drinking and snarky flirtation, the group decides to explore the abandoned factory. They find the summoning bones in a wall, go through the summoning ritual (after all, who doesn't want to get drunk and summon an ancient Sumerian demon? It's Friday night I guess that makes it all right...) and all hell breaks lose as the group members are hunted throughout the factory. Mix in some meth head metal thieves getting their just rewards and Knucklebones is on a roll...

Pro's: The production values are excellent, the acting is well done, the special effects (especially for the villain) are above average for a b-flick horror entry, and the script is pretty dang good. Con's: The monsters voice was unintelligible in some portions of the film. I get the fact that the intent was to make Knucklebones sarcastic and creepy (like a more skeletal Freddie), but the device they used to filter the actors voice wasn't the best way to do it. There are a couple of weaknesses in the plot where you really have to suspend disbelief; such as the aforementioned character taking her friend, who just attempted to commit suicide, to an abandoned, and allegedly haunted, factory to get drunk with a couple of horn dog loser men. That makes her either the best friend in the world, or the most clueless, you decide after watching the film. I generally don't give four stars to b-flick horror films, but this one deserved it. I'm hoping there is a sequel. I'd like to see what cast and crew could do with a larger budget. The film had an interesting twist at the end that would serve as a foreshadowing of a sequel. Bring on a Knucklebones franchise!

The film is a supernatural slasher flick, with the attendant gore one would expect in such a film, some nudity, and a few stomach churning scenes of self-mutilation.",1474070400,12,2966,4.634980988593156

7781021,4,B01H5X80Y2,"The film starts in 1944 with a satanic rite to raise a demon, then again in Texas at a garment factory in 1976, then 40 years later when Neesa Avery (Julin Jean) tries to kill herself over a guy. She lives, so her friends decide to do what everybody else does in this case, go to a haunted abandoned garment factory and drink...and maybe raise a demon with a couple guys with minds of adolescents.

This is a pleasant 1980's throwback. There was some light humor with an original ""Ghostbusters"" reference to its demon. Our demon had a ""Freddy"" style sense of humor, unfortunately they used a voice distorter so you have to listen carefully for the lines, which spoils the fun. Oh yes, on that same night some coke heads stealing copper coincidentally come to said factory.

7781091,3,B01H5X80Y2,"An OK horror movie -- neither great nor horrible.  Plot could not seem to pick or keep a direction but not the worst movie by any means.

Plot / Spoilers

Nazis (why is it always Nazis) are trying to experiment with or weaponized some sort of occult ritual.  A raggedy, bony demon appears and disposes of said Nazis.  Then, in the 1970's this same page / manuscript has appeared in a Texas garment factory.  Mass slaughter.

In the more or less present day, our heroine is dumped by her boyfriend / fianc and attempts suicide.  She survives but has a creepy near death experience.  While convalescing (and considering another suicide attempt), her friend Leggy Blonde convinces her go party with another friend and two guys -- who take them to the abandoned factory (which is in remarkable shape, has power, and a cleaning service apparently).  The three girls and two guys find a hidden box with...you guessed it, the manuscript.  It describes a method of summoning a demon, so of course they have to try...

The concept is interesting in some ways but again, flaws abound.  The demon makes various wisecracks, but this is not a horror comedy and there is no explanation for the wisecracks (an homage to Freddy Krueger, perhaps)?  There are a few twists and turns but most times the ""good"" parts are derailed with plot issues.",1481587200,2,1327,4.71304347826087
7781092,2,B01H5X80Y2,"Well, when a movie starts with a tit shot, you know it's going to be amazing right?!  Not!  At least they explain the ""creature"" background and lore well enough.  From the beginning the acting is horrendous.  When we do get to the haunted area, we get some stupid quotes from all of the character like ""That's what she said' and ""There's no such thing as ghost"".  We're introduced to a few ""valley girls"", one ""cowboy"", and a regular ""Joe"".  The dialogue moves way to fast especially from the beginning that they almost interrupt one another frequently and with basic mono-tone voices and they show little emotion in their faces.  I would think they were definitely going for a horror comedy here with the ""demon"" repeating ""That'd what she said"" and other stupid one liners.  I never once felt scared throughout this movie at all.  Granted, it is hard for me to get scared from horror movies, but I didn't even feel a foreboding inkling.  We didn't have enough people to kill off with that one group so let's get more people to come for basically no reason and add to the death count.  It has a random sex scene, but I won't say what happens around that time.  The movie even starts with boobs.  It has a good bit of boobage.  The ending is kind of predictable.  One of them has magical self-healing powers because I don't believe a person would survive being stabbed the through the chest like this person was (again, not naming).  Heck, two of them have super healing powers.  Every other person would've passed out from shock alone.  This is a slasher movie, so don't expect any real magic or supernatural outside of the demon being conjured.  The pluses were that the demon itself has a personality ever idiotic it may be and is somewhat humorous at times.  The special effect and gruesome parts look very well done.  It has a twist that is ok, but fairly predictable as well...it is an entertaining choice for an ending over all.  Maybe a one time watch for this one.",1481500800,3,1973,4.561253561253562

We have horney college kids, some beers, an abandoned factory, a wise cracking demon, and a lot of incredibly poor decisions.

Some of the acting is maybe a little blah, but the killings are pretty creative, we get a decent back story/mythology, and an ending that knocked my socks off.  Our mostly bland protagonist really takes it up a notch at the end.

It started out with a scene from WWII and then just jumps all over the place from there.  Although the premise of the demon knucklebones is a good one, the writer just fails to pull ANY of it together.",1481241600,,280,4.072727272727272
7781095,3,B01H5X80Y2,Not too bad. Reminiscent of 80's horror flicks. Knucklebones is a very witty demon. He'll crack you up.,1481241600,,103,4.777777777777778

7781099,3,B01H5X80Y2,"While the casting, the acting, and probably even a majority of the script could have used a bit of an overhaul, it's not quite as bad as what you usually see and have to compare it with. All in all, while it wasn't exactly an Awesomely Horrific or Chillingly Horrific Gorefest, it wasn't that bad either. While it tries hard to do both (with a dash of supernatural tossed in), it's ends up being just Average. You don't end up with that ""wish I could get my time spent watching it"" feeling. So it's still it's a pretty decent enough B-Movie. 3 Stars for the usual ""It's Okay"" feeling once it's over.",1480118400,,599,4.357142857142857

7781110,2,B01H5X80Y2,"Unless you like low budget type movies.  Lots of killing, but not inecessarily the same fashion as better horror movies.  Would wait to see if it hits Prime if you'really curious.",1475193600,,179,4.741935483870968
7781111,1,B01H5X80Y2,"This movie had potential. As others have noted, the production values are high, and the mythology could've worked - in the hands of a better director and scriptwriter. The movie is just not scary. The wise-cracking, paranormal serial killer has been done to death. But the worst thing about this film is how obvious it is that everyone responsible for putting this crap on the screen has a seriously f*&^ed up attitude toward women. Women in this film are routinely murdered for being sexual, and they are murdered in disgustingly sexually violent ways. Gee, movie, tell me what you really think about women. Even if the stupid murdering demon had been coherent (it's impossible to understand a word he says), or scary, the outright misogyny here left an awful taste in my mouth. Give it a pass - unless you're into that sort of thing.",1475107200,3,835,4.76551724137931
8764782,5,B01H5X80Y2,"I first dismissed this as another in a series of killer-boardgames movies that always go nowhere. I was pleasantly surprised to find out this is actually a cool little slasher movie that kept me interested until the end. The plot is simple. After a failed suicide attempt, a girl goes out with her friends and wind up in an abandoned textile mill. there they find the instructions for a ritual they mistake as a game. They unleash the demon ""Knucklebones"" who promptly makes killing his number one priority.

I own the Blu-ray of this movie and I have to say that while its obviously a low budget production, they make great use of their locations and the acting of star Julin Jean is top notch. I hope they can continue the series as Id like to see where this goes.",1533772800,,766,4.4714285714285715

I am a true horror fan, and agree this movie is 'bad'.  But damn if its not entertaining, and thats what a movie should be.  They are not all Citizen Kane  or The Exorcist.  This was pure fun.
