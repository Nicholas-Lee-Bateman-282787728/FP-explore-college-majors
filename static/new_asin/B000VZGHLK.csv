8220703,5,B000VZGHLK,"This is the first of a series of four films from the Hong Kong studios of Run Run Shaw, who passed away at 107 years old just this year (2014). He was actually a Chin Dynasty guy, born in mainland China during it's final dynasty. Xi You Ji, or Journey to the West / The Monkey Goes West, is a 500 year old Chinese classic that was and still is presented in parts in tea house stages and major halls all across the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. But as far as movies on this great story go, wars and the Cultural Revolution halted nearly all productions, forcing Run Run to set up business in English Hong Kong during the late 1950s.

Run Run ran a tight ship but he did have all the space, equipment and martial arts teachers / coaches at his disposal and it shows in this first film. You can see how good Hua Yueh was right from the start of his career here; he later became an icon in that ground breaking King Hu film Come Drink With Me. Ho Fan plays the Tang monk really well, it's hard to believe he became famous as an erotic film director later on! Peng Peng, a noted comedian of the day, impresses with his ability AND his body, which needs no rubber suit to play the oversized pig-like man form the classic novel. The music is Peking Opera influenced, but very nice, in particular the song at the end about eating the Tang monk's flesh is, despite the words, the loveliest piece in the movie.

This film has English and Mandarin subtitles, and is delivered in Mandarin Chinese. It is a Region 3 DVD so be sure you have an all region DVD player or one that can convert to Region 3 before you purchase this DVD. Made in 1966, this film came at a time when limited resources stopped most Chinese producers from even attempting to put great Chinese classics on film. This Shaw Brothers production impresses considering the times and limitations of the times. Highly recommended for fans of Wuxia / Shenmo and of the original Journey to the West.",1411516800,,1959,4.3497267759562845
