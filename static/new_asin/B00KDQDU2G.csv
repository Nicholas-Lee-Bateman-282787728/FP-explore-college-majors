6422152,4,B00KDQDU2G,"Ok don't know about fan, but this has a lot of T & A. If they spend as much time fighting aliens as each other the series would be 5 min. And the clothing seems to be the first thing to go in every fight. Now why a 4? I like the interaction between the primary male and female, and the introduction of a secondary female adds a little more depth. I ended sitting through most of the series at one time cause I needed just a little more video crack. Yes its kind of addicting. I'm on the fence about getting season 2.

6422154,5,B00KDQDU2G,"Otaku John here to review another great anime series: ""Freezing"" Season 1.  Ok, to start, this series does have a lot of ""Fan Service"", but that's the norm for this genre of anime where it usually takes place at an academy for gifted students who are either training to become soldiers against supernatural creatures (in this case invading aliens from another dimension) or sorcerers, etc.  Anyway, Freezing is a lot like Chivalry of a Failed Knight anime series, but in my opinion, its done better.  The characters are more well-developed and in-depth, and the storyline moves along faster with more action.  It's not Shakespeare, but it is definitely entertaining, and with multiple seasons to watch, I feel its definitely worth checking out.  The term ""Freezing"" is a battle technique used in this series by ""Limiters"" who are the male partners to ""Pandoras"", who are female warriors that have been genetically enhanced with supernatural-like powers which make them fit to fight the invading aliens.  There's a lot of action, but more importantly, I feel the real story is about friendships and trust between the two main characters who are both loners desperately in need of someone to share their feelings and friendship with.  All in all, a great series.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1503878400,,1296,5.0233644859813085
6422155,5,B00KDQDU2G,"Covering both Season 1 and 2, this is a very clever story. Lots of nudity and scores of bloody violent scenes(so it's definitely for the over 18 crowd). Basic plot is an academy of young girls who carry stigmata implants in their backs which give them unusually strong fighting strengths (each has her own specialty weapon). They're trained to combat one massive enemy called NOVAS that surface occasionally to destroy the earth. The girls require having a boy partner (called Limiters) that have the ability to cast special ""freezing spells"" through which the girls can attack and kill of the NOVAS. Also, the girls often get into spats among themselves while training against one another.

The character development of many of the girls are done extremely well. The same for a smaller group of boys. The plot has several twists and turns among the characters. The animation is well done, but what stands out is the quality of the script. The dialog is crisp and natural, thanks to the help of having several women with exceptional voice over talents. I counted at least 10 who have extensive anime experience and whose voices are readily recognized by many anime fans. (Especially Jamie Marchi in the role of Rona Linchen)! This is the biggest redeeming factor in both DVD's. Having the English dub version is essential for both DVDs.

The overall story (all 24 episodes, plus bonus OVAs) is well constructed, well written with a lot of imagination. Would rate both seasons among the best animes to surface in recent years. Definitely a 5-Star Rating.",1503187200,2,1553,4.901140684410646

6422163,5,B00KDQDU2G,"- Synopsis: Our protagonist of the story is a kind-hearted young man that enrolls at West Genetics Academy. Upon his immediate arrival, he notices someone that resembles his late sister: Satellizer. The heroine of this story. She's one of the top-ranked fighters within her year. She's not only sexy, but also brutal and formidable, too. Moreover, the main point of these academies is to train Pandoras (the female fighters), and Limiters (the males that act as support for Pandoras). Aside from each other, their common enemies are mysterious aliens that bring destruction in their path. It's the duty of these Pandora and Limiters to act as the sword and shield for humanity.

========================================================================================================

- Comments: This anime is suitable for mature viewers accustomed to the Ecchi genre. If this does not apply to you, please avoid this, as it is fan-service-heavy. This is a sadistic and stimulating anime with sexy girls and plenty of awesome fight scenes. All the Pandoras kick butt and have plenty of abilities that help them fight against each other and the aliens.

- Analysis: One of the things that is really unique about this anime is the roles of males and females. Typically, in reality and the virtual world, males are the ones put on the front line, while females tend to act as the support. If you are a gamer, this shouldn't come to any surprise. Although, many games are slowly progressing in a way that waters this concept down. This is an often overlooked concept in this anime. So, I respect that it was addressed. In short, the Pandoras (females), are the ones on the front lines, while Limiters (males) play the support role.

Another interesting concept is something that many people can find relatable. That is, not to judge a book by its cover. This is highly relevant to this anime. Females are often compared to flowers to represent how delicate and sensitive they may be, among other things. I hold onto the belief that females are comparable to roses. While they still can be delicate and pretty, they also have thorns. So if one lowers their guard,  that can result in a world of pain. Furthermore, females are also clever at conditioning males to act a certain way in various situations.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 DVDs and 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays. This is rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and strong sexual content. Uncensored and will show plenty of nudity. The approximate run-time is 5 hours. Also includes extra features such as 6 short OVAs.

- Conclusion: This is recommended only for mature viewers accustomed to the Ecchi genre. From brutal fight scenes, to sexy girls, this perverted, sadistic and butt-kicking anime is suitable for male viewers. There's plenty of character interactions, dialogue, flashy fight scenes, and of course, fan-service.

6422165,5,B00KDQDU2G,"In my opinion, Freezing (and I'm actually referring to both Seasons 1 & 2 here) is an anime fan service that doesn't have that much ecchi compared to some other fan services, unless of course you count the female characters' clothes sustaining near-constant damage in battle or the mid-episode ""eyecatches"", as they're called. But I'd say there's enough ecchi to keep you interested. There were a few instances that involved a certain girl being humiliated in a disgraceful manner (to put it lightly), but only a few. Then there's this other girl who doesn't seem to like wearing a swimsuit to the pool... ever. And what anime fan service would be complete without the overly flirtatious girl who continually tries to win the heart of the main girl's man, rhetorically speaking? If you're wondering why I've chosen not to name the three characters I mentioned, it's because I think it'd be better for you to learn their names and who they are for yourself. This is a great anime fan service with a well put together story featuring plenty of action and just enough ecchi to keep you interested. The OVAs (a special feature included with the Blu Ray/DVD sets for Seasons 1 & 2), however, are a different story. There's lots of ecchi in the OVAs. So if you're into ecchi, I think you'll enjoy the Freezing OVAs. Just remember that the OVAs are not canon to the series, even if some of them might seem like they ought to be.",1485820800,2,1421,4.642857142857143

6422188,3,B00KDQDU2G,"For me, the positives and negatives balanced out to a neutral. 3-star opinion of the series.  After watching the first five episodes that are nothing but upperclassmen brutally beating anyone who didn't bow down and beg forgiveness for not acknowledging their highness, I was trying to decide whether to watch the rest or not.  In two of the situations, the upperclassmen were in full sadistic, maniacal frenzy literally prepared to kill the second and first years students...and when leadership did step in, it was the second year students who got thrown in the brig.  Nothing like showing the school leadership supporting brutal bullying all in the name of some rigid hierarchy.  Makes me wonder how the school had enough students survive to become upperclassmen.

Anyway, the animation is good and there are characters with real stories.

The primary redeeming part of the story for me was when the upperclassmen finally got their arrogant butts kicked and they had to admit they weren't all they thought they were.

If you're looking for ecchi, love fights, and don't mind brutality for brutality's sake, then this is for you.",1441670400,4,1130,5.043010752688172

6422191,2,B00KDQDU2G,"Here is my 3/10 mangaupdates review for the originating manga and i pretty much saw the anime (the animation is a no budget mess of course) as this adapts vol 1-6: I stopped reading this mess after 5 (?) volumes but it is now reached 20, has 4 spin-offs and an official hentai companion series. I would like to point out that it focuses on rape which the main series misuses to high heaven too. What else is there too say besides that this is a mixture between a bad harem school life manga, a messy shonen action manga, a fetish porno with an art style that employs less variety of characters than i have fingers and is a waste of everybody's time due to an incomprehensible plot just like the rest of Dall-Young works. Don't even start or you will regret it. Go for the utterly incomparable Azumi (9/10) and Claymore (8,5/10) if you want to read a series about female warriors with a real edge. Or pick up real porn that isn't by him.",1436745600,2,936,4.323863636363637

The voice acting whether you prefer the Japanese or English is good. The most amusing thing for me was the fact this school is supposed to teach students about fighting the Nova dimensional aliens but who needs aliens when the students are trying to kill you. I guess if you are not good enough you were going to die anyways. The school is full of a bunch of bullies and the students in high ranking positions often just stand around and do nothing. They could have ended the fight in 2 seconds but they instead stand around looking helpless. The action scenes are quite brutal and Satelizer got beat up so much even Rocky Balboa would cover his eyes.

6422210,4,B00KDQDU2G,"Freezing was first shown in Japan in 2011. The plot follows a group of students at West Genetics. This is an academy for Pandoras and Limiters. Pandoras are female warriors who can use special powers through implanted devices called stigmata. Limiters are male warriors who can freeze enemies in their tracks. The principal character is a Pandora called Satelliser El Bridget. She is a troubled girl with immense power and some serious problems too. The school is strongly hierarchical (not unlike West Point) and the first episodes concern the battles that Satelliser fights with other students and how she comes to accept her own limiter called Kazuya Aoi. Kazuya has his own issues and the relationship between the two is developed nicely. The action sequences are very good and their is some fan service but it doesn't detract from the film and is mostly incidental. The series came alive in the last three episodes as we learn more about their otherworldy enemies (Nova) and the genesis of the Pandoras.
I have the combined DVD/Blu-Ray set and I note that the 9th episode of the blu-ray stopped/froze on my PS3. The DVD worked fine though.",1419984000,7,1144,4.902061855670103

8657897,4,B00KDQDU2G,"First and foremost, while I expected there to be SOME of this, given the premise of how the augmented female characters work together with men, there is a LOT of upper body nudity. ""Fan service"" is almost constantly taking place in some form, almost to the point of absurdity. With that in mind I'd say this was an R rated series, as well as it's second season. If you like that stuff or can at least tolerate it, then the story itself is genuinely worth it. Oh and before I forget, there is a lot of blood and even severed limbs, if you don't like that stuff either.

I purchased the two seasons because the wiki pages indicated a strong story, and in that regard there is, although not the kind of story the wiki had led me to believe. I was expecting something similar to the original Neon Genesis Evangelion, but with augmented human beings defending the world from the monsters instead of giant armored lab grown organisms.

What I got was a story detailing how the lead male and female were brought together, facing a social conflict among their own kind up until the last episode or two when the Nova entities they were trained to fight finally appear and make an assault on their training grounds.

I suppose anything after here is spoilers but if you want a bit more detail:

Early on the lead male, Kazuya, mistakes the lead female, Satelizer, for his long dead sister (who was also a Pandora, one of the augmented woman trained to fight the extradimensionals) and embraces her. Satelizer, for reasons that they get to later in the first season and resolve in the second season, has a reputation for breaking the limbs of anyone who touches her, to the point where she has not chosen a male to act as her ""limiter"", which is necessary to counter the effects of a movement limiting force the aliens emit. Kazuya's embrace interferes with an annual event designed to determine strength and ranking between the female pandora characters, and leads to her losing first place. After realizing what he's done, Kazuya only wants to make it up to her, and grabs her hand several times, ignoring the warnings of classmates about her tendencies.

It quickly becomes apparent that Satelizer is able to handle his touch without freaking out and breaking limbs(something nobody understands at first). At first Kazuya insists on becoming her limiter at every opportunity in an attempt to make up for causing her loss of rank, and winds up getting to see her true side since he's the only one not afraid to go near her, including defending her in dangerous situations. Satelizer doesn't want to see the one person who's shown her any humanity get hurt or worse, and keeps trying to send him away. Their interactions lead to Kazuya wanting to be with her, rather than just make things up to her, and Satelizer develops similar feelings.

Kazuya discovers he can emit freezing fields without receiving a ""baptism"" from a pandora, something Satelizer is afraid of doing per her phobia despite being able to tolerate his touch. Kazuya uses this to his advantage to protect Satelizer several times, and when it becomes clear she cannot dissuade him not matter the danger, she accepts him as her limiter though warns him she cannot baptize him. Throughout this relationship a conflict results between her and another pandora, which causes other senior students to try putting them in their place, although Satelizer is really just defending herself and Kazuya and has ""Never surrender, don't give in to anyone"" mentality. The bonds they develop with one another prepares them for the big battle in the end of the season.",1528502400,,3609,4.748006379585327

8657899,4,B00KDQDU2G,"This is my 2nd Blu-ray anime I've ever bought. The Anime looks great without a doubt, I'm currently reading the manga as well which is fairly different, but I do some similarities ( trying not to spoil anything). The only down side to this purchase is that 5.1 is supported in english dub, but I love watching movies in the original language ( which is Japanese in this case) and it doesn't not support 5.1, only stereo. I compared the 2 sound qualities and it was pretty much day and night. I don't know if this has to do with the deal the company made with the distributors or if it's because most people in japan don't have surround systems in their house, especially Tokyo because of the lack of actual space. Other then that I loved the anime and yet have to finish it.",1519948800,,774,4.344827586206897
