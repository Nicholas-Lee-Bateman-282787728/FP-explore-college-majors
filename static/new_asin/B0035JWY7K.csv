8389077,1,B0035JWY7K,"So I bought this for my dad, and it doesn't even have nickel back music. It is just pics with heavy metal music. What they did was they took the same movie that had horrible reviews and renamed it so then they thought they would get more money for the same thing. Don't waste your money. One movie I would reccomend is nickeback live at home.",1325030400,,342,4.196969696969697
8389078,1,B0035JWY7K,"I pre ordered this dvd thinking that it was an authorized video, because nowhere on this page does it say it is unauthorized, but when I got it today and popped it in, it looked familar. It is the same DVD as ""Nickelback FRAGILE THIS SIDE UP"", which was horrible because music plays all through it and it is not Nickelback and you can't hear when they do show Chad Kroeger speaking cause there is music playing over it. JUST BE AWARE. only worth buying if you are a huge fan and love to see them but it is unauthorized.",1274227200,19,519,4.2
