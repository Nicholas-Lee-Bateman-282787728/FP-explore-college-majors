2828239,2,B000PUAIF2,"I was disappointed in this production. While it had all of the elments needed for a good video, even some humor, it lacked in performance. It was over-acted and cheesy!!! I was hoping for something fun, uplifting, and decently performed. Veggie Tales beats this by a long shot! Turn down the cheese factor and put more solid acting and you might have a decent film.",1332028800,,365,4.630769230769231
2828240,5,B000PUAIF2,"This is a simple production, but that only adds to the enjoyment we get from watching. The song by David and King Saul is amazing and has affected everyone watching.  The children in our family love to watch this over and over.",1193529600,3,227,4.404761904761905
2828241,5,B000PUAIF2,"This is the 2nd Liken DVD I have bought and it's great! This DVD has something to hold the attention of all ages. My husband and I are grandparents in our 60s and this DVD enthralled us as much as our children (ages 25 years to 40 years) and grandchildren (2 years to 15 years old). The music, story, and humor are exceptional! Buy it and you'll love it.",1190246400,3,354,4.144927536231884
2828242,4,B000PUAIF2,These Liken the Scriptures series are great. They aren't quite the quality of the Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. But the songs are cute and my kids really like them. I like that it brings the scriptures to life.,1185494400,2,226,4.675
2828243,5,B000PUAIF2,This is a fantastic production!! Our family has watched it over and over and just love it.  The singing voices are wonderful and the music and songs are amazing!  This is a thoroughly entertaining show for the whole family.  It is both very funny and soul-stirring in all the right places.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful family show!,1416355200,,367,4.6875
2828244,5,B000PUAIF2,My nephew and I loved it,1412812800,,24,3.1666666666666665
2828245,5,B000PUAIF2,"I have watched a lot of movies in the 'Liken Bible Series'. But this one is far and away the very best. The acting is good, but the music is superb. In fact, I bought just the music CD as well. Not a single song I don't enjoy on here. Great mix of fun and thoughtful. Good for all ages.",1412035200,,286,3.783333333333333
2828246,1,B000PUAIF2,"I absolutely love the original version, One Smooth Stone.  I do not like this version at all.  I think the producers went way out of their way to pander to the popular Christian crowd and to be politically correct.  I've got to admit this version really bugs the heck out of me.  I am not racist, but I have to say I have had it with the all-wise councilor black lady persona.  I think that Whoopi Goldberg in Star Trek the Next Generation did me in on that score.  I am sick and tired of the ""lets make the men look stupid and the woman look smart"" thing.",1386806400,,556,4.101851851851852
2828247,5,B000PUAIF2,This is our favorite Liken the Scriptures video.  The songs in here are incredible and David and Kings Sauls voices are amazing.  Our family has watched this video and listened to the songs at least 25 times.  The story of David and Goliath helps apply the Bible Concept of how to overcome your fears to everyday life.  Its a great video.,1386720000,,338,4.491803278688525
2828248,5,B000PUAIF2,This is a fun movie. My grandson loves the story and the singing.  It is a great way to teach stories from the scriptures.,1386720000,,122,4.083333333333333
2828249,2,B000PUAIF2,"I own this DVD and was willing to pay for the digital version for convenience. This is sub-dvd quality. I suppose it would be OK on a tablet or phone but on a tv it is really grainy. This show is great, the music is great. My poor rating is not for the movie but is for the digital copy quality.",1374624000,,295,3.8524590163934427
2828250,5,B000PUAIF2,"This movie series by Likin is in general by far the best in the genre and this particular movie is no exception. The cast are exceptional actors and it really brings a stage-like musical production feel into the comfort of our home. The numerous musical numbers in the movie are witty, fun, and I think greatly add to the passion of the movie, they are also catchy and kids will likely be singing along to them long after the movie is over. This David & Goliath reiteration is more or less fun for all ages, full of humor and yet also serious in that it is mostly inline with scripture references.
Considering the price for this movie here on Amazon.com, there are absolutely no cons I can think of. If the movie was to cost more then $10, I would say a con would be the short length of the movie since it is only 60 minutes run time, which includes credits.",1365724800,,858,4.302469135802469
2828251,5,B000PUAIF2,"This is my favorite of all the ""Liken"" series.  The music and voices are amazing - particularly when King Saul sings, ""I used to be like you are now, so innocent and pure"".  His voice is fantastic! And when David sings, ""One Small Stone"", it just caps the play.  We play those songst over and over again.  Thurl Bailey is a wonderful Goliath. Who knew he could sing?",1356134400,,366,4.338235294117647
2828252,4,B000PUAIF2,"We have enjoyed all of the Liken movies that we've purchased.  This one is fun and entertaining - the singers are very good.  The value of this production is in the authenticity of the script, the quality of the music, and the fun way it is presented.",1350518400,,251,4.319148936170213
8193352,5,B000PUAIF2,Our second DVD copy after the first was lent out and never returned. Beautifully made musical for the family to enjoy.,1525824000,,118,4.666666666666667
8193353,1,B000PUAIF2,Lightstone Studios is mormon.  Be warned.,1523059200,,41,5.833333333333333

8193355,1,B000PUAIF2,"I have spent 37 minutes trying to remove the charge for this movie! I can find nothing allowing me to do this. I looked at title, I did not order. I do not have one click settings. Digital orders shows the movie but there is nothing to get a refund or cancel. It is very upsetting. Worse yet, I had a low balance so this caused a check to bounce at bank. I've tried help, There was info showing cancelling order but was not for digital orders. Gave secondary place for this but I have been unable to find!

I was able to remove the credit card but again, unable to learn how to get this money refunded. I have shopped with Amazon for years...  I will not continue if I do not get this money back.",1494460800,,696,4.072992700729927

8193357,1,B000PUAIF2,"Apparently there are 2 versions of this video. One (the Original), with Spencer having to speak at Stake Conference. This one, NOT the Original, is with the girl and it changes the interjections of the movie. However, since I ""started"" it for all of 1 min, I can't return or cancel. My fault I'm sure, but still lame.",1484438400,,317,4.482758620689655
8193358,4,B000PUAIF2,Our family enjoys watching this movie together. My boys especially enjoy the fight scene song.,1462320000,,94,5.333333333333333
8193359,4,B000PUAIF2,"Wonderful biblical musical.  King Saul, way funny!  Give it a chance you might just like it.",1458000000,,92,4.6875
8193360,5,B000PUAIF2,Great movie. Inspires kids to stand up for themselves and each other.,1434844800,,69,4.833333333333333
8193361,5,B000PUAIF2,This is an excellent musical.  I have 9 children and we all loved it.  There are great songs and it is well produced.  I applaud those who took the time to produce these videos.  It is sorely needed.  I pray we have more great quality family plays and films like this one and the others produced as well.,1417132800,,304,4.172413793103448
