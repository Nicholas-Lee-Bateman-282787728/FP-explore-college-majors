2409136,3,B000B8QFXC,"Out of the whole S.P.D. series, I must say that Volumes 3 and 4 run a tie for the best. In volume 5, the powers rangers seem to have weakened a bit. When Grumm finally turns Morgana into her adult self, she is determined to become a child again, but she has to defeat the power rangers first. So she gets morphed up and seems to be able to take on all of them by herself. The power rangers seem to be taking one beating after another. Even Cruger is geetting his tail kicked.

And then comes Omega. He is actually a ranger sent from the future to help them out. If you have seen Vol 2 he was Sam, the boy who could make stuff disappear. He was also the little sparkly ball in Volume 4 that took out all the Krybots in ""Perspective"". Anyway, he is incredible, with all kinds of powers that they don't have. He is also a little arrogant, and has his own hero complex. Of course since his is the new guy, and can kick [...] the others, especially Sky, are jealous.

There are five episodes: ""Messenger"" Parts I and II, ""Zapped"" and ""Reflection"" parts I and II. The messenger episodes deal with the arrival of Omega on the scene who saves the day and then the other rangers get to help him out. He basically told them to stay out of his way with their outdated equipment which ticks them all off. Morgana enlists the help of two new creatures. ""Shorty"" and His brother ""Devastation"" who are hard to beat, not including her. In Zapped, Morgana enlists the help of a crooked magician to help her take down the PR, but is foiled again by omega and the others. The rangers get into trouble for disobeying Cruger and going on a stakeout that was assigned to omega. ""Reflections focuses on Sky a little more. We find out why he wanted to be the red ranger so badly: His Father was a red ranger. For some reason, a bunch of theives that they have already battled seem to keep popping up, but they are still contained. Cruger sends Sky to question a criminal mastermind who is able to travel through any reflection. The criminal keys Sky in on who the real criminal is, and in exchange Sky must tell him his saddest memory. Sky tells him about his father who was killed in battle. When he starts crying, one of his tears hit the floor and the criminal is able to escape. Cruger left out an important factor about the criminal: he is the one responsible for killing Sky's father. Meanwhile, Jack has some new equipment that turns him into this ultimate unstoppable warrior that he lets Sky borrow to take the criminal down. If you saw the bonus episode ""Wormhole"" on vol 4 the you have seen this stuff. There was also a totally lame part about Piggy pledging his allegience to Grumm, he was been helping both sides and Grumm forces him to choose. Grumms new plans sort of leave you hanging. Like I said, not as good as the others, but a must have in the collection",1152489600,2,2851,4.317164179104478
8083729,3,B000B8QFXC,It wasn't as entertaining as the other volumes. I also thought that it was going to cover all the rest of the episodes but it ended up not doing so and there is still a couple of episodes left.,1466899200,,193,3.9743589743589745

8083732,5,B000B8QFXC,"this is a pretty good dvd and u get 6 episodes total. this was the perfect dvd for me cuz i wanted one that had all 7 rangers. it shows the arrival  of the omega ranger, adult Morgana and the battlizer. plus a bonus ep of the 2nd dino thunder/spd team up. so don't listen to all those other reviews that say its not worth it, cuz it totally is.",1412640000,,344,3.914285714285714
8083733,5,B000B8QFXC,"I grew up with SPD, and I believe it is a must have for any PR fans out there. You won't be disappointed, but if you are expecting the individual DVDs Disney released to be the entire series, then this might slow you down. But if you're not looking for the new DVDs that were released not long ago, then you'll enjoy this DVD.",1390608000,,326,4.109375
8083734,4,B000B8QFXC,"sure its not an episode list, and the dvd set just shows the gist, at least they get the meat in there. still bummed they left a few episodes out",1362182400,,145,3.8666666666666667
8083735,4,B000B8QFXC,it was nice pitty you can't  get the all the movies but it is nice and i enjoyed it is fun,1359936000,,90,3.2857142857142856
8083736,1,B000B8QFXC,The company sent use the wrong Power Rangers video.  Sent us Vol. 1  in a volume 5 case.  Not happy with this.  .Boo!,1357084800,,117,3.9565217391304346
8083737,1,B000B8QFXC,"Pay 50-$120.00 for one dvd with only one episode ( run time : 22 minutes ) and 5 minutes of the same bonus features . Yah , if people are stupid or love waisting money when everyone could use it towards buying a game system ( P.S.3 , X-BOX 360 or Wii U ) . These SPD DVDs are short enough to be combined into one whole dvd . Who ever thought making power rangers spd volumes 1 to 5 this short was a freaking idiot .",1346025600,,415,3.781609195402299
8083738,1,B000B8QFXC,"WARNING. If you buy this volume (along with Volumes 1-4) expecting to get the full series, you will be cheated. The series run for 38 episodes and this volume only gets you to episode 25, leaving 13 unreleased episodes and thus no closure or way of seeing how the series ended. I am giving it one star due to the stopping the releases only 66% into the run.

All of the Power Ranger DVD releases seem to follow this partial release pattern.",1309219200,,440,4.365853658536586
