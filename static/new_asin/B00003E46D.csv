Look for any real version or the book, but not this tripe.

For those of you who may have missed the story King Rudolf V, who is not the nicest of people, is drugged out of the way. Because all Kings named Rudolf look like Stewart Granger, a vacationing Englishman, who happens to be a long lost cousin, he gets to substitute for the stability of the country and to foil the bad guys (his half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Robert Douglas) form taking over.

Apart from this version.  I don't know or care where it's from.  All you need to know is that they took ""creative license"" and now our twins are not interested in the same woman.
