2889824,4,B000SSONHK,"MASCOT PICTURES made serials under its own name from 1926 to 1935. After that, MASCOT and four other lesser ""Poverty Row"" studios were combined under the REPUBLIC PICTURES banner.

THE LONE DEFENDER (1930) was the first full-sound MASCOT serial (1929's ""The King of the Kongo"" had a partial soundtrack). Rin Tin Tin was under previous contract to WARNER's, but they didn't think animal movies would do well in the sound era- a serious misjudgement in retrospect.

THE STORY:
A prospector is murdered by a gang. His dog Rinty sees this crime. Knowing the dog might lead them to the prospector's mine, the gang pursues the unfortunate animal. Help comes however from an unlikely source: an undercover government agent.

CAST:
Rin Tin Tin - Rinty
Walter Miller - Marco Roberto (the ""Mysterious Figure,"" Ramon)
June Marlowe - Dolores Valdez (prospector's daughter)
Josef Swickard - Juan Valdez (prospector)
Buzz Barton - Buzz (Ramon's sidekick)
Lee Shumway - Amos Harkey (""The Cactus Kid"")
Julia Bejarano - Maria (the Duea)
Lafe McKee - Sheriff Billings

LONE DEFENDER trivia:

Listed at imdb as an ""actor,"" Rin Tin Tin was born in Lorraine, France in 1918. Discovered at a bombed-out shelter during WWI, the lucky pup eventually made it to America, then Hollywood, after being ""discovered"" at an L.A. dog show by Darryl Zanuck (Rinty amazed crowds there by jumping 13 feet). He made his first movie in 1922, and had a long and successful career. Rin Tin Tin died at age 14 in 1932-- his remains were returned to France. His descendants continue to flourish today.

Stuntman Joe Bonomo (son of the creator of ""Bonomo's Turkish Taffy) is best remembered as stunt-double for Lon Chaney in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" Bonomo's  precipitous rope-slide in that silent film is quite an amazing feat.

In his 50-year film career, Lee Shumway (""The Cactus Kid"") appeared in over 400 movies.

8206565,4,B000SSONHK,"I agree with the reviewer that said the Mill Creek version of this serial  is of poor quality.  Alpha is a little better, but the Grapevine Video DVD version is much better as a picture and is worth a few dollars more to enjoy  Rin Tin Tin Jr. in this early serial.",1429228800,,265,4.0576923076923075

8206568,2,B000SSONHK,"After attempting to watch the Mill Creek version of ""The Lone Defender,"" a landmark, action-packed 1930 Rin-Tin-Tin serial, I gave up. The reasons being that the Mill Creek version had horrible picture quality and even worse sound. The sound is so muffled that it is almost impossible to understand any of the dialogue.

So I bought the Alpha version and hoped for the best. Well, the ""best"" is not what I got. The Alpha version of this serial is a little better than the Mill Creek version, but not much. The picture is a little clearer and the sound is better for the most part. The dialogue in the Alpha version is usually submerged in a sea of hiss, but most of it can be understood without too much of a strain.

So when it comes to grading these two DVD versions, I would have to give Mill Creek an ""F"" and Alpha a ""D+.""

This is too bad considering that ""The Lone Defender"" is the first all-talking serial in film history. And it stars the original Rin-Tin-Tin only two years before his death. Rinty was quite an actor... much better than some of his human counterparts. And the beautiful June Marlowe (who played Miss Crabtree in a few of the early Our Gang talkies) also makes this serial worth the price of admission.

I hope that there is a company somewhere that will give this wonderful serial the star treatment it deserves for a future DVD release.",1328659200,7,1363,4.483870967741935
