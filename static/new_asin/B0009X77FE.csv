I used to watch it when I was younger, and, for some reason, it stuck with me all the way up until now (I'm twenty years old). I always remembered the kangaroo, but I never could remember the name of this show. Can't believe I can watch this again, and still remember it.",1455235200,2,350,4.161764705882353
8069129,5,B0009X77FE,"We've been watching this movie at my daycare for years and years - it's a childcare center legend. Now don't get me wrong, this movie is strange. There is that weird kangaroo, the bus drives itself, Bitsy is a runaway and never gets chastised for it, all the kids revel in the fact that the bully gets poison ivy and so on. It doesn't matter how odd I think this movie is, I can't deny the fact that the kids love it. It is one of the only movies that my toddler class will sit and watch quietly. They won't watch Barney, Dora, Blues Clues or Sesame Street but they love this silly 90's movie about the crazy talking bus. Things I've noticed during my years in childcare regarding movies: toddlers prefer real people to animation, they love anything with music, they love the song ""The Wheels on the Bus"" and they love animals. This movie has all of these things. So, claim it's cheesy and poorly acted but it's not made for adults; it's made for children. And if the kids love this crazy movie, then I like it too!",1419292800,2,1015,4.319371727748691
8069130,1,B0009X77FE,"This DVD is creepy and asinine. And, for those expecting the song The Wheels on the Bus a disappointment. Save your time and money and skip this one.",1255564800,,149,4.357142857142857
8069131,4,B0009X77FE,"My son loves the Wheels on the Bus song, and that's why I purchased this DVD.  It's not great, but he is fimiliar with all the songs and he likes to watch the DVD. My only complaint is that the DVD is only 30 minutes...",1139616000,2,219,3.8666666666666667
