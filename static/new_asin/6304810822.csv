7877663,2,6304810822,"I saw this movie years ago, and being your typical arm chair treasure hunter, was glad to see it was available on DVD. I remembered how the movie caught the overall
perseverance, dedication and meager existence of a team of dreamers that had them saying ""Today's the day!"" every time they went out in search of the Atocha. Loaded with gold and silver, the Spanish ship sank in a storm somewhere off the Florida Keys in 1622. The crew worked for 16 years before seeing any kind of pay day. It's a great story. However, the rich turquoise waters and scenes of beautiful beaches of Key West were all washed out and almost void of color. The whole movie looked like it was shot at the wrong exposure. I was very disappointed with the quality of color having seen it before back in the 80's on TV in rich vibrant color. I give this movie
a low rating not because of the movie itself, but because the DVD transfer process used washed out so much of it's color.",1305417600,2,954,4.365168539325842
7877664,5,6304810822,I have always been a fan of the late Mel Fischer. This is a video of the TV movie made in the '80's (I believe). Decent quality for the time it was made. I enjoyed it-worth the price.,1286755200,,183,3.8421052631578947
7877665,5,6304810822,"i read the book about mel fisher called ""TREASURE"" when i was a boy. this year, i ordered the discovery channel's video, and this one:""DREAMS OF GOLD"" to add to my video collection. the discovery channel's coverage was kind of stale and factual, but i was surprised by the ""DREAMS OF GOLD"" video. it made the characters come to life much more, and portrayed them like the real people they are.true stories are always best in my opinion, and often stranger then fiction. another good treasure hunting story to read is ""SHIP OF GOLD IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA"" by gary kinder. i found this one in a dollar store and i couldn't put it down. it's the story of the search for the wreck of the ""central america""",1277596800,3,699,4.426356589147287
