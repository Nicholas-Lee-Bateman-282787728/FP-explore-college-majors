8624084,3,B00GKI43D6,"I would have to think that Neil Young did not endorse this video, given his obsession with sound quality. The volume surges up and down, the aspect ratio is off, giving his guitar an elongated look and making Neil look short and stocky. Having said that, I would buy this movie again in an instant because in my biased opinion any footage of Neil Young in concert is worth having. Although this was shot a few years back, the setlist has a lot of the same songs he played on his 2014 'Honor the Treaties' tour, or the Carnegie Hall concerts. If you are a Neil Young fanatic, you have to have this. A more casual fan would be better advised to get either the 'Heart of Gold' or 'Weld' DVD, depending on your preference for the acoustic or hard-rocking version respectively.",1402704000,11,772,4.443661971830986
