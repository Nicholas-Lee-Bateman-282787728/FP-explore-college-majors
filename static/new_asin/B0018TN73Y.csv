8271122,3,B0018TN73Y,"I ordered this thinking I would be getting a complete set, but I should have checked more closely at the Product Details section and IMDb. I had changed my mind ordering this a few times before committing to it, because there are so many other DVD collections to choose from with all kinds of mixed reviews and prices. I spent time trying to figure out which set might have the original theme music (sadly, this one does not), reviewing a good Wikipedia article on it, but forgot to see if this actually did include the entire series or not.

Ho ho!  No.

This set comes with 4 discs. There is 1 disc per volume(case). Each disc has 10 episodes on it.  Per IMDb, this series went on for 9 seasons. The first season alone had 36 episodes. Since this is not listed any where else, I've decided to break down a list for you, so you'll know which episodes are actually on these discs. Listed below are each of the 10 episodes on each of the 4 discs, listed with the actual corresponding season and episode number, per www.imdb.com.

These discs contain most of season 1 and a handful of season 2 episodes, completely out of sequence. I'm not sure what the reasoning for this jumble is, or why some episodes from season 1 are left out. I haven't yet found an alternative, comprehensive collection that includes every episode of all 9 seasons. I guess this is decent for it's price, even if it bothers my sense of completion (""my OCD sense is tingling!""). This just needs a better product description on Amazon.

On the bright side, this series doesn't have to be watched in sequence, but I would have liked to see it's progression as it was originally aired. Also, beyond the limited (40) cherry-picked episodes and the forlorned absence of the original theme song, the quality of each episode is impeccable...or what you'd expect for an old black and white series from 1961.  :P
