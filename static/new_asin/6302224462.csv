438851,5,6302224462,"This fact based WW2 film is one of the great whip 'em into shape movies. When the call went out for U.S. and Canadian volunteers for a commando unit many commanders used this as a oppurtunity to unload their trouble makers. Choir boys don't make good commandos so the right men were available for the job. This film shows the tough training that these men endured including skiing, mountain warfare and advanced hand to hand combat. I've read a few books on these men and the film accurately potrays the bonding developed between the US and Canadians as they teamed up in the local bars to fight lumberjacks and miners. After their harsh training the force is sent to Italy. The film makes no mention that the force's first mission was against the Japanese in the Aluetion Islands. The climax of the film is an assault on a mountain top in Italy. These scences are so well done that when I attended the USMC mountain warfare school at Bridgeport CA. they used this clip as a training tool. The film has a great soundtrack and lots of hero type actors. Just one problem-where did those red berets come from? Read the 2001 published book, ""The Black Devil Brigade"" told by the men themselves.",1007424000,82,1190,4.591549295774648

Being an extra in this film gave me the opportunity to talk with men who actually served in the ""Devil's  Brigade"".  They gave valuable assistance in contributing to the film's  accuracy.  After viewing the film, you may want to read about their further  exploits that the film couldn't depict.  There is a fine book of the same  title that is, unfortunately, out of print.

The men that were used for extras were actual soldiers. I feel that this movie told a story  about war and about the people that fought it. There wasn't all the blood  and guts like you have in todays movies. I am proud of this film and its an  experience everyone should be able to experience.

438901,5,6302224462,"It is the height of the Second World War. Someone decided it was time to have a Joint Readiness Brigade. Many did not want to see it succeed so it was t consist of the bottom of the barrel US troops and crack Canadian troops. Naturedly to head this up was Lt. Col. Robert T. Frederick (William Holden), Maj. Alan Crown (Cliff Robertson), and Maj. Cliff Bricker (Vince Edwards).

The film is formula (a ""Dirty Dozen"" knockoff) where they must give a rag tag motley crew the incentive to become a cohesive fighting machine will a will to win in unorthodox ways. In the process they will become Die Teufelsbrigade or The Devil's Brigade.

438936,5,6302224462,I really liked it. Better than I remembered it back in late 60's when I saw it while I was in the service. It is sort of Dirty Dozen lite but with less emphasis on training and more on mission. I thought the interplay between the Canadians and the Americans to be entertaining with a nice coming together free for all when the two contingents were put upon by some loggers toward the end of training. I'd recommend for WWII action movie fans of which I am one. And BluRay  print was fine!,1503360000,2,488,4.247311827956989

438938,3,6302224462,"I watched this as a bright eyed kid and bought it just for that reason. It was good for  60's movie. I hated the partayal of the Americans as brigands though. I know it was trying to be a cheap Dirty Dozen or Kelly's Hero's but it didn't work and made our boys look bad. The real story is they were western adventurers, loggers, sheriff's and other assorted tough men that don't exist today.

I wish they would remake the movie and include the real story of the joint special operations group would be told. The campaign to retake the Aleutian islands would be marvelous since most Americans never knew the Japanese took US territory off the coast of Alaska.

The entrance of the Canadians is worth the price of the movie in my mind. Just a great and rousing scene.",1502150400,2,765,4.411347517730497

439049,5,6302224462,"As far as the movie goes, my favorite character was Pvt. Hugh MacDonald, portrayed by Dickie Dawson. I loved his wicked sense of humor and his absolute sense of loyalty. The rest of the cast was superb as well. There are so many moments from the movie that stick in my mind: the awesome arrival of the Canadians was so awe-inspiring. The brawl in the bar, and Col. Fredericks reaction was priceless! Other moments:  the race between Hugh and Greco, Graduation...!  Henri's kind eyes in the med shack, Ransom's ""baptism by fire."" and Crown...They don't make movies, or actors, like these anymore...

What amazed me in my research about the Brigade was that the DAY AFTER their costly victory at Monte La Defensia, the Brigade immediately engaged the Germans in another hard-fought three-day campaign at another hill, and took that hill from the Germans as well. In a unit of a total of 1800 men, they sustained an attrition rate of 600%... in ONE battle (apparently La Defensia)  they suffered a casualty rate of 71%. Yet, as Col. Fredericks says at the end of the movie, what is absolutely true is that they NEVER surrendered  one inch of ground! They NEVER retreated. And WE must NEVER forget.",1473638400,3,1194,4.748792270531401

In an interview with the men that went through the original training that took place during the war, they did what had to be done.  Many saw the Nazi as the ultimate evil that had to be destroyed at any cost.  Others choose to not think about that time of killing and loss.  In the end most of the men came through the experience knowing that they had made a difference in a terrible war that none of them wanted to be fighting but did because it had to be done.",1471910400,4,621,4.15

Idiotic film that portrays a bunch of drunk losers who brawl, that suddenly become one of the best army units in WW2.  The incessant brawling takes 2 hours of time.  It is tedious and juvenile.

William Holden is as stiff as ever in his role as some tough commander who's always at the front of the battle, without taking an injury I might add.

You might want to throw away your brain once the actual battles start up, since the Wehrmacht is portrayed as a bunch of idiots who don't know how to fight or stand guard duty.  The greenhorn US grunts walk down a stream and take the whole town just like that.

There is also no way a bunch of greenhorn US grunts are going to capture a town that was probably supported by Gebirgsjger (Mountain units) and Waffen SS Mountain units by simply and easily climbing up a steep hill without gloves or equipment.

There is also no way a bunch of greenhorn US grunts are going to capture a hill held by seasoned Fallschirmjger units (paratrooper).",1459555200,,1027,4.454545454545454

439272,4,6302224462,"I was only partially satisfied with this film, even if I rather enjoyed watching it. It could have been a much better thing, if the director made into an original thing, rather than trying hard to make another ""Dirty Dozen"" - which obviously was an impossible task. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

This film is based on the true story of First Special Service Force, indeed sometimes nicknamed ""Devil's Brigade"", a mixed American-Canadian commando created in 1942 and which, after participating in the Aleutian Islands campaign (landing on Kiska in 1943), fought with distinction in 1943 and 1944 in Italy and southern France. It was disbanded on 5 December 1944 near Menton (France). This unit is being considered as the direct ancestor of modern US and Canadian Special Forces, which both celebrate Menton Day every 5 December, by a combined parachute jump and a ball.

This film describes only the first part of this history, beginning with the recruitement and ending at the Monte La Difensa fight on 2 December 1943, which was indeed the greatest exploit of ""Devil's Brigade"" (the unopposed Kiska landing during Aleutian Campaign was however completely skipped, to streamline the narration).

The film has many merits, beginning with good actors (William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Richard Jaeckel and a cameo by Dana Andrews), a quite honest final battle sequence, some good humour and some not half bad dialogs. It has however also one HUGE weakness - it tries to be a remake of ""Dirty Dozen"", which not only is impossible (there will never be another ""Dirty Dozen"", not even in a thousand years) but it also falsifies real history. In this film the American component of the unit is made of the scum of the earth, the worse elements everybody was happy to get rid off once the commando starts recruiting - in fact they are even brought to the training camp under the guard of MPs, in cattle wagons! That is absolutely NOT how it was in reality - all American members of the commando without exception were volunteers and a great number of applicants were rejected, because they didn't fit the very demanding profile necessary to serve in the unit.

Also, the film really follows the general line of events in ""Dirty Dozen"": difficult and forced recruitement, efforts to unify the initially very divided group by offering them a common enemy, hostility of some high ranking @holes, a first mission which is in fact a repetition of the already legendary maneuvres scenes from ""Dirty Dozen"" and finally the real battle. It is really like watching a remake of a much better film, which was incidentally made only one year earlier...

Let's stress it again - I am not saying that this is a bad film, no, in fact I rather enjoyed watching it. But this is not really a faithful description of real ""Devil's Brigade"" and it could have been a much better thing, if Andrew V. McLaglen didn't try so hard to step in Robert Aldrich's much wider and deeper tracks. Still, a rather honest thing, for which the ideal rating would probably be 3,5 stars. ENJOY!",1443139200,,3078,4.8330170777988615

The 1800-man force captured over 7,000 prisoners, inflicted 12,000 German casualties and had a 600% attrition rate. The 'featured' battle in the film resulted in something like 77% casualties for the force.

The American misfits at first don't take kindly to the polished Canadians, but as time goes on they find some common ground. The film contains too many clumsy and cluttered battle scenes, but the energetic personalities of the cast helps offset this somewhat. The underdog status of the brigade and their progress carries the plot well and strengthens the quality of the movie.

439596,2,6302224462,"At least I was busy putting up the houses that would go around the base of the Christmas tree when this movie provided ample noise background which was better than quiet--I suppose.

The movie is based on the much better book, as is usually the case. The film is bland, formula-ridden, with mediocre acting and miscasting that characterized this boring and unusually long film. I was saved by the frequent commercials showing Santa trying to get me to buy a Chevrolet. William Holden played the real-life Lt. Col. Frederick who later became a major-general in the army before retiring. The real life guy looked younger than Holden, was skinny with a pencil-thin mustache. Cliff Roberston played an Irish Canadian with a brooding air and an unconvincing brogue. Vince Edwards should have stuck to playing Dr. Ben Casey. Claude Aiken and Richard Jaekel are the usual suspects called upon to military roles.

By formula ridden I mean every major character is paired up with someone they initially despise and end up becoming friends. One of each pair always dies by the end of the film. There also seems to be more Thompson submachine guns in this brigade then in the entire European Theater. They all seem to be capable of shooting from the hip and each Thompson has an endless supply of bullets without changing magazines. ""Give'em hell!"" ""Let's go!"" ""Come on!"" are thrilling, novel parts of the script too. Naturally,  the Germans have to lose every hand-to-hand combat encounter.

Now for the mistakes which annoy me no end in military movies. It's kind of like watching someone's napkin sitting precariously on someone's knee wondering if they will find it before it falls to the floor. The Devil's Brigade was made up of a contingent from the U.S. Army, most ""volunteers"" from various stockades around the country, and a Canadian contingent which sent their very best. So during their ""pass in review"" we see the American flag, the Union Jack and Brigade's flag. Whoah! Rewind! The Union Jack? The Canadian flag at the time had a Union Jack in the upper left corner flanked by blue field with a crest on the blue, eh?. Where was that flag, eh? How can you build expensive sets and not pay for the right flag, eh?

This deserves two buckets of coal.

439601,5,6302224462,"This great World War II movie of 1968 stars William Holden and Cliff Robertson as the leaders of a joint U.S.-Canadian brigade of soldiers who at first really do NOT like each other.  It is about how a brigade of some tough and trouble G.I.'s with a few soldier convicts are turned into an elite fighting brigade along with top notch Canadian soldiers who are not impressed with the U.S. Army's ""elite"" group of men.  The first half of the movie is funny with the two groups trying to hurt and sabotage each other in training.  However, after getting into a big bar fight with the local men in town, they start to have respect for each other.  The men are sent in combat, albeit begrudgedly by superiors who don't believe they can do good in combat.  In order to prove the superiors wrong, Holden makes a challenge that the brigade can capture an entire brigade of German Soldiers without a casualty.  He wins the bet as the brigade captures an entire German brigade without a single wound or casualty.
Then he volunteers them for a perilous attack on a Nazi stronghold in the mountains. His men will be outnumbered and outgunned, but that's a fair fight to ""the devil's brigade."" The men suffer many casualties but capture the Nazi stronghold.
This is a good movie for those who enjoy combat Hollywood World War II Movies.  This is a lot like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and a bit like ""Kelly's Heroes"", so you know it is enjoyed by those who like combat movies.  A good movie!",1384041600,,1468,4.513207547169811
439602,4,6302224462,"""The Devil's Brigade"" was released in 1968, 11 months after the hugely successful ""The Dirty Dozen"". Both films have similar plots and were based on real-life WWII units -- ""The Dirty Dozen"" was loosely based on the Filthy Thirteen and ""The Devil's Brigade"" more tightly based on the 1st Special Service Force, AKA The Black Devils.

Their plots are similar in that they each involve a group of military delinquents being trained for a big mission and then the execution of that mission. They differ in that the 1st Special Service Force was comprised of both American and Canadian soldiers, rather than just Americans.

Although ""The Devil's Brigade"" is based more on fact it's still a very Hollywood-ized depiction of events. For instance, actual members of the unit objected to the way the film limits the groups warm relations with the locals of Helena, Montana, (the city nearest their training base) to a major brouhaha in a saloon.

The first half of the film takes place mostly at the dilapidated base near Helena, but was shot at a base in Lehi, Utah, which is a decent substitute since it's only 350 miles due south of Helena.

Generally speaking, ""The Devil's Brigade"" is not as good as ""The Dirty Dozen"", but that's only because the latter film is so great, plus it came first. Yet it has some aspects that are just as good in their own way and sometimes better. For instance, the final mission in ""The Dirty Dozen"" involves the unit's raid on an opulent German chteau, which -- while good -- is hardly a typical WWII combat scenario; the final mission shown in ""The Devil's Brigade"", by contrast, involves the brigade's taking of a German stronghold atop a rocky mountain in Northern Italy, an excellent battle sequence.

Although it's next to impossible to beat Lee Marvin as the commander of the unit in ""The Dirty Dozen"", William Holden is very strong in the counterpart role in ""The Devil's Brigade"". However, he was too long-in-the-tooth for the part as the real commander of The Black Devils was much younger, but that's not a big deal.

Despite the above criticisms of the saloon brawl, it is a highlight, as is the scene in the mess hall where a hand-to-hand combat trainer is introduced. It's an extremely well-staged sequence.

Claude Akins is great as the ape-like Pvt. Rockman, but his hysterics at the death of his Canadian comrade in battle is overly melodramatic. As if he wasn't prepared for the likely death of a fellow soldier in battle.

FINAL SAY: If you're in the mood for a late 60s war flick in the mode of ""The Dirty Dozen"", ""The Devil's Brigade"" is a quality option.

The film runs 130 minutes and was shot in Utah & Italy.

This is a movie inspired by the story of a real unit in WWII made up of American and Canadian soldiers. The story is nothing special but it is well done and the stars hold it together well.

439730,5,6302224462,"THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE has been around for some time now and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre on its initial release. Through the years I came to love this film and realized it is truly one of the best war films ever made. Yet, more importantly it is just a great film given any genre. As the film unfolded I thought it was going to be another rehashing of the DIRTY DOZEN formula, but of that I was wrong. The DIRTY DOZEN is one of the all-time classic and innovative war films ever made where a band of misfits is tossed together and honed into a crack fighting unit during WWII. THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE based on some factual events, similarly takes American misfits and brings in a crack battle hardened unit of Canadian infantry and ultimately forms a ""special forces"" brigade. At the heart of both films is the training and the camaraderie that builds between these men tossed together in the extraordinary circumstances of war. Director Robert Aldrich's handling of the DIRTY DOZEN is very successful and his style of camaraderie seems rather blunt and brutal at times, but yet he built a cohesive unit to accomplish the mission. In THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE director Andrew V. McLaglen takes the John Ford approach. His scenes and direction of building and honing a cohesive and effective unit of fighting men, building that important element of camaraderie, are both bawdy and sentimental.  Andrew V. McLaglen and his father had a long working association with John Ford and you see that visually on the screen in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE. For me, this a more endearing approach. During times of war men are tossed together from many backgrounds and are called upon to serve their country and those of their allies under such uncommon circumstances from ordinary daily life testing their will and fortitude to get the job done. Andrew V. McLaglen captures that spirit in THE DEVIL'S BRIGADE.

In the film the American contingent are initially seen at odds with their Canadian counterpart. William Holden seems somewhat cold and distant as he takes up the task to mold this diverse group of men into a singular brigade that will perform with courage and valor in the field. He plays the well-disciplined Canadian unit up against the motley undisciplined ragtag group of American misfits and loners for the sole purpose of congealing and forming a cohesive spirit among the American contingent so they ultimately think as one and become one and have a common purpose to outshine the Canadians. When Holden finally lets both contingents go into town, it is there that both the Americans and Canadians finally meld into what will ultimately be the brigade as they unwittingly join forces in a brawl to end all brawls against a gang of lumberjacks at the local saloon. You know what? They just don't write scripts like this anymore. There is no cynicism here, no cinematic nonsense acknowledging the presence of some higher ideological military code of honor. These are just ordinary guys who will party hard, fight to the death and get the job done. The way they talk, walk, move and act tells us all we need to know about them.

When they finally put those red berets on and finally assemble on the parade ground as one unit, one brigade, you can't help but get a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye. There is so much more I can say about this film. Just see it for yourself. My dad served in WWII and The Korean War. We both loved this movie and watched it together so many times. I still think of images of Claude Akins and Jack Watson at odds and then the friendship they developed, Richard Jaeckel and his acrobatic feats, Andrew Prine earning his way through blood and guts and many other images too numerous to mention. I have lost focus of what I wanted to say, but I am thankful for this film in more ways than one.

439768,5,6302224462,"The Devils Brigade has always had a bad rap against it.  Released in the summer of 1968, almost exactly one year later than The Dirty Dozen which was released in the summer of '67, The Devils Brigade has always been dismissed as a Dirty Dozen ripoff (the similarity of the titles certainly didn't help.)  This is a shame since I've always considered The Devils Brigade to be a better and more exciting film.
Firstly, The Devils Brigade has always had some truth behind it.  There really was a First Special Service Force, led by a real Col. Robert T. Frederick (ably portrayed by William Holden in the film.)  While I'm sure the Americans in real life weren't quite the goofoffs as seen in this film (any more than the real Black Sheep Squadron were the screw-ups as portrayed in the Robert Conrad TV series.)  Still the teaming of the spit and polish Canadians and the less than spit and polish Americans and their subsequent training is very enjoyable to watch.
The cast led by the always-excellent Holden and Cliff Robertson as the Canadian leader is excellent with great support from Vince Edwards, Claude Akins, Andrew Prine, Richard Jaeckel, Richard Dawson and guest stars Carroll O'Connor and Michael Rennie, well cast as General Mark Clark.
The film was directed by action vet Andrew J. MacLaglen. It features 2 major excellent action sequences.  First the quiet capture of a German-held Italian town by the brigade, without firing a shot.  The second major sequence is the conclusion wherein the brigade scales a mountain to get behind and obtain the high ground on the Germans, who have their artillery trained in the opposite direction.  This major action sequence is terrific.  The excellent music score and terrific theme music, (one of my faves,) is by legendary music composer Alex North (the composer of the score from Spartacus, another one of my favorite movie scores.)
The DVD like many MGM/UA DVDs features no extras but the trailer.  This film like so many others cries out for a retrospective.  (The director of the film and several of the cast members like Robertson, Dawson and Andrew Prine are still around.)
In conclusion, this is a terrific large-scale war film that has for years been unfairly criticised.  If you haven't seen it and enjoy this type of film, I suggest you do not read any reviews (except this one, of course) and see for yourself.",1242518400,5,2375,4.822660098522167

Funny how this movie took a backseat to the entirely fictional Dirty Dozen when it is about a real US-Canadian commando group that actually fought in the war.  This movie was a better war movie than Dirty Dozen.

That said, a check with books about the First Special Service Force will show you that most of the characters in the movie were fictional (with the exception of Col. Frederick and Sgt. O'Neill, the hand to hand combat instructor).  And the attack on the town, where they capture an entire panzer regiment?  Never happened.  Not according to what I've read.

The attack on Mount Difensa DID happen and this part of the movie is excellent and an exciting climax.  But that was just the start for the Devil's Brigade.  They fought up the Italian boot, held a third of the line at Anzio, and ended up in southern France before being disbanded.  None of this makes it into the movie.

Fine performances by William Holden as Frederick and Cliff Robertson as the fictional Major Crown.  Carroll O'Conner does an early version of his Archie Bunker character as a fictional major general.  And Richard Dawson wears a kilt before doing his Corporal Newkirk character on Hogan's Heroes.  This stuff alone makes this war movie worth a watch.

Ok, now for the fun facts, that are sports related.  If any of you are Green Bay Packer fans, you will notice that one of the lumberjacks in the bar fight scene was played by none other than the Golden Boy, Paul Hornung!  I do not think that Paul received any academy awards for his short role!
Also, Richard Jaekel was also in the Dirty Dozen, which the film has been compared to, and unfairly at that!  Richard's son was also a top flight pro golfer and played on the PGA tour for many years!",1189296000,,769,4.134228187919463
439814,4,6302224462,"If you like vintage WWII action movies like The Dirty Dozen you will enjoy the Devil's Brigade. It tells the story of a commando type unit that fights in Italy. The story is pretty simple - a unit comprised of American misfits with Canadian hardcore soliders prepares for combat in Norway. William Holden is well cast as the unit's commander, and he does a solid job of keeping the story moving along.

The action scenes are well done, and the last assault on the German stronghold is pretty gripping. Although The Devil's Brigade does not have as many memorable lines as The Dirty Dozen, or as many stars as The Longest Day, it is still worth viewing if you enjoy vintage WWII movies.",1188604800,,685,4.569105691056911
439815,4,6302224462,"I've seen this movie several times over the years and consider it a very good film with solid acting.  For the most part it is historically accurate, but much of the real story has been omitted.  One former ""Forceman"" I met did not like the film because of the way it portrayed the characters as brawling misfits and lovers.  Several of the characters in it were real people, including COL (later LT GEN) Frederick, SGT MAJOR O'Neill, and GEN Mark Clark.  To learn more about the history of this unit I recommend you read the book of the same title.  You will discover much more to the story than a movie has time to capture, such as an ""odd"" Englishman named Pike who conceived the idea, and the chaos of their first operational mission conducted against what was thought to be a Japanese held island.  If you are ever in Montana, I also strongly encourage you to visit the Montana Military History Museum in Helena.  Among other things, the museum has articles on display from the First Special Service Force.  When I visited it two years ago I was privileged to meet one of the original members who helped establish the unit and lead a company of ""Forcemen"" through all their campaigns.  His personal adventure alone would make for a long movie.  Note, this was the only Army unit in WWII history to earn battle streamers for service against the Japanese (Aleutian campaign), Italians, and Germans (Italy and France).  It also was the only unit at that time simultaneously trained for airborne, mountain, and amphibious operations.",1172620800,3,1534,4.7293233082706765

439818,3,6302224462,"""The Devil's Brigade"" was a transparent rip off of the classic film ""The Dirty Dozen"" and paled by comparison.  The plots were similar in that a group of miscreants had to be whipped into an effective fighting force.  As is typical for these types of films there was an impressive cast lead by a disappointing and seemingly uninspired William Holden playing Col. Robert Frederick.  Holden, terrific in countless other war flicks was off his mark in this one.

Holden had to mold a combination of crack Canadian troops lead by spit and polish Maj. Crown played by Cliff Robertson and a rag tag bunch of Americans lead by Maj. Bricker played by cigar chomping Vince Edwards.  The parallels between this flick and Dirty Dozen were all too familiar as the troops, initially at odds with each other banded together to form a cohesive fighting unit.

As in DD, the higher ups had doubts about the fitness of Holden's guys, as evidenced by the doubts of Genl. Hunter played by Carroll O'Connor.  However he was overruled by Lt. Gen'l Clark played by an aged Michael Rennie who commisssioned the Devil's Brigade to storm a heavily fortified Italian mountaintop position.

The saving grace of the film was the impressive array of character actors lead by Claude Akins as Pvt. Rocky Rockwell and Jack Watson as Canadian Cpl. Peacock, among others.",1161907200,,1337,4.833333333333333
439819,4,6302224462,"I can't add anything to the very similar positive reviews already expressed, but what bothered me listening to the movie was that everyone was from California except the American Southerners.

Didn't they know that Canadians, just like New Englanders or New Yorkers or Southerners, have their own accents, and that at the very least, some effort should have been made to distinguish the speech of the Canadians from the sounds of the Americans?

And in the one place where they did try to show a ""real Canadian"" - the judo instructor - they made a caricature by portraying a red-headed Scot from Nova Scotia.

And, the same, I'm afraid, is true about any movie with ""Canadians.""  They are always all from Los Angeles.",1147132800,,717,4.804878048780488

The answer...because there aren't actors like William Holden, Claude Akins, Richard Jaekel and Jack Watson around anymore. The Devil's Brigade is a true story which accurately depicts the camaraderie all fighting men develop. It's great to see some real machismo stuff and not feminist, PC nonsense were subjected to nowadays. The real men of the Devil's Brigade helped save the world 60 years ago.",1115510400,25,481,5.10126582278481
439821,4,6302224462,"The 1st Special Service Force really existed and accomplished far more than this film would indicate.  Any critic who whines about ""improbable events"" is a gabbing ignoramus...
  Having said that... Most veterans of the Force do not like the film.  The idiots with checkbooks would only back the film if it was ""rousing"" (read Hollywood treatment) rather than lovingly accurate.
  The chief technical advisor was Lt. General Frederic (ret) himself... so the producers and director certainly had the facts to hand.  Many of those facts and much of the history never made it onto the screen.
  What don't the Forcemen like?  Well, the Americans certainly had more than their share of guardhouse sweepings and tough characters sent their way by other commands (though those who could not learn to accept discipline and bond with others were rapidly washed out...) and excellent Canadians... but the ""border warfare"" premise is essentially false.

  U.S. uniforms for all but the Americans got higher pay... (different pay days for each group, so always borrowing from each other)  When the drek was chased off both nationalities settled in quite well with each other.
  Kiska was almost bloodless (Canadian and American troops did accidentally shoot each other when the Japanese proved to have pulled out... but not the Force... their fire discipline was superb...)  One part of the Force was prepared to make a parachute drop into action... The Force had the ""friction"" of battle without the losses... This honed them to a fine edge... and the film ignored the whole episode.

  Their jump training was almost ignored (except for jump boots and jump wings shown on the screen) along with their demolition and amphibious training.  Their loving relationship with Helena and its people was reduced in the film to a night of whoring, boozing and brawling.
  In short, many vets of the Force did not recognize themselves in the film.  Relatively few people knew about the Force, and those seeing the film would either think it total fiction or else have a skewed view of what Winston Churchill called ""The finest fighting force of its size ever fielded by North America...""
  When viewed as a movie, rather than as history... Well the cast is pretty good.  Many cameos (not ""bit parts"") by fading stars such as Grechen Wyler and Dana Andrews... give it a certain class.
  William Holden would have been perfect in the part... a dozen years earlier when he was doing Bridge on the River Kwai... Frederic was almost a ""boy general"" by the time he left the Force... Holden was a bit long in the tooth and tired...  On the positive side, he conveys authority and was quite happy to get his hands dirty making the film.

  Cliff Robertson is fine as Major Crown and most of the rest of the cast is good.  Claude Akins is fine in his role as Rocky... but for all of his size, strength and toughness... his character is a waste... he gets captured on the earlier raid and rather than do what all good soldiers must in an assault... keep moving... he bounces around a critically wounded soldier, kills his prisoner and is absent from where he is needed.  His love of Peacock is believable, but is mawkishly displayed on the screen.

  So having said all of the above, why would *I* give the film a (qualified) rating of 4 stars (an unqualified five would go to Lawrence of Arabia...)?  In part because of the subject matter... However much the Hollywood treatment and however mucked up the history... the Force was one of the most remarkable units ever fielded.

  The director (Andrew V.) had some fine films to his credit, but too many of the other kind... to the point where some would call him a ""hack director...""  But it is obvious in The Devil's Brigade that he had a fondness for the unit and the men who served in it.  The cliches and overly broad humor can't hide this.
  Most of the cast (and assigned soldiers) give the impression that when the cameras stop rolling that they really felt like part of a team doing something special (even if a few of them refused to follow Holden into the pyrotechnic strewn fields...)
  While the film could have been better... to truly tell the story of the First Special Service Force... a multi-part effort such as Band of Brothers would be required to do the subject (and the surviving Forcemen) justice...

  I have served with Canadians in two wars... While there are some very real differences, at the ""sharp end"" the teamwork is outstanding... Never more true than with the 1st Special Service Force...",1088208000,26,4542,4.773778920308484
439852,4,6302224462,"William Holden, Cliff Robertson, and Vince Edwards turn in their customary fine performances in this excellent story about one of the early Special Operations units.  The storyline is simple enough.  A Special Ops unit is formed for a specific mission in Norway (the mission is eventually changed.  Nice bit part by Michael Rennie as General Mark Clark).  For reasons I was never quite clear on, the unit is comprised of equal parts of American misfits and Canadian elite troops.  (This is said to be historically accurate).  My favorite part of the movie is the interaction between the American rogues and the more cultured, but equally tough, Canadian troops.  There are some hilarious scenes that take place during pre-combat training which show how the unit gelled together into an elite force.
The action scenes are very well done, and the attitude of the regular army units towards the unconventional Special Ops unit is true-to-life.  Special Ops units have traditionally, at least until recently, been the orphans of the army, and that is brought out very well in this fine movie.

439853,2,6302224462,"I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie - but I thought ""what the heck, an action movie from the guy who made Chisum and The Wild Geese can't be all that bad."" But no. The battle scene (and yes, there's only one battle in the whole movie), when it finally does come in the last twenty minutes of so of this two plus hour movie, is surpisingly dull. The photos I'd seen of extras flying through the air are nowhere to be seen. What you get are too many long-shots of small figures scuttling around amidst too much smoke and dust (which makes it difficult to figure pout who is where and doing what). Now and again we'll go in for a close-up in time to see one of the main actors get killed, but before you know it the Germans have surrendered and William Holden is blahing on about losing too many men (a fact which isn't apparent on the screen). You're probably thinking I'm focussing too much on the action - that there should be more to a movie than this. But let's face it - The Devils Brigade is designed to be an action movie (the characters are all one dimensional and the dialogue between the fueding Canadians and American's is pretty trite stuff, and that, folks, is essentially the plot), so on that level it has to be considered a failure.",1048032000,8,1251,4.305084745762712
439854,4,6302224462,"The Devil's Brigade is a WWII story about the formation of a Special Forces unit meant to help the war effort in Europe.  A ragtag bunch of Americans and a crack unit of Canadian troops are brought together to train to form this unit.  Excellent cast with William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Vince Edwards, Dana Andrews, Carroll O'Connor, Richard Jaeckel, Claude Akins, Jeremy Slate, Andrew Prine, Luke Askew, and Richard Dawson in a pre-Family Fued role.
 Critics said The Devil's Brigade is a ripoff of The Dirty Dozen, but it really isn't.  While the storylines are similar, the overall idea of the movie is much different with the The Devil's Brigade dealing with a true story.  This movie is a great guy film with excellent performances by much of the cast.  There are some funny scenes as the Yanks and the Canucks get used to each other before the mandatory bonding scene during a barroom fight with a group of lumberjacks.
 The DVD presentation is good with the widescreen presentation and the theatrical trailer.  As another reviewer pointed out, the trailer contains Richard Jaeckel screaming as he falls from the cliff, something not in the movie.  Excellent World War II adventure story with great cast and good action scenes.  Don't miss it!",1044489600,5,1251,4.886255924170616

William Holden, Cliff Robertson, Claude Akins, and the rest of the cast really give inspired performances. They all come across as tough and proud and determined which is exactly what you expect from Special Forces soldiers.
I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes the WW II genre and an action oriented movie. It is not Saving Private Ryan, but it is still good entertainment.",1043625600,2,598,4.546296296296297
439856,3,6302224462,"I always thought this movie a bit corny.  The macho, kid stuff humor and rivalry between the Canadians and mis-fit Americans seems contrieved.  This was made when the movies loved to show how a group of reject GIs could somehow beat the Wehrmacht!  I question how accurate this movie is, despite all the praise for it from veterans who should know better!  The scene where they infiltrate the Germans and capture them is completely foolish. I'd like to see how this bunch would have stood up to a panzergrandier battalion in a fair fight.  The finale mountain battle scene is an attempt to make a big play for these guys.  Personally I think the battle lacks something, although at least it shows these losers taking some casualties which should have been a lot more than they show in the movie.  Also, German equipment is American, always visually distracting.  You would think a post war movie like this would have had access to better stuff.  William Holden does a gallent job holding this flimsy epic together with his tough commander bit, but personally I think there are better old WW2 battle flicks out there than this. I use to look at this one on TV strictly out of boredum if there was nothing better on.  I wouldn't waste my money bothering to own it.",1036713600,4,1262,4.618834080717488

439858,3,6302224462,"This DVD is of strictly average -- maybe even below average -- quality. Video quality is superb, better than the lastest VHS edition for sure and an improvement on the TCM widescreen prints.
The audio is 2.0 Mono but probably the best 2.0 mono I've heard. They haven't gone back and restored the audio track to make the gunfire sound clearer or anything like that but the sound does sound better than it did on video and TV. The Spanish sound track is a bit muffled (as always on these older movies) but sounds all right.
Special features aren't too ""special"". There's a cleaned up theatrical trailer (which has Richard Jaeckel screaming in pain when he falls from the cliff, that's not in the movie) 16 chapter selections, subtitles in English, French and Spanish and as I said the Spanish audio track.
There is no deleted footage, no production notes, no typical MGM booklet, and no feature about the real Devil's Brigade. All of that would have been interesting and improved the quality of this DVD. But, as it is, the transfer of the actual movie is very good and the DVD is worth say ten dollars just for the movie.
As for the movie, you can read all about on the IMDb. I give it 3/stars out of five; the characters were cardboard the could all have been better. That sequence with the brigade capturing 200 Germans in the village was also corny as ever.",1026432000,5,1359,4.528455284552845

As a war flick, its powerful. It shows the great pains undertaken by the allies to win the war, and it shows the great respect the Germans held for allied units.

The military camp used was Camp Williams while the mountain was on top of Lone Peak directly across the valley from the camp. Lone Peak was used because it looks so much like the mountains in Italy or rather the Swiss Alps in the summer months.

While the fighting is going on atop the mountain at the end, you can see Kennecot Copper mine in the upper right of the screen.
