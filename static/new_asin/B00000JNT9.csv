7912921,1,B00000JNT9,"Missed the boat. Directing was terrible. A few good actors, but also lots of bad. I Watched It because it got 4 stars. I can only give it one. Don't waste your time.",1408492800,,165,4.03030303030303
7912922,4,B00000JNT9,This is the first time I had ever heard of this movie.  It was really funny.  A lot of regular (off beat) people just trying to make it with really strange results happening.,1397952000,,174,4.242424242424242
7912923,4,B00000JNT9,"I saw this movie for the first time on video.  I originally rented it for Paul Anthony Stewart and Bai Ling.  What I ended up getting out of this movie was so much more than just seeing these two talented actors.  This  was really a story about a group of people, each trying to live their lives  and discover themselves, who are interrelated simply because of the fact  that they live in the same apartment building.  Touching and certainly  worthy of reaching cult-classic status.  I watched this movie three times  in one day before I was willing to return it to the video store!  I would  definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is in his/her formative years  or simply trying to come to terms with his/her independence.",952819200,7,730,4.609375
7912924,4,B00000JNT9,"there are as many reasons to see this picture as there are apartments in the Manhattan block where all the characters live. I went to this movie to see Bai Ling and discovered many other excuses to see it again including  Peter Stormare (from Fargo) and Ornella Muti (why isn't she in more films?)  Whoever you go and see - good to see Bulle Ogier and Karen Black making  appearances - you can't lose. Even Sandra Bernhard, whom I don't usually  like, is good and very funny in this. That's the great thing  about  'somewhere in the city', there are characters for all seasons, each with  their own story which are all recounted with such under-stated humor so  atypical of American films. Perhaps thats its problem, it is subtle. But  here subtle means multi-layered. Most overlooked part of this needlessly  overlooked film is John Cale's fantastic score. Where can I get that?This  little gem of a film has all the ingredients and performances to become a  classic. Worth checking out before it reaches cult-hood.",932947200,11,1016,4.775862068965517
