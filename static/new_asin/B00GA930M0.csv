8738687,2,B00GA930M0,"The movies on this disc set was ok. Two of the movies on the disc would not play at all,so I don't know if they were ok or not. Instead of trying to return the disc,I just chalked it up to a loss. After having the disc for over two years,the same two movies still won't play. I don't recommend buying used dvd's. Delivery was on time,5 stars for that. The two stars is for the entirety of the disc never would play and after over two years,still doesn't.",1519603200,,454,4.112359550561798
