This video gives perspectives from both the Canadian's who fought alongside the RAF and the German's who first had their own night bombing campaign; then had to try and stop the British/Canadian Bombing efforts.

Strong Points:

#1 Shows the technological advances by the Allies and Axis in the European night airwar.

#2 Shows museum examples of the tools used in this war such as Avro Lancaster, Ju-88, 88MM FLAK, Radars, searchlights etc.

#3 Excellent interviews with Canadian Airmen, German Airmen and  Axis & Allied aircraft ground controllers. The veterans are brutally honest about the failures and successes of both sides and individuals during the war.

#4 Strong narration.

#5 The video covers the training of Allied aircrews in Canada during with war.

Weak Points:

#1 There are a few spots in the videos where information is repeated. When originally shown this information may have been used as a refresher when watching the next episode? When watched in sequence some redundant information was unneeded.

#2 There is a flight sequence with a former German pilot in a vintage Douglas A-26 Invader (representing a Ju-88 nightfighter) approaching a airworthy Avro Lancaster. I felt the information had already been covered very well and the flight sequence added little to the video. (My opinion only) Other people watching this sequence may find this section informative.

I rated this video a four out of five. I would have rated it a five if the repeated items were removed.

The strong points greatly outnumber the few weak points so I do highly recommend these videos.",1267920000,,1695,5.07942238267148
8286394,4,B001CB96PQ,"The 3 DVD set is very well done.  Good sequences, and the video of surviving WWII aircraft will be good for modelers.  Very good documentary on the roles Radar played in the night bombing war over Germany.
