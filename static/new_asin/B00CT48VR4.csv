5738550,5,B00CT48VR4,"I own Season One and Season Two of Top Gear US, and this is the best Season so far!  They took out all the warehouse crap, like ""Big Star Small Car"", and just focused on the car action.  That was a big plus, and the stuff they do here is SUPER funny and entertaining!  I highly recommend this if you like cars, funny moments, and good ol' competition!",1437091200,,351,4.132352941176471

5738559,5,B00CT48VR4,"Top Gear is loads of fun to watch. The interaction between these three friends make the show funny and exciting to watch. Each episode has me cheering for a different friend and I am never disappointed with the results! If you have never watched this show before, I recommend getting any season and giving it a try. You will love it!",1407110400,,333,4.475409836065574
5738560,4,B00CT48VR4,If you liked Seasons 1 & 2 then you'll like this season as well. These three stooges perform stunts and modify cars in such a manner to keep the devout viewer entertained and waiting for the next episode and season.,1397174400,,215,4.4
5738561,5,B00CT48VR4,Nearly as funny as the original UK version. This crew gets itself into and out of trouble very easily. No need to like cars to enjoy the series.,1395964800,,144,4.178571428571429
5738562,5,B00CT48VR4,Can't wait until I can get season 4 it gets better with each episode. Funny and informative and even people who aren't car people can get into it,1395964800,,145,4.214285714285714
5738563,5,B00CT48VR4,Love this show just like their British cousins!!!  I have to do dialysis 3x a week & watching these nuts make the 5 hours fly faster than they can drive!!!,1393459200,,155,4.166666666666667
5738564,5,B00CT48VR4,Love this show!!!!! My family and I are huge fans of Top Gear (America) and will definitely buy the next season when it is available!,1393027200,,133,4.36
5738565,5,B00CT48VR4,"Top Gear USA has quickly become a favourite, and dare I say it even better than recent series of the original UK version.  Adam, Rutledge and Tanner have great camaraderie and are always entertaining.",1391904000,,200,4.882352941176471
5738566,5,B00CT48VR4,"I have two boys that love cars so I thought these DVD's would be right up their alley. And I was right, they do love them. My husband and I like them also. The one thing I will say is that when these episodes air on T.V. most of the bad words are bleeped out. They are NOT bleeped out on the DVD's so keep that in mind. Other than that, these are great.",1390521600,,353,3.7837837837837838
5738567,5,B00CT48VR4,"If you're a fan of the US Top Gear than you no doubt have seen this season. It's more of the stuff you love from Tanner, Rutledge, and Adam. More gorgeous cars, entertaining challenges, and the humor fans of the show love. I love this show!",1388793600,,240,4.239130434782608
5738568,3,B00CT48VR4,This is my favorite show but I only gave the DVD 3 stars because it is not fully edited like it is when I watch it on the history channel.  Not sure why they chose to do it that way because most of the episodes are edited but there are a few that aren't.,1388793600,,254,3.7037037037037037
5738569,5,B00CT48VR4,My son absolutely loves this dvd.  Top Gear is his favorite show in the world!  Thanks for all the laughs.,1382313600,,106,4.25
5738570,5,B00CT48VR4,"What can I say? I got hooked into the show including BBS' Top Gear UK. The show's hilarious and we will continue to purchase the DVDs as they become available. Great for viewing in the Excursion for those long trips. No more ""are we there yet, daddy""",1381968000,,250,4.340425531914893
5738571,5,B00CT48VR4,"I think this is one of the best seasons yet.  With every season the show really comes into it's own, and the change in this season shows it. I have season 1 & 2 as well.  I love to see what Adam Ferrara, Rutledge Wood and Tanner Foust are going to be up to with each episode. I am happy they did away with the ""Big Star in a Small Car"" segment as well as being in the hanger and focus on cars and the great challenges.  I don't know how many friends I have recommended this show to, or just made watch.  When season four is available I will be purchasing that as well.",1380931200,,568,3.9130434782608696
5738572,5,B00CT48VR4,"Love this show.  Quite a departure from the British version with a totally, ""different"" cast.  All three have something unique to add and blend very well together.  See some really cool cars, learn some things and often ask yourself, What The.......?",1380672000,,250,5.048780487804878
5738573,5,B00CT48VR4,"I ordered season 3 and was not disappointed. I had heard the 3rd season wasn't as good before seeing it but I don't agree. still incredibly funny and entertaining. I am curious why this season is partially censored. they'll bleep out one word then the next sentence not bleep out the same word. In some aspects I'm glad they got rid of the Big Star, Small Car and the lap times and in some aspects I wish it was still there. worth every dollar.",1379462400,4,444,4.2976190476190474
5738574,3,B00CT48VR4,"This is quite a funny show but for some reason they have dropped all the car reviews and star in a reasonable car laps.
It is now just a program of challenges.
It is enjoyable but not as good as the British original.",1378598400,,216,4.046511627906977
5738575,5,B00CT48VR4,"I love Top Gear Usa unfortunately you can't buy series 3 on iTunes in the UK so I had to buy the DVD from USA. Not that this has been a problem it arrived within 2 weeks of release.
This is a great series that seems to have been overlooked in the UK because of our version but, I (and lots of others) like this one better. I like the format of it unlike UK top gear, you just get 3 guys having a laugh with some cars. They are all very funny and genuinely are good friends, and seem to have actual knowledge of fixing cars which you don't get in UK top gear.
I love this DVD and could watch it everyday!",1378512000,2,603,3.870967741935484
5738576,4,B00CT48VR4,"I enjoyed the guys shinanigans like the previous seasons however, I missed star in a small car segment and having the stig race some cars around the track.",1378166400,,155,4.571428571428571
5738577,5,B00CT48VR4,"I'm very satisfied-very fast shipping, good quality-I can absolutely recommend this DVD.For everybody who loves cars-presendet in a funny way :)",1377561600,,144,5.904761904761905
5738578,4,B00CT48VR4,"Love this show. So far its a great release, I am just a little disappointed that the audio is censored for season 3 while season 2 was uncensored. Its also a little strange that the original theme song is back for the dvd, while when the episodes aired the them was replaced with something else. Also a little strange how this season the show is labeled Top Gear USA on the dvd while the past 2 seasons were just Top Gear.",1376784000,,422,4.222222222222222
5738579,5,B00CT48VR4,"Best season yet! I laughed till my sides hurt, plenty of episodes and great bonus features. To be honest I never watch bonus features except for top gear usa and they are on all 4 disc. You can watch these over and over again and not get tired. My favorite episode is the taxi driver challenge. Go team TG USA!",1376179200,,310,4.183333333333334
8586006,1,B00CT48VR4,"They have too much language. They drop the ""F"" word several times. Not family friendly. Would never recommend this show.",1528416000,,120,5.05
8586007,5,B00CT48VR4,So funny and super educational!,1521676800,,31,5.4

8586009,5,B00CT48VR4,"Top Gear USA have captured the fun and the ""what-the-hell"" attitude.  Well Done.",1478044800,,80,5.153846153846154

8586011,5,B00CT48VR4,My son loves it.  He loves the series.,1458777600,,38,3.75
8586012,5,B00CT48VR4,They made a great decision to break away from the UK formula on this season. I still think tanner is a tool.,1455408000,,108,3.9545454545454546
8586013,5,B00CT48VR4,"The History Channel edited out the foul language. I wish it was edited out on the DVD.
Also the History Channel didn't play the opening music that is featured here. I would rather listen
to the History Channel's intro.",1450742400,,218,4.615384615384615
8586014,4,B00CT48VR4,"Not as good as Season 2 or 4 but a step forward in Top Gear USA thinking.  No more studio time.  Most of the ""challenges"" are directly from the BBC flagship Top Gear.  There are some unique American twists which play well with these presenters.

One oddity about this season is the bleeping/editing of curse words.  Season 1 is fully edited.  Season 2 is fully unedited.  This season it's hit or miss.  Sometimes in the same breath.  Which can be quite funny.",1440374400,,459,4.5
8586015,5,B00CT48VR4,"There seems to be a divide between those fans of the original BBC ""Top Gear"" and those of us who also love America's version. There is plenty of room in the world for all of us.
These video collection from America's Top Gear will leave you with both a ton of information about cars. Which quite honestly, I have no interest in. But what I do love is the hysterical antics of the men. I could watch their show every week and never get tired of it.",1440028800,,446,4.137931034482759
