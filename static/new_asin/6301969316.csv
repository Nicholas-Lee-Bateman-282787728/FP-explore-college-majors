395317,4,6301969316,"After seeing this movie again recently, I know what the real shortcoming is. It's simply that the subclimactic scenes are treated with the imposed impact of a climax. In other words, since so much terror is trying to be  throttled out of every decisive individual scene, the impact of the climax  is let down. If maybe the handling in these vital--but not  climactic--scenes had implied the terror more subtly, the denouement would  have taken on the power of a crescendo, thus making it much more effective;  and thereby, satisfying. Everything I stated below about this picture still  goes. (Except maybe I was a little too harsh on ol' Joe Cotten. They just  don't give him much room to make an impact.) All  told, this is still one  of the most terrifying movies ever made, a real masterpiece of atmosphere.",923702400,,811,4.776978417266187

DVD Review
By Sandy Salmon
Gaslight, starring Ingrid Bergman, Charles Boyer, Joseph Cotte n, 1944

Lowering gaslights (indicating pre-electric light times, 19th century times), strange noises from the attic and deep London fog which aids in nefarious work. All the ingredients for a full-blown old-time example of a suspense film without any gore or pyrotechnics. Oh yes, and a mad man obsessed by something which is driving him beyond the edges of rationality. This is what drives this first-rate classic Gaslight which garnered the beautiful and talented Ingrid Bergman last seen in this space playing the loyal wife, well kind of loyal wife, of Nazi-resister Victor Lazlo in the film Casablanca her first Oscar.
Heres why beyond her beauty and the depth of her performance in the part. Paula, Ms. Bergmans role, is a sensitive and reserved young woman having had her famous opera singer aunt whom she lived with as a young girl murdered for unknown reasons. Paula follows in her footsteps or tries to. Then love enters the scene. The love of a pianist, Gregory, or whatever his real name was as we shall find out, played by Charles Boyer (whom I do not recall having mentioned in this space previously) who sweeps her off her feet. They marry and return (at his request) to the London house where Paula came of age.

Then the craziness begins. Craziness egged on by our boy Gregory who has an ulterior motive for attempting to undermine Paulas sanity. A goodly portion of the film is spent on detailing the many vulgar and nefarious ways Gregory plays out his hand. He almost had her over the edge (with help from that noise in the attic, the London fog and those damn flickering gaslights-and a little help by the snooty housemaid played by a very young Angela Lansbury).

Naturally this torture cant, or wont, go on forever, because of a chance encounter with one Inspector Cameron, played by Joseph Cotton, last seen in this space hunting down like a dog his old friend Harry Lyme in Vienna who had gone over his own deep end. The Inspector had been an admirer of Paulas aunt as a child and wondered about the craziness going on between Paula and Gregory. Once he stepped in you knew it was curtains for the dastardly Gregory. Yeah, the mad monk Gregory had in his younger wanting habits days killed the aunt with the idea of grabbing her precious jewels and living the high life instead of being a stumblebum pianist for budding students. The whole ruse was to get control of that London house so he could grab the jewels hidden somewhere up in the attic in peace. All he will get in the end will be the hangmans noose. A little loose in places and some of Ms. Bergmans emoting seemed overdrawn but a very good suspense film without like I said gore or bells and whistles.",1498262400,,2840,4.710261569416499

395766,4,6301969316,Gaslight is a phenomenal classic.  I remember seeing it years ago but recently heard it in reference to the current political climate to I decided to purchase a copy.

395771,5,6301969316,"What a surprise this 70+ year old gem was!  We had been hearing a lot about the resurgence of the term ""Gas lighting"" in common speech, and this film contributes to the origin of the term.

395849,5,6301969316,"A classic!! Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to know where the term ""gaslight"" comes from. Ingrid Bergman shines.",1485820800,,121,5.421052631578948
395850,5,6301969316,"For anyone who uses the term gas light or if someone has told you you are being ""gaslighted"" it's good to know the original movie, where the term comes from.  And it's an excellent movie.",1485734400,,187,4.3428571428571425
395851,5,6301969316,"In popular culture, the term gaslight or gaslighting has come to mean causing a person to disbelieve their own factual knowledge and thereby doubt their sanity.  Although it has enjoyed widespread use since the 2016 election of Donald Trump, the term dates back to the 1940s, and very specifically arises from the hugely successful 1940 play by Patrick Hamilton and the extremely popular 1944 film based on it.

Paula leaves London after her aunt is murdered.  A decade or so later older Paula (Ingrid Bergman) is studying music in Italy, where she meets and falls in love with Gregory (Charles Boyer.)  The two marry and return to London, where she has inherited her aunts house.  Paula is nervous about living in the house where her aunt was murdered, and when she is alone in the house at night she sees the gas lights dim and hears strange sounds from the attic, which is sealed off.  Gregory tells her it is all in her mind.  At first he is comforting, but as Paula become more anxious, he accuses her of memory lapses during which she moves or steals items, and he ultimately refuses to allow her to leave the house.  Paula slides toward a psychotic breakbut a chance encounter with a police inspector (Joseph Cotton) revives interest in her aunts murder and explains her mental state.

Directed by George Cukor, GASLIGHT has a darkly romantic quality, flawless production values, and spectacular Oscar-nominated performances by Bergman (who won), Boyer, and a very young Angela Lansbury.  Bergman is particularly memorable, playing to a level rarely seen in Hollywood films of the period.  At present the DVD is only available in a print-on-demand formatbut the earlier DVD release also includes the 1940 British film version starring Diana Wynyard and Anton Walbrook, a more straight forward melodrama.  In any case, GASLIGHT is more than worth seeking out.  Recommended.

Very educational about how a man messes with a woman's mind with the intent of reducing her common sense and making her doubt her own mind.

Gregory slowly and systematically drives Paula into insanity so that he can search through Paula's aunt's (a famous singer) things to find items that he has coveted for many, many years.  Bergman plays the part so well and the BEST scene in the world is one of the last scenes of the show, while Bergman gives this fiery monologue to her liar of a husband!

That just struck me, because I was waiting for the whole plot to be about him f'ing with the gas and then being like, ""Nope! Looks the same to me!""

That said, I wanted to punch him in the face, repeatedly, for being so mean to Ingrid! And then I wanted to cry because women were so screwed back then (most didn't have a secret admirer hiding out to help them).

George Cukor and especially cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg also deserve  mention.

Ingrid Bergman (Paula) and Charles Boyer (Gregory) give award performances. Boyer's character is so evil and Bergman's is so trusting and vulnerable. You also meet Joesph Cotton, he saves the day, and Angela Lansbury (age 17), a dislikeable young maid that delights in adding to the anguish of Paula. Gregory attempts to drive Paula crazy by making her doubt her memory and senses so he can gain access to her house to search for jewels. The ending is great. The frustration and anticipation is awesome. I found out recently that the word ""Gaslighting"" has been adopted by some to describe a devious and deliberate process by someone to cause another. to doubt their senses. This film shows that it works.",1400371200,2,822,4.795774647887324

But this one is really well done!  It is so good that a psych term was created called ""gaslighting"" based on the psychological manipulation/abuse portrayed in the movie.

Boyer plays the role of Bergman's seemingly perfect husband.  He is handsome, charming and doting.  What more could a woman ask for?  Bergman is young, beautiful, sweet and very naive.  Slowly he manipulates her into thinking she is going crazy.  He hides things from her and leads her to believe she is becoming more and more forgetful (i.e. losing her mind).  His condescending way of say ""Paula"" when she has ""lost something again"" is priceless.  One of the shockers was seeing Angela Landsbury as a young tart.  That in itself is a must see!!  It's basically the 1944 version of ""Who the Bleep Did I Marry.""  This movie is worth the price of admission and oh so good!!",1400371200,2,1005,4.636363636363637

Dame May Whitty as a nosy neighbor and Joseph Cotton as the alert police detective trying to help. The costumes, the story, and the scenery just great!",1384214400,,488,4.620689655172414
397092,5,6301969316,"Great acting all around. Ingrid Bergman especially. Her transformation from blissful newly wed to trapped and despairing young wife trying to please her ever more demanding and demented husband (Charles Boyer) is a remarkable tour de force. And, oh was Boyer a deceptively smooth charmer; a true wolf in sheep's clothing. Bergman deserved her Oscar. He deserved - slight spoiler here - his comeuppance. Joseph Cotton is ever so gallant, and a thankfully astute observer. The young and most impertinent maid (Angela Lansbury) is terrific. Her impudence is almost slap-worthy. The crusty hard of hearing housekeeper with a heart of gold and the nosey neighbor played to perfection by Dame May Whitty tops the cast with pitch perfect performances. George Cukor does a wonderful job of capturing the ever-ominous foggy London nights as well as the claustrophobic interior rooms and parlors of the house[s]. He has directed a taut psychological thriller with great aplomb. Yes, as some have noted: worthy of Hitchcock. The film title has become a noun and verb used in psychology and is aptly descriptive of a sadly more common than one would like to admit psychological impairment. When one is at the receiving end of such deplorable treatment it is truly psychically devastating. There should be more Joseph Cotton types as guardian angels or it could indeed be lights out for the one being ""gaslighted.""",1383436800,2,1401,5.122270742358078

397165,4,6301969316,"The term ""gaslighting"" got its name from this psychological thriller.

GASLIGHT is about the psychological torture inflicted upon Paula (Ingrid Bergman) by her husband Gregory (Charles Boyer). In classic sociopath and narcissistic behavior, he systematically makes her believe she is losing her mind so he can control her every move, for reasons I will not divulge.
Fifteen minutes into the movie the plot (ending) becomes apparent, but it's not only the storyline that makes GASLIGHT so compelling, it's the methodical brainwashing by Gregory,and the eery recognition that, ""I knew someone who played these games on me!"" albeit in a much subtler fashion. Research the word ""gaslighting"" and I guarantee you know someone, too.
Angela Lansbury makes her brilliant motion picture debut as the quirky, street smart housekeeper Nancy.
Joseph Cotton steals the show with his performance as Detective Cameron. His scenes with Ingrid Bergman are the most memorable.

Twice orphaned girl (first by mother and then by murdered aunt who raised her) marries foreign man while abroad only to return to the house her aunt raised her in. Things start disappearing. Even the audience doesn't know how they disappear. ""Weird"" stuff starts happening like things being moved around the house. Even the audience doesn't know. Noises are heard upstairs where no one is allowed. The gas lights lower at night as a sign that someone else is in the house using gas--straining the supply so the lights lower in other rooms. The husband mysteriously disappears every evening. He has the top floor of the house blocked off for some odd reason. The aunt's murder was not really solved. Scotland Yard is introduced talking about the case. The husband begins to think the wife is mad. The wife thinks she is mad. The audience questions her sanity.

Comments:
Classic murder/thriller mystery. The aunts murder is not really the focus but the cause of the events. Is it the mad wife? Is the it the loose maid who you question is messing around with the husband? Is it the weird foreign husband? Classic mystery. While I really can't stand watching movies about weak people being manipulated this was a pretty good movie. It was entertaining like movies should be. Nothing scandalous. Nothing shocking. Nothing offensive. Just a good story. And of course in the end all wrongs are righted so you don't have that miserable feeling like modern day movies and TV show would leave you feeling just so that they can be ""different""--have an  unpredictable ending. This movie could have taken the turn that modern day soap operas have where the evil characters continue to victimize the good characters where the good characters are just that--victims and annoying. But it doesn't. You also start to think that perhaps this is a precursor to the modern day slasher movies where the damsel in distress is a mindless, helpless, quivering rabbit, leaving you irritated at how stupid the character is. But right before you want to give up on it it turns itself around. Of course in this era you have the dramatic music that is supposed to highten the emotions which is kinda silly in some spots. You have the over the top acting in some spots--the looks, the quick turns, the close up of the eyes, etc. But all in all this is a good movie and these things are just minor distractions.",1368230400,7,2387,4.749397590361446

397256,5,6301969316,"A Unique Movie In Western Cinematography

The movie ""Gaslight"" is a superb rendition of the shakespearean battle of wills (superbly reminiscent of King Lear and his madness, his poignant foibles). The very name of the movie evokes a symbolic meaning (something tender and vulnerable like a flame in danger of extinction, just like the happiness of a young girl or the soul of a lady .. or the Spirit of Culture).

This movie is completely TIMELESS as far as the recording of the essentials of the Western-European spirituality is concerned. A Frenchmen Boyer pitted against a Nordic diva Bergman, defended from the distance by the knightly Cotten and seemingly oddly egged-on by Lady Whitty (all of whom were creme-of-the-crop thespians from the Walhalla of Western acting). It is as much a battle between intellectual wills as an abysmal struggle with inner daemons lurking in the soul's chasm.

The powerful but devious battle of wills between the chief protagonists is ingenuously interleaved within the storyline. The movie plot is supremely depicted within the appropriate foggy/sunny dichotomy of the classical London existence from the heyday of Victorian Western Culture period - and deserves nothing but our awe and our gratitude rooted in our appreciation for the historical value of this cinematic composition.

The movie plot is dynamic through-and-through, loaded with subtle detail easily overlooked by the casual watcher, but available to the perceptive one for a fuller experience. The engine of this dynamic: The northern openness of soul instilled in a Grecian somatic beauty and tenderness of aristocratic lady-character of actress Ingrid Bergman in a complex (but not fully incompatible) contrast with the 'southern race-cunning' of the devious, impetuous, tyrannical, Napoleonic pivot of relentless willpower of actor Charles Boyer. A noble desire to be of service is in trouble with the relentless drive towards a fixed, manic, obsessive and self-destructive goal. How very Faustian!

The Black-and-White scenes of the movie greatly enhance the gothic ambient of the movie's settings, and make the situations more artistically enhanced because the Baudelaire-esque psychology of the movie is supported by the effusive and accented shadows of grayness and blackness, greatly suffusing the sense of this signature European high drama.

If on the ruins of our world, aliens from another planet were to some day enquire about the most culturally representative Western-European movie ever made - it would be ""Gaslight"" (1944).",1357689600,,2544,5.444162436548224
397277,5,6301969316,"A movie so striking that its title has become a byword! Charles Boyer develops his portrait of evil smoothly, and with twists that lead the viewer to wonder how far he might go. Ingrid Bergman shrinks in upon herself, becoming more and more helpless and lost, but she never quite loses that vital spark. The lighting develops an ominous atmosphere, between the gloom of the old mansion and the spooky London fog. The contrast with the bright lights and glittering guests at the big society party underlines the isolation and madness of Bergman's situation. Joseph Cotten is aloof, yet passionate. Angela Lansbury (only 18!) provides a dash of spice, and Dame Mae Witty is welcome comic relief. A terrific movie, and it holds up very well.",1357603200,,738,4.865079365079365

She loves him enough to tell him that her aunt left her a house in London. Soon after, they get married and move there. Unfortunately for her, he's not as he once seemed.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!:

We see Paula getting driven mad by her husband. She does not leave the house, she does not have any friends. The best part about this film was that everything was done so gradually and the husband acted in such a way that Paula didn't even realise what was happening.

What is Paula's husband after?

Charles Boyer is the suave and handsome musician who insinuates himself into her life and isolates her from all other influences.

Anyone who has ever been in or near a domestic violence situation will recognize the tactics of the abuser.

397337,4,6301969316,"I've heard the term ""to gaslight"" someone so I thought it was time to watch the film that stuck with people to such an extend that its title became a term for a method of psychological torture.

The talent involved in GASLIGHT automatically makes the film a must view. Directed by George Cukor, GASLIGHT brings together two European stars - Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. Add in Joseph Cotten and an 18-year-old Angela Lansbury in her first film role, and you have quite a cast.

GASLIGHT is the ultimate romantic thriller that reminds one of a classic Alfred Hitchcock film even though this is pure George Cukor. Parts of it remind me of REBECCA and another Bergman film NOTORIOUS. The dark foggy city of London sets the stage for this psychological adventure.

Though it is slow moving, GASLIGHT shines on the talents of Boyer and Bergman. Bergman's character, Paula, has fled her Victorian home in London and lives abroad for many years after the murder of her beloved aunt. She meets debonair painist Gregory played by Charles Boyer and they marry and move back to her home in London.

The perfect love story soon begins to unfold as Gregory begins to ""gaslight"" Paula into thinking she is losing her mind. Feeding her misinformation, Gregory leads Paula into thinking she is ""forgetting"" and losing control of reality. It is a subtle scenario that goes on for a while and it is not quite clear what Gregory's extact motives and intentions are. Scotland Yard investigator Brian, played by Joseph Cotten, begins to suspect a sinister meaning to Paula's housebound situation.

GASLIGHT is lacking in a lot of areas. The story is slow. The setting is dark and dreary but both Boyer and Bergman shine in their roles. Their facial expressions and their delightful accents add charm to the film. Angela Lansbury as the cockney maid is a far cry from her role as Jessica Flecther in MURDER SHE WROTE.

Ingrid Bergman plays the lead, Paula, and she glows even as she goes mad. She goes mad so convincingly and so beautifully.

Charles Boyer is Gregory, her wicked husband. Why is he gaslighting her? Yes, the title has become a verb over the years.

Joseph Cotten is Brian Cameron, who has something to do with Scotland Yard and something to do with the beautiful opera star who was Paula's aunt (picture obviously is of Bergman) and who was murdered when Paula was something like 12 years old. Bergman successfully played herself as a 12-year-old: that's talent. Also good makeup and hair experts.

And speaking of very young actresses who played this movie to perfection, there is Angela Lansbury (yes, Jessica Fletcher) as Nancy, the young housemaid. She was nominated for an Academy Award for this, her first movie role.

397391,2,6301969316,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

A criminal burglarizes the home of a wealthy opera singer in London, looking for a set of expensive jewels. During the burglary he murders the opera singer but when the singer's nine year old niece interrupts the crime, the criminal flees after failing to discover where the jewels are hidden in the home. This is essentially the opening of the old Hollywood chestnut, 'Gaslight', starring Hollywood icon, Ingrid Bergman, as Paula Alquist Anton, the protagonist of this rather slow-moving, dated 'mystery-thriller'.

Following the murder, little Paula is sent to Italy where she studies to become an opera singer like her aunt. Now as an adult, her music teacher becomes exasperated with her as her mind is never on her music studies and she can never give up obsessing about the murder of her aunt. She ends up returning to the old house in London where her aunt met her demise after meeting Gregory Anton (played by another Hollywood icon, Charles Boyer) who is her piano accompanist during her opera lessons and an aspiring composer. All the courtship scenes between Paula and Gregory set in Italy serve as unnecessary exposition and it takes quite a bit of time before we get to the meat and potatoes of the story: Gregory's attempt to gain control of Paula's home by convincing her that she's losing her mind.

Later on in the film, we learn that Gregory gains access to the attic, where Paula (at Gregory's behest) has placed all of her aunt's belongings. Gregory gains access by entering an domiciled home, two houses down the block, then climbing onto the roof and through a skylight into the attic. The question arises why he never entered the home to look for the jewels years before Paula had reached the age to enter into marriage. It's posited that since the jewels would have been so easily recognized as stolen, Gregory would have been unsuccessful in fencing them, so the only way he could take possession, was by having his wife committed and legally being declared the new and complete owner of her estate.

Unfortunately, once Paula discovers the letter from 'Sergius Bauer' addressed to his aunt, coupled with Gregory's angry outburst, it becomes pretty clear that Bauer and Gregory Anton are the same person. Act Two involves one repetitious scene after another of Gregory attempting to drive Paula batty by making her believe that she's either hallucinating or stealing items from him or the home. It all begins with the brooch Gregory gives Paula, which she loses at the Tower of London. Soon afterward, a picture is no longer in the frame on the wall and again Gregory blames Paula for taking it. When Paula finally finds the picture behind a table, Gregory accuses her of having put it there (when it's obvious that Gregory has been hiding all the objects all along).

More of Gregory's tired machinations are trotted out before the climax. That includes the footsteps Paula hears up in the attic (that's actually Gregory rummaging upstairs trying to find the aunt's jewels) and the gaslights dimming up and down, with Gregory once again, at the controls. The 'last straw' is when Paula finally insists on getting out of her cloistered existence by accepting a socialite's invitation to a party. There, Gregory pulls another one of his 'hide and seek' routines, pretending his watch has been stolen and now finding it in Paula's purse. Clueless Paula, who is not only besotted with bad boy Gregory to begin with, and is also fragile due to the tragic circumstances of her childhood, is unable to trust herself, despite knowing deep down that Gregory's accusations are untrue.

With little suspense for a good chunk of the film, we at least get to enjoy the antagonist's comeuppance at the hands of the solid as a rock Scotland Yard Inspector, Brian Cameron (played by solid as a rock 'Yankee' actor, Joseph Cotton). He's been trailing Gregory all along and with the help of a cop on the beat along with the Anton's servants, manages to subdue the villain, tying him up in the attic (one wonders why Director Cukor chose not to show the fight between Cameron and Anton, up in the attic).

While Ingrid Bergman does take on a role that would NOT make any feminist proud throughout most of the film, the film's scenarists throw the woman's movement a bone by finally having Paula give Gregory his due--she pretends she's insane, unable to 'recall' where the knife is, which Gregory could use to set himself free.

'Gaslight' is based on a stage play that's rooted in an earlier time. It's poorly written but features some nifty 'noirish' cinematography and excellent over the top acting from the principals along with Angela Lansbury in her first screen role. Lansbury plays one of the servants, a sassy working-class gal who adds to the protagonist's paranoia at every turn. It's an excellent performance but one wonders how Lansbury could have been nominated for best supporting actress at the Oscars, since her on screen time is extremely limited.",1325980800,3,5014,4.8629976580796255

397458,5,6301969316,"Gaslight is a superb example of a woman-in-peril suspense film. It is a psychological thriller, perfectly atmospheric, set in a foggy, dark London of the Victorian period.

Ingrid Bergman's performance as a woman slowly losing her mind is great - she received an Oscar for it. She is the victim of games being played to make her doubt her sanity. (The term to gaslight someone to make them doubt themself comes from the movie's title. It refers to the frequent dimming of the gas lights she sees.)

Charles Boyer is the devil trying to destroy his wife's mind, and Joseph Cotten the dashing, intelligent inspector whose suspicions save the day. Angela Lansbury, at 18 years old, makes her screen debut in this very enjoyable, albeit old film.",1292544000,,742,4.834645669291339

397461,5,6301969316,"George Cukor's ""Gaslight"" is so wonderfully polished and compelling an entertainment that it's hard to know where to begin with the praise. Of course Cukor's direction is impeccable, as are the photography and production design. But the performances are really what make ""Gaslight"" unforgettable. Ingrid Bergman won the first of her two Oscars for ""Gaslight;"" while to my taste she overdoes a couple of her hysterical scenes, she is still one of the most beautiful actresses who ever stood before a camera, and she could be fascinating just reading the phone book. My favorite performances in ""Gaslight"" are Charles Boyer, portraying one of the slimiest, most perfidious swine in cinematic history, and Angela Lansbury as a tarty, smart-mouthed maid. (Lansbury is so utterly convincing here that it's hard to believe that she was still a teenager, or that this was her very first screen role.) Add Joseph Cotten's noble police detective and Dame May Whitty's nosy neighbor, and you have a cast for the ages.

It's interesting to contrast the Cukor ""Gaslight"" with Thorold Dickinson's slightly earlier British version. MGM suppressed the British version for years in order to promote Cukor's film, and only recently has the British version become available again. While the Cukor version is in my opinion the better of the two, the British version is still very good. I love its evocation of Victorian London and especially the performance of Anton Walbrook, who to my mind is every bit as good as Boyer in the villain's role. Walbrook's performance is more histrionic than Boyer's, but no less compelling.",1284076800,,1605,5.125954198473282

397465,5,6301969316,"Ingrid Bergman received a Best Actress award from the Academy for her performance in the 1944 version of Gaslight. As anyone knows, the Oscars are not necessarily a good guide to fine acting but, in this case, she deserved it in spades. This taut, suspenseful production, superbly directed by the great George Cukor, also features fine performances from Charles Boyer, Angela Lansbury (17, going on 18) and Joseph Cotten. But it is Bergman's performance which elevates this film out of the ruck, so that it takes its place among the best of its type. The DVD transfer, on the whole, is good, although the print from which it was made shows considerable signs of wear in the first 10 minutes, and the whole thing could do with a restoration/clean.

397488,3,6301969316,"Bergman and Boyer really carry this otherwise rather lightweight thriller.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, and one that I recommend, but it cannot be understated that this film has been done before, and done better (just 4 years earlier at that).  The mood is captured (if a tad stiffened by the weightlessness of a lot of the scenes) and the acting is outstanding (by the two leads) but the overall finished product is a tad underwhelming to tell you the truth.

The film opens with a mysterious murder that leaves a young and scarred woman named Paula fleeing for her sanity basically.  A decade later and she is swept off her feet by the charming yet obviously creepy Gregory Anton and gets herself married and winds up back in the house where the murder took place.  As the days tick by she finds that either she is losing her mind or her husband is playing some dirty tricks on her.  He keeps her prisoner in the house, blaming her isolation on her health (she's forgetful and a danger to herself and others).  A young man who was once infatuated with Paula's deceased aunt begins to pick away at the shell around the Anton family and soon discovers that Gregory is not what he seems.

Well, he is what he seems, but for some reason Paula doesn't see it like we do.

For me, this film lives and dies in the hands of Bergman and Boyer.  Bergman won the Oscar for her dynamic portrayal of a woman going mad.  Her final scene, in the attic, is OUTSTANDING to put it simply.  Boyer is just devilishly good here and, in my humble opinion, is the films standout.  His character is over the top (hammy according to some) and very obvious (how you can NOT think he is a creep up to no good is BEYOND me) but it works gloriously for what the film is trying to accomplish.  He is just too much fun to ignore.

For me, the supporting cast is just stand-ins really.  I don't understand Lansbury's nomination, beings that she doesn't really do much of anything.  It's a decent and serviceable performance, but nothing to write home about.  I agree that Cotten is stiff.  Dame May Whitty is a stereotype, but she is fun to watch so I forgive her.

The thing for me is that the films conclusion (aside from the Bergman confrontation) is a bit underwhelming.  Finding out what the source of the noises were was, while predictable, a bit boring.  I just wanted to wowed by something totally intense and just `IN YOUR FACE' and I just got something I saw coming a mile away.  The film is good, and if you get a chance to see it I recommend you do for the stunning lead performances, but this is no Hitchcock (even though many believe it is) and in my opinion he did this very same thing much better.",1259539200,2,2696,4.3694779116465865

397561,4,6301969316,"I have passed by this movie many times in the library, and finally decided to pick it up. I was glad that I did! It satisfied my need for something subtle and suspenseful.

Paula was living in London with her aunt, a famous singer/actress, Alice. Her aunt was violently killed and Paula was traumatized. So she fled, as her aunt was the only parent known to her. While she is trying to become a singer herself, she falls in love with the piano player after only having known him for two weeks. After lots of pressure, Gregory pursuades Paula to move back to her house, the one her aunt died in. After all, it was left to her.

It is then that Paula seems to change from an active, full of life woman, to someone who is ill, isolated, and depressed. Every night, she hears footsteps in the attic, (no one else does, especially the half-deaf cook)and the gaslight appears to go down, when no one in the house is touching another. Her husband is also not the same man she married. The maid and the cook don't understand what is wrong with her. She doesn't have anyone to turn to, and slowly goes mad. But, why?

Though you realize pretty early what will happen at the end and who the killer is, it doesn't ruin the movie for you. The acting is excellent, especially by Nancy (played by an adorable 18 year old Angela Lansbury) the sardonic, and slightly tarty maid.

397564,5,6301969316,"George Cukor takes ""Gaslight"" from the stage to the screen.  This film is done so well, that one would immediately guess that Alfred Hitchcock directed it.

What makes this film work so well (and something that very few of today's directors understand) is the subtlety in which Charles Boyer (Anton) makes his wife feel that she is losing her mind.  Unfortunately, many of today's films rest in the violence and gore.  I have found that films are more suspenseful when they don't show you everything.  Hitchcock was a master of this, and Cukor shows the same restraint here.  Don't believe me?  Check out ""Psycho"" again and see how much is not shown on the screen, but allowing the viewer to fill in the blanks with his/her own imagination.  This is a far more effective style of film-making.

The film immediately starts off with aftermath of a murder in London, in which Paula (Ingrid Bergman) is being sent away after the tragic events that end with the death of her aunt.  The film then jumps some ten years into the future with Paula living in Italy where she meets her future husband, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer).  Things appear to be well between them.  But is Anton's true agenda and how is it linked with events of the past?  I won't divulge any details about that here for those who have not seen the film.

Ingrid Bergman (perhaps one of the greatest actresses in film history) took home her first Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in this film.  It's not hard to understand why.  She takes Paula from a sweet and happy young woman to someone who doesn't trust her own mental faculties anymore.  This sounds like an easy job for an actress, but it isn't.  She has to make the viewer begin to question things as well, and she does.  The ending allows her the tremendous payoff that we've been waiting for ever since the film began, and we revel in her ultimate triumph along with her character.

Charles Boyer is fantastic as the sinister Anton.  He also creates a complex character who, at first, appears sympathetic toward his young wife to someone who is quickly losing patience with her.  But, is there something else at work?  Charles Boyer can give a hard gaze that would make anybody begin quaking in their shoes.

Finally, one of my favorite character actors (Joseph Cotton) plays a young assistant at Scotland Yard who was a great admirer of Paula's aunt (who was a great singer in her day).  He feels that something is not entirely right with Paula and her husband.  Paula is all but shunned away from the public.  Anton feels that he can't allow her illness to be given public light.  The young assistant decides to find out for himself, and perhaps help Paula in the process.

I've been a huge Ingrid Bergman fan for years, and this was one of the first films of hers that I came across.  I loved it immediately, and quickly decided that this was the best psychological thriller that I'd ever seen.  It works on so many levels that still work today.

Keep an eye out for a very young Angela Lansbury as a saucy maid.  She looks so young!

If you're looking for great suspenseful fun weaves a tapestry through the long lost art of subtley without the violence and gore, then you are in for a true treat!  Gaslight more than fits the bill!",1194048000,7,3270,4.560137457044673

397622,5,6301969316,"There are two movies and three strong reasons to love this dvd.  The disk contains two versions of GASLIGHT, based on Patrick Hamilton's stage play.  The first, from 1940, is director Thorold Dickinson's English version starring Diana Wynyard as the retiring young wife and Anton Walbrook as the husband who is trying to drive her insane.  The second is the famous one, directed in Hollywood by George Cukor in 1944, starring Ingrid Bergman (she won an Oscar for this one) and Charles Boyer.

 I watched the 1940's version first and, somewhat to my surprise, enjoyed it very much.  Walbrook's character in the first movie is the epitome of effete villainy, a hiss-able cad whose cruelty made me squirm.  Boyer's husband, on the other hand, is a charming rogue with a cold, calculating, concealed and congealed heart.  They both get the job done, but Boyer does so in a more believable manner.  In the first movie Diana Wynyard's character is extremely shy and retiring, almost to the point where you wonder how she ever managed to make it to adulthood.  Ingrid Bergman is given a character more assertive, even though still under her husband's control.

 If you can't tell by now, the third reason I love this dvd is the chance it gives to see the evolution of a screenplay by comparing the two movies.  That we're given the opportunity to make the comparison is ironic - reports have it that the studio tried to destroy all copies of the '40 GASLIGHT when they released Cukor's version.  They shouldn't have worried.  Although the `40 version is good, Cukor's is a classic.  Wynyard is good is her showcase role while Bergman is transcendent.",1140307200,14,1643,4.7935943060498225
397623,4,6301969316,"and I really enjoyed it! ""Gaslight"" is a suspense thriller with a Hitchcock eeriness to it - I was hooked. I felt as though I was being driven out of my own mind just watching Charles Boyer cunningly captivate Ingrid Bergman and manipulate her thoughts and emotions. I was burning with fury as he was so agrivatingly sly, and so subtle. Meanwhile, Bergman was perfect at playing the downslide from independence to vulnerable destruction. What was great about it was the two were believable as husband and wife - there was a sexual tone and moments of redemption on Boyer's part that complicated my sympathies. It's films like this that make you question your own sanity just a little as you realize how blurred the line is between what you think you know and don't know at all...

Angela Lansbury was also a real surprise, playing a brilliantly cheerful maid who manages to brighten this otherwise chilling drama. Excellent entertainment, my mother and I were hooked. If you like Hitchcock-style thrillers, this one is for you!",1136937600,2,1027,4.8352272727272725
397624,5,6301969316,"If you like old movies (and especially if you like Ingrid Bergman), then you'll have no choice but to fall in love with 1944's version of ""Gaslight"" (directed by George Cukor). This is good old-time filmmaking at its very best.

Ingrid Bergman is magnificent as ""Paula Alquist Anton"", who recently married the suave and sophisticated ""Gregory Anton"" (played by Charles Boyer, who was never better, and never more sinister and underhanded than we find him here).

Little did Paula know when she married the dashing Mr. Anton -- who is 16 years her senior (based on the ages of the actors portraying these characters; Bergman was 28 when she made the film; Boyer was 44) -- that Gregory had a conniving little scheme up his devious sleeve the whole time; a scheme to slowly but surely drive the new Mrs. Anton out of her mind. It's a story that's been done before in the cinema, to be certain; but ""Gaslight"" sends this plotline to a different (and better) plateau. It plays out very nicely and effectively in this film. And you gotta love Ingrid in the final act when she confronts her plotting husband. She's just great here, in a terrific finale to the picture.

Bergman and Boyer are both just right for their parts here; and I doubt if Miss Bergman ever looked better through the probing camera's eye than she does in her many close-ups in ""Gaslight"". She is simply ravishing on screen in this motion picture. The supporting cast is ideal as well, including the always-first-rate Joseph Cotten, plus Dame May Whitty in a humorous role as a neighborhood busybody, and Angela Lansbury in her very first movie role (she turned 18 while the film was being made).

""Gaslight"" did quite well in the ""Oscar"" department too -- earning several Academy Award nominations, including two winning nods (Miss Bergman won her first Oscar trophy for ""Best Actress"" and the film also took the award for ""Best Art Direction""). Boyer and the teenaged Lansbury also received nominations (for ""Best Actor"" and ""Best Supporting Actress"", respectively). Lansbury plays ""Nancy"", a sassy and frisky house servant of the Antons; and she is delightful in the part too.

Set in London, England, in the 1870s, ""Gaslight"" oozes Victorian-era atmosphere, as well as the misty and foggy dampness of London. The set design and costumes, to my eyes, are authentic-looking in all respects. It's filmed in black-and-white, enhancing the movie's oft-times dark and shadowy surroundings all the more.

The film transfer to this Warner Brothers' DVD looks excellent. Very clean and clear, with a pleasing Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono soundtrack as well. Video is in the intended Full-Frame ratio, as it was originally seen in theaters beginning on May 4, 1944.

And for those fans who can't get enough ""Gaslight"", WB has even included the entire 1940 U.K. version of the movie on Side B of this dual-sided DVD. So, this disc is literally a ""Gaslight Double-Feature"". The '40 version (also a B&W film) stars Anton Walbrook and Diana Wynyard in the two leads. I'm partial to the U.S. adaption of the film done four years later; but the 1940 variant has many die-hard supporters as well. A tip of the cap to Warner's DVD division for seeing fit to place both versions of the movie on the very same Digital Disc.

And WB didn't stop there either -- in addition to the second full-length movie on Side B of the disc, some other nice extra features are presented here too. .... There's a 13.5-minute featurette entitled ""Reflections On Gaslight"", hosted by Ingrid Bergman's daughter. Angela Lansbury is also on hand to provide a few personal insights about her first-ever experience on a movie set. A nice little featurette, with several behind-the-camera ""Gaslight"" tidbits being revealed.

Other DVD bonus items include an Academy Awards Newsreel (1:31 in length), where we get to see three Oscars being awarded for 1944 excellence, with awards being handed out to Ingrid Bergman, Bing Crosby, and 8-year-old Margaret O'Brien. Very good video quality on this short extra, too. ... And there's also the Theatrical Trailer for the 1944 edition of ""Gaslight"" (1:53).

More DVD data ..... The Main Menus are not animated, but do feature underlying theme music from the film. ... Three Subtitle options available (English, Spanish, and French). ...

--------------

1944's ""Gaslight"" works very nicely as a thriller, a suspense drama, a love story, and a murder mystery. No matter which specific category you want to slide the movie into, there's one label that can be placed above all others when categorizing it (the one that makes this motion picture a sheer joy to watch time and time again) -- ""Classic"". With this cast of actors, how could it be anything else? So turn down the (gas)lights in the living room, and then turn on ""Gaslight"" on DVD.",1132444800,27,5348,4.8766519823788546
397625,5,6301969316,"GASLIGHT is a first-rate psychological suspense thriller which features the passionate Academy Award-winning performance of Ingrid Bergman in the role of Paula Alquist Anton, a young, fragile wife who is slowly being manipulated into a state of near-insanity by her sinister new husband Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer).

Having been traumatized by the murder of her aunt, the opera singer Alice Alquist, 10 years previously in London, Paula Alquist has been living and studying music in Italy in the years since that tragedy. It is there that she meets and impulsively marries the pianist Gregory Anton. Guided by Anton's wishes, the young couple moves back to London and back into the townhouse where the murder occurred. For the first time in 10 years, Paula declares to Anton, she is no longer afraid: ""you've cast out fear for me...I've found peace in loving you. I could even face that house with you...Yes, yes, you shall have your dream. You shall have your house in the square."" Yet, the townhouse still haunts her somewhat and, when her husband begins hinting about her forgetfulness (""You know, you are inclined to lose things, Paula"") and seems to purposefully arrange situations which give him the opportunity to admonish her and treat her as an irresponsible child, she slowly begins to believe that she is losing her mind.

Joseph Cotten plays Brian Cameron, the Scotland Yard detective who has begun looking into the cold murder case of Alice Alquist after encountering Paula and Anton on one of their rare outings and having been struck by the resemblance between Paula and her famously beautiful aunt. His presence seems to accelerate Anton's malevolent campaign against his wife; he conspires to keep her home-bound and away from all social connections. Soon, he begins leaving Paula alone in the house every night, and she is tormented by the eerily dimming gaslights and the strange noises and footsteps she imagines around the house. A very young Angela Lansbury (in her first film role) plays the tarty, insolent maid Nancy, who is devoted to Anton and is openly contemptuous toward the increasingly fragmented Paula.

Through the expressionistic black and white cinematography of Joseph Ruttenberg, the Academy Award-winning art direction of Cedric Gibbons, and under the taut direction of George Cukor, GASLIGHT evokes a heavy mood of Victorian-era suspense set in the hoary mansions and foggy streets of London. As Cameron meets Paula and the mystery unravels itself in a thrilling finale, one feels as if one were watching Alfred Hitchcock in one of his finest moments. Cukor did a truly fantastic job in a genre that was largely unfamiliar to him and GASLIGHT remains one of the finest gothic suspense thrillers ever made.

Years earlier Boyer had murdered Bergman's aunt for jewels she owned, but he was never able to find them. When he learns that Bergman has inherited the aunt's house, he turns on the charm, gets her to marry him, and moves into the house with her. On the pretense of going to a room every night to write music, he sneaks upstairs to the attic, which has been sealed off, to search for the jewels. Meanwhile he torments Bergman, hoping to have her committed to a madhouse after he finds the jewels. But thanks to Joseph Cotton and Scotland Yard, all comes right in the end. Both Boyer and Bergman are excellent (Bergman took the Oscar), and they bring off the very tense climax powerfully.

397638,5,6301969316,"Cukor's GASLIGHT has been thought of as an anomaly in his career, the one fi;lm of his which might honestly been mistaken for a Hitchcock thriller.

Perhaps some of this confusion is set off by the presence of Bergman, one of Hitchcock's favorite actresses (""It's only a movie, Ingrid"") together with Joseph Cotten, with whom Hitchcock teamed Bergman in the later UNDER CAPRICORN.  The ""one word title"" of GASLIGHT is also reminiscent of how many one word titles Hitchcock employed over the years.  Cotten and Bergman (as well as Hitchcock) were contracted to the former MGM head of production David O Selznick, who was making SINCE YOU WENT AWAY (also with Joseph Cotten) at the same time that Cukor was shooting GASLIGHT, so that Cotten was available to him only in the evenings.

For an MGM release in 1944 GASLIGHT is oddly bereft of MGM stars!  Angela Lansbury made her debut here, but where are the other MGM notables?  We know that during the war many of MGM's leading men were tied up in the service, but were there many MGM releases in 1944 in which none of the three leading players were under studio contract?  I don't think so!  This is definitely an odd duck among MGM's wartime films.

We have also long known that this was a remake of an older British film made by the esteemed director Thorold Dickinson, and some have cattily assumed that Cukor stole all of Dickinson's directorial flourishes in a paint by numbers Gus Van Sant does Psycho kind of carbon copy of the original.  This DVD shows us both films side by side, and at last we can all judge for ourselves.  I like Diana Wynyard, who's very good in the Dickinson GASLIGHT-she has a very different style than Bergman, but both are quite effective.  Isn't the time ripe for a full scale Wynyard revival?  Let's see her make a comeback via DVD!

Paula, the name of Ingrid Bergman's character, is a favorite name of Cukor's.  Viewers will recall that the young society girl caught up in a destructive affair with drunken rouse John Barrymore in DINNER AT EIGHT was also called ""Paula.""  And later on in life, perhaps, this fondness would explain why Cukor allowed Paula Strasberg onto the set of the film SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE, to coach the insecure Marilyn Monroe, with Cukor's compliance.",1114732800,5,2263,4.691139240506329
397639,4,6301969316,"Set in the 1870s when the lighting in English households was powered by gas--hence the title--this psychological mystery worked as a diversion from the constant presence of the war for the American public when it was released in 1944.  Starring the incomparable Ingrid Bergman (Paula) in an Oscar-winning role as a woman who marries a dark, handsome and mysterious man (Charles Boyer) only to fall prey to his desire to drive her mad and steal her jewels, Gaslight remains one of director George Cukor's many triumphs.

Joseph Cotton, Dame May Whitty, and Angela Lansbury (in her debut at seventeen as a saucy parlor maid) lent strong support.  I was particularly delighted with the busybody Whitty, who was born in 1865 and had made her film debut at the age of 49.  Here she is rapid-fire sure and feisty at age 78, and funny, both intentionally and unintentionally--or I should say that Whitty turned otherwise prosaic lines into little bits of delight.  I also recall her in Hitchcock's Brit classic The Lady Vanishes (1938) in which she had the title role. The interesting thing is that in both movies Whitty meets the young star on a train (Margaret Lockwood there, and Bergman here) and they become friends--well, here their friendship is a bit difficult for Bergman's character for reasons that will become clear when you see the movie.

Some of this will seem familiar, especially the somewhat idiotic idea that a man may drive his wife crazy by playing nasty little tricks on her, such as taking down pictures and hiding them, or dimming the gaslights, or walking like a ghost above her bedroom.  And the treatment may be a bit leisurely for today's audiences.  However this movie is very carefully constructed with plausible twists of plot and some fine foreshadowing.  Boyer is almost comical in his machinations at times, mad with jewel lust and syrupy smooth by turns.

A good reason to see this black and white classic is to compare how past-master Cukor features his leading ladies.  He also directed Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady (1964), Judy Garland in A Star Is Born (1954) and Katharine Hepburn in Adam's Rib (1950) and Pat and Mike (1952) to name a famous few.  One thing is clear, for several decades if you were a leading actress, being in a George Cukor film was an opportunity not to be missed.

But see this for Ingrid Bergman.  She dominates the movie with her exquisite beauty and her oh so expressive countenance in one of her more demanding roles.  The famous, beguiling Bergman smile however is not much in evidence since her character is so long-suffering and passive--and this too may try the patience of today's audiences.  You may find yourself wanting to say to Paula, ""Get a backbone,"" ""Live a little"" and ""Get rid of that rake!""  But fear not.  Paula does eventual get back at her oppressor culminating in a (somewhat implausible, but nonetheless agreeable) scene near the end where he is tied up and begging her to get a knife and cut him free...",1110758400,2,2986,4.776264591439689
397640,5,6301969316,"""Gaslight"" (the 1944 version) is one of the best suspense classics I can think of that's not directed by Hitchcock, and the casting was simply flawless. Ingrid Bergman gives a excellent performance as a naive young woman (""Paula"") who's nearly driven insane by her sinister, greedy husband, ""Gregory"" (played by Charles Boyer). Joseph Cotten plays the detective who comes to Paula's rescue just when she's almost lost her sanity. It is he who helps Paula finally realize that Gregory had only married her so that he could find very valuable jewels supposedly hidden in her house years ago. Charles Boyer is great even playing such an unlikable villian, and Dame May Whitty along with then 18-year-old Angela Lansbury in her film debut (who was nominated for best supporting actress) add great support to the main stars. This is truly an awesome dvd, and it includes the 1940 British version of ""Gaslight"" as well as a documentary ""Reflections on Gaslight"", the original trailer, and footage of Ingrid Bergman accepting her best actress oscar at the 1944 Academy Awards ceremony! This classic thriller is highly recommended.",1106784000,83,1123,5.108695652173913
397641,3,6301969316,"As a thriller, the 1944 ""Gaslight"" remakes works significantly less well in the 21st century than it did when it was released.  Though it was most certainly the crme de la crme of big-screen chills and in its day, nowadays ""Gaslight"" is just another old-fashioned thriller full of melodrama, shrieking damsels in distress, and somewhat-less-than-surprising plot twists.  Far more thrilling films can easily be found in practically all of Hitchcock's films or even more modern films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" (now who saw that ending coming?)

Bergman portrays a fragile young woman, Paula Alquist, whom, after her aunt is murdered in their London apartment, falls for a piano player, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer) while escaping her grief in Italy.  It soon becomes painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain that Gregory is up to no good.  And his creepily intense interest in the Crown Jewels during a rare visit outside of the house to the Tower of London makes the whole ""mystery"" even more obvious.  We know what kind of man he is, who he is, what he is after, and where the film is going; all within the first thirty minutes.

As Paula slowly succumbs to the cruelty and isolation inflicted upon her by Gregory, it gives Bergman the chance to suffer magnificently.  Whether cowering against the walls, writhing about in agony as Gregory brainwashes her into believing that she is going crazy, starring wild-eyed at the flickering gaslights, trembling with fear at the sight of the housemaids (including a youthful Angela Lansbury), or crying out in anguish at a piano concert, Bergman is so convincingly tortured and unstable that it earned her her first Best Actress Oscar in 1944.

Another part of the problem is that director George Cukor seems content to let Boyer portray Gregory as a one-dimensional, mercilessly cruel man.  This leaves the audience with little to do but watch Paula slowly deteriorate into a shadow of her former self; a jumpy, frightened, emotional mess. There is no subtlety here, and it's rather like watching a bodybuilder kick a puppy for an hour and a half, making ""Gaslight"" an ephemeral and forgettable film.",1106784000,4,2149,4.96100278551532

Gaslight (1940)

What a crisp, deeply rooted thriller Thorold Dickinson created.  With vile creatures (Paul) and goofy policemen and maids, we are easily captured into the world of the Mallens.  Diana Wynyard does a spectacular job as Bella, giving us the right amount of insecurity coupled with fear.  She is the true victim of this film and Dickinson does not let us forget that.  Wynyard is nearly overshadowed by my favorite character of the film, Paul Mallen, played with so much evil by Anton Walbrook.  I have seen several films in my life, and I must say that Walbrook ranks amoung some of the most sinister villains of them all.  He has no super powers, just the ability to manipulate Bella mentally, proving that he is stronger than her.  He thrives on Bella's insecurities and makes them into his greatest form of punishment.  These two working together really transformed this 40s thriller into something concrete and powerful.  It is the dynamic between the two that kept me glued to my seat and continually asking for more.

Coupled with the superb acting is the creativeness of Dickinson and his writer A.R. Rowlinson.  Together they set the mood with darkened corners and alleyways with that constantly looming feeling that the events are going to get grittier down the road.  This team made Victorian London a spooky place to visit at night.  They make Bella the victim throughout this entire film, making even me wonder if she really was slowly going mad.  It isn't until the end that the truth is revealed and even then we are left in suspense.  It isn't until the credits roll is the film over, and that is hard to accomplish for directors of the thriller genre today.  Dickinson proved that he could handle all the elements with the greatest of ease and bring them to the screen in a film that would last the test of time.  I am not embarrassed to show this film to friends because I do believe that they would see the value in this production.

Grade: ***** out of *****

Gaslight (1944)

This remake was the epitome of Hollywood's hands in the cookie jar.  Instead of leaving a masterpiece at rest, the studio chose to remake this film only four years after the original was released and completely butchered it.  To begin, they brought too many bigger named stars into the picture.  Ingrid Bergman overacted her part as Paula Alquist, bringing Hollywood insanity to the screen instead of this feeling of real fear or insecurity.  Also troubling is the role of her husband, played by Charles Boyer, who never quite gets that slimy taste in your mouth like Walbrook did.  He is acting, and you can tell from the moment that he opens his mouth on screen.  Add in one of the maids played by Angela Lansbury (of Murder, She Wrote notoriety) and you have a literal Hollywood remake equation.  We have all seen this before, more money = bigger actors + bigger publicity + more chances for Oscars.  Boy, did this equation work well for Bergman.  She was awarded an Oscar for her portrayal (and nearly everyone else was nominated for their parts) of Paula, which to me seemed like nothing more than overacting to get that feeling of ""insanity"".  There was no reality to her performance, and sadly should not have been awarded.

Watching these two back to back you really see how Hollywood the 1944 version became.  It became even more apparent when there was more stories added to build character depth.  The beginning where Paula is related to the murders and the subplot dealing with how her and Charles Boyer met was hysterical.  It was unnecessary and a waste of time.  The original did not carry these scenes and it was better, wouldn't you think that studio bosses would want to keep a good idea instead of turning it to mush?  These added scenes and mixture of events only created a jumbled mess that was harder for me to follow than really enjoy.  With so much excitement after watching the original, this was very difficult to watch.  Director Cukor never captured that eeriness of the gaslight or the darkness of London as well as Dickinson was able to.  Cukor was a Hollywood dog following the leash that was given to him by the studio.  It was sad to see these two together and do not suggest this version.  The beauty and innocence coupled with fear and insecurity just wasn't the central theme of this film (as it was with the original) and ultimately it hurt it in the long run.

Identifying Boyer as a murderer is not giving anything away in this movie.  The strength of the movie is in watching this control slowly and steadily take shape.  Knowing the good guys and the bad guy enables us to focus on these developments without being distracted by ""who done it.""  There are some mysteries that are solved during the course of the movie which do add to its'impact.

With a psychological drama such as this, the acting is critical for success.  In this case, the cast is exceptional.  Charles Boyer lokks and acts the part of the evil manipulator.  Ingrid Bergman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of the manipulated wife.  Her descent into bewilderment is impressive to watch.  The movie is well-directed by George Cukor and must have been a big hit in its' day.

I limited my rating to four stars for the same reason I referred to it as a semi-thriller.  I felt that could have been a bit more done to effectuate a greater sense of impending doom.  I previously noted that the strength of the movie lies in its' psychological development.  However, I thought there was room for more suspense.  Knowing ""who done it"" from the start was OK; it was the not knowing who done what or why that I felt could have been better developed.",1102809600,2,1577,4.598566308243727

397722,5,6301969316,"The DVD release of Gaslight is terrific. The inclusion of both film versions is a great treat because both films are definitely worth seeing; perhaps they even deserve a back to back viewing. The 1944 version is somewhat superior because of the casting, but there are some terrific things, storywise, in the 1940 version that fare better.
The plot is simple yet satisfying: An unstable woman and her husband move back into her childhood home, where a murder had taken place years earlier. She slowly begins losing grip on reality and becomes convinced that her husband is trying to drive her insane. Or is he? It adds up to a diabolical, atmospheric thriller, which won Bergman her first, but not last, Oscar.
By today's standards GASLIGHT may be seen as slow-moving and obvious. But no modern film can match this picture's intricate psychology. Beautifully filmed in a gloomy, atmospheric black-and-white, GASLIGHT exhibits all the classic visual elements of '40s film noir. The attention to detail is more obvious than in many modern films and heightens the suspense. The benighted streets of London are cloaked with fog, and the large, lonely house where most of the action takes place, is filled with shadows and strange noises. The paranoid, claustrophobic world of Paula's confinement is also effectively conveyed. This is the kind of effectively-crafted, well-acted motion picture that rises above its faults to earn its ""classic"" appellation. It's a must!",1089504000,6,1463,5.151260504201681

Nothign has changed since she left 10 years ago, but Gregoy persuades her to remove her Aunt's belongings in order to keep those painful memories at bay.  Soon after moving in, though, strange things start to happen.  The gaslights mysteriously dim each night, followed by strange noises coming from the closed off upper floor.

The captivating story of a woman struggling to maintain her sanity is marvelously portrayed on-screen.  Bergman fills her character with  enough frayed nerves and self-doubt that you feel right along with her.

397727,4,6301969316,"I am going to make you believe that you are mad and then push you over the edge of sanity. With those intensions, Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer) sets out to destroy his wife, Paula's (Ingrid Bergman) mental stability in ""Gaslight""(1944). Greg's reasoning? ? Paula?s dead aunt, his former lover, has hidden a fortune in jewels somewhere in the house which Paula now owns. I suppose Greg could have just sent Paula to the music hall to get her out of the way, but then the prospects for high melodrama and intense suspense wouldn?t have been nearly as diabolical or as fun.
The film opens on one of MGM?s spooky and unsettling soundstages, gussied up to look like a typical English square. From one of the brownstones a distraught Paula is taken away, having just discovered her aunt?s horribly mangled body inside. In a state of shock, Paula is sent to Florence where she falls in love with a piano player, Gregory Anton. The two married. Returning to London, Paula and Gregory set up housekeeping in her aunt?s old house. However, not long afterward Paula begins to become increasingly absentminded ? or does she. Priceless antiques are moved, paintings are switched on the walls and a broach belonging to Gregory?s mother vanishes without a trace. Gregory, growing increasingly impatient with Paula?s emerging psychosis (actually he?s upset how long its taking to drive her crazy), leaves her alone each night, presumably to go off and paint portraits (his profession). Actually, he sneaks around the back of their house, reentering from an adjacent attic into theirs to search for the aunt?s missing jewels. The tap, tap, tapping on Paula?s bedroom ceiling and the sudden lowering of gaslights are attributed to figments of Paula?s growing mental instability. To create further doubt, paranoia and suspicion, Gregory hires an upstairs maid, the saucy Nancy (Angela Lansbury in an Oscar nominated role) who delights at taunting Paula with coy flirtations toward Gregory. Deception never looked so good. The melodrama is first rate and the performances will have you applauding in your seat. Joseph Cotten costars as the police investigator who does not believe that all of the mysteries inside Gregory?s home can be attributed to Paula?s failing mental health.
The transfer is rather disappointing.  Though the gray scale is very nicely balanced with black levels that are solid and contrast levels that are fully realized, nothing can eclipse the distracting shimmering effects and edge enhancement that plague many of the scenes throughout this film. Fine details uncontrollably shimmer and thoroughly distract in spots.  The audio is sharp and well balanced.
As part of the extras we are given the original 1940 British version of ""Gaslight"" that, I must tell you, is just as compelling as MGM's remake. In comparing the two versions, MGM?s obvious attention to ultra high gloss glamour becomes instantly obvious. So does the fact that director, George Cukor managed to create an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia in the remake that works well with the subject matter but is wholly lacking in the original. The transfer elements for the British version are much poorer than one might expect but they are by no means awful - leaving you with twice as much sinister fun on this double feature. Contrast and shadows on the British original are poorly balanced but there appears to be no aliasing, shimmering or edge enhancement employed for a far more smooth presentation. There's also a new retro-documentary on both versions that is generally compelling if all too short.",1075420800,,3576,5.090289608177172

For years MGM actively supressed the older film giving rise to the legend that it was a far superior film.  Now finally film buffs can view both and decide for themselves.
Both are terrific movies.  For me, while the British version is leaner and faster, the Cukor film is by far the greater of the two.  The relationship between Walbrook and Wynyard in the 1940 version is a well-played but two dimensional depiction of a tormentor and his victim.  Boyer's and Bergman's characters are more complex and subtle in the 1944 film.  There is a genuine romantic/sexual energy between them.  While Boyer is sinister he also very charming and attractive. And you watch as the once-vibrant Bergman gives up her self confidence and becomes emotionally dependent on Boyer a little bit at a time.  And what can you say about the amoral delinquent maid of Angela Lansbury?  That alone is worth the price of admission!

397760,4,6301969316,"""Gaslight"" is an above average suspense/murder mystery. There are far more strong points than weak. It is seriously recommended to old/serious movie fans, albeit with a few definite reservations. The former include the two leads- Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman, playing husband and wife. Both are excellent.  The film opens just as her aunt has been murdered in her London townhouse. A very young Bergman is forced to move to Vienna, where she falls in love with a music teacher, none other than Boyer. Somewhat too conveniently, they return to London and surprise (!) discover that the same old townhouse is for sale. They move back in to the murder locale. At this point, the reservations come to the surface as GL starts to telegraph that Boyer is ""up to something"". The honeymoon ends.  Joseph Cotton enters the film as a very (!) Americanized Scotland Yard Detective. It seems he originally investigated the murder of the aunt. His superior officer at the Yard orders him not to reopen the case but he defies his boss and does exactly that! Cotton's key role is the weakest link in GL. It is difficult to accept an American detective midst all the Europeans and harder still to swallow his direct defiance of his boss. Would a true SY detective be so brazen? Furthermore, Cotton's ""discoveries"" are a tad too slick. GL also over-portrays Boyer as a ""somewhat less than loving husband"", when that fact is patently plain.  Finally, GL's stage origins shine through. This was obviously NOT filmed within 5,000 miles of London but on a studio lot. That ""mansion"" was cobbled together by the Hollywood Carpenters local! The ""pea soup"" background is laughable, though the gloomy black and white film serves the story well. Why then, is GL recommended? This reviewer believes that the two leads are so strong that they support the movie themselves. Most seem to praise Bergamn since she plays the sympathetic role of the abused wife. What a jerk she was married to! And indeed, Hollywood gave her the Best Actress Oscar. This reviewer favors the evil, smarmy, slimy, manipulative Boyer as the strongest element of GL. Together this mismatched husband and wife elevate ""Gaslight"" to a serious suspense movie, just short of a ""classic"". For the record, both Mr. Boyer and the movie itself lost Oscar races to Bing Crosby and ""Going My Way"". I guess the wartime United States could not get too serious over movies. This reviewer doesn't divulge endings although it may already be obvious. The resolution is not the key.

397765,5,6301969316,"George Cukor, whose name is synonymous with so-called women's movies directed this tightly knit psychological Victorian gem of a thriller. On the surface it is not a complicated premise. Young Paula Alquist, played by beautiful Ingrid Bergman is sent away Italy to finish her schooling after her famous aunt is found murdered in her home. The murderer was never found. Nor were the jewels she was rumored to have.
Fast forward years later. Paula has fallen in love with charming and dashing Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer). She marries Anton and they return to her aunt's house which is now Paula's by inheritance. Paula cannot see it, but the audience sees that her husband's charm is quickly fading as he isolates her from their social circle under the guise that she is ill and cannot see anyone. He manipulates her to the point that she is fears that she is losing her mind.  The viewer watches Ingrid Bergman's character change from an intelligent, secure young woman to a paranoid recluse slowly being driven mad by her husband who skillfully controls her mind. By now we have learned that it is no coincidence that Gregory Anton, met, married and convinced Paula to return to London to live in her former home. He is determined to continue his search for the jewels which was interrupted by Alice Alquist years ago.
As Paula struggles with her sanity, she has no one to turn to for help until an inquisitive neighbor, Miss Thwaites (Dame May Witty) elicits help from Brian Cameron (Joseph Cotton) who happens to be a Scotland Yard detective. Cameron has his own reasons for being curious about the never seen Paula Alquist. Be sure to watch for a very young Angela Lansbury as the cute tartish young maid who has eyes for Boyer.
Gaslight is one for those movies that you can again and again and still have it give you the shivers as you watch Boyer skillfully and cunningly drive his wife to the brink of insanity. But Bergman's revenge is sweet. A brilliant movie.

Try to say that like Charles Boyer. If you succeed, I'll give you a penny for your success in imitating the inimitable. I'd give you a dime but I don't have a dime. I think Gregory Anton is hiding my money someplace and planning to make me think I did it.
This isn't Hitchcock, but it could have been, because it is so very suspenseful and artistic with never a dull moment. The cast consists primarily of the murderous husband, the wife going nuts, the cuckoo neighbour across the street who loves diggie biscuits and chats with pigeons, a maid with attitude, and the detective with the pretty hair who comes just in time to save the day and maybe a few lives too.
This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, but keep in mind it is also a very nerve-wracking film and defnitely NOT to be watched if you are trying to be calm or relieve stress.

397768,5,6301969316,"With great performances by Charles Boyer, Oscar Winner Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten, ""Gaslight"" is one of the best thrillers of the `40's and indeed of all time. It proves to us that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to people, but also to any other situation. It also asks us if we know the ones we trust (Some plot spoilers).
The story is of a married couple: Paula (Bergman) and Gregory Anton (Boyer). Paula's aunt, a famous performer named Alice Alquiest, was murdered ten years before in her house while Paula was there. Now, her and Gregory have come to live in that same house in Thornton square. Whenever Gregory goes to work on evenings, Paula begins to hear sound up in the attic and the gas always goes down. Though he does some suspicious acts, she doesn't suspect that Gregory is obsessed with locating her aunt's jewels. But Gregory convinces Paula that she is ill and devises a plan to systematically drive her mad. Only when a Scotland Yard Inspector (Cotten) reopens the Alquiest case does the truth unravel. But will Paula still keep her sanity?
In addition to the three leads, there is also supporting work from Dame May Whitty, Barbara Everest and Angela Lansbury, in her screen debut. The cinematography is also very well done and allows us to venture into Paula's isolation and heightens the mood and suspense. The art direction also won an Oscar and Boyer was nominated for his despicable character.

397799,5,6301969316,"(...) This classic Victorian thriller's plot mechanism of a man trying to drive his wife mad definitely squeaks, but as a study in mental cruelty, this film has lost none of its power. Based on Patrick Hamilton's play ""Angel Street"" (which, by the way, starred Vincent Price and Judith Evelyn, later to co-star in ""The Tingler""!), ""Gaslight"" was filmed previously in England in 1939. I myself haven't seen the British film, and have heard differing opinions on which film is superior, but I definitely love the 1944 version. I'll give a brief summary of the plot for the uninitiated. Alice Alquist, famed opera diva, was strangled, presumably for her famous jewels, and the murderer was never caught. Her teenaged niece, Paula, who lived with her, is taken to Italy for a presumably better life. The murderer is suave Gregory Anton, (Charles Boyer), a pianist who romances and weds Paula some ten years later, and persuades her to return to London and to live in her late aunt's house. He then proceeds to drive his vulnerable young wife mad, isolating her from other people, telling her that she loses and forgets things, and so on. Greedy Gregory goes out in the evenings, enters the attic by way of the roof, and proceeds to hunt for Alice Alquist's jewels, presumably hidden amongst all of her stored possessions. The gaslight in Paula's room goes down, and she hears footsteps and noises, which Gregory tells her are figments of her imagination. Gregory persists in psychologically battering Paula to a near-breaking point, and suspicious Scotland Yard detective Brian Cameron (played by an underrated Joseph Cotten) becomes Paula's savior, and Gregory is apprehended and taken away. The plot mechanism does creak and is definitely shopworn by today's standards, but the production and performances are first-rate. What can I say about Ingrid Bergman that hasn't already been said? Blessed with one of the loveliest ""natural"" faces seen on screen, a voice that could melt your heart, and a remarkable talent, she was something else. One scene in particular really sums up where this film's power lies. Charles Boyer (so silkily villainous) whispers to Miss Bergman ""My watch is missing"" in the middle of a recital, looks in her purse (he planted it there), and Miss Bergman begins to sob uncontrollably. I shudder just thinking about this scene! I've borne witness to similar behavior in real life, and know people who have been in manipulative relationships, so this rings very true to me. But, back to the rest of the cast. A 17 year old Angela Lansbury made her screen debut in this film as a tartish Cockney maid, kicking off a long and great career, and the wonderful Dame May Whitty as an inquisitive neighbor is a delight. The cinematography is lush and moody, the costumes and sets are superb, full of rich detail (one forgets thats these are just sets and not a ""real"" house), and an ominous score by Bronislau Caper add to this handsome production. In closing, I have to state again how much I admire Ingrid Bergman. The lady was a class act, and in spite of her loveliness, never viewed herself as a ""glamour puss"". She just wanted to be a great actress, and she certainly more than succeeded, winning her first Academy Award for this film. I'll take Sweden!",1014768000,7,3274,4.869175627240144
397800,4,6301969316,"This is a classic and it has not aged one iota, even if it is a victorian crime story. The construction of the plot is slow and very cautious to build up a suspense that does not suffer with multiple viewing. The actor and actress are great in their parts and they really show in their behaviors and expressions the deep disquieting situation. The general lesson of such a film is that no one can trust anyone when diamonds are at stake. All is good for the  vulture  who wants the diamonds to recuperate them and the woman who is taken up in that machination becomes a tool that can be discarded any time if it helps the objective of the criminal. But it is also very moral because Scotland Yard is looking after you and you can trust them to do anything they can to protect you. Of course it is an old film without any special effects but the acting is so good that we can forget those elements of modernity that generally do not add anything to a film except more visual elements that replace the acting of the actors. Here the whole film is founded on this excellent acting. It was  a time when actors were the very center of films, and these do it marvellously.

Gaslight is the earliest of Bergman's works I have seen.
We know from studies on facial expression and nonverbal communication that the face is difficult to read because of the rapidity of movement of the many features of the face...eyes, mouth, checks, chin. But I swear, watching this film makes me believe that Bergman could command the movement of her hair folicles and skin pores. There are facial movements in this film that absolutely cannot be seen with the naked eye. It appears that she has not moved a muscle yet she has conveyed a powerful emotion.

397803,5,6301969316,"Director George Cukor's Gaslight is a wonderful mystery suspense in the Alfred Hitchcock tradition.  And where Hitchcock had trouble with mastery over period dramas, Cukor excelled.  The set decoration and camera work are extraordinary and the performances are all on target.  Another reason this film has a Hitchcock feel is due to the fact that two of Hitchcock's most popular players, Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotton, star.  Bergman stars as Paula Alquist, a shy young woman, whose only surviving relative was brutally murdered when she was a teenager.  Bergman's aunt, Alice Alquist was a famous opera singer and as the movie begins, we find Bergman studying voice in Italy.  Accompanying her on the piano is the suave and sophisticated Charles Boyer, the object of Bergman's affections.  Distracted by this new love in her life,  Bergman gives up her studies and runs off and marries Boyer.  All seems wonderful until Boyer convinces Bergman that they should return to her home in London, the very place where her aunt was murdered.  Bergman is reluctant, but gives in to please her new husband.  Unknown to Bergman, however, is the fact that Boyer murdered her aunt looking for some very expensive, but hidden jewels.  His obsession in finding them goes so far as to convince Bergman that she is on the brink of insanity.  Cotton enters the scene as a sympathetic Scotland Yard inspector, and a fan of Bergman's late aunt.  He is convinced that the mystery surrounding Alice Alquist's murder is somewhere in that house, and he also suspects Boyer.  Bergman shines in her first Academy Awarding winning performance.  Hers is a delicate, well balanced tour de force that draws the viewer in and makes us sympathize and pull for her to triumph.  As the diabolical husband, Boyer is properly menacing and cruel, carefully orchestrating Bergman's descent into madness.  With all this talent and star power in one film, Gaslight couldn't help but be a masterpiece.  Gaslight is also noteworthy for 17-year-old Angela Landsbury's film debut as the saucy maid Nancy.  With all the polish and resources of the MGM film factory at its peak, Gaslight is superb in every way.  Wonderful entertainment.",976579200,40,2196,5.044444444444444
397804,4,6301969316,"Perhaps it was my imagination, but I seem to have felt myself slipping into the ""Twilight Zone"" while being completely absorbed in this movie.  Ingrid Bergman won a well deserved Academy Award in this psychological thriller from 1944.  Charles Boyer and Angela Lansbury were both nominated for their devious but stylish performances.  The film was also nominated for best screenplay and cinematography.  Even with all this going for it, ""Gaslight"" has become somewhat dated (through no fault of its own), and a bit tedious at times.  But make no mistake about it,  ""Gaslight"" is old fashioned storytelling at its best!  It's 100 percent gothic romance!  What more could you ask for than distinctly Victorian flavor in a Victorian London setting?  If you answered, ""relentless tension,"" your wish has been granted!  The script is clever, and the atmosphere haunting.  Just one flaw: A disappointing conclusion to an otherwise exquisite production.  However, as the end approaches, you may be mentally drained and exhausted to the point where just one more plot twist could have put you over the edge.  And what a great, and oh so appropriate title!  I will buy the DVD, and watch it again, and again, and again.",970099200,11,1210,5.015075376884422
397805,4,6301969316,"Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman star in this chilling and creepy drama of a woman slowly driven to madness in her London home - the same house where  her aunt was murdered. Boyer and Bergman are both excellent, and the foggy  London atmosphere is perfect. Only caveat - Joseph Cotten, playing a  British detective with an American accent !",966384000,2,340,4.728813559322034
397806,5,6301969316,"I've loved Gaslight since I first saw it 15 years ago, and recently ordered it from a video company in Britain. THough I ordered the Hollywood version, it was unavailable and they sent the British version instead.  Interesting, but almost completely lacking in the psychological drama and  suspense of the Bergman/Boyer version, mostly because from the very start,  it's made clear that the husband is lying to his wife about all the  disappearances.  So this is one time Hollywood got it right--Bergman and  Boyer bring a tension to the film that sizzles off the screen and Lansbury  is wonderfully devious in her film debut.  A must see!",945129600,2,639,4.906542056074766

7818707,5,6301969316,"Recently, I was in a conversation and recalled the origin of the concept of ""gaslighting"" which has been in the news lately.  Psychological manipulation is explored in this story, where a husband gradually convinces his wife that she is going insane.  She is sure she is seeing things, many things. For example she saw the gas lights dim, but he assures her that the lights have remained steady none of the things she is talking about have actually happened.  Will she find out what is really happening before its too late?  One can see why this movie was nominated for so many academy awards. This is a psychological thriller.  I suppose in 1944 it felt much like today's thrillers, such as ""The Girl On The Train"",  ""Gone Girl"" and ""Before I go to Sleep"".  If you can look past the datedness, this is worth watching at least once. I find that even with the passage of time, it is still a disturbing piece that will leave you paranoid for a few minutes after you're done watching it.",1522195200,,984,4.52542372881356
