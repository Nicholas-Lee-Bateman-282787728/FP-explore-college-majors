The show is not bad, there are genuinely funny situations however, the supporting cast is not very strong.  However, the biggest difference between this show and shows like curb your enthusiasm or the office is that the main character rick spleen is so genuinely unlikable that you find yourself not caring what happens or becoming emotionally invested.  He is so irritated by everyone and everything.  I can't find anything that makes me like this person, in fact.  He is hate-able, and not in any kind of funny way.  I've watched the first two seasons so far and there hasn't been one instance of any kind of humanity in him at all.  This show attempts to follow the same formula as curb but falls way short of the mark.",1307232000,,882,4.7631578947368425
8346926,5,B001W4FJW2,"This is very funny program.  I fell in love with it while living in the UK.  Jack Dee is a popular comedian with a cynical, sardonic style.  The characters in Lead Balloon are so well developed and the acting is superb.  I wanted to point out that many PCs will allow you to view a British video.....sometimes you may need to ""commit"" a home PC or laptop to Region 1 DVDs (so you would no longer view US/Region 2 DVDs on it).  I love British programming, so I am happy to do this and just use my home PC for British DVD viewing and my standard DVD player to watch my American DVDs.  Just a useful tip!",1239321600,,601,4.094017094017094
