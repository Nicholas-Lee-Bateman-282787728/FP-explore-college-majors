8059989,1,B0009F7LXU,"Ordered this film on Netflix.  It's all footage from the 1980's, very poorly done.  The $24.95 price is laughable.  This DVD is appallingly bad.",1319068800,,144,4.916666666666667
8059990,1,B0009F7LXU,"Entitled Guide to California and San Francisco, spends about 1 minute talking about San Fran.  Jumps from one area of California to another, the video gives each place a cursory overview, lasting about one minute each.  Amateurish and superficial; it's incredibly difficult to believe this video came out in 2005.  It has the look and feel of a much older video, something I might have seen in school when I was young, and that was a very long time ago.  Can you tell I was disappointed in this purchase?  Planning a trip and this was totally useless.  Sigh.",1150416000,4,558,4.642857142857143
