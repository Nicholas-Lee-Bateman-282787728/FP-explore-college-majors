2073147,3,B0002A6UZW,"This video does not meet Leslie's usual high quality. The music is not up to par and the sound fades in and out, which is very distracting. At one point, it is difficult to hear the music at all. The routine is short but by using hand weights, Leslie manages to create a more intense workout in 20 minutes.",1117238400,3,306,4.203389830508475
2073148,5,B0002A6UZW,"I have several of Leslie Sansone walking DVDs.  I hesitated in buying this 1 mile workout since it is so short, but got it to complete my Power Series.

This DVD is great! - except it is only 1 mile.  Leslie - make this a 2 or 3 mile workout!!  It really gets you moving and it is very upbeat.  You just get cruising and bam!  It's over.  I don't know why they didn't just make it a 2 mile walk, then it would be 30 minutes like the other 2 DVD's in the series.

I do this DVD before doing some of the toning tapes that I own.  I really, really, really wish this was a longer workout!!  If so, it would be my favorite.",1115078400,6,618,3.8333333333333335
2073149,5,B0002A6UZW,"There is always time for a healthy body. ~Leslie Sansone

In the time it takes to fold laundry you could have walked a mile. In fact, I often fold laundry at the start of this workout because all you are doing is walking and you can very easily walk in place and fold towels all at the same time. Later in the workout Leslie presents creative challenges by using hand weights for use while moving your arms in circles. The weights are used to shape the upper body while you keep walking and toning the lower body.

If you have 20 minutes, you can walk your way to a new body 20 minutes at a time. Although, I mostly like to use this workout when I'm warming up for Yoga or Pilates. The energetic pace warms your body and the cool-down section and very brief stretching makes this perfect for a ""before-other-workouts"" walk.

Leslie doesn't specialize in complex dance steps, nor does she encourage you to push yourself too hard. Her casual, yet motivational approach helps you get into exercising and stick with a fitness program. She keeps the steps simple with moving side to side or
just walking in place, lifting one knee at a time or kicking straight out in front of you. I think the point with her workouts is to get your body moving. If you are looking for complex and challenging footwork, you won't find it here.

If you add this workout to one of Leslie's Pilates or Yoga workouts you can extend your calorie burning to an hour or more. Looking for more of a challenge? The 3-mile walk is still my all-time favorite. I love the Leslie workouts because she puts me in a good mood and all her workouts are very positive.

2073150,5,B0002A6UZW,"I bought this and Walk and Jog. They were my first two DVD's of Leslie's, I must say that I love both of them. This workout with 3.5 lb hand weights gives you a great quick workout. I have also done the routine back to back for a wonderful two mile power walk. The addition of weights really gets your heart rate going.",1113350400,4,319,4.079365079365079
2073151,5,B0002A6UZW,THIS IS A GREAT ONE MILE WORKOUT. I HAVE A LOT OF LESLIE SANSONE DVDs AND TAPES AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES. IT'S THE FASTEST MOVING ONE MILE WORKOUT YET. IT IS SIMILAR TO THE MUSCLE MILE ONE MILE TAPE BUT IT MOVES A LOT FASTER. THE MOVES ARE VERY SIMPLE TO FOLLOW AND THE USE OF WEIGHTS ARE BENEFICIAL. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.,1106179200,10,336,3.8840579710144927
2073152,5,B0002A6UZW,"I like this video for the reason that it gets you to start an exercise program if you cannot make the time in your busy schedule and around your families sports activities. I like this exercise video because she has you start out with a warm-up slow walk and then increases the speed of having you walk a little more intense. In the mean time she works with her walk-away the pounds water weights which also you can purchase them at a Amazon or Target stores. She does some good upper back exercises,arm curls, arm circles with the weights while you continue your increased pace walk. Also at the end she slows down the walk again for cool down along with some stretching exercises. I feel I get my 2-mile walk in this one mile. I feel that I am toning more muscles by using the weights and the increased paced walk. I have Leslie's complete walk away the belt set and the one mile was too easy! Sometimes it is nice to have a quick workout on hand that you feel is doing some benefit rather than not doing a workout at all if you are a busy person. If you really want to be on a faster weight loss program, I highly recommend her 3 or 4 mile walk-away the pounds DVD's when you can make the time to do so or have worked your self up to doing a longer workout. This one does get you motiviated to start an exercise program with out an excuse that you do not have time or it's too hard!",1106092800,11,1385,4.152416356877324
2073153,3,B0002A6UZW,I like leslie but this 1 mile is different from the rest of her workouts. This tape has more of a set for a back ground unlike her other tapes. She only walks with 2 other people and even though its a power mile its the same as all the other 1 mile walks. She does add weights during a large portion of the workout. I can't recomend this one. But walk away the pounds/abs/express all have good 1 mile workouts.,1105401600,8,410,4.074074074074074
2073154,2,B0002A6UZW,"I have the older walk away the pounds from 2001. I feel like the originals had a better set & were more entertaining. I liked that leslie talked to the group as they walked.

2073160,5,B0002A6UZW,"I really enjoyed this program. The instructor isn't that phony overly enthusiastic type. She's energetic and positive but doesn't presume you don't know how to walk. There was enough variety to not feel like you're marching in place for 20 minutes, but it was easy to follow and keep up. I plan to do this prior to some kind of strength training or pilates. I was surprised that my heart rate was up, I was sweating a little, but I didn't feel winded, shaky or jelly legs. 19 minutes felt like 8-10. I'll stick with it and can't wait to move up to the 2 mile program.",1457568000,2,567,4.308411214953271

If you want a longer workout, do a different DVD.  This is also a good one to introduce you to Leslie if you are new to her program.  My only complaint is she is too worried about figuring out which camera is pointed at her.  Other than that, great DVD.",1451779200,,393,3.9240506329113924

It is ONLY 20 minutes long... AGAIN Great for a beginner.  You can use weights and get your arms involved with the walking.

I NOW use the video as a warm up for my other videos that lack good warm ups.

2073182,5,B0002A6UZW,"Featuring Leslie Sansone and two of her walk instructors (Mary Kay and Beth), Walk Away the Pounds  The Power Mile is one of her older Walk at Home DVDs but is still very efficient. It is a quick walk  about twenty minutes long  perfect for days when you want to exercise but don't have much time. All of her standard moves are here  walking in place, side steps, kicks, knee lifts, hamstring curls, and plenty of upper body movements. What makes this one mile walk so good is the use of weighted balls (I use two pound weighted balls but weighted gloves or even hand weights would also work). Leslie does a great job of incorporating the weights into the workout  you lift the weights over your head, push them in front of you while walking, even do bicep curls while walking. All of this adds a nice bit of intensity to a short walk.

Walk Away the Pounds  The Power Mile is a quick but intense exercise routine that is great to do when you are short on time.",1391472000,2,961,4.305555555555555

2073185,4,B0002A6UZW,"I ordered this DVD from an online vendor and couldn't wait to get it home based on the glowing reviews I read. I've done it once and discovered that, while it is a good DVD, I  disliked the split approach to walking. Instead of walking a straight 5 miles as you can on her 4 mile and 3 mile walks, you have to do a combination of mile segments to get your 5 mile walk in. I also dislike the fact that the belt, stretchie band and hand weights are featured since I have some, but not all, of these items. I know you can walk without them but you won't get as good a workout as with them. I know-I used to own all three before my belt broke. I use HeavyHands weights to replace the ball so I can get an upperbody workout. Overall, the DVD is OK but the 3 mile advanced walking one is my favorite.",1368057600,2,794,3.9625

2073187,3,B0002A6UZW,This is great for beginners. The only issue I have with any of the Leslie Sansone workouts is that the moves are so repetitive that one can get bored easily. I can at most do one of the workouts for 3 weeks before having to switch.

You get the warm-up, the walk and the cool-down on one fast video. There are two other women with Leslie. The choreography is decent. The music is just to keep the beat -- not too loud or too soft as on some DVDs. This is definitely a power walk. You can use weights. You could use the weight belt if you preferred. Of course, you never have to use weights.

Highly recommended.

2073194,5,B0002A6UZW,"This is a short but brisk 1 mile walk with Leslie and company.  I like it a lot, I use it mostly as a warmup to other workouts, but it's perfect for days you don't have much time or are only up to something short.

Leslie is joined by 2 other walkers, you will see all the basic steps here that are in other WATP workouts (marching, kicks, side sides, knee lifts). Weighted balls are used for a good portion of the workout, I don't use the weights as I do other weight lifting, I just do the arm movements without weights, works just fine.

I really like this routine, but I am not sure I would buy it on it's own.  I found it on Leslie's compilation DVD, 5 Day Fit Walk.  I am not sure if it's on any of her other DVDs, though I would highly recommend her compilation DVDs, they are a great value for the money.  That is, if you don't already have one of the workouts on them.

2073206,5,B0002A6UZW,"This fast-paced one-mile walk (20 minutes including warm-up and end stretches) is one of my favorites in the Leslie Sansone series.  For this one she walks against a simple columned backdrop with two other female instructors in coordinating outfits.  For the upper-body exercises she uses her light weighted balls, but I just substitute wrist weights of my own.  I know that some people enjoy Leslie's usual non-stop chatter and laughing with her companions on her videos, but personally I find this one especially pleasant because, though she keeps up a good flow of encouraging words, she makes her voice quiet and soothing, and her companions are smiling but silent.  There is no mileage indicator at the bottom of the screen for this one, but really the mile is completed so quickly you don't notice its absence.  A nice, quick workout for a busy day, and it can be easily done again back-to-back for a good two-mile walk if desired.",1163030400,10,937,4.867924528301887

This one is good for when you don't have time to work out but you need to work some exercise into your day. If you're already in good shape you'll find it somewhat easy, but you can use hand weights/ankle weights the whole time to break a sweat. If you're not in shape, do this every day and you're bound to get there. I recommend Leslie's two mile workout if you're just beginning to workout.

She uses her 4 basic steps and the walk-away weights so it's very easy to follow. My problem is that if I skip a day of exercising, I get lazy and then I ""fall off the wagon"" with my routine.  This walking routine is approximately 20 minutes and it keeps me on track. It's quick, easy, and meets my exercise needs on the days when I just don't have the time or the energy. Leslie gives great instructions and she is easy to follow.  She isn't as chatty on this DVD as some of her others.  The weights are a really nice addition to just plain old walking.  The pace is really good. I have lost weight with Leslie's walking videos and I feel that this DVD is a great addition to my collection.",1156032000,4,858,4.083333333333333
2073209,4,B0002A6UZW,"It's not much of a workout without using the weights, however, when I use my weights with it, it makes for a great, quick morning workout.  It's quick enough to get a good workout every morning before I go to work.  I like the music, as well.  There are a couple of awkward segways during the workout transitioning from one segment to another, but, overall, I liked this video.",1151971200,,377,4.434782608695652
2073210,4,B0002A6UZW,"As many of the other reviewers have said, this walk-workout is short; only about 20 minutes from warm up through cool down.  However, I think that is one of it's best features.

I do this one as a warm up or a follow-up to other workouts.  This is particularly nice after doing yoga or pilates.  It's a super quick arms/legs/cardio workout that you can squeeze in anywhere in your day.  If you want to keep it going you can go back to the beginning and do it again.

I first got this from Netflix to make sure I liked it and would use it, but have now bought a copy.",1142380800,18,566,4.1
2073211,5,B0002A6UZW,"I'm over 50 and haven't exercised in quite a while.  I've always put off exercising because I'd get winded, and bored easily.  This program does not take much time, and it's over before you know it.  I feel terrific afterwards!

The first time I did it I felt aching in my hip joints.  (Probably because of lack of exercise and the extra 30 pounds I'm carrying.)  By the third time the aches where gone and I had a lot more energy.

If you're like me and typically lose interest in exercising about half way through, try this. It's over before you can start thinking ""Gee, I think I'll just sit down and read that magazine, I've done enough for today""",1138752000,10,651,4.375
2073212,5,B0002A6UZW,"I wanted a workout to do at home and since I am pregnant. I tried a lot of prenatal stuff...booooriiiing.  I never did anything more than once except the Power Mile.  It is perfect for getting my heart rate up without exhausting me and it is only 20 minutes long and goes by so fast.  I started doing it without the weights, but now use 5 lb dumbbells (it's the smallest i have) and they work just fine.  I recommend this video to anyone who is trying to get into a routine or who hates high impact workouts.  I still do the workout at least 4 times a week and I am 8 months pregnant.  I already have an order for her other dvds to help me get back in shape after the baby is born.  I LOVE IT!",1137888000,5,693,3.9424460431654675
