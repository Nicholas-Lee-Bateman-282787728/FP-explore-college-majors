8420111,5,B004AFIDPU,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Famous and much beloved series of detective novels featuring the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes has over the years been the subject of many a movie and many TV shows. Many famous actors like Christopher Lee, Basil Rathbone and lately Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey Jr. has portrayed the revered detective. None however more powerfull or authentic than the late Jeremy Brett.

This collection contains all three series starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes: The Adventures Of..... The Casebook Of..... The Return Of.....
This Series may lack the action of so many later interpretations like the blockbuster movies of Robert Downey Jr. or the TV show Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch. No, this is much more intellectual and in some ways much more dramatic. Certainly much more true to the novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who never set out to create an action figure, but rather a brilliant and superior intellect, with the ability to outthink his opponents.

Not only do I believe this show to be the best interpretation of Sherlock Holmes ever created. I also believe Jeremy Brett's interpretation of said character to be the most succesfull, complete and believable ever performed.

In fact the whole show feels very authentic: No CGI or bluescreen here, just the beautiful english countryside, lovely classic buildings and period accurate clothing. This show really proves how few remedies it actually takes to create a convincing illusion.

Guest appearances number such respected actors like John Thaw, Natasha Richardson, Peter Vaughan, Robert Hardy, Josh Ackland ..... ohh and a very young Jude Law, who in a twist of fate much later in his career came to play a very action heavy Dr. Watson to Robert Downey's very action heavy Sherlock Holmes.",1453766400,,1799,5.1931034482758625
