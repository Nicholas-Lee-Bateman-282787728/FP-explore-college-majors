8162926,5,B000LP5D7E,"Notre Dame has been a sentimental fave of mine ever since the days of Lou Holtz and Tony Rice.  Ah, but that was then - this is now.  Poor Notre Dame had the colossal misfortune of being paired with the LSU Tigers for the 2007 Sugar Bowl.

  I can sum up my review of this DVD in two short sentences:  1) LSU is one of the best teams in the NCAA and Notre Dame isn't.  2) LSU has a habit of mauling teams from other conferences.

  While I do sometimes still pull for Notre Dame; on that night I sat in my suburban New Orleans apartment wearing my white LSU jersey and watched as LSU ripped Notre Dame to little pieces before a national audience.  Ah, but that was just the opening act for what Florida would eventually do to Ohio State in the National Championship.

  For those of us who enjoyed seeing LSU mangle another Yankee team, this DVD is a real treat.  I'm buying it to replace the VHS tape I made of the telecast.  If you want to see near perfect execution, this is the game for you (I mean the execution of plays called, not the execution of Notre Dame though that too did happen).  Notre Dame only made one mistake that night; they tied the score (in the second quarter).  That angered LSU and forced the Tigers to repeatedly stomp the poor Golden Domers for the rest of the game.  Final Score:  LSU 41, ND 14.",1191715200,7,1324,4.199203187250996
