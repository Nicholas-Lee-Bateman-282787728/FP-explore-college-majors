I really enjoyed it and I was particularly happy to see Bruce Willis come back with a good action packed adventure. Willis had these roles down to a science. It's some of what he does best. It's a non-stop shoot em up adrenaline rush. The action looks realistic and so does the gritty splattering of carnage.

Yet, there is a deeper side to this film of human suffering and heroics where the humanity shines through what could have been just another action film. The images are powerful and I found Bruce Willis' performance one of his most sincere for a film in this genre. Each subsequent time I see this film it just seems better. The emotionally charged impact is devastating.",1337644800,,871,4.547770700636943
