2994725,5,B000X0GNYE,I really enjoyed every second of this doc.  The fact that this remarkable battle took place and the island itself still has all these remnants of the battle makes me want to make the journey myself despite how treacherous and unhospitibale it is.  Probably won't make it though.  I guess I'll just have to settle for RWBB on my big screen TV.  I highly recommend it.,1207180800,2,366,4.5
2994726,5,B000X0GNYE,"I just graduated from college last May.  I got a minor in history, because it has always interested me.  The funny thing is, I had never read, heard, or was taught anything about this invasion.  It was like it never happened.

My mother for Christmas heard of Red, White, Black, and Blue and bought the DVD for me.  Finally, yesterday on President's Day I watched the doc.  It was so good and for a history doc dealing with war, it wasn't boring, it wasn't slow, and the filming wasn't bad. I was very impressed, because usually you get low quality film making on docs like these.

The film makers on this doc did a great job and made a piece of history come to life.  I don't care what age or sex you are, you will cry several times during this film.  In the end you will be glad you watched and learned something new about your country and what others did for your life.",1203379200,7,872,4.236363636363636
2994727,5,B000X0GNYE,"Just when you thought nothing more could be said on this subject, Putnam and Redecki produce this startlingly lucid ""bio-doc"" on what it means to be an American and the price that comes with being free.  Shot on real video with the actual people that were there, this film takes you were most people will never go:  the island were this movie takes place.  If you like docs about real people and things that are important then this is for you.  Support these guys by buying this movie.  You'll be saying, Yes, I do like this kind of thing and I'm going to spend my money on it to prove it!  What have you got to lose?",1203292800,5,617,4.230769230769231
2994728,5,B000X0GNYE,"I know a good deal about the Second World War but I was unaware of Attu until I saw this film.  I always enjoy learning new things but what made this documentary special is the fact that it is a personal story.  We see the past through the eyes to two very different men who lived it and we are taken on an unpredictable journey with them.

If you are interested in WW II or you just want to see a good doc, check this film out.",1203033600,7,428,3.896551724137931
2994729,5,B000X0GNYE,"As an amateur Aleutian Islands historian, for years I've wondered why no one has made a good film about this important and dramatic battle, and I was thrilled to see that this film does just that.  This film is a great companion to Brian Garfield's seminal book about the War in the Aleutians, The Thousand-Mile War.

It's not quite what I expected, as in addition to telling the story of the battle (which it does quite well) it also has numerous interviews with a veteran named Bill who survived the battle and has had nightmares about it for the past 60 years.  I think that this movie is also one of the best looks I've seen at the tremendous toll that combat takes on the young men who survive it.  The DVD also has quite a bit of ""bonus material"" with more scenes from the film, a slideshow of the island, and some interesting newsreels about the battle from 1943.

I also enjoyed the music in the film and see the soundtrack is for sale here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-White-Black-Blue-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B000X9W790/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red White Black & Blue Motion Picture Soundtrack</a>

2994730,5,B000X0GNYE,"I caught Red White Black and Blue on PBS a few weeks ago and was hoping it would come back on so a WWII-buff friend of mine could see it. It's a totally unique take on a part of the war that I'm embarrassed to say I knew nothing about. I can't believe they teach students about Pearl Harbor but neglect to mention that a WWII battle was actually fought on American soil.

The subject alone is fascinating, but I was especially impressed with the style of the documentary. Some documentaries are too nostalgic or dry & dates-driven... this one really lets you experience what happened through the memories of two of the men who fought on Attu. My grandfather fought in WWII, so I really appreciated how open the two veterans were. They don't hold anything back, and it makes for a much more realistic and haunting portrait of combat and post-combat trauma than I've ever seen.",1202515200,11,875,4.537974683544304

This is one of the most deadly and hardest-fought battles of World War II, yet few know anything about it. The story line is well written and directed, and the two tough 85-year-old veterans and now actors lend so much to making this a great documentary.

2994733,5,B000X0GNYE,"Red, White, Black, and Blue is a great documentary.  I saw this film at a film festival in Boston and was really blown away. The true horific tale of what went on on the Island of Attu with our soldiers against Japan is important to know and learn from.  The film is historically important as well as heart felt.  We watch a man from that battle go back in today's time to visit the battle ground.  Really touching.  War sucks.  I wish all documentaries were this interesting!",1193443200,15,476,4.413793103448276
2994734,4,B000X0GNYE,"I vaguely remember hearing of Japan almost invading parts of the west coast, or maybe it was paratroopers dropping in Oregon, but I've never heard of this occupation of two Aleutian islands before. It was fascinating to learn about. I enjoyed watching it very much.

My only complaints are the editing and video quality (not including the original film footage and photos) were somewhat basic - not really distracting but certainly didn't add to the experience.",1383264000,,461,5.065789473684211

In this film we learn about it from the American veterans of the war. And I give credit to PBS for letting us meet the Japanese survivors of this obscure battle. I recommend it highly.

2994736,3,B000X0GNYE,"though it was of rather minor strategic importance during WW2, i am surprised to hear so many had never even heard of this battle. i myself have come across it quite often in books documenting the history of the war in the Pacific. this documentary does shed light on the extreme hardships of fighting conditions experienced on Attu. the style of this documentary is basically fine, i wouldn't criticize it much. i found myself wishing they had featured fuller interviews with more than just the two US veterans of the battle so as to better offer more varied perspectives. the whole Japanese monument issue dragged on too long and kept popping back up in a discordant fashion (making me wonder ""what is the director's point/agenda?""). i understand the two veterans have their feelings about it, but it didn't make any sense to me beyond the scope of their own traumatic experiences. would they like future generations to keep inheriting an anger perpetuated? the claims of subterfuge was just silly. the ""American soil"" argument in regards to the monument is shaky in more ways than one. ...consider US Monument at Little Big Horn. i have seen monuments to US troops in Okinawa (where we still have active military bases by the way).

2994737,4,B000X0GNYE,I have submitted another review.  This event needs to be in all U.S. history books.  My next trip to Alaska I would like to visit a battle site..  A regret I have is my favorite uncle was in Alaska during WWII and never talked about the event.,1356998400,,243,4.127659574468085
2994738,5,B000X0GNYE,"Red White Black & Blue is an inspiring documentary about the Battle of Attu in the Aleutian Campaign of World War II in Alaska. The story telling is vigorous and insightful. It is imaginative and affective and provides a fresh treatment to an experience and episode that called for being told by both the warriors who fought it and those who have walked the hallowed ground and felt the spirits from those bygone days. Clearly, it is an outstanding work - it is fully complimentary with all that was written in both the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Attu and through the decades since. Interestingly, the use of digital editing brings the battlefield itself back to life with extraordinary impact - resulting with a very different feel and look that has been seen in a wide range of other history programs. - Prof Michael Haller",1339977600,4,835,4.726027397260274
2994739,3,B000X0GNYE,"First, be prepared for a documentary with a hidden meaning to it...Also be prepared and know that this documentary has very little combat footage and even less information about the Aleutian battles...This is mostly about the veterans recent visit there with footage mostly of the landscape

Too often do the Aleutian's get passed over by the masses, too few americans know that U.S soil was occupied by a foreign power...Even though the Aleutian occupation by japan was not an immediate threat when invaded because it was really used as a smoke screen for japanese ships invading midway and at the time posed no strategic value it was nonetheless american soil and our people died there...This was a symbolic victory for the Japanese and also a slap in the face for the united states which since has seemed to wanna bury the aleutians with other forgotten history but you cannot because those troops died to take back what was ours...

In this documentary you will see some very emotional veterans describing what it was like on the aleutian's, explaining the harsh conditions they fought in and why it was so important and should never be forgotten...These troops for the first and only time in american history had to fight to retake american soil from a foreign army, I have so much respect for these men because you could say that out of all the battles in WW2 the aleutians became symbolically to us the most important because it was american soil..Many will say that it was hell, that the terrain was worthless, that the conditions were so bad weather wise one would say "" Why the hell are we going there""... It's America, thats why!

The thing that bothered me the most were also the monuments erected by the japanese supposedly for the memory of all troops that died there but as you see the emotion in these mens faces when they see this monument they call it what it is.. A disgrace to americans, that the U.S would allow the Japanese to errect a monument on American soil for the memory of any Jap that died there is a slap in the face to all the U.S veterans that fought there..You also see the impact this has on them when they say they will lobby to have this monument removed.. The research I've dug up was that the motive behind it was the Japs that committed suicide on the island and to commemorate their own dead...This monument would not stand anywhere else in the country especially pearl so why, and please do not tell me it is because it is so remote that nobody goes there but it is also insulting to some inuit who find it inappropriate

Overall I found this documentary very enlightening, there is not much footage from WW2 on here mostly just two men remembering the past but it serves it's purpose very well in enlightening some people whom didn't even know what the aleutians were or that they were invaded resulting in a lot of american soldiers lives to take back what was ours... The Japanese were the most ruthless people in the world during the war, the atrocities committed by them were never equaled by anyone else...The treatment of people by the Japanese were horrifying even to the Nazis, more than once did germany even advise Japan to treat people more humanely, worrying that what they did to any non Japanese would result in grave international consequences..

Finally, I find this film enjoyable but there was just something in the background that I didn't understand, there is almost no footage of the combat here which makes me research the real meaning of this film... I have many documentaries on this subject but this is the first with such a lack of historical footage,  yes you hear the men describing what happened but without the footage that should accompany much of this there is just passing footage of the alaskan landscape..I was thinking this was just about those men going back there for the first time since the war but through research I found out that one of the purposes of this film was TO REMOVE the japanese memorial there which many deem inappropriate...

This is the meaning to the film so if you would like to see a more accurate depiction of this part of the war I recommend checking out the title (The Bloody Aleutians) which will give you a more in depth explanation on this with many many more original pics and footage...I gave this a four because of the emotion and feeling of the men who are showed in it but as a documentary piece on the Aleutians during WW2 it falls very short...Much of what happened in the Aleutians cannot be found here so if you are looking for more of a historic view on it you should pick up something with a lil more information

As it stands, this cannot be considered a history on the battles in the Aleutians,  there is too little information",1328313600,3,4749,4.6040189125295505
2994740,5,B000X0GNYE,"This movie paints a horrific tale of war. I always considered myself a World War 2 history fan, and I was embarrassed to learn that there was a fight on American soil that I had never even heard of. And what's more, is that the fighting was unbelievably fierce. One of the veterans describes Attu as ten times worse than Okinawa. I'd like to point out that he's allowed to say that since he fought in both places.
The documentary does a good job of not being overly obnoxious about the information it displays, and presenting everything in a structured, well written manner. I definitely suggest this for war history fans.",1313971200,3,622,4.612612612612613

He never spoke about it, so like most Americans, I was clueless about what went on.
The video was really interesting, but could have been a lot better with some tighter editing.
They took 86 minutes to give about 45 min. worth of info.
It would have been lots better if they interviewed several more people, not just two former soldiers.

Overall I found this documentary very enlightening, there is not much footage from WW2 on here mostly just two men remembering the past but it serves it's purpose very well in enlightening some people whom didn't even know what the aleutians were or that they were invaded resulting in a lot of american soldiers lives to take back what was ours... The Japanese were the most ruthless people in the world during the war, the atrocities committed by them were never equaled by anyone else...The treatment of people by the Japanese were horrifying even to the Nazis, more than once did germany even advise Japan to treat people more humanely, worrying that what they did to any non Japanese would result in grave international consequences..

Finally, I find this film enjoyable but there was just something in the background that I didn't understand, there is almost no footage of the combat here which makes me research the real meaning of this film... I have many documentaries on this subject but this is the first with such a lack of historical footage,  yes you hear the men describing what happened but without the footage that should accompany much of this there is just passing footage of the alaskan landscape..I was thinking this was just about those men going back there for the first time since the war but through research I found out that one of the purposes of this film was TO REMOVE the japanese memorial there which many deem inappropriate...

This is the meaning to the film so if you would like to see a more accurate depiction of this part of the war I recommend checking out the title (The Bloody Aleutians) which will give you a more in depth explanation on this with many many more original pics and footage...I gave this a four because of the emotion and feeling of the men who are showed in it but as a documentary piece on the Aleutians during WW2 it falls very short...Much of what happened in the Aleutians cannot be found here so if you are looking for more of a historic view on it you should pick up something with a lil more information

As it stands, this cannot be considered a history on the battles in the Aleutians,  there is too little information",1328313600,3,4749,4.6040189125295505
3229237,5,B000X0GNYE,"This movie paints a horrific tale of war. I always considered myself a World War 2 history fan, and I was embarrassed to learn that there was a fight on American soil that I had never even heard of. And what's more, is that the fighting was unbelievably fierce. One of the veterans describes Attu as ten times worse than Okinawa. I'd like to point out that he's allowed to say that since he fought in both places.
The documentary does a good job of not being overly obnoxious about the information it displays, and presenting everything in a structured, well written manner. I definitely suggest this for war history fans.",1313971200,3,622,4.612612612612613

3229240,4,B000X0GNYE,"I was really looking forward to this video, since my dad fought in the Battle of Attu.
He never spoke about it, so like most Americans, I was clueless about what went on.
The video was really interesting, but could have been a lot better with some tighter editing.
They took 86 minutes to give about 45 min. worth of info.
It would have been lots better if they interviewed several more people, not just two former soldiers.
Nonetheless, there aren't many videos about Attu, so I would recommend it.",1218153600,3,499,4.555555555555555

One thing that perplexed me the most was when one of the veterans attested that the Battle of Attu was ""10x worse than Okinawa"". I would highly recommend at least renting it. Well worth the 3$.",1435017600,,289,4.918367346938775

The footage of the Battle for Attu, a little known, knock-down, drag out World War II battle, really put me in the boots of the soldiers on the ground during the three-week siege of Japanese occupied American soil. The story is told through the tale of two soldiers who return to the remote Alaskan Island for the first time.",1416528000,,360,4.73015873015873

8226386,5,B000X0GNYE,This is a wonderful documentary by two 80+ year old veterans of the Battle of Attu and they bring to life the suffering and horrific conditions these soldiers were place in during the 19 day battle.  This is also a wonderful primer for anyone interested in the Forgotten War in Alaska against the Japanese.  The Battle of Attu was the only battle fought in North America in artic conditions during WWII.  The two veterans went on to fight in many additional Pacific Campaigns until the end of the war but they describe this early battle as the worse experience of the war for both of them.  The Battle of Attu ended with one of the largest Japanese Banzai charges during the war which cut through the American front lines and almost succeeded in reaching the beaches where the supply depots were located. These two amazing vets share the experience of facing this attack.  Throughout the video you also experience the harsh conditions on the island as the US Coast Guard vehicles transporting them to the various battle sites become stuck in the mud and soft tundra.  Overall an amazing insight into a battle few people have ever heard of as described by two men who were there.,1388188800,2,1178,4.666666666666667

MY FATHER WENT THROUGH ALL THE BATTLES OF THE 7TH DIVISION (ATTU TO OKINAWA) AND NEVER MENTIONED THEM TO HIS FAMILY WHILE HE WAS ALIVE.  HE WAS A FRONT LINE OFFICER AND IS MENTIONED IN SEVERAL HISTORY BOOKS AS HIS COMPANY LED THE CHARGE TO TAKE HILL 95 ON OKINAWA, CONSIDERED TO BE THE LAST 'BATTLE OF W W 2'.",1384905600,,657,4.620689655172414
