8494257,5,B00670YYLI,"This is the kind of drama that made me addicted to Korean Dramas because it is a lovely story enacted by some of the finest actors who have continued to give us great performances in many productions over the years.  In addition, the beautiful messages about love of family, dedication, and responsibility are worth hearing again and again.  It's a ""feel-good"" movie for the whole family to watch.",1416441600,,397,4.823529411764706
