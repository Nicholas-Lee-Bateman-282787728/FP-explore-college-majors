8047462,5,B0007GP7ZA,DVD came just as described and in good condition.  This video covers many topics and is great for my high school science classroom but is now somewhat hard to find for purchase.  I was glad to get a hold of it.,1356566400,,210,4.097560975609756
8047463,3,B0007GP7ZA,"This is an older series. If you are a little science minded/interested then i do recommend this. It covers the roll that individuals played in the discoveries that contribute to our lives today.

The quality of the images is quite poor.  I gather originally recorded on tape.

I think it is good value and I gained some new insites from it.",1190160000,,340,4.540983606557377
