8181558,5,B000031EGH,"I don't have a cast list with me, but it wouldn't probably wouldn't help anyone but a real opera specialist. The orchestra is quite young and well conducted and the sound is excellent. Each of the singers is really careful and the quality of the singing is superb. The only exception to this is Lescaut who is a little wobbly for my taste. The staging is peculiar, setting the yard of the inn as a small time carnival in Act 1. But, I must say that this works very well and makes sense of some lines that were not clear to me from other versions. There is clutter later in the act but it does not detract from the effect. The chorus is most impressive and the parade of prostitutes in Act III is excellently done. The lead, Manon, acts reasonably well and seems to fit the four phases of Manon's character. Her singing is truly magnificent. DeGrieux is played by a short singer who is not preposessing and is not a very good actor. He always seems to be orientating himself to get the maximum support from the stage and hall which detracts from the visual but produces a clear, accurate and powerful sound. Indeed, he sometimes overbalances Manon.",998870400,,1147,4.466666666666667
