Courtney Vance was excellant as the government elimenator,Regina King is always a favorite of mine. All in all i think what really sold me was the musicical sound track. it was off the chain. NOW IF AMAZON WILL JUST HELP ME LOCATE IT SO I CAN BUY IT!",1076976000,,463,4.333333333333333
8319759,3,6305841233,"A movie for an evening at home -- not a great movie, but paced and plotted so that the tape will probably play to the end, with noone being bored -- a predictable end, but one would not expect heavy drama or deep tragedy from this comedy/action/romance film.  The cast is talented and do well with their roles; Courtney Vance emits his usual likeable screen personnae and is as convincing when wielding a gun as he is when kissing his girl, well played by Regina King and the chemistry between Vance and King is believable. Jason Alexander and Regina King perform a cute dance scene. The confession in the church is one instance when the humor has an original note.  You may not hold your breath at the suspense ending but will probably keep your eyes on the screen.  All in all, a good one for a dinner and a movie evening.",990403200,2,824,4.407894736842105
