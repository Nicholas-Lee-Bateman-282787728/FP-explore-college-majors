8462940,5,B0059GVB3A,"Had wanted to watch Trail of the Hawk because it was the directorial debute of Edward Dymtryk who went on to direct a bevy of  fine films and blockbusters most notably Back To Bataan (1945), The Caine Mutiny (1954), The Young Lions (1958), Walk On The Wild Side (1952) and The Carpetbaggers (1964).  The movie didn't disappoint me; it had excellent continuity and plausibility, which were missing in many of the old western movies.  My family and I enjoyed it.",1436659200,,460,4.725
