1331728,5,B00003N3BZ,"I have been fly fishing for decades, starting in the northeast and since then having fished all over.  I have seen almost all the fly fishing DVDs and videos produced and this show is, without a doubt, about the best.  It is just what its title says -- about strategies and how to fish different kinds of water, no matter if that water is located in New England, the west, the south or Alaska.  The DVD covers rivers (both large and not-so-large), little streams, lakes, bends in rivers, undercut banks . . . you name it.

The viewer learns how to position himself for casting and then why and how to cast the correct fly, be it nymphs, dries, hoppers, streamers -- everything is covered.  And the results are beautiful - a variety of beautiful trout are caught and released.  We do relate to (and laugh) when we see what happens in one location - where a stream joins a river - with a whitefish and squawfish hooked on nymphs and brought in.

This is not a casting video - as the title says, it's about strategies.  And what a joy to see the late author and respected teacher Gary LaFontaine in such fine form.  He was such an expert, such a wealth of knowledge and such a nice man.  And here he is, not only passing along wonderful knowledge, but also being so friendly and fun-to-be-with.  He and Dick Sharon are perfect because they not only educate and instruct the viewer but also entertain, and have a good time doing it.  They are a terrific duo.

I can understand why the overwhelming majority of customer reviews for this show (including some from professional guides) are so highly complimentary.  This is a DVD that I watch over and over again, sometimes for knowledge and tips, sometimes purely for the entertainment value of being out on the water in my heart and mind when I can't be there in person.",1138406400,,1815,4.477203647416413

1331730,5,B00003N3BZ,"I am a rookie in trout fishing, and I got several decent size brown and cutthroat trouts in yellowstone. I think the most of my fishing knowledge were from this DVD. I love it and really appreciate this DVD. Also, the authors provide a very usful suggestion in the fishing strategy. Got it and you will enjoy this DVD.",1124582400,,318,4.406779661016949
1331731,5,B00003N3BZ,"As I am new to fly fishing, this DVD was recommended to me by a good friend.  I am impressed with the clear explanations of the kinds of choices a fly fisher can have  in a particular location.  I couldn't wait to get out on the water to try what I'd  learned, and just this past week, I was able to.  Using what I learned from the ""SFFStrategies"" DVD, I amazed myself (as well as my much more experienced friends who were fishing with me) with how well I did and how much knowledge I had picked up.  I now realize that the observations and analyzation Gary talks about are really valuable, and I also better appreciate the entertaining humor these guys show.",1115856000,,659,4.317073170731708
1331732,5,B00003N3BZ,"As a guide on the Madison River out of Ennis, MT. for the last 10 years I thought this program did an excellent job of teaching those fishing strategies in a live class room.  I have spent many days guiding on the Beaverhead river over the years and in my mind it can be one of the most difficult rivers to guide on. Watching this program has actually helped me do a better job in helping my clients be more successful fishing this river.  I find it helpful to watch as many  programs as possible about fly fishing because I am always looking for tips to give me an edge on the water with my clients.  This program did that as well as being easy to watch. It was interesting, it was done well and it covered many different fishing situations that most anglers find themselves in on a regular basis. I also really enjoyed the way Dick Sharon and Gary Lafontaine interacted, it looked and sounded like they were having lots of fun.  I give it a 2 thumbs up.",1113004800,,955,4.254143646408839
1331733,5,B00003N3BZ,"I was looking for a good Instructional DVD that could demonstrate fishing tips that I could really use.  I checked out the Editorial Reviews under Successful Fly Fishing Strategies and was impressed with the fact that so many experts say that this show is the best. The experts quoted are people most of us have either seen or read, doing their own shows and writing articles and books.  So I bought the DVD.  It is really good.  After viewing it a few times I realized that this show talks about what we all think while fishing.....""Is this the best technique......the most effective approach?""  Well, Gary and Dick help you really under- stand how to evaluate all the situations and, best of all, do so with fun and understandable explanations.  So I say, listen to what these professionals have to teach.  This is not one  of those dry ""talk-talk-talk"" shows, but an enjoyable presentation of techniques, all done with humor and actual on-site examples.  They actually show you how. I think it's a great example of what entertaining instruction should be, for a sport we love so much, the great sport of Fly Fishing.

1331734,5,B00003N3BZ,"The fishing situations depicted in this DVD are classic, with Gary and Dick explaining the choices a fly fisher has in how best to fish them.  We learn which choices are good and which are bad and, most importantly, why.  This is what makes the show so valuable.  The fun they have together, the knowledge they present and the entertainment they provide are truly special.  A great show.",1103155200,,387,4.647058823529412
1331735,5,B00003N3BZ,"What a pleasant surprise this DVD is! It is unheard of for fishing videos to have great photography, good writing and good humor. This is a far cry from the single camera, poorly edited efforts which escape on to the market. This very entertaining work also provides real answers if you are new to the sport or an old hand. The chance to see the late Gary Lafontaine work a dry fly is worth the price of admission. The section on Small Streams is especially good. Wonder of wonders - you get to see fish taking the fly! I also like that the director remains true to his subject ""Strategies"" and does not stray into flytying, casting or hero shots. If you're like me, you will keep this DVD on the very top of the pile for repeat viewing.",1103068800,,737,4.309352517985611
1331736,2,B00003N3BZ,"pleasant, but not a homerun...felt a bit stiff.
i applaud the effort. and, if you are in the intermediate level
and need a psychological reason to make you moves, i think this will be better than if you are a longterm fly fisher(person).",1102204800,,237,4.534883720930233
1331737,2,B00003N3BZ,"Good stuff, but didn't feel that new.

Tobe honest, it was not on the entertainment level of the film

i was given for my birthday from HowardFilms.com (""Rising Tide""):

that film was a rush -  of information, culture, story and pro cinema....

strategies was nice, but this thing rocked. not like anything you've seen. believe me.

i like ""strategies"" as a concept, but i think i felt it was not pushing the envelope that much. and it is about time someone did.",1102204800,,462,4.573170731707317
1331738,5,B00003N3BZ,"While books, tapes and seminars can all be helpful, inarguably the best way to learn the real nitty-gritty of fly fishing is by tramping afield with a savvy, squint-eyed veteran. Successful Fly Fishing Strategies, with Gary LaFontaine and Dick Sharon, comes as close to taking you along for an angling session on a Montana trout stream as you'll ever likely experience without getting your boots muddy.
The graceful style in which this video has been conceived and produced makes you feel as if you're there, right there peering over the shoulders of LaFontaine and Sharon--two guys whose casual, unaffected manner, not to mention non-stop jive,jibes and jest, makes them the kind of river-rats you definitely want to hang-out with. But make no mistake, though humorous and unpretentious, LaFontaine and Sharon expertly slice and dice every stretch of water they encounter and the insights they impart along the way are dead on. The methods and tactics entertainingly rendered in this video will translate straight from the lumbar cushion on your Barcalounger to a boulder studded riffle on the Big Hole.",1052524800,,1104,5.173184357541899
1331739,5,B00003N3BZ,"I'm not a fan of most ""how to"" fishing videos. They can be very boring, and trying to watch one which was filmed with a single video camera borrowed from Uncle Joe makes it worse.
I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. The ""star,"" the late Gary LaFontaine, has the ability to communicate vital info without sounding dull. Sidekicks Dick Sharon and Gary's dog keep it interesting, with plenty of humor.
Several years ago I had the opportunity to see Jeff Pill, the producer of this DVD, do a presentation to our fly fishing club of exactly what goes into making a high quality fishing video. It was eye opening. I guess Pill used to be a TV sports producer. Basically, whatever technical equipment and expertise is required to make a quality TV show or documentary is also required to make a good fishing video, beyond the fishing expert and information. It is an expensive proposition.
The production values of this DVD are excellent, certainly a quantum step beyond any other fishing videos. There were obviously multiple cameras used, with professional editing and effects, plus music which melds perfectly with the presentation. Until you are stuck watching a cheapo fishing video you don't know how important production quality is.
DVD is the ideal media for an instructional video like this. The ability to quickly go to exactly the chapter you want to review is great, without having to wear out your thumb on the VCR's fast forward button.
This DVD was exceptional, and I would highly recommend it to all other fly fishermen. To avoid further disappointment, however, I'll continue to skip other fishing videos.",1044144000,,1619,4.890909090909091
1331740,5,B00003N3BZ,Now the best  course on Fly Fishing for both beginners and seasoned flyfishers is available on DVD. I have learned more about Fly Fishing from watching Dick and Gary than from any other source and you will too. This new DVD version makes it easy to review a favorite section or learn a new technique for your fishing trip. If you can't go fishing with your personal guide try this. Perhaps you could say a picture is worth a thousand fish.,1042761600,,439,4.419753086419753
1331741,5,B00003N3BZ,"The first few years of a fly fishers world are concerned with learning about tackle, learning to tye knots, picking the right fly, , learning to cast. Most of this stuff can be learned at home, from friends, from books or from videos. But then comes the fishing. After learning all the other stuff a beginner can still be lost on the stream without actually knowing how to fish.
Thats what this video is all about. The actual fishing. Dick and Gary take the viewer to a spot and discuss where they would fish this spot from and why. The video does contail a lot of good natured jocking around. This video is as close to a day on the river with a guide as you can get. A real joy to watch!",1041552000,,688,4.180451127819549
1331742,5,B00003N3BZ,"Being a fan of movies as well as fly fishing, I have to say that I think the ""Successful Fly Fishing Strategies"" videos are excellent. They look terrific and are packed with lots of information that will come in very useful the next time I'm on the water. A technique of drawing lines and arrows on top of some of the scenes really helped me understand where fish are located and how I should position myself to fish to them. I really enjoyed the variety of fishing locations. I bought these videos, but now see that they are on one DVD and plan to give the DVD to a couple friends as holiday gifts.",1039996800,,599,4.2631578947368425
1331743,5,B00003N3BZ,"Having gotten into fly fishing in the last few years, I was looking for videos that would be helpful, instructive and NOT boring.  I saw these shows on Amazon.com and first looked at the Editorial Reviews.  Many of the most respected people in fly fishing are really complimentary about them.  I also looked at all the customer reviews and I saw that the vast majority are definitely positive.  So I bought them, and all I can say is, they are terrific.  You can watch them for pure entertainment value, or fill a notebook with great tactics, strategies, tips and advice  all, I believe, applicable no matter where I fish.  I like the way so much information is conveyed while, at the same time, these guys are having such a good time.  What a pleasure to see Gary LaFontaine actually doing what he writes about.  These shows bring his books to life.",1039564800,,850,4.576158940397351
1331744,5,B00003N3BZ,"I've watched them all, and most fly fishing videos show the same things. Not these two. You feel you're actually walking the waters with two of the best guides in the business. I learn something new every time I watch them.",994809600,,223,4.463414634146342
1331745,5,B00003N3BZ,"I have been viewing and using these tapes now for about 5 years, and every time I put a tape in the VCR I know that when I push play I will learn something I didn't catch the time before.  The tapes are like an ""old friend"" that has something new to share with me each time I see him.  Dick and Gary are the definition of on stream fun while at the same time, true professors in the skills of disecting a piece of water and sharing successful techniques to pursue the one thing we all have in common...the love of catching trout.  Push play, sit back and learn.",986688000,,561,4.081818181818182
1331746,1,B00003N3BZ,"LaFontaine is well known for his texts but this video set is extremely disappointing.
In each example situation, fundamentals of presentation (ie casting and rationale for presentation) are so idiosyncratic that I doubt they have any utility for the novice or experienced fly fisher.
The comic relief in this video is barely tolerable.  Save your $.",983404800,,349,5.232142857142857
1331747,5,B00003N3BZ,"If you have ever wondered how that guy at the bend in the river is hooking and landing all those trout while you are not, this is the tape for you. Dick Sharon  and Gary LaFontaine explain the how and why of fly fishing in  an entertaining and concise manner. This is more than just watching two  guys haul big fish from beautiful rivers. This is a rare opportunity to get  inside the heads of two accomplished fishermen.  Whether you are an expert  or a beginner, take the time to learn a few secrets from two people who  obviously enjoy fishing and know what they are talking about.",961372800,,584,4.351851851851852
1331754,4,B00003N3BZ,"These informative videos will prove to be valuable resourses for anyone hoping to learn the basics (and beyond) of flyfishing.  They are quite complete.  Lafontaine and Sharon cover such techniques as deep and shallow  water nymphing, dry and wet fly fishing in a variety of water types, and  even lake fishing.  Even more impressive is the fact that they emphasized  (not just glossed over) the importance of reading the water and  anticipating the location and behavior of trout *before* trying to randomly  catch them.
Excellent camera work.",956707200,,544,5.172413793103448

1331756,5,B00003N3BZ,"These are the best fly fishing videos I have seen.  I love it when you see a fish take the fly and most videos and TV shows don't show takes.  These do.  I have read books by LaFontaine, but didn't know he could be so quick  and so funny on camera.  I'm fairly experienced at the sport, but I really  learned a lot about things I have never analyzed properly.  The videos made  me feel that I could become really good at this.",951091200,,426,4.048192771084337
1331757,5,B00003N3BZ,"My boyfriend and I are just starting to fly fish. I was concerned about what the best way to learn is, the best way to use our time and money to learn(besides hiring a guide and spending a day on the water). After I saw  these two videos advertised, I decided to buy them and have them be one of  my contributions to our equipping ourselves. They are really fun, and when  we want to be serious and learn, we can almost fill up a tablet taking  notes to study later. But what's nice is that if I just want to sit down  and "" get out on the water"" and see how enjoyable the sport is, I  can watch them and I don't feel like I'm working or being lectured. We have  both watched them a number of times, and each time, we gain something new.",950832000,,737,3.9727891156462585
1331758,5,B00003N3BZ,These are the two best flyfishing videos I have seen. Not only are they very educational but they also make you laugh.

They are very informative and interesting to watch (other flyfishing instructional videos are so boring) They are fun to watch even a second and third time.

However, I agree with some of the previous reviews that it just seemed to lack some in depth analysis and discussion of casting, equipment setup, etc. I wish I would have saved the money and put it towards a professional guide trip or casting lessons.

I'm going to re-watch it mid-season to see if I can pick anything up that I didn't the first round, but again, a guide and internet research is probably better money spent.",1429747200,,534,4.448979591836735

It doesn't try to fill your head with the Latin names of various ""bugs"", but instead gives you excellent information on reading the stream, and the best locations to fish different types of water. And all in a very laid-back, relaxed style! So enjoyable, I have watched it several times.

7919071,4,B00003N3BZ,"One of the best ""how to"" fishing videos I've ever seen.

With that said, they spend time on blue ribbon locations that for the most part are devoid of other anglers. Almost anyone will catch fish at those locations and not alot of, ""we wanted to dry fly fish at location X but there were already others fishing the spot so we switched to location Y and decided to nymph after nothing rose to drys because we caught these nymphs with a seine,"" which is more realistic of the challenges that the average person faces when fly-fishing.

reviews and the customer reviews, I assumed it was

good, but I didn't realize how good.  I, along with

others in fly fishing, revere the name Gary LaFontaine

for his research, knowledge and friendly personality,

so wanted to see him in action.  I also had read that

he considered this the best production he had ever

been involved in.

During my first viewing, I realized that not only was

the DVD filled with valuable information, but that it

was also professionally produced and just plain fun to

watch.  You can't beat that combination.  And seeing

Gary in his prime is just great; what a shame when he

succumbed to ALS a few years ago.  But what a delight

to see him interacting with Dick Sharon and the

""third"" member of the team, Chester (Gary's dog).  I
