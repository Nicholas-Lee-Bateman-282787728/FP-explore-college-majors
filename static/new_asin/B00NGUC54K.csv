8678088,3,B00NGUC54K,"It really should be a two star because the ending was terrible because I never got the answer I was waiting for even though I sat watching the entire movie, but the rest of the movie deserves a three star.  The story is decent, but I hate the ending.  Oh, did I say that already?  Anyway, the movie is about the characters in a book. The Reader, which is what La Lectora means from Spanish, reads this book and you learn what has happened in the past few days prior to the reader reading the book.  A gang, the police and the army are looking for a briefcase that was stolen from the gang leader's sons while in a taxi with a taxi driver and a female dancer who works for the gang's club.  Anyway, the taxi driver and the dancer ends up getting the case by mistake.  Not knowing what is in this briefcase, it seems to be super important or valuable to almost everyone.  The taxi driver sees it as an opportunity to strike it rich.  The female dancer sees it as trouble and wants nothing to do with it.  The gang wants it back.  The army just wants it.  The police wants it because it was believed to be the cause of a murder that took place.  The questions are where is this briefcase, what happens to the people involved with this briefcase, what is in this briefcase?  Well, watch the movie to find out and you will like the movie until you reach the very end.",1446940800,,1362,4.1923076923076925
