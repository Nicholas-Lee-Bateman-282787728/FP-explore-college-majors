8437841,2,B003ZK9BSY,"After the huge success of the indie prison movie ""Penitentiary,"" it seems director Jamaa Fanaka got a bit lazy. Lacking the heart and soul, as well as the intelligent, realistic drama and smart comic moments, this sequel is surprisingly silly, stupid, low-brow entertainment.  Very disappointing for anyone who loves and respects the original movie, as I do.",1529280000,,358,5.280701754385965
8437842,5,B003ZK9BSY,"Again, the interviews are pretentious, self important and a bit too much bragging... but this movie is a riot!!!  Be proud of what you created, no need to try and push it as something it's not.  This is not pushing the creative boundaries of film, but it IS a great exploitation title!!!",1520380800,,287,4.5
