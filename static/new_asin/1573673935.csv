7798550,2,1573673935,"The DVD was supposed to have 7 card designs and practice images included on the ""Pattern CD"", that could be printed out to practice along with the instructor while she demonstrated the techniques. However, the designs on the Pattern CD had large copyright watermarks on the images. As a result I was unable to print the images to use for practice coloring for the class since it would be irritating to spend time coloring over the top of a copyright watermark. I assumed that by purchasing the  Create with Copics; Beginners Guide DVD that included 7 card designs and practice images I would receive the images without watermarks. I was disappointed so I looked on Annies crafts website and another person wrote a review complaining about this same thing, and customer service responded saying they had fixed the problem. It didn't work for me though when I opened the Pattern CD. ??? I did purchase another DVD from the same instructor to color people and it did include the practice images to print out ""without watermarks"".",1435017600,,1026,4.829545454545454
