8359013,2,B002A6C3T8,"the premise was promising - a young japanese wife - living a lonely mundane existence while her husband works overseas - and feeling unloved cuz when he calls  - he only asks if she's been feeding his pet turtle - then she find the little postage stamp sized ad inviting her to become a spy

she joins without asking which country is paying - and she's instructed to remain inconspicuous - so she continues her mundane existence - but now with a sense of purpose - and a pile of money in her refrigerator

sadly - the writing failed to find the story elements to bring this to life - there's a poop joke in the middle of the film which seems to illustrate how desperate the writers were for substance

i don't think this is an issue of humor not working across cultures - the film wasn't well received in Japan either

Ueno Juri is fine as the young wife - the other actors manage to not over mug while mugging - the visuals are nice if a little heavy handed with the green-red-yellow palatte

i can only recommend this if you want to see all Ueno Juri films - oh - Y Aoi has a supporting role",1315785600,,1093,4.205741626794258
