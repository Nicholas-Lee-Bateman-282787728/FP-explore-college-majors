LINK is really a cult classic.",995155200,20,384,3.9358974358974357
574448,5,6303149170,"I once read an editorial review which said that LINK is not horrifying , not suspensful or even entertaining. Well , I think that this so-called critic should better write cook books. Or, instead of saying bad things  about someone else's Film , why doesn't he write his own to show us what HE  can do ? Yes , LINK is suspensful , it is an original horror Film (and not  a bloody slasher movie), with a nice cast (Terence Stamp as the eccentric  teacher , and Elizabeth Shue as his student) ,and
Jerry Goldsmith did one  of his best soundtrack for this Film. LINK was awarded at the ""Film  Fantastique Festival"" in France , and it is a GREAT film , no matter  what some may say.",964396800,,678,4.25

574596,4,6303149170,"Not widely known, this nifty 1986 British horror film stars a young Elisabeth Shue (was this her first film?) and mature Terence Stamp.  ""Link"" is brilliant orangutan who attacks his masters when they try to put him down.  Although the title creature is clearly an orangutan, he is referred to as a chimp.  It looks like his naturally reddish fur has been dyed dark brown or black.

The one scene I recall most vividly is when Shue's character is undressed and about to take a bath, Link opens the bathroom door, enters, and looks at her naked body longingly as she freezes, about to step into the tub.

Shot on location in Scotland, the emotive score is by Jerry Goldsmith.  The taught direction is by the late Richard Franklin.",1319328000,,729,4.612403100775194

574598,5,6303149170,"LINK---is totally awsome. In some segments you will laugh or even be frightened to death. He is one mean monkey!!
If you love science or even horror you would love this film. You will think twice raising a monkey to be a servant to you!!  Just to remember to forgive and love one another.",1268784000,,288,4.333333333333333
574599,4,6303149170,"""There's just a few rules that you have to remember: 1. You're the dominant species. You must never, ever treat them as equals. 2. Don't ever let anything escalate. Always forgive them, whatever they do. 3. Don't get involved in their squabbles. They sort them out. And 4. Erm, some turds in the hall. Can you clear them up?""

Whenever anyone comes up with that kind of list in a movie you can start ticking off the order in which they'll be forgotten and place your bets on who dies first, and Richard Franklin's Link is no exception to the rule. It's not a particularly ambitious film - it can pretty much be summed as a girl stalked in a remote country house by an unbalanced killer, with the spin being that this time the killer is an ape - but it's a pleasingly well-crafted and executed one. Unusually for director Richard Franklin the influence here seems to be less Hitchcock than Argento, with plenty of bravura camerawork - complicated tracking shots, long lenses, multiple speeds and step-printed scenes that are far more effective than they have any right to be. Naturally the apes outshine the humans (Elisabeth Shue and a fairly brief but entertaining turn from Terence Stamp), with Locke the Orangutan giving a surprisingly layered turn as Link himself, the unstable former circus hack and ""Master of Fire.""

Barely remembered today, it's one of those films that just got lost in the cracks: a key and very expensive part of Verity Lambert's catastrophic production slate (The Holcroft Covenant, Wild Geese II, Morons From Outer Space, Bloodbath at the House of Death, Slayground etc) that led to EMI films being sold lock, stock and barrel to Cannon, who promptly dumped it with a token release. The film rarely even turns up on TV these days. But any ape movie with a heroine called Jane (after Jane Goodall, not Tarzan's mate) that uses both The Kinks I'm An Apeman and Marlene Dietrich's entrance in a gorilla suit from Blonde Venus as well as offering an infectiously demented Jerry Goldsmith Baroque`n'Roll score mixing synths, symphony orchestra, calliope and a 7/8 drumbeat definitely deserves a second look.

Not much in the way ofextras - trailer, TV spot and notes are your lot - but a decent widescreen transfer.",1203206400,,2239,4.795336787564767
574600,5,6303149170,"Jane (the ultra-loverly Elisabeth Shue) gets a job as an assistant to Dr. Phillips (Terrence ""Zod"" Stamp), and moves into his remote castle in order to help him w/ his ape experiments. Jane is amazed by Phillips' two chimps, Imp and Voodoo, but is especially taken w/ his orangutan butler, Link. Everything is great until Dr. Phillips goes missing, leaving Jane at the mercy of an increasingly menacing Link! Of course, a visitor stops by only to be dealt with rather savagely, and Jane's boyfriend arrives w/ two chums, unaware of the injuries and sudden deaths awaiting them! Ms. Shue's character is quite charming and even manages to be firm w/ Link when necessary. Mr. Stamp is also good, though his part is more of an extended cameo. LINK is a superior ""animals gone bananas"" horror/thriller. Some of the looks from that orangutan were actually pretty creepy!...",1186185600,,867,4.904761904761905

574602,4,6303149170,"Everyone's got goals in life, things they hope to achieve at some point or another, and one of mine was to someday have my very own monkey butler...alas, after watching the film Link (1986) I'm having second thoughts as I've learned you can take a hulking orangutan out of the jungle, dress him up in butler gear and teach him to serve, but at some point he'll probably go a bit nutty on you and rip your arm out of the socket just for kicks...directed by Richard Franklin (Roadgames, Psycho II, Cloak & Dagger), the film stars Elisabeth Shue (The Karate Kid, Leaving Las Vegas, Hollow Man) and Terence `General Zod' Stamp (Superman II, Alien Nation, The Limey).  Also appearing is Steven Pinner, Richard Garnett (Doomsday Gun), and David O'Hara (Hotel Rwanda).

Shue plays Jane Chase, and American college student in England who lands a housekeeping/assistant gig with an eccentric professor named Dr. Steven Phillip (Stamp) in his isolated, coastal country estate, the majority of the residents being primates (seems the professor's experiments involve trying to find the common ground between human and primate intelligence or some such thing).  As Jane arrives at Doctor Phillip's home, she meets the three beasts, the first being an orangutan butler named Link (whose actually dressed as a butler and likes to smoke cigars...a habit he picked up in the circus), a young chimpanzee named Imp, and an older female chimpanzee named Voodoo.  Not long after Jane settles in the apes stage a sort of revolt (Link learns of his impending `early' retirement), the Professor goes missing, and Jane soon finds herself prisoner within the house, which is fortified with bars on the windows, cut off from the outside world as someone (or something) has trashed the phone line.  Not only that but it seems Link has taken a real shine to Jane, illustrated earlier by his penchant for ogling her as she strips to take a bath (which also provides us with a brief side shot of a nekkid Shue), even to the point of being jealous of Jane's playful relationship with Imp, the small chimpanzee.  David (Pinner), Jane's boyfriend, worried for Jane's welfare, makes the scene with a couple of friends, providing some fodder for Link, as his mischievous ways turn deadly.  Eventually Jane discovers what happened to Dr. Phillip, along with discovering Link is a heck of a lot smarter than she gave him credit for eventually having to pit her wits against the orangutan's for survival.

Overall I liked this film, but then again I'm somewhat biased towards anything with monkeys in it, the exception being that awful Tony Danza/Danny DeVito film Going Ape! (1981)...the human characters in this film don't really amount to much as Terrance Stamp is barely there (talk about weak characters...his role is solely to provide the setup for Jane and the apes before he exits, stage left), and Ms. Shue is stuck with a somewhat annoying character redeemed mainly by the fact she's incredibly easy on the eyes (and then some).  When I say annoying I refer specifically to her judgmental tendencies in terms of her employer and his relationships with his ape subjects.  Her character sought out the professor and wormed her way into a position supposedly due to an admiration and respect she had for the man and his work, but once in place she begins expressing issues she has with how he operates and the way he treats his subjects (his character never physically abused the animals onscreen, but he was strict with the creatures, as it's important to show dominance, apparently), which seemed a bit presumptuous if you ask me.  How do you come into a situation with someone whose made life out of working with apes, and then proceed to tell them their business?  And it wasn't like his work bordered on the unethical or anything, except perhaps in the eventual disposition of the creatures.  Anyway, the real star here was the orangutan cast as `Link', as he seemed to take direction like nobody's business.  So often his expressions perfectly fit the scene making him standout above a lot of human actors currently in the business.  There were a few sequences where it was obvious there was a pint-sized human dressed up like an orangutan running around, providing a stunt double for the real deal.  I did learn a number of things from the film, including the following...

1. Elizabeth Shue is smarter than a chimpanzee monkey, but only slightly.

2. You don't want to anger an orangutan butler as they can really hold a grudge.

3. Cooking a phone in the microwave isn't good for the phone or the microwave.

4. Steer clear of water wells on isolated country estates, especially if there's a homicidal monkey butler on the loose.

5. When a monkey butler takes his coat off, it's go time.

6. Orangutans are monstrously strong, enough so to tip an automobile, pry up floorboards, or rip an arm from the socket.

7. In a battle between a wild dog and an orangutan, always bet on the latter.

8. Monkeys will eat just about anything, including rats, pigeons, and cats.

9. Beware of mail slots in doors when an angry orangutan is about.

10. Orangutans like to look at hot, nekkid women as much as I do.

As far as the direction, I thought Richard Franklin did fairly well providing some interesting shots and creating some real tension.  I still like his earlier film Roadgames (1981), with Jamie Lee Curtis, better, though.  One aspect of this production I didn't care for was the continual sense that the humans present were as stupid as they were, at least compared to the primates.  Part of this is obviously due, in my opinion, to a general underestimation by the characters of the primates intelligence, but sometimes the human characters were just plain dumb.  Had the apes been treated with some sort of chemical enhancement to make them smarter I would have been more willing to accept their ability to continually outwit the humans, but that wasn't the case here.  There are a few good scares to be had, but not really any gore (we don't actually see anyone's arm ripped from their socket).  All in all the film does have some flaws, but ultimately I found it entertaining and worth my time.

The picture, presented in widescreen (1.66:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, looks very good on this Anchor Bay Entertainment DVD release.  The Dolby Surround 2,0 audio comes through well, but it did seem a little soft at times.  As far as extras there's an original theatrical trailer, a teaser trailer, a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art along with liner notes by Michael Gingold, a managing editor of Fangoria magazine.

574603,5,6303149170,"How can anyone not enjoy a movie that has monkeys that wear clothing and smoke cigars?  Mind you these monkeys are not animatronics of computer graphics...but real trained monkeys!
This movie is basically a psychological thriller about a girl trapped in a relationship (and a house)by someone who is controlling and jealous.  But what makes this one different from all the other sob stories is this time the abuser is a monkey!
This movie has some excellent redeeming points:
 - The trained monkeys do an excellent job of creeping you out
 - The story is enjoyable
 - The acting is good
 - There are some clever death scenes
 - Elizabeth Shue is naked (briefly)

7839325,5,6303149170,"Chimps and other primates used to be quite regular actors in movies of the 70's and 80's.  Link was released in 1986.  Attitudes towards the welfare of animals in society has changed and you'll never see animal films like this made these days.  If that was remade today, the primates would be replaced by CGI, puppets and robotic models.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing that public pressure means no one wants to see animals being transported in cages between sets and living an unnatural life is a bad thing, I'm just pointing out you'll never see a film like this made today.  There are clearly rubber props used when animals are dead in this but really although Elisabeth Shue does a great job, it's the primate actors (who aren't but should have been listed in the closing credits) whose performance makes this such a great film.

The basic plot has an American (Shue) visiting a university  lecture her boyfriend is a attending.  She somehow was given misinformation that her boyfriend's lecturer wanted an assistant and plays the gender discrimination card when he points out she's a woman.  He hands her the plastic container and says well give me a sample then?  But perhaps liking what he sees, and living alone with primates in an isolated estate on a rural peninsular he decides her could do with having her around to clean up the primates waste and perform other duties, so offers her room and board and a few dollars a week.  She jumps at the chance.

Of course her perceived reality to thinking these primates will be like human young children she has looked after before just with fur, as well as her questioning the lifelong effective ways by the professor, of ensuring they know who is the alpha animal, result in the situation going downhill very fast.  To make matters worse, there are viscous wild dogs roaming the countryside (which makes little sense since they are valuable sheep in the fields), so she can't venture into town.  This is an era before mobile phones.  This is a house, where a chimp (played by an Orangutan) doesn't want it's new housemate to leave.

Spoilers - Shue's white shirt seemed to remain pretty clean considering the stuff she was enduring and there were a few noticeable things like this but it's such a fun thriller that none of this matters too much. I quite liked the score as well, but I'm a huge fan of Gremlins, composed by the same artist Jerry Goldsmith and the score reminded me of that throughout. Granted this ones score maybe made the supposed terror a bit more lighter than it perhaps it should have been.  The ending is also brilliant when you realise what you thought was the situation, wasn't it at all!",1484438400,,2669,4.64468085106383

7839329,5,6303149170,"I find this film to be very fun and highly entertaining! The fact that this film uses real animals, as opposed to the CGI technology of today,adds to the film's charm and appeal. This features Elisabeth Shue in an early role...as well a fairly short performance by Terence Stamp. This film is a horror thriller and features little on screen blood and gore...but that's okay! This movie substitutes the human 'slasher' and replaces it with a crazed animal!
To me, that's entertainment...and worth taking a look at if you haven't seen it yet!
Having seen this film, as well as, 'Shakma,' and 'Monkey Shines,' this film stands on it's own and offers a lot to this fairly small genre (killer apes/orangutans/baboons). Of the three films, this is my favorite!
This film was directed by Australian director Richard Franklin. He was a very competent director! If  you like this, I recommend his other films, 'Road Games,' 'Psycho 2,' and 'Patrick.' Link is a great movie!
The setting (filmed in Scotland) is quite beautiful...the score is strange, but fitting...and overall, I REALLY enjoy this movie!
Besides, how many movies feature an orangutan intently staring at a naked girl in a lustful and desirable gaze?!
