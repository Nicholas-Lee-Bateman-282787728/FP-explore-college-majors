1086607,5,6305907153,"I first saw ""Diamonds"" on the Hallmark Chanel on TV. It is the first movie that Kirk Douglas made after his stroke. Even after his stroke, Kirk Douglas ""still has it!"" The role of his son in the movie was originally to have been his ""real son,"" Michael; however he turned down the role. Dan Akroyd is great in the role of Kirk's son.

Diamonds is one of what I call ""feel good"" movies, which makes you want to watch it over & over again!

This was a very hard movie to find, but as usual, Amazon ""came through!"" I've found more ""hard to find"" movies with Amazon, than anywhere else! They have quick delivery, and excellent packaging!",1331942400,,633,4.3559322033898304
1086608,5,6305907153,WAS A VERY THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE GOOD MOVIE WITH KIRK DOUGLAS AND DAN AYKROYD  IT HAD A VERY UNEXPECTED COMEDY ENDING,1330992000,,116,4.8
1086609,1,6305907153,"I few years back, my film buff friends and I held our first and last annual ""Worst film festival.""  The concept: each of us would bring in our nominee for `the worst film ever made.""  The winning title was Diamonds, by my estimation the most appalling film ever made, which I discovered on a red-eye flight from Vancouver.

First there is the script, an aggregate of modern Hollywood's worst sentimental tropes and go-to clichs.  A paper-thin plot sees the retirement home hero suddenly deciding to retrieve a cash of lost diamonds.  Why he waited until his 80's to become rich remains unclear.  The diamonds of the movie's title of course serving no purpose, but to place gramps (Douglas), his estranged son (Aykroyd), and his estranged son (honestly, who cares) into a Cadillac convertible on a cross country quest, filled with stilted family drama and roadside adventures.

Up to this point, we are merely dealing with run-of-the-mill bad, but what makes Diamonds special is the WAY-TOO-SOON-AFTER-THE-STROKE casting of Douglas.  Apparently intended as a pity project for an ailing Hollywood legend, the performance powerfully conveys the creepy sensation of attending 1900's era carnival act, where drunken louts pay to through tomatoes at a gibbering, dog-faced boy.  Imagine Douglas (and believe it or not, I'm a big fan) shambling in slow-mo incoherency through establishing shots dragging the film's pacing to an un-editable crawl.  Picture if you dare, a scene where the actor, unable to form words, raise his fists above his waist, or maintain his balance, defeating a mugger to retrieve a victim's purse, like a doddering Kryptonite-shriveled Superman.  The film reaches its stupefying nadir with a multigenerational bonding session at a road-side whore-house.

I can't conceive why other raters granted 4 or 5 stars, ratings that should be reserved for movies like The Godfather or something.  My advice, avoid this film at all costs.  Or if you're thinking to yourself, ""what's this guy's problem?"" then you should watch it immediately.",1313712000,2,2049,5.2073170731707314
1086610,5,6305907153,"OUTRAGEOUS. FUNNY, DRAMA.. VERY REALISTIC TYPE MOVIE. I DONT KNOW BUT IT SURE SEEMED LIKE IT WAS A TRUE STORY ABOUT SOMEBODY.... YOUNG AND OLD WILL LOVE IT",1310688000,,155,4.571428571428571
1086611,5,6305907153,I had a stroke five years ago and anyone who has had one should watch this movie.  A great feel good movie.,1293926400,2,107,3.8636363636363638
1086612,4,6305907153,"I saw this film and recommend it. Like most of the reviewers, I enjoyed it, its sentimental, has some fine actors and gives them a chance to interact around some interesting issues, and its sentimental. Not all reviewers enjoyed it, but I'll get to that. After seeing the movie, I purchased a copy for my dad and step-mom...both in their mid 80s...they liked it too. Those who didn't appreciate it as much may have been put off by the sentimentality, seeing Kirk in the late stage of his career; maybe they don't like Lauren or Dan as much as we do...its a sort of made-for-tv movie for those old enough to appreciate the situation...an odd old jewel in an odd old setting...",1275436800,2,675,4.540983606557377
1086613,4,6305907153,"This is not a story about diamonds but a beautiful story about the father and son's bonding. It begins with the old dad played by Kirk Douglas, who always brags about having a dozen of magic diamonds hidding somewhere, worth millions of dollars. None of his children believes him. Until someday, his grandson listens and excites about it. He drags his dad (played by Dan Aykroyd) to help his grandfather to find those diamonds. Adventure begins. Throughout the journey, they not only fix up but also strengthen their father-and-son relationship all together. And eventually, they find the magic diamonds but with a twist --- a $5 cubic zirconia necklace and a deck of card printed with grandma's picture. Yet, at the end of the film, there's another twist.

Overall, this is a very good movie. It will make you laugh abit and cry abit. Just the DVD is lacking of some extra features, which only comes with closed captions, bios, and a bonus material ""The Life and Times of Kirk Douglas"".

1086614,5,6305907153,"This movie is about a old boxer played by Kirk Douglas(Oscar,Greedy), and his son Dan Aykroyd(Blues Brothers 2000,Ghostbusters). The old boxer father  wants to give his sons some diamonds. They end up on a road trip from  Canada to Reno,Nevada. The grandpa takes along Aykroyd's son on the road  trip .Upon arriving they go to a brothel run by Lauren Becall)The Mirror  Has Two Faces). All of the men each have a girlin the brothel For fans of  Dan Aykroyd he is shirtless several time he displaying his hairy chest and  flabby stomach(shouldn't he go on  diet? ) Then the party leaves after  Lauren Becall tells Kirk Douglas who and where the diamonds are. They get  the diamonds and go back home. The other brother played by Kurt Fuller is  mad about taking the dad on unauthorized trip! it has a happy ending and it  was a touching drama about family relationships and togetherness.  This  movie is rated PG-13 for nudity, swearing and sexual jokes. I do not why  this movie did make it to the mainstream theaers. It's was made by Miramax(a  divison of the Walt Disney Studios and owned by them!) . I know many people  will overlook this movie but at least we can see Kirk Douglas act after his  stroke! Jenny McCarthy(Scream3) also co-stars in this movie too!
On the  plus side, the DVD is closed captioned,has bios about the star etc,scene  choices and docementary about Kirk Douglas! On the bad side to the DVD there  is now two or pan/scan or widescreen option like ""Reindeer  Games""(another Disney movie) and no trailers for the movie or about  the movie! I liked it and I did not even see it on the big screen! Fans of  Kirk Douglas,Lauren Becall and Dan Aykroyd will be happy with this movie!",966816000,4,1702,4.5813953488372094
1086615,4,6305907153,"Kirk Douglas is one of the all time great leading men in the last century.  At 83 and having suffered a stroke, I'm sure no one ever thought he would be acting again.  Think again.  Douglas is back, and although he is  hampered somewhat by the effects of the stroke, he is as feisty, energetic  and dramatically potent as ever.
Douglas plays Harry, the patriarch of a  three-generation family in this bittersweet comedy exploring the  relationships between a father, his son and his grandson.  Harry is seen  early in the film doing exercises to recover his speech and strengthen his  facial muscles after a stroke.  A former welterweight champion, Harry tells  his son (Dan Akroyd) and grandson (Corbin Allred) that when he was younger,  he had a friend hold 13 diamonds for him, and if he could find the friend;  he could recover the diamonds.  So, the three men set out on a mission in  quest of the booty.
The story is bittersweet character study of the three  men, their relationships and misadventures.  It is a bit overly nostalgic  and the dialogue often meanders.  However, the good points outweigh the  bad.  Douglas gives a plucky performance as the aging patriarch.  This is  his film, and he dominates every scene.  His would have been an excellent  dramatic performance for anyone regardless of age and health.  When those  facts are considered, it makes the performance truly inspirational.  It  speaks volumes about Douglas' indomitable character.  It is obvious that he  worked very hard to overcome his disability and he was determined not to  let it get the best of him.  There is also some great vintage b/w footage  of Kirk Douglas, who played a prizefighter in the movie ""Champion"" (1949).
Lauren Bacall was also delightful and the scenes that she and Douglas  played together were touching and wonderful.  Bacall is still lovely,  poised and confident, and her portrayal was sensitive and powerful.  Seeing  the two of them together was like watching two masters at work.
I enjoyed  this film, even though the story and characters were somewhat unoriginal.  I rated it a 7/10.  It brought back two screen legends and more than a few  magical moments in watching them perform.",964742400,6,2198,4.871934604904633
1086616,2,6305907153,"Usually I watch movies to feel good or to be informed --- this one does neither.  It made me sad to see Kirk Douglas struggling to sound coherent after his (real-life) stroke.  To me, that was not funny for a film that's  supposed to be funny.
The only bright spot was the appearance of Lauren  Bacall who was the sexiest woman on film in the 1940's.  She must be in her  mid-seventies now, but she is still beautiful and sexy.",964051200,5,427,4.275
