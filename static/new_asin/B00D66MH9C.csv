5775120,4,B00D66MH9C,"A very well done documentary with good interviews with the people who've collaborated with Vangelis. The best parts was watching the little moments of a very private man outside of his music including his passion for painting. My only complaint is the doc did not cover any of his non soundtrack music like plays, sporting events, etc. except of course his collaboration with Jon Anderson.",1400371200,2,389,5.0

8589844,4,B00D66MH9C,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.

My main complaint is, like many other reviewers have mentioned, there is no mention of his solo works. I would've loved to hear stories about Aprhodite's Child, ""Spiral"", ""Albedo 39"", ""Heaven & Hell"", etc. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

There are plenty of good interviews both with himself and with many others and a vast insight into his work.

I thought I had heard that Vangelis was kind of a private & stand-off'ish guy, but in fact he is very affable and approachable. Very deep in his thoughts on music & life, which based on his music really isn't a surprise.

Although I've been a fan for many years, I never realized how much of his orchestrated work was done by himself and at the same time! His numerous foot pedals and endless piano set up make this possible. Very impressed. He doesn't read music and much of his stuff is created on the spot. Having music as complicated as his and not being able to read music kind of makes it hard to transcribe, although he does sometimes have someone do it after the fact for others to play behind him. Can't do EVERYTHING by himself!

In addition to the many stories & footage from his soundtracks, there is a phenomenal clip of his performing at the 1997 World Champions in Athletics in Greece. Very large and very dramatic on a par with the Olympics opening ceremonies. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.

Here's a comment lifted from Wikipedia re: this event:

""The Sport Aid (1986) TV broadcast was set to music specially composed by Vangelis.[29] He conceived and staged the ceremony of the 1997 World Championships in Athletics which were held in Greece. He also composed the music as well designed and directed the artistic Olympic flag relay portion, ""Handover to Athens"", of the closing ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.[54] While no official recording of Vangelis' composition for the 2000 Sydney Games exists, the music can be heard accompanying the presentation of the emblem of the 2004 Athens Games.""

One last thing I enjoyed about this DVD on a personal note was that after all these years I learned that his name was pronounced differently than I had thought. I always thought it was VanGELis (as in ""Gel"") but it is in fact ""VanGelis"" (as in ""Get"").",1476230400,,2307,4.651105651105651
8589845,5,B00D66MH9C,"I suppose this is one of two kinds of documentaries you could make about Vangelis -- the one where you come to appreciate him on an insider's level, as he and his work are reflected upon by movers and shakers in the arts and entertainment industries.  The other documentary, of course, would be where you talk more about the full range of his work and present his life strictly as a chronology of his life and that work.  But as it stands, this is more of the former -- an insider's expose into Vangelis' personal world -- than anything else, for whatever that's worth to you.  For me, it's worth quite a bit.

With that said, my complaints about this DVD are as follows:

1) No close-captioning of any kind on it
2) No bonus features

And to conclude these comments, I'd also like to say that I hope in future years someone makes a full-immersion video game or full-length motion picture centering around just the music of Vangelis and whatever storyline could justify the use of as much of his music as possible.  It shouldn't be a film for everyone, but it definitely be as compelling to those who would be fans of his music, as Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" or The Who's ""Tommy"".",1474848000,,1177,4.446511627906977

8589848,3,B00D66MH9C,"I'm giving Vangelis and The Journey to Ithaka 3 stars mostly for the second half of the film. The film is made by true fans of Vangelis which cuts both ways. A stronger filmmaker would've done his/her homework to create a more comprehensive film that pushed and prodded Vangelis to discuss more about his life and his composing career from the very beginning, a crucial missing piece in the film. The film also relied way too much on previous video, especially in the 80s that slowed the pacing of the film to a crawl (until Sean Connery arrived to save the day).

On the other hand, I'm glad there's a film out there about Vangelis, flawed as it is. I learned a great deal about the maestro's work as a painter and his amazing sixth sense that allows him to compose wonderful music even though he doesn't read music. Another interesting factoid about the film: Vangelis supervised a sound remix on the film.

If you're looking for the definitive documentary about Vangelis to date, this ain't it. But, it's the best we've got for now. If you're on the fence, check out other video outlets to see if it's available first or, instead, go buy a Vangelis album.",1420329600,,1158,4.5625
8589849,5,B00D66MH9C,This is a must have for all Vangelis fans out there. The DVD covers various aspect of his life and music career from childhood to present. There are plenty of interviews to enjoy and you get to see a more deeper part of this private man's life throughout the years. I only wish that the video quality was better and the video was even longer. But again i won't take anything away from this and will enjoy it for the rest of my life. I hope to see more videos about Vangelis in the future again.,1412208000,2,494,4.15625
8589850,4,B00D66MH9C,"Truly awesome in every way you could imagine...just one tiny flaw (imho), not enough coverage of very early Vangelis and his first few releases.  It's more of an overall look into the man, than a 'history' per se; but all in all a great documentary and well worth the price of a ticket!!",1409356800,2,287,4.415094339622642

8589852,4,B00D66MH9C,"This is not the Vangelis documentary I would have made! The main reason I give it four stars is that for any hardcore Vangelis fan, there is enough interesting stuff to make this a worthwhile purchase. This is not a good film to get a real over-view of Vangelis's career. There is no exploration of the Forminx, Aphrodite's Child or even any of Vangelis's solo works. The emphasis is on Vangelis's soundtrack work along with various testimonials from a handful of celebrities and Vangelis's friends. The plus side of the film are the various interview segments of Vangelis talking about his family and childhood, along with a peek into his private life. The other main plus for me was an exploration of Vangelis the painter.",1407801600,2,724,4.8
