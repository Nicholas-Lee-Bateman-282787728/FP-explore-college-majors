I loved Doctor in the House when it was briefly broadcast on some PBS outlets in the early 1970s. I had been wanting to see the whole series for a long time and hadn't really realized that it went on for many more years under various titles, in similar fashion to the Richard Gordon books (although not really based upon them).

This set is terrific and I highly recommend it.  It includes all the episodes produced by ITV (London Weekend Television) between 1969 and 1975 under the titles Doctor in the House, Doctor at Large, Doctor in Charge, Doctor at Sea, and Doctor on the Go.  The two later non-ITV produced series, Doctor Down Under (Australian TV, 1979) and Doctor at the Top (BBC, 1991) are not included, but the 137 episodes on this set will keep you busy for awhile.

Like any long-running comedy series, the quality of the individual episodes varies somewhat, but most of them are top-notch in both writing and acting.  The strong writing team includes Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, and Bernard McKenna, with occasional contributions from John Cleese and Graham Chapman.  Barry Evans starred as the boyishly naive Michael Upton in Doctor in the House and Doctor at Large.  After Evans quit, Robin Nedwell as Duncan Waring became the central character in the remaining episodes.  Geoffrey Davies as Dick Stuart-Clark and some others appear throughout the series.  All of the episodes are in color except for the first six episodes of ""Doctor at Large,"" which were made in black and white due to a labor dispute.

If you are in the U.S., you will need to get a region-free DVD player to watch this. I bought a good Samsung model on Amazon for less than 50 dollars. Worth having anyway, as you can then order any UK or European DVDs you want from Amazon UK.

Great British humor - a bargain for the price.

(Here's some interesting trivia: The episode called ""No Ill Feelings"" on disk six was written by John Cleese and broadcast in 1971 as part of the ""Doctor at Large"" series. It is set in a hotel from hell, and seems a clear precursor of ""Fawlty Towers"", which came along a few years later in 1975.)",1520294400,,2203,4.603580562659847
