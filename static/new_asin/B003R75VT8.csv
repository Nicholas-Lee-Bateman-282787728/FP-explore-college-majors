8403308,3,B003R75VT8,"Movie is 5 stars.
This Italian edition is terrible.  The color is washed out and the aspect ratio is incorrect.
Although it is the only version of this in widescreen, this is not the full OAR.
I have heard that there is no good print material for this film.  I hope this isn't true because this is the best of the Steve Reeves films and compares with the Fairbanks and Sabu versions.  They are all great different films with the same title.",1402012800,2,440,4.341463414634147

8403310,4,B003R75VT8,Fans of this movie will appreciate seeing in cinemascope for 1st time on dvd. PQ is ok but color is desaturated and it's only in Italian but still worth a purchase if your a fan and have a PAL player.,1329868800,3,200,4.025
8403311,4,B003R75VT8,"Normally, I might have only awarded three stars for this product.  However, this is the only actual DVD release of this film anywhere in the world, to my knowledge. Because of that, I'm allowing an extra star for the sheer rarity of this version of THIEF OF BAGHDAD.

As the previous reviewer stated, this disc is in Italian, with no English audio or subtitles.  However, that fact is made clear in the DVD's description.  Many of the fantasy sequences in this movie don't depend on dialog, so I believe that the lack of English is a disappointment, but not a fatal blow.  The viewer does need to have a PAL or multi-standard DVD player to watch the disc.

The DVD's image has been matted to about 1:85-1, which cheats the film's original aspect ratio of 2:35-1.  However, it is nice to have any letterboxing at all.  When compared to the old American VHS release, the matting reveals more of the special effects and the widescreen compositions, since the US VHS was panned and scanned.

Unfortunately, the color is considerably faded.  I was hoping that the Italian DVD company might have the original negative, or at least a mint 35mm print.  Again, this product is better than the old US VHS, but only somewhat better.  As a huge fan of this film, I am still searching for a properly letterboxed (CinemaScope) print with gorgeous color.",1302134400,13,1339,4.6752136752136755
