8553170,4,B00AKOMR84,"I finally saw this movie recently. The cover seems to imply a color movie but it is in black and white. One of only two movies I know about that directly concerns the Malayan communist era after WW II. It was pretty good. Lots of good action, and showed the British settlers and army garrison who were still trying to hold onto their imperial territory stolen from the Malays, not long after the allies drove Japan from their imperial territory stolen from China and the Pacific. During this time, soldiers from Britain, Australia and New Zealand were stationed in Malaya to suppress a communist uprising there. and unlike the allied force in Vietnam, they were eventually successful. This conflict continued into the early 60's I believe, even as the start of the Vietnam war. There is an awesome sequence in which a Cobra faces off against a native boy's pet mongoose. It was spectacular. The cobra was clearly outmatched, the mongoose got in the cobra's face and taunted it. Finally after several unsuccessful attempts by the cobra to strike the mongoose, which was much quicker, the mongoose grabbed the cobra by the neck and finished it off. What a pet to have! Jack Hawkins keeps trying to get his wife to leave for the safety of Britain but she won't go without him. They finally end up holed up in their home with some neighbors, fighting off a rebel attack. The picture quality looked pretty good, the sound was good enough. Wish they'd release this on a region1 disc. Otherwise, I have seen this on TCM. Another good color movie about this war is 'The 7th Dawn'.",1409270400,,1572,4.67870036101083
