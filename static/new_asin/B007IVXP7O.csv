5090150,5,B007IVXP7O,"I loved this movie. It was modern camp at its best.  Yes, the acting isn't academy award winning and the effects aren't top notch but the movie is funny as hell.  I have spent two weekends in a row showing this movie to friends and we have started quoting lines from it. If your a fan of Michael Bay, Stephen Spielberg, or the Twilight series, this won't be for you.  However, if your a fan of John Waters, Ed Wood, or the Lost Skeleton movies, this flick is ideal for the campy movie goer.",1341878400,13,490,4.191489361702128
5090151,3,B007IVXP7O,"First of all let me state that I am in no way affiliated with this project in any way nor am I related to anyone participating in it. I am a completely unbiased fan of the genre ranging from grade Z laff-a-thons to the highbrow horrors of Zulawski. If any one  of the bozos trashing this first time effort from very young people with a budget as paltry as 7,000 I'd like to see them put their money where their wide open mouths are. It was apparent to me from the onslaught that this was a spoof of the current crop of Animal monster crap seen regularly on Syfy channel as  well the drive-in stuff like Grizzly and Piranha from the 80's. The acting is amateurish but in a fun way. Everyone is in on the joke. It's certainly no worse that the stuff on SyFy from vets like Steven Baldwin and Eric roberts. These guys are just learning. Those guys have given up. The effects are bad and hilarious but on purpose. How can I tell? Because the basic movie making skills while not sophisticated are all there. THe shots are well composed,No boom mics showing up. THe film is lit  correctly, The pacing doesn't drag,The basic editing has correct coverage,the dialogue has jokes in it that works albeit at a sophomoric level ect. OK,most folks are focusing on the fact that they are using fake dime store stuffed animals,elobrate sock pruppets to mutilate and  awful CGI that ranges somewhere between the horrid  GIF's of Birdemi:SHock And Terror and the goofy caricatures of Two Headed Shark Attack. THis movie does what it's supposed to do and that it be fun and rediculous . THankskilling cost about three times as much  and was not quite as successful as this. Every body is entitled to their own opinion but if you go to you tbe to the making of Rise Of TheANimals you can see these teens having fun,doing their job and pushing forward responsibly regardess of the sillyness of the film. Anyone who can get an indie film off the ground in this horrible economy earns my respect even if I don't care for it very it very much and this was fun. Get of your high horse and laugh.

5090153,1,B007IVXP7O,"After infiltrating an all girl's slumber party in a remote cabin, Wolf, an awkward pizza delivery driver spends a passionate evening with a beautiful teen named Samantha. The next morning Samantha is gone, and the cabin in the woods is attacked by a family of deer. After a brutal massacre the cabin is bathed in the blood and gruesome remains of deer and teenage girl. Wolf, his best friend Jake, and Jake's sister Rachel are the only ones left standing. Wolf finds Samantha's cell phone amidst the blood bath, and the trio set out on an epic, cross-country journey to return the lost phone to the girl of Wolf's dreams. As animals across the globe turn on humanity and society quickly collapses into chaos, Wolf's determined spirit pushes him forward against all odds. But is she worth it?

Yes, they use puppets, and the blood splatter is over the top excessive, but that's the point, it's meant to be ridiculous.

The special effects was limited and the animal actors not prepared for this production.  It has potential but not in this production.
I used to watch the Zoo on TV, but it proved to be repetitive and revolved in a circle, no one is eliminated from the version.  The same characters seem to survive and the new characters get eaten or dies!

The movie is obviously meant to be comedic but somehow also carries a air of seriousness. Everyone involved takes the script, the acting and (very) special effects seriously.

People are dying and instead of hunkering down he is trying to get this gal her cell back.
ASSUMING you are still here after that, let's look at effects. They used a stuff cat when a cat was hit into the sink and killed, hand puppets for when the psycho deer. A gorilla costume glove for when it gets an arm cut off. They use a Halloween foam arm when a guy is getting eaten. And when there are special fx, well they look terrible, even for a B Movie.

The film opens with a scene of a person being killed by a rabbit. The rabbit is obviously a stuffed animal. The type you might buy a 4 year old for a present.

The hero is a pizza delivery boy named Wolf (ponder) who both falls in love and must save humanity in a globe thrown into chaos (or something like that...just read the liner notes for yourself.) If love and mutant animals add up to anything, you know it's the selective use of atomic weapons, right? Of course.

The film itself is made by amateurs and your expectations should be tempered accordingly. If you are watching it to be actually scared you are in the wrong place; likewise if you are expecting some kind of brilliant indie horror piece, you need to bail out now.

This movie probably shouldn't get three stars, but I actually watched it all and laughed at it.  Grant you the special effects are what take away from it.  Afterall stuffed animals and hand puppets don't take the place of real animals or CGI.  They do have a couple CGI animals including a gorilla and a tentacle monster (Squid or Octopus?) that wasn't bad.  They realized this stuff was laughable and so they even throw buckets of blood on people to say yeah we get this is a cheap budget but we're trying.  I suggest you rent it and don't have any preconception that it is going to be more than a low budget B SciFi, but it is funny.  Actually the more I see it the more I like it. I'm sure it will develop a cult following. There need to be more horror comedies like this. I would love to see a remake with a big budget.

P.S. Stop trashing this movie it's fun and let's see you do better on this budget!

I'm a fan of grade B horror.  This doesn't come close to that.  Nobody in this movie makes a serious effort to do a good job.  They just cop out before making a serious effort and use the excuse that it's supposed to be funny.

I stopped watching about a third of the way through when essentially nothing had happened (except in the opening sequence) other than two losers with no charisma (the protagonist and his side kick) get lost while driving around and then eventually find the house where they deliver pizza to some okay looking drunk chicks who also lack on screen presence.

One of the girls looked like she could have been a decent actress under competent direction, but competent direction is one of the many things this movie lacked.

5090263,1,B007IVXP7O,"RISE OF THE ANIMALS (2011) - Here's a film that is so bad, I'm embarassed to say I watched it. It has CGI (by Chris Vranos) that makes the work done by Scott Coulter for those SyFy Original Movies look like James Cameron films, puppets (by Jacob T. Emery) that make the Muppets look human, physical gore effects that must have cost $1.99, a screenplay that could be written on one side of a napkin (and a used napkin at that), a music soundtrack that makes director Chester T. Turner's BLACK DEVIL DOLL FROM HELL (1984) Casio soundtrack sound like a John Williams orchestra and acting so horrendous, even kindergarten children would boo and hiss. For reasons not explained (why bother?), animals of all types begin attacking and killing humans, as we witness by the first scene where a mother is attacked by her cat, so she hits it (an obvious stuffed animal) with a frying pan and stuffs it down the kitchen sink garbage disposal (Would a cat even fit in the drain?). She the goes outside to save her son, only to be attacked and killed by a dog (a real one that wags its tail and looks about as harmless as a baby holding a sledgehammer), the son having a bucket of blood thrown on him with the wagging tail dog chasing him. We then meet pizza delivery boy Wolf (Greg Hoople) and his best friend Jake (Adam Schonberg), who have to make one more delivery way out in the woods before they can go to the movies (Wouldn't Wolf have to return the money to his pizza joint before he does anything else?). They reach their destination, a cabin in the woods where an all-girl slumber party is going on (What are the chances?), where Jake's sister Rachel (Stephanie Motta) and Wolf's childhood crush Samantha (Nicole Salisbury) are attending (What are the chances?). Lying that their van has broken down, Wolf and Jake ask the girls if they can spend the night (They say yes, because all girls are horny.) and Wolf takes Samantha out to the van, where they make out. The next morning, Wolf wakes up in the van and Samantha is gone, but she left her phone behind with a message that she was picked up by someone else and could he please return her phone. The girls inside the cabin are attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty deer (really bad puppets) who break through the balsa wood-thin walls and begin chowing down on the females (You can actually imagine someone just off camera throwing buckets of fake blood on the bodies). Wolf, Jake and Rachel take the van and get out of Dodge, but Wolf wants to stop at Jake and Rachel's house to pick up a charger for Samantha's phone (Rachel and Samantha have the same model), since the phone died before he could get the address where Samantha is. After almost being shot by his grandfather for changing his shirt and rushing out the door (!), Wolf and the duo head for Samantha, when a gorilla jumps on the van's roof (a terrible CGI creation) and tries to rip out Rachel's throat before Wolf closes the automatic window and cuts off the gorilla's hand (Which brings up the questions: Where the hell did the gorilla come from? Can an automatic window closing actually cut off a hand? Why would they have the windows open in the first place?). They are forced to travel by canoe, where they are attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty turtles (really bad puppets and you can see the rods that control them) in the water. They finally make it to Samantha, only for Wolf to discover that she already has a boyfriend. They are all attacked by a bear (another horrible CGI creation), killing Jake, Samantha and her boyfriend before Rachel cuts its head off with a sword. Wolf and Rachel decide to head east to Florida, but Wolf drives towards the sunset. When Rachel reminds him that the sun sets in the west, Wolf says ""F*** it."" THE END. All this badness lies directly on the shoulders of director/writer/editor/co-producer Chris Wojcik, this being his first full-length feature fim directorial effort. If there is a God in Heaven, this will be his last, but since I am an athiest, I wouldn't count on it. The entire film screams how cheap it is, from the photography (by Jeremiah Franco, also a co-producer), special effects (the gunshots sound like cap pistols), common sense (Rachel gets out of the van at one point and decides to walk home. This just after witnessing all her girlfriends being slaughtered by the puppet deer.) and the music (by ""Federal! State!Local!""), especially the end credits song, which sounds like it was recorded in someone's bathroom. The whole film was meant to be a comedy, but the line readings by the entire cast makes it sound like a third-rate vaudeville comic telling jokes to a drunk, sparse audience. Do yourself a favor and get a colonoscopy, because it will feel better than watching this film. Believe me when I say this is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing (and I have seen thousands).

Didn't like the CGI, in most places.  But I guess it was easier and faster than doing a puppet for it.  Nothing topped the cat from the first scene, though, because they used a real cat initially, and replaced it with a fluff ball.  Few movies have treated cats like they really should be!  (kidding!)

5090278,4,B007IVXP7O,"You can never go wrong using puppet effects for a movie.  Totally cheesy, totally lame and totally awesome.  I actually thought this movie was pretty decent.  It is worth watching once.  Maybe twice, or possibly three times.  Buckets of blood, bad special effects and cheesy acting.  All in all well worth your time.  If you don't like cheese you won't like it, if you like B movies you will like this.",1362268800,10,402,4.577464788732394
5090279,2,B007IVXP7O,"This movie was all over the place. It had horrible graphic effects and the plot was lacking. It would have been better without so much of the crappy computer animations in it. The over acting took from the movie. However, it was hilarious in parts. I would have to say this should have been under horror/comedy sections rather than action.",1362268800,,339,4.666666666666667

5090281,5,B007IVXP7O,"I LOVED this movie. Granted, the effects are ridiculous. The plot is ludicrous, and the action scenes are absurd. But the acting is, while low key, genuine. The plot is basic, but well paced. The actors didn't go nuts and over-act, they stayed within their roles and came off as real people walking through an absurd background situation. There is a sense of fun in almost every scene, and you can feel that the people making this put everything they had (though not a lot of money) into it.

I'm a big fan of bad movies, I've survived everything from Troll 2 to Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter. But this isn't that kind of bad. It's just really low budget, kind of ridiculous, and really fun.",1360022400,24,690,4.52
5090282,5,B007IVXP7O,This is a good movie. i have to give props to the filmmakers. this was a first time movie for these guys and they did not do a bad job. the storyline is pretty good. but like everyone says you can tell that all the special effcts are bad. what else can you do on such a low budget. i did not find this movie scary at all but i found it funny. and thats what i think the filmmakers wrere aiming for. this was something they wanted to do out of fun and to see if they could get anywhere with it. i give all my respect to indie films and thier creators. the acting was pretty good i think those actors might have a good future ahead of them. this movie is not intended to be a hollywood blockbuster. i love indie films. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do. and p.s. this is alot better than some hollywood movies.,1350518400,4,830,3.9760479041916166

It seemed like it just kind of went on and on for awhile. If you are a fan of the absurd, cheesey, b-movies then they is for you! If you are looking for award winning acting or at least capable of being nominated for an award in any category, you should probably stay away from this film!

8518044,2,B007IVXP7O,"Super-low budget indy camp, somewhat saved by its use of buckets of blood. Still, strip away the camp and the story is thinner than a New York pizza. The cleverness and originality that can overcome the lack of money for special effects or cameras and mics is mostly missing here. It's as if a few average grad school film student friends thought they could get by with a tired story and lazy production by winking at the audience. It doesn't help if we're all in on the joke if the joke itself is weak and not improved by being in on it.",1477180800,,538,4.284313725490196
