The Children s Hour is a hard look at what a vicious lie can lead to.

8411642,4,B00402FGKI,"My sister requested this old movie, since she couldn't find it.  I am glad to say I found it on Amazon.  it was better to get the whole 3-movie package than just the one movie, so I did.

8411644,5,B00402FGKI,"I enjoyed all three movies. They're suppose to be classics and are old so none are in color. Two feature Shirley MacLaine, and she's a real good actress, who I didn't really know about. I just formally knew her as the New Age woman who was in Terms Of Endearment. Audrey Hepburn is in her classic best in Chidren's Hour, as she was the reason I bought this collection. The Bishop's Wife is a good movie, as long as you understand Cary Grant's character isn't the bad guy trying to steal the wife. Because there does seem a little love triangle thing going on. The Apartment is enjoyable, even though I predicted the ending, but it's still good enough to watch again. It's a great value to collect these three movies here.",1320451200,4,721,4.46969696969697

SYNOPSES--

THE CHILDREN'S HOUR
In this excellent adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play, Hepburn and MacLaine are best friends who run a boarding school for girls. One of their students (Balkin) spreads the rumor that her teachers are lovers, a vicious untruth that destroys the two womens' reputations, business and personal lives.

Hepburn breaks up with boyfriend Garner when he doubts her truthfulness. MacLaine, who is forced to face a reality about herself, is so distraught something awful is bound to happen and it does.

THE BISHOP'S WIFE
Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven) is trying to raise funds for a cathedral, but he's confounded by Mrs. Hamilton  (Cooper), a curt, wealthy widow and primary donor who wants the edifice to be a memorial to her late husband. When Henry prays for Divine guidance, an angel named Dudley (Grant) appears.

A side story concerns Prof. Wutheridge, delightfully portrayed by Monty Woolley. He's an aging, atheistic historian with a severe case of writer's block (been working on the same history of Rome for 20 years).

Dudley gets involved in everyone's lives, bringing joy to all he comes in contact with except the man who conjured him up, the bishop. Partially scripted by Billy Wilder and Robert Sherwood, this Xmastime story is filled with magic, a few neat special effects, and lots of love.

THE APARTMENT--
In an attempt to climb the corporate ladder, lower echelon insurance exec Buddy Baxter allows his superiors to use his flat for extra-marital affairs. While the apartment is scheduled for occupancy one night, Buddy invites elevator operator Fran Kubelik, a girl he's interested in, to see a play with him. Buddy's unaware that Fran is girlfriend to the personnel manager who's arranging his promotion in return for his passkey. Fran and Mr. Sheldrake will be using his apartment regularly now that Buddy has obtained that coveted executive position.

Buddy is thrilled to see Fran at the company Christmas party until he figures out her relationship with Sheldrake, who once again has his front door key. Dejected, Buddy leaves the party and gets drunk at a nearby bar with a gal named Margie while Fran meets Sheldrake at his apartment. When Buddy and Margie arrive at his place much later, he discovers that Fran is still there and that she's taken an overdose of sleeping pills. Not knowing her despondency is caused by being a married man's mistress, the doctor who saves Fran's life wrongly blames Buddy for this suicide attempt.
