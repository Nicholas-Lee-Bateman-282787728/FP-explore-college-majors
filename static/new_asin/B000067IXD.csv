7962968,1,B000067IXD,I showed it to my husband as a joke. Thinking this would be a funny movie to watch...NO both fell asleep during the movie.,1471996800,,122,4.125
7962969,2,B000067IXD,"This movie was dissapoiinting to me. With the previous reviews so positive I expected more. The two problems are the silly story line and the lack of sexual heat betwem Misty and her vampire,Tina Krause. Tina Krause was a dissapointment,despite he impressive chest. Also Bill Hellfire the director, inserts himself in to the movie where his ability to act is sadly lacking .Hellfire is Ok if he sticks to the comic roles but he added nothing to this film.

A quick synopsis of the plot failures. We meet Misty walking around Paris, right of the plane, carrying her suitcase looking for her dead mother's grave. She  was a drug addict. Then she is seen wandering around without going to her hotel and checking in so she could get rid of her baggage. She is approached by a slimebag dressed in a white suit and long black pony tail. He asks her is she has ""some spare change"".Where I grew up this request indicates that the guy is broke and Misty rightly ignors him and walks away .Then he chases after her and tells her he has diamonds for sale! She now shows an interest! He takes her below the arches of a large bridge and attempts to rape her with people everywhere on a bare cement side walk! Then he hears sirens and runs away with her purse and luggage.

I will go no further .The rest is just as stupid. Another movie included with Debbie Rochon as the lead role (Purgatory Blues) is also absurd. Honest to god ,can't hellfire find someone to write a plausable scipt! Another work ,the Erotic Vampire in London ,at least made sense,and had sosme hot encounters that we all enjoy. Misty and Tina Krause have no fire betwen them and shouldn't be cast together. As a matter of fact Tina Krause shouldn't be in any movie because she can't act! She has one expression: dull and void.

All in all a waste of time and money. Don't bother with it.",1322006400,,1845,4.465875370919881
7962970,3,B000067IXD,"Paris was not featured in this film; however the city was, and some beautiful shots, I might add.  It's soft-cover porn.  Lovely, Misty Mundee has an erotic-nerdish quality about her that is both entertaining and unique.  Great movie for both men and women who find a sexual relationship between two lovely women erotic.  The plot.....what can I say, it's lame, not scary, and the only actress w/ real potential is Misty.  Let's be honest.  People don't get this movie for intellectual stimulation or sensation of fear. I watched the whole movie once and now, only replay my favorite scenes when I have little to do and the wife and kids are away.",1296172800,,647,4.732142857142857
7962971,5,B000067IXD,"If you are a Misty Mundae and Tina Krause Fan,, you will love this dvd movie, it is entirely filmed in Paris, the scenery is beautiful, the music used for background makes you feel you are walking right along with Misty and Tina soaking in the French Ambiance. The love relationship deleloped between Misty a young girl visiting Paris for her mother's funeral,, which blossoms with Tina Krause, (Isabel the Erotic Vampire of Paris) is mesmorizing. Tina (Isabel) falls in love with Caroline (Misty) and wants to spend the rest of her life with her,, but throughout the movie, Isabel cannot bring herself to put the bite on Caroline (Misty) until the end, ,. This movie has a good strong plot, easy to follow, and both Misty and Tina do a very serious great job of acting. When Misty and Tina are in a tub scene with a pervert nerd type dude that is hitting on Misty,, the look on Misty's face is priceless, like she is saying get this creepazoid off me, yukk,, and she gets out of the tub and tells Isabel, (Tina ) you can have him,,, a very compelling movie, very erotic lesbian scenes between Misty Mundae and Tina Krause( aka: Mia Copia) One of the best movies I have seen in awhile which both incorporates great acting and very Erotic Lesbian love scenes between two great B movie actresses,, Misty Mundae and Tina Krause(Mia Copia).. I highly recommend this movie and give it a 5 star rating...",1172102400,,1398,4.551587301587301
7962972,4,B000067IXD,this was not only a good story but it has some very sexy scenes with misty mundae. also some very interesting behind the scenes with misty on her first time in paris.,1123027200,2,166,4.21875
7962973,5,B000067IXD,"An Erotic Vampire in Paris is several cuts above your typical Seduction Cinema film.  The eroticism is very subdued and far from graphic, while the storyline is actually quite serious and atmospheric.  Misty Mundae shines in her dramatic portrayal of the innocent young girl Caroline who has journeyed to Paris to pay her respects to her recently deceased mother.  After a somber scene at the gravesite, Caroline finds herself attacked and robbed by a stranger.  With no money and almost no hope to speak of, she is taken in by the strange but mesmerizing Isabel (played by Mia Copia aka Tina Krause), whom we (being the audience) already know to be a vampire.  The budding relationship is a strange one, with Isabel assuming an authority role at first by making Caroline eat off of the floor like a dog, but the two women come to develop a loving relationship of sorts.  There is one memorable scene reflecting a vivid internal struggle in Isabel, as she bares those nice fangs of hers only to hold back each time she reaches the brink of  piercing Caroline's throat.  We watch the strange relationship between vampire and vulnerable young lady grow, but the whole effect of the film is somewhat diminished by a scene in which the ladies allow a super-geek to follow them home and join them in the bathtub.  Personally, I don't like seeing the grubby hands of a male touching Miss Mundae, especially such geeky hands as this fellow possesses.  The movie does recover and finish quite strongly, culminating in a scene that rather surprised and certainly impressed me.
While one sees plenty of Misty in her birthday suit throughout this film, An Erotic Vampire in Paris is really not very sexually explicit.  There is really only one scene involving the sort of provocative lesbian encounters one is accustomed to in a film of this sort.  Thus, the viewer just wanting to see soft porn may well be disappointed.  As a horror fan, I was quite impressed with the look and feel of the vampiric blood feasts.  Copia does a great job of bearing her fangs and impaling them on the tender necks of her victims, and there is a satisfying amount of blood as a result.  Still, though, I would classify this as drama more than erotic horror.  The range of emotions shown by Misty Mundae distinguishes her as a serious dramatic actress, and it is her wonderful performance that makes this film as compelling and mesmerizing as it most certainly is.",1049068800,21,2435,4.734597156398104
7962974,5,B000067IXD,"Actually a decent movie! Misty Mundae is terrific and if your a fan, this is MUST own!
Thank you GOD! For creating Misty!",1038960000,,121,4.304347826086956
7962975,5,B000067IXD,"Misty Mundae fans will love this VERY erotic lesbian vampire film. For a change, the entire movie was made in Paris and takes full advantage of the historic settings to stage Misty's lesbian encounters. One scene is even filmed INSIDE Notre Dame Cathedral - I wonder how they got permission to do that? Another highlight is Misty and an actress named Mia Copia having a lesbian session inside a ferris wheel while it's going around. If you like European made erotic vampie films like THE BLOOD SPLATTERED BRIDE or REQUIEM FOR A VAMPIRE, this compares very highly with those and is one of the best I've seen!",1022284800,14,607,4.682242990654205
