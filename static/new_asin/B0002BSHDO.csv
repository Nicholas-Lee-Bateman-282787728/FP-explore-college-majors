2075827,5,B0002BSHDO,I brought my Mom on a trip to Iceland last year.  She kept saying how much she loves to think back on the trip so I purchased this for her.  She says she looks at it often and feels like she's back in Reykjavik.,1180828800,,211,3.772727272727273
2075828,1,B0002BSHDO,"I bought this DVD hoping to get some ideas for outdoor expeditions for an upcoming trip to Iceland.  Instead, there were gory scenes such as a reindeer getting its throat slit after being shot, and a scene of a bloody, skinned seal.  I had to press the stop button on the DVD player before it was over.  (As an aside, don't bother buying this if your main interest is Iceland - the majority of the program -- including the scenes referenced above -- is focused on Greenland.)

Definitely not for children or animal-friendly adults!",1113264000,18,531,4.617021276595745
2075829,4,B0002BSHDO,"As opposed to the only other review, I must take an opposing view of this fascinating video.  Perhaps I find Ian Wright a charmer as his personality and appearance match those of me and my friends, so his trip journey these north countries felt as though being relayed by a good pal.  My only qualm is that I wished the trip were longer.  The DVD quality is good and watching Wright trying to navigate a kayak, eat fresh raw fish (nowhere attractively prepared as sashimi)drinking ""black death"", nude mud bathing, and dog sledding 'cross the frozen tundra, you'd wish you were there.

A highly watchable, sometimes laugh-out-loud, travel video and I look forward to more Globe Trekkers with Mr. Wright!

2075830,1,B0002BSHDO,"I purchased this DVD hoping to see highlights of Greenland and Iceland, but the movie comes off looking like a bad music video (circa 1990) with ultra-stylized, grainy scenes with flashy effects and jerky camera movements.  When I played the DVD it annouced it was Rated ""G,"" but that must have meant ""gross"" due to the explicit scenes of a man hunting reindeer, seeing it stumble to the ice, and seeing the man slit its throat and disembowling it.  Whereas I know this may be typical life in Greenland, it didn't have to be shown in such disturbing detail. The bulk of the movie simply depicts Wright prancing around in the snow.  Don't waste your money!",1108080000,22,655,4.629310344827586

Jamaica that i have ever seen. Please don't

to know about this beautiful island.",1390867200,,161,4.0625

8025818,3,B0002BSHDO,"This dvd showed the less than glamorous side of Jamaica and its people.  It did not excite me about traveling to that island.  There was not one beautiful waterfall or lagoon scene.  Lots of views of bad roads, bad transportation, less than appealing 'restaurants', negative commentaries from tourists as well as the 'globe trekker' himself.  The last scene of a carnival-type celebration was almost obscene.  The 3 stars given because of the reality of the dvd.",1247097600,5,462,5.026315789473684
8025819,4,B0002BSHDO,"This was originally a 1996 episode of ""Lonely Planet"". Some of the material in this DVD might seem a bit dated to those who have recently visited Iceland and/or Greenland. What should have been done was to make two complete episodes: one episode on Iceland and one episode on Greenland. After all, these are two very different worlds, and yet they are so close to each other! Iceland is very technologically modern and culturally sophisticated -- just like continental Western Europe. Greenland is still an enigma for most people. This gigantic island, whose surface is over 95% covered in glacial ice, is home to an ancient,  fascinating, and hearty people with a long history of nomadic tradition and survival skills. I find both lands intriguing and would love to visit both of them!

Regarding Ian Wright: I have read many negative reviews about him from other episodes he has hosted. He is neither Rick Steves nor Burt Wolf, folks! Ian Wright is simply being himself -- a silly but fun-loving, young Englishman who loves to travel. He is adventurous, curious, and keen to try practically anything once, even if he looks rediculous doing it. He is much more lively and likable than that uptight Justine Shapiro! She is so deadpan serious, cranky, and whiney that she would be a miserable travelling companion! And what about Megan McCormick? Yes, I think she is cute -- however, at times she behaves like such a ditzy airhead!

And for that obnoxious, homophobic reviewer of the ""Globe Trekker: Brazil"" DVD -- Yes, Ian Wright IS gay! SO WHAT! BIG DEAL! GET OVER IT -- AND GET A LIFE!",1243728000,4,1587,4.7846715328467155
8025820,1,B0002BSHDO,"Poorly produced product and narrated by man who should try another part of the world to make a travelogue on.  He totally misses the geo-political situation that present day Greenland is faced with, now and in the future.  His interviews were solely with Iniuts, Eskimos who were Nomads and came and settled here from Siberia and Mongolia centuries ago.  The real development of Greenland was written by the Norsemen.  Denmark still controls Greenlands' foreign relations and is still economically tied to.
No European adminitrators or historians were interviewed.

Greenland's role in WW-II is not even mentioned nor its present day role as being a vital role player in the North American Defenese Command with Thule AFB.  Fishing is under-mentioned and mining potential is ignored.

Airline and airports are ignored as well the postal boat services and summer cruise ship calls.  The producers did little research of their
project.

Iceland was likewise dealt with in a fluffy back handed way, lacking the same absence of serious-minded commentary.

The narrators english is heavily laced with a cockney twist, somewhat out of place in this setting.  The last straw was his rumpled clothing and his visor cap backwards all of the time.  What was this man thinking of?",1242777600,2,1269,5.136585365853659
8025821,3,B0002BSHDO,"I thought the video was average. I wished they had spent more time on Iceland and less on Greenland (more visit Iceland by far). I did like Ian the host. Now after visiting Iceland on two ocassions (planning a 3rd trip next year) I realize there is so much more to do in the country then what they presented in the video....but worth it for those who might be on the fence trying to decide whether or not to visit the country. BTW, its worth the trip, what a fantastic country!!",1215561600,,478,4.263736263736264
8025822,4,B0002BSHDO,"I could do without some of the camera silliness, but other than that I thought it was a great program. Ian Wright always does a vastly better job of showing the country he is visiting than the folks who followed him, many of the later shows seem like nothing but a guide to the bars and shopping in the countries visited. Ian certainly leaves you with a feel for how the places really are.

I can understand that the squeamish can't stand the blood and guts in this show, but the intention is to show these places as they are, and it does that. This is frontier land, they don't get their meat at macdonalds, already cooked and wrapped in paper. If you can't handle that, tough luck.",1187568000,,683,4.3359375
