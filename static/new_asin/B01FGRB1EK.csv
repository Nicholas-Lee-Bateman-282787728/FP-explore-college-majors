7749925,4,B01FGRB1EK,A creepy classic,1444348800,,16,4.666666666666667
7749926,4,B01FGRB1EK,Love this movie. It takes a different spin on Hansel and Gretal.,1442102400,,64,4.416666666666667
7749927,3,B01FGRB1EK,Just a funny little movie. Shelley Winters Is a Hoot In this!,1407888000,,61,4.166666666666667
7749928,2,B01FGRB1EK,"I love old movies and I love Shelley Winters. I don't recall ever seeing or even hearing about this movie, so I rented it here on Amazon. The story is basically Hanzel and Gretel set in somewhat modern times. It's sort of a G-rated horror movie, but I think ""horror"" is too harsh -- let's say ""scary"" movie -- if your about 7 years old. I know we're all a little more desensitized to violence and horror than we were when this movie was made (early 1970s), but there are no real surprises or plot twists. The only reason for the 2 stars is that I like seeing Shelley Winters on screen.",1390953600,,585,4.232142857142857
7749929,4,B01FGRB1EK,"Oh my gosh, I remember seeing this as a child, and while I wasn't exactly scared, I do remember thinking Shelly Winters was creepy.  This is a cult classic and holds up over time.  They really don't  make them like this now; watch it, with your kids, you'll like it.  I don't have any kids but if I did I'd have them watch it.",1369958400,,326,4.046875
7749930,4,B01FGRB1EK,"Shelley Winters is absolutely fabulous as a widowed mother (of a creepy dead child that shows up a lot) who becomes interested in an orphan from a nearby home.  The plot moves fairly well, and the ending has a great twist.",1366329600,2,222,4.414634146341464
7749931,1,B01FGRB1EK,"If you find bad acting scary, along with insipid direction and clumsy screenplays, this is one scary movie. But if you want anything more than cheesy camp, this offers nothing of value.",1365897600,,185,4.8125
8760758,5,B01FGRB1EK,"Definitely a classic. I remember going to the theatre and watching this as a kid with my mom. For weeks we'd ask each other, ""Whoever slew Auntie Roo?"" And respond, ""Only the teddy bear knew!"" Shelly at her best psycho self. Loved her.",1530921600,,235,4.488372093023256
8760759,1,B01FGRB1EK,Was not what I expected,1524787200,,23,3.8
8760760,5,B01FGRB1EK,"You can tell Shelley Winters loved playing every minute of this character!  A complete nutter that you pity one minute and can't stand the next.  The children are perfect and the style of the movie (the mansion, wardrobe, etc.) is incredible.  A great spooky/suspenseful Holiday movie!",1515369600,,285,5.1521739130434785
8760761,4,B01FGRB1EK,"During this period there was a slew of demented broad pictures with various titles such as Let's Scare Jessica To Death, What's The Matter With Helen, Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice, etc. and this fits the picture with Shelley Winters giving her finest performance as demented rich lady tormented by the loss of her beloved relative in search for someone to fill the gap and stopping at no end to get it. The title makes no sense since the end tragedy was figured by the police as an accidental incident.",1503878400,,505,4.622222222222222
8760762,5,B01FGRB1EK,"Such a great underrated gem of a film!  It's kind of scary, kind of charming, and kind of funny.  It will really leave an impact on you mentally.  A+ film all the way!",1502755200,,167,4.0
8760763,5,B01FGRB1EK,odd little tale about a crazed lady desiring a child/daughter of her own... with a twist of course. I enjoy strange little mild horror tales like this every once and awhile. The acting is ok and it's pretty fun when the mood is right.,1489276800,,234,4.340909090909091
8760764,5,B01FGRB1EK,Very good movie. Kids will enjoy it,1483488000,,35,4.142857142857143
8760765,1,B01FGRB1EK,very bad movie,1482883200,,14,4.0
8760766,4,B01FGRB1EK,"with a great performance by Shelley Winters, who truly seems to live the role. Recommended!",1472601600,,91,5.133333333333334
8760767,5,B01FGRB1EK,"I absolutely love this movie. I watch it every Christmas and beyond. Shelly Winters is brilliant as the civilized wicked witch type woman who has lost a daughter to an accident. This is a clever retelling of Hansel and Gretel in a different time period setting. The Christmas atmosphere is warm and colorful, the children are great actors (note that Mark Lester from ""Oliver"" 1968 is one of the lead kids who was a master at his craft of acting and the adorable Cloe Franks as his kid sister of whom Shelly Winters character wants to replace her daughter. A must for Hansel and Gretel fans and a wonderful horror movie to see at Christmas time or any other time of the year.",1463875200,3,674,4.487804878048781
