4155466,2,B003MQYK46,"I started watching Spike with an open mind, but it quickly became one of the most disappointing movies that I've seen this year.

The film follows the story of four friends who find themselves in an ominous forest after a tire blowout.  They come face to face with a beast that shares a connection with one of them.

The good news is that the costume design is great.  For being a low-budget flick, the overall video quality was better than most Redbox movies.

The bad news is that the movie is just boring.  Lots of mediocre acting, laughably bad animal scenes, minimal gore, and the most annoyingly emo monster in film history.  The romantic dialogue is corny, and the film's pacing is awful.  To make matters worse, Amazon and IMDB both are completely littered with fake positive reviews for the film.

Beauty and the Beast has left the building.  Normally I'd suggest that people rent a movie before deciding to buy it, this is one occasion when I'll suggest passing on it altogether.",1289347200,5,989,4.664739884393064

4155468,3,B003MQYK46,"SPIKE is a love story w/ a tragic, spiny mutant in it. It's sort of a cross between BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (EDWARD THISTLEHANDS?) w/ a bit more blood. I did enjoy the female characters, including a tough, resourceful chick w/ medical knowledge. There's also a guy who spends most of the movie on his back, bleeding. As for the ""monster"" himself, he's an emotional wreck, unable to get past the lost love of his life. Is it sappy? Yes. Does it drag on? Yes. Is it a complete catastrophe? No. I liked the beginning and the ending. The middle part gets long-winded, meandering a lot. If this had been about 20-30 minutes shorter, it could have been a classic... P.S.- The thorny suit of the title creature is pretty cool...",1287532800,4,742,4.544776119402985
4155469,1,B003MQYK46,"Spike is by no means a horror film.  It's a bizarre love story, a tragic fairy tale, and/or a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  For all you gorehounds out there, this film is pretty much garbage.  Sorry, it's like making love to a cactus.

I suffered and took one for the team.  Now I'll make this quick and painless.  A group of people have a tire blow out in the woods and get attacked by a thorny monster.  Well, actually they aren't attacked, this poor spiked freak just wants to be loved.  His inability for human interaction is so sad.

This prickly idea might have stood a chance if it wasn't for the retarded dialogue.  (Thorn man speaking to woman with rose belt)--""His love of 80 years couldn't compare to my love of just one day"".  Gag!  Maybe I am just an insensitive prick, but that fiercely grated on my nerves.  Throw in the fact this had no real sense of danger or suspense after the first half hour, and this movie drastically misses the mark.  Well, I suppose I am not the target audience.

SPIKE would have been cool as a gory comedy.  Several rape scenes with heavy sarcasm would have been hilarious.  Or a misunderstood monster wallowing in self-pity as his dates get poked in more ways than one.  Maybe play some MC Hammer ""Can't touch this"" in the background.  That would have been awesome.

Okay, sorry to poke fun.  This film is for chick flick fans only.",1286841600,3,1382,4.426294820717131
4155470,5,B003MQYK46,"I saw this movie at its US premiere- I was enchanted! Especially well- directed and acted by Ed Gusts as the monster and Sarah Livingston Evans as The Girl, they have an undeniable onscreen chemistry. Pretty dark, twisty fantasy-world stuff!",1277337600,4,241,5.05
4155471,5,B003MQYK46,"This Horror Film twist on ""Beauty and the Beast"" is an instant classic. It's love story undertone isn't to heavily masked by the gore. I wanted this seemingly horrible creature to end up with the girl. Awesome flick.

4155472,5,B003MQYK46,"It's not quite a monster movie -- although there is a monster, and oh my yes he is covered in spikes -- but imagine combining ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" with ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" or ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death,"" and you'll get an idea. Full of dream-logic, haunting imagery and heartrendingly authentic emotions, ""Spike"" is the nightmare you don't realize you're having until you wake sweating, glancing frantically at your window to make sure the sun is up.

4155478,2,B003MQYK46,"Three girls and a guy (2 couples) crash their car due to a blow out. The guy (Jared Edwards) gets injured while being outside the car and has a spike in his neck. His girlfriend springs into first aid action and applies the proper first aid, something rarely done in movies. She even constructs a stretcher out of skis and a sleeping bag. Meanwhile there is a porcupine man (Edward Gusts in the title role) running about who speaks in poetic lines.

The movie is a weird Beauty and the Beast love triangle. As it turns out Spike and the girl (Sarah Livingston Evans) were childhood friends who became separated. The movie is boring and shot at night so the scenes at fairly dark. While there are a total if 5 characters in the film, he centers around 2 of them. You keep waiting for something to happen, but it is more of a drama than a horror.

F-bomb, 2 girls briefly kissing, nudity (Sarah Livingston Evans), no sex thank goodness.",1334534400,2,934,4.456140350877193

4155480,2,B003MQYK46,"It's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but there's a lot wrong here. I do think the costume was well-done, and the plot was unique and seemed interesting at first. *MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*

Aside from the monster, no one in this movie has a name- it's just ""the girl,"" ""her boyfriend,"" ""his sister,"" and ""her girlfriend."" The lack of names didn't bother me while watching the movie, but it makes it harder to write a coherent review.

The biggest problem with this movie was the unlikable characters. It's obvious that the writers wanted us to feel sympathy for Spike (the monster), but I found it impossible to do so. The fact that he can quote corny prose from books does NOT soften the fact that he gravely injures and eventually murders the girl's boyfriend, kidnaps the girl, and attempts to force her against her will to live in the woods with him eating bugs. For those viewers who said they could relate to Spike and feel empathy for him, please get help before you hurt the person I assume you're stalking.

The lesbian couple was composed of a couple of idiots. The sister's girlfriend is apparently supposed to come off as knowledgeable and resourceful, yet she's the one who wants to go tromping off into the woods unarmed in the middle of the night chasing after a monster, instead of going to the cops and finding help as the sister wants to do. In order to prevent her girlfriend from running off into the woods, the sister hits her in the head and knocks her unconscious, an injury which eventually kills the girlfriend. These two really go beyond normal levels of horror movie stupidity.

Near the very beginning of the movie, the boyfriend has some weird sex dream about his own sister. This seemed to have nothing to do with anything in the rest of the movie, so I'm not sure why it was even included, but it made the boyfriend seem creepy and weird right from the get-go. The boyfriend then spends the rest of the movie lying around unable to speak until he is killed.

The lead girl was reasonably likable- she was only trying to save her boyfriend and herself- but I couldn't figure out why she talked the same way as Spike, with all the overblown, maudlin prose from classic literature. I can understand why Spike would talk that way- he's been isolated from all human contact for years and has only his books- but why would a modern young woman speak that way in normal conversation?

Overall, the characters were stupid and the movie as a whole seemed really try-too-hard and pretentious.",1314403200,6,2520,4.601336302895323
4155481,1,B003MQYK46,"What a waist of time and a really cool spike costume. Who is it that thinks  this is a good movie ? The only way you could write up a good review for this junk is if you worked on the movie, other wise I just call B.S. on any review higher then 2 stars. This is one of those ""Monster"" movies that is better left in the shadows and not in the light as you can plainly see this lame actor is wearing a costume with no make up. Why would you use a bright light in every other scene to light up every flaw in the costume and not use a little make up to blend it all in ? It really is worth seeing just so you can point and mock at the sad final cut. If your are not into seeing poor film making, bad acting and shoddy story telling stay away from this mess.",1294963200,2,753,3.7358490566037736
