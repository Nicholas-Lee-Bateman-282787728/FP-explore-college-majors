8530046,5,B008RDVL3M,"Excellent documentary about the junior black mafia from philadelphia bucky was a promising boxer but the streets also had a hold of him he was a family man world class athlete and street boss all in his late teens! his trade as drug kingpin is not to be glorified but if you have a heart you will be touched at his loss.  Filled with associates and family you will get an in depth look at the life of bucky, this is a must have for street doc fans.  If you liked the Karlton Hines story you will love this one too.",1356739200,2,514,4.079207920792079
