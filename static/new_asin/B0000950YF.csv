7989373,5,B0000950YF,Four great classics that will provide a gateway into the past to see; special effects evolution (as compared to today) and the style of acting and it's evolution (again as compared to today). Also it's great story telling and a great viewing experience. Highly recommended.,1375488000,,273,5.088888888888889
7989374,3,B0000950YF,"I purchased this collection from a department store I think or oldies.com one or the other. I have 3 of the 4 movies listed by everyone else. 1) The Night Evelyn Came Out Of The Grave, 2) Blood Tide, 3) Horror Express - The Enigma, the 4th movie is Called  SHIVER which is the same movie as Cataclysm. I believe BCI must have x this one from its sales because of maybe a copyright infringement, as the opening screen showing SHIVER seems to be dubbed into the film, only through searching out actors movies via IMDB did I find it to be Cataclysm. Still all movies are cheezey but good and worth the price then can be found for here on Amazon.",1361836800,,642,4.262295081967213

7989377,4,B0000950YF,"CONTENTS of TALES FROM THE BONEYARD 4 Movie Pack:

Lovely Grecian scenery is the highlight of BLOOD TIDE, the story of an oceanic monster that terrorizes a small village, and the sea diving archaeologist who tries to stop it. Good cast, bad script.

HORROR EXPRESS is the best film here, thanks to Peter Cushing and Chris Lee. In this one, a thawed-out ancient man-beast reanimates and wreaks havoc on the train carrying him from Manchuria to Shanghai.

Take one ex-mental patient, a creepy castle and add Erika Blanc and what have you got? Answer: THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE. A man has a breakdown after his wife's death and is hospitalized. Upon his release, the tortured fellow seeks out women who look like his beloved Evelyn. Has a violent surprise ending.

In PSYCHOMANIA, a motorcycle gang terrorizes a small town. After Satan promises them eternal life if they commit suicide, they do so one after the other, but things don't work out as planned. British-made fright flick has long-time actor George Sanders in a bit part-- one of his last screen appearances. Best thing about this one is the gang members' names: Hatchet, Chopped Meat, Gash etc.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PRAY-FOR-DEATH/dp/B00007G1UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PRAY FOR DEATH</a>&nbsp;is another frightfully good BRENTWOOD 4 movie pack.

7989379,4,B0000950YF,"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave- interesting little film about a man obsessed with red headed women who remind him of his ex.  Watchable not bad at all.

Psychomania- The weakest on the set.  About a motorcycle gang who makes a pact with the devil in order to gain immortality.

Blood Tide-This is a pretty good film reminds me of a movie called Dagon (spelling) a HP Lovecraft story and a strange and creepy movie in its own right.  Anyway Blood Tide has three pretty well known stars:  James Earl Jones, Deborah Shelton from Ciruitry Man II, and Legendary Jose Ferrer.  Jones is great and so is Sheldon and Ferrer.  Filmed in the Greek Islands this movie takes place on a small Greek Island where a Young man and his wife go there to find the man's sister Deborah Sheldon an artist who dissapeared.  He finds her there with James Earl Jones and his Barbie Doll airhead girlfriend.  But Sheldon is acting strange and the natives of the island have even more odd behavior.  Jose Ferrer is the Mayor of the Island.  Good film.

Horror Express aka The Enigma-Wow this is a good film.  It has to ledgends Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.  The movie takes place on a train in the late 1800s or early 0900s with a mysterious creature that is killing peole in a very interesting way.",1136678400,4,1286,4.482758620689655
