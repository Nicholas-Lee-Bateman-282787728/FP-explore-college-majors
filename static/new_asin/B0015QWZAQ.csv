3146827,5,B0015QWZAQ,"I loved this series, I keep hoping for a re-run on TV but it would be wonderful to have my own copy and I have no idea why it's not available because it's one that I would definitely buy and watch and watch again.
Sometimes executives make bad decisions and this was one of them, especially when I consider the garbage that IS released that no one buys that ends up in the dollar store.
This is a tough world and we need to grab our joy where we can, ridiculous that because of some executive (looking at YOU, Ken Ross) we cannot in this case.",1321574400,6,543,4.132075471698113

  ""I am deeply disappointed and upset to have to report that for reasons not quite clear to me CBS-Paramount TV has decided not to release ""Brooklyn Bridge"" on DVD. The executive who made this decision is Ken Ross in New York.  Perhaps he can explain it to you better than he did to me.  I'm very, very sorry. But, I have absolutely no control over this.  And, obviously this is very frustrating and painful to me.
Thank you for your interest and support.""

3146832,5,B0015QWZAQ,"This series would be hard to top in any future TV endeavor.
Heartwarming, funny, touching, realistic, how many words can I use to describe it.
When my family sat down for the first episode, 15 minutes into it, I knew it was a great show, and knowing how intelligent network execs are,  probably wouldn't last for more than one season. Season two was gravy.
I can hardly wait for this to come out. I have already written to Gary David Goldberg through his website and he seems confident that it will be coming out in May.
We all sure hope so, my two kids, adults now, are also anxiously waiting to buy it.",1270252800,12,604,4.345132743362832
3146833,5,B0015QWZAQ,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this series was superb and was never given a real chance.  I was lucky enough to find a DVD set of the whole series from some obscure seller but otherwise it seems to have been sentenced to oblivion, and I cannot for the life of me understand why.

The story of a Jewish family (3 generations) living in the same apartment building in Brooklyn during the 1950's or 60's, it is a wonderful microcosm of the melting pot that was America then, told with affection, understanding and laugh-out-loud humor.  Marian Ross plays the Jewish grandmother in what should be an Emmy award winning performance and everyone in it is spot on  perfect in their roles.  One of the episodes, which should be a classic in the annals of TV, involves a dinner at the local Chinese restaurant arranged by the 14-year old son of the Jewish family and the 14-year old daughter of an Irish Catholic family down the block.  The Jewish grandma and the Irish father (a cop, naturally) oppose the involvment of the kids because of their different religions but the kids think a dinner together might soften attitudes.  The resultant encounter, set to music from the gang rumble in West Side Story, is one of the funniest and most delightful things I've ever seen on TV, or anywhere else, for that matter.

Gary David Goldberg really outdid himself with this series and it should be brought back to show us what a series with real humanity, perception, and thought-provoking storylines looks like.  It's also a wonderful piece of Americana, something that's all too rare in this day and age of increased confrontation and divisiveness.",1268438400,55,1644,4.76056338028169

8259455,5,B0015QWZAQ,"When reading Marion Ross' memoir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Days-Happy-and-Otherwise/dp/1496715152/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Days: Happy and Otherwise</a>, I was reminded of this television series, and how I never forgot it.  (No, her book talks little of the series.)  I even taped episodes on VHS tapes, and recently came across them.  As Sophie Berger, Ms. Ross was the heart and soul of the show.  All the other regulars were terrific, too.  Episodes such as ""War Of The Worlds"" and ""The Last Immigrant"" were so exceptional, it makes you want to cry when you remember how stupidly soon the series was cancelled.

There's only one other series I feel that way about and that's ""Frank's Place"" (1987-1988).  That's another show not on DVD yet, and I wonder if it's for the same reason both series haven't been released.  It's known that ""Frank's Place"" is held up because of the song rights.  Just like ""Brooklyn Bridge"", they used original versions of the songs on the show.  Whatever the reason, it's sad such a wonderful series is not on DVD.  And it's sad all the Sophie and Jules Bergers are now gone . . . .

It was on only 2 seasons, 91-93, but make an impact.  You can find about half the episodes on youtube, but its not the same.  This was a cute and heartwarming TV show about a Jewish family in the mid-fifties.  Fabulous cast, great story lines.",1463011200,6,398,4.324324324324325

8259458,5,B0015QWZAQ,"This show was just amazing with great lines like ""No eating on the outside"" and ""It's not illegal and no one gets hurt and yet nuns might not like it"". Hugely sentimental and dripping with atmosphere, Brooklyn Bridge should be remembered as one of the finest examples of Americana ever made.

There is a photograph of a man holding a newborn baby while standing next to his wife in the opening credits. This same photograph also appears in the opening credits of the TV show Mad Men. Mysterious.

It should be available for purchase in digital download.",1399420800,2,553,4.690721649484536

The show was absolutely fantastic in every way (the writing and the cast).  When the network originally broadcast this great show, they kept moving it around so you could never find it....which is the way they get rid of a QUALITY show.

The concept of the extended family, values, love and the importance of a grandmother. They brought their experiences from the OldWorld and all that it entailed.
