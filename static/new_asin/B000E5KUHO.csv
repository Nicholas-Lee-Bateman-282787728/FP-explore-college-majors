2492121,5,B000E5KUHO,"A mesmerising lead performance and gorgeously effective cinematography makes this an excellent debut by Romanian filmmaker Ruxandra Zenide. Treated like a boy by her often drunk father who wishes she was one, Ryna is a top mechanic, helping him in the trade in their small village on the Danube Delta. Despite her baggy overalls and cropped hair, Ryna's feminine beauty doesn't go unnoticed - the postman, a French anthropologist and the corrupt mayor are all admirers - but when she disobeys her father and goes to the fair in a dress, Ryna pays a heavy and terrible price for pursuing her identity.",1196208000,18,600,4.892156862745098

2492163,1,B000E5KUHO,"I was so sorry for this girl. A psychopath for a father, and a weakling for a mother. What a terrible existence! What kind of a mother runs off leaving her child (especially a daughter) behind? What did she think would happen to the child? Mothers like these make me so upset. The father is a demon from hell! I cant believe that he sold his own daughter! What the hell! I would kill his ass before I left to go live with my mom. Lord have mercy! smh",1413244800,2,450,4.067415730337078

2492165,4,B000E5KUHO,"Ryna, an only child, lives with her parents and grandfather. Her father insists that she maintain a boyish appearance, apparently out of disappointment that she is not the son he wanted. She helps as a mechanic at the family's service station, which is under threat by development elsewhere and an underhanded mayor of the small village where they live.

At sixteen, Ryna is trying to find herself, to pull away from the domineering father and live her own life. She takes photos when she can get away from her work, longs to go to the local fair, and secretly explores the world of feminine fashion, piercing her own ears and trying on dresses offered by the doctor's wife.

As a young woman, she is not without her admirers, including the mayor's unwanted attention. This eventually comes to a head when her drunk father puts his own business interests ahead of his daughter's safety.

This is a well-written, well-acted, well-photographed film. The subtitles -- the dialogue is mostly Romanian, with some French, depending on who is actually speaking -- are mostly pretty good; there are a few places where they are absent, apparently because there is just too much conversation going on, and a few places where they are displayed for just one or two frames, too short to read.

It portrays life in a rural, relatively undeveloped village. It's a reminder to those of us in modern society that not everyone has benefited from the advancements of technology and conveniences. At the same time, it's interesting to see how so little of the story really relies on that context; Ryna's experience could happen just as easily in the big city. In that sense, we see Ryna coming to terms with her approaching adulthood not just in a personal way, but also as she finds her way from the somewhat primitive lifestyle in her family home, to the rest of the world.",1412380800,,1856,4.7725856697819315

2492170,4,B000E5KUHO,"""Ryna"" (2005 release from Romania; 94 min.) brings the story of Ryna (played by newcomer Dorotheea Petre), a 16 yr. old girl who lives in an isolated area in rural Romania. Her dad, for reasons never explained, treats her as a boy, and requires that she stays boy-ish in her appearance (short hair, no skirts, etc.). Despite  dad's restrictions, beautiful Ryna attracts plenty of attention from the local boys and men, all the way to the mayor of the village. Dad's business, a gas station and garage, is barely surviving (and does so by cutting corners every which way). One day dad gets the news that the village is refusing to renews his business license due to its out-of-the-way location, which would effectively put him out of business. Meanwhile, a French doctor has arrived in the village to conduct some EU-funded research. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is one tough father-daughter relationship drama. It breaks the heart to see the father (mis)treat his own daughter, without any love or apparent remorse or guilt. In that sense, kudos to Valentin Popescu in the thankless role of playing the dad. As you see him perform, it is hard to distinguish the unlikeable character from the brilliant performer. But the movie is carried on the shoulders of Dorotheea Petre, who absolutely will blow you away in the movie's title role. This was her very first starring role and I can't wait to see what other movies sh'e been in. Lastly, the movie does a great job in bringing us a sense of the isolation that exists still in many country-side communities in Eastern Europe. Lost of poverty, corruption and all-around tough environments to live in. This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. But if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Ryna"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1360454400,9,1964,4.790560471976401

8105923,4,B000E5KUHO,"Young Ryna is, in my opinion, a metaphor for the young democracy in post-communist Romania.

The reason I'm saying this is based on the following:
- The action takes place in a remote forgotten town in a far-est corner of Romania. Similarly, Romania was/is, from a western point of view, a little known country in the eastern corner of Europe
- At the micro level, Biris family is struggling to make their incipient free-enterprise business work, while at the macro level Romania was going through similar pains in the new free-market economy.
- The old generation, still indoctrinated by communism, opposing to the new, is represented by the strict father, who wants her daughter to be something else than what she actually is, constantly blocking her dreams, aspirations and initiatives.
- the initial foreign investments in Romania are represented by the innocent flirtation between the Frenchman and young Ryna.
- but foreign companies were seen with suspicion and often greeted by old school mobs with slogans like ""We are not selling off our country"", while being blamed and accused of vicious interests. Similarly, the Frenchman is the first suspect in the rape of young Ryna.
- the real rapists of the young Romania were in fact the same old communist leaders, represented here by the mayor of the forgotten town, the real rapist of the young and naive Ryna.

It is sad to see how hope and dreams are so abruptly and viciously terminated. Both at the micro and macro level.
It is sad to see how the rape is accepted and goes unpunished. Both at the micro and macro level.",1502323200,3,1579,4.822878228782288
