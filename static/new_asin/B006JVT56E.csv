8499834,5,B006JVT56E,Star Driver was a fun ride! I'm super glad I was able to watch this whole series.,1408233600,,81,3.823529411764706
8499835,5,B006JVT56E,"The series is appreciated for more of its efforts to be unique, not much of any thing else. The animation is top Japanese effort and the story ties itself into older staples of the past ('70s) w/ a modern twist. But much like the Complete abandonment of many other Japanese companies back in the '06 Bandai entertainment finally saw the writings on the wall and closed shop too. And if no ones noticed my older reviews in regards to Anime, please give them a gander. I bought this as a collector of dead memories of by gone days that are still celebrated like it's still 1999~~~~~ yah.....
Recommended for individuals of similar morbid tastes",1373932800,,642,4.640350877192983
8499836,5,B006JVT56E,"I hadn't previously seen Star Driver and this was a gift for my boyfriend, however after watching it I found myself curious to finish and find out what happens. I'll admit I was skeptical after seeing the Mech fight scenes since the main character's mech has high heels but I enjoyed it and so did my boyfriend. The package came pretty quickly and for the price I'm very happy.",1370822400,,377,4.478260869565218
