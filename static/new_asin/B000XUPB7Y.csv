3008927,4,B000XUPB7Y,"This is a masterful production of an incredibly dark and dissonant 'opera.'  I put the quotes around opera because this is not your typical opera by any stretch of the imagination.  The sets are purposefully minimal, the casting is purposefully odd, the orchestration is purposefully dissonant, the music and tone are purposefully haunting and the singing is incredible!

No one would believe that Jenny could fall for Jimmy.  No one would believe that anyone would want to live in Mahagonny.  No one would believe that anyone would have such disloyal friends as Jimmy after being together for so many years.  But believable or not, it works.  However, this is not your father's Rigoletto!  If you are considering this item because you like opera you may not be pleased with your purchase.  As already mentioned by another reviewer, the 20 minute conversation with the conductor on the DVD is invaluable.  He clearly explains that the geniuses behind this masterpiece didn't write an `opera' that they intended for the audience to experience with their hearts.  They wrote a biting commentary on the ills of society and the banality of human existence that they wanted us to experience from a distance with our heads.

It is dark, dissonant, minimalist and not at all uplifting, but it is masterful musical theater and the lead performers are all at the peak of their game and perfectly fit their various roles in this disharmonious stab at human existence and society's ill placed priorities.

I was blown away by this production and would have awarded it five stars but for the lack of libretto in the liner notes and/or English subtitles on the DVD.",1199750400,10,1652,4.92057761732852
3008928,3,B000XUPB7Y,"This 2007 LA Opera production of Kurt Weill and Bertold Brecht's 1931 Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny gets a fine musical performance (led by James Conlon), but the stage production falls short and is often frustratingly stagnant. Many numbers are given with the performers seated on stage (a particular peeve of mine I'll admit) or standing in a line across the stage facing the audience, often without interaction between the characters. In one scene two characters reminisce about their friendship. The music suggests intimacy yet the singers not only don't address each other but are also many feet apart on stage with the chorus standing between them.

In a work that straddles the worlds of opera and musical theater, it's not surprising that the strongest and most fully rounded performances come from the two Broadway stars in the cast. Audra McDonald in particular throws herself into the part of Jenny, the leader of Mahagonny's prostitutes, giving a provocative performance that a star of her stature could easily have avoided. Her singing, which I've often found too overpowering for her material, here fits nicely. Patti LuPone also does well as Leocadia Begbick, one of the band of fugitives who found the city providing recreation and entertainment for gold miners out in the middle of nowhere  (""It's easier getting gold out of men then out of rivers"" she says). Overall the rest of the cast sings well, but delivers spoken dialogue stiffly.

As I've said, the musical performance is first rate. Weill's score lies somewhere between Stravinsky and Gershwin, always tuneful, yet rhythmically active and harmonically pungent. Conlon delivers this in the present tense, without making it sound like a retro-recreation of Weimar Republic era sounds. My only criticism is that the chorus is sometimes unintelligible which, combined with the lack of English subtitles, can make the plot a bit hard to follow at times. Otherwise, considering the short supply of available recordings of this work (especially in English) I would recommend it to listen to with the video turned off.",1199577600,16,2096,5.12280701754386
3008929,3,B000XUPB7Y,"I've long been a fan of the Kurt Weill-Bertolt Brecht opera ""Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny."" In particular, I love the mid-1950s recording featuring Weill's wife Lotte Lenya in the lead role of Jenny. And I've always felt that this musical opus--a radical conjunction of opera, jazz, musical theater and political agit-prop--is best served by actors who sing rather than singers who act. Lenya's unorthodox vocals, simultaneously harsh and tender, fits this work to a T, especially since the musical numbers are closer to popular song than traditional operatic arias. Like Weill and Brecht's ""Threepenny Opera,"" ""Mahagonny"" is a fierce critique of capitalism conveyed in irresistible, jazzy melodies. It was with some trepidation, therefore, that I approached this DVD of a live 2007 performance of ""Mahagonny"" by the Los Angeles Opera starring noted singers Patti Lupone and Audra McDonald. This new production follows the storyline closely, but adopts a chronological progression that brings the action into the present in an attempt to make the work more relevant and accessible to modern audiences. I found this a little jarring at first, then decided it simply provided another level of aesthetic disconnection that's perfectly in tune with Brecht's famous alienation effect (i.e., self-consciously stressing the formal artificiality of a work so that audiences can engage more directly with its content). The staging, costumes and sets are impressive, and the performances suitably stylized and impassioned. Lupone is excellent as the amoral brothel owner whose vision of greed inspires the rise of the city of Mahagonny. As the prostitute Jenny, McDonald adroitly blends eroticism, tenderness and mercenary self-interest. The male performers are less vibrant, with the exception of Anthony Dean Griffey as Jimmy, the opera's sacrificial lamb who pays the ultimate price for having committed the ultimate crime: poverty. The musical arrangements of Weill's tunes are perhaps the production's weakest element, lacking the brio and emotional shading necessary to make the numbers truly come alive. And having the songs sung in English, while understandable, lessens the sardonic character of the German version. These criticisms aside, the performance captured on this DVD is an ambitious and welcome variation of this timeworn classic, one whose many positives make up for its few imperfections.",1199232000,7,2409,5.513513513513513
3008930,3,B000XUPB7Y,"This was a pleasant enough production but what was the point of a ""new"" English translation? There already is a fine English version of this opera, as performed by NY's Metropolitan Opera. This translation is just foolish. The definition of Mahagonny, meaning City of Nets, is changed to City of Webs. OK, but the lead male character is named Jimmy Mahoney and this version calls him Jimmy McIntyre! That's like coming out with a new translation of ""Carmen"" and deciding the character is now named ""Matilda.""",1198454400,10,508,4.9186046511627906
3008931,5,B000XUPB7Y,"The LA Opera production of ""Mahagony"" is nothing less than thrilling. Weill's great score is rendered powerfully and idiomatically and the cast is excellent, especially Audra McDonald, Patti Lupone and Anthony Griffey as Jimmy. The production was faithful to Brecht's epic theater principles, including the presentational style of acting. This is not realism, so it shouldn't be judged as if it were. And though the tone is ironic and satiric, that doesn't mean there isn't emotion or excitement. The ""agitprop"" works beautifully, with some contemporary flourishes (allusions to Iraq, for example) that are faithful to the Brechtian spirit.",1197936000,11,640,5.540816326530612
3008932,3,B000XUPB7Y,"I didn't much like the opera, The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, several decades ago at the Met, in an otherwise admirable production starring, as I recall, Julia Migenes, Richard Cassilly and Astrid Varnay. And I didn't much like the opera this time around either. That's partly because the opera is clunky in both plot and construction, as well as having such a 1930s agitprop sensibility as to make it more laughable than gripping and more importantly the DVD lacks English subtitles. Yes, I know, the production is IN English, but as in much opera in English, diction leaves much to be desired and one simply cannot make out a significant proportion of the words. Interestingly, when the DVD was shown on PBS they had the good sense to supply English subtitles if one chose to select them. But they're not there on the DVD and potential purchasers need to know that.

Performances? Yes, McDonald, Lupone and Griffey are excellent, as is the direction of Jimmy Conlon. Still, it was not, for me, an enjoyable experience, certainly nowhere near Weill's and Brecht's Threepenny Opera.

3008933,5,B000XUPB7Y,"Mahagonny is more-or-less an opera - Weill intended it as such, but with the cabaret-style numbers it can also be seen as musical theater. To modern viewers (well, me, at any rate) its construction initially seems unsatisfactory: the first half-hour is very bitty, more a series of tableaux than anything, and scenes are announced over a loudspeaker (every time we cut to it, I expected it to go ""The white zone is for loading and unloading only...""). This is all very distancing for the viewer, but that's the whole point - as James Conlon explains in the useful 20-minute interview, we are expected to be intellectually but not emotionally engaged. In fact, though, with a performance as good as Anthony Dean Griffey's as the unfortunate Jimmy and with the orchestra on top form, it's hard not to get caught up as the story unfolds, and Weill knew exactly what he was doing - musically, it all comes together superbly. The plot? Mahagonny is founded as a haven of ""contentment"" for men, but rules of good behavior bring boredom and, in the face of destruction from a hurricane, the rule is changed to ""everything is permitted"" (accompanied in this production by explicit reference to Nazi Germany). Mahagonny prospers, but Jimmy McIntyre commits the ultimate crime of not being able to pay; the end is remarkably bleak in its view of society: ""there's nothing you can do for a dead man"". The production is well designed, and clever in its gradual transformation to modern times, reminding us that although Brecht's particular form of anti-capitalist art may seem a little old-fashioned it still is of relevance. Of course if you're coming to this DVD as a lover of musicals rather than opera, the big draws will be Patti LuPone and Audra McDonald; both are excellent - in as much as you can get to the heart of a character who might not have one, McDonald manages it.",1197763200,28,1869,4.771604938271605

8229922,5,B000XUPB7Y,"My enjoyment of Weill's operas baffles me: they would seem to be everything I dislike about ""modern"" opera, and they present as dark and pessimistic a picture of humankind as Jonathan Swift himself ever produced; and yet I quite thoroughly enjoy them. I think I like Mahagonny a little less than Threepenny Opera; but it remains powerful; and over and over this production brought laughter to my lips simply because Brecht struck so close to the cynic in myself.
Every DVD I've gotten so far of a San Francisco Opera production has proved admirable -- a gem in my growing collection -- and this is right up there with the best of them.
It has subtitles in three languages, but none of them are English. This disappointed me, because I find that even when sung in my native language, vocal music can be difficult to understand. With no English subtitles available, I tried putting on the French; and it was an experience to make me wonder what beauties of an Italian, German, etc. opera we are missing when forced to follow it in translation -- though I still insist subtitles are better than nothing, because if I don't know at all what's going on, I might recognize that emotion is going on, but it remains impossible for me to identify which emotion or feel it. Fortunately, enough of the words in this DVD come through recognizably to follow both the story and the satire.",1506384000,,1375,4.639344262295082

8229926,4,B000XUPB7Y,"Mahagonny has a wonderfully melodic score that shows the influence of many popular genres of the period such as jazz and cabaret music, yet it is a very bleak work. It is a complex, very dramatic work, at times intensely moving. It has some intensely dramatic parts to it. Brecht's text is heavily ideological and full of intense unrelenting sardonic humour. The work is challenging for performers and audiance but there is so much to it that any fairly good production will have a considerable amount of interest to it. Despite what some critics think, the work has been performed with considerable impact in many places. The production on this DVD is successful in getting the work over to the audiance. Conlon's vigorous and insightful conducting works well. He treats much of the work as a musical; he is also good at conducting the grittier and more dramatic parts of the score. There is an immediacy to the production. This is achieved through good musical direction, as above, by uncluttered staging, clear spoken dialogue and clear announcements by tannoy. Some of the singing could be better but throughout most of the work it serves its purpose well enough, however there are some places where poor diction especially from the chorus and geeral incompatability with the score from Patti LuPone really let the side down. Contrast this with the excellent Audra McDonald who gives an outstanding performance. Another fault of the DVD is the lack of English subtitles. Brecht's text of significance in terms of literature. In failing to provide English subtitles, some of the text just doesn't come across at all. The recent relay of the Royal Opera House production had very clear subtitles that conveyed just how biting and ideological Brecht can be. However it is not the disaster it might sound to be. The spoken dialogue is very audable as is much of the sung text. The frequent tannoy announcements are helpful in conveying the story. If one can understand German, French or Italian there are subtitles in those languages. Yet overall this production works well. The best production by far that I have watched in English is the one from the Met conducted by James Levine from the Met, at B0064SHXE8. It is really worth finding. The best production in German is likely to be as fine as that by the Komische Oper, Berlin, from the GDR period, conducted by Robert Hannell with Maria Zahlten-Hall as Widow Bedbick, Elliott Palay as Jimmy (Paul Ackermann) and Tamara Lund as Jenny Hill, available to view online.",1428796800,,2519,4.901639344262295

8229930,3,B000XUPB7Y,"The most astonishing part of this DVD is that although it has Spanish, French and German subtitles, it does not have English ones.  This made it incredibly frustrating, as with singing the text is not easily understood, and it helped a lot that I've seen a performance of the same couple of years ago in Boston, so I knew the words somewhat.
It is truly unpleasantly surprising that the producers of this DVD missed this essential part - because Brecht's text is full of scathing satire, and each word must be understood.

However, this forces the listener to focus on the music more, and one realizes how poor it is - yes, it has some appellation to Stravinsky, but cannot approach such level even remotely.  It is the combination of the text and the music, the most savage story that makes The Rise and Fall a true immortal hit - eternal themes of seven deadly sins, betrayal and loneliness of man in the world.

The production itself is quite good, and the singing of Audra - Jenny is of too excellent a quality - she sings more as an opera diva, while her role is of a harlot.  Somehow her voice does not convey her character - it is too classical.

Jimmy is too old or too obese for the role - alas, after seeing a more vivacious and sharp production in Boston, it was difficult not to compare.  In fact, this Jimmy is in such a shape that one wonders if he is interested in women at all, undermining the credibility of his character, who frequents the brothel.

To me, the appeal of The Rise and Fall is much more the drama again, with the music taking the back seat. No wonder that Weill and Brecht quarreled during the creation of it and hardly finished it at all.

It is unfortunate that only this interpretation of the opera exists in DVD today. Because of its singularity, it is worth seeing, but I personally saw a better one and I am sure better productions exist.",1258761600,3,1877,4.417391304347826

It takes a bit of listening for the ear to accommodate the sound of Weill ... especially with the agendized text of Brecht ...  but once the words no longer become an issue one can hear and appreciate the unusual talent of Weill.  This is a GREAT production ... capturing the 'essence' of the creators while not fawning into a love match with Weill, the agenda or the time of German Expressionism.  I caution all NOT to write any comments until you have gone through multiple hearings .. and then I believe you will have nothing but praise for the opera and this performance.",1217808000,3,737,4.477611940298507
