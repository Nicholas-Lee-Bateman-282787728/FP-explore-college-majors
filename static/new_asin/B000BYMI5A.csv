2447146,3,B000BYMI5A,"I have not made up my mind about buying this set.  I was so excited a while back when TAGS finally made it to DVD season by season.  But like many other major fans of the show, I have been so disappointed with Paramount's offerings.  One the one hand, I am grateful to have my favorite TV show on DVD season by season.  On the other, I do not want to through my money away on these less than complete versions, only to get hit with the price of buying the ""remastered uncut versions"" somewhere down the road.  Why can't they just get it right the first time?

I will probably go on and buy this 5th season (one of TAGS finest).  I will be the shmuck, because I love the show.",1138838400,7,675,4.068181818181818
2447147,5,B000BYMI5A,"Season five of The Andy Griffith Show goes to both extremes for me.  On the one hand, it includes two of my least favorite episodes (""Aunt Bee's Romance"" and ""Family Visit""); but, on the other hand, it has my all-time favorite TAGS episode ""The Case of the Punch in the Nose"" and one of my top ten ""Man in the Middle.""  Season 5 was the final black & white episode and last season with Barney Fife as a regular character. Many fans probably stop watching TAGS after this season which is unfortunate because the color seasons are very underrated.  Luckily, Season Six is going to be released on DVD May 9, so definitely check it out!  Now, on to season five:

""Opie Loves Helen"":  Every season opened with an episode featuring Opie.  In this one, Opie develops a crush on Miss Crump.

""Barney's Physical"":  It's Barney's fifth anniversary on Andy's force and it may be his last year as he is an inch and a few pounds away from passing the new physical requirements for lawmen.  Trivia:  When producer Aaron Ruben left the show this season, he was given a plaque with a 5 on it just like the folks had engraved on Barney's watch.

""Family Visit"":  Barney doesn't appear in this episode.  Unfortunately, Aunt Bee's sister, brother-in-law, and nephews do, and they are annoying as all git-out.

""The Education of Ernest T Bass"": Ernest T. Bass wants to impress his sweet Romeena by getting an education so he ends up in Helen Crump's class and begins to regard her as a mother figure.

""Aunt Bee's Romance"":  An old boyfriend of Aunt Bee's arrive and he is even more annoying than her relatives in ""Family Visit.""  He's a person who is always cracking bad jokes and is never serious.  Fortunately, Andy recognizes his bad intentions.  This episode includes the famous Calvin Coolidge/Mark Twain/the weather scene between Andy and Floyd.

""Barney's Bloodhound"":  Barney tries to train a dog named Blue in tracking down an escaped criminal.  Trivia:  Howard Morris (Ernest T Bass) is the voice of the radio announcer and Leonard Blush.

""Man in the Middle"":  One of my all-time faves!  Barney is about to break up with Thelma Lou, Andy tries to help Barney by agreeing with him when he says maybe he and Thelma Lou weren't meant for each other, Barney blabs this to Thelma Lou when they patch things up, Thelma Lou gets mad at Andy and then gets mad at Helen when she says she's acting childish, Barney gets mad at Andy for taking Helen's side, Andy refers to Helen as a ""third party,"" Barney blabs this to Helen who gets mad at Andy for not referring to her by name (""My name is Helen Crump, C-R-U-M-P"")...Trust me, it's just funny!

""Barney's Uniform"":  Bully Fred Plummer tells Barney he's going to pop him one if he catches him out of uniform, so Barney is afraid to be seen in civvies. Luckily, Barney is taking karate lessons in Mt. Pilot with Mr. Izamoto.

""Opie's Forune"":  Opie discovers a wallet with fifty dollars in it.  After waiting a week, he believes the money is his.  Then Barney reads an announcement in Lost and Found about a missing wallet.  I don't care for this one because Andy automatically thinks the worst of Opie.

""Goodbye, Sheriff Taylor"":  Andy considers taking a job in Raleigh and leaves Barney in charge...bad move.  Trivia:  First time Goober wears that goofy beanie.

""The Pageant"": Aunt Bee wants the part of Lady Mayberry in the Centennial Pageant but Clara, like she is in most things, is the superior actress.  I like that part when Aunt Bee calls Chief Noogatuck, Nungatook.

""The Darling Baby"":  The Darlings return to town with Charlene's baby daughter Andelina hoping to get her hooked up to a future mate...Opie.

""Andy and Helen Have Their Day"":  Barney wants to give Andy and Helen the gift of Saturday where they can relax at Myer's Lake and he will run all their errands.  Of course, he keeps interrupting them with trivial matters and then believes they are engaged.  Howard Morris appears as the TV repairman.

""Three Wishes for Opie"":  Barney buys a fortune-telling kit at an auction and thinks Count Istvan Teleky is granting them wishes.  Like in the previous episode, this ultimately results in Barney believing Andy and Helen are engaged.

""Otis Sues the County"":  Otis falls at the jail and a slick lawyer tries to make him believe that, by suing the county, he will be helping his friends Barney and Andy.

""Barney Fife, Realtor"":  Barney gets into a sideline realty business and tries to get everybody to sell their houses and move into other houses.

""Goober Takes a Car Apart"":  Goober is suppose to be in charge of the courthouse but speedster Gilly keeps hounding him to fix his car.  Caught between two responsibilities, Goober takes apart and rebuilds Gilly's car in the courthouse.

""The Rehabilitation of Otis"":  Barney tries to use psychology to help Otis get over his drinking problem.  He ends up arresting him out of ""tough love"" and Otis gets so mad he decides to give his business to another jail.  I like the scene where they take the Rorschach test and argue over whether the card is a bat or butterfly.

""Lucky Letter"":  Barney thinks he's doomed at the firing range because Andy convinced him not to send a chain letter.  Now Barney's not superstitious, he's just cautious.

""Goober and the Art of Love"":  Andy and Barney convince Goober to date Lydia Crosswaith who turns out to be a bore and sticks her head out of the car window like a dog.

""Barney Runs for Sheriff"":  When Andy's job in South America falls through, he runs for sheriff as a write-in.  Barney is supposed to run just a token campaign, but goes overboard.

""If I Had a Quarter Million"":  Barney stumbles upon a suitcase with $250,000 and tries to play it off as a newly rich to entice the crook out of hiding.

""TV or Not TV"":  Bogus television producers come to town pretending to be interested in creating a series based on the life of the sheriff without a gun.  Their main intentions have to do with the Mayberry bank.  Gavin McLeod appears.

""Guest in the House"":  A beautiful, young, female friend of the family stays with the Taylors and, of course, Helen goes off.

""The Case of the Punch in the Nose"":  Best TAGS episode ever!  Barney runs across a 19-year old assault case that was never properly closed and brings back all the hard feelings leading to a schism in the town and numerous nose punches.  The Bobby Gribble, Emma Larch scene is classic.

""Opie's Newspaper"":  Opie and Howie try to widen their scope by creating a column like ""Mayberry After Midnight.""

""Aunt Bee's Invisible Beau"":  Clara gets Aunt Bee thinking she's getting in the way of Andy and Helen's romance so she makes up that she's dating the butter-and-egg-man.  Barney puts a big crack in her plans when he finds out Aunt Bee's pretend beau is married.

""The Arrest of the Fun Girls"": Andy and Barney arrest the fun girls and try to hide their presence from Thelma Lou and Helen.

""The Luck of Newton Monroe"":  Don Rickles plays a traveling salesman who can't seem to get a break, well, save for the things that he breaks himself.

""Opie Flunks Arithmetic"":  Opie is having problems in arithmetic and, thanks to know-it-all Barney, Andy overreacts and makes things worse.

""Opie and the Carnival"":  Opie hopes to win his pa an electric razor at ashooting gallery but is cheated by crooked carnies.

""Banjo-Playing Deputy"":  Jerry Van Dyke is an unemployed carnival musician who happens to be related to a friend of Aunt Bee, so Bee convinces Andy to make the klutzy, stammering loser his deputy.  Luckily, that didn't last and we would get Warren Ferguson (sigh) in season 6.",1138838400,119,7601,4.674225245653817

2447149,5,B000BYMI5A,"I noticed that someone else referred to the laugh tract blunder in earlier seasons.  I thought it was just my set.  I haven't watched all the episodes.  I hope there's no other episodes with missing tracks.

I love the ""Count"" episode in season 5.  Another classic ""spooky"" episode is in an earlier season--the haunted house.  No matter how many times I see it, when Gomer tells Barney, ""I guess that makes you Sheriff now"" I hit the floor laughing.  Classic.

This is the greatest show ever, seasons 1 thru 5 anyway.  Don Knotts and Andy Griffith together were the best.  Barney Fife is no doubt the greatest fictional character ever created--with the possible exception being the character of Andy Taylor.  Barney hits us with the laughs, but Andy hits you in the heart.  He is the larger than life boss, Dad, neighbor, and friend that we all aspire to be.",1136592000,8,858,4.6466666666666665
2447150,5,B000BYMI5A,"I cannot wait for this release, and only hope that Paramonut has heard some of the criticism, particularly of Seasons 3 and 4, and will remedy the problems. Does anyone have a complete list of Season 5 episodes they could post on here? Some of my personal faves have already been mentioned, but I wanted to add two more great ones. There's the epsiode where Andy and Barney think Aunt Bee is having an illicit affair with the married butter-and-egg man. And then there's the episode where Opie develops a major crush on his teacher, Helen Crump, much to Andy's consternation. I'll never forget the look on Andy's face when he discovers Opie's gift to Miss Crump is a sexy pair of silk stockings!! Kind of risque subject matter there, but as always with TAGS, it's tastefully done and very funny.",1136160000,6,795,4.6453900709219855
2447151,5,B000BYMI5A,"Season five is truly the zenith for (my opinion) the best television show ever created.  Though I still admire, and enjoy many of the color episodes (usually when Goober or Howard are featured)of seasons six through eight, the void left by Don Knotts was an impossible one to fill.  The character of Barney Fife is (again, my opinion) simply the greatest fictional role ever written. Helen is featured more predominately this season as well, providing a romantic tension never before seen in the show.  As for the episodes contained in season five, here are my personal favorites:

'FAMILY VISIT' - Minus Barney, Andy's relatives drive him nuts.

""Why, I'm the man who taught the sheriff everything he knows,"" - Uncle Ollie.

'BARNEY'S PHYSICAL' - To remain 'Fearless Fife', Barney is forced to 'bulk and grow up'.  As is normally the case, good ol' Ange comes to the rescue with good, old-fashioned common sense.

""He is too.  He is too hanging himself,"" Opie.

'THE EDUCATION OF ERNEST T. BASS' - That country 'nut' is back in town, this time in quest of an education program that will produce a diploma in a matter of days, courtesy his 'mother figure', Helen Crump.

""You're not no-count...you're just...ignorant,"" Andy.

""Yore just bein' nice,"" Ernest T.

'ANDY AND HELEN HAVE THEIR DAY' - Feeling Andy and Helen's romantic interludes are lacking in quantity due to workload, good ol' Barn decides to 'give them a day' to themselves.  Think 'Tight-lips' Barn then proceeds to make a grade-A pest of himself? Correc-ta-mundo!

""I can't do William Holden...he talks like everybody else,"" Goober.

'OTIS SUES THE COUNTY' - Otis trips coming out of maximum security cell number two, and proceeds to sue for damages, egged on by a crooked lawyer.

""There's nothing more painful than a torn calcium,"" Barney (a little gassed)

'THREE WISHES FOR OPIE' - Barn evokes the magical powers of Count Iz Van Tileckie, with hilarious results.

""He sure is lively tonight,"" Goober.

'GOOBER AND THE ART OF LOVE' - Once Goober establishes himself as a romantic interloper, Andy and Barney take him under their wing to teach the art of romance.  First on the Goob 'Love Connection' wishlist: none other than that 'albatross' herself, Lidia Crosswathe.

""Goober, you were on a date..you weren't taking medicine,"" Barney.

'OPIES NEWSPAPER' - Opie and Howie start their own Mayberry 'gossip rag' when their school paper lags in sales, with Andy, Barney and Aunt Bee serving as their main 'sources' of material.

""Her Chicken a'la King tasted like Wallpaper paste,"" Aunt Bee.

Not a turkey episode in the lot, season five is the pinnacle of excellence for this one of a kind entertainment series.

We can only hope the 'laugh track' blunder of season four has been avoided.

NOTE: to the person who mentioned the 'spagetti episode'...this is also one of my favorite color shows.",1135814400,11,2862,4.945492662473795
2447152,5,B000BYMI5A,"I would also like to thank Paramount for finally bringing the Andy Griffith Show (seasons) to us on DVD. I have read many reviews and agree with most of them. Once Barney left the show there was a void that could never be filled by Warren (Barney's replacement), However seasons 6-8 I mostly can not wait for. There are so many great episodes in these seasons. I spent three years of my life recording these shows on late night TBS and other stations. I finally got all 249 episodes in that time and have waited YEARS for these DVD's. One of my all time favorites is ""Dinner at Eight"" where Goober messes up phone directions and causes Andy to have to eat 3 spaghetti dinners.(Goobers, Howards and Helens). Everytime I see it. I just have to have spaghetti. I can go on and on naming great episode after episode, but I will spare you all. So I say if you aren't a fan of the ""Color"" years...just give them a chance. You will be!",1135814400,9,928,4.339080459770115
2447153,4,B000BYMI5A,Season 5 was bittersweet to fans of the show. It would be Don Knotts last season(sadly he wasn't even in the last show aired this season and i've often wondered why)Also when Knotts left the show he took Betty Lynn(Thelma Lou) with him. Even though she wasn't a main character i always thought her and Knotts worked well together. At least they would be together in one more episode in season 6. It was also the last season we would see Otis(Hal Smith) more than once. He would only do two more episodes during the next two seasons. This season is still filled with plenty of laughs and i'll be first in line to get it the day it is released,1135555200,9,641,4.305785123966942

2447155,5,B000BYMI5A,"Thank you Paramount for continuing to release The Andy Griffith Show on DVD. This release of season five will conclude ""The Barney Years"", as Don Knotts as Deputy Barney Fife, left the series after season five as a regular cast member, in order to do films. I personally feel that these first five years were far-and-away the best the show had to offer. I know that many other people feel much the same way, too. I still plan to buy the final three seasons (six-eight), as-and-when they are released anyway just to make my collection complete, as Don Knotts also made several guest starring appearances on the show during the final three seasons as Barney Fife. There were also several other worthwhile episodes during seasons six-eight. Another thing that changed after season five was that the series was then filmed in color. Thank you again for making these DVD collections available and please continue to release the most complete and unedited episodes possible.",1131926400,53,968,4.9447852760736195

I never really cared for the series after Don Knotts.  The magic in the show seemed to be a chemistry between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts that is quite rare.  Watching these episodes brings much laughter - it is no wonder that Don Knotts won several Emmys during his time on the series.  But the episodes also bring several tender moments.

There are many life lessons taught through these episodes, including the ever present theme of ""believe in others.""  In a world of TV today that seeks to tear down, destroy, ridicule and rule over others, a show where the main character spends time defending and protecting his bumbling sidekick, sometimes laying his own reputation on the line, is amazing.  And when Andy saved Barney's bacon and solved the problem, Andy would almost always give the credit publicly to Barney.  Not sure you'd see that in too many sitcoms today.  You can watch this show and feel good when its done.

The lessons for raising children should not go unnoticed. In one episode Andy gets upset with Opie who gets very mad at others because Opie did not win a race and is a ""sore loser.""  Andy teaches Opie that it's not about losing, but how you react that is more important.  Contrast that to what we teach kids today - everyone is a winner, everyone gets a trophy - there are no winners.  In today's world of finding someone else to take the blame or helping others find a way not to take responsibility, this series stands in stark contrast.  It teaches us to own our mistakes and failings while understanding it's not the end of the world and moving forward with the support of others.

It's amazing how much my young grand daughter enjoys watching Andy Griffith.  She enjoys the sophisticated kids shows of today, but she will ask if she can watch Andy Griffith, and then sit entranced by the show.

The quality of these DVDs is great, especially considering the technology that was used to originally record them.",1479600000,,2090,4.617886178861789

2447271,2,B000BYMI5A,"The show really went downhill in season 5. The small-town Mayberry charm, witty story lines, and easy-going and simple country character attitudes that were in seasons 1-4 are long gone in season 5 due to the show's new writers, producers, and directors. Starting in season 5, Barney and Andy are always angry and yelling at each other or others in almost every season 5 episode. Plus the new lazy writers started recycling story lines (The Fun Girls, etc). It's really sad to see such a wonderful show go downhill so badly. Season 5 stories are basically uninspired and boring, based mostly Barney and Andy's angry character interactions. I suspect Andy Griffith and Don Knotts got quickly fed up with the show's new directors and writers ruining their characters. You can see it in their faces. Stick with seasons 1-4 and you'll be happier.",1472169600,7,842,4.895104895104895

Still crack up watching them even after all these years.
Won't get any of the color episodes, not just because Barney left, but even Andy was different. He seemed more irritable, not so much the laid back, easy going Sheriff we came to love.

show, and they were both good, and sad.
I live in NC, and have been to and through Siler
City, neighbor of the mythical Mayberry.
The Andy Griffith Show was light years ahead of
it's time, and set the standard for shows that followed.
Most all of us, wanted to live in a laid back town like
Mayberry, and even now we miss those simple times.
I will not get into the episodes of season 5, as most of
us already have watched and enjoyed them.
The sad thing that happened in this season, was that Don
Knots, left the show, as a full time cast member.
Though he did come back in a few future episodes, the show
was never quite the same again.
Years later, Mr Knots said, It had been a mistake to leave the
show when he did.
Sadly, we have lost both Andy Griffith and Don Knots, may they RIP.
But don't be too sad, as the streets in Heaven, are safer now, that Andy
and Barney are patrolling them.",1429315200,,938,4.103260869565218

2447541,4,B000BYMI5A,"Don Knots' absence from the season was obvious. While it remains my favorite show of all time, by season 5 the humor and natural interaction of the main characters was slipping. As hard as he may have tried, Goober was no Barney. The producer's efforts to replace one with the other just didn't work the same or as well.

As a side note am saddened to have discovered that Amazon Prime has removed ""The Andy Griffith Show"" from it free viewing list for Prime members. This decision has forced me to consider other streaming options.

11/2/14 Update:

I found Andy Griffith along with many other of my ""old time"" favorites not available free through Amazon Prime were available on NetFlix, commercial free and have since subscribed to their streaming service.

By season five, the Andy Griffith Show cast and crew had all the rough edges trimmed and polished. Opie (Ron Howard) was a seasoned actor but still a very convincing kid, Barney (Don Knotts) had every expression and move honed to precision, and of course Sheriff Taylor (Andy Griffith) was at the top of his bemused game.

2447565,3,B000BYMI5A,"I have all the discs from the Andy Griffith Show.  Enjoyed most of them quite a bit.  But there were a few things I didn't like.  First of all Aunt Bee got on my nerves.  Her high pitched voice and her  ""nothing is good enough for me attitude"" got on my nerves, and I often skipped segments she was in.  Finally, and biggest of all was Barney Fife.  I never thought he was the least bit funny, I thought he was stupid and a real smart ass.  I also thought that since Andy had given him a good job all along, he was always trying to act like he was the smartest and big wheel in the police Dept.  One line I remember well, was when Andy was invited to a party by a nice wealthy friend, Andy asked if he could bring Barney, and his friend said OK.  But Barney acted like a total jerk at the party to get attention and he was not invited to join the club.  When Andy refused to join because Barney was not invited to join, he told Barney who was very anxious to get in, that they only wanted ""one of us"".  Barney assumed they wanted him and not Andy, and Andy didn't tell him the real truth.  Barney howled that it was terrible that they didn't want Andy, so he wouldn't join either.  Andy didn't tell him the truth, which was it was Barney they didn't like and that truth be known, Barney acted like a real smart ass at the party, and that's why his friends didn't invite him.  Barney always thought he was the better of the two, though he was as pompous and stupid as an ass.",1404259200,,1474,4.051903114186851

Season 5 is missing Gomer whose spin-off USMC series was on the rise. But Goober, Gomer's cousin serves as a good replacement. Season 5 is also the last year with Don Knotts as the deputy.

It was just so convenient for me to lay in bed and watch one show after another without any commercial interruptions. Also being able to watch one program after another with a simple tap of my finger for the next episode was almost too much to ask for. I fell in love with the show, especially Andy, Opie, Aunt Bea, and Barney all over again.

(134) Man in the Middle
(135) Barney's Uniform
(142) Three Wishes for Opie
(147) Goober and the Art of Love
(155) The Arrest of the Fun Girls

The scripts are not as consistently strong as the previous couple of seasons.  There are more 'clinkers' in season 5 than the previous four seasons combined.

This was the last black and white season of TAGS and also Don Knotts's final season as a regular character.  As is generally acknowledged, the overall quality dropped off in the color seasons (6-8).

2447672,5,B000BYMI5A,"The sad passing of George Lindsey has led me to watch many episodes of Andy Griffith's fifth season, which was the first to feature Goober as a regular character.  With Jim Nabors leaving to start his own show, Gomer Pyle, USMC, someone had to take over the job at Wally's Filling Station.  After being introduced in the previous season's episode, The Fun Girls, Lindsey did a more-than-adequate job replacing Gomer in the mechanic role.  Season Five features some of Goober's best episodes, including Goober Takes a Car Apart, The Case of the Punch in the Nose, Goober and the Art of Love, Andy and Helen Have Their Day, and Three Wishes for Opie.  Whether he's the main focus or one of the supporting characters, Goober is a highlight throughout this season.  If you're looking for some great episodes of The Andy Griffith Show to celebrate the unforgettable career of one of TV's best, this is the season to go with.  Lindsey played one of the many characters that made The Andy Griffith Show one of the greatest of all time, and my longtime personal favorite TV comedy.

Unfortunately, Season Five is also the last to feature Barney as a regular character.  Even though Don Knotts would return for several guest roles in later seasons, he left to embark on a Hollywood career after this one.  It's regrettable, too, since the show really seemed to be hitting its stride.  But, after Knotts left, it became colorized and the quality of the writing declined, resulting in what most fans feel was a mediocre version of a once-great show.  It's good to know, however, that before that happened, George Lindsey helped make Season Five one of the show's best.  He was an incredibly funny actor, and will be missed by his many, many fans.",1336435200,,1735,4.7275747508305646

I love Mayberry and all it's colorful characters. I will never regret buying 1-5 and will probably by the rest because even though Barn leaves, he does visit, and what could be better than catching a glimpse of him?

2447680,5,B000BYMI5A,"TAGS season 5 may not be the end of its universe, but it is an end of an era as the series moves into the world of color without Don Knotts.  While Season 5 contains some episodes less than stellar, it does have classics.  While Gomer Pyle made his jump at the end of season four, Goober takes his place as a more prominent character while the series progresses.  Unfortunately, Barney Fife, makes a muted exit well before the end of the season.  TAGS - Five is a necessity completing a collection of a classic in a bygone era.  While the name endured, its mood, its charm ended here.

Opie Loves Helen: Opie pushes the boundaries of psychological and legal norms by courting Ms. Crump.

Barney's Physical: Andy defeats State law to rid of dangerous and unqualified law enforcement personnel.

The Family Visit: Physical abnormalities of church patrons inspires Aunt Bee to invite her relatives for a stay.

The Education of Ernest T. Bass: In 1964, adult criminals were allowed to share a classroom with innocent grade school children.

Aunt Bee's Romance: Aunt Bee has a history of men who make habit of telling insensitive jokes.

Barney's Bloodhound: Barney dreams he can train a dog to be a detective until the whistle is blown.

Man in the Middle: Twisted words pull relationships apart.

Barney's Uniform: Thin fabric keeps Barney's pride from getting a pummeling from an angry grocer.

Opie's Fortune: Opie learns first hand, ""easy come, easy go.""

Goodbye, Sheriff Taylor: Hello Goober's hat.

The Pageant: Aunt Bee versus Clara.

The Darling Baby: The Darlings descend from the hills for an arranged marriage.

Andy and Helen Have Their Day: Another time, Barney gets it all wrong.

Three Wishes For Opie: Supernatural powers grants Opie his wishes.  A most nontraditional TAGS episode.  One of my favs.

Otis Sues the County: Slip and fall scams reaches the Mayberry courthouse.

Barney Fife, Realtor: Barney begins his real estate empire.

Goober Takes a Car Apart: Andy aims a rifle at Goober's head.  But will he press the trigger?

The Rehabilitation of Otis: Mayberry loses a piece of its soul as Otis takes his business elsewhere.

Lucky Letter: Floyd enjoys his vengeance on Barney and watches him squirm.

Goober and the Art of Love: Goober and Lydia sitting in a tree, she's B-O-R-I-N-G.

Barney Runs for Sheriff: Barney manages to lose an election while his name is the only one on the ballot.

If I Had a Quarter Million: Barney has his opportunity to be a big shot.

TV or Not TV: Bank robbers use the guise of reality TV.  Barney will unwittingly help.

Guest in the House: An awkward, vulnerable woman gets under Helen's skin.

The Case of the Punch in the Nose: Barney's due diligence causes a wave of violence tearing the town apart over a shave 19 years ago.  One of the top 3!

Opie's Newspaper: Opie discovers the profit in gossip.  Andy rushes to shut down ""Mayberry after Midnight.""

Aunt Bee's Invisible Beau: Aunt Bee makes up a story that could destroy a marriage.

The Arrest of the Fun Girls: Bad enough to be arrested but not good enough to be seen.

The Luck of Newton Monroe: A traveling salesman brings shoddy merchandise and bad luck to Mayberry.

Opie Flunks Arithmetic: Barney's pride re-invents math before we say goodbye to him.

Opie and the Carnival: Carnies deceive both Opie and Goober.  Goober was easier.

Banjo-Playing Deputy: While the carnival remains in county limits, Andy drafts a deputy with a speech impediment.  Listen carefully and you'll notice the carnies from the previous episode are still in business.",1280361600,,3568,4.824793388429752

2447682,4,B000BYMI5A,"Most fans of the series will tell you this show started downhill in season 6 when the episodes went from black and white to color.  I would argue that the decline started in season five.  I think the main reason is the start of the spin-off series Gomer Pyle, USMC which is where a lot of behind the scenes people ended up.  I would guess that the producers felt that the Griffith show was established and could continue running with a change in some of the personnel.  There are still a lot of great episodes here, but ""Goober Takes A Car Apart"", ""Barney Fife, Realtor""  and a few other examples are evidence of what's to come.",1267401600,,628,4.379310344827586

My favorite episode is the one where Otis goes along with a shady lawyer and decides to sue the county for having fallen in front of his cell after one of his alchoholic binges. Floyd's performance steals the show. With Jim Nabors absence as Gomer Pyle, the producers apparently decided to feature more of Floyd and his hilarious mannerisms. George Lindsey has replaced Gomer as Goober. Not a great replacement, but Nabors was a tough act to follow.

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Barney Fife (played by Don Knotts) as Andy's cousin and the town's deputy sheriff. Thanks to Barney's false pride and need to appear all-knowing, Andy spends much of his time trying to straighten out various situations that might otherwise have never occurred. Still, it's apparent that Barney has a good heart, and his sense of humor more than make up for the trouble he often stirs up.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; rock-throwing hlllbilly Ernest T. Bass; Barney's ever-patient girlfriend, Thelma Lou; the goofy and childlike mechanic Goober; and Opie's teacher Helen Crump, who is also Andy's girlfriend.

My pet peeve with this season is the disappearance of Barney. Although Don Knotts chose not to renew his contract, there was no reason for the deputy to leave...and the writers gave none. One episode, Barney is alongside Andy, as he has been for years; the next, he is simply gone, with no explanation. In the next season, he returns as a guest star, and it is then said that Barney left town to take a better job. Still, it's almost an insult to faithful viewers; that explanation should've been given immediately!

If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for further seasons.",1165536000,3,2220,4.8753315649867375

2447703,5,B000BYMI5A,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers. The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie (Ron Howard), Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. And Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

The Andy Griffith Show (Season 5) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Opie Loves Helen"" in which Opie falls head over heals into puppy love with his teacher, Helen Crump, lavishly spending seventy-four cents on a gift for her... Other notable episodes include ""Otis Sues the County"" in which the appearance of an ambulance-chasing lawyer leads to trouble when he convinces Otis to sue the county for hazardous jail cell conditions, and ""Banjo-Playing Deputy"" in which Jerry Van Dyke makes a hilarious guest appearance as Jerry Miller, a carnival act who becomes Andy's deputy for a short time after losing his job...

2447705,3,B000BYMI5A,"This is one of my favorite comedy shows ever, and I've bought every DVD collection (I won't go past 5 into the post-Barney years; by the way, Rest in Peace, Don Knotts). However, I have done so begrudgingly, because despite the wealth of bonus features that Paramount has lying around, they refuse to put anything but the episodes on these discs. What makes the DVD format so great are extras. Think of all the things they could easily put on these sets

*Hundreds of production and publicity photos

*Original TV spots

*Emmy footage (Don Knotts won five, after all)

*Interviews, interviews, interviews. There have been countless numbers of behind-the-scenes specials on Griff's show. Just two years ago, a new one aired on CBS.

*Commentaries-If Paramount had taken a few moments to ask Don and Andy to come to the studio to talk about their show, that would probably give them a big boost in sales. Sadly, we will never hear Don Knotts do an audio commentary for the Andy Griffith Show. Truly a missed oppurtunity

*The wonderful 80's reunion movie. Hopefully, they will release this as an individual disc later on.

All-in-all, these official Andy Griffith releases are slapdash and dissapointing. You know something is wrong when the sets being released by minor, no-name studios have special features on them (quite a few of them have documentaries) and the real releases don't. You can do better, Paramount. I'll give you this--at least you're better than Universal.",1141516800,18,1474,4.967479674796748
2447706,5,B000BYMI5A,"This DVD presentation by Paramount Home Video is, like the previous four season sets, excellently packaged and produced.  Paramount has truly done a good job of archiving and presenting this classic TV show for our video libraries.  Just like the previous four, the picture quality is superb and the menus and navigation are easy and convenient.  The packaging and overall quality is very well done and makes this, and all of the other season sets, well worth the purchase price.  I am very pleased with my collection and have enjoyed going back and viewing the episodes uncut, with the complete epilogues at the end of each program, and in digitally enhanced picture quality.

I've watched TAGS on TV for decades and I never realized just how much the TV networks have chopped and diced these programs (usually by eliminating the epilogue) for their commercials until I got these DVDs.  Even after all these years I was suprised to see scenes from various episodes I had never seen before because they were cut to make time for more ads.  I'm not sure about missing laugh tracks or scene deletions as others have suggested in other reviews.  I haven't noticed anything missing from the episodes.

2447711,5,B000BYMI5A,"The fifth season of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" (1964-1965) is yet another admirable and very funny year in the eight-season lifespan of this beloved television comedy series. Season #5 is presented in its complete form on the five discs that make up this handsome DVD set from Paramount Home Entertainment. And each of these 32 episodes looks beautiful, too. Excellent video and audio quality.

All 32 show-closing epilogues are fully intact in this DVD collection (unlike Season 3, which has a select few missing). And as far as I can tell, short of digging up each original script (somehow) and checking all shows word for word, these episodes appear to be ""uncut"". I can't see any discernible edits, despite a disclaimer at Paramount's webpage for this release that says: ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"".

However, that same ""edits"" disclaimer is not included on the back of this Season-Five box (as it was on the S.3 box, which does contain a few edits). Perhaps Paramount was just putting a needless 'fear of God' into fans for no good reason. Beats me. But these shows look fine (and complete) to me.

The average run time per episode here is about 25:30, with the shortest running time being approximately 24:35. So, if there are any ""cuts"" to these episodes, it must not add up to very much total footage, that's for sure. There are very few eps. in this set that run under 25 full minutes.

Also on the subject of ""edits"" -- Each of these thirty-two shows does contain its original laugh track (unlike the Season-Four TAGS set, which has a few laugh tracks missing). I diligently checked each and every Season-Five program to see if the laughter is present on the soundtrack....and it is there for all episodes, which is as it should be. I like the shows better with the laughter in the background (canned or otherwise). ;)

Opening & Closing Credits ..... It appears to me that all of the originally-aired opening and closing titles (credits) are used for this Season-Five DVD set. Although it's obvious that the Main Title opening sequence was actually filmed years before this 1964-'65 season, because Opie's much-younger age in the credits is quite noticeable. A new show opening wasn't created between seasons 2 and 5, so the exact same one that was filmed in 1961 (prior to the start of the second season) was used for all of those years.

The original whistling theme music seems to be fully intact here, on both the opening and closing portions of each episode; and the CBS-TV ""Eye"" (logo) has been left intact on these Andy Griffith prints as well.

Despite the few edits and laugh-track omissions in previous releases, Paramount (in my opinion) has done themselves proud with ""The Andy Griffith Show"" on DVD. I know I shall enjoy these TAGS season sets for many, many years to come.

This fifth ""Andy"" season (which was the last year of the series to be filmed in black-and-white) is filled with funny and enduring Mayberry antics, located within such memorable episodes as .... ""Barney's Uniform"", ""Family Visit"", ""Barney's Physical"", ""Three Wishes For Opie"", ""Barney Fife, Realtor"", ""The Case Of The Punch In The Nose"", ""Goodbye, Sheriff Taylor"", ""The Arrest Of The Fun Girls"", ""Opie Loves Helen"", and ""If I Had A Quarter-Million"".

That ""Quarter-Million"" episode features one of my favorite lines of spoken dialogue from the series. After another of Barney's frequent mishaps with his revolver, Andy asks his deputy: ""You want to give me your pants? I'll take them to the artistic weavers"". :)

------------

Some Barney Banter:

Season Five of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" marks the end of an era -- the ""Barney Fife"" era, that is. Sadly for ""T.A.G.S."" fans, Emmy-winning actor Don Knotts, who played Mayberry's clumsy but lovable one-bullet-carrying Deputy Fife for the first five years of the series, left the show as a regular cast member after this fifth season of the show, in order to pursue a career in the movies.

================================================

EDIT (FEBRUARY 26, 2006) --- The news came just one day after I submitted this Amazon review that Don Knotts had passed away at the age of 81. It's quite ironic (and fitting) that this DVD set containing Don's last season as a regular on ""TAGS"" would be made available to the public just days prior to Don's passing. Fans of Mr. Knotts (and Barney Fife) can now enjoy all 159 episodes that make up the first 5 wonderful ""Barney Fife years"" of ""The Andy Griffith Show"", the TV series that made Don a household name in the early 1960s.

Actor Andy Griffith, Knotts' partner in fighting crime in Mayberry from 1960 to 1965, had been a very good friend of Don's for many decades. Griffith, age 79, visited Don in the hospital shortly before his death.

""Don was a small man, but everything else about him was large: his mind, his expressions,"" Griffith told The Associated Press on Saturday (02/25/2006).

""Don was special. I loved him very much,"" Griffith added. ""We had a long and wonderful life together.""

Don Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, on July 21, 1924. During an acting career that spanned more than half-a-century, he appeared in many TV series and more than 25 motion pictures.

One of Don's very first TV roles was when he played ""Wilbur Peterson"" from 1953 to 1955 on the daytime soap opera ""Search For Tomorrow"".

Some of Don's funniest television work (other than as ""B. Fife"" of course) came during his frequent appearances on ""The Steve Allen Show"" in the late 1950s, when he would appear in comedy sketches as ""The Nervous Man"". Don was hilarious in those skits, which were just tailor-made to suit his timid, fidgety acting style.

Don Knotts' death on February 24, 2006, in Los Angeles, was due to pulmonary and respiratory complications. He will forever be missed; but, thankfully, he left behind his Barney Fife legacy on film, and Paramount Home Entertainment has done a bang-up job at preserving all of the Barney episodes of ""TAGS"" in crystal-clear clarity on DVD-Video.

================================================

Barney Fife returned to Mayberry as a guest star in several post-Season 5 Andy Griffith episodes (which all did very well in the ratings for CBS); but that just left Barney-admirers wanting to see more of the wiry lawman during those last three seasons. For me, the show just wasn't the same after good ol' ""Barn"" left for greener (movie) pastures. And I know a lot of other TAGS fans agree with that assessment as well.

Don Knotts won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Mayberry's mostly-inept (but always funny) town deputy. It's remarkable he survived all those seasons on the Griffith Show, isn't it (what with that super-itchy trigger finger of his)? ~wink~

Over the course of those five full seasons he appeared on ""TAGS"", Don Knotts practically BECAME ""Bernard Fife"", playing the part so perfectly in every episode it's no wonder he was singled out for excellence with those multiple Emmy trophies. ""Barney Fife"" is truly one of television's seminal characters in the history of that medium. And, well, somehow, replacing a Barney Fife with a Deputy Warren Ferguson is kind of like replacing Charlton Heston with Pee Wee Herman in ""Ben-Hur"". ~grin~

In the episode ""Barney's Uniform"", Don has to display a whole range of Barney Fife's emotions -- from humor, to anger, to embarrassment, to cowardliness, to tenderness, and finally courage, as he eventually stands up to his nemesis (""Fred Plummer"") in that episode.

Plummer was played by Allan Melvin, who was cast in numerous different parts on TAGS over the years, including a character in the third-year episode ""Lawman Barney"" who was very similar to Fred Plummer. The ""Lawman"" ep. was yet another time when Barney was forced to summon his inner courage to ward off a troublemaker. And, as always, Don Knotts' performance as Deputy Fife in that ""Lawman"" installment is wonderful to see...as he believably goes from ""weak sister"" to ""dependable police officer performing his duty well"" in just 25 minutes' time.

At the end of ""Barney's Uniform"", yet another facet of Barney's character emerges -- his good-sized ego -- when he says this to Andy after having just engaged in a victorious confrontation with Mr. Plummer.....

""I told him the same thing I told you -- I'm a symbol of the law whether I'm wearin' a uniform or the ol' salt-and-pepper. He gives me complete respect or else. He got the message. You know, the bigger they are, the bigger they crumble.""

Now, in the hands of a lesser talent than that of Jesse Donald Knotts, those words I just quoted above probably wouldn't seem funny at all....they'd just seem spiteful and arrogant. But coming from Don/Barney, it's a different story. Don had a truly unique way of being able to perfectly blend the seemingly-unblendable combination of ""a big ego"" and ""likability"". And not many actors could have pulled that off for five consecutive years. But it seemed second nature to Mr. Knotts.

For, no matter how stuck on himself Barney Fife was, Don Knotts always allowed room for that adjective -- ""likable"" -- to find its way into that character he was portraying every week on CBS-TV. And I've yet to meet the person who didn't like Bernard Fife quite a bit. A truly remarkable character in the long history of television.

Thanks, Don, for knowing how to think and act like Barney Fife.

------------

The Season-Five DVD packaging is consistent with the earlier ""TAGS"" seasons produced by Paramount, which I like very much .... although the cut-and-paste photos on this box cover aren't my favorites. (Andy wearing a necktie?! Egads, that's just silly-looking! Andy hardly ever wore a tie. But that, of course, is just a very minor packaging quibble however. But, IMO, the Season-One and Season-Four DVD artwork are the best ones that Paramount has done for this TV series.)

I very much like the innards of the fifth-season packaging however, consisting of three slim plastic cases for the five discs (with unique artwork on each of the three cases). Episode titles are located on the back of each slim case, printed on a simulated ""Parking Citation"" pad, complete with Barney Fife's signature and a little Mayberry Sheriff's Office motto printed at the bottom of each ticket that Barney hands out to the desperate law-breakers of Mayberry -- ""Let that be a lesson to you"" has been printed on each ""ticket"". LOL.

The picture that's found on the case for Disc #5 is the best packaging photo in this collection, in my opinion. It's a very nice-looking shot of Andy, Helen, Aunt Bee, Barney, and Thelma Lou. That artwork should have been used on the outer box cover, IMO. It would have looked much better there than the composite photo that was chosen for the slipcase cover. Too bad they can't be switched around.

The discs themselves each contain unique (albeit somewhat odd) color pictures of an assortment of ""down home"" items, including two things that remind us immediately of Floyd's Barber Shop.

All episode titles are also printed on the back of the outer box too (with corresponding disc numbers), which is a very handy ""at-a-glance"" feature. Each disc contains either six or seven episodes.

------------

A Few More Stats Concerning This 5-Disc Boxed Set:

Video -- 1.33:1 Full-Frame (as originally aired).

Audio -- Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono (English only).

""Play All"" Option? -- Yes.

Special Features -- None.

Menus -- Non-animated design; No music; Main Menu is also the Episode-Selection Menu; No Episode Sub-Menus are included. (Disc 1 has a Menu choice for ""Previews"", which include a few Paramount ads for other DVDs. An option to watch the Previews or go straight to the Main Menu appears when Disc 1 is initially loaded up.)

Chaptering Available? -- Yes. Five chapter stops per show, including a break right after the opening titles.

Paper Enclosures -- None.

------------

So, Mayberry fans, load up your one bullet (or load up any of these finely-produced Digital Discs into the DVD Player, take your pick), and enjoy the last of the Barney Fife treasures in ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Fifth Season"".

Goodbye, Barney. We'll miss you dearly.

2447712,5,B000BYMI5A,"In my opinon, the fifth season of The Andy Griffith Show is the best, mostly due to the characters of Andy, Barney, Otis, Floyd, Thelma Lou, Aunt Bee and Opie being so 'fleshed out' by the time the show reached its 128th episode.  The scripts were top of the line, with (again, one man's opinion) not a single lemon in the bunch.  Some of my personal favorites are:

- Barney's Physical ('How much do you weigh?' - Andy

  'With or without my gun?' - Barney)

- Family Visit (I seem to be in the minority here, but then again, I had some very annoying relatives)

- Man in the Middle ('What's wrong with third party? It's not dirty')

- The Education of Ernest T. Bass ('You care to be my brother-figger?')

- Goodbye, Sheriff Taylor ('He pushed me haaaaard'...assaulted me' - Floyd)

- Otis Sues the County ('There's nothing worse than a torn Calcium' - a 'gassed' Barney)

- Three Wishes for Opie ('I call on you, oh Count Iz Van Tileckie'...)

- Goober and the Art of Love ('Goober, you were on a date-you weren't taking medicine')

- The Case of The Punch in The Nose ('Who punched you? Lamer Tuttle?')

True, the departure of Don Knott's unforgettable rendition of Bernard P. Fife was a blow following season five, but not as devastating as some of the reviews here would have you believe.

I actually enjoy quite a few color episodes in seasons 6-8, though I'll admit the scripts aren't near as consistently good, and I will definitely purchase them to complete my TAGS collection.  At least they were clean family viewing (see any network sitcoms of late?) As Barn once remarked about Goober (in the 'art of love' episode) - 'pathetic'. Hopefully we'll see a DVD release of the 1986 reunion movie 'Return to Mayberry' to complete the set.

Paramount did a good job with releasing the season five box set after the season four fiasco. The episodes are complete, with sharp picture and crisp sound. The original sponsor spots from seasons two & three are fun to have, but they're not missed with the later released DVD sets.

I'm glad to have all five of the black & white seasons in box sets at home now so I can watch them whenever I want.

All the talk about the release of the dreaded color episodes made me think that I wouldn't buy additional seasons, but knowing that Aunt Bee and Andy are out there on DVD, I'll have to get them also. I'll miss Barney and big hearted Thelma Lou, but I can put up with awful Warren, neurotic Helen with her constant blowups & Goober's idiocy.

Sadly, no Barney, no dice. The leap to color and the absence of Barn (or the presence of Warren Ferguson) will be just enough to sway my purchase. I have seen several of the color shows in no particular order in reruns and many just don't measure up. Even the ones when Barney ""returns"" seem like patch work to me. It will be very interesting to see how the sales of Season Six fares versus the first five and I'll bet there will be an ASTONISHING drop-off. I am also anxious to read fan reviews here at Amazon of the dreaded ""color episodes"".

Here in S5 is my one and only ""ultimate"" TAGS episode entitled ""Man in the Middle"". I have never seen such story 180's in a 25 minute episode in my life. The premise begins that Thelma Lou and Barney are on the outs but within 15 mintues through witty dialogue and misunderstandings Andy and Helen are on the chopping block instead! The dialogue is funny, the situation is cohesive and the even ""tag"" is interesting.

They really hit the mark again with the packaging artwork. I just love all the throwback looks and the ""citation"" layout is quite superb. I thought a nice touch would have been to have the citation number as either 1964 or 2006:) The picture quality seems very nice and (so far) no missing laugh tracks.

In Season Four, the complete epsisodes were released, HOWEVER, they deleted the laugh track from four episodes, which makes for strange, unsettling viewing, and detracts form the overall quality of the shows.  So who know what we have in store with Season Five?

8094317,5,B000BYMI5A,"I assume that this being the fifth season, that you now know what you have bought the previous seasons. Now you are ready for episodes 128 through 159. I also assume that you did not get your fix with just the first four seasons.

For those people who are buying the fifth season (1964-65), before viewing the first, the Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young; don't look at that old dude that is now a producer of exceptional movies. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This series will bring back old memories or can also create some new ones.",1506643200,3,1049,4.453125
