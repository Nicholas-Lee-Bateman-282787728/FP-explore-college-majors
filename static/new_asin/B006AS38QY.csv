4981925,5,B006AS38QY,"Great cast, great story line, great acting and action. Released in 1953 and still a tribute to our soldiers. What else is there?",1383350400,2,128,4.608695652173913
4981926,4,B006AS38QY,"That remark above is from some anonymous infantryman, those words printed on the title card that precedes the movie. 1953's TAKE THE HIGH GROUND! casts Richard Widmark in about as perfect a role for him as could be. Widmark plays hard-as-nails U.S. Army Sergeant Thorne Ryan, a fighting man exiled stateside but who itches to return to the Korean combat zone. Except that his requests for transfer keep getting denied, and so he's stuck in Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, molding and training raw recruits for combat. Oh, it chafes him.

It's not like this is a new formula. It's an old hat wartime narrative that dates farther back than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Way-Ahead-The-Immortal-Battalion-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B000JD7WTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Way Ahead ( The Immortal Battalion ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - United Kingdom </a>](1945) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Go-for-Broke/dp/B0007OP1XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Go for Broke</a>&nbsp;(1951) and probably peaked in the mesmerizing first half of Stanley Kubrik's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>&nbsp;(1987). TAKE THE HIGH GROUND! presents an authentic peek into army life back in the day. The training regimen in 1953 bears close familiarity with how my own naval boot camp went back in '87. Certain scenes reminded me of the exercises in the gas chamber and on the gun range and the endless marching drills. The sergeant's disparaging remarks to his newbies are classic textbook material. I was big grinning because those were the very same words my company commander yelled at my group in boot camp (""You'll never make it!""). Make no mistake about it, in the U.S. Army, the sergeant is the backbone, the hub of every grunt's universe. In the field, give me a sarge over a lieutenant any day.

Karl Malden plays second fiddle as Sgt. Laverne Holt, the good cop to Widmark's bad cop routine. But even Sgt. Holt grows concerned about how unfailingly harsh Sgt. Ryan is to his men. It doesn't help that both sergeants get involved with the same dame, a troubled young widow (Elaine Stewart) who suffers guilt trauma from abandoning her G.I. hubbie who then got killed. For what it's worth, it's an interesting romance. I couldn't predict which direction it would go. It does lead to one surprisingly steamy scene (for its time). Both the girl and Sgt. Ryan are damaged goods, and this generates palpable story conflict. It certainly lends to the tension building between the two sergeants.

Is sixteen weeks enough time to impart life-saving skills and the proper state of mind on a fresh-faced soldier, especially when there actually is a war on? The drill instructor doesn't have time to play nice and mollycoddle. The recruits comprise of stock characters, of which the two most interesting are Russ Tamblyn's mouthy acrobat and William Hairston's scholarly African-American. There's also a skittish coward in the lot and a clumsy fella who keeps dropping stuff (like rifles) and a guy from Texas who loves his cowboy hat. In whipping them into shape, Sgt. Ryan toes a precarious line between discipline and brutality. Heck, his lieutenant even cautions him to watch his step. Richard Widmark is so good at projecting seething turmoil and barely checked fury, it's almost jarring when he does reveal a moment of warmth, a softer side. TAKE THE HIGH GROUND! is worth watching for Widmark's gutsy play on the firing range alone, but there's more to the film than Widmark's ba11sy grandstanding. This is a fine wartime drama, elevated by that touch of verisimilitude and by Richards Brooks' surehanded direction and by strong performances from Widmark, Malden, and Elaine Stewart. But, I wonder, did Sgt. Ryan ever get his transfer finally approved?

Note, by the way, that the DVD advertised here is an import, a Region 0 DVD. So, unless you've got an All-Regions DVD Player, don't get this.",1351555200,5,4126,5.575757575757576
8495815,4,B006AS38QY,"Great story of the Corps. Even while competitive, two drill sergeants are friendly and portrayed by top talents Widmark and Malden. Story moves right along and features easy on the eyes Elaine Stewart. Glad to add this one in to that era of rewatchable 50's B&W shows",1521936000,,267,4.702127659574468
8495816,1,B006AS38QY,The story was good up until the end and then the DVD would freeze up. I don't really know how it ended.,1510012800,,103,3.727272727272727
8495817,4,B006AS38QY,"Some parts not entirely realistic but overall an entertaining movie. Basic training ""experience"" not consistent with today's Army but a lot like my experiences. Haircuts were a bit closer than the movie. 1st liberty later in training and a lot closer to base.",1490227200,,259,5.046511627906977

8495819,4,B006AS38QY,"I was disappointed in this movie.  I went on the internet and requested a list of Marine Corps movies.  This movie was one of them that came up on the list.  It was NOT a Marine Corps movie.  It is an Army movie of what boot camp was like for an Army recruit.  If you are a former member of the Army then you might enjoy it, but as a former Marine, I found it very unenjoyable and funny to see how easy that a member of Army had it at boot camp.  There is no combat in the movie, all of it is at an Army boot camp.  So, if you are in the Army, then you might enjoy it, but if you are a Marine, then you will not.  The movie was good, because I like Richard Widmark.",1489017600,,665,3.7

8495824,5,B006AS38QY,"Absorbing movie. It is not...repeat, NOT...a war movie per se (though a brief opening sequence involves Korea). It is, rather, a BASIC TRAINING movie, with Richard Widmark leading the way in training a bunch of raw recruits for infantry combat. Anybody undergoing Basic in the 1950s or 1960s will certainly see many familiar things here. The training with gas masks in the tear gas hut is ""spot on"", as is the live-fire infiltration course. As to the live fire sequence, I underwent this in the spring of 1968 and it was done at night (whereas the movie is daytime). In the dark the course is spectacular, as you had glowing tracer rounds sailing over your head while you crawled underneath and through the obstacles. I liked it so much I asked my D.I. if I could go through again (to which he replied, ""Hancock, you are CRAZY!). The one technical PROBLEM with the film, though, comes at this point in the film...the infiltration course. Something happens to the SOUNDTRACK at this point and you lose the sound of the hammering machineguns AND the boom of the bunker-contained explosive charges that go off along the trainees' crawl route. Its like the studio sound effects (the ""Foley Effects"") just weren't added. Makes for something of a ""bummer"" of a sequence. Otherwise the film is involving an entertaining. It harkens back to the training sequences of such films as ""Sands of Iwo Jima"", ""The D.I."", ""Battle Cry"", and ""An Officer & A Gentleman"". The last mentioned film, ""An Officer And A  Gentleman"" has a strong resonance to ""Take the High Ground"", as both films begin with a retinue of green-as-grass recruits getting ridiculed, harassed, terrorized,  and ""dressed down"" by their new drill instructors (particularly ""Gunnery Sergeant Foley"")....and both end with the ""newbies"" making the grade and leaving base to see a NEW bunch of  ""maggots"" being brought in to be terrorized, etc. The wheel turns full circle. Widmark is Widmark and that is always a GOOD thing, and Karl Malden does a fine job in a ""sidekick"" role. Truth to tell, if you are a veteran there is a lot in this movie to make you smile. And  make you remember.",1469404800,5,2135,4.793478260869565
