815548,5,6304235445,"An Albert Pyun production can threaten the mental stability of even the most diehard B movie fan. This director is a master of cheesy, low budget films loaded with hammy acting, molasses like pacing, and terrible scripts. As far as I know, there are only two Pyun films really worth watching: the early 1980s sword and sandal picture ""The Sword and The Sorcerer"" and this movie, the 1993 science fiction thriller ""Nemesis."" Two good movies out of a slew of stinkers doesn't mean I wouldn't watch any of his clunkers, though. If anything, a bad movie always promises to deliver a few laughs. Anyway, Pyun's name is synonymous with junk in B movie circles. Just scan some of the movie review sites on the Internet and laugh out loud at the abrasive comments aimed in Al's direction. The success of ""Nemesis"" eventually led to several sequels, each a victim of diminishing returns. The first one is a winner worth watching, but still contains plenty of plot holes for the discerning viewer to giggle over.
Los Angeles cop Alex Rain works hard to break up crime rings and terrorist groups. It's the year 2027, and humanity has changed quite a bit in the near future. It appears that technology dominates, with doctors capable of implanting robotic machinery directly into the human body. In 2027, you've got millions of people ambling around the country with implants, many of them more machine than human. The growing numbers and strength of these cyborgs is starting to become a real problem for the rest of humanity. Eventually, some people fed up with the increasingly metallic composition of the population form resistance groups to fight the growing cyborgs. It is Alex Rain's job to help keep the peace, and to bring in these people when they break the law. After all, killing a cyborg is still a crime since most of these creatures still possess a significant percentage of human parts. Many of Alex Rain's fellow police officers have machine implants. Actually, Rain himself has a few parts in him, too. In the future, it is just too difficult to discern who is completely human and who isn't, and it's about to get much harder. After a lengthy opening sequence that shows us how Alex ends up in retirement, the movie starts in earnest.
Rain's old boss, Farnsworth, approaches him about a new mission. The United States and Japan have decided to merge into one country (a process not unusual in the near future, according to the movie). A cyborg that worked with the police rebelled against the system and took some important information about the merger with her to Java, where she is presently hiding out while attempting to contact a terrorist organization named the Hammerheads. Rain, who has a contentious history with this sexy cyborg, must go to Java and kill her in order to retrieve this critical information. Rain reluctantly goes for reasons made obvious in the film, and soon discovers that things are not quite what they seem. It turns out that the mission Farnsworth sent Rain on is merely a cover for a much more important mission involving the fate of the planet, humanity, and the cyborgs. We don't find this out for some time, and until we do, the movie does tend to confuse the viewer. Not to worry, though, as you can content yourself with the bevy of beautiful women wearing tight skirts, some nudity, massive amounts of gunfire, and a healthy dose of bloody special effects. ""Nemesis"" may well rank as one of the most violent shoot 'em ups made in the last few years. The movie contains elements that reminded me of both ""The Terminator"" and ""The Matrix,"" although I wouldn't go so far as to say that ""Nemesis"" serves a bridge between those two movies. I will say that if you love films overflowing with huge guns and a super high body count, you will love this Pyun picture.
The plot zips along at mach speed, but the acting often fails to engage. Lead star Oliver Gruner, a French actor who must have once been on the same ""up and coming action star"" list as Jean Claude Van Damme, tanks as the tough yet caring cop Alex Rain. I suspect Gruner graduated from the Joe Dallesandro School of acting because his wooden expressions to some extent resemble those of the co-star of ""Blood for Dracula"" and ""Flesh for Frankenstein."" The female stars take second fiddle, and are usually on screen to serve as eye candy for the mostly young male audience that would watch a film like this one. At least ""Nemesis"" gives us the ever reliable Tim Thomerson in the role of Farnsworth, along with late B movie star Brion James as one of Farnsworth's sidekicks. James's pseudo German accent alone makes this movie worth watching. In fact, I doubt I would have even watched this movie if I hadn't known beforehand that Thomerson and James appeared in it.
The DVD gives us several extras, including a trailer and some behind the scenes action about the film. The extras list said there were a few television spots, but when I selected that option, I got more behind the scenes footage. At least the transfer is decent, although it isn't as good as it should be. Colors occasionally look washed out, and there are a few rips on the print. Overall, I give a hearty round of applause to Albert Pyun. It is going to be tougher for me to criticize this guy after watching ""Nemesis."" The movie not only entertains, it is entertaining enough to watch again. This picture just goes to show that even a hack filmmaker can turn out a great treat every now and again.",1066003200,30,5467,4.6780893042575284

815550,5,6304235445,"This is a great action film. I don't know if it borrowed from what had been done before but it was exciting. It was the first time I saw a hero slide backwards, on his back, down a hill, and shoot at the persuers as they came over the hill after him.
Olivier Gruner's performance has been criticized for lacking range. I thought his deadpan, stoic emphasis was JUST RIGHT for this role: a cyborg.
Merle Kennedy was a delight. This was the first time I had seen this actress, and she is marvellous as ""Max Impact."" She knows how to act. Her only other BIG roles are in Night of the Demons 2 and Perry Mason The case of the Heartbroken(?) Bride. She also played a drug addict in one of the best early episodes of E. R.

However, on the ride down from edginess there are quite a few awesome action scenes and a pretty decent story. At  the end what made the movie disappointing for most was the main bad guys  weren't all that edgy. They were however Tim Thomerson and the late Brion  James who are always a treat to watch in the genre. That and the effects at  the climax need to be updated with modern cgi.

815554,4,6304235445,"I must have watched this movie a dozen times by now.  Yes, it's not Cyberpunk in the Gibson sense, but it is cyberpunkish in the Cyberpunk2020/Shadowrun sense.

815556,1,6304235445,"I was deceived by the cover text.  This movie  purports to be a ""cyberpunk thriller,"" but if you started thinking William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, Wilhemina Baird, Melissa Scott, etc. etc.  -- think again.
A few cyberpunk SF buzzwords are tossed into this  incoherent flick to fool the reviewers.  In fact it's just another Z-grade  actioner starring a bunch of body builders, fashion models, and plenty of  large projectile weapons.  Plenty of explosions.  Some very low cost  locations.  Some very bad dialogue.  At least the cast got to visit Mauna  Kea :-)
The movie has a few moments of self-conscious humour and a few  moments of cinematic style, but mostly it's just the same old same old --  if you loved Van Damme in 'Cyborg' then you'll probably like this one too.  If you were expecting something cerebral, moody, and noir -- forget it.

All these years later, I won't sit here and tell you it's the best sci-fi film ever made, but it is still solid as long as you don't try to take it too seriously. This is not a real thinking man's sci-fi movie. More of a fast and fun ride that pops a few morality questions into the mix between action scenes. The special effects are definitely dated, but the saving grace here is the action scenes. Epic to the point of being unheard of in B-movies of that era. Here we see Olivier shooting a circle through the floor to escape years before Kate Beckinsale's hot leather clad self did it in Underworld. For it's shortcomings it's still fun for the age and budget with which it was made. Another movie around the same era that you should check out if you want to load on the B-movie action cheese is Split Second starring Rutger Hauer....same fast fun ride, but instead of machines being the baddies, you have a ""demon/satan/whatever in the heck it was supposed to be"" bad guy, lol.",1348617600,,1087,4.3861386138613865

The box it came in seemed cheap. The insert in the box looked almost like a good photocopy. There was nothing else in the box except that little insert and the dvd.

**The movie itself**
The movie, while sounding very unique and intriguing, is actually fairly meh. I think my expectations were just too high. It's a B or C sci-fi flick. It had a lot of potential that didn't pan out. Robot movies are totally gnarly, but with this one I was disappointed.

**Overall**
This was not worth the ~$20 I paid, but it is out-of-print, so I guess this price is expected. Other places were charging over $50 for it. Out-of-print or not, it's not worth ~$20 to me.

815873,4,6304235445,"Albert Pyun's movies usually aren't worth more than half a glance. Though he's directed some of the more creative of celluloid premises, his films tend to be underdone action C-titles featuring poor casting, even worse acting, bare-bones production values, and a consistently bland color scheme that makes the movies boring even to look at. Though he never really outdid his breakout attempt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-and-the-Sorcerer/dp/B000059PP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword and the Sorcerer</a>) and lost just about all of his Tinseltown value after 1993, he just managed to squeeze out one more good hunkajunk before going off of the cinematic deep end when he made ""Nemesis"": a sci-fi shoot-'em-up combination of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;and John Woo's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled/dp/B00004W458/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard Boiled</a>, and the launchpad of Olivier Gruner's career as an action hero.

The story: in the year 2027 - when America and Japan have merged into a single entity and robotic implants are commonplace - Alex the cyborg cop (Olivier Gruner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Town/dp/6305232776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Town</a>) is strong-armed into accepting a final mission from his superior (Tim Thomerson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Eagle/dp/0767827686/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Eagle</a>): stop his ex-partner (Marjorie Monaghan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Rangers/dp/B0002B95XU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Rangers</a>) from smuggling data to the Red Army Hammerhead terrorist organization. However, even with a security bomb attached to his heart, Alex begins to question his assignment when it becomes clear that the sides of good and evil and man and machine are not as clear as they seemed...

At the time, Olivier Gruner was fresh out of his kickboxing career as France's first-ever national champion, so go into this movie expecting a dramatic performance akin to those of Jean-Claude Van Damme. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't a lot of martial arts to be seen, but the film more than makes up for the sheer amount of bullets it blows through the sets. While there isn't quite as much shooting as in the aforementioned John Woo film, ""Nemesis"" really was the only respectable challenger to that one at the time. I wouldn't be surprised if an entire fifth of the movie focused solely on Gruner and company waging a machinegun war on eachother. There's loads more interesting gunplay than was the timely norm, as well: prepare to see a lot of two-handed gunslinging, mid-air and on-the-slide firing (including a neat instance wherein Gruner bulls-eyes an enemy while performing a backflip), and general ingenuity to spell out a perfect guilty pleasure for action fans.

Pyun's more competent in his directing here than usual, as well. Though it looks like most of the sets were there to begin with (i.e. they look cheap), he makes good use of them, presents a surprisingly wide scope of environments, and leaves his usual technical snafus at home. Alas, the movie's special effects are well behind-the-times, even when the film was released: keep in mind that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day/dp/B001VLBDD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 - Judgment Day</a>&nbsp;had come out two years prior, and the questionable robotics and stop-motion climax will look fairly disappointing. The same can be said for the acting: since this is an action film and Olivier Gruner is an action hero, his performance can be excused, but with the exception of Thomerson, the rest of the cast is in need of help: campy Marjorie Monaghan, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>), Merle Kennedy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/May/dp/B00009MEC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">May</a>), and Nicholas Guest (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer-4-The-Aggressor/dp/B0001BPSAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor</a>) needed to be hit with the script a few more times before they attempted their scenes.

As anything other than an action movie, ""Nemesis"" deserves a lower rating, but if you know what to expect when going in, you'll be setting yourself up for an enjoyable 95 minutes.

For a movie this old the effects were done pretty dang well, I can compare it to the effects of the 80's remake of ""The Blob"" or close to ""Robocop."" Though some of the effects can be cheesy like the final battle or the death of a couple robots but others like the shifting face and eye surgery sequence is good.
  Besides the effects the story is lacking in depth and the scenes lack anything resembling time, like one scene is the recovery of the main character and next scene with no indication of time length is him recovered and on a mission. Stating the time is annoying but if their is no statement with a move that big is just confusing. Still again the actors are hilariously bad, the story seems unbelievably rushed in it's making and the action is cool. Perfect funny-bad movie.
