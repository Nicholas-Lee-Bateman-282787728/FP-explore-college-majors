8124562,5,B000FL6YU4,"I saw this documentary first on Netflix and it is both informative and inspiring.  Where else can you find a group of Nobel Laureates being interviewed in one movie?
This movie is the kind worth sharing and seeing again.  A real gem.
I also found that it was a jumping off point for more films and reading.  Here are just a few of the guest speakers with more in-depth material that I found because of ""Nobelity"":

Prof. Richard Smalley -- has an high-level YouTube video presentation called ""Our Energy Challenge,"" along with a companion article online ""Future Global Energy Prosperity:  The Terawatt Challenge"";

Prof. Steven Weinberg -- with an excellent book about 20th century science and US-Russian cooperation called ""Lake Views.""",1386288000,,737,5.049586776859504
8124563,5,B000FL6YU4,Folks with any interest in our world should watch it.  These Nobel Laureates contribute with great introspection and insight recommendations for moving forward in today's world.,1369180800,2,177,5.8076923076923075
8124564,5,B000FL6YU4,"Turk Pipkin (Night Court's perpetual cross-dresser, writer, et al.) and his team at Nobelity.org put together an inspiring set of interviews with some of the best minds then living.  Each of them brings a unique set of experiences to the table to elucidate and address some of the key issues in our world.  Everyone should see this sooner rather than later.",1337817600,2,357,4.836065573770492
8124565,5,B000FL6YU4,"A great video sharing human wisdom for seeing and improving life for all on this planet.  I share it with all my friends.  I hope you will to.  Anita Owen, Salem, Oregon",1313193600,3,169,4.21875
8124566,4,B000FL6YU4,"great film...the production and cinematography were not very impressive, but the concept was inspired and the messages of the Nobel winners was informative and wonderful...Overall very inspirational, but it doesn't quite hold up to being watched over and over...",1193788800,3,262,5.743589743589744
8124567,5,B000FL6YU4,"This movie should be seen by the whole family, especially the kids. Even though kids under 12 might have a few problems understanding some of the ""big words"" used by the nobel laureates, they will understand enough of it to make it worth while. I was afraid this movie might be a bit too preachy or overly sentimental but I was wrong. It fundamentally gives us hope in humanity. The one thing that makes this really diverse group of Nobel prize winners similar is their optimism, even though they all are facing in one way or the other, very difficult and complex problems. What struck me was that Nobel prize winners are not necessarily genius types (although being a genius is helpful) but some of them are just ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I was particularly struck with the African lady, winner of the Nobel peace prize, who started a simple movement that resulted in the planting of over 3 million trees by mostly impoverished women.

This film deserves every accolade, should win prizes, but I'm afraid it could be forgotten due to all the hype surrounding so many other films. Unlike Al Gore and Michael Moore, who are masters of promotion, Turk Pipkin is just a gentle man trying to present serious issues in a fairly entertaining format. Perhaps high school teachers will pick up this film and make it a centerpiece of classroom discussions, but I think it is mostly appropriate as a family experience.",1189728000,7,1426,4.77327935222672
8124568,5,B000FL6YU4,"Director Turk Pipkin realizes there are many problems with the world.  To find the solutions to those problems, he does not go to politicians or corporations.  He instead tries something new, and asks some smart people: Nobel Laureates.  He travels the world, and finds surprisingly simple solutions to some of the worlds greatest troubles.  After seeing how easy it is to do something that could be so great, you will feel compelled to act.",1163980800,8,441,4.918918918918919
8124569,5,B000FL6YU4,"Frankly, I thought ""Nobelity"" might be a bit boring, when I first heard about it. But, no, it's an absolutely fascinating title that offers answers to some of the world's pressing problems from a number of Nobel prize winners (and who is better qualified!). I wish they had taken on the world's biggest problem, tobacco, a drug which kills 5,000,000 users and hundreds of thousands more innocent people (that breathed toxic tobacco smoke) around the world every year, but maybe they can do that in the next edition.",1161907200,6,515,4.863636363636363
8124570,5,B000FL6YU4,"This is a great film, pure and simple.  And it is a great film because of its purity and its simplicity.  Director Turk Pipkin relentlessly travels the globe to find answers to the very difficult questions regarding man's survival here on earth.  In his travels he interviews nine Nobel Prize winners, some with complex answers to Pipkin's question, and others with a very simple view on our reality.  The interviews are quite riveting, combines with superior cinematogrophy, and editing make this film a must see.  And will get the viewer asking, ""What can I do?""",1158624000,11,564,4.894736842105263
