8264562,5,B001715E5W,"I'm a big fan of Spinervals bike training series.  We have a treadmill at the firehouse gym with an old VHS hooked up so I bought this as an opportunity to try out Coach Troy's running workout while I'm on duty.  In short, I love it!  It's a great quality workout that takes less than an hour including warm up & cool down.  I would recommend this to any runner who has access to a treadmill with a VHS, especially at the price for VHS these days!",1302998400,,447,4.103448275862069
