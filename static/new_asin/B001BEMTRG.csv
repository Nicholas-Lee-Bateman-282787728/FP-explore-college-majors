8282951,2,B001BEMTRG,My 5 year old son loves monster trucks.  He has other monster jam videos that he loves to watch.  He hated this one.  It's just a bunch of quick clips with a lot of talking in between.  Definitely not what we expected.  Waste of money for us.,1356652800,,242,4.0638297872340425

8282953,3,B001BEMTRG,Bought this for my 3 yr old who constantly asks to watch monster truck crashes and freestyle on you tube.  He lost interest  during the interviews - which seemed to go on forever..,1305072000,,180,4.424242424242424
8282954,4,B001BEMTRG,"We got this for our kids, and they love it.  They watch it practically every day.  for me, it's not horribly interesting after a few minutes, just quick clips of various tricks by bunches of different trucks, and ""interviews"" with a bunch of the drivers that really just remind me of old school WWF wrestling, back when Hulk Hogan was still at it.  Great for preschoolers, but it has put me to sleep, after the 37 millionth time I watched it with the boys.",1238889600,,456,4.404761904761905
