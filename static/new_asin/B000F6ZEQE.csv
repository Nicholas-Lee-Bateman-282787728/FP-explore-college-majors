I am enjoying having this DVD in my collection of Nouwen publications and will make reference to it in my future teachings, etc.",1391990400,,328,4.857142857142857
8118168,4,B000F6ZEQE,"This is a great little video, shot right before and right after Henri Nouwen's death. If you'd like to see Henri interact with his friends at Daybreak, those he wrote about, this is a very good tool. I showed it to my congregation during a Maundy Thursday service. It is in Dutch, I believe, and the only thing I'd change is that the subtitles aren't big enough on screen to show to a large group. Might work better in a small-group setting.",1366156800,,441,4.390243902439025

THE FOLLOWING IS ONE OF THE MANY INSIGHTFUL QUOTES TAKEN FROM THE VIDEO:
""Henri is asked, everyone is looking for identity, the world is offering us false identity, possession, power.  Having something and being somebody.  You have given up those things.  Can you explain true identity?
The Father told Jesus, You are my beloved, in whom I am well pleased.  You are my beloved Son.  That is your identity.  The devil said: No, identity is fame.  Turn those stones into bread, jump down off the temple, you are important when you have power, but Jesus said, no My identity has nothing to do with these things.  My identity is being a child of God.
Who am I?  Is it what I have?  What people think of me?  Is it what I achieve?  When I think my identity depends on these things, I am always trying to achieve, until I have things, until I am somebody.  The mystery of the Gospel has to do with our identity.  Our identity is to be a child of God.  That is what you really are.  You are my beloved son, you are my beloved daughter.""
An incredibly inspirational video well worth seeing.

8118170,5,B000F6ZEQE,"This is a video about the life and death of Henri Nouwen--told in his own words and in the words of one of his closest friends and the founder of the L'Arche communities, Jean Vanier. The first half of the video takes you to the places of importance in Henri's life, academia, L'Arche, the circus, St. Petersburg, etc. In each place he talks about what he learned there, and his feelings toward his experiences. Henri is speaking Dutch in the movie, but there are English subtitles--and you still get to see the vigor and intensity with which Henri expresses his deeply held convictions. You also get to meet Adam, who was a very important person in Henri's life, and to see the way Henri and he interacted. The whole movie is full of the truth and beauty that every lover of Henri has come to know as a part of him. It is a really meaningful experience to put facial expressions and a life onto books and words that have touched my heart so deeply. As is also true of his books, the main themes in this movie are people claiming their true identities as children of God, and of living in such a way as to bear lasting fruit. After the biographical aspect which includes interviews with Henri, the second part of the video is actually the eulogy at his funeral--delivered by Jean Vanier. That is also very moving and inspirational, and really iterates the main teachings of Jesus that Henri was so fond of living out. Since buying this video I have watched it many times, and will continue to; in fact, I quote to others or just think about lines from it daily. If you are a fan of Henri's books, or simply want to know about a man who really took the Gospel seriously and used his suffering to benefit us all, then get this movie. I really cannot recommend it highly enough.",1020211200,26,1775,4.431192660550459
