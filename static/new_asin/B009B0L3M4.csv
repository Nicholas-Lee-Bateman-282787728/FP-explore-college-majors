8538961,5,B009B0L3M4,"""NOVA Science NOW"" is a new offshoot of the long running PBS science series NOVA, produced by WBGH in Boston. Each of the 54-minute shows is divided into four or more segments, but the episode has one umbrella topic. I discovered the series last year and have already watched a few of the shows and am now a big fan.

First off, the series is hosted by a guy named David Hogue. I'm never heard of him before but he is funny, in a satirical way. He's an ""everyman"" just like you and me, who is curious. And it's his curiosity that draws us in. And sometimes he submits to stunts to help prove a science theory.

This episode will be of interest to animal and pet lovers, especially the first four segments: ""Do Animals Know Right From Wrong?"" Do rats have empathy? Does your dog have a guilt complex? You'll be surprised at the answers. The second section tries to explain how homing pigeons can find their way home when taken 200 miles and released. Different scientists have different answers. Bees and fish bond together to work together and increase their intelligence. That's the third chapter. Every show has a fourth ""Profile"" chapter and this one concerns a Yale University scientist studying a community of more than 900  monkeys who live in a ""society"" similar to us.

In the less-than-an-hour I spent watching this DVD I learned a lot of useful facts and anyone who watches The Nature Channel will probably get a lot out of this DVD as well. Yes, it's science - and there are a few (very few) technical terms used - but it is, mostly because of Hogue, a lot of fun to watch.

There is a scene selection menu but no bonus features in the DVD.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
