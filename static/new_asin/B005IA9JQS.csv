8474484,3,B005IA9JQS,If your a Ed Wynn or early TV fan you'll overlook the rather corny vaudville style entertainment and grainy kinescope quality and enjoy this. It's truly peering into what TV was like in those early post-war years. Ed's little ad-libs here and there are the funniest parts! I only wish they left in the great original camel animated commercials.,1356652800,2,344,4.8474576271186445
