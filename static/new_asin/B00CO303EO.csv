5731353,1,B00CO303EO,"The covers look good, but the equipment used seems to be only technically fair quality and the end result is a waste of time and effort. The scenes selected are boring and mostly nondescript. You could be anywhere on the planet to get a lot of these images. Worse still is that whilst the images may be stereoscopic, aesthetically and graphically they are as a flat as a sheet of plain paper. It seems the makers have no idea about video post production and how to make an image more appealing. The colours are muted, flat and there is a distinct lack of contrast and saturation. On a big screen, natural is not what you need.

Watching any one these films gives an immediate impression of a person with a Fuji 3D camera (you know the one, the size of a regular pocket compact camera and costs about $150), not even paying the entry fee into a park but sneaking under a fence and grabbing the easiest footage they can, without actually moving far and without having access to anywhere interesting,

It seems that the whoever it is making the creative/cinematic decisions for these movies hasn't got a clue, on how to capture interesting footage, how to process that footage nor how to script interesting an informative narration. I doubt they know very much at all about where they are filming.

In the past 3 years I have purchased a bunch of 3D documentaries, including Rainforest, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountains, with Papua 3D being the worst and biggest rip-off, The truly great ones are Hubble and Space Station, The Universe series, Legends of Flight (not as good as the space stuff), in fact most IMAX productions are pretty good. With the exception of Grand Canyon (good but not great), the rest are just rubbish. The undersea movies all look good and while 1 or 2 or pretty good, they get boring very quickly because they are all too similar.

In future, I will not even consider another of the useless boring documentaries, not unless it is an IMAX or a BBC production.",1393372800,4,1977,4.6239316239316235
5731354,1,B00CO303EO,"This video was BY FAR the worse 3D I have EVER seen.  Obviously not shot in 3D, the processing of the video was so poorly done that it actually looked almost like 3D scenes from a pop-up book!  In addition to that, they repeat the same scenes OVER AND OVER -- I saw the same tree on a hillside 3, 4, maybe 5 times in the video.  Finally, the music is depressing.

The whole thing reminded me of the scene in the movie SOYLENT GREEN when the old man is dying and he lies there watching videos of nature.  There was very little that was GRAND or MAJESTIC -- the way the Rocky Mountains made me feel when I first visited them!  HOW SAD!!!

The ONLY IMPRESSIVE thing about this video is that somebody could actually market and sell it!  Maybe I should try to process some of my travel videos with some cheap 3D conversion software, box 'em up, and try selling them as well??",1391817600,2,870,4.198795180722891
5731355,1,B00CO303EO,"The first copy I received did not play on my DV player.  I was sent a new one.  That one did not play either, but I had my neighbor try it and it worked fine.  I do not want to replace it, but maybe you can tell me why it will not play on my LG player.",1390780800,2,252,3.3859649122807016
5731356,1,B00CO303EO,"Don't waste your money on this low budget film. If you are expecting see wildlife as the cover suggests, you're wasting your time. There are a few scenes of female elk with their calfs, which by the way are wearing tracking collars and maybe a thirty second scene of big horn sheep. Other than that, the remainder of this documentary is very boring. At times, I felt like I was just watching a picture slide show. The 3D affects in this movie are not that impressive.",1389657600,2,467,4.441860465116279

5731359,1,B00CO303EO,I was really excited to watch this movie. Me and my boyfriend love 3d nature movies. I have to admit we were very disappointed in this one. The only 3d parts  was when branches from trees stuck out. The music was overdramatic. It would be soft then loud in seconds. It also seemed to show the same shots over and over. We Have seen a lot of the Rocky Mountains and don't think  the movie did it justice at all. Hope another movie on the Rocky Mountains comes out that is done better. On the good side the delivery of the movie was fast. Got it sooner then I thought I would.,1388016000,,574,4.116071428571429
5731360,1,B00CO303EO,"This doesn't even rate 1 star.  Go in person it would be much prettier. There are much better pictures on the web than what is shown in this DVD. The filming of this DVD was done in winter. The pictures repeat. The narration is most boring. They give no history of how the pioneers traveled through the Rockies, or any other history of the park. They talk about several species of trees but they don't show them. Wildlife - 1 bird and a small herd of elk. What about the buffalo, hawks, eagles, bears, etc...? Wildflowers? Go in person.",1388016000,2,536,4.414141414141414
5731361,2,B00CO303EO,"I love watching 3D movies on my Samsung TV and have a large collection of IMAX and other 3D movies. Who ever produced this, please try again with the following enhancements: This was a disappointment. This was labeled ""Rocky Mountains"" so I expected to be educated about the Rocky Mountains all the way from New Mexico to the top of Canada. Instead the filming was limited to Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park and in addition, repeated the same picture over and over, just zoomed out or in, or just moving the 3D camera some yards away to another view of the same area. This was basically a collection of 3D still pictures. There was no information about the mountain history and migration of animals, or park service and roads or railroad tracks and early exploration as I was hoping for. I also expected a momentary picture-in-picture map where the camera shot was located. That was not supplied either, so how do we know where these pictures were taken from?",1387584000,3,967,4.727810650887574
5731362,1,B00CO303EO,"I live in the Rocky Mountains and have visited RMNP a number of times.  It is one of the most amazing places I have ever seen.  This film does not capture any of the splendor.  This was by far the most boring nature film I have ever seen.  Staying awake for 60 minutes, waiting for some action was difficult.  It views more like still photos than a film, sometimes you will see a tree branch move in the wind, there is some water flowing occasionally, and once light snowflakes were captured.  The cover art depicts a soaring eagle, a yellow-bellied marmot, and a bighorn sheep.  In this movie you will see no birds soaring or small mammals scurrying about.  There is about three seconds worth of bighorn sheep standing still and a minute at most of the butts of a grazing elk herd.  There is about 5 seconds of a close-up of a bird on a limb that moved its head.  That, for me, was the highlight of the film.  National Geographic this is not.  The narration is tediously dull and contains factual errors, not to mention that it drones on for 5 minutes about global warming fallacies.  Unless you like still mountain photos with little evidence of 3D effects, avoid this waste of time and money.  I watched it and returned it the next day.",1387324800,7,1239,4.424778761061947

8583851,1,B00CO303EO,It was all about  the scenes of Mountains after Mountains. The Wildlife was very sparse. No need whatsoever to offer this in a 3D format. The 3 D was only effective on the edge of the screen with a plant or a tree.,1430697600,,214,3.9767441860465116

8583859,2,B00CO303EO,"Having grown up in the mid Rockies, I was totally disappointed that this did not capture a comprehensive view of the Rockies from Alaska to New Mexico like the description of the back cover states.  Instead, this 60 minute video captures only parts of Rocky Mtn National Park in Colorado....  Nothing against Colorado views; however, there are many more breathtaking views in the Rockies to see.  This video replayed scenes twice, repetitive music... and only captured 4 animals, of which he only discusses three (the 4th animal was an eagle you could see only for a moment when the narrator was focused on the elk).  he film does not even capture changing seasons in the one location....VERY DISAPPOINTED! I bought Yellowstone and Amazon also... not sure if I want to view them now :(

But it was fast delivery- so extra star for fast delivery!!",1396742400,,846,4.8068965517241375
