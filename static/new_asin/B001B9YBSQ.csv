3487198,5,B001B9YBSQ,"I'm a big fan of the Contemporary Fighting Arts DVDs.  ""War Blade,"" covers all the basics of tactical knife fighting with additional information and drills for both advanced and beginner knife fighters. Mr. Franco covers (among other things) the ranges of knife combat, knife grips, knife fighting stances, and knife defense.  He clearly explains the reasoning behind each technique.  I do not have much experience with knife fighting.  After watching this DVD and practicing the drills, I feel much more confident with my knife fighting skills.  I highly recommend this video to knife owners or anyone thinking of purchasing a knife.",1273708800,2,634,5.237623762376238
3487199,5,B001B9YBSQ,"To quote from the War Blade book, ""The best way to defeat a knife attacker is to first become a skilled knife fighter."" I couldn't agree with that statement more, and I firmly believe that anyone else who agrees with it can do no better than the War Blade program. Sammy's concise, logical and realistic approach completely does away with any notion of the glorified fencing that you see in movies that has no basis in reality. Though I hope I never find myself in a knife fight, if I am ever assaulted with a knife I'm confident that the skills I learned and continue to learn from this program will increase my chances of getting out alive dramatically.",1214092800,5,655,4.512605042016807

8282437,1,B001B9YBSQ,I have studied knife techniques in the Philippines.  Grandmaster Rico Carino of CDO is the godfather of my children.  This dvd is a waste of money.  What a bunch of BS.,1474243200,4,168,4.354838709677419
8282438,5,B001B9YBSQ,This dvd is great!!! Very informative and covers all the basics. I wish sammy would come out with a part 2 advanced tactics,1458086400,,123,4.391304347826087

8282440,2,B001B9YBSQ,"not bad, certainly not great. shameless product promotion was tacky",1426464000,2,67,5.8
8282441,3,B001B9YBSQ,"Biased, opinionated concepts and theories. I like Franco's teaching methods, but disagree with his knife vs knife training and then calling other people's teachings as unrealistic.
Seldom in real encounters would a fight ever be knife v, knife.
The first several minutes are liability clauses that just repeat the same things and then he speaks in depth about one certain brand of knife he likes. Hope he got some kick back for the plug!
Also, good luck with the inertia opening of the folder under stress when your being jerked around by an assailant. The student had some trouble demonstrated it at times in the video under no stress.",1421971200,8,636,4.844036697247707
8282442,5,B001B9YBSQ,"The knife is a very misunderstood weapon, and Sammy cuts through the BS. He gives advice on purchasing a good blade, ways to carry it, and goes into actually using it in self defense. My favorite part of the DVD was the section on knife retention, something many people don't teach. His ""no nonsense"" teaching method really shows throughout this DVD.",1415232000,,350,4.754098360655738
8282443,5,B001B9YBSQ,"A true guide to the dangerous and difficult art of knife fighting! I have searched all over for an instructor or video program on this subject, and finally I have found it here! Sammy Franco has done it again! He explains the details of this dangerous aspect of fighting from the angles of attack, to the proper stances, and even advice on what type of knife to look for! If you want to take your weapons training to the next level, this is the program for you!",1415145600,2,461,4.310344827586207
