8128074,5,B000G0DFT2,good training video. should be helpful for anyone trying the trainer at home. but still recommend actually taking the bike for a ride.,1394496000,,134,4.869565217391305
8128075,3,B000G0DFT2,"Just an average road race biking video with really distracting black and white segments, however the commentary by Robbie was good.",1357084800,,131,5.285714285714286
8128076,5,B000G0DFT2,"The basic concept is this: put Robbie Ventura in a criterium road race, put a camera on his bike, put a camera on the bike behind him, and film him in the criterium national championships. When you've got the race filmed, take his bike computer data, including his power output, cadence, heart rate, RPE, and some other information on the screen, and sell it.

Brilliant.

Basically, that's what this is: Robbie Ventura filmed racing in a criterium. You get to ride along with him, watching the race unfold around you as you trigger your spinner or trainer to increase/decrease the workload along with the race conditions. At the end, if you've been diligent about your effort and your resistance, you'll have made a pretty good approximation of racing this event on your home trainer or spinner. There is also some intro and after-event stuff on the disk, as well as a pre-event warm up, and Robbie does a walk-through of the event course in another scene as well. I feel like it gives a nice total package, walking you through the event from beginning to end and includes some interviews with other competitors. Robbie narrates through the race, sometimes through exertion, which helps with the sensation of racing.

I recommend this video to anyone using their bike trainer or spinner at home, whether for fun or because of bad weather, as a really functional way to relieve the boredom of training indoors.",1318723200,,1410,4.818181818181818
8128077,5,B000G0DFT2,"I didn't buy this movie to be entertained.  I bought it for a good workout.  After reading the favorable reviews at Bicycling Magazine, Triathelete Magazine, Road Magazine, Velonews, RoadBikeRider and PEZ, I thought I would give it a shot.

I'm glad I did.

I've lost 55 Lbs in 5.5 months, the last 3 months with cycling.  I use a high end indoor bike trainer right now because it's snowy outside.  I have bought a lot of videos and this one is not my first.  I finally got to this video (I got a lot of cycling videos for Christmas) and it is great, here is why:

I recognize from the other reviews that others didn't find it useful.  I found the cycling video useful when I omitted the music and listened to the narration by former US Postal Pro team member Robbie Ventura.  I decided to attempt as much as possible to follow resistance and heart rate - adjusting my indoor bike as the race goes on.

Doing this and simultaneously listening to the narration bumped up my heart rate and ability to go further in shorter amounts of time in a short period of time.  When the video had the resistance go up, I upped the resistance on my indoor bike.  If it was cadence, I upped the cadence.

One great feature of this video is the power meter which gives a rapid way to see when ""to put on the gas"" (increase my own workload).  To be clear, this is on the video.  So when Robbie Ventura increases his workload, I did the same.

That's the strength of this video, and simultaneously listening to the narration and corresponding my workout to match the video as much as possible.  HR and Cadence take precedence, but watching the powermeter helps give an idea of when I should work harder.  Probably after a while, I won't need to listen to the narration.  Even listening to the course overview was good at least once or twice.  It gave me an idea of what to look for when it is not winter here and I'm riding outside in local rides available where I live.

So if used right, this video can help a person do a great workout.  I would not use it for movie night with friends, but I do use it for a great workout at home on my higher-end exercise bike.

One last thing, Robbie Ventura even gives good info regarding the other teams he's watching during the ride.  This is useful and interesting to understand what's going on in this type of race.",1296259200,2,2340,4.336405529953917
8128078,3,B000G0DFT2,"I received this with my new Cycle Ops Indoor Trainer. I really like the way the DVD puts you into the race and guides you through the recommended intensity levels. I get a really great workout from the DVD. The coaching/commentary can become annoying and I never play the music. Overall, I enjoy using the 30 minute race portion of the DVD and use the warm-up on mute. The rest of the features are not very useful. The DVD advertises that you can choose options to customize your workout but really the warm-up and race are the only workout. The remaining features are just interviews and video from the event. There is a 10-minute preview portion that has some good tips if you are interested in entering racing. I wouldn't purchase the video by its self for the full price.",1263254400,,775,4.542857142857143
8128079,4,B000G0DFT2,"I have done a few Criterium and am no expert, but this video was fun to watch and ride to.  I used my heart rate, cadence and power meter to track my performance and it provide a great workout in the middle of blizzard outside.  I have work with a lot of training videos.  Most have a group of riders sitting on their trainer, not to exciting.  This DVD provides a lot of great scenes of the race and the on bike camera is cool.  The function on the DVD to select different combination will allow for a different ride experience.  I really look forward to using it in my daily work out routine as a great option.",1261958400,,612,4.1440677966101696
8128080,2,B000G0DFT2,"I am so sorry I bought this. It's just a couple of guys who video taped themselves on a ride. Seriously, very amateur in quality and expertise.",1260835200,,143,4.333333333333333
