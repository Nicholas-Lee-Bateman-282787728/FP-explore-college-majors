667541,5,6303503381,"This is the edited version of the hundreds of rolls of tapes that Bill Moyers shot of his long socratean dialogues with Joseph Campbell shortly before Joseph Campbell's death in 1987.
The entire collection is split up into six succinct subject-sequences where Moyers and his editor took different parts of the dialogues and organized them together thematically.  The Hero's Adventure talks about the existence of the idea of the hero in lots of cultures and what role he or she plays in its mythology.  The Message of the Myth talks more about the Jungian idea of the existence of archtypes of the collective unconscious and the metaphorical implications of many well-known myths from various cultures.  The First Storytellers talks about the way environment and the basic necessities of everyday life affects the way the earlier hunting and gathering cultures created much of their mythologies and how they came to terms with the way they had to survive through the use of myths.  Sacrifice and Bliss talks about the changes that came over different cultures when they changed from herding cultures to aggrarian cultures and how they changed their mythologies to suit their new ways of living and also the importance of the idea of the ""here and now""; how heaven and nirvana and things of that sort are not physical places but a metaphorical place within your metaphorical heart and that ""bliss"" is only to be found in the present as you live your own life in the here and the in the now.  Love and the Goddess talks about the idea of person to person love (as opposed to a more spiritual brotherly ""Agape"" love that for instance Jesus supposedly talked about in such aphorisms as Love thy neighbor/enemy); and how that idea altered the way European cultures thought about arranged marriages and Roman Catholic Society mores in general; and also about Love in general which is Campbell's favorite subject; and also about the idea of the Goddess and the role of woman in many of the world's mythologies and various metaphors that exist that symbolize the Woman's power to give birth and what implications these metaphors have on the here and now.  Masks of Eternity talks about the idea of God both the idea of the Personal God (or the vastness of the universe and life given humanized form) and the impersonal god (or the idea that the universe and life has no containable form and that its vastness and all-inclusiveness precludes any kind of mere mortal understanding).
Moyers prepared for these dialogues by reading every one of Campbell's books and the questions he asks can be fairly simplistic at times but at the same time apt and knowledgeable (he asks questions of him and Campbell answers; as a student would quiz a guru in a dialogue from an eastern culture).  Campbell is very knowledgeable about many kinds of mythology and religion and answers him back every time with intelligent amusing and interesting anecdotes, countless memorized recitations, verses and many pointed professorial questions which make Moyers pause and think and in the end helps him and the viewer/reader to understand a lot of what he's talking about much better.  It's not light viewing/reading I warn you; but with several viewings/readings you will get to understand many of the things that connect you to the human race and the universe and see how tragically pitiful we mere mortals really are in our blind groping for meaning in the face of the unfathomable beauty and mystery of Life (not the milton bradley game).",1002067200,194,3509,4.905564924114671
667542,5,6303503381,"The deepest spiritual truths and wisdom that have eluded people of faith have been realized here. Speaking on things that I have always known within, but never able to capture in words. Campbell brings these truths to the surface. It is nothing short of joy to my soul.",999216000,7,269,4.625
667543,4,6303503381,"Because the reviews below already covered so much ground--about the power and prevalence of myth and mythic structures, etc.--I'll veer a bit to the side and say that if you're steeped in mythology and symbolism already, you won't find a lot of new stuff here, except in bits and pieces.  It's a very basic introduction filmed for the benefit of a nontechnical public.
Campbell is always informative and charismatic, but the questions put to him by Moyers are remarkably rudimentary.  Good interviewers sense not only the obvious content of what you just said and feed it back to you (the Moyers style in this video), but also get at the shadows of possibility, the alleyways and grottos behind your words.  Case in point:  Laura Pozzo's way of getting at James Hillman in the book INTER VIEWS.  I'd like to see her on video some time.
If you're either a beginner in this field or teaching other beginners, you can't go wrong with this series.",995760000,16,943,4.725609756097561
667544,5,6303503381,"This series of videos is a true eye-opener and life-changer for anyone who is serious about seeking after the Divine, no matter what religion you may practise.  Joseph Campbell examines the sacred symbolic stories that have existed in every culture, all over the world, with respect for all of them and denigrating none.  At the same time he also strives to drive home the idea that these links to the Divine are not divine in themselves but are paths to knowledge and enlightenment.  One segment, Masks of Eternity, talks about the many ways in which God speaks to us or appears to us-- some of them silly, some of them scary, some of them profound-- all of them simply masks.  The mask of God, or our perception of Him, is often the hardest thing of all to get past in a true search to touch the Divine.  In a sense it gives us permission and encouragement to study and appreciate all forms of religious practise, without ever asking one to give up one's deeply-held beliefs. Indeed, no matter what where one goes to worship or what label one claims to denote one's religious philosophy, this series will help you appreciate your own beliefs even more.  Watch this series and free your mind; remember that God is infinite and none have grasped His Magnificence in all of its myriad forms-- setting your attitudes free will make Him visible in more ways than ever before.  Prepare for an incredible journey.",984355200,211,1408,4.653225806451613
667545,5,6303503381,"I have read all the books of Joseph Campbell, and none of them match the interview made by Bill Moyers with Joseph Campbell. Seeing Joseph answering questions of the human imagination, made me realize that he's a better speaker than writer. It made me see the real man behind extraordinary books. If you are after a visual explanation of what a Myth might be, then this 6 tape documentary is a must for your collection.",970444800,6,419,4.6
667546,5,6303503381,".....it would have been Joseph Campbell.  His books are brilliant, but to see him speak lets you know that it's only out of the deepest love that  Campbell did all that he did. In my opinion, these are required watching  for any student of life.",966988800,5,245,4.4
667547,5,6303503381,"I started watching these videos in Japan on my arrival there long ago. I had run headlong not only into culture shock but also the fact that, for a non-Christian country, the Japanese seemed to be embodying Christian ideals far better than the West.

In walked Campbell. Amazing. I have watched these videos over the years literally hundreds of times and have always enjoyed them. Campbell's story-telling is elegant and always a balm for the day-tired soul seeking solace in the living room reclined before a television.

I really cannot commend the tapes highly enough. They are preferable to the other videotapes in which Campbell flies solo, usually before a crowd which is either mildly hostile or hasn't done its homework. The cordial and informed interaction with Bill Moyers in George Lucas' elegant private library, and the frequent segues to cinema, artwork, and beautiful clips of foreign locales, make the programs a delight again and again.

The first program deals with the hero's  adventure, and is liberally laced with Star Wars' scenes. The second discusses the significance of denotation versus connotation in Christian theology, and includes one Star Wars scene (Vader's death). The remaining episodes range all over the world and hammer home Campbell's (and Moyers') thesis that all religions are true in this sense: They are true as metaphorical of the inner spiritual potentialities of men and women. This is more or less identical to J.R.R. Tolkien's view of mythology, of course.

Particularly fascinating is the footage of a South Pacific cannibalistic ""horror society"" re-enacting THE myth and Campbell's interpretation of it - the death and eating of the god. The male-female pair to be consumed engage in a public, ritual sexual intercourse, are slain in flagrante dilicto, and are immediately cooked and eaten. ""That's the sacrifice of the Mass"", Campbell points out.

""There [in Roman Catholic ritual] you are taught that this IS the body and blood of the Saviour."" One is reminded of Campbell's elsewhere quoting St. Paul: ""Those forms which were merely mythological forms are now incarnate in our Saviour.""

Is there a proviso to my bubbling over about this fascinating six-hour master class in Humanities? Yes. Definitely. My personal opinion is Campbell never received instruction in the Aristotelian-Thomist tradition of the Roman Catholic religion he forsook, as his thinking is not so much clear as agnostic, Modernist, and idiosyncratic. He knows less theology than the cat. But if you are willing to ignore Campbell's unsurpassed non-comprehension of theology and his conviction that all religions are true and no religion is true, and can content yourself with focusing on his expertise in Humanities, he's a stellar teacher.",962582400,49,2765,5.2562358276643995
667548,5,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell is a genius who understands his subject and presents it better than anyone I've ever seen. He is a master teacher and is utterly engaging. Everything he talks about is immediately at hand for him and he  has obviously immersed himself in religion and myth, their similarities and  the symbolism behind them.
The one weakness from this video is the  interviewer Bill Moyers who often times is out of his depth and asking dumb  questions when Campbell has just explained it to him. Despite this, Moyers  was obviously prepared and pulls all the right things out of Campbell who  tells the greatest stories, since he has the greatest material to pull  from.
Campbell doesn't pick one mythology more than any other, he wanders  though Native North American, East Indian, Christian and Buddism and is  equally at ease with any and many more. He is such a joy to listen to and  gives so much in this video series.
In total, there are 6 videos of about  1.5 hours each. I started watching them and pretty soon, my girlfriend was  looking over my shoulder and just sat down and watched the rest and asked  to see the beginning too.
These are a must for anyone who thinks that  religion and mythology are of any importance.",960940800,23,1230,4.6342592592592595

It has an everlasting quality and does not expire through time.  Mr. Campbell  had a unique ability in telling those stories and evoking the understanding  in the deepest part of my conscience.  I highly recommend it to any one  whom is hungry for more understanding of our existence through the stories  and wisdom of our ancestors.,917740800,7,478,4.7560975609756095

667774,5,6303503381,"While it may sound kind of nuts, especially to those who have never cared for TPOM, or who may have watched it only intermittently (when it's aired on PBS during fund drive month) I've probably watched the series in it's entirety no less than 25 times. I can truly say I've taken new insights from it on every viewing, nearly 30 years after it first aired.

I grew up before cable tv was in every house, to say nothing of the internet, or iPhones. I was a kid who loved mythology; I collected a library of books on world myths, from Norse to Native American, from African to ancient Greek and Roman. Watching TPOM for the first time was a turning point in my life.  Here was someone explaining what the myths were really saying, who explained how the religion I had been taught my whole life was connected to ideas from cultures all over the world.  My interest in comparative religion was sparked in that moment by Campbell, who both answered and brought up innumerable questions about philosophy, religion and faith.

In the years since it first aired there has of course been a reexamining of Campbell's personal beliefs, and many have questioned Campbell's integrity, saying he was anti-sematic and anti-christian.  My opinion is that he was neither, his choice to hold Judaism and Christianity no more superior than any other religious belief simply outraged those Judeo-Christian believers who cannot accept that any thinking person would dare to do so.

For me, as a teenager, these conversations were an mind expanding experience.  Even now, so many years later, they inspire me, and provide priceless insights.  In particular I recommend Campbell's recounting of Richard Neihart's book ""Black Elk Speaks' at the conclusion of 'The First Storytellers' chapter.  It is one of the highlights of the entire collection, his passion and insight into mythological symbolism culminating into an inspiring summation.

An invaluable teaching tool, which anyone who aspires to a more sublime understanding of myth and religion should watch. Well worth it.",1408147200,,2053,4.994134897360704

Yesterday,  I sat in front of my computer surrounded by  a glow of happiness. The books by Mr. Campbell are valuable, but to watch him and Bill Moyers, well, what can I say? I watched the expression in Mr. Moyers's eyes change from interested to WOW! I get it, when Mr. Campbell explained the ruling myths. I imagined that my eyes were doing the same thing. It's been a long time....

The other reviews covered the contents of the DVDs in detail. I am not going to repeat them.

However, I will share this: the first time I watched and listened to Mr. Campbell,I was clinically depressed. As I listened to this guru, I could feel my body (including my nervous system) shift and change until the empty spaces were filled and I knew that I was healed. The next day, the therapist confirmed this and listened to my adoration of Mr. Campbell with a smile on his lips and in his eyes. He, too, was a disciple of Mr. Campbell. At this time, I am not depressed, but I am a victim of government. My house was destroyed by the flood waters in upstate NY last Sept. It's been a year and I am still waiting for a buy-out. The conversations between Mr. Campbell and Mr. Moyers are what I need to remain lucid until the circle is closed. These discs will be used time and again.

It has taken me years to finally add the DVD version to my collection, and I couldn't be more pleased! The ""special features"" include much material that wasn't in the original 60-minute programs, and there is soooo much to learn from Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers in their conversations that I recommend this without reservation to anyone with a broad, inquiring mind.

Filmed nearly 30 years ago, this series of questions and answers between Campbell and Bill Moyers is as fresh and as relevant today as it was then.  Using the advent of technology and the computer as a backdrop - as well as the Star Wars series as a ""relatable"" way to convey the power of the hero and the power of the myth, Campbell and Moyers explore the vast realm of myth and tradition - always bringing it back to the individual watching the series.

It is almost impossible to give justice to Moyers inquisitive journalism, and equally impossible to give justice to Campbell's childlike enthusiasm for the topic - even as he is in his 80's when the series was filmed.

If you have never seen it and have an interest in the subject or the man of Joseph Campbell - get it.  It is a MUST SEE.",1329609600,2,1034,4.562162162162162

(Sinatra's Concert for the Americas and Doo Wop revivals are big in my area.)

The charismatic, enthused and quite brilliant Campbell taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 38 years. I would've loved to have attended his courses. He has a way of making the most abstract concepts easily understood, seems to relish recounting fables first spoken by ancient teachers and shamans, and always returns to his main theme: find your bliss, and do it in the here and now.

Journalist and ex-LBJ staffer Bill Moyers interviews Campbell from the proper position of  student to teacher. ""Joe"" as Moyers calls him, reacts happily when his pupil grasps what he's saying, and rephrases a thought when he doesn't. Teacher is patient when Moyers doesn't agree on the meaning of life or divinity, but he never goes off-message, instead pointing out  examples from his own past that powerfully support his views.
.

The sixth and final chapter has a moment that really resonates for me. It was taped just a few months before 83-year-old Campbell's death.

At one point during this discussion of eternity, the professor mentions that he's lost many friends and his parents, yet realizes that they still live within him. I'm more black & white on this. A memory is an intangible, untouchable thing. No matter how vivid, it's not the same as seeing, hearing or being with lost ones. Yet, I recognize that they do sometimes surface in my most powerfully emotional dreams. In that subconscious realm, they truly exist.

I suppose Campbell would've refuted my view in his good-natured way and left me to reassess.  And that is the true joy of this series of talks: they cause you think about things you'd never even considered and appreciate more those that have long been a part of your life.

I love Campbell's way of expressing himself. He brings profound statements in the words of street kids. Here speaks a man steeped in his subject. When you realize that he died a couple years after the last interview, you sense the profound loss of a mind that could enlighten your mind as to why you may be living on this earth.

I recently read the book ""An Open Life"", interviews of Michael Toms with Joseph Campbell, and I find that text clearer yet than the interviews with Moyers. The Moyer's interviews are ad lip and I like Campbell's way of talking in simple terms, which he does in the Toms interviews even more succinct, for example when asked what religion is, he states simply: ""All Religions are misinterpretations of Myths"". To anyone wanting to know Campbell's insights and convictions, I highly recommend ""An Open Life"" with Michael Toms.

If you do not regularly find yourself seeking out documentaries and tend to spend more time in front of Hollywood style films I would encourage you to watch this - but understand that it is something very unordinary here.

I first saw it when it aired on PBS back in the 1980s and was immediately captivated. The thing I like most about it is that one doesn't necessarily need to be of a ""mythological"" mind to enjoy it. All it takes is a willingness to sit awhile and listen. Professor Campbell is one of the most gifted instructors (and for that matter storytellers) out there. Viewers of The Power Of Myth ought not find themselves immediately immersed and gasping in a stygian whirlpool, but rather are led step-by-step in a gentle and almost tender fashion as Campbell lights the way.

668433,5,6303503381,"A wise mentor once said to me, ""Next to sustenance, human beings crave story above all else.""  At first I dismissed it, but over the years I have come to believe its truth.  Above all else, we seek meaning and definition to our existence.  Stories -- and I include movies, books and songs -- give us that validation of universally shared experiences, fears and desires.  It's the picture on the ragged tapestry of our lives that we discern when we step back far enough to see the pattern of our collective stories.

What makes this an exceptional show is Campbell has no agenda and nothing to sell.  He's just sharing a fundamental truth about our collective human experience.  Since our lives are filled with lies and propaganda, from politics, religion and advertisers, here is a welcome opportunity to detox.

The six episodes:  ""The Hero's Adventure"" in which the mythical, heroic life is linked with the stages of our own mortal lives; ""The Message of the Myth"" is about the failure of ancient Creation stories to satisfy our modern need for scientific proof of origins; ""The First Storytellers"" emphasizes the need for ritual, the role of shaman in rites of passage and death as rebirth; ""Sacrifice and Bliss"" reveals how our contemporary needs require new concepts of the mythic modes of sacrifice; ""Love and the Goddess"" shows romance to be relatively new but eroticizing the female is old; ""Masks of Eternity"" grasps the big questions of God and spirituality as expressed by several world religions.

Take again this exhilarating journey into mind, meaning and myth as expressed by a truly extraordinary man and brilliant storyteller.  Hosted by TV journalist Bill Moyers, this great show was originally seen as a highly-regarded PBS series.

Bonus features include:  Never before released conversations with Campbell; selections from Moyers' interview with George Lucas; a 12 page viewer's guide; excerpts from the film SUKHAVATI and more.  About 360 minutes on two discs.",1283731200,2,1982,5.058461538461539

668436,2,6303503381,"In high school I was turned on to Joseph Campbell by George Lucas's remarks about how he used The Hero With a Thousand Faces while working on the original Star Wars stories. Reading that book I found it was a rush to see how so many patterns were repeated in myths.  It then sent me off reading the various myths and stories of various cultures and I largely left Campbell behind because the source material was better.

When PBS ran the series the Power of Myth a few years later I once again dove back into the world of Joseph Campbell only this time I was much less enamored. The trouble was that Campbell was picking and choosing the pieces of myths to show the universal nature of the points he wanted to get across, leaving out the parts of the story that kind of worked against his hypothesis. If a similar story didn't follow his pattern he left it out. I completely understand why he did that and I don't really mind except that he rallies too much a case for across the board universality when it really isn't there.

Campbell, for a brief time, became a media darling and even in colleges his take on myths and legends became the way to go. What's frustrating is that no one was really going back and reading the myths and legends he was talking about, or more importantly not talking about. If you watch the series with any critical eye you see how he tends to choose some belief systems over others.

Don't get me wrong its a very good series, but you can't just let the series be the be all and end all of your quest to know the subject. I had several college professors who handed out copies of various episodes and said this was what we had to know and that was it. It was a lazy thing to do and something that was very one sided (and it stifled what was suppose to be a discussion of religion). You have to start here and go on from it, this series doesn't have all of the answers, it only really starts asking some of the questions. If you make the effort to really go beyond the programs and look into the myths and legends he talks about and those he doesn't, I think you'll find yourself getting a better understanding of the world.

I've rated the series two stars because even though it's a good thing to get the mind going its not the be all and end all. As I've said its Campbell's view and not really the way all myths are, all you have to do is actually start reading the stories to see that.",1281398400,9,2419,4.238611713665944

Other reviewers have made a lot of useful comments about the content, so I won't harp on that subject.  I will say that, if you have any serious interest in the narrative arts, or the development of human thought, or mythology, or attempts by the human race to represent and comprehend life in any way, then you will find this video to be an invaluable viewing experience.  Of course, a serious perusal of Campbell's writings, some of which were illustrated, like this video was (with short clips and still images), would give you more information.  Campbell had a Jungian approach to the study of world mythology, and he had the gift of communicating this subject in a way that is engaging but not watered down.  One of the pleasures of this masterpiece is watching the appreciative back and forth between a gifted interviewer, Bill Moyers (who was often lobbing softballs to his subject, but so what), and the charismatic and down-to-earth scholar, Professor Campbell.

Answer to the koan? You find it.
And much more in this sage multi-cultural adventure. It's memorable and gift-worthy for those looking for themselves in all the wrong places.
However, to my mind, what's missing here is Jung's wisdom in recognizing the Feminine for what it is: a separate psychological reality and pathway beyond
social roles or male projections -- outside of male Hero mythology. (We often experience things differently, such as the phenomena of childbirth)
We're fortunate to have embraced them both on our Planet.",1249862400,,884,5.061643835616438

Few are as charismatic and knowledgeable of this subject matter and as natural a teacher as Campbell. It is a pleasure just listening to the old man recount the old stories and make them come alive. Imagine sitting at a campfire with Campbell as your storyteller. Something in you would be touched as you participate in a ritual older than civilization and as old as our race. The Power of Myth is as close as you can get to being with Campbell at the campfire. But he mostly gets asked a lot of good questions. Questions you'd want to ask him about what it all means, after you hear his retelling of a great tale. Recorded in the late 1980s, shortly before Joseph Campbell's death, it is the culmination of his long, influential life as our society's greatest teacher of the old myths, spiritual traditions, and folklore. It is also one of the great accomplishments in the long and remarkable career of arguably one of America's greatest journalists Bill Moyers.

To this day people are discovering this series and being inspired and it will continue to inspire for many years to come. *Power* of myth. There is power here. Campbell was primarily interested in how these stories could empower YOU. He talked much about societal functions these myths had, but what is best about Campbell seems to me, now years after discovering him, is the inspirational aspect of his work -to the individual- and the delight it provides to your imagination. Worlds open up. Ancient and seemingly eternal. Many have gone before you and many will come after you. You relate to this chain and do not feel alone. Reading Campbell is *fun*. The guy has been accused of being right-wing. Don't know about that. Don't care. Campbell is a humanist. Maybe he'd disagree? But his work is humanistic. Yes, there are debates about Campbell's interpretation of myths and religions. I actually agree with some fundamental criticisms, but I still appreciate this series and very much value my experience of it and I value Campbell's work.",1247356800,,2137,4.807065217391305

668562,5,6303503381,"In 1986, journalist Bill Moyers sat down with mythologist Joseph Campbell for a series of interviews taped at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. The sessions, which aired on PBS in '88 (see Bill Moyers Remembers Joseph Campbell), introduced Campbell's transcendental wisdom to a wide audience for the first time. Joseph Campbell And The Power Of Myth became a bestseller in both book and video form. Campbell's ideas about the narrative structure of myth have influenced a generation of filmmakers and writers, and his crosscultural perspective has inspired millions of spiritual speekers (and infuriated fundamentalist Christians).

The first volume in the Power Of Myth series, The Hero's Adventure, looks at Campbell's favorite area of mythology, the tests and trials undergone by heroes from Prometheus to Sir Gawain to Jonah to Luke Skywalker. ""There are two types of deeds,"" says Campbell. ""One is the physical deed, in which the hero performs a courageous act in battle or saves a life. The other kind is the spiritual deed, in which the hero learns to experience the supernormal range of human spiritual life and then comes back with a message."" There are adventures which are chosen and others into which the hero/heroine is thrown; but ultimately the journey is about a transformation of consciousness. As we read about the hero's adventure, it inspires us in our own lives. ""Myths inspire the realization of the possibility of your perfection, the fullness of your strength, and the bringing of...light into the world,"" says Campbell.

The Message Of The Myth talks about the common threads between many myths -- such as the creation myths of Genesis, Basari legend and the Upanishads -- and how these stories, ancient or modern, can awaken a sense of awe, gratitude and even rapture within ourselves. ""Myth opens the world to the dimension of mystery, to the realization of the mystery that underlies all forms. If you lose that, you don't have a mythology.""

The First Storytellers takes us back to our Paleolithic ancestors, ""to whose lives and life ways we nevertheless owe the very forms of our bodies and structures of our minds."" Mythological themes that came from ancient hunting peoples, as well as from -- later -- the first agricultural societies, still resonate in our dreams, stories and religions. In the 20th century, writers and artists such as James Joyce, Thomas Mann, and Paul Klee have emerged as the new myth-makers.

Sacrifice And Bliss discusses how each of us needs to find our sacred place (a place or an activity that gives us peace and to which we can retreat for a little while every day), how sacrifice leads us to a discovery of our own spiritual selves, and how one way of opening the door to mystical experience is to ""follow your bliss"" (do what it is you love to do). Says Campbell, ""If you do follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't even know they were going to be.""

In Love And The Goddess, Campbell discusses how our current idea of romantic love largely began (in the West) with the troubadours of 12th century Europe, who thought of love as a highly personal ""person-to-person relationship."" Before that in Europe, love was simply Eros (impersonal sexual desire) or Agape (love thy neighbor as thyself; also impersonal). Campbell looks at woman, as goddess, virgin, and Mother Earth.

Masks Of Eternity is in many ways the most challenging of all six Power Of Myth programs, and one in which Bill Moyers the Baptist struggles to reconcile his beliefs with the transcendental ideas of Campbell the global mythologist. ""A myth is a mask of God, a metaphor for what lies behind the visible world,"" says Campbell, who discusses our need for God and the differences and commonalities between gods of different cultures. ""In most Oriental thinking and in primal thinking, the gods are manifestations and purveyors of an energy that is finally impersonal. They are not its source. The god is the vehicle of its energy. But the ultimate source of the energy remains a mystery.""",1215561600,,4233,4.888579387186629

668657,5,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell was an amazing man full of insight and understanding of the religions of the world and how they all are the same metaphorically, and they all share common themes since the dawn of time. I will share some of his perceptions and thoughts that are reoccurring throughout this 6-hour DVD. Every chapter is spellbinding, delightful and distinctive. There is a wealth of information here that will inspire anyone to a spiritual life and the wonders of the great mysteries of life and God as Campbell sees him. Joseph Campbell was an enlightened man full of the wonder and joy of life. Just watching him I feel a deep sense of connection to God and the mysteries of the universal cosmic truths.

 Myths and dreams are transformations of consciousness and are the way to a deep rich life of mystery; transforming thought. The Ego is the dragon holding you in and keeping you small. Following your bliss by doing what brings you vitality within yourself saves the world. The Buddha says that Nirvana is a psychological state of mind that is not compelled by desire, fear or social commitments or acting out of our own center. We are all seeking an experience of being alive; we are not seeking meaning of life since there is none really. It's the inner value we seek and it is not in what we do. The ultimate mystery of being transcends thought and cannot be understood. God is transcendent and God is within our world, others and us. Eternity is here and now. This is it and we must get it from within ourselves not out there and not after we die!  We cannot concretize that symbols as fact. Jesus did not ascend up but within us. All the symbols are metaphors and are not fact. We are all manifestations of Buddha consciousness. Jesus is within us all just as are heaven, and Hell and all the Gods. Inward we are the source. All religions are true for their time. Open up to the mysteries of life of all things, and make a choice to stay in your life and realize the truth and depth of your experience of your own being through consciousness and bliss. Experience it here and now.

Do not judge. Open-up and love thy enemy. These, Campbell says, are Jesus' greatest teachings.

We need to shift the perception to joyful participation in the sorrows of life and everything changes. Find the immoveable center within yourself and we can survive anything and float down the stream of life. To save the world we must save ourselves. The influence of a vital person vitalizes the world. The world is a wasteland and we cannot save the world by shifting it around. Bring it to life by being alive yourself.

Choose to affirm life. Life is great say yes to it. It is a childish way of thinking to say no to life with all its pain. We all participate in evil. No matter what we do it's evil to somebody. If all the universe is Divine how can we say no to anything in the world? Brutality, stupidity, thoughtless ness and suffering; we must say yes. Affirm the world and life. We are not to judge anything. This is the greatest teaching of Jesus. Affirm both good and evil. Do not withdrawal from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but see the horror as the foreground of a wonder. Come back and participate in it.

To be spiritual we need a deep sense of mystery of the dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses. Divinity is the realization of wonder that is much larger then the human dimension. Divinity is just what we think. God is a metaphor of what is guiding you and comes from within. The transcendent mystery is where we come from and we do not have to identify it. I am the vehicle radiant of the spirit, as we all are. The virgin birth is the symbol of the birth of the heart to the awakening of the spiritual life in accord with another or a principle. To not be driven by the lower centers of lust, greed, power and wanting but to be driven from the compassion of the heart to open-up to the realization that God is within the other and us; a whole new life comes.

The ultimate mystery is finding God within you. That God is within us just as he is within the earth and all of nature and everything. God is everywhere. This is the real truth- He is not up in the sky separate from us, but within us and around us supporting us always, and we just need to become awake to this fact. I can see why the goal is to die before we die. To die to our animal and material nature and become reborn to the spiritual nature, which is our true nature.

And he often mentions how we are to live our lives in accord with nature and to worship nature just as most of the world does. Western Christian thought sees nature as fallen and our religion is one of exile that nature is fallen and evil. This is ridiculous Campbell says because what else do we have to worship then nature? All other religions but Christianity, teach to live in accord with nature and the God's are much more elemental of the earth. We come from the earth and are a part of the Earth not separate from it.

Here is a quote from Chief Seattle that Campbell dictates and lives by:
 ""Will you teach your children what we teach our children, that the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth. Earth does not belong to man; Man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. What he does to the web he does to himself. One thing we know, our God is also your God. The earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator. Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of man? When the view of the ripe hills is blocked by talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone. Where will the eagle be? Gone. What is it to say goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival.""",1195776000,4,6020,4.3138815207780725

668861,5,6303503381,"I know that it does sound overly dramatic and even trite to say that a television series truly changed my life, but in the case of, ""The Power of Myth,"" it really is true.

I studied C.G. Jung in College and was introduced to Campbell's written work at that time. It was all very intriguing, but for whatever reason, I never followed up with it then. Not too long after that, my local PBS station ran the entire ""Power of Myth"" series one weekend as a marathon, complete with pledge breaks. I taped it then and for reasons I can't now imagine, I didn't bother watching the series until some years later when I was trying to sort through my tapes. But when I did, it changed me.

In the series, Campbell was able to easily articulate so many ideas that I knew were true, but never knew how to truly grasp or say myself. They also gave me inspiration and courage I didn't know I had in me. I've since then watched the series (or listened to the outstanding CD audio release) many, many, many times. I've read Campbell's ""Hero with a Thousand Faces"" cover to cover a few times over and I'm still making my way through his ""Masks of God"" books.

""The Power of Myth"" forced me to really examine myself, what I was doing with my life, and how I was living it. Five years or so after first seeing the series, I left my very comfortable, very glamorous, very secure corporate job and set out to take the risk and ""follow my bliss."" And now, two years after that, I'm in the midst of following my bliss and while it isn't always easy, there's no question that I'm on the right path and I'm happy and stimulated in ways that I only fantasized about before. Campbell's body of work - and ""The Power of Myth"" specifically - really did change my life for the better and its a reference point which I return to time and again.

The DVD release of ""The Power of Myth"" is vastly superior to the old VHS release simply for convenience and durability's sake alone. As an extra, the DVD also adds a bonus Bill Moyers interview with George Lucas in which Lucas discusses mythology. It's a welcome addition to be sure, but why not release the entire hour long ""Mythology of Star Wars"" interview which this interview was excerpted from? I'm glad I still have my PBS taped VHS of that one!

Anyway, I'm certainly not complaining. Perhaps ""The Power of Myth"" won't have the same effect on others that it has had on me, and that's fine. Go ahead...live your life...you don't need Joseph Campbell interviews to do that. But ""The Power of Myth"" changed - and continues to change - the course of my life for the better and I'll be forever grateful for that.",1133481600,46,2629,4.379098360655738

My favorite Quote from him is, ""All religion is true one way or another when understood metaphorically, but when taken literally then your in trouble."" The trouble he was talking about is Christians saying your going to hell if you don't believe in Jesus, seperation in families because of diffrent religous philosophies, and and people killing or enslaving other people in the name of what ever god is popular these days.

This sage academic glows with happiness describing the myths and stories that he studied and analyzed for years. The mythosphere comes to life through his utterance. The links among all cultures are revealed. He was a true teacher in the most profound sense of the word.

Bill Moyers too has inspired and uplifted thousands if not millions with his journalistic commitment. He has been unwavering in his views that the world can be made a better place through tolerance and open-mindedness. These two shining guides introduced the Western world to folktales and myths in a way that has spawned a revolution in psychology, self-help and academic study.

In this popular series they manage to keep the simplification in which these stories are presented from being too ""dumbed down"". Not an easy task. Unfortunately the proliferation of the sentiment ""Follow Your Bliss"" on bumper stickers, Hallmark cards etc. shows the usual tendency for popular culture to take important thoughts out of context and bastardize them. Campbell didn't mean, ""Do whatever you want if it excites you."" On the contrary, he was asking people to look within themselves and go beyond the shallow, material, greed mind to find their true selves; to transcend the commercialized world. Less of the Star Wars/Lucas tie in would be in order but that is a small complaint.

Today's generation of 'young people' is so misguided it makes me ashamed that I'm 21 myself.

Anyway, just wanted to vocalize my frustrations. For the record, the DVD is mind blowing to say the least. I've read nearly everything J.C.(and the other great 20th century mind...Jung) has ever written. I even read the transcript of this interview before watching the DVDs.

668941,5,6303503381,"... it can inspire you, even change your life. It changed mine. I was always confused about religions, myths, spiritualism, and even life, and the inspiration found by this series helped me to better find myself and my place in the world. Campbell had a truly rare understanding of myth, the unconscious self, and spiritual existence I think. Watching this series for the first time, his words were like hammers pounding upon my brain with simple, easy truths that I think I've always known deep inside, but hadn't realized through all the complex and demanding materialism of the adult world. This is it. This is life. The adventure. You can be the ""hero"" of the adventure, or the dragon which plagues your world. (So to speak, of course the ""dragon"" tends to represent the threat of the ego (in the western world.)
Keep in mind, I am totally bias towards Campbell. He was the only person in my life who ever really moved me, and changed my life. Looking at this material objectively, I can say that it deals with our perceptions of life, of how the old stories speak to us of wisdom, if we can open our ears, so to speak. Myth is a beautiful but mystical thing. One can hear the words and receive the example, or even get the point, and miss the inspiration. Language is after all just a vessel to get across an idea (cargo.) We so often focus on the vessel and miss the cargo. Myth carries with it a fantastic yet simple vessel, but without getting the cargo one could never take in its purpose. By that I mean to say that if you do not have an open dock (open mind), then stay clear of this vessel. (It's too big for you.)
WHAT IS IT?
This is a series of talks, a casual interview between Bill Moyers and Professor Joseph Campbell. It was filmed (in part) by George Lucas' studio, and some interviews were conducted in Lucas' home. The talks are about the origins and intentions of myth, their value to us, and myths of our world today -- mainly ""Star Wars"". Ancient myths are the biggest topic however, and these range from Japanese to Native American to Egyptian to Greek to Mayan myths, and more. The topics here -- birth, life, danger, adulthood, loss, death -- could be overwhelming, but Campbell has a genius for simplifying it for those of us who haven't studied mythology all are lives can understand. Part of the reason for that is that Campbell truly gets what he says, and so he doesn't require arrogance or manipulation to move us. He speaks the revealed, skinless truth about who we are, how we live, and how we should live -- according to myth, and just basic wisdom.
Ultimately ""The Power of Myth"" is about wisdom, and believe me, it can help you to find your natural path in life. There are no answers here however -- as Campbell says: ""A teacher can only serve as a lighthouse, and say ""Careful, rocks over here.'""
This DVD set also features an interview with George Lucas, biographies of both Campbell and Moyers, weblinks, and a 'selected videography'. A collection that in my opinion everyone should have.",1098748800,25,3029,4.539305301645339
668942,5,6303503381,"Follow Your Bliss! ~Joseph Campbell (1904-1987)

Joseph Campbell's mind is beyond fascinating. As you view Bill Moyers trying to understand the absolute intellectual bliss Joseph Campbell is engaged in, you can't help but wonder how anyone could maintain the wealth of knowledge swirling in ecstasy in their mind. Joseph Campbell fits each piece of information into a richly woven spiritual tapestry.

Suddenly life becomes much more simple when the universe is explained in a myth. We all see the similarities of the Hero's Adventure in books and movies, but why is this such a prevalent theme and are we all taking this journey? Joseph Campbell believes we are on our own spiritual journeys in which our consciousness is transformed through trials. If life seems like a struggle to you, then the first section about the Hero's Adventure will explain why we must slay our dragons by overcoming fear and other primal inclinations.

Myths can be clues to spirituality and in all cultures, stories of creation and death encourage an understanding of our beginning and end. But are we really ever in any state other than Eternity itself? Joseph Campbell explains why good and evil are temporal apparitions and explores living life as a poem.

During the taping of these interviews, Joseph Campbell had just purchased a computer and has some interesting observations about his interactions.

In this six-part, six-hour interview style journey, you will learn about the yin/yang symbol, why people sacrifice their ego in marriage, why love is the perfect kindness and how libido can be an impulse to life itself.

Other topics of interest: Star Wars, The Holy Grail, Romantic Love, Nirvana, Inner Mythology, the Virgin Birth, Agricultural Societies and the Goddess, Biblical Complexities, Spiritual Rebirth, Rituals as enactments of myths, the Soul as a Circle, Archetypes, Insight into the Human Psyche, Deep Mystery, Chakras, Mysteries of Creation, Compassion, James Joyce and Epiphanies, Monsters and Dragons, Poetry, Heaven and explanations of Brahma.

If you have any interest in World Religions, this will take you to new levels in your understanding of universal desires, our search for a relationship with God and this may even help you understand your relationship with your life partner. Essential viewing for anyone interested in Myths, Buddhism or Christianity.

When you think that this was recorded two years before Joseph Campbell's death, you cannot help but be amazed at the fluidity of his mind and the way in which he weaves concepts into eternal verbal bliss. He not only explains spiritual concepts, he takes you through amazing myths from Japanese, Native American, Egyptian and Mayan cultures. While he speaks, they present beautiful artwork illustrating the stories. He explains the difference between Amore, Eros and Agape and then explains how we can reach Nirvana by reaching a psychological place where we are unattached to desire and fear.

At times Moyers seems to play with words as well as Joseph Campbell, but then at other times he seems to be asking for more information so the viewer can enjoy the depth of knowledge only an extremely perceptive interviewer could extract. At times he reads myths from one culture and Joseph reads them from another culture. The similarities are astonishing.

The Hero's Adventure
The Message of the Myth
The First Storytellers

Bonus Features: An Art Gallery and Selections from the video Sukhavati. Joseph Campbell narrates beautiful nature scenes. I found my six hour experience to be intellectually exhilarating. Half the fun of life is finding all the puzzle pieces needed to explain your very existence. This DVD set takes you beyond a basic understanding of mythology, it literally presents a pathway you could follow to spiritual bliss. I watched both DVDs in one day and was completely captivated by this intellectual tapestry.

668943,2,6303503381,"We watched ""The Power of Myth"" movie in my English class. It was an interview of Joseph Campbell. I did not really close attention to every word that he was saying. I am the type of person that has to have a background of everything that is given to her, a way that you can prove what you say. Myths are the exact opposite. It makes you wonder, yes I do like to wonder, but you need that sense of truth to everything.

He talks about the characteristics of a hero, and what a hero really is. We are learning about the hero's journey in class, which I think is very interesting. We can put that with everyday life. You can relate it to movies, and also books. I really like this part about the whole myth thing.

The movie exactly did not intrigue me much. It was actually kind of boring. I get more out of a discussion that we are involved in. There are some good things about movies, but not extremely long ones that make you want to go to sleep.

Myths are very interesting, but on the flip side they are kind of pointless. You have story that can be used to entertain, but when you need a true story, there is not a myth that is full of truth. It has been pasted down from generations to generations and as time has pasted, things have been added to it as well as taken away from it. Just like that telephone game. You never end up with what you started of with.

Myths are good altogether, but only for entertainment. Thomas Campbell is a well known man for his myths and writings. It is up to us whether we want to believe him or not and take the time to understand the way he is explaining myths.",1098230400,2,1602,4.141479099678457
668944,3,6303503381,"In my English class, we watched and noted Joseph Campbell's, ""The Power of myth"". I found it very inspiring but on the same note, I found myself fighting the urge to fall asleep. (I must not have put up a real good fight) I feel that more should have been done to make the video less challenging intellectually for younger audiences. (Yet at the time, I don't believe they figured students of our age would be watching this video) The video was so complex that it was challenging just to comprehend what he was saying. Though this is true, I was able to gather some important information from what he was saying.

In the video, Campbell told of some of the traits of a hero, some examples of stores told throughout history, as well as a new myth he was working on. I found the new myth he had planned to be very interesting. I had no clue that anyone in these modern day times was capable of creating a myth, or even had the interest.

I, too, am very fascinated with mythological stories. What amazes me most about them is how so many different cultures throughout the world, which had no relation to the other, managed to create stories so much alike. For example, the story of Noah and the flood, along with the creation of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, are found in the Old Testament of the Bible. Versions of these two stories, along with many others are found in mythology of other cultures throughout the world. Along with the idea of different cultures creating stories of their own, many cultures copied each other in their mythological accounts.

Campbell devoted his life to discovering and researching world-wide myths. He once said, ""It's important to live life knowing its mystery."" I agree with that statement. Life, like mythology, is full of events which cannot be explained rationally.",1098144000,5,1809,4.611801242236025
668945,4,6303503381,"""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"" was an amazing and thought-provoking video that I thoroughly enjoyed. Although most of my peers might look on Mr. Campbell's words with a certain amount of disdain, I was positively rivetted by his impressive grasp of human nature, and the way it shows up throughout the stories we tell. Being a devoted Star Wars fan, I especially enjoyed the clips and discussion on George Lucas's original trilogy. It's truly amazing how we, as humans, place characters in stories we tell that fulfill the needs of the main character or hero. Even more astounding, however, is how we ourselves look for these archetypes in our fellow humans to fulfill our own needs.

For example, Luke Skywalker, the hero of the Star Wars trilogy, is surrounded by people who not only fit Joseph Campbell's archetypes, but also fulfill many of Luke's emotional and psychological needs. Ben Kenobi, the wise old Jedi that Luke accompanies to Alderaan, serves as Luke's source of wisdom and knowledge about things bigger than himself. Han Solo, the mercenary-turned hero of the trilogy, serves Luke as a friend and ally, offering encouragement and optimism to both Luke and Leia, a heroine of sorts, in times where there is little reason to be encouraged or optimistic.

However, the Star Wars reference were not the only reason I enjoyed this movie. Joseph Campbell managed to explain the entire struggle of human beings and our existence in so few words, and using only one archetype. The midieval dragon archetype, a fearsome creature who hoards treasure and beauty away from sheer greed, is a symbol of the way many human beings operate. In some people, they limit themselves because they are afraid, or uncertain, or insecure. They keep themselves from the bounty and opportunities life has to offer, and in that sense, they become their own inner dragon. However, when you refuse to allow your insecurities to keep you from your dreams and goals, you slay the dragon, and reap the rewards of your quest.

All in all, I learned much from Joseph Campbell in the brief time it took to watch ""Power of Myth."" My knowledge, however, does not only extend to myths, but beyond stories to life itself, and how understanding why we tell the stories we tell is so important.",1098144000,6,2278,4.865979381443299
668946,1,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell thinks about thinking too much that it has become unhealthy. His nonsense ramblings with Bill Moyers damage the young, still functioning, minds of America's youth. Campbell's story telling skills are sketchy and hard to follow. Campbell believes that all myths are part of human's subconscious and that if humans make mistakes they are unaware of what they are doing. Maybe the myths from the past aren't related to the subconscious. Honestly, has anyone ever proved that this hidden mentality exists? We cannot touch, hear, or see this state of mind. Yet, according to Campbell it must be real, it has to be the root of all good and evil in the world. For every error in this world he blames it on some fluke attitude. Wake up Campbell! Its called the subconscious for a reason-its hidden.",1098144000,9,806,4.8478260869565215
668947,3,6303503381,"This past semester in my English class we watched the first segment of ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,"" which changed my life in many ways. At first I thought it would be a boring movie, Of course I know what a hero is, it's someone who saves somebody from a fire in a building right before it blows up, or even killing the ""bad guy"" right before he kills you. But, since I saw the movie my view of a hero was changed dramatically. Joseph Campbell was a well educated man. He believes every myth is related to religion in one way or another. He would use analogies to explain his beliefs. He talked about an assortment of subjects during the course of the movie. He explained the hero's journey. He gave some religious examples of heroes such as Muhammad, Moses and Jesus. He explained the three main religions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Not only did he give religious examples, he talked about modern day shows such as Star Wars. Now that I watched the movie I believe everyone who is living is a hero. When you are born you cross a threshold to the world known as the underworld. There are physical and spiritual heroes. A physical hero could be known as Hercules or someone such as that. A spiritual hero could be known from the bible such as Jesus or Moses. We live in a society where they judge people by there actions which give us our heroes. If everyone would watch this movie and understand they themselves are probably a hero to someone else might take a second look on things and understand the meaning of living. I enjoyed this interview and would recommend it to everybody.",1098144000,,1604,4.477815699658703
668948,3,6303503381,"In my 10th grade Honors English Class, we watched ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of the Myth,"" Joseph Campbell is interviewed and talks about heroes in Mythology. Some of the points he made really changed the way I viewed things, and gave me a great comparison on heroes and real life.

First, he believes everything begins with a story. This really made sense to me because I feel that everything has to start from somewhere. It makes the most sense to start something with a story. Next, a hero has a moral objective. Her objective is saving people, a person, or an idea. She usually sacrifices herself for something. I think being a true hero is sacrificing your self for something. What could be more fulfilling that giving up your life to save something?

Joseph Campbell says that all heroes in myths deal with the transformation of consciousness and the hero is transformed by trials. Heroes definitely go through some transformation in their adventures. Of course, they have to be challenged, so they go through trials. In these trials they have physical and spiritual duties. Their physical duty would be to save someone or something. Their spiritual duty would be to win or to find superhuman feeling of being a hero and then sharing it with people. It makes perfectly good sense that they have physical and spiritual duties.

The main point that Campbell made that stuck out at me was that of Jesus and his temptations. He had three temptations. The first being he was asked to turn rock to bread. The second was when he was tempted to give up his soul to the devil to gain power of the world. The last one was when he was placed on top of Hera's temple, and told to get down. In my opinion, Jesus is definitely the world's greatest hero. Heroes have to go through temptations to test their faith in whatever it is they believe. Jesus was the master at keeping His faith. So this made me realize that a true hero never gives up, even when times are the worst.

These points really changed the way I viewed heroes. Before, I thought they were just a brave person who did good deeds. Now I realize that there is a pattern that heroes follow. Although these patterns about heroes were founded a long time ago, they still can be applied to modern day heroes. And now, I have help picking out who I truly believe is a hero.",1098144000,,2329,4.538095238095238
669038,4,6303503381,"Recently we watched the film ""The Power of Myth"" in my English 230 class because we are studying archetypes. We watched the first segment, and I was amazed to discover Joseph Campbell's outlook on human interaction. I see Joseph Campbell as an extremely intelligent and well-educated man. He explained that almost all myths are related to religion somehow. Christ, Moses, Muhammed, and other religious figures can be described as heroes. The three major religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, are also relevant to mythology because in a broad outlook, they tell the same story and share the same morals. Joseph Campbell described dreams as symbolic realizations. You may realize something that is important and you discover it symbolically in a dream.  I found very interesting his theories of the human conscious and unconscious. Campbell explains that we are the consciousness of earth. He described a human's conscious as what you are aware of. His example was a vine growing up a tree. As soon as the leaves grow off of the vine, they immediately turn towards the sun. This is because the leaves are conscious of the sun. Joseph Campbell thinks of the brain as a secondary organ because it blocks us from knowing what we could truly know. He says that the human conscious takes over and we have no control. Consciousness occurs on different levels. As you go to and from places, your conscious goes to higher or lower platforms. Bill Moyers, the interviewer, asked Joseph Campbell about peace and Nirvana. Joseph Campbell explained that a human's peace is inside himself. The person has to discover it and free himself from fear, because Nirvana is defined as a state when you are no longer compelled by fear. Joseph Campbell's views on a human's conscious have really changed my outlook on the subject. I do not completely understand or agree with all of his theories, but I believe these ideas are relevant to the understanding of human interaction. Joseph Campbell is not only very intelligent but he ""thinks outside the box"" as I see it.",1098144000,4,2051,4.944927536231884
669039,2,6303503381,"In my sophomore English class, we watched the movie ""The Power of the Myth"" where Bill Moyers interview Joseph Campbell. Joseph Campbell is known as one of the chief authorities of myths, archetypes, and heroes.

Before I saw this movie, I was under the impression a hero was just someone who was a ""good guy,"" such as well known heroes Superman, Spiderman, Batman, etc. I learned that heroes have certain characteristics. They follow a certain journey, and don't have to be make-believe.

Moses was the hero figure in the story of the 10 commandments. Buddha and Jesus' stories closely resemble each other in the hero's journey. Both of them had 3 temptations they must have overcome to ""win"" in the end.

Many people believe that you must have an admiration for a hero- to look up to them and wish you were like them. Truthfully, in more instances than not, you end up feeling pity for the hero. The hero starts a journey for a reason, he's not just going ""along for the ride."" Oftentimes he seems as if he cannot finish the journey. This is called a ""Belly of the Whale"" situation. Other examples are Hercules and going into the underworld, or the characters on Star Wars being trapped in the garbage disposal.

Star Wars is the quintessence of hero and character archetypes. George Lucas, the creator, literally followed Joseph Campbell's writings when he sat down and wrote the script for this movie.

Campbell has opened my eyes as to what a true hero is and how to distinctly find one within a story. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in mythology or just wants to know how to find a ""true"" hero.",1098144000,5,1626,4.631944444444445
669040,4,6303503381,"In English class this semester, we recently watched Power of Myth. It had Joseph Campbell being interviewed. Before I watched this video I thought a hero was a person that rescued somebody or did something tremendous in their life, but I realized that we ourselves are heroes. Campbell used Moses as an example of a hero. Moses was to go get the rules (the ten commandments) for the new society. In this case, a hero has three parts: departure, fulfillment, and return. It doesn't take something huge to make a person a hero. A baby being born is a hero. It leaves the threshold and comes into a new, uncanny world (the underworld). Campbell is a very interesting man, he shows much respect for heroes. Studying about heroes have opened my eyes to a new perspective by showing me that heroes are not always people that are extolled in society, they are your average people. Physical and Spiritual heroes are the two types of heroes. An example of a physical hero is Hercules. His strength is what got him recognized. He had to go through twelve labors to become immortal. His physical strength is what got him through the labors. An example of a spiritual hero is Jesus Christ. In his life he sacrificed himself, went through death, and was resurrected. He is well known by healing, helping, and guiding people through hard times. Because of his amazing influence on the people, he is now worshiped and looked upon to help guide people during tribulations. Jesus was just an ordinary man. He wasn't anybody that was held higher than anybody else. He didn't wear nice clothes, just a robe and sandals. He didn't have a house, he walked around and stayed wherever. It doesn't always take somebody who is bigger, or smarter than everybody else to make a hero. It can simply be the person sitting right beside you.",1098144000,3,1810,4.677115987460815
669041,3,6303503381,"Upon seeing the first movie of a series, Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, I was a bit confused as to how all of this information applies to any situation and story. By using ""smart words"" I think that he confuses the listener, he uses examples like Moses and Buddha. Who the reader, never fully interpreting the life of these people, might be confused as to the situation, as was I. Although, examples being unclear, the archetypes and roles of the characters was well understood.

Campbell uses examples such as the characters in the popular 1970's movie, Star Wars. He notes that the characters of all have typical archetypes. The character of Luke Skywalker was the hero; Obi Wan Kanobi and Yoda were the mentors, Princess Leia was the damsel in distress, etc. Luke Skywalker had to complete challenges and adventures to move on to the next level. The hero has to complete the trials before stepping into a different, harder level (which, by the way, is always suited to the needs of the hero, always adjusting, and changing to fit the level of the hero). The movie tells about the how the hero's life can be diagramed and compared to so many other stories with typical plots. Campbell goes on to explain the characteristics of the hero's journey. For example, a hero might make sacrifices and sometimes even risk ""the ultimate sacrifice"" (their life), make a transition from child to adulthood, and sometimes is even forced into hero-hood.

Joseph Campbell and The Power of Myth has helped many to understand more into the world of mythology and a hero's adventure. By explaining each step in detail, he has provided a more vivid way of looking into stories. Gathering knowledge from this video is a delight and also a curse, you will find yourself predicting movies more and more often. Beware!",1098144000,2,1805,4.782051282051282
669042,5,6303503381,"This year in my English 230 class we have been studying archetypes and mythology. Our teacher brought in an interview with Joseph Campbell entitled, The Power of Myth and we watched it. The movie talks a lot about Joseph Campbell in the beginning. He says later on in the interview that his hero is Douglas Fairbanks. When most people think of a hero they think of somebody who has some super power. Most children think Superman, Batman, and many other characters to be heroes. Campbell points out in the interview that all a person has to do to become a hero, is to follow the hero's journey. Joseph Campbell gave many examples of the hero's journey. Moses, the man who led the Jews out of Egypt, and the Star Wars movies are some of the few great examples. Up until now, I have thought of heroes to be people who have don't something great or has some special power or talent. After watching this movie I realized that every one of us are heroes. A baby being born is a hero. When it is born it crosses the threshold into a new world, also known as the underworld. Heroes are your everyday citizens, not just people who are always extolled in society. There are two types of heroes, Physical and Spiritual. An example of a Physical hero is Hercules. He had to use his strength to be recognized. Going through the 12 Labors, Hercules had to use his strength to finish the labors. An example of a Spiritual type of hero is Jesus Christ. During his life, he sacrificed himself, died, and was resurrected. Jesus was a normal man, who is now known for guiding and helping people through hard times. Don't always think of a hero as someone who has done something great. There are heroes all around us in society but nobody realizes it. This movie really changed what I think a true hero is. I think it was very helpful and I would recommend people to see it.",1098144000,,1854,4.439882697947214
669043,5,6303503381,"This year in my English class we began to talk about the journey of a hero and how it can be seen in many different movies, books, myths, and real life. Our teacher decided to show us a video with Joseph Campbell in it being interviewed about heros and the journey they take to become one.  While being interviewed Mr. Campbell keeps on giving examples and different views on a hero.  That really showed that he was a very knowledgeable man on this subject.

Before watching this video my image of a hero was someone like Spiderman, Superman, or someone with supernatural powers.  Joseph Campbell said that heros are people who do something more than what is expected and that is why they are worth writing about.  He says there are spiritual heros and physical heros.  All you have to do is go through the journey that a hero takes.  He really makes this clear when he relates it to my life saying that everyone is a hero in birth.  You cross a threshold when you are born and come into a new unfamiliar world.

Mr. Campbell goes on to relate a heros journey to us when he relates hero's trials to our life through religion.  When you loose yourself or give yourself to another is a trial.  Tests are just illuminating revelations.  This goes on to poove that anyone can be or is a hero if you look at parts of his life.

 Joseph Campbell is a very intelligent man who has changed my views on heros.  Now I know a hero is not just someone like Superman but much more.  Campbell made me realize that there are many different types of heros in our world which he does through many great examples.  Before seeing Mr. Campbell's interview about heros and their journey I was very narrow minded.  Now that he has made the hero's journey clear to me in stating what a hero is I can go on to have a better understanding of this subject.",1098144000,,1830,4.363905325443787
669044,4,6303503381,"This year, In my tenth grade English class, our teacher gave us the privalege of watching a documentary video on Joseph Campbell- A hero's Journey. My teacher realixed that this video would be very enriching to us because it directly associated with the part of mythology that we were studying.

I can claim that this video showed and explained to me how the human mind organizes things in society without realizing it because it gave supporting explanations for every claim that the movie made. An example of this was when the video showed us how we build certain buldings according to the job and authority that the structure will have. They supported this claim by giving us examples of many buildings throughout the world that are sized according to there importance among people.

I would normally not have noticed things such as this because i believed that everything we do has a logical reason that we think about. I now realize that this was a very stubborn way of seeing the human drive to do things.

Individuals that are not open minded, might watch this video and make the hasty conclution that things on the video show episodes of  luck. These people do not realize that there are too many examples of movies that use the hero's journey for their plot. Star wars was one of the movies chosen to examine in this video and I believe this was very appropriate because they showed all aspects that there were to find throughout the movie.

All together, this video can be analyzed in many different ways. This movie has led me to believe that all humans subconciously think the same and create enriching things based partially on instincts.",1098144000,2,1650,4.735191637630662
669045,3,6303503381,"In the interview with journalist Bill Moyers at Skywalker Ranch, mythologist Joseph Campbell discusses the significance of mythology.  ""The Power of Myth"" has a lot of remarkable information about mythology.  He talks about many parts of mythology and describes many myths and how they follow the hero's journey.  The discussion about Hero with a Thousand Faces, a book that traces the hero's journey, was an interesting part of this movie.  Joseph Campbell truly knows his mythology and has an extremely great sense of knowledge.  I have to say that anyone who could study mythology to a very high level such as Joseph Campbell did has to be very intelligent.  He surrounded his whole life with his study of mythology.  He has also become very popular and many people love his work.

  Also, Joseph Campbell talks about how dreams and myths come from the same place.  If you think about it, dreams and myths are pretty much the same ideas.  They are both put together in the mind and most of them are very unrealistic.  There are also a few differences though like the fact that myths are explanations for something in nature.  Joseph Campbell was truly a brilliant man as he wanted everyone to enjoy the works of mythology.  Many people have viewed mythology as it was used in Star Wars.  George Lucas got some help from Joseph Campbell in the creation of this film.  Mythology is a very common study among many people today.  Although many myths are supposed to be an explanation, many are confusing.  I can understand how many people could get confused by watching ""The Power of Myth."" I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who isn't really interested in mythology and understanding its purpose.",1098144000,,1703,4.83044982698962
669046,4,6303503381,"Although I had previously learned about the mono-myth process and the different aspects of the myths found throughout history, I found this video to be an insightful tool towards gaining more knowledge.  Knowing the archetypes, and the hero in particular, references were made easier to be understood after watching this film.  After Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, I saw the many connections I could draw from the movie to my own life.  The analogies and real life situations Joseph Campbell gave in his explanation of heroes showed me that a person doesn't have to do something spectacular to be a hero.

  Through something as simple as the development of a child, the hero's journey was clearly illustrated.  While it is still an embryo in the mother's womb, the fetus undergoes many struggles.  The final trial and ""crossing of the threshold"" occurs at the birth.

  During the interview Campbell gave other examples of the hero's journey. One example is Moses, the man who led the Jews out of Egypt. The departure could be when he goes to the top of the mountain and receives the Ten Commandments. The act of receiving the commands is the fulfillment of his journey and when he descends from the mountain it is the return. Another example of the hero's journey is Jesus' life, which fits nearly all of the characteristics of the hero archetype. He was born of a virgin mother, went through temptations and was crucified and resurrected on the third day. Star Wars movies are also a perfect example of the cycle of the hero's journey.

  The samples of the hero's journey given throughout the film have been a breakthrough in my understanding of the hero archetype and the importance of the journey.  Without the hero's journey, myths would be unable to be followed or understood.  We can see the hero's journey as it happens in all of our lives, and that is what makes this film substantial.",1098144000,,1904,4.776758409785932
669047,4,6303503381,"This year in my English class, we did studies on heroes and mythology and to finish the section up, we watched the video about Joseph Campbell. This video was very outstanding. It really inspired me in very many ways. Campbell was a very intellectual man.

Joseph Campbell has changed my views about myself and has shaped me into a better person in a lot of ways. In the video, it gives some examples of his work. The segment about war has an impact on me. It shows that I need to fight more for what I believe in, and that if I'm against something, I shouldn't keep it to myself. I believe that was the segment of the video that affected me the most.

I will admit, I'm not exactly a big fan of Star Wars, however, the part that I watched really made me think hard about it. When Luke Skywalker was driving the airplane thing, a voice game that said, ""Use the force, Luke."" Those words may be corny, but they were very inspirational. The video showed me that I should have a need for spiritual adventure. I shouldn't go along for the ride. I need to have a purpose and I believe that this has truely affected the way I think about life.

This video was a great inspiration to me. Campbell showed me a better, more optimistic way to look at my life. It gives me a different perspective to life.",1098144000,2,1294,4.273469387755102
669145,3,6303503381,"In my Language Arts class, we watched a Joseph Campbell video.  This video was based on the numerous parts of a hero's journey, as well as a variety of ideas on mythology.  Campbell stretched out reasoning and ideas to go beyond what people would normally think.  He believes that there is different hero's in life.  There are physical heroes, spiritual heroes, and people who are thrown into being a hero, such as a solider.  One spiritual hero he talks about is Muhammad. Muhammad created the Koran, and he often left home to meditate.

Joseph Campbell tells us that there are three parts to a hero's journey: the departure, fulfillment, and the return.  An example that Campbell gives us is Moses, when he receives the Ten Commandments. He departs from the city up to Mount Sinai, he receives (fulfillment) the Ten Commandments, and he travels back down the mountain with the commandments (return).  Along with the journey, the hero faces three temptations: economic, political, and spiritual.

Joseph Campbell brings up the movie Star Wars when he starts talking about archetypes.  He says that Star Wars is a new realm for the imagination.  The old man in the movie is the advisor, who trains Luke; Harrison Ford plays the mercenary solo.  Luke Skywalker is the hero in this movie. The scene where they are all stuck in the trash compacter is a belly of the whale experience.

Campbell has a different outlook on life than most people.  He thinks that heroes evolve as culture evolves.  He also considers are collective unconscious to be one of the most important items that we obtain.  He says that a hero is found in each one of us, and that the real dragon that is within us is our ego. In general, Campbell is unlike many people in the way that he thinks and comprehends things.",1098144000,3,1787,4.716129032258064
669146,3,6303503381,"In my high school sophomore English class, we watched ""The Hero's Adventure"".  In the video, Bill Moyers interviewed Joseph Campbell about his opinion of mythology.  Campbell is considered the ""father of mythology"" and wrote twenty different books on the subject.  He died in 1987.

  One of the first things that they talked about in the movie was that there are two types of deeds a hero can perform.  One type is the physical deed such as a war act or a sacrifice.  The other type is a spiritual deed.  This is when the hero goes on the adventure learns a new piece of knowledge and returns to communicate it to the people.  Whatever the deed, the hero always saves something whether it is a person or his sanity.

  During the interview they also gave examples of a hero's journey.  One such example is Moses.  Moses led the people out of Egypt.  The departure could be when he goes to the top of the mountain and receives the Ten Commandments.  The act of receiving the commands is the fulfillment of his journey and when he descends from the mountain is the return.  Another example of a hero's journey is Jesus' life.  He was born of a virgin mother; he went through temptations and was crucified and resurrected on the third day.  Star Wars movies are also a perfect example of the cycle of the hero's journey.

  All myths deal with the transformation of consciousness.  The transformation takes place when the hero goes through trial and temptations.  All hero's also undergo the ""belly of the whale"" experience.  This is also called ""crossing the threshold.""  The hero must pass from the safety of the traditional world into a world of the unknown.  After they complete this step they have to complete some tests so that they can get the reward.

  The movie was very informative, but I thought that it was uninteresting.  I think that it would have been better if it was not just an interview.  If they went to different places that had a significance in mythology, it would have made it more enjoyable to watch.  I would recommend this movie to someone who wanted to know more about Campbell and different parts of a hero's journey.

It was documentary/educational exploration of the myths of many cultures.  Mythology is humanity's universal method of seeking the transcendental, and ""follow your bliss"" is the timeless formula for spiritual satisfaction. Campbell himself is the embodiment of these themes, an erudite scholar and quintessential storyteller, recalling a wide spectrum of myths from throughout history (Japanese, Native American, Egyptian, Mayan, and many more) to illustrate humankind's eternal quest to grasp the mysteries of creation. Historical artifacts and illustrations bring these timeless stories to life.  Bill Moyers is an excellent, skillful interviewer.  I own the DVD and have purchase it for family members, so they may experience new thoughts, new ideas, and also the incredible art of interviewing.

669150,5,6303503381,"In this brilliant series of interviews (vividly illustrated by film footage of rituals and artwork from the world over), Joseph Campbell invites us to transcend ordinary activities motivated by fear, greed, and societal constraints in favor of more heartfelt modes of being and thinking that connect us with the divine, by which he means the awe and mystery of the universe.  He has the prodigious breadth of knowledge to see universal themes where many see only bizarre cultural differences.  He discusses what the cave paintings at Lascaux have in common with Chartres cathedral, why the paintings of Picasso and Klee, and the writings of Joyce and Mann, serve the same role in society as the rituals of Native Americans and Australian Aborigines, and how western society has become largely estranged from nature and thereby from authentic culture, mythology, and ritual.  His central point is that all genuine myths lead us to an understanding of the divine; that the divine is perhaps best defined as the experience available to each one of us of the sheer rapture and existence; and that each moment of consciousness is also an experience of eternity.  He doesn't pretend to have all the answers, but he asks the profound questions about human nature and the universe, and discusses them as intelligently as anyone I've ever encountered.",1087430400,4,1342,5.086363636363636

Campbell's encyclopedic knowledge of the subject is a marvel and Moyers does a decent job asking the layman's question.  This series deepened my understanding of many facets of religion and gave me so much inspiration for more study, I could spend a life time following those leads.

Truly Joseph Campbell is a symbol for modern mythology and a rolemodel for transcendent philosophers. Mr. Campbell's messages in these series however, are not an outline of his methodology, nor are they recapitulations of his work. He just talks about myths and sets an example of how one would have to view them in order to understand something like the cosmogenic circle.

669153,2,6303503381,"The interview of Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyer leaves the viewer feeling lost and unfulfilled. Wrought with terminology and an overabundance of information, the audience detaches themselves from moment to moment to decipher and digest all that
Campbell has to say. As one sitting in an advanced foreign language class with not a clue of how to say hello, Campbell falls short of relating to his audience. A teacher must be able to draw in her students and express in terms that they can understand. Although gifted and intelligent, Mr. Campbell lacks the important characteristic of interpretation. What good is knowledge if the person cannot share it?
  In the interview, many heroes are discussed. From the current day Luke Skywalker down to the biblical character of Moses, Campbell ties centuries of beings together with his theoretical hero's life journey. It makes sense in the simplicity but there is nothing simple about Mr. Campbell or his thoughts. The journey of Moses leads him through a trip to
Mt. Sinai where he is given the Ten Commandments and returns to his people to fmd them worshipping idols. This is typical of the hero's journey in that it is an example of the highs and lows associated with being a hero.
Some heroes are born to be heroes while some are forced into heroism by unforeseen events. September 11th comes into my mind. I believe that Mr. Campbell would express the heroes of this event as those people who were not necessarily chosen, but rose to the occasion without thought, to fulfill their life journey by saving others and giving the ultimate sacrifice.
  It is difficult to be critical of a man who is so exceptionally intelligent and thoughtful; however, I must stand by the premise that in order to teach the world the importance of heroes or any subject, one must have the ability to articulate one's erudition to others.
  Expression is also a gift and unfortunately, one that Mr. Campbell was not amply given. One should not have to be a scholar to grasp the concepts of the hero's life journey.",1078185600,,2042,4.82

Joseph Campbell does an excellent job of telling stories and myths from all over the world. He is very educated in myths from all different cultures. One myth that stood out to me was the one about the Native American princess who fell in love with a man from another tribe. She went to visit the man's family in their village. During her stay with the family, she found out the man she was to marry was a magician. Her soon to be husband went out every morning to hunt. While he was gone a serpent would come and try to scare her. Then would leave and a few minutes later her fianc&eacute;e would come home and ask her, ""Honey did I scare you when I was a snake?"" The young girl was frightened by the man and wanted to run away and go back home to her own village. She lost her way in the woods and a kind, old man appeared and told her that the man and his brothers had their hearts stolen and if she found them and released them, then the curse would be taken away and they would not turn into serpents again.
 Joseph Campbell also did a great job in telling the stories so one might be able to even mental visualize the story he is telling.

He gives us his insights on mythology and digs deep into it's meanings. The interview takes place in California on the set of Skywalker Ranch, owned by George Lucas. I have never been that interested in mythology or mythological stories, but this video has showed me that mythology is actually relates to many things in my everyday life. I am a Christian and Campbell uses Christ as an example of a Spiritual hero. Buddha and Moses were other examples. They all three followed the specific pattern shown in mythology. Star War movies are linked back to the world's oldest mythological records. This is why the interview was held on the set of the Skywalker Ranch. I really liked how the video gave examples of Star War movies being myths. I have never saw any Star War movies before. I would have never thought about Star Wars being a myth though, but Campbell explains to us that by Luke Skywalker being a hero, it is. Skywalker was called to action, went through many test, and then rewarded. Those are the characteristics of a hero. The modern movie examples that Campbell used made mythology in present time easier for me to understand. Star Wars wasn't the only example he used, he also linked cultures together through their mythology. Two things that I didn't know before watching this video is that many myths are the same all over the world and they do not change over time. Overall, I surprisingly enjoyed this video. It was boring at some points, but very informative to me. I would recommend for you to watch this video, especially if you are very interested in mythology.

669310,1,6303503381,"While I'm not nearly as interested in the fantastical fabrications of ancient civilizations as I am with the actual physical exploits of those cultures, I do find it fascinating how a society's myths can so accurately reflect its political and social feats, and yet also contain within them completely unprecedented ideas.  An idea similar to this was expressed by the well-known historian Joseph Campbell in ""Joseph Campbell: The Power of Myth,"" or as I like to call it, the ""2004 Film Borefest Selection of the Week.""  My less-than-intelligent pun will be addressed later in the review.
 To get back on track, the first volume of an extensive video collection of Bill Moyers' interviews with Campbell addressed the uniformity of myths around the world; that is, an identification of a central theme or idea in the various mythical stories found throughout the world's cultures.  While there are many such themes, Campbell obviously feels that the most vital of all these is the idea of a hero's journey.  Having observed this idea in several seemingly unrelated tales, Campbell has identified certain characteristics found in most of these legends and organized them into separate ascending steps, each of which the hero will probably go through.  Among these are a hero's rite of passage, a quest placed upon him (or her), and a gracious reward.  Campbell cites examples to further stress his point, but he insults the viewer's intelligence by shamelessly using the simplest and most popular references possible (Star Wars), even if there are others that would emphasize this idea more accurately (any of the great Greek myths, or even Shakespeare).
 Although Campbell makes a viable and intelligent argument, the futile attempts to lure the already bored audience through overused Star Wars clips are immediately counteracted by Moyers' dull questions and Campbell's even-duller answers.  Not to say, of course, that Campbell isn't passionate about what he does; on the contrary, he seemed as giddy as a young Luke Skywalker to lap up the answers to Moyers' generic inquiries.
 However, as boring as the interview was, I was still somewhat interested by the history that was being explored.  New concepts regarding ancient myth were being revealed to me, and the unexplained uniformity of various legends was intriguing.
 But then I noticed that there was still one issue that wasn't being addressed: why?
 Campbell seemed as if he could talk for hours about how most myths follow the same heroic pattern, but not once did I hear him even attempt to explain why such a phenomenon occurred.
 Now I'm all for a good psychological thriller leaving me hanging, wondering what really happened.
 But can you do that with history?",1077580800,13,2727,5.11036036036036

The movie The Power of Myth gave many examples of how myths and innuendoes are used in everyday movies likes that of Star Wars and many more. While this movie for the most part was very good, it did have its moments of boredom. It seemed as if it just rambled on and on about no particular subject for a while. The questions that Bill Moyer was asking the Joseph Campbell in the beginning were rather vague. In doing this it allowed him to answer the questions more openly. Closer toward the end of the video it started showing more clips and examples of how myths are used in movies. Campbell somehow finds many connections between certain cultures regarding mythology. He shows how many myths around the world are the same.

669312,3,6303503381,"In The Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure the show's host, Bill Moyers, interviews Joseph Campbell in Northern California on the set of George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch.  Campbell is considered to be the mastermind of modern mythology.  The way he expresses mythology just touches my heart with passion.
The interview is conducted at Skywalker Ranch because of one of the main themes of this movie, which is how George Lucas' Star Wars movies can link to some of the world's oldest mythological accounts.  The movie shows many clips from some of the best Star Wars movies.  These clips give us examples of the ideas of mythology used to make the Star Wars movies. Campbell does a good job of showing how the myths he told about in the interview relate to the Star Wars Clips.
In the movie, Campbell shows how many religions are very similar.  He talks about how Jesus, Moses, Jonah (when he is inside of the whale), and Buddha are very similar because they are all people that have to be proven as heroes through a number of events or tests.  He does a good job on the explanation of how religions can be very alike.
The movie is very informative in the educational values of mythology.  It shows how Joseph Campbell does very well in knowing and helping others in trying to learn about the key points of mythology.  Campbell sounds like he is a man of great knowledge of the mythological perspectives of life.
Over all, the movie seems to be very informative, but boring. It is very repetitive in its information. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone if they were just going to watch it for pleasure.

Campbell spoke of how heroes come in different forms and change over time. This is seen in many different works.
  Campbell enlightens his viewers with the patterns he has seen in almost all mythology. This specific pattern is as follows: the departure, fulfillment, and the return to a ""home place."" An example of a spiritual hero that followed this path is Moses. Spiritual heroes show the powers of life and their infliction through man. Other spiritual heroes were Christ and Buddha.
  During his discussion of mythology, Joseph Campbell gives insight on more of his opinions. He shares with viewers that mothers are heroines, well, most of them any ways. Campbell also discusses how the hero evolves as culture evolves. As culture evolves, values change and people view different things as notorious, courageous, etc. He also explains how each achievement is a manifestatiion of his character [hero], and leaves the topic very open-ended. In the interview's entirety, he leaves a majority of topics and answers open-ended to give viewers the change to develop some of their own opinions.
  All in all, this film did not particularly stir my interest. I know that if mythology and heroes intrigued me, I would've been very interested in the film. To anyone who loves mythology, this surely is the film for you. Granted, you don't fall asleep during the video, you will hear many good insights of this brilliant man who has passed away.

669314,2,6303503381,"Although I acknowledge the depth of Mr. Campbell's intellect and expertise, I feel that the interview was difficult to follow and understand. It would have been better had I read the book. There were times that his mumbling made it impossible to decipher his words. When I did audibly connect, Mr. Campbell had much to say, and I applaud his research and opinions. Webster, himself though, could not have followed the immense, superfluity of vocabulary terminology that Campbell emitted from his orifice in a rhythmic precedent that only Einstein could have decoded.
He brings forth the heroes in biblical, mythological, and fictional movie characters. Hercules, Moses, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, and several others were mentioned. The one that interested me the most was his input on the life and death of Jesus Christ. Jesus' heroic journey included several phases of the modeled hero's life journey as describe in detail by Mr. Campbell. Jesus' life included tempting trials three times, performing miracles, and meeting with his Father in the end. These examples were a part of the theory that Mr. Campbell believed and studied.
He intertwines and mixes many religions and focuses on the point that our religions are based on a particular hero of sorts. Heroes have been written and talked about for centuries. Mr. Campbell believes that a hero can be ordinary or extraordinary. That anyone can be a hero even if they are not documented heroes. Heroes can have a journey that they want or choose but also heroes can have a journey that they really don't want to have. A heroine that Mr. Campbell failed to mention was Joan of Arc. In fact I do not believe he mentioned any heroic women and because of this, I take offense. Maybe I should read the books. Surely, a man of Mr. Campbell's intelligence would realize the contribution of female protagonist.

Joseph Campbell, however, showed me in ""The Power of Myth,"" that mythology relates to many of the things that I believe in and live my life by. The story of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ is related to a hero's journey in many myths. Jesus experiences three temptations and comes out on top, like many heroes throughout history's many stories. Most of the movies made today have a main character hero that is called to adventure, goes through many trails, and then is rewarded with treasures, marriage, or immortality. The Star Wars, and their hero Luke Skywalker, are a prime example of this type of journey. This intrigued me, for I had never thought of Star Wars as being a myth. I thought of it as just a ""movie."" Joseph Campbell also explained how the stories from some religions could be compared and found similar. Like I said earlier, Jesus Christ had to go through three trails or temptations. Buddha and Muhammad both did the same. Even normal, everyday people live a life that follow the hero path as told by Joseph Campbell. I found this very interesting. I had always thought of a good person as being a hero, but not in the literal sense of their lifelong journey. It is amazing how someone's life can be written in a story. Even though there were quite a few interesting comments made by Joseph Campbell, I cannot say that I really liked this video. To be quite frank, it was boring. Interviews are not the most interesting videos to watch. This video was, however, very informative and interesting (Just boring in the way that the information was told). Joseph Campbell knows a great deal about myths and that information could be told in a different way to make it ""eye-catching."" Since it was boring though, I can only give it 4 stars.",1077235200,,1819,4.6
669317,1,6303503381,"In the film, ""The Power of Myth"", Bill Moyers questions Joseph Cambell about his beliefs and ideologies of myth.  Mr. Cambell ,having infinite knowledge on the subject, goes very deep in explaining how different myths originate and what they mean and why they were originated. His work inspired George Lucas to write Star Wars.  He also talks about the life cycle of a hero or the ""heroic cycle"".  This is a very important topic considering almost every myth, in some form deals with a hero.
 Joseph Cambell was very famous and still is to this day because of his extensive knowledge on myths and his theory that myths and epic tales and stories are often similar in some shape or form.  He shows this when he relates Jesus Christ, Buddha and Moses and compares and contrasts each of their stories.  There are three extremely important parts to this: departure, fulfillment, and return.  An example Mr. Cambell uses is when Buddha goes into the woods, runs into ""sinful things"", and then returns to his home.  Cambell thinks into relation to all heroes in myths and epic tales, the hero must lose their inner child.  The hero always is up for any obstacle life throws their way, and then they conquer it.  The obstacle usually makes the hero much stronger and wiser. The hero is then rewarded for his actions.  Hercules is a very well known myth and is a great example of this.
 I did not think to highly of this movie.  Mythology interested me until I watched this movie.  It was very hard for me to really get into it, if you can even say I got into it.  I think instead of giving people on death row the electric chair, they should be forced to sit through this film.",1077148800,6,1670,4.52

He really made me think about our stories when he started comparing Luke Skywalker to a format, much like the taxonomy of species. Every hero goes through almost the same stages. In these stages the hero changes, and becomes something different from other characters. Joseph Campbell showed me that there is a science to everything, and it will be hard for me to watch another movie, without looking for the stages for the hero. He also said, ""The brain is only second to the humanity of a human."" This really made me think about how we look at things. Sometimes it is ok to take things emotionally, but others we must let our brain kick in and take control.
 Joseph has been an inspiration to many people. The way that he has showed us that we are all also heros has made an impact on me. He made me realize that there are different stages that I go through just like any other person, and even my favorite movie characters. This movie is a great movie because it gives yourself a look inside a man's head that you cannot get anywhere else. You get a direct look at how a hero is different from any other character, and it also gives you a different outlook on life. I highly recommend this movie to any Hollywood lover who watches many movies.",1077148800,2,1466,4.350364963503649
669448,3,6303503381,"In The power of myth, Bill Moyer interviewed Joseph Campbell (mythology genius) at the Skywalker ranch.  During this interview, campbell expressed his ideas on mythology and different types of heros.  He described a hero as ""one who has given his life for, or to someone else.""  Also, he said that there are different ways of being a hero, one who saves lives, and then a spiritual hero.  He spoke of how mythology is connected to many present-day cultures and ideas, and mentioned that myths are usually view as the same way for many different cultures and actually bring people together.  He also related mythology to religion in basically saying that there isn't much proof behind a lot of religious stories, and it's the same way with mythology.  I liked how Campbell talked about the ""belly of the whale.""  He said that it was customary for the hero of the story to get stuck in a tough place or position and to escape.  He related this idea of the belly of the whale to the scene in stars wars where they are trapped in the enclosing box, and in the end escape.  He spoke of how a hero usually must take a journey and pass a test during his story/adventure, and that usually towards the end of the adventure he is rewarded for his doings and his quest.  He put it into three basic steps ""Departure, fulfillment, and return.""
The entertainment level of this video wasn't very high, it was quite dull, but very informative at the same time.  If you're looking for an intertaining movie dealing with mythology then i do not reccomend this film.  It was just a straight interview, with little cut away scenes that included action.  As i said though, it is very informative and contains many good facts about mythology and the hero archetype.  This is why I ranked it in the middle with a solid three stars.",1077148800,,1808,4.574534161490683
669449,2,6303503381,"I recently watched the video, ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth."" Bill Moyer interviewed Joseph Campbell about his great knowledge on mythology. Whenever I thought of myths, I always thought of Greek Gods and such. Now having watched this film, I realize that myths come from every single culture around the world. They are all different yet they are all linked together in some way. It was interesting how Joseph Campbell gave examples of myths and heroes from Native American Cultures to Star Wars. I liked how he incorporated recent examples, that gave me a better understanding. You can really tell how devoted Joseph Campbell is to his work. He really knows what he's talking about and I've never heard views like his from anyone else. I thought he was very interesting.
Joseph Campbell really taught me a lot about heroes. Joseph Campbell explains that the life of all heroes are in a cycle. Most all heroes start off by embarking on some sort of journey, then ending up with a reward. The journey tests their ability and strength and shows their determination. The way he described heroes was very well put. He has a way of taking ordinary people and making them seem like terrific heroes. Joseph Campbell is a very insightful person and really made me expand my imagination. He made me think about things that I had never thought about before.
Overall, I thought this movie was somewhat unentertaining, but I really gathered a lot of insight and I enjoyed listening to some points that Joseph Campbell made. He really knows what he's talking about and he's very good at explaining it. I didn't really like the whole interview setup. I thought the information could have been presented in a different format that made it more interesting and entertaining.",1077148800,2,1767,4.8349834983498345
669450,4,6303503381,"In Joseph Campbell and the Power of Mythology, Bill Moyers interviews the modern-day father of mythology, Joseph Campbell. Campbell has many views about different aspects of mythology and these views are very well given in his interview. He expresses his interpretation on the course of events in all mythology. These patterns, as according to Campbell, are separated in to the departure, fulfillment, and return to a ""homeplace"" for social restoration. Campbell deliberately leaves room for the imagination to make its own assumptions of these steps of a hero's adventure. Religion is another that makes use of these components. The departure is the moment when you are first exposed to the religion, the fulfillment is any related action taken in life, and return is the ascent to a type of heaven. Mythology shows that it has many other relations to every day life in this video.
 Campbell also mentions a few different styles of mythology in which he displays vast knowledge. He speaks of Celtic mythology and what I gathered as a viewer as one main difference is that in Celtic mythology, it has a powerful hero following the allure of some entity of wildlife that takes him into numerous unknown lands. Campbell states that there are a wide variety of explanations for natural occurrences in all mythology of ANY type.
 The most important thing that I, as a viewer, gathered from this movie is external affects that mythology has on people after learning of it. All myths deal with an influential change or transformation of the human psyche. Hero's are not just brave adventurers, they have a higher purpose that is never really revealed in the text, but reveals itself in the mind of the reader. A hero, as stated very clearly in this video, must have the internal drive to go ""Into the belly of the whale"" and make it back out. These aspects of mythology has inspired many great things through the sands of time and still continue to do this to this day. Though Campbell is no longer with us to teach us directly, we have his words to think about to help us learn about our society today.
 I would strongly recommend this video to anyone who has even the slightest interest in mythology. Though at times it can be ""slow"", it is still very informative. The viewer will at times be tempted to drift off to sleep, but without a doubt, Campbell will bring up a great point to get your attention again.",1077148800,2,2406,4.751196172248804
669451,1,6303503381,"Mythology has always been something that I have considered though provoking and by watching Joseph Campbell and The Power of the Myth I have realized that it wasn't as awesome as I thought it was.  Yes, it is interesting that someone can base everything around the idea of a myth but it seems to me that a person like that needs to become more grounded.  I can study myths for as long as I want but I don't know if I ever will truly believe them.  I also think that I have become more open to what other people think by watching this video, something that we all should attempt to achieve in our everyday lives.
In the video ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of the Myth"", the famous Bill Moyers interviews Joseph Campbell about how myths are present in our world.  They talk about how myths are present in our everyday lives and the deeper meaning of myths.  Their discussion led to the description of the role of a hero and how the hero progresses throughout a myth.  Mr. Campbell defined a hero as someone who has given their life for something bigger than their own self.  This hero is usually sacrificing something spiritual or physical.  They also talked about the hero cycle.  The hero cycle can vary in its forms, it may be the most obvious thing about someone or it could be something even the hero does not realize is in their possession.  The main moral objective of a hero or heroine is typically to sacrifice himself or herself for something that will ultimately mean more than they do.
Myths are something that every culture posses and I think that we should all be at least open to hearing about them, even if we do not believe them.  This video opened me up to be aware of myths and I think that watching this video has made me a better-rounded person.  Joseph Campbell was the only person that we heard from about myths so I would like to watch some other videos about mythology.  If my 10th grade Honors English teacher reads this I would like to suggest this to her in the future.",1077148800,4,1996,4.405994550408719
669452,4,6303503381,"In this intense and enlightening interview, Bill Moyers interrogates Joseph Campbell about his theories and ideologies of myth.  As this is the favorite subject of Campbell, he always offers exquisite words of wisdom to support myths and the ""life-cycle"" of a hero.  He stated, ""Mythology is the song of the universe to me.""  Throughout history, the pattern of heroic acts and heroes is inevitable and seen in numerous occasions.  The heroic cycle is definitely as subject that is worth writing, and thus, it is obvious in numerous classic literary works.  Heroes have evolved with our culture to suite the morals of the particular time periods.
  Campbell has become such a renowned figure in our society because of his theory that in epic tales, they are all generally plotted alike.  He explains that in the beginning of a hero's adventure, there is one moral objective.  The heroes must sacrifice themselves to save others.  As seen with Moses, Buddha, Jesus Christ and infinite other heroes, there are three essential parts to the adventure:  departure, fulfillment, and return.  Throughout this journey, Campbell believes that the child within the hero must ""die"" to complete the passage into adulthood or to complete the journey.  The adventure is always one that the hero is prepared to undergo or conquer.  The hero gains wisdom and strength throughout this process to return as a successful figure.  The return involves him being highly regarded in society as opposed to his former lower status.  At his return to society, the hero is also rewarded with a grand prize that was promised by an exceptional figure that he idolizes.
 If a viewer is looking for high-quality entertainment, then this is probably not the appropriate feature to watch.  However, we gain great knowledge of the ""hero that lies within us all.""  Throughout the interview, Campbell relates different components of stories, such as dragons, Indians, and snakes to relate them with different aspects of life and to enliven the movie.  The insightful feature fills viewers with knowledge that is often ignored by society, and his most impacting wisdom is to not let one's brain interfere with life but to ""listen to your heart-life.""  He truly believes that everyone has the capabilities to release the hero that resides within us all.

669453,2,6303503381,"The movie ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"" is a movie about heroes and myths and how they can all be related to our everyday life.
 When I watched the movie ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"" I had mixed emotions. For the most part, I thought it was very good, and very educational. But on the other hand, the information could have been presented in a different way, other than an interview.
I liked it because, as I said earlier, it was very educational. I liked how they tied scenes from movies and stories into what Mr. Campbell was talking about. Before seeing this movie, I didn't know much about heroes and myths. After watching it, I felt like I had gained a lot of knowledge.
A bad side to this movie was it was boring. Besides the movie clips, the whole movie was of a man being interviewed. And maybe it's just me, but that doesn't really draw my attention. I think they could have found a much better, and more entertaining way, and give the same information.
I did like the fact that Joseph related everything he said, into something that we all go through. He made it seem personal.
Another thing I liked, which I mentioned earlier, was how the movie puts clips of movies, and told stories in it. It didn't just keep it as an interview the whole time. They showed a lot of clips from ""Star Wars"" and I liked that. And I also really liked the story about the girl and the snakes.
I'm not really sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone. It all depends on what you're interested in. If you are extremely interested in myths and heroes and things along that line, then I would definitely recommend it. Otherwise, I would not recommend it at all, because if you're like me, you would think it was boring.",1077148800,,1732,4.37888198757764
669454,4,6303503381,"Mythology had always interested me, but after watching this movie it gave me a whole new insight about what Mythology really is. I think this movie, ""The Power of Myth,"" was very interesting and fascinating. I really enjoyed to hear what Joseph Campbell had to say about myths, and how he always seemed to make everything seem positive.  ""Myths and dreams come from the same place,"" is what Joseph Campbell once said. When I think about this it just opens my mind to all kinds of imagination and creativeness that I never knew I had.
From the movie, you can definitely tell that he has an incredible imagination, and is very open to his surroundings.  Campbell also said that ""everyone should live life with a feeling of mystery."" I really like the way he expresses things. You can tell that he really devoted his whole life to studying myths and how they relate to all kinds of cultures. Since he has all this knowledge of all kinds of myths, whenever he explained it, it was much easier to comprehend. I thought that how he included many different topics, from Native American myths to Star Wars was very interesting.
Mythology used to always make me think of fairies and make believe things, but it changed greatly after watching this movie. Mythology may appear to me in this way, Campbell really helped me to understand the true meaning of it. To me, the true meaning is learning about heroes and how they are affected by their decisions. Although, the hero may go through hard times in the end his life turns out to be better than before.
Overall, I think that people should take the time to watch this movie, because it gives you a break from the everyday lives that we have. It makes you think broader and bigger, (it's like a brain exercise.) I encourage everyone to really listen to get something out of Joseph Campbell's points in Mythology, because he has a great amount to offer!",1077148800,3,1892,4.611275964391691
669455,4,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell: The Power Of Myth is a movie in which every conceivable attempt is made to pack as much information into a movie as possible. The movie is extremely detailed, but is also for the most part rather drab. The movie lacks the energy and color to keep most students attentive throughout its expanse. The Star Wars pictures and clips do provide some release from the constant discussion of Joseph Campbell and his interviewer, but these clips only provide momentary salvation. Most students will wilt in the movie's constant jabber and lose their focus; therefore, the movie teaches little. This reality is made truer by the fact that you must have a rudimentary knowledge of the hero's quest and myths to even understand the movie. At the end of the movie, you are unlikely to know anything more than you began with because most of the movie is not spent discussing and defining concepts, but is spent giving examples that may be both literary or historical in origin. I will concede that this movie may be a good way to introduce those who are completely new to the realm of mythology to its many intricacies, but the movie is for the most part useless in higher levels of learning and intellect. So in summation, Joseph Campbell: The Power Of Myth is a detailed, but rather boring movie. It can be used to educate, but only in classes with extremely interested and dedicated students.",1077148800,2,1398,4.733606557377049
669456,2,6303503381,"""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"" is a very opinionated film. The whole film is just the way one person, Joseph Campbell, feels about heroes and life and such. Although I thought the film was kind of boring, there were some aspects about the film that I did like. The content was very good. I liked the way Campbell talked about people. He said that you must ""find your bliss and follow it."" No matter what happens or what people think you must always follow it. I also liked the way he related the dragon to your conscious. He said that if you hear a voice inside saying, ""I can't do this,"" that's the dragon inside you speaking.

  Another thing that I liked was Campbell's view on heroes. He said that a hero was someone that is just a regular person, then they get into the so called ""belly of the whale"" and somehow you get out of the ""belly of the whale"" and you are transformed as a person and when you come out you are a whole new person. I feel that view is definitely correct. People must go through something and change to become a true hero.
  Campbell thought that everyone was trying to find a place of peace, a place inside them of rest. I don't really agree with that because I don't think everyone is trying to find that ""place."" Of course there are moments when people want to be stress free and be in that ""place"" but I do not think that that is what people are trying to find in life.

  This film didn't really impact me too much, it didn't do much for me. The film as a whole was boring. I realize that it was an interview and it's kind of hard to make it interesting but it didn't interest me at all. The one part that I did enjoy was the part when they showed clips from Star Wars. Even though I agree with some things and I like a few parts, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless they are extremely interested in heroes and myths and other things like that.",1077148800,,1898,4.195054945054945
669457,4,6303503381,"About a week ago our tenth grade honors literature class began to watch the Joseph Campbell and the power of myth movie.  I didn't really understand what a myth was until we embarked on this video to introduce our future studies on mythology.  When out teacher informed us that we would be watching this movie I wasn't interested in the least bit but upon watching it I realized that the information Joseph addressed was quite appealing to me.  This movie shows Joseph Campbell's extreme knowledge and devout studies in mythology.  Not only did he explain some ancient stories but also some of his own.  Bill Moyer interviews Joseph Campbell through out the movies.  Campbell not only tells about the myths that have been passed down for centuries but about how Star Wars the movies has incorporated heroic characters that were derived from myths long ago.  Campbell was a very spiritual man through out his life, but did not follow one set religion.  He was passionately involved with mythology and theology.  He felt that there were so many things that should be explored and with religious boundaries in the way, he found it to be impossible.  Campbell was a very intellectual and broad man.  He realized that although there were many different cultures and religions in the world, there was still unity in the fact that many of them shared the same myths.  This movie was, at times, a little slow but it did actually show me that much of our culture was shaped from mythology and the myths that have been passed down over the centuries.  My final thought about the movie is that it is satisfying in the fact that it broadens your outlooks and aspects in the direction of myths.  It gave me a since of warmth knowing that soon I would be also embarking on such great studies which before watching the movie seemed like a horrible thing.",1077148800,2,1839,4.688473520249222
669568,4,6303503381,"Along with the rest of my tenth grade honors English class, I recently watched ""Joseph Campell and the power of myth"". This interview with Campell, the leading authority on mythology, was both informative and entertaining. Mr. Campell was very well-spoken and authoritative in his speech, and the interview was amusing as well as entertaining. The dialogue between Mr. Bill Moyer and Joseph Campell takes place on Skywalker ranch, owned by George Lucas. Lucas is a close friend of Campell's, and is also the creator of the well-known and popular ""Star Wars"" movie series.
Interestingly, Campell states that the plot of the ""Star Wars"" movies follows the traditional pattern of the mythological hero's journey. This journey takes place in many stories, including religious tales. Jesus, Muhammed, and Buddah(Siddhartha) are all alike in the way that they experiance the hero's journey. All depart from the life they know and venture out into a foriegn place to begin their quest. They are then tempted and endure many trials before their return home. The trials that they experiance change their conciousness and are significant to the quest and to their lives in general. After they return and choose diciples, their stories usually end with their deaths, which may or may not be tragic and symbolic.
  Another aspect of the hero's quest dicussed in the video is the manner in which the hero departs on his quest. Some heroes, such as Frodo from ""Lord of the Rings"" venture into their questknowingly and willingly. However, in some myths, the hero chases an animal which leads him into a strange and foriegn land. One such story is the classic tale of ""Alice in Wonderland"".
Many heroes must defeat a monster on his quest, such as a dragon. In the myth of Heracules, he destroys many monsters, such as the Hydra and the Nemean lion. These monsters represent the hero's own fears and inner evils. He must conquer these forces within himself in order to complete his quest. By destroying these monsters, he proves himself and becomes completly and wholly good.
Joseph Campell discusses his own hero in the interview, the silent screen star Douglas Fairbanks. Though Campell confesses that he wanted to be like Fairbanks, the  literary world has much to thank Campell for in the area of mythology. I am personally glad that he became the person he did. As Campell said, ""A hero is someone who has given his life to something bigger than himself"". I think we can all agree that Campell has indeed given his life to the study and exploration  of the meaning of myth. This means, quite simply, that Joseph Campell is himself, a hero.",1077148800,,2627,4.90990990990991

The film is basically just Bill Moyers interviewing Joseph Campbell at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch.  The video is very educational but extremely boring.  Campbell is very intelligent, knows a lot about mythology, and gives excellent examples to prove his points.  In the video Campbell gives extremely good, educational information about mythology but it is very boring!
 Campbell does a great job at showing how the majority of mythological heroes are basically the same.  The part that really made me see that Campbell has a point is when he tells how Jesus and Buddha went through similar journeys.  Both Jesus and Buddha had to go through the three tests.  Campbell goes on to shows how Buddha, Jesus, Luke Skywalker, Moses, and Jonah in the whale's stomach are all very similar heroes that went through similar tests and events.  It is interesting to hear Campbell talk about how modern day movie heroes relate to ancient ones.
 Campbell does a great job at showing how most religions are similar.  Even though I am not really religious it is very interesting to hear Campbell compare religions.
 People can learn a lot about mythology, if they can stand to watch the whole video.  The video is repetitive in what it is saying about mythology and it starts to get boring fast.  The repetitiveness actually adds to the video from an educational stand point because it is showing that most heroes are basically the same.
 I would recommend this video to anyone who is interested in mythology, history or religion.  This video is good to give students an introduction into mythology because it is not hard to understand and give many key points about the hero and his journey.",1077148800,2,1784,4.877076411960133
669570,4,6303503381,"I believe that Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth was a very insightful tool that has taught me about the needs of and purposes for myths.  I never really considered why we had myths and to be true I never really cared.  But after I watched Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth, I was stunned by the connections I could draw from the movie to my own life.  This movie really opened my eyes in the purpose and course of action of human behavior.  The analogies and real life situations Joseph Campbell gave in his explanation of what it is to be a hero showed me that there is a bit of hero in us all.
I am in an honors English class and we were supposed to watch this movie to find out what a true hero really was.  I was expecting a dull, boring movie that would make you want to fall asleep.  What I got was an amazingly emotional film that made me think about my surroundings and my future.
Mr. Campbell describes the life of a hero as a cycle of going away and coming back.  He says that the hero starts his journey with a certain sense of consciousness and at the end of the journey he gains a greater sense of consciousness and understanding.  That is what all myths deal with, the transformation of consciousness by trials.  The hero shows his purity through his determination and, if necessary, the sacrifice of his life to something bigger than himself.
Joseph Campbell's ability to make people stop and think about the myths on which their lives are composed of is unbelievable.  Mr. Campbell is an amazing man, I am very impressed with the unfathomable amount of information on myths he has consumed over his very extensive carrier.
Once again, I would like to salute Joseph Campbell on his beautiful explanation of what it is to be a hero.  I am truly a different person after watching his video.",1077148800,3,1812,4.395209580838324
669571,2,6303503381,"I'd never really studied mythology until I got into my 10th grade Honors English class this semester.  My class opened the topic by watching part of Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth.  I found it to be very confusing because Joseph Campbell ( while he may be the foremost authority on mythology) was hard to understand.  While he explained the five parts of a hero's journey fairly well, he seemed to drift from one subject to another without really giving any facts about the subject.  Also, he would drone on and on about one subject without really discussing it.  The video was poorly made, too.  While the video had some good editing (e.g. - Joseph Campbell was discussing Star Wars and scenes from Episode IV: A New Hope and Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back were shown),  the camera stay focused on Campbell for long periods of time without any visual aids or changes in camera angles.
 Now, Campbell's comparison of mythology to Star Wars actually did help me figure out the parts of mythology.  Campbell talked about the fact that in space there are no boundaries.  By comparison, in Star Wars the setting had no limits.  He talked about how Luke Skywalker was the hero of the story, how Han Solo changed from mercenary to hero, how Mos Eisley Spaceport was the first threshold our heroes crossed, and how Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie's adventure in the trash compactor aboard the first Death Star was the hero(es) crossing another threshold.  Being a Sci-Fi kinda guy, this comparison helped my understanding of the levels of mythology.  Overall though, even after the Star Wars comparison, I still found the video difficult to follow.

669572,5,6303503381,"I recently watched Joseph Campbell's video part one of the Joseph Campbell and the power of mythology. The movie interview between Campbell and Moyer was very intriguing and interesting. I thoroughly began to take mythology into a whole another idea. I began to see things in a new and different perspective. His beliefs on religion and mythology help me understand them better in a new way. One example is when he compares the Christian prophet Jesus to the Buddha God. In his explanation he explains that Jesus goes through three temptations while on a journey, and as does the Buddha God. This example really helps me put together that when it comes down to it all religions are a like a little in some way. I believe Joseph Campbell was a brilliant man with extraordinary gifts to help people understand mythology and other things better. The way he takes mythology and breaks it down to every little detail to helps give me a better understanding of it all.  Until I recently watched this video I had never really taken it into consideration how much mythology has to do with history and cultures. Mythology has a lot to do with how a culture works and what the culture is based on. Joseph Campbell really used his brain when came up with his ideas on mythology and other things. He helped me to develop the idea that different cultures all over the world have much in common.  In the video he really brought that idea out of me and helped me open my mind to different views and to be more open with my thoughts. Overall I thought Joseph Campbell was an extraordinary man, who was very smart and had brilliant ideas.

This movie really opened my soul to a new way of thinking about what a hero aactually is.  A hero is someone who doesn't always start out as being good, but they always end up doing the right thing in the end.
Joseph Campbell really had the whole hero idea figured out when he was interviewed in the video.  The stories he told and examples he provided showed me ordinary people whom I had little to no interest in, and presented them as being a hero of the world.  The views he shared and the analogies he compared really shaped my perception on how I look at and read mythology and ancient writing.
I am a pretty deep guy, but Joseph Campbell gives deep a whole new meaning.  He was talking about how ""mythology is the song of the universe"" and that earth is really just one person within itself.  It was a really interesting way to look at our lives.  This movie has changed the way I look at life and the heavens that control it.
What really inspires me is the confidence Campbell displayed during the interview when he was asked difficult questions that I was ""green"" to.  In a way, I would say Campbell could be an example of a modern day hero.  I'm sure he had to put great effort into researching and studying about the subject of mythology.  Then, to top it all off, he had to express his thoughts, feelings, and emotions in words while being filmed!  This man is awesome!  I can't believe he knows all that he does about heroes and the way they have shaped our society and world.
The future of my life lies in the hands of me and the decisions I choose to, or not to make.  Joseph Campbell has provided with valuable life lessons and intriguing insight that has changed me as a person.  I want to read and watch more of Joseph Campbell.

669574,2,6303503381,"I would give The Power Of Myth series at best a rating of tolerable.  The series contains superfluous amounts of information and is extraordinarily detailed, but to achieve this level of content, a lethargic pace was used, as well as an almost insufferable amount of conversation.  Joseph Campbell spends most of the movie discussing the hero's quest and how it can apply to almost any character.  The only truly bright spot in the movie is the use of Star Wars clips.  This action allows for a brief moment of enjoyment and respite, before the return to the slow talks of myths and heroes.  I found the application of the hero's quest to Jesus' life interesting also.  These few moments of interesting oration did not subtract from the movie's overall effect of slowly draining the energy out of everyone who should be unfortunate enough to have to endure it.  Another site of interest was in the use of many old pictures and paintings in the movie.  These beautiful works of art added somewhat to the sluggish atmosphere and made the movie somewhat more tolerable.  So in conclusion, Joseph Campbell: The Power Of Myth has its good points, but overall it is particularly boring.",1077148800,3,1180,4.801980198019802
669575,4,6303503381,"I enjoyed the interview with Joseph Campbell done by Bill Moyers. Campbell's
words were descriptive and moving. I loved the way he described the hero archetype as
the hero with 1,000 faces that is detected is stories everywhere. Campbell said the hero is
the one who has given his life to something other than himself with the moral objective to
save something suck as a people or an idea as he evolves with the culture around him.
 Something else I enjoyed Campbell speak about was the comparisons of Moses,
Christ, Buddha, and the last prophet Muhammad to heroes in the fact that they each had a
calling, a departure, a triumph, a return, and a reward. These are the five basic parts of a
hero's journey. All four of these men also had a ""transformation of consciousness"", as
described by Campbell.
 I agree with Campbell in the sense that George Lucas' movie Star Wars showed
great examples of the standard mythical heroes. In the movie the hero, Luke Skywalker,
goes for something. Campbell describes this as more than just the hero going for sudden
adventure. Campbell brilliantly calls it ""serendipitous."" The definition of the word
serendipity is the occurrence of discoveries by accident. Thus meaning the hero is
somewhat called upon by fate and he only gets the adventure he is ready for.
 Another thing spoken about in the interview that I particularly liked was the ""belly
of the whale"" sequence. This gained its mythological meaning from the Biblical tale of
Jonah and the Whale. Campbell compares this story to a similar sequence in the movie
Star Wars where Skywalker, Princess Lea, and Chewbacca are stuck in the garbage
compact and have to escape.
 In closing, I thought the interview was a quite beautiful way to explain the hero
archetype. My favorite part of the interview was when Bill Moyers asked Joseph Campbell
to explain to him and clarify his understanding of the meaning of the myth. Campbell says
to Moyers that these myths are not just stories, but that we live and breathe the myth. It is
almost as if we are the myth. Campbell says that this is so because we are the
consciousness, or the eyes, of the earth. I believe we are.",1077148800,3,2158,4.7313829787234045
669576,3,6303503381,"The Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure is an informative interview that is drenched with wisdom.  However, it was not too entertaining or intriguing. In this film, author, Joseph Campbell is interviewed by Bill Moyers.  The interview was filmed on Skywalker Ranch.  In this intense interview, Campbell explains his logic on Hero Cycles, which represent a ""going and return.""  Campbell explains how every hero must first die or leave his present condition and then mature into a full adult hero.  He believes that everyone is a hero at birth.  In his interview, Campbell gives many examples to back up his beliefs and theories.  The setting of the interview gives rise to one example, George Lucas's Star Wars Episodes.  Several clips from Star Wars are shown in this video, and through these movie clippings, viewers can see the type of heroic steps these characters take as Joseph Campbell explains them to his interviewer.
 Campbell gives many other examples of heroes throughout the interview; some of these heroes include:  Moses, Buddha, Muhammad, and Jesus Christ.  One can follow Moses' heroic steps, which are departure, fulfillment, and return.  Campbell enlightens Moyers and all viewers how every hero follows the same cycle or pattern such as these steps that Moses took.  He says there must be some kind of transformation of consciousness through trials and revelations before one becomes a hero.
 To help clarify his point and to spice up the interview a bit, Campbell tells mythological stories; he tells stories of Indians, dragons, and snakes.  He says that we all can find our heroic path by finding our bliss and capturing it.  Campbell says that myths are stories that tell the mystery of life and that they evolve from the same place as dreams do.
 This film is very deep, and at times, it is hard to follow because of its slow pace.  I would not recommend anyone watch this who is searching for a captivating and engaging movie or anyone who cares nothing for heroic myths.  However, if you are curious about the adventures of heroes, this is the movie for you!",1077062400,2,2084,4.902857142857143
669577,4,6303503381,"I am a sophomore in high school and recently watched ""Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"" as an introductory into mythology  for an honors literature class. As my instructor pushed in the tape, telling us students to  pay attention and listen closely, I fully expected to spend the next hour or so in a state of moderate monotony. I was pleasantly surprised, however, when this video turned out to be a enchanting interlude into philosophy.
I have always had an avid interest in history and consequently history's myths. The connections that two cultures, located on separate ends of the world, can unknowingly make through mythology is an captivating concept worthy of scholarly interest. For instance, a constellation in our night sky known as the Seven Sisters is clearly referred to as a grouping of seven stars in many ancient cultures, even though only six are visible to the naked eye.
The sheer magnitude of Campbell's comprehension and realization of the human conscious left me with the same aftertaste as J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven. I felt as if I myself had undertaken the hero's path myself. I had transcended into a world of higher understanding through Campbell's words and theories and had come back altered in ways that I know will unquestionably mold my conscious and unconscious thoughts. I loved Campbell's view of the 'hero inside.' To me, one does not have to go out and do the classic bit of saving the world. Instead, a hero is found in the most unlikely of places. Whether it is Frodo Baggins, a small child battling AIDS in a world that could-if the prosperous realized their duty to humanity-at least prevent the disease from deteriorating, or a stranger on the street who drops a dollar in a homeless man's cup. The largest acts of heroism are not always the grandest or most recognized.
Where would humanity be without the hero? The hero serves as a basis for behavior, defining the concept of bravery and self sacrifice. The deeds of a hero echo with mortal man's desire to rise above themselves and become that elusive 'more.'  I loved Campbell's quote at the beginning of the film. He stated, 'We are not alone, for all the heroes of the world have gone before us.' Eloquently said, Mr. Campbell, and the quintessence of truth, if I might say.
Another phrase that has been floating around in my mind, refusing to leave, is the phrase 'easy religion, cheaply achieved.' The weight, the truth of that statement rings clear in my mind. Too often, in our world today, people adopt a faith, not truly knowing or bothering to discover the intricate complexity of humanity's concept of the divine. Religion cannot be a fad. It must be gained through an individual's innate pull to God, no matter the form that one desires to worship.
Campbell brought up another point that I thought was highly intriguing. He stated that humanity was in fact the living, breathing consciousness of Ghia, the Earth. I had never thought of this concept before; I had always viewed the Earth as a separate entity abused by humanity. As always, though, Campbell's words had laid a new perspective to one of my long accepted concepts.
In other words, I fully recommend the words and thoughts of Mr. Campbell to anyone who wishes to attain a greater understanding of the human conscious and the very concept of a hero. Though the video does not have a Hollywood style plot, it doesn't need it. Joseph Campbell has the ability to draw you in without the use of grandiose stunts.",1077062400,,3524,4.754901960784314
669658,5,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell was a teacher of the great spiritual truths from all of the world's religions.  Campbell shows us the difference between connotation and denotation and invites us to read the mythology of the world as a field of reference that refers directly to the transcendent.  Mythology is a complicated language built on metaphors that can stump the ill-advised.  In this series of interviews we learn that the organs of the body are in conflict with one another and the conflict is externalized by the creative power of our mythic imagination.  The interviews are sprinkled with clips of fascinating footage from cultures around the world as well as works of art and brief illustrated stories set to music.
Bill Moyers asks Campbell questions in a sometimes rigid and stilted voice but his heart is in the right place and he is certainly barking up the right tree.  Together they explore difficult questions about the state of the world and the continuing relevance of mythology in rapidly changing times.  Campbell as a teacher is gentle and inspires us to move forward along the course of our own lives armed with the tools of perception, wisdom and reflection.  Along the way there are warnings about the dangers of rigid adherence to systems that threaten to overpower our own humanity.  There are also invitations to see what is beautiful.  Man has struggled over the ages to come to terms with a world that is at once both nurturing and threatening.  In this modern world we wait for men like Joseph Campbell to come along and offer us the historical perspective and mental architecture that will help us build a healthy and functioning world view.  We are challenged to do nothing less than bring forth the full potential of our beings for our own benefit and for the benefit of those around us.  Watching these DVD's is about one of the best ways a person can spend some free time, there are very important conversations to explore here.",1074124800,2,1951,4.808383233532934
669659,5,6303503381,"Of my two favorite memories of Campbell's talks with Bill Moyers of PBS in this video, the one that comes to mind is an introduction between Campbell and a Catholic Priest, perhaps a Cardinal, that he retells. After they are introduced and the Priest is told who Dr. Campbell is and a little about his life, he asks him, ""Are you still Catholic?"" To which he replies ""No, Father."" He then asks--and Campbell was impressed by his specificity--""Do you believe in a *personal* God?"" To which Campbell replies, ""No, Father.""
The Priest then replies, almost as if to engage in a debate and denigrate the atheist's worship of the rational mind uber alles simultaneously (and an atheist is what you are led to assume he thinks Campbell is), ""Well, I guess there is no way to logically prove the existence of God."" And Campbell answers, calmly, ""If there were Father, what would be the value of faith?""
""It's been a pleasure meeting you Dr. Campbell, have a nice day.""
Regardless of your faith, interest, background or education, you will find yourself in the same shoes of that Priest when you watch this incredibly enjoyable DVD set. Campbell's erudition and knowledge of the many ideas, subtexts and similarities inherent in the world's treasure trove of mythology is daunting to say the least, and his approach is designed to have it all make sense to the modern human heart.  And Bill Moyers, whose worst day as a journalist surpasses many in the business' finest, is at the compassionate and intuitive top of his intellectual game here; he conintuously asks the kind of transcendentally-inspired questions that don't just allow Campbell to riff on the oceanic themes of his knowledge, but make their interview-turned-conversations as joyful and illuminating to watch as Miles and Coltrane playing the blues is to listen to.
THE POWER OF MYTH, the book, may be the best book written to serve as a doorway to the eternal wisdom of mythology, as it manifests itself in the wisdom, theology, art and entertainment of every culture--not to mention our personal lives.  But the very popular book is simply a printing of chunks of this all-inclusive video set, recorded as it appeared on PBS some fifteen years ago, now digitally recorded on this DVD set.  As such, they are a must have.
To say these DVDs will make you think is almost denigrating it; it will make you ponder. It will lead you (after quite possibly confusing the hell out of you, as you try to absorb it into a preexisting way of thinking that may become obsolete via what Campbell teaches) to wonder, the way children wonder. And in the end, I was understating its power in the title of my review; it will make you smile from the soul, not just from the heart.
I highly recommend this as an introduction to the fascinating and redemptive world of mythology in general and the labyrinthian mind of Joseph Campbell in particular.  I also recommend Campbell's best selling book HERO OF A THOUSAND FACES after this has whet your appetite's soul.",1073260800,132,3000,4.785714285714286
669660,5,6303503381,"Not since Carl Sagen have I heard a man so in love with his subject. Joseph Campbell encourages us to remove the blinders imposed by religious leaders and to view life with our own eyes and to form our own opinions, to decide for ourselves what we truely believe. I have the DVD and the book. While the book is great, listening to Campbell brings the information home. In this time of emotional and religious upheaval it is imperative that we as a people broaden our view so as not to be lead down a path to our own destruction.",1072569600,6,528,4.29
669661,3,6303503381,"In The Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure (Volume One), Bill Moyers, the show's host, interviews Joseph Campbell, the father of modern myth. The interview is set on George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch in Northern California. The reason for this seemingly random setting is one of the main themes in the movie, which is how George Lucas's Star Wars movies can relate to myths of old. The movie involves many various clips from the three original Star Wars movies (Episode IV: A New Hope, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, and Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi) that depict certain aspects of myths being described in the interview. I think it is very interesting the way that the Star Wars movies are tied right into the interview and how the clips are shown along the way. Joseph Campbell does a very well job describing the myths he told about in the interview and telling how they relate to the Star Wars Clips. I believe this movie is a very complete portrayal of myths that can be a real learning experience for someone new to the world of mythology and even someone learned in the ways of myths. This movie is a bit slow a times, but a powerful movie nonetheless. I would recommend it for an older crowd, just because of the deep and intellectual level of the movie.

669662,2,6303503381,"As I started out my sophomore year in high school, I had the class honors 10th grade English 230. I learned, soon after school started, that in this class we would be studying mythology. I was very excited as I learned of this information.
 Around the 4th week of school, my class watched the first movie of a series, called ""The Power of Myth."" It was about the life of Joseph Campbell, whom was an expert on mythology. In the video, Bill Moyers interviewed Campbell. Although the video was informative, it was a little dry and not very entertaining. Listening to Campbell and his beliefs was interesting, but otherwise not very enjoyable.
 I liked the viewpoints Campbell had on hero's and the examples he gave of such people. He used examples through time and compared them to today. Campbell described the hero's life: the unusual birth, long initiating journey, victory over a battle, mysterious death, and maybe even rebirth. Even though I liked the information given, it took a lot to settle down, pay attention, and watch the video. Overall, I didn't like the video.",1063065600,3,1074,4.8
669663,3,6303503381,"I am a sophomore in high school. Recently, during my English class we watched The Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure Volume 1. I found this biography of Joseph Campbell and his beliefs very intriguing. Although things of this nature normally do not attract me, this video was able to hold my attention. I found it very interesting especially when he talked about a hero having a thousand faces. As the video progressed, I understood more and more what he meant by this. He made me see that anyone can be a hero. Anyone person who achieves something out of the ordinary is a hero. It was also very clever of him to say that a newborn baby is a hero from the start. He said a baby was a hero because they undergo a very large transformation from the womb of the mother to a living, breathing mortal. The more you think about it, this actually makes complete sense. When someone has to give up their infantile characteristics early and start behaving in a more mature state they too are a hero. Such as when a young child has to take on responsibilities normally of and elder, for instance when an older sibling who is also young themselves raise their younger brother and sister. They become heroic figures without even realizing it. I think what I liked most about this moves is that Joseph Campbell was able to speak in laymen terms that any common man or woman could understand even though his is a man of such great brilliance. I would most definitely recommend this video.",1062979200,4,1476,4.5111940298507465
669664,4,6303503381,"I'm a sophomore in high school, and I was required to watch this video as part of a mythology study in my literature class.  I've never been all that interested in mythology, but this video contributed to my interest in the concepts behind the mythology being greatly increased.  Joseph Campbell doesn't see mythology in the light that most people do.  Most people will see it as an ancient reference point for pretentious idiots.  However, Campbell makes mythology very alive.  He uses his incredibly vast library of knowledge on the mythologies of the Greeks, Japanese, Native Americans, and countless others to relate it all back to life today.
One of the things that Campbell said that appealed most to me was his statement about listening to the inner voice.  He talks about how one should live as he or she wants to without worrying about what anyone else thinks.  He calls that being a ""maverick,"" and Campbell refers to himself as a maverick.  He talks about how he lived exactly as he wanted to live, and he gives examples of how the myths support this.  He talks about how the myths, in attempting to explain nature, give us many clues as to the cause of many psychological states in our present-day society.
He discusses the role of women in ancient myths, and how it influences many of today's views and customs.  Women are the cradles of life in the natural world, and since natural life is a time of tribulation in most religions, this creates the negative view of women in mythology.
He talks of how everyone is a hero on some level, but how not all take this and truly live.  Campbell talks of how we must ""die to ourselves"" as children, for instance, and be reborn as something new.  This is one sense in which we are all heroes.  He also speaks on how a simple median for anyone to see almost all of the basic archetypes and conditions of mythology would be to watch the Star Wars series.  Personally, I would rather read Campbell's books, but that's only because I don't like Star Wars.
In conclusion, Campbell takes mythology, which, in many people's eyes, formerly including me, is a dead subject, and he transforms it into something alive with incredible bearing and necessity in today's world.  I would recommend that anyone watch this video, and afterword, if you want, I guess you could watch STar Wars.",1062979200,8,2328,4.671568627450981
669665,2,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell was a man who sent the majority of his life researching about myths. He researched everything from their origin to how they've changed over time. He spent a great deal of time connecting these myths with things we are familiar with today. In the series he created, ""The Power of Myth"", I watched volume one, ""The Hero's Adventure."" In this movie he was having a great discussion with Bill Moyers about mythology and what he has discovered
In the movie, he refers to Star Wars many times, especially in comparing Darth Vader to the ""dark side"". He continues to return to this Star Wars analogy throughout the movie.  He goes into great depth about what he has learned and how it has affected many things as well as providing some far out examples that I would've never imagined myself. He continued to give a great amount of information supporting his beliefs, and giving very detailed examples. However, I have to say that I found my interest level declining as the movie went on. The more I watched, the more I caught myself as my mind began to drift off. I found it hard to keep my interest focused simply on two men talking about mythology, mainly because mythology is not something that keeps my interest very well in the first place
This movie did provide a large amount of information and very detailed examples. It also gave some analogies and was very educational and informative. I think I would have enjoyed this movie much more if I were more like Joseph Campbell, meaning if I were more interested in going in depth with mythology. It's obvious that he has spent most of his life researching this topic and I do respect him for that. He is a very intelligent man and despite the fact that I did not entirely enjoy this movie, I still have to say that it was packed with tons of information
I would not suggest to anyone that this movie be changed or modified for it is fine the way it is. It gets his point across just the way he wants it, so it should not be changed. The only reason I couldn't quite keep my mind from wandering off subject was because I don't have that perfect understanding of mythology so I couldn't quite comprehend everything being said",1062979200,2,2187,4.5227272727272725
669666,4,6303503381,"I am a sophomore in high school and in class we watched the Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth movie during class.  I figured this was going to be just another boring biography that I would not enjoy, but it turned out to be just the opposite.  Joseph Campbell talked about many different interesting topics but one of the main topics was those such as heroes.  He mentioned the five parts of a hero's journey, which included: a call to adventure (when the hero embarks upon a journey), crossing the threshold (can only pass threshold by confronting death in some way), the test (passing through difficult experiences or temptations), the reward, and the return.  An example of this was when he compared Jesus and Buddha.  He mentioned that all heroes encounter temptation and then has to overcome these temptations, which could be referred to as ""the test"".  He showed how this implied to both Jesus and Buddha. Satan tempted Jesus by offering him all the kingdoms of the world if he would worship him but I find this ironic that he was tempting Jesus who was the only son of God with something that he already possessed. Buddha went searching for enlightenment which was a temptation because this led him to denying himself of the many pleasures of life.
Another topic that he talked about was one that I found the most interesting.  He discussed the relation between women and nature.  Bill Moyers stated that in many myths all of the difficulties that came in life were generally blamed on women.  An example of a difficulty was when the first sin was committed.  Eve committed this sin, which led to blaming everything bad that happened in life on women.  This greatly affected me and led me to think about how that is still happening today.
 I think Joseph Campbell is a very intelligent man and proves this through all of his in-depth thoughts during the interview.  I found that some of the things he talked about were very complex and hard to understand.  I think this movie would be better for older students studying mythology because they would have a better understanding of what he was talking about and would probably grasp his complex thoughts and analogies.",1062979200,2,2177,4.724867724867725
669667,2,6303503381,"In my sophomore English class, we watched the video in this series that detailed the hero's journey.  The Power Myth series consists of a total of six movies.  They feature Bill Moyer interviewing Joseph Campbell.  Joseph Campbell is the world's premiere expert on myths; therefore, most of the questions revolve around myths and how they fit into modern culture.
 I felt this movie was mostly boring at the beginning.  It begins very slowly.  There are few pictures and endless discussion that can ensnare the mind to the point where the brain can no longer process the vast amount of information dispensed by Dr. Campbell.  The Star Wars comparison and the pictures that come with this topic bring on a needed break.  The examples given throughout the video are excellent.  The examples show how myth permeates our culture and every other culture on earth.  Dr. Campbell gives examples of heroes within most of the major cultures.
 As I have said, the video is boring at the beginning.  It picks up around one-fourth of the way through it.  The information content was excellent.  Every conceivable vantage point on the topic was covered.  The information was also well articulated.  It was spoken in a fashion that made it easy to understand.  There is too much talking though.  The superfluous talking makes it hard to pick up on the main points that are expressed.
 Overall, I did not like the movie.  I felt it was uninteresting and lacked the pictures necessary to keep the audience involved.  Although this movie presents a wealth of knowledge, it is presented in a format that makes it unwanted and mainly indecipherable after the first few minutes of the movie.  Also the fact that I have no great interest in the subject would have a bearing on this review.  The thing I really liked the most about this movie was its reference to and use of Star Wars clips.  The clips add a lot of needed excitement to the movie, but they make it nearly impossible to concentrate on what Dr. Campbell is saying.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has an interest in myths and wishes to learn from the very best in that field.",1062979200,,2124,4.706521739130435
669757,4,6303503381,"I am a sophomore in high school and I am studying Mythology in my English class. We watched the Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth movie in class. This movie was very informative and elucidated mythology and the attributes that a hero must possess. The basis of this movie was the interviews with Joseph Campbell.  Bill Moyer did the interviews in 1985 and 1986.  In these interviews, Joseph Campbell reinforced the fact that a hero must make a sacrifice in order to be a hero.  He used the slaying of a dragon as an example; his example was that if someone slays a dragon even though you may disagree with dragon slaying you should still respect the person who slays the dragon because that person is a hero.  A hero is a person who makes sacrifices. In watching this movie I have come to the realization that one way or another everyone is a hero.  Everyone makes sacrifices just to get through a day.  He referred to the dragon several times; he said that the dragon represented greed.  The dragon in relation to human nature is ""binding of oneself to ones own ego,"" said Campbell.  To release one's inner dragon Campbell suggests that you find your bliss.  This bliss is the place that everyone wants to find during his or her journey through life.  Unless people find their center then tension will occur.  Campbell also explained several things that a hero must endure to be a hero. One of these this is temptation.  As an example, Campbell explained how several religious symbols were heroes. In the Buddhist religion Buddha would be the hero, he withstood many temptations while searching for enlightenment.  Christianity was the other example and Jesus was the hero.  He also resisted many temptations without compliance.  This movie has taught me to look for a hero not only in myths but in everyday life also.  I would recommend this movie to students who already have a basic understanding of Mythology.

In these videos, Campbell enriches my knowledge on mythology and gives an explanation with great detail about various themes in the subject.  The great comparisons Campbell makes between mythology and our regular lives, reflect how enriching and resourceful mythology can be.
Learning that our backgrounds have various similarities has increased my spirituality. The spirituality that Campbell offers is a way to discover the true meaning of your own life.  Knowing that our life isn't just the simple ritual that we make it every day makes me feel the power to change it from the usual customary day.  He's views on life are different from the ones that ordinary people have.  The knowledge he has helps him see more of life than what we see.  Transmitting this information to us empowers us to have the power that mythology offers through history.  Knowing that life is more than what we make it and having the knowledge of mythology can help anybody make the best of life.  Increasing your spiritual, and maybe even your emotional level will change your perspective of human beings.
The connections you will encounter in the videos will seem meaningless at first but  after you realize that mythology is a great subject of matter that hides the mystery of our life, you will want to know more about it.  Mythology is a great subject that can teach you  various lessons.  As Campbell offers it, it can be an enriching and extraordinary experience that you will find helpful in various forms throughout any subject of life.

Joseph Campbell explained every thing really simple so anyone could understand it.  To talk about things like that so even people in my grade can comprehend means he knows what he is talking about.  He also seemed to be a very nice, humble person and that is a good quality to have.  It really helped me to learn about archetypes when he talked about movies.  ""Star Wars"" had many archetypes and seeing them really helped me to understand them.  It is weird to see how many stories now a day take pieces of myths and put them into their stories.  Without myths a lot of stories would have as good of a story.  The Iroqoi myth was pretty cool; it had a lot of the archetypes.  The old man in the mask could be the mentor and the seven snake brothers could be the creatures of nightmare because snake people scare everyone.
 There were parts of the interview where Joseph Campbell lost me completely.  The main part he lost me on was the part about the water symbolizing the unconscious. I understood the Iroqoi myth about the seven brothers that were magicians until the woman crossed the creek and Joseph Campbell talked about the unconscious and I was just let in the dust.  That is the only part of the whole movie I did not understand.
 This was a very interesting movie and I would like to see the rest of the series.  This one was great and really helped me in my English class.

He shows that many myths are the same throughout the world, and do not change over time. This he says, leads him to believe that all people are the same on a basic level. Since myth is based on life, he concludes that life itself is very much the same for everyone throughout the world. Although this is a very broad statement, it is very interesting and one of his better points.
 One of the most intriguing aspects of Campbell's works is the fact that in traditional religions we tend to become trapped. We don't tend to have any actual discoveries, and insights into the deeper meaning of things. Campbell's ideas break down these walls. He offers new ways of viewing religions individually, and how they are connected to other religions.
 Another point that interested me in Campbell's words, is the fact that women are blamed for all the misfortunes of life. They are seen as the burden of man, and the reason for his suffering. Perhaps this started with Eve eating the forbidden fruit, which brought hardship and death to humans, but as Campbell points out, it is not only in the Christian faith that women are viewed this way. Quite a point to ponder.
 Overall, I would say that The Power of Myth is something worth taking the time to watch. It offers a break from the ordinary, and sort of refreshes your views on things, starting with basic human life, all the way up to religion. Joseph Campbell is the leader in mythology to date, and his views should be recognized.",1062979200,13,1772,4.7435064935064934
669761,4,6303503381,"A few days ago in my tenth grade world literature class, my teacher played The Power of Myth:  The Hero's Adventure for the class.  We had been studying Greek mythology and placing the traditional hero's quest in many stories and myths that we had read. In this video, Joseph Campbell, who was one of the world's leading experts on mythology of all types, discusses the hero's journey with reporter Bill Moyers.  The discussion is especially interesting because it takes place on the famous Skywalker Ranch, the home of George Lucas.  Moyers and Campbell return to the subject of Star Wars again and again in this interview to help explain the hero's quest in a well-known present-day setting.
 Although I found the contents of this video both stimulating and educational, I found that watching two people having a discussion about basically the same topic for over an hour was a bit tiring.  The point in the conversation that turned to the world that we live in was the most influential and meaningful to me.  Joseph Campbell tells that the intellectual and spiritual worlds are two very different ones.  This is an opinion that I both share and think many more people should share. Although I agree with that sentiment, when Campbell goes on to say that we are living in an economic, unspiritual world, I was very unsettled.  I agree that many people are very unspiritual in our world today, but this vast generalization is in my opinion an error within the video.
The subject matter within this video is extremely interesting to me, especially when Campbell tells of the reoccurring plots in many cultures' mythology.  I enjoyed this video because of its intellectual manner, but I found that a book related to this topic, Ishmael, by Daniel B. Quinn was even more moving, thought provoking, and entertaining than this film.  The fact that this book provides basically the same ideas in a story rather than an interview was why I enjoyed the book more than the movie, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a thoughtful, inspiring novel.",1062979200,3,2042,4.822349570200573
669762,3,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell's point of view in his movie ""The Hero's Adventure"" was a very new and interesting view to me.  His idea that everybody has some base in ancient mythology is unique, and I am able to agree with that somewhat.  The idea that everyone ""crosses the threshold"" is something I can see happening on a day-to-day basis.  Everyone has some kind of problems, and their problems could be considered their threshold, or ultimately, their ""supreme test.""
 It was also very interesting how almost all of the myths or stories with ""heroes"" in them, were alike in several different ways.  In all of the stories, the ""hero"" had some kind of challenge to face, a magical weapon of some sort, a journey, and someone to help them along their journey, such as a mentor. This may have something to do with the ""collective unconscious.""
I somewhat enjoyed the movie about the Hero's Quest, but at times the film seemed very dry.  The stories he told though were very intriguing.  I liked the way he made me realize that the character of Luke Skywalker in the movie ""Star Wars"", was the most basic example of a hero in mythology.  His challenge was just basically defending himself and saving others, his weapon was his light saber, his journey was the one he took to defeat the ""dark side"", and his mentor was Obi Wan Kanobi.
Overall, Campbell's movie was a good documentary.  It included many interesting facts about a man's view in our everyday society.",1062979200,3,1449,4.695652173913044
669763,4,6303503381,"I saw the first tape of the Power of Myth series last week in my tenth grade English class. We have been learning about myths for a few weeks and our teacher had mentioned Joseph Campbell in her lessons. She had said that he was and is considered the biggest authority on myths of all kinds.  He dedicated his life to them and finding ways to see how they were connected.  His work is very important to society and is portrayed very well in this tape.
At first the video didn't seem very interesting, just another boring lecture tape, but as I begin to watch and pay attention I became more interested in what was being said.  The more I watched the more I realized how much Joseph Campbell knew.  The way he thought about things and looked at what was going on around him was quite thought provoking.  Id never thought about how similar all the patterns and characters are in the stories of all our lives.  He has caused me to think in a slightly new and different way about the stories a read and the life I live.
 This is a very insightful and enjoyable video.  Joseph Campbell's thoughts and ideas about life based on his research are very interesting.  His conversations with Bill Moyers are entertaining and full of both humor and serious conversation.  After watching this video you will be left pondering its content long after it is over.  I would recommend that anyone who enjoys myths or just wants to see something that will make them think watch this video.",1062979200,2,1470,4.488721804511278
669764,3,6303503381,"I saw this video in 10th grade english.  Even though I am young I can still understand what Joseph Campbell is saying because he puts it in very simple terms.  He is a genius but is still able to put his thoughts into words that make sense to me.  That is what I like the best about this video.
Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth is a very descriptive vision of the smartest man ever in the mythology world.  He speaks of the most significant parts of myth and his beliefs on the world and many other facts of life through myth.  Bill Moyer brings out the best parts of Campbells mind in his questions.
Campbell talks about the collective unconscious throughout this interview.  It amazes me that people from all over the world can have the same ideas without even communicating with one another.  The idea of floods wiping out entire peoples and snakes being signs of evil being the same all over the world is pretty cool.  Collective unconscious is my favorite subject to listen to Campbell talk about because it shows that all people are connected in some ways.
Overall this DVD is o.k.  I am not a big mythology major but Joseph Campbell helps me to understand the deepest parts of the subject even though he is on a much higher level than I am.  It is not an action adventure though and is slow in some parts.",1062979200,,1317,4.382716049382716
669765,5,6303503381,"Since the first time I saw this marvellous program many years ago on PBS, I've never ceased to be amazed at the depth of spiritual insight which Joseph Campbell possessed. Though some of his assertions and conclusions I may not explicitly share, the fundamental core of his ""philosophy"" is unimpeachable for anyone who is detatched from ""names and forms,"" and is willing to go past their tradition's metaphors to attempt an unfettered appreciation of the ""Unknowable Essence.""

This video/DVD series is an utterly delightful exploration of the myths of various cultures -- an exploration whose aim is to uncover the meanings of and understand the metaphorical nature of those myths; an exploration which can enable seekers of truth and enlightenment to discover the key to the metaphors with which they have been nurtured on their own spiritual path, and enable each to realize that the Source of their tradition's metaphors is also the Source of those of other cultures.",1060819200,,971,5.1069182389937104
669908,5,6303503381,"In this remarkable series of tapes Joseph Campbell artfully summarizes his lifelong study of comparative religion and spirituality.  His insightful descriptions of religious archetypes, his engaging style and his choices of illustrative stories and examples will create a foundation for hours of thought for anyone involved in psychology, religion, philosophy and other fields.  I strongly recommend it even if it seems that watching 6 hours of interviews on comparative religion would put you into a deep sleep.  You won't want to miss a second.",1056240000,2,546,5.476190476190476
669909,5,6303503381,"I bought this item after reading the book, simply because I wanted to hear and see Joseph Campbell quote all of these pearls of wisdom. I feel like this purchase really enhanced my experience from the book.
Moyers delivers a wonderful narration and directs Campbell to disclose not only the extraordinary wealth and depth of knowledge that he possessed, but also summarize the really important stuff - how (in Campbell's view) should we view life? How should we view myth? What sort of approach should we take towards our religion? Our Faith?
I think the most important thing I was taught here was that the whole world pondered and still ponders over these questions, and answer them sometimes very similarly, and sometimes very differently. This gave me so much perspective in regards to my own set of beliefs and made me feel like I belong to an entire world that asks the very basic questions, over and over again.
If you are interested in myth, and are not afraid to open your mind to different points of view, do yourself a favor and sit down to watch this charming, sweet and admirable man talking about the most profound and fundamental topics ever discussed in such perfect balance between seriousness and humor.",1053907200,,1220,4.786729857819905
669910,5,6303503381,"1988: Joseph Campbell died in 1987. Two years earlier, then novice journalist Bill Moyers interviewed him for six hours, covering every subject imaginable. Joseph Campbell's philosophy paved the way for New Age thought today. His motto ""Follow your bliss"" became an anthem for individuality. He was a professor of mythology and religion, highly esteemed and intellectual, with a keen perception on human nature and the origins of many of the things that have become part of our consciousness as a human society.
This DVD features those six hours into two discs, plus the bonus footage of the interview with Star Wars creator, George Lucas, who was directly inspired and influenced by Joseph Campbell's teachings. From your DVD system will come a wealth of information, a bright new way to look at the world. Mythology in our society may become extinct, if not for new modern myths or variations of an old myth. Joseph Campbell covers a hero/heroine journey (clearly representing you or the self) in a path of discovery and exploration in the journey of your life in ""The Hero's Adventure"", recalling the great heroes of myth- the Norse Siegfried and his defeat of Falfner, King Arthur, Luke Skywalker and religious figures such as the Buddha and Jesus Christ- who overcame personal weaknesses and contributed to humanity a lasting legacy.
In ""The Message Of The Myth"", the observations on human life and nature are pointed out from several myths, and there is a lot Campbell draws from-  Native Americans, Japanese culture, the Mayas, the Vikings, the Africans and extractions from the Christian Bible. The ""First Storytellers"" deals with the primitive human society, cave-dwellers and hunters and gatherers, who told stories and painted images of their world through cave paintings. ""Sacrifice and Bliss"" deals with the higher level of spirituality, the chakras, the goal to which every hero/heroine aspires- sacrifice of the self to attain a bliss. Humanity benefits from such individuals.
My favorite sections are ""Love and the Goddess"" and ""Masks Of Eternity"". In ""Love and the Goddess"" Campbell explains to Moyers that love and our search for true, lasting monogamous love was fueled by the Christian-influenced troubadours and medieval knights who followed the code of chivalry. He makes reference to the Holy Grail and sounds a lot like New Age writer/historian Laurence Gardner who wrote ""Bloodline Of The Holy Grail""- the grail, a feminine symbol, becomes a code to which humans aspire, especially in communion with another partner for romantic love for the benefit of others. ""The Goddess"" is the most beautiful part of the entire series, nostalgically recalling a time when male sex did not dominate the world, but the mother figure. Egyptians and ancient Mesopotamians venerated the female, giver of life, and such respect was lost over time when patriarchal, male dominated society took over. This is still true today, although the Goddess has barely survived through such figures as the Virgin Mary. ""Masks Of Eternity"" centers around the various religions and the paths to that eternal that is time, neither being right or wrong, each a mask of the same life force of the cosmos- eternity.
This DVD is a must get for fans of Joseph Campbell and for those who wish to seek a deeper level of understanding about myths and fairy tales, which have more to say than meets the eye.",1048723200,7,3390,5.086175942549372
669911,5,6303503381,"I see a number of people have already written good extensive reviews, so I won't cover the same ground.
THIS is my most watched DVD. It is amazing the spiritual convergence of varied cultures looking back on what they have left. And it's 'no wonder' why things are the way they are now, because of some of the elements of culture we have given up. What would kids turning into adults be like if we had modern rituals to mark leaving childhood and NOW being adults. (How different would I be? Or You?) Myths were often attempts to explain how we happened to be, where we came from, but also how we should be Now.
On a technical level, I liked that the programs on the dvd would play in order. I have a few collected dvd's where, after each program is completed, the dvd goes back to the menu and awaits instructions. Keep the learning going. Keep the experience going.",1045180800,,867,4.391304347826087
669912,1,6303503381,"I hate to go against the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this series; but if I am to speak my mind, I shall have to do just that. When the series first aired on PBS, I offered a college course on Campbell's work on mythology.  We studied the books, especially The Hero With A Thousand Faces and The Masks of God.  Campbell's scholarship has a chip on its shoulder.  Joe had an ax to grind against western culture and western religions, especially against Judaism and Christianity. If you pay close attention, you will hear Joe making negative comments about Judaism and Christianity in the programs.  Moyers tries to object but he is no match for this master of sophistry. He says he finds the western religions ""too negative"" because they recognize an irreducible dimension of evil which is introduced into the world by free will gone wrong.  Campbell is a professed Gnostic, someone who thinks evil is just another dimension of reality and therefore necessary to reality.  He refuses to distinguish pain and suffering which are natural from moral wrong doing which is not.  Moreover Campbell is hostile to the western philosophical tradition and denigrates the Greek notion of nous or intelligence which ironically he himself seems unaware he is trying to display in his exuberant retelling and reinterpreting  of traditional religious myths albeit for his own purposes. He puts himself in the odd position of being an anti-intellectual intellectual.  This is not uncommon for Gnostics.
If you want to see the difference between a Gnostic view of reality and the philosophical or Western religious view, then consider how different Spielberg's treatment of evil in Schlindler's List is from Lucas's treatment of it in the Star Wars series.  In the former it cannot be tolerated and must be eliminated; in the latter it is just the ""dark side"" of reality.  These views are incompatible.  Either one or both are mistaken.  I think the Gnostic view is mistaken because it by-passes responsibility and allows the perpetration of horrible crimes and even justifies the latter.
  Each interpreter must decide for themselves, but I believe Campbell is a very dangerous proponent of Gnostic views precisely because he is so rhetorically seductive. I am not surprised that many people today find his work and his views enlightening.  But I could say what Leo Strauss, a cantankerous old scholar with impeccable credentials and a body of work more impressive than Campbell's by a long shot said about the European Enlightenment: Campbell's work represents a lucus a non lucendo.",1020124800,112,2573,5.061611374407583
669913,5,6303503381,"The problem with studying philosophy is that it gives a lot of theories, tears down a lot of ideas, and teaches you to ask a lot of questions.  The problem arises when one wants the answers to those questions.  The wrong answer is, ""Don't ask those questions anymore.""  That is the answer of Analytic Philosophy.  Since (the last time I checked) they hold sway in the philosophical community - I've left current philosophy behind.  Joseph Campbell, on the other hand, demands that we ask those questions and (through his works) will act as a mentor for us to finding the answers.
The answers not only can be found, but they have ALWAYS been there - and they are revealed through religion and mythology.  Campbell, who spent his life studying the religions of the world, will say that ""All religions are the same and all religions are true!""  He says, in order to find the inherent truth in the religion, one must look for the MEANING behind the METAPHOR and give that priority over the actual nuts and bolts of one's religion (like the way Christ criticized the Pharisees for following ""the Letter of the Law, but not the Spirit of the Law."").  The myths act as a guide through life - they tell us what to do, what not to do, what to believe, and what values to hold.  It is important because, much of Campbell's advice goes against popular wisdom.  ""Follow your bliss,"" not ""try to make money.""  If you don't do want you want to do...if you don't risk anything and do what you think you are SUPPOSED to do, you probably won't be a very happy person.
The emphasis is definitely on the practical application of the myth, as embodied by all the cultures of the world.  To that end, Campbell's favorite subject is The Hero.  All the heroes of mythology have certain characteristics and, from them, we learn to live our lives.  It is well known that George Lucas was a disciple of his and Star Wars owes much to Campbell.  It is only fitting that Campbell (in these interviews) talks about Star Wars and how it embodies these myths for a new generation.  There is also a bonus interview on the DVD with Lucas, discussing mythology and Campbell.
I haven't read any of Campbell's books yet, but after watching this series, I intend to do so.",1019433600,15,2235,4.5361596009975065

669915,5,6303503381,"Joseph Campbell has quite a unique spot in the world of philosophers and scholars.  This collection of videos provides the most accessible view of Joseph Campbell's contribution to modern thought.  Inspired by psychology, religion, anthropology, poetry, and most importantly, mythology, Joseph Campbell set out to teach the world to seek their spot in the world alive with magic and myth.  ""Follow Your Dream"" is the resounding message of his philosophy, not some intellectually dull and world negating philosophy that is only understandable to philosophy professors.
Bill Moyers does a decent job of presenting Joseph Campbell in these videos, though his questions are sometimes banal and ethnocentric.  This may work to the viewers advantage however, for we get to see Joseph Campbell explain the joy and the wonder of life in many different aspects.  The series expands to speak of love, ancient religions, and the mythologies of all corners of life.  The deities of the Greeks, Celts, Native Americans, Indians and more are all discussed in the context of their importance to the human relationship to the divine.
The advantage of these videos is to actually see and hear Joseph Campbell, whose attitude is refreshingly energetic and joyful.  You can see and hear the enthusiasm and love he has for his work and humankind.  These videos will expand your mind in a way that it never has, and it does it simply and effectively.",1013644800,15,1429,5.103004291845494

669917,5,6303503381,"When I first watched the Moyers-Campbell exchange in the early 1990s on PBS, I understood very little of what Campbell said. I was still ""seeing"" myths, etc. from the ""disciplined"" perspectives of religion or science (psychology, structural anthropology, etc.) and I tried to fit his comments into ""my"" world view.
I have just finished rewatching the DVD version of these taped interviews, and I now understand more of what Campbell is saying. I've been watching this series with another person who is ""searching"" and he keeps saying ""I don't get that.""  I want to help him ""get it"" and I sometimes feel I must appear like Burt Reynolds in one of his films where he took a ""New Age"" course and rolled on the floor and said ""I've got it!!"" Campbell says, when you think you've got it you haven't. So all I can say is--I feel I've got something more than I had.
Campbell says human beings will die for a metaphor. We are like the 10 blind men with the elephant--each with a part of the whole, interpreting it through our cultural spectacles. And many of us will die for our interpretation of what ""God"" is.  Even the word ""God"" is connotive of a belief system. One has only to look at the ideological conflicts the world over to see the results of differing world views. And, it isn't just ""religion"" either. Beliefs systems underlie economic behaviour as well. Everyone has a belief system--the alternative is madness, which is probably yet another belief system of some sort.
For those raised in a religious tradition (most of us) the notion of giving up the idea of a personal god is painful. And yet, Campbell says one must give up this idea--and that is all it is--an idea. Something you have conceived and believe. Think about it -- ""personal god"" -- the divine as interpreted by a human (person). Who can do that??
Our metaphors (idea of the divine) form the organizing priciples we address through myths. These myths are the communal poetry of our group, and do what plain old language cannot --approach the divine. Still, singly they fall short.
Campbell compiled and studied myths from around the world and he said these myths reflect the human experience of the divine--or whatever you want to call IT. Of course, I can hear my old anthropology professor saying you cannot lift a ""myth"" like a sack of flour. The best any of us can do regarding other people's myths is interpret them via our own myths.
At any rate, Campbell has studied myths and seems to think they are like the many strands of fiber in a tapestry--each reflecting a particular aspect of an attribute of the divine and togther they form a whole cloth. He says these reflections or threads and even the cloth should not be confused with the ""thing that stands behind.""
By what authoritiy does any of us call another's religion ""savage"" ""backward"" ""barbaric"" or worse? Oh I admit, I find some ""old time"" religions pretty scary and some modern ones too. Campbell says we should not judge...but it is hard not to judge, and if I judge, I use my own interpretation of what is true and good for me.
Campbell was not a religious man at the end of his life, although he began life as a Roman Catholic. One might describe him as a spiritual man. He seems to have believed in a higher power or a divine--something. I think he felt it permeated everything and belonged to everyone and to no one and that no human could fully apprehend it. Bill Moyers (Southern Baptist) says his faith was strengthened by his exchanges with Campbell but in watching the two men on these tapes I have had the impression Campbell was talking past Moyers at times. Moyers still believed in a personal God. Such is the nature of faith in metaphors.",1005955200,212,3693,4.6109422492401215
