without them, well I'd just be listening to a great blues guitarist",1378166400,,145,4.407407407407407
8104194,5,B000E1OIDU,"This is an excellent instructional dvd with stories about Mr. Jackson's life. For anyone but an advanced guitar player, the material that is slowed down and zoomed-in on is too difficult to pick up, save ""Louis Collins""; this particular tune can, indeed, serve as an introduction to Blues fingerpicking. Jackson messes up, leaves out or mumbles lyrics on many occasions, but this is acceptable due to his great stories about John Hurt, Skip James and Mance Lipscomb, whom he refers to as ""Nance Lister"". John comes across as a very cordial man who is capable of playing in the styles of Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller (though with a different type of guitar than Fuller played), and Josh White. I look forward to picking up the new Jackson dvd from guitarvideos.com, and recommend ""The Fingerpicking Blues of John Jackson"" to everyone.",1232841600,,834,4.921985815602837
