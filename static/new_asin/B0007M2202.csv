2219481,2,B0007M2202,"I watched episode 8, ""Monopoly Men,"" and was appalled at how poorly the evidence was laid out. Yes, the Federal Reserve Bank is a titanic con. Yes, the Jekyll Island meeting of 1908 was a criminal conspiracy. But watching this show, you'd be hard pressed to see the evidence presented as credible. No-name nobodies with no credibility sounding off is how this comes across. Very much a disservice to genuinely important ideas that need to be heard by wide audiences.

Won't be sampling any other episodes.",1480896000,5,505,4.872093023255814
2219482,4,B0007M2202,I never understood why this series got so overlooked. It's well produced even if the production values really do belong to the 90's. Dean Stockwell is always a good presence.,1379203200,5,174,4.833333333333333
2219483,5,B0007M2202,"They tend to make inferences that can't be 100% proven as fact, but it's nice to get some real information. I love Dean Stockwell. What an added bonus to a great collection of information. I highly recommend these movies even if you are just looking for entertainment.",1318377600,7,268,4.723404255319149
2219484,4,B0007M2202,"I got the six pack of them. I rate them all the same. Eye opening information, very well done.
Only wish they would release the one with Nikola Tesla's stuff. Seen it online and years ago on TV. The man was a genus, I feel smarter then Albert Einstein, a genus in his own right.",1306022400,7,278,4.072727272727272
2219495,1,B0007M2202,"Hokey, cheesy, eye roll worthy. Some of the information is accurate, but it's presented in such an overly dramatic, sensationalized fashion that it is hard to take seriously. I'm sure glad I sampled it free with Prime. I would have been very angry if I had paid to watch this.",1499040000,,276,4.54
2219496,1,B0007M2202,"About 10% of HAARP was technically enlightening, The other 90% is emotionally based opinion that too many folks would readily accept as fact.  i would expect to see this nonsense on Fox News",1498435200,2,190,4.757575757575758
2219497,4,B0007M2202,"I found most of these episodes depressing as they place our local, state and especially our federal governments in a very bad light. Multiple instances of cover-ups. Especially in episode 6 ""heavy Watergate; covering up cold fusion"". The music was so loud in this episode thai it is hart to hear what is being said but it is horrible that clean, safe energy is accessible but not being promoted because the huge oil companies have the money to buy the lobbyist to block these bills from being passed. They don't even get to become bills due to the so called scientists who are also paid by big oil companies to ridicule these new methods of making clean energy. Federal government pretends to be concerned about clean air and pollution but will never do anything about fixing the problem because politicians get kick backs for blocking any bills that would be beneficial to the public. This episode makes it very clear if you can understand many of the heavy foreign accents over the very loud music.",1498348800,6,1000,4.72
2219498,4,B0007M2202,"Just to be clear -- there are 14 episodes in this series, but only ONE of them is about Tesla.  The rest are unrelated tales about weird and/or unexplained events.  It looks at H.A.A.R.P.; it looks at LOST American atomic weapons; it looks at what purports to be the remains of Noah's Ark, etc.  If you love weirdness and/or conspiracy theories, you'll enjoy this series. .",1497225600,4,373,4.621212121212121
2219499,4,B0007M2202,"Excellent shows to watch, very interesting. Some data is out of date, but that's to be expected. Things I might question I look up online to verify. Many show hoe science has become a real religion unto itself, and how many are right out liars (for the right price). Which is even more evident today.

If you like history, which is often stranger than fiction, I think you will like these.",1496275200,4,389,4.47887323943662
2219500,1,B0007M2202,Why are all the earliest reviews always 5 stars?  Does anyone else wonder about that?  These terrible series always start out with a few 5 star reviews no matter how bad they are - like this one.  NOT recommended.  At all.,1494547200,2,222,4.341463414634147
2219501,5,B0007M2202,"A huge fan of the genre, I can't imagine how I missed this series the first time around. While most of the topics were familiar to me, now, nearly twenty years later and knowing the world situation as it stands today, I found the information almost shocking. I can't imagine how we, as a country and a species missed this the first time around! The lens of hindsight focuses a hard look at the costs of ignorance and inactivity. In other words, we were warned.
Terrifically informative and insightful.",1493164800,5,501,4.640449438202247
2219502,1,B0007M2202,Anyone that the Tesla fan go to the Freedom of Information Act and download anything you can find from Tesla on the CIA or FBI I have 240 page document from someone's name that's blacked out to J Edgar Hoover. Which states that Tesla's work is real and that they must get it before it falls into an enemy's hands this was in 1940 he died in 41 it even has descriptions of all the Future Weapons the earthquake machine the death ray it's all there free to download,1488412800,2,463,4.213483146067416
2219503,1,B0007M2202,"apologize ahead of time as I only watched the cold fusion episode which proceeded to slam everyone denouncing the results of Pons and Fleischmann as part of a vast conspiracy to bury the research to preserve precious research dollars for hot fusion research. This program presented itself as outing the disgraceful actions of so many governments and scientists; however, knowing the end result of all of this I couldn't finish it. Then looking over other episodes I couldn't believe my eyes as I see a later episode brings up this very subject ranking it with the likes of the Piltdown man scam. If you like documentaries you might want to pass on this; however, if you believe that our government has been doing massive testing to attempt and control the earths weather or that Nikola Tesla made some amazing discovery that could solve our planets energy problems if we could only re-create it this is for you. If you believe we have been in contact with aliens and have been reverse engineering their technology this will probably make you very happy.",1487808000,4,1053,4.823204419889502
2219504,5,B0007M2202,"Despite the cheesy music and rather ridiculous recreations, this series is not half bad at all. It provides a unique perspective on certain events that ""Conspiracy Theorists"" [in some cases, highly respected Scientists] are still bringing into question even today. Though the series was filmed almost twenty years ago, it offers viewers a rare insight which allows for some of the information to be validated or invalidated in regard to some of the ""theories"" proposed. One example of this being, HAARP.  Viewers get to catch a glimpse of the information and intentions of these projects made available to the public back then and compare it to the information available today. With that, any discrepancies within that information can be located and identified.. In some cases, deepening the mysteries EVEN MORE.",1486857600,3,812,5.246153846153846
2219511,1,B0007M2202,This show is so bad on so many levels. The volume jumps vastly when scenes change. It's not assembled in a fascinating way at all. It's just pieces of footage strung together with occasional narration and interview shots.,1483488000,,221,4.842105263157895

2219514,1,B0007M2202,"This ""documentary"" is total garbage.  It's outright fiction in the spirit of any Michael Moore ""documentary"" (with the possible exception of Roger and Me).  I watched the episode on HAARP and it was the worst tinfoil-hat junk that you could ever imagine.  The factual errors alone completely disqualify it from the genre of ""documentary"".  One example:  they state that the weather is getting worse and there are more natural disasters now than ever before.  Excuse me?  The last hurricane to hit the United States was Hurricane Wilma in 2005.  Compare that with the 1970s and 80s.

2219517,2,B0007M2202,Production values are poor. Barely audible narration interspersed with very audible interviews/commentaries. Narration is overpowered by not so great music. Too bad.,1481760000,,165,6.545454545454546
2219518,1,B0007M2202,"The Phenomenon of fake news and over the top conspiracy theories is not new. No better proof than this poorly edited series of bunk. Most of the material is not original. Rather it is gathered from a number of other fake science and conspiracy programs, thus explaining the ever shifting narrators. My guess is that Dean Stockwell did all of his work in one day, collected the paycheck, and never saw the result. The beginning of each episode is classic, however. ""...lost archives from the secret government."" LOL.",1481673600,5,515,4.863636363636363
2219519,2,B0007M2202,"Perhaps the best summary is one of the opening lines where they claim the show is based upon a ""recently discovered repository, classified by the secret government"". Read that again. Not ""classified by THE government"" but classified by ""the SECRET government"". If that doesn't set off alarm bells, then I have some ocean-front property in Arizona with the Brooklyn Bridge on it that I'll make you a really good deal on! In their discussion of the Savannah bomb, they even get the wrong date... only by one day, but still. Talking about jettisoned or lost bombs they repeatedly refer to them as being ""armed"" and they show images of atomic weapon detonations, but the bombs are only armed right before dropping them as war shots, weapons jettisoned or lost in a crash would not normally be armed and would NOT detonate.

They talk about the 24x7 airborne nuclear strike force as if it was some great secret, hidden from the American people, when in fact it the knowledge of the existence of this force (while not it's strength) was a major element of the concept of nuclear deterrence. There were contemporary movies about it for crying out loud! ""Strategic Air Command"" came out in 1955, ""Bombers B-52"" in 1957, the iconic ""Fail Safe"" came out in 1964. They go on to claim that SAC operated with almost ""total autonomy"" which is flatly untrue. US Nuclear forces have always acted under a system of ""positive control"" requiring the President to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. It took this show less than 8 minutes into the first episode to totally discredit itself as anything more than conspiracy theory and fake news.",1481587200,9,1625,4.803571428571429
2219520,3,B0007M2202,People leaving reviews should realize that this series was produced in 1998.  You can't expect 2016 quality from a 1998 production.  The music while a little annoying isn't bad enough to keep me from watching.  I find the series to be very though provoking and have learned quite a few things that I want to do more reading on.  There are things in this series that happened before I was born and were not covered in high school history.  Give it a chance.  Just remember it was produced almost 20 years ago.,1481241600,12,508,4.467391304347826
8048686,5,B0007M2202,"This is a very heroic series that boldly tackled subjects no one had dared to do before or after, like questioning the legitimacy of the Federal Reserve System.  The show was made on a tight budget but was able to leverage its resources and deliver a very powerful peek into how the World actually works behind the veil of what we now call ""Fake News"".  An important milestone, especially from our current perspective!",1523491200,,418,4.712328767123288

8048690,5,B0007M2202,"okay, like some reviewers have said, the music is terrible. Yes, and not just the music, but how it is used in the show is completely inappropriate. I feel like the producers of this show had little experience. That being said, the subjects of the show and writing are great. The first episode alone about the US loosing nukes pretty much all over the world blew my mind. Great stuff if you like unexplained, conspiracy type shows. Plus it has Dean Stockwell.",1511913600,,459,4.609756097560975
8048691,5,B0007M2202,This episode of Phenomenon is meticulously written and the ideas are explored in an informed and thought provoking manner.  Who could have believed that so many nuclear weapons would have been lost?  It's terrifying.,1511308800,,216,5.323529411764706

8048693,1,B0007M2202,"Probably the worst conspiracy series ever produced.  Betraying its title, ""Phenomenon: The Lost Archives"" has very, very little to do with phenomena of any kind.  Instead, this is a mash-up of yawn-inducing, recycled anti-government conspiracy theories, jabbing its finger in the eye of every presidential administration of the 20th Century, I think.  Everything you can imagine is a sinister government plot, according to this program.  Really absurd writing, dreadful editing, awful stock footage, terrible sound quality, and possibly the worst musical soundtrack of all time.  It's easy to see why this series was mercifully tossed into the dustbin of television rejects long ago.  I'm sure that host Dean Stockwell and narrator Martin Sheen would love to forget it.",1508544000,,769,5.47457627118644
8048694,5,B0007M2202,"It's just my opinion, but I think this series is great. Well researched and presented. I must also disagree with some of the other reviewers, the opening theme music is Awesome! Not to mention, Dean Stockwell is always super-cool. I definitely recommend giving episode 1 a try at the very least. PEACE!",1506816000,3,302,4.826923076923077
8048695,3,B0007M2202,"Interesting episodes but about 90 percent of it is bull crap. I wonder how much Dean Stockwell, the host, got paid from the tobacco companies to smoke his stogey on camera. I do believe the episode about the U. S. govt. stealing his research when he died and the developement of his, ""death ray,"" and free power for everyone from the atmosphere. I also believe that if the electric power built up enough in the upper atmosphere we would have had catastrophic weather and it could have caused a global firestorm. I also believe that at least the U.S. govt and possibly two more have directed energy weapons and possibly missiles in space despite the treaty not to put weapons there. The reason is because of Tesla's work and the fact hardly anything has been in the media about space weapons since President  Reagan's SDI(Star Wars) plan.",1501459200,2,837,4.6938775510204085
