2921732,5,B000UGWACK,"As anyone can see by watching the preview available on the Amazon page for this item, not only did this cartoon have an awesome rock meets synthesizer theme song and music, but the animation is great as well.  If you grew up watching Exosquad, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Conan the Adventurer, the 90s Batman/x-men/spiderman animated series, etc. then this is a must have.  Saturday morning cartoons - and kids shows in general - never looked as good as they did in the early 90s, and this is a prime example.  Up until now, only the first 5 episodes of this forgotten gem were available on dvd.  Now you can get the whole series - over 9 hours worth of awesome 90s animation - for $14.99!!! Every time I hear the theme song (since I grew up watching it to present day as a 24 year old) it still pumps me up.",1268265600,33,805,4.346666666666667
2921733,5,B000UGWACK,I wish I could find the whole series.  Unfortunately this is just a teaser of the begining eps. ;~),1222819200,2,99,4.2105263157894735

2921735,2,B000UGWACK,"I'm honestly not sure if this is an officially licensed product due to the quality of the packaging (*poor* cover print quality) and what seems to be a set of DVD-/+R discs (at least that's what it looks like when I see the purple/pink coloured discs that have been used). They play fine and the video/audio quality is good enough, but the aforementioned ""issues"" left me quite disappointed.",1466467200,2,391,4.764705882352941

2921738,4,B000UGWACK,Really like the setup and the story. Only bad part is that is ends with out an ending.,1462838400,,86,3.8333333333333335
2921739,5,B000UGWACK,"Yes, we've all heard the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, but I doubt you've seen it told like this! When Arthur and the knights go missing, Merlin has to search across time and space for temporary replacements. Ultimately, he chooses an American football team, of all things, as substitute champions. Armed with the magic weapons and armor of their counterparts, they will lead the fight for justice against the armies of Morgan le Fay and the traitorous knight Sir Mordred, as well as searching for the twelve magic keys that will free their counterparts and send them home.

Most of you have never heard of this series, and that's a great pity. There are a few reasons why it's so obscure. First, the market for Saturday morning cartoons in the late 1980's and early 90's was over-saturated with material, and the hidden gems (like this one) were simply lost in the shuffle. Second, Cable TV wasn't as well distributed in 1992 as it is now. Most networks were still local, and, if they picked a show up at all, they would usually show only one or two episodes to see how well the public reacted, then pull the plug.

This series deservedly belongs in any animation lover's (Western or otherwise) library. The animation is crisp and well-made, the voice acting and music is top-notch ( particularly the kick-@$$ intro theme), and the writing is believable. Also included on the DVD is the rarely seen second season, which never aired in the US. Now, mount up, knights! There's a day to save!",1460246400,4,1517,4.677902621722846
2921740,4,B000UGWACK,"Loved King Arthur and the Knights of Justice back when I was a kid...
Adding it to my collection and rewatching the series, it was nostalgic.
My only two problems was the fact a) you could tell quality differences between the original ""season"" vs the following; the original was smoother, in my opinion. b) the series was cut short of it's expected life, considering the sort of story they had going. You never get to see what becomes of the boys who take part in the great legend, or what happens to the actual King Arthur...
Those two points aside...great and wonderful to add to a collection.",1457136000,,595,4.570093457943925

2921791,4,B000UGWACK,"This is it the complete series of king arthur and the knights of justice. Used to air in the 90s as a sunday morning cartoon. Something about the sunday morning cartoons were great. under rated and relatively unknown compare to sat morn ones. This one has all the action and magic and team work you'd expect from the 80s and 90s style of toy based animated shows. Although I don't believe the toy line did very well there is a fan base for this show. If your like me and got excited when this appered on netflix then sad when they removed it you'll want to pick this up. Good show for any age boy or girl although no strong female roles here, this is based on a football team going back in time so it's pretty male dominated action. There is a nice princess in distress
character though but she gets no super suit or transforming sequence.",1340323200,,839,4.3164556962025316
2921792,3,B000UGWACK,"This cartoon show was targeted for toys rather than any resemblence of alternate history.

2921795,5,B000UGWACK,This was an amazing purchase for the cost. The show was exactly as I remembered. Cheesy but with a positive plot. I only wish that it would be picked up by a studio and finished. The show added that right amount of action and fantasy with the reinforcement of common values that are missing for many of today's youth in shows like Sponge Bob.,1318464000,,342,4.359375
2921796,4,B000UGWACK,"Not much too say. The soundtrack was an awesome rock mix, the story wasn't too compelling but somewhat original. The same sequence was used in every episode for the knights putting on their magical armor but otherwise this was a great show for simple action, cool magic, knight battles (although 9 knights could always seem to overwhelm hordes of ""warlords"", hmm...). Was a nice walk down memory lane and the recording quality was the best I could expect from the original. If you liked the show when it aired you'll likely find a good price to reminisce with this one.",1307404800,4,569,4.7

2921798,4,B000UGWACK,"Its a great cartoon, takes me way back when watched it as a kid. Its too bad it was discontinued. I wanted to know how it ends when the knights find all keys of truth and free the true King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Other than that, its very well animated. Cartoons never looked better. Plus the intro rocks, and the story line was good. But if only the story had really ended complete sending the knights back home and the real king takeing back his throne.",1302652800,,475,4.230769230769231
2921799,5,B000UGWACK,All of the old episodes are here. This is one of my favorite shows from childhood.

You won't be disappointed.,1294185600,,266,3.8545454545454545
2921800,5,B000UGWACK,"Great show with rich character. My 9yr old says, ""I love it! Awesome show!! I want to watch it everyday!! It teaches you to believe in yourself and teamwork. Also teaches you to be a good person by showing you how to help others and be respectful."" Awesome for me!
Children shows of today lack the display of character. Most are just about having fun and a lot of selfishness before a quickly forgotten, subtle lesson. Less about getting into a lot of trouble and saying sorry, More about overcoming the obstacles in the way of doing something good, Especially when it's you. This show follows a football team having fun via the adventure that life, and time travel, brings in just trying to do what's right. Even with the magic aspect that's a little beyond reality the show provides the role model of an eager-to-always-improve hero. Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Thundercats, Ducktales. If my sons going to look up to a fictional character, I rather it be King Arthur than a sponge.
There is a wide array of things to attribute to who I am today, and the values in characters I looked up to in entertainment as a child definitely played a role. With that said, I'm glad that I can comfortably let my son watch a show knowing that it shares the same character building values I try to teach him myself.",1293926400,11,1318,4.588983050847458
2921801,4,B000UGWACK,I grew up with this show. So to finally have the whole series made me extremely happy. Cant complain here. No special menus no extra content. Just 3 discs of king arthur and the knights of justice. All the episodes nothing is missing. I would recommend this to anyone. Great show. Waiting hopefully for the bluray version.,1289692800,10,322,4.666666666666667
2921802,4,B000UGWACK,if you followed the cartoon series then you know that each knight needs a key of truth in order to return to their time period the cartoon series didn't finish it if the cartoon series was on longer  it might had been possible i do like the series i feel that the show should had a season finale with episodes having all the remaining keys of truth collected,1285113600,,358,4.264705882352941
2921803,1,B000UGWACK,"I remembered how much I loved this cartoon when I was younger so I bought it but it turned out to really just suck real bad now that I'm older. Its just really corny and the episodes are ridiculous. Also, the fighting scenes are stupid, even for an old cartoon. I had to force myself to finish it.

Not a great purchase. Buy the new He-man series that aired on cartoon network which they sell here. That was REAL good; wish the continued it.",1284163200,7,441,4.25
2921804,3,B000UGWACK,"I really liked this show as a kid and I'm glad it finally gets a complete release with all the episodes.  I have both the DVD releases: the first DVD release [which was a partial release with only five episodes] and this complete DVD release.  Unfortunately, episode #5 in this complete DVD release is flawed because it's missing all background music throughout the episode [except the opening intro].  I compared this to the first DVD release which doesn't have this flaw.  You can also check out this YouTube version of episode #5 which came from the first DVD release and you can see it is supposed to have music...

[...]

Hopefully, someone can contact the company who released this DVD and have them fix it and re-release it and give a free replacement for customers that bought this flawed one.  This is a great show and deserves a proper release.

2921809,4,B000UGWACK,"King Arthur and the Knights of Justice takes place entirely in Medieval times, despite the heroes being football players from the future. Gladly, they're down to earth and eager to help those in danger. The animation is great for a Saturday cartoon, the quality of picture very good, and the series is very long and well worth the low price.

It's an entertaining show, but if you're looking for deep storylines, you might not find it here, though you will find plenty of action in each episode, whether on horseback or on foot, there's plenty of sword clashing throughout the entire series. The armored Knight costumes are well designed, with plenty of variety whether on the side of good fighting for Camelot, or evil, fighting for Morgana. Merlin is the guide, and he uses his magic to help them find the lost keys, to help them get back to their world (Think Dungeons and Dragons). There's also dragons, animals and monsters that make appearances.

Overall, great show on DVD thanks to IMAGE, just needed a bit more plot to earn a 5. Three DVD's each with about 8 episodes each, for about 27 total, each about 24 minutes or so. Recommended. Series was made 1993, but definitely has an 80's feel to it (a good thing).",1273795200,33,1220,4.643518518518518

I think it's one of the best cartoon that mixes action and story evenly and appropriately. I feel like cartoons of this quality are not made anymore. Since its an older cartoon, the graphics aren't perfect but I never noticed as child. The imperfections aren't a big deal to me because the overall quality of the series trumped that.

I had the hardest time receiving my order and the DVD box was a little bit damage. I didn't want to send it back for a good copy because I was afraid I'd never see it again. Another buyer of this product got their DVD in perfect condition and in a timely manner. So I have no idea what happened to mine?

I completely recommend it to anyone since its a really good price!",1269820800,3,795,4.401360544217687
2921811,5,B000UGWACK,I remember watching this when I was a kid. So I purchased this for my 10 year old nephew. He loves it.,1269475200,,102,3.6818181818181817
2921812,4,B000UGWACK,This was overall a good show to watch. The only thing that's missing is a ''true ending'' to it and to me not really a complete series without it. To be ''complete'' the real King Arthur and his Knights need to be set free from Morgana and the replacement King Arthur and his Knights of Justice need to be sent back from the time Merlin got them from. Since there's no real bad violence in it it's good to watch with older kids.,1268438400,4,428,4.168674698795181

8213271,4,B000UGWACK,The show is awesome. The transfer to dvd is pretty good too except for like 2 episodes which show the channels logo in the title safe area. Those episodes looked a bit fuzzy too. But the rest were great. I heard the actual final episode is the super nintendo game which i still haven't played but will. I would wake up early (when i was a kid) on Sundays just to watch this. Buy it if you're a fan!,1485129600,2,398,4.050632911392405
