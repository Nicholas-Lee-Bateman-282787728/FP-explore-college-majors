8357805,5,B0029JIM0U,Been trying to find this show for a long time. This show my child what it was like when i was a kid. The kids that i grow up with and myself use to have are own gang and tried hard to find a crime but never could so we made up are own. If you remember the 70's then this show will bring back a time long gone. Can not get shows like this today. This show should be remade in a movie or a t.v show again. Great story's.,1389398400,3,418,3.6043956043956045
8357806,5,B0029JIM0U,"It was really amazing to recreate again this wonderful show, I only had vague memories on the back of my head when The Red Hand Gang was broadcasted back in 1978 or 1979 and I was a kid of that age (8 or 9), and my friends and I pretended we were the Red Hand Gang and rode on bycicle, skates, and it was a magical world, pretty different of all the games I sense kids are now into. When I discovered this DVD I couldn't help but buying it and it was worth every penny, so sad it didn't last that long but what I have now is solid gold.",1330387200,2,536,3.8378378378378377
8357807,5,B0029JIM0U,"This show was great in the 1970s, and it is still great now. It is timeless. I enjoyed buying it to see it again. I remember growing up and watching it back in the 1970s. Brought back clear childhood memories.",1289692800,2,209,4.25
8357808,5,B0029JIM0U,"This is classic 70's kids tv.  Unlike most kids tv shows, this one was made up of 'serialized adventures' that were continued, week-to-week.  So you had to make sure you did't miss an episode.  Great fun watching this show again!  :)",1286496000,2,233,4.609756097560975
