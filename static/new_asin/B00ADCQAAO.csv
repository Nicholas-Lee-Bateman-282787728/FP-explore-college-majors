The visual component of the video is amazing with great scenery and ambiance.

Greg is an excellent host making his commentary interesting and insightful. He provides the viewer with great tips on locations, hotels, restaurants as well as nightlife.

As I'm planning a trip to Asia in the near future, after watching the dvd I felt that I've pretty much sorted out my itinerary.

A wonderful video to watch and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's planning a trip to Asia.",1364169600,,554,4.8

I have my itinerary all planned out now thanks to this video; from where to visit to what I should eat.
This video also gives you a little experience to what a Chinese wedding is like in Taiwan.
Can't wait until I get my hands on one of those authentic bubble tea drinks! :)",1359936000,,386,4.16
8676852,5,B00ADCQAAO,"If you've ever thought about backpacking throughout Asia or taking a multi city trip, perhaps to learn more about your Asian heritage, this Blue-ray is well worth a watch.  I'm planning to take a trip to Asia shortly and it certainly got me excited and in the mood for the upcoming trip.

Greg, the host, provides a very fresh, hip perspective which I think other 20-30 some olds will appreciate.  The video footage is almost as stunning as the destinations themselves.  Greg has managed to use his passion for travel to find and share some of the best locations and restaurants in each city.  Found it highly entertaining, from the beginning to the end.

You won't be disappointed if you purchase it.",1359244800,,701,4.704918032786885
