1879734,2,B000096IA4,"I have the uncut Euro version of 99 Women and have seen Barbed Wire Dolls, and this is his worst women in prison film. Ursula Fellner is this movies' only saving grace. Blue Underground did their usual good job on the transfer to DVD. There were no surprises here. I thought that the sex was somewhat muted in comparison to the other films I had already mentioned. Probably an OK rental but that is about it. Charlie S.",1178928000,2,419,4.384615384615385
1879735,2,B000096IA4,"OK, no one will confuse this with Citizen Kane but you've got to love a movie where the women are always topless. There are a few catfights and some kinky sex as well. On the other hand I hope they didn't overpay the guy who wrote the dialogue. Here's a prime example. After one of the captive girls dies:

""This is terrible. It reminds me of the day Zenobia died""

""A relative?""

""No, my favorite cow.""

 I guess they saved some money on the script and blew it on great special effects like that plastic crocodile. I will say that it took me three sittings to make it through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I guess that's what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope the folks waiting to rent it next didn't get too impatient. Don't worry folks, it's on it's way.",1113264000,8,796,4.245033112582782
1879736,1,B000096IA4,"This movie was a major disappointment.  The plot is awful.  The dialogue stinks.  The camera-work is amateurish, even by b-movie sleaze standards.  It's poorly lit.  The acting is terrible, and most of the actresses are in fact ugly slags.  There is a lot of nudity, but don't expect to be aroused by it.  The people who made this did not put much effort into it at all and it shows.  I guess they figured that nudity + perversion was a big enough selling point, and that they could lazily toss the rest of the movie together in a slapdash manner.  Unfortunately, this movie does not even excel on the nudity and perversion front, except for perhaps the odd fellow who has a thing for trannies.  In other words, this movie has no redeeming value, and even the onanist should look elsewhere.  For something in a similar vein and from the same era, but that is actually enjoyable, I'd recommend something from the Something Weird catalogue instead.",1102204800,10,946,4.63855421686747
1879737,4,B000096IA4,"A couple of young newlyweds take a wrong turn in a Mediterranean country and discover that they have trespassed onto the grounds of a prison for women.  Black transsexual Ajita Wilson plays the warden who decides to throw the blonde wife in jail and, incredibly, to let the husband go.  Why, so he can come back or go to complain somewhere?  Most of the gorgeous inmates are fair-skinned.  They all labor in a rock quarry under the blazing sun topless with cut-off jeans.  How do they keep from having their skin burned off by sunburn?  The governor of the province and his wife are sadists who use the prison inmates to satisfy their perverse desires.  The movie is a veritable orgy of depravity.  The action includes lesbianism, sex under coercion, false imprisonment, white slavery, hunting women as sport, brutality, etc.  Franco has a role as a gay pimp.  Despite some obviously outrageous and even ridiculous aspects this movie works for me.  It is quite similar to Ilsa, the Wicked Warden.  Franco is pretty good at these WIP type movies.",1096848000,19,1045,4.776536312849162
1879738,3,B000096IA4,"I have tried to own every old '70's Euro-sexplotation flick worth watching...so when I bought this film recently I had very high expectations.  I ended up giving it three stars because it hits the mark in some important areas, but misses the chance to be an excellent five star sex flick with others.  Is there naked women being abused in this film?  Yes.  Are the abuse scenes ""erotic enough"" to excite the common ""freaky"" viewers out there?  Somewhat.

For example, in one sequence where a young, hot looking naked prisoner girl was caged and subsequently ""whipped"" by the transsexual wardon...the whipping of her breasts was done so gently and ridiculously fake...it was a phony turn off!

However, in another sexual scene where a young prisoner girl was sold into sexual slavery to a rough looking guy on a fishing boat...his subsequent rape of that girl was a ""very hot"" sex scene and worth all three stars, in my rating of this film!  So you see folks...if you are looking for constant stimulation while watching this old sex classic...you have to look elsewhere, such as the film ""The Image"".

I know there are couples out there just dying to get their hands on these old Euro sex flicks to watch after a nice dinner to lead them into a sexual fantasy mode...this movie may be good enough to do that for you...

The hot sex scene on the boat with the kidnapped teen is worth a boner or two!",1092960000,29,1397,4.596774193548387
1879739,2,B000096IA4,"This film caught my interest when I watched the trailer on Blue Underground's Web site. But, alas, as so often happens, the trailer was better than the movie. ""Sadomania"" is overly long for what it is and much of it tends to drag. There are several  eye-rolling moments to nudge you out of your stupor, however: A woman getting attacked by an obviously plastic alligator; prison uniforms of Daisy Dukes and boots--and nothing else; a governor's bushy fake mustache; toy guns, one of which even drips water when fired; and director Jess Franco in a small role as a swishy gay pimp. There are attempts to augment the movie's lack of sadism by offering plenty of sleaze, like the governor's wife (imagine a young Terri Garr in ""The Ivana Trump Story"") having sex with the prisoners to arouse her husband, then promptly selling them into white slavery (and after she tearfully told her husband she wants to have his baby!). But between the laughable dialog (the guards actually say, ""Halt! Who goes there?"") and sloppy production values, such trashy plot twists just add to ""Sadomania""'s silliness.
The prison's warden is played by transexual actress Ajita Wilson, who, aside from its laughable campy moments, may be the only other reason to see ""Sadomania"". Wilson's an exotic beauty and definitely dominates the scenes she's in, but Ilsa she's not. In an interview included on this DVD Franco says Wilson wasn't comfortable with her character's brutality and you can tell. Given her career in hard- and soft-core porn, it's not surprising she seems more at home in her sexier moments, like seducing a prisoner's skinny husband.
Franco can't be entirely dismissed as a talentless hack, yet he makes so many decisions that make him appear so. Fans of his other movies may wonder what--and if--he was thinking with ""Sadomania."" The DVD's extras--an interview with Franco, Spanish and English trailers, a bio of the late Ajita Wilson--almost make it worth three stars. Too bad ""Sadomania""'s three-star extras can't make up for the two-star movie.",1089676800,45,2040,5.0

1879741,2,B000096IA4,"This movie comes with a lot of hype but very little substance.  We start with a newlywed couple who drive onto private property.  The man is let go, but the woman is thrown in a women's prison.  A prison where guards and prisoners all go topless.  A tyrannical and sadistic warden watches over all.
But the warden and the prison seem to be around solely for the benefit of the Governor and his wife as they take advantage of the availability of the female captives.
Throw in a little slavery, prostitution, and the return of the new husband bent on rescuing his bride and you pretty much have the whole film.
Nudity, depraved sex, and violence are in almost every single scene.  But there is little or no feeling of connection in the movie.  The warden's wife is trying to have his baby but some of the methods are suspect.  The warden becomes a simpering ditz in the end.  Too many of the characters look alike and cause confusion.
This is a good movie if you want to look at topless women, but if you want story or any real drama, this is one to avoid.",1078185600,61,1054,4.341836734693878
1879742,5,B000096IA4,"That this DVD keeps on the same winning track of the other Blue Underground releases, it goes without saying.

1879762,3,B000096IA4,"They all sound pretty interesting (if you like women in prison movies) but for the most part, they are all very obviously softcore porn and that of a very low budget production.  But, for this film ""Sadomania"" I will say that the picture quality is very, very, good, but the English dubbing is kinda bad.  And you get no option to hear it in its original language (I think either Italian or Spanish), so you'll have to accept the poor English dubbing.

If you like films where all the women (the prison guards as well as the prisoners) are gorgeous, topless, and sweaty than this film is for you.  I wasn't too crazy about the gay scene or the girl being raped by a dog, but the other sexual scenes were quite decent, especially because the film transfer looks really good.

I've watched several ""women in prison"" films this past year, but I'll have to say that Sadomania is the second best one I've seen (of the low budget, soft porn genre), but my favorite ""women in prison"" film is still Pam Grier's early seventies film ""Black Mama, White Mama.""

But with Sadomania, you get lots of gorgeous sweaty hot blondes.  However, the Warden was a black female (transsexual), but was still quite beautiful.  I heard she died.  Oh well.",1248220800,3,1230,4.554545454545455
