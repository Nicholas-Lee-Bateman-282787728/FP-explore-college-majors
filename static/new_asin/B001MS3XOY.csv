8321581,5,B001MS3XOY,I went to one of the Chopra Center's retreats and was able to attend a couple of Claire's classes in person. She is incredible! This is a great exercise program for athletes and helpful for people who are very physically active and want to prevent injury. The music and backdrop make this video a great experience. I wish she would make more!,1284681600,,342,4.532258064516129
