She stars in this silly low budget flick.
I'm not really sure what the movie is about but if you are a old-school Vanity fan this is a must.
Enjoy and take a trip down memory lane.

The movie has decent action and a decent storyline.  The dialogue is funny, as well as the costumes. From ""the finger, too fork over the Ram K"", are some of the craziest one liners!

One of the best underrated movies of the 80's",1501200000,,374,4.391304347826087

What made it special though, was the iconic Prince protege and the most beautiful woman to ever walk the planet... ""Vanity"" AKA Denise Matthews. Loved her scenes. Her charisma is something to behold. She's legendary in her own right. Nice seeing a young John Stamos and Gene Simmons as well. This will be a cherished gem of mine. Thanks for re-issuing.

593268,3,6303155014,"Hermaphrodite nightclub performer/super villain Velvet Von Ragner (Gene Simmons, channeling Tim Curry from The Rocky Horror Picture Show) has a plan to poison the city's water supply with radioactive waste.  After Simmons kills super spy Drew Stargrove (one-time James Bond George Lazenby, completely wasted) it's up to his high school student son (John Stamos) and former partner (Vanity) to foil the plan.

Gene Simmons is actually surprisingly effective.  The same can't be said for John Stamos or Vanity, although they are so horribly miscast that both are at least good for some laughs.  It can be hard to tell how much of Never Too Young To Die is intentionally amusing and how much is accidental comedy, But since the screenplay is by Steven Paul who is responsible for Jerry Lewis' second most notorious film, the almost legendarily bad Kurt Vonnegut Jr. adaptation Slapstick of Another Kind, it seems likely that whatever entertainment value Never Too Young To Die might provide is purely accidental.

Except for Gene Simmons, that is.  He got to play a more respectable and realistic villain in the Rutger Hauer action flick Wanted Dead or Alive but his campy, over the top performance here is entirely appropriate for the material.  And considering that Gene Simmons is also the most famous member of the hard rock band Kiss his lack of homophobia in fully embracing flamboyant villain Velvet Von Ragner is kind of surprising but definitely welcome.  If only I could say that something else was genuinely good about Never Too Young To Die.

This is one wildly ridiculous movie.  First and most obvious is the awful casting of Vanity and John Stamos.  Then there's the fact that the villain employs silly looking henchmen who seem to have wandered in by accident from the set of The Road Warrior.  There's the poorly staged action scenes--one actually anticipates the most famous stunt from the original Fast and Furious film with Vanity driving a sports car under and between the wheels of a moving truck during a chase scene.  But here the shot immediately before she does it clearly shows that her automobile is way too high off the ground for the maneuver to actually work so the sequence ends up being very silly rather than exciting.  Never Too Young To Die also features a so laughable it has to be seen to be believed erotic scene between Vanity and Stamos, tacky production values, ridiculous dialogue and so much general awfulness that the movie can almost seem good if you are in the mood for over the top camp.  But if laughing at bad movies isn't your thing then Never Too Young to Die will probably be completely unwatchable.",1494979200,2,2649,4.868596881959911
593269,4,6303155014,I gave it 4 stars because I'm a die hard fan of Vanity whether or not the movies were good or bad.  She knew how to make love to the camera...naturally.

593272,2,6303155014,"Id love to have been a fly on the wall when this bizarre mess was brainstormed.  Its essentially what you might get if you were to take an 80s kids afterschool special about a sullen outcast teen (Lance) discovering his inner strength to save the day, crossbred it with a 70s postapocalyptic action film, then tossed in Robert Englund in a bit part, Gene Simmons as a cackling psycho hermaphrodite called Velvet, and produced the whole mess on a shoestring budget, most of which was seemingly dedicated to hairspray.

The result is watchable enough to avoid falling all the way down to one star, but only because I find it amusing to stare in disbelief at old lowbudget cinematographic trainwrecks.",1485820800,,698,4.808333333333334

593324,4,6303155014,"Was there ever a more '80s movie than ""Never Too Young to Die""? If the combination of John Stamos in his first movie role, Vanity, and Gene Simmons as the evil hermaphrodite Velvet Von Ragnar (!), a role that pretty much cost him an acting career doesn't positively scream ""1986"" I don't know what would. The big drawback is that this film is only available on VHS, and since it has a bit of a cult following it is quite expensive.

The movie opens with the insane Ragnar leading a bunch of criminal misfits juxtaposed with Stamos doing his trampoline and gymnastics practice at college. That his character name is Lance Stargrove should tell you all you need to know. Lance's Dad is a super-secret agent clearly inspired by James Bond (later there's even a callback to a Bond staple in the introduction ""Stargrove. Lance Stargrove."") Anyway, Stargrove senior is out to stop Ragnar and ends up paying the ultimate price for his country, and yes, it really does involve a bulletproof umbrella. Fortunately Lance inherits his dad's farm complete with top secret and heavily armed laboratory and Vanity as a farmhand/stablemaid/expert marksman/love interest. Just think about this dream cast for a moment and stand in awe. In a totally unpredictable plot development (I trust I'm not spoiling anything here for any multicellular organisms) Lance, despite being a college gymnast and with zero training, takes on the mantle of righteousness and prepares to tangle with Ragnar and his murderous fingernail. (I am making none of this up.)

Because this is a movie starring Gene Simmons, there has to be a musical number, right? Of course, but don't expect a bass guitar, though the footwear and garish costume will please fans. Ragnar has a nightclub act in drag (I love the feather boa) at a seedy L.A. club called ""The Incinerator"" and the musical ditty here will be quite a departure for those more used to ""Detroit Rock City"". I have rarely laughed so hard at a movie. Before long we are treated to the most deliciously contrived motorcycle sabotage in film history, medieval bikers on the rampage, Vanity as a stunt driver in a topless Corvette, and John Stamos as an action hero, all set to a very synthesized soundtrack.

Ragnar wants to poison the Los Angeles water supply with a radioactive contaminant, but needs a mysterious computer disc from Stargrove's collection for a reason I was never entirely clear on. Anyway, get a load of Vanity in the suede fringed pantaloons (1980's secret agent standard issue) but watch out for the petulant and cloying love scene between Stamos and Vanity that was surely responsible for the film's ""R"" rating. This is one of the most uncomfortable scenes I have ever seen committed to film for a whole slew of reasons. The plot's ridiculousness only intensifies with a double-identity shocker for the versatile thespian Simmons that presages ""Face/Off"" by more than a decade. It is guaranteed to make you roll your eyes and laugh. There is a mighty cataclysmic fight of good guys and bad guys, which made me consider this puzzler: if Stargrove gets ahold of a machine gun and has a clear shot at Ragnar, why doesn't he shoot him versus some of his trivial minions? (Please enjoy the pointless and lengthy firefight that goes nowhere and particularly watch for the uber-realistic muzzle flashes from the guns.) Never mind, as we have more helicopter and car chase scenes to get to. Sort of. Actually Ragnar does escape in a vehicle, but I'm confused by his choice of transportation: he leaps into a very old tractor trailer pulling two trailers. Surely this is a great choice to escape from those poky Corvettes and motorcycles, right? Again, never mind, because it all comes to a climax with a lot of witty banter between Ragnar and Stargrove in some one-one-one combat with totally predictable twists and turns and the greatest death scene in movie history along with the greatest bomb-tossing civilization save ever seen. I laughed so hard I watched it multiple times.

With Stamos, Simmons, and Vanity (as Danja Deering!) this is the perfect encapsulation of cheesy 1980's movies, and my wish would be for the new season of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" to do this gem of Western culture. I absolutely loved the silliness, ludicrous plotpoints, inane dialogue, and cast of thousands (the credits includes characters like ""Sacrificed Punkette"", ""Exploding Biker"", and ""Minkie""). This movie is so entertaining on so many levels that I feel bad about giving it four stars. The sole reason I didn't give it five stars for Zen-like perfect cheese is it's hard to find and only on VHS. It's worth it for bad movie aficionados even if you have to go buy a new VCR just to see it!

Highly recommended!",1464393600,4,4736,4.8636926889715

She is so beautiful.  She is one of those kinds of actresses that makes many known bad or low-budget films, but it's that kind of cheesiness that makes it a guilty pleasure. Bad, low-budget films have there own kind of charm.

I don't expect that this film would ever be released on Blu-Ray but the way that I see some video companies putting out.... (for example):

""Five stupid, low budget, likely long forgotten, adolescent teen-teaser films in one unique box set for just $9.99!""

I'd hope to see this film be one of them, released with four other arguably considered lame other films, someday.

7840732,5,6303155014,"Never Too Young to Die is one of the most eighties films you will ever see. The film stars John Stamos who joins forces with his fathers partner Vanity after daddy is killed trying to prevent a hermaphrodite, played by Gene Simmons, from poisoning the towns water supply.

The Good: Vanity and Gene Simmons. Vanity is simply ethereal in this film. There doesnt seem to be a shot where she isn't effortlessly beautiful. She also shows decent action and acting chops. She is not Meryl Streep mind you but compared to say Denise Richards in The World Is Not Enough she is a cut above as the action heroes girlfriend.

 Gene Simmons is the other gem. Channeling both Tim Currys Dr. Frank-N-Furter and The Joker. He takes what could have easily been an offensive and problematic bad guy and makes him/her so over the top offensive and problematic it becomes a delightful tour de force.

The Bad: Well the rest of the movie. George Lazenby (That guy who keeps Timothy Dalton from being the worlds worst Bond) is kinda just there and while John Stamos isn't awful by any means he can hardly hold his own against Vanity and Gene Simmons. (Yeah let that thought roll around in your head a minute.)

Gene Simmons minions look like they wandered off the Death Wish 3 set or perhaps a post-apocalyptic Full Moon Feature. They are entertaining enough but so out of place in the universe as is the army chasing them. Gil Bettmans direction is a simple point and shoot affair with some strange choices. He shoots a sex scene that clearly calls for an Emmanuel style soft focus linger in the same fast cut back and forth he shoots the action scenes.

Overall: This is not a good movie. This, however, is an incredible eighties film. Vanity and Simmons simply elevate the already insane base material to a new level. It may not be defensible but it is sure entertaining.",1521417600,,1853,4.6
7840733,5,6303155014,"THis movie isn't too far removed from the first Kingsman movie if Colin Firth was supposed to be a dishy older woman and Samuel L Jackson was an insane drag queen hermaphrodite from Mad Max. Yes, somehow all this gets jammed together with extra crazy bits like a grown up version of the Asian kid from the Goonies gone more homicidal. You'll be hard pressed to be bored during this movie.

John Stamos plays the improbably named gymnast Lance Stargrove. His dad is a super spy fighting a crazed hermaphrodite named Velvet Von Ragnar played by the Gene Simmons looking something like Dee Snider from Twisted Sister crossed with Cher. His personality seems like an amalgamation of the Joker from Batman, Blofeld from James Bond, and Tim Curry from Rocky Mountain Horror Picture Show. Simmons  probably had a solid career as movie villains if this movie and Runaway with Tom Selleck were any real indication of his talent. He kills Stamos dad and it leads to him going out for revenge. It leads him to Vanity as the maybe girlfriend and definitely spy partner of his dad. The movie only gets more Oedipal from there.

I don't want to spoil anything.  I mean I don't think anyone would believe half the plot beats of the movie because it's just that crazy.. The movie is a lot like Suicide Squad, Big Trouble in Little China, or a Fast and The Furious movie in the sense that it feels like a very lucid 13 year old boy's dream.  I mean that as a compliment. The movie's charm is that it's not self aware in any sense and simply serves up it's interests to us in the most enthusiastic way possible.

The movie transfer to Amazon Video looks good. I had some audio issues occasionally but I think that was mostly cause of my network connection and not the fault of Amazon. It's also surprisingly cheap. Can't recommend this silliness enough",1519257600,,1834,4.576219512195122

7840736,5,6303155014,"This is an amazing film that just drips with the 80s.

You have a post apocalyptic gang led by Gene Simmons battling John Stamos and Vanity.  How can you go wrong?",1507593600,,163,4.225806451612903
7840737,5,6303155014,"""Never Too Young To Die"" is a spectacularly abysmal movie from 1986, about an all-American teen (John Stamos) trying to stop an evil, hermaphroditic rock star (Gene Simmons) from poisoning the water supply. If you need more information than that, this isn't for you. It's a fun, dumb movie, but what struck me was how innocent it was. Not that it's particularly nave for the time. It was more the juxtaposition of the 80's with now.

For the last four hundred years, I've watched humans bumble through life robotically reacting to stimuli in predictable patterns, all wanting the same things. If you know what they value, what they lack, and where they fall on the egoism/altruism axis, you can predict just about everything they'll do. They're like kittens. They see a feather and think it's a bird. The feather moves and they jump after it. No matter how many times they catch the feather, they never realize it's not a bird. They can't make it stop moving because it's not real.

Anyway, the internet created an influx of information, much of it made up or completely insane.  In olden times, new ideas trickled in slowly through people you knew and had a lot in common with. If someone was crazy, you knew. If someone new came to your village, they would have to earn your trust. Each person saw themselves as the center of a target surrounded by concentric rings. The ring closest to you was family. The ring after were friends, then tribe, then everyone else.

Life was simple. The farther removed someone was, the less you trusted them. Families were big, and everyone in the tribe knew each other. Today, the diagram might be you-> family-> people you've met -> Facebook friends -> Twitter Followers ->etc. The rings are thicker but hazy. Within Facebook friends you might break it down further as people I've spoken to-> familiar names -> familiar avatars -> randos Facebook thought I'd have something in common with. These days, you're lucky to know five people well. So when you read something online, you probably don't know the person who shared it, let alone the source.

You can find information to verify any idea, so nothing is truly verifiable. Some people trust Snopes. Others think it's a tool of the conspiracy. Everything you believe is a matter of faith. Cognitive dissonance is so prevalent that the traditional concept of truth has shorted out, and it's getting more and more obvious that reality is a figment of the imagination.

The shift from classical true/false logic to the Discordian ""everything is equally true, false, and meaningless"" is accelerating the evolution of consciousness. The mind must adapt or break. Much like the Iiitis prophesied in ""Birth,"" the change is helpful to some and hurtful to others. Think of it as philosophical puberty.

What does this have to do with Never Too Young To Die""?

Gene Simmons was in Kiss, the quintessential prototype of 80's rebellion. They were the devil manifested as a crappy bar-band, breathing fire, adorned with face paint and glittery codpieces, singing about sex and rebellion to thousands of denim-clad fornicators. Demonic, to be sure. Every negative counterpart of the divine boils down to the ego, and nothing embodies the ego like Kiss.

Still, life was pretty good in the 80's. Teen angst had carried the rebellion of the 50's-70's, but, with nothing valid to rebel against, it turned into a decadent caricature of revolution. At its core, it was all an excuse to have fun, pump your fist, and be part of a throng. It was straightforward and innocent.

Now, everything is post-modern. The president is a reality TV star, the ocean is radioactive, and there are 74 different flavors of Oreos. An artistic interpretation of the cold war plays out on the news while people riot over statues and the right of Nazis to Tweet about ethnic cleansing. Madonna's daughter launched her career with a song about being a poor, normal teenager who's sick of opulence in pop music.

Watching humans go is like seeing a cat fall off a TV that's showing an old chimpanzee-western, in a house that's on fire and infested with Smurfs that are too high to walk out the door. It's exquisitely entertaining, just like this movie.",1506038400,,4200,4.835654596100278
