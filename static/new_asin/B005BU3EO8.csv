4647301,5,B005BU3EO8,"I could relate to everything she talked about.  Like hitting the nail on the head.
A light bulb went on. This seminar and Dr. Aron's book explains why I have felt like I have
my entire life.  I've always felt different than everyone I've been around and it's
been difficult not feeling like I belong anywhere, or with the people that have come into my life.
No one seems to understand my sensitivity and how being in crowds don't feel natural to me,
even when I enjoy myself and get along with everyone.  However, by the time I get home, I feel
as though I don't know if what I am feeling are my own feelings or ones I picked up from the others
around me. Over the years I've been told to ""just do it"" or ""fake it until you make it"" but somehow
those phrases don't compute.  After an over-load of stimuli during the day, I just shut down, like I
can't take anymore in.  I just go to sleep.  Or, I feel like I want to just close my eyes.  I'm reading
Dr. Aron's book and learning how other out there feel as I do. Even doctors want to label me ADD
or by-polar.  It's just that I don't feel comfortable with my surroundings but somehow I manage and have learned
to compensate over the years for what I have perceived as shortcomings in my personality.  That somehow my
brain is wired differently.  I have had bouts of migraines, on a daily basis, when I've been way over
stimulated with work and life around me. I still get migraine auras, without the pain, and they hit when
I least expect them. Afterwards I feel drained of energy.  Due to all the overload, all the time, I'm becoming
more reclusive.  It has affected my relationships and work.  Even though I know what I want to do, I just can't seem to put myself in a situation where I know I am going to be over-worked(over-stimulated) everyday.  Hopefully I will learn
some techniques that will help me co-exist with others without the over-load, or taking on feelings from
others. That's some basics of my story, but there is so much more to it than meets the eye.  As I'm sure
other HSPs can understand.  I don't like labels, but I can relate to having a certain ""trait"" that others have.  It's nice
to know that someone has finally discovered our ""trait"" and that we are very special people.  The world needs more
people like us.",1356739200,43,2287,4.328638497652582
4647302,5,B005BU3EO8,"I loved this DVD. It was really inspiring and hard to stop watching it. Elaine Aron gives a lot of practical advice that I have been able to use both at work as well as with my family. I showed the video to my parents who are not sensitive, and they now have a whole new appreciation for what it means to be highly sensitive. The brain scanning studies convinced them that I'm not making this up and they are now interested in learning more about ways that they can be supportive of me and my daughters.

Also, she is a very boring person to listen to.  She is responding to the Q and A at the end which are disjointed and represent the seminar which isn't on the DVD.

8464249,5,B005BU3EO8,"I am a HSP, 50 years old. I did not know about my trait until a few years ago. Reading Elaine's books has been helpful, but having this DVD to hear her voice was even more encouraging. It's as if her landmark book was condensed and personalized into a lecture. The DVD is built for us HSPs, with lots of places to pause the lecture. There is a lot of information, and since I am currently in a period of overstimulation, it took me two sessions to listen to it.

Elaine speaks to a group of HSPs, but the information would also be helpful to non-sensitive loved ones of HSPs. She even spends time speaking to parenting highly sensitive children.

After a lifetime of being told I was weird, strange, lazy, shy, and mean, I am eternally grateful to Elaine's research. She has helped me discover a wealth of assets that I can share with the world, as long as I respect and take care of my highly-sensitive body. When I don't want to take the time to read one of her books, I will use this DVD to remind myself what to do.",1412208000,6,1019,4.247422680412371

8464252,5,B005BU3EO8,"I already knew I  was a highly sensitive person. I have taken the evaluation and read part of the book on highly sensitive children.  I had no idea how normal I am for a highly sensitive person.  This talk highlights all the things you need to know.  I'm sure if I read all the books I would understand more thoroughly but that isn't necessary.  (Of course I will read the books because I always want more information.)
As I listened to Ms Aron describe the highly sensitive person I cried.  She was describing me as an adult, a worker, a parent and a child.  There wasn't one thing that I couldn't relate with.  I was encouraged knowing I'm normal for a HSP.  I needed to hear this.  If you suspect that you or someone you love is highly sensitive this DVD is a good resource.  This is an excellent resource for anyone who works with people or children.  20% of them are Highly Sensitive.",1393545600,20,889,4.353658536585366
