8375929,5,B002OCYTM2,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-Geese-II-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Great-Britain/dp/B002OCYTM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild Geese II [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Great Britain </a>]Wild Geese II is an excellent follow up to the original Wild Geese with Richard Burton.  Scott Glenn is ex-special forces with a brooding heart over the loss of his family but with superior skills at intelligence, counter-intell, anti-terrorist tactics etc.  He is offered a job to investigate the kidnapping of one of the last survivors of the German holucost hireachy, Rudolf Hess and bring him out of East Germany then deliver him to an american news corporation.  That is the jist.  Scott Glenn and especially Edward Fox are urbane, sophisticated and leathally combat efficient.  By the way Scott's character has a huge price on his head by terrorist groups that want him dead.  That's what makes this movie work for me.  Sir Lawrence Olivier is supberb as Rudolph Hess ex-nazi imprioned in the famous Spandau Prison sentenced to life without parole for crimes against humanity.  Unfortunately this version of the movie is not Region 1 (USA & Canada) compatible with our DVD equipment.  There is so much more to this movie that can't be said here, but die-hard fans of military style, commando type movies from my generation who grew up in the 50's & 60's will enjoy this movie if it ever comes in a region 1 format on DVD.  I still have my VHS original recording and I recorded it on to DVD and that gives me the opportunity to watch it when the yearn hits but that is just okay.  If this movie ever comes out for region one I will be one of the first to get my copy.  Rich with characters, plots within plots and the cinematography is priceless.  I'll keep hopeing for region one.  If you liked the original Wild Geese you will like this one.",1253318400,4,1891,5.077669902912621
