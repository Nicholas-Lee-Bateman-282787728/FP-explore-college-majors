8214694,2,B000UTABHS,"This was one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen.  Is this how movies from the 70's are like?  I have to say that the footage of bigfoot looks very fake in the movie. It was a mockup, except in the end.  Bigfoot looks real in the last 10 seconds of the movie, which gave me chills.",1207267200,,283,3.9298245614035086
8214695,4,B000UTABHS,"Reviews about ""Legend of Bigfoot"" I have read on other sites can be amazingly shortsighted. One reviewer called this film ""pointless and boring."" In fact, the footage is stunningly beautiful. We see wildlife footage rarely seen. Most of it dating to the 1950s. Near the beginning of the film, we see Marx's wife turn a page on a calendar, it is 1951. Data point.

Wildlife Tracker Ivan Marx has been all over North America, from the southwest desert to north of the arctic circle in both Alaska and the Yukon. He filmed spectacular scenes of wolves, mountain lions, musk ox, mountain goats eating dirt, and the biggest bull moose I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of moose, this one was the ""monarch"".

I think someone who finds nature footage ""pointless and boring"" might be considered sensationalist, and is probably looking for closeups, DNA testing, incontrovertible proof.

Beyond that, nature seems to actually bore such people. How can you be, on the one hand, interested in the subject of a wild creature, as is the supposed bigfoot, but on the other hand find nature boring? I am reminded of a Japanese soldier who was discovered living on a South Pacific island in the 1970s, he didn't quite realize the war had ended, though he suspected it. When he was returned to Japan, he was startled by youth's loss of appreciation for nature. I think this movie shows a lot of the nature that probably doesn't exist any more. Even during the filming, Marx showed habitat loss in Alaska, with the beginning of the building of the Alaska Pipeline. Back to the Japanese soldier, who was saddened by a loss of sensitivity to nature. ""Nature is never boring,"" he said, in translated quotation.

Anyway, it seems to be a contradiction to be interested in the bigfoot, but disinterested in its living habitat.

What I am driving at is how remarkably Marx does what other bigfoot documentaries fail to do, and that is actually get to bigfoot by sensitizing himself to the habitat and living patterns of wild life, in general. Most bigfoot hunting documentaries seem disproportionately focused on the actual creature, which happens to exist within a wild context. The wild life, in other words, is almost always secondary and incidental. Marx's psychology is superb. Like a detective, he uncovers what makes the bigfoot tick, and maps out a probable migration pattern, follows it, and proves his hypothesis.

To those who blindly zero in on the bigfoot by isolating it from its relationship to wildlife, you remind me of another reviewer who said something about being an ""armchair"" sasquatch hunter. That armchair is the problem. This documentary has nothing to do with armchairs, it is a naturalist providing us with a naturalist's view of the nature; it is immersion journalism.

As for the actual bigfoot images we see, I am undecided, but in the main I think they are authentic. Here's why: Not a whole lot about this film seems staged. Marx gives me an impression of being the salt-of-the-earth type, an exemplary tracker. The style is that 1950's ""Ward Clever"" or Roy Rogers style of narration. While Marx is impassioned, albeit in a simple, country way, he is also anti-sensationalist. I can tell Marx is a genuine animal lover, as he stated in the beginning that he only tracked and shot animals that were real problems to ranchers and people. I can totally identify with this character, everything about him strikes me as reminiscent of such people I have met in my own life. The tons of footage on other animals is not only interesting and beautiful to look at, but relevant, as well. He wants us to see the bigfoot as we see other wild creatures. He's right!

*Escape From Angola*
I suppose I need to comment on the second film packaged with this DVD, ""Escape from Angola"". Well, I don't find I have a lot of good things to say. The sound track was lousy, I had to double the volume on my television to barely hear it. Africa was beautiful, of course. The Tors brothers sort of remind me the Hanson brothers, with their Seventies-ish long hair. All very machismo, patronizing in a misogynist and colonialist sort of way.",1192147200,5,4126,4.76890756302521
