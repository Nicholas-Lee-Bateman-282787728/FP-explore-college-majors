2605873,1,B000GETUC4,I was given this by a friend and thought that I vaguely remembered it from my youth. As i watched this I was struck by how poor the animation was and how under cooked the stories were. I know most of the reviews on here are favorable but I just can't say that this one aged as well as some of the other shows that they are bring out now. This one just didn't work for me.,1176076800,5,371,3.831168831168831
2605874,3,B000GETUC4,"Ahh...the seventies.  I remember really liking this one as a kid.  If you've never seen it: Think ""Superfriends"" in space.  The animation is classic 70's Filmmation.  In other words, not really very good.  But the stories are reasonably well-done, although this is strictly kids' stuff (the robot Moe is particularly grating to my adult mentality).

The bottom line is, Space Sentinels is a nice nostalgic trip if you were between the ages of 5 and 12 in 1977.  For most everyone else, it's probably not worth owning.",1165276800,14,517,4.873563218390805
2605875,5,B000GETUC4,"When I was a kid I watched it at times and remembered it being more in travels of variing degree across space, time, and other realities or some such.  This was the last good cartoon on Saturday morning(replaced by dumbed down 80's crapolas as Pac Man and ""The Littles"")  Unlike the compartmentalized ""themes"" of today's scociety, this played on everything and was freeflowing creativewise and plot wise.  The atlantians(or whatever they were) were remenscent of Greek gods or, well atlantians.  You have to be an intelligent child to watch it and like it.  Much like Blackstar and others mixing sci-fi and fantasy, again, it did not play on a rigid theme, it just played on Tee VEE and was fun to watch.",1161993600,6,704,4.737704918032787
2605876,4,B000GETUC4,"Space Sentinels was created by Filmation and appeared on network television as a Saturday morning cartoon in the late 1970's, comprised of 13 episodes.  Three main characters, Hercules, Astrea and Mercury go on various adventures on Earth and sometimes in space.  On the spaceship resides a sentient computer acting as an advisor known as Sentinel One and a little robot that borders on a traditional Filmation mascot, Maintenance Operator or simply MO.  The original title was called Young Sentinels and the characters sometimes introduce themselves as Young Sentinels in the dialogue.  The voice acting is slightly more diverse-there are three main actors doing most of the voices, but in this particular series, Filmation added others without crediting them specifically, such as the standard Lou and Erika Scheimer and then some other actors who were used irregularly such as Linda Gary, Diane Pershing and even Ted Cassidy (""The Time Traveler"").  Other items that made this show unique for its time (1977) was the multi-ethnic cast (Mercury was of Asian ethnicity), and having a African/American woman as the leader.  This is a very brief run down of each Space Sentinels episode.

MORPHEUS: THE SINISTER SENTINEL
Another sentinel with an evil alignment and who has the power of Astrea, Hercules and Mercury combined, comes to Earth for revenge.

SPACE GIANTS
The sentinels have to deal with giant tough-to-beat robots who are initially after some gold as fuel.

THE TIME TRAVELER
A human from an advanced time period has returned to stop the construction of a moon base by destroying the supply rockets (unmanned) shortly after launch.

THE SORCERESS
A large section of the north pole has vanished, and the sentinels are dispatched to investigate.

THE RETURN OF ANUBIS
Anubis (for some reason they don't correctly refer to him as the god of death) is revived and wants to exact revenge on human beings-the sentinels go to stop this from occuring.

THE WIZARD OF OD
The sentinels travel to an alternate universe to investigate and defeat a device that alters reality.

THE PRIME SENTINEL
Another Sentinel One-like computer, known as the Prime Sentinel, has been compromised by an evil unknown force, and the Young Sentinels journey into space to fix the problem.

COMMANDER NEMO
An eco-terrorist threatens civilization and sentinels travel into the ocean to find and stop him.

VOYAGE TO THE INNER WORLD
Astrea is kidnapped with the intent to use her to power an underground civilization against her will.  Hercules, Mercury, Sentinel One and MO use their spaceshipt to burrow their way to the city to rescue her.

LOKI
A powerful human from another dimension is freed and sends Hercules and Mercury into his dimension which allows him to steal their spaceship and use it in an attempt to conquer his original dimension that he came from.

FAUNA
A young girl who has telepathy and can control wild animals, is attacking a laboratory in a forest.  The sentinels are dispatched to investigate.

THE JUPITER SPORE
A semi-intelligent plant is growing so fast it will cover the entire earth in a very short period of time.  The sentinels need to destroy the plant.

THE WORLD SHIP
A large planetoid is on a direct collision course with earth.  The sentinels come to the conclusion that the planetoid must be destroyed to save the earth, so using their spaceship, they intercept the planetoid and find out that further investigation is needed.

The Freedom Force is the other series which is five, 11 minute episodes with Hercules, Isis, Sinbad, Merlin and Super Samurai.  The Freedom Force had it's own mini-ethnic flavor with a otokonoko (Japanese boy) who turned into the giant Super Samurai warrior.  Here is a summary of each episode.

THE DRAGON RIDERS
The Freedom Force investigates a quarrel between the leader of a race called the Valderons, and a high level scientist.

THE SCARLET SAMURAI
The Freedom Force has to deal with an evil wizard who granted another young boy the ability to become a large Samurai warrior similar to Super Samurai.

THE PLANT SOLDIERS
The Freedom Force has to recover a powerful necklace that was stolen from their power pyramid headquarters.

MORGANA'S REVENGE
The Freedom Force has to rescue one of their own members, Hercules, due to a misunderstanding between himself and his horse Pegasus.

THE ROBOT
A robot shows up to save a tribe from an exploding volcano.  The Freedom Force soon discovers there is a lot more to this robot than meets the eye.

The writing is about the same quality on both Space Sentinels and The Freedom Force, but I found Space Sentinels generally more interesting.

The quality of the sound and images are very high, although this boxed set isn't overloaded with extras, if you were to compare this release to the He-Man series.  This boxed set includes four individual interviews of the staff that are just over 5 minutes each, a live action sequence, the original ""Young Sentinels"" introduction, and the same ""The Magic Of Filmation"" that appears in other DVD boxed sets such as He-Man and Flash Gordon.

Other than that, everything else is vintage Filmation.  Usage of silhouttes, recycled footage, and a very 70's ""wah-wah"" guitar in a lot of the background music.  Comparing the plot lines of Space Sentinels to other current modern shows like it, there isn't anything that special, but it's a good effort nonetheless.",1156550400,48,5391,5.002242152466367
2605877,5,B000GETUC4,"Originally titled ""The Young Sentinels"" [changing its name to ""Space Sentinels"" midseason to emphasize their space background], the 1977-78 NBC Saturday morning series ""Space Sentinels"" featured the culturally diverse immortal heroes Hercules, Nordic strongman (""Blackstar's"" George DiCenzo); Astrea, beautiful African American shapeshifter; and Mercury, swift Asian American speedster. The trio, who had been taken from Earth centuries ago then endowed and trained in their special powers by sentient supercomputer Sentinel One, protected the Earth and the galaxy from an assortment of aliens and time-travelers.

The following season in the fall of 1978, Hercules returned to the superhero business on a different network and with a different team. ""The Freedom Force,"" one of seven segments from CBS's ninety-minute ""Tarzan and the Super 7"" show featured The Valley of Time, home of the Freedom Force: Isis, goddess of the elements (""Flash Gordon's"" Diane Pershing); Hercules, the world's mightiest man (now voiced by Bob Denison); Merlin, master of magic; Sinbad, hero of the seven seas; and Super Samurai, giant of justice; all champions of freedom who battled fantasy-driven mythological foes.

2605878,4,B000GETUC4,"In all honesty, don't remember Space Sentinels at all, but I loved Freedom Force as a kid.  I purchased the video on ebay a few years ago, and of course these things are never as good as you remember them.  But it's still a great novelty item, especially for those like myself that loved the live-action Isis program.  Freedom Force featured the only animated incarnation of Isis that I am aware of.  I'm sure the shows will look great on DVD.  All in all, a fun purchase for nostalgia fans, cartoon fans, Isis fans, or for good wholesome entertainment for the kids.",1154822400,8,566,4.509803921568627

2605881,5,B000GETUC4,Really loved watching this! Brought back so many awesome childhood Saturday memories when cartoons ROCKED! I need to order more for my at home collection for my grand kids to know watch and enjoy!,1368057600,,196,4.794117647058823

2605883,5,B000GETUC4,"Bought this mainly for the Freedom Force espisodes. Have to confess I don't remember there  being 5 of them. Bummer. Anyway, after watching some of the sentinels episodes I do vaguely remember them...still good though. I was always a sucker for just about anything filmation put out...not sure why, but their stuff always appealed to me and still does to this day.

I bought several late 70s early 80s saturday morning cartoons, (at 40yrs old), and been having a freakin field day doing 'Old School Saturday Mornings' here lately. My wife just rolls her eyes as she walks thru to get her coffee but I don't care...I'm having one hell of a time reliving my childhood!!

Over all, I HIGHLY recommend this to any 'Old School' fans out there that love to relive the wonder, fun and great shows we grew up with. The audio/video were/are great and well worth picking this up!!!!!

Kids today SURE AS HELL have no idea what a great Saturday morning is.....wake up at the butt crack of dawn, stumble to the tube and flick it on, shield your eyes cause it's so bright and you just woke up, grab a blanket and curl up on the couch and watch the favs, (while trying NOT to fall back asleep or while eating your cereal :) )

2605884,3,B000GETUC4,"I don't remember these series and for good reason. These shows were very short lived because they were ripping off other series in order to produce new toys. That being said, it's a great slice of nostalgia and it's so cheap, I'd say it's actually worth buying just to check out.",1348444800,,279,4.490196078431373
2605885,4,B000GETUC4,It doesn't have DVD quality but still...it is pretty nice and it's worth buying if you are a fan of this kind of cartoons.,1340496000,,122,4.125
2605886,4,B000GETUC4,"The Space(Young?) Sentinels is one of my favorite animated cartoons ever made. The Prime Sentinel and the episode with the evil Sentinel are my favorite episodes. Mo the robot was possibly a mistake, but Mo added a more childish feel to the cartoon which is technically the way it is supposed to be. Astria, Hercules, and Mercury are the three Sentinels. Hercules guest starred on the Freedom Force, my number one animated cartoon of the 70's and possibly ever. All three are immortal(they never die and retain youth forever), are capable of supersonic flight with their ""jetbelts"", and have far beyond Earth's current technology. Astria can change into any animal, real or mythological(lions, tigers, bears, elephants, dragons, anything,etc.) regardless of size or weight. Mercury is capable of flight even faster than the other Sentinels. Mercury also can run and move at the speed of light and also has clear martial arts skills(displays Karate style kicks and strikes in many episodes). Hercules, if you don't already know,is superhumanly strong although not on a par with say, Superman, or the Hulk(in this show). In comics, Hercules was far stronger than in Sentinels but Hercules is far beyond human in the Sentinels. Like Ark II, another really good 70's show(live action too!), good morals are taught but not quite as often. It is pretty subtle too. If you like Superfriends, Avengers, or X-Men, this is probably for you, especially Freedom Force. Super Samurai, a 20 feet tall, armored, far beyond human in strength samurai is one character. Hercules is another. Merlin is another. Sinbad(and Lamprey) is another. Hercules rides Pegasus in the Freedom Force. All those with Isis(same hair color and costume as Secrets of Isis series) to round it off. Now THAT is a SUPER team! Superfriends, superpowers, supervillains, super adventure. The only bad thing may be the outdated sound effects. One final thing but no big deal. Listen for Hercules to call Mercury a famous 70's insult, repeatedly, on the Space Sentinels. Would the networks DARE air it these days? I DOUBT IT! Nothing obscene or cussing but a little surprising. I hope it makes you laugh.",1267920000,2,2160,5.070224719101123
2605887,4,B000GETUC4,Space Sentinels/Freedom Force! The legendary Filmation Studios answer to the Super Friends and just as much fun. I had forgotten all about these little gems. Saturday morning cartoons the way they used to be well before the advent of the 24 hour cartoon network. It's just a shame that there isn't a 24 hour Filmation Station. Can't praise these classics enough.,1252886400,2,362,4.950819672131147
2605888,4,B000GETUC4,I was a huge fan of Freedom Force when I was a kid.  I was so disappointed that there were only a few episodes of it.  I didn't even know it had been made into a dvd and when I saw it boxed together with Space Sentinels I knew I had to buy it. This has brought back some wonderful memories of Saturday mornings.  Two double sided dvds with great quality.  Definitely would recommend to any cartoon fan.,1250899200,2,402,4.115384615384615
2605891,5,B000GETUC4,"I never heard of The Space Sentinels until recently. This is probably Filmation's least attractive Cartoon Series, He-Man being the most. I watch it on Saturdays and it almost depresses me, or maybe it's the creepy music of Thomas A.Chase. I will watch it anyway. I can easily be persuaded to change my mind. It is typical Filmation production. MO is an integral character counterpart of Orko, Cowl or Bat-Mite.
The very short run of The Freedom Force is a little more interesting.
After someone in a discussion forum recommended it to me, and that two Dvds with eighteen episodes for $1.80 at the time, I could not resist.",1239580800,2,623,4.724770642201835
2605892,3,B000GETUC4,"I got this mainly because it was something from my childhood. To be honest I was pleasently surprised. The stories were so so, but the cartoon artwork is actually better then some of what you see today. The story is simple enough, histories greatest heroes are gathered to defend a mystical realm. They kick butt, share the love and the story always has a moral. Remember when all cartoons were like that?",1225497600,3,405,4.638888888888889
2605893,5,B000GETUC4,If you grew up whatching Saturday morning carttons. I would recommend this cd. It was a blast from the past,1198713600,,107,4.4
2605894,5,B000GETUC4,"Sorry, but i had to go ol school cause i thought i would never find these again and the DVD's are in perfect condition and in sinc with video and audio This is a dream come true that i can relive my childhood every time i go to the DVD collecion shelf. Top Notch quality!!!!!!!!!!!!",1197590400,,282,4.1454545454545455
2605895,4,B000GETUC4,"Space Sentinals was a great series, and I actually thought I'd never see it again.  So if you like super heroes, 70's cartoons and obscure series, grab this one.  As with most 70's cartoons the animation isn't as good as the stuff we see today and the plots are simple, but it's still entertaining.  I would only recommend this if you like typical super heroe shows like Superfriends or Spiderman.  It is definately a classic, and I really like it, but it's not universal like Scooby Doo or Bugs Bunny.  You'll need to like the super heroe stereotype.  If you do, purchase it, as it includes the original Young Sentinals, the renamed Space Sentinals, and finally the Freedom Force.  All based on several of the same characters. B+",1194220800,2,730,4.65625
2605896,5,B000GETUC4,Super Samurai!!!  Ha! HA! great 70's goodness  If you are old enough to remember watching this 1st run on T.V. then just pry loose a few dollars and get this. It is allot of fun and brings back memories of a younger time. The extras on the DVD's by the creative genius at Filmation are fun to watch too. These are the series that were the fore runner of other things like HE-MAN and the masters of the universe.,1194134400,3,411,4.189873417721519
2605897,4,B000GETUC4,"If you like the old school still shot animation, you'll enjoy this.  If you are a fan of the original planet of the apes movies/series, you'll enjoy this.  I am both, so it was very enjoyable.  If you are looking for something that compares to todays saturday morning programming or animae, you will be sadly disappointed.",1186963200,2,322,4.714285714285714
2605898,4,B000GETUC4,"I won't go into the name change from Young Sentinels to Space Sentinels;that's already been covered. What we have here is a kind of predecessor to the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (Americanized version), or what at first appears to be rejects from the Super Friends. Don't let appearances fool you; this is still a great superhero series that's worth having. My two personal favorite episodes are THE TIME TRAVELERS and THE RETURN OF ANUBIS. The tyrannosaur voice in TIME TRAVELERS is the exact same cavernous moan used for a T-Rex in the TARZAN,LORD OF THE JUNGLE episode TARZAN AT THE EARTH'S CORE (I wished this series would see a DVD release!),the way a 70's dino should sound! The Freedom Force segments are quite good. Watching Isis animated is great but I wished that JoAnna Cameron had done the voice. The same with Hercules;George DiCenzo in YS/SS and not in FF. Also, the FF episodes end with the opening dialogue laid over the closing credits, but to be honest I really don't remember if that's how the actual broadcasts ended. My reason for four stars is the fact that these are double-sided DVDs with fingerprints and scratches;these didn't hurt playback but are annoying when BCI takes great care in packaging the live-action Filmation shows but from what I've seen not the animated ones.",1186876800,3,1303,4.873873873873874
2605899,5,B000GETUC4,"If you loved cartoons like I did in the '70 then you have to get Space Sentinels. This is one of the show that in my opinion was ahead of it time to think a woman, A black woman at that was the leader of superteam was not something you saw on tv and the cast was multi ethic. I still get a kick out of the space ship. It would be cool if someone would do a modern version with the orginal voice actors just think with the new computer technology and animation graphics. I will say if you never have seen the show its worth picking up. You will enjoy it.",1186444800,3,553,3.9026548672566372
