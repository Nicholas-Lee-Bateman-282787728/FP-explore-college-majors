7888502,4,6305339996,"I have long said, a list like movie featuring most of the beautiful actresses and ladies of the silver screen was due. Alas, a few months ago, I saw this ""documentary"" on most of them in this era on a vhs tape, with Marilyn Monroe on the cover, no less. I was immediately intrigued and bought it cheap. The vhs was made in 1974, but the program itself was done in 1965 or so. It was good, but could have been better. I mean, they didn't even mention Barbara LaMarr, who in her heyday as an actress in the '20s, was described by a judge as ""The most beautiful woman before a movie camera."" A few others were probably left out along the way, but they covered a good portion of them from the early days of cinema up to the mid 1960s. The program goes on to say ""You'll have to wait for another volume to come out"" for more. Yeah, it's clearly overdue. I believe this originally was shot in what is known today as ""widescreen"", but the vhs copy I have is cropped pan and scan and the picture quality is less than perfect, but watchable. I transferred my copy to dvd and it is better than the vhs for sure. I really wish some studio could do this program right, clean it up and put it on bluray for all of us in the original format it was shot in. All in all, a good documentary on the actresses that graced the silver screen in the early days of Cinema.",1391040000,,1349,4.113636363636363

7888504,5,6305339996,"This film, produced in 1965, is a wonderful collage of the many kinds of vamps, starlets, love goddesses, girls-next-door and sirens that have graced the silver screen since the turn of the century.  See Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Lillian Gish, Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Ginger Rogers, Rita Hayworth and even the child star Shirley Temple put their own indelible brand of love on the screen.  It examines how, over the course of sixty years, women's sexuality has evolved, and played itself out in different arenas in film.  While some of the film clips are a little iffy, it is exceptionally well made.  A pure joy to own if you are an admirer of any of the actresses presented, interested in women's studies, pre-code Hollywood or the history of sexuality in film.",991872000,28,802,4.9185185185185185
