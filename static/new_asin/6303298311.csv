624913,4,6303298311,"This BBC TV is based on the true story of Deric and Diana Longden, who were faced with the debilitating symptoms of what was at the time undefined Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome, with Diana a paralytic who has blackouts. The trap in dramatising this kind of tale is allowing the proceedings to get either too maudlin or too icky sweet uplifting. Adapter playwright Jack Rosenthal and director Richard Loncraine overcome this but fall into the opposing trap, by making the situations mundane and distracting the narrative with the seemingly unnecessary plight of the Longden's to be married son, and the lack of success of Deric's business. We don't so much resent the time given to Deric's doddery mother played by Thora Hird since her addle-mindness is so funny, with the reactions to her underplayed as a given.  Thankfully as the Longden's, Julie Walters and particularly Jim Broadbent partially restore the balance by investing their characters with warmth and wit. Walters has the tougher role since it is her last wish for Deric to re-marry, and though she makes her Diana someone to be treasured we also see the pain and frustration of her dependence on Deric. Unlike the couple in the Jill Clayburgh Miles to Go, Diana's wish is only activated by Deric's chance meeting with Aileen (if that name wasn't based on the real person it would be unforgiveable), a writer who happens to be blind. As Diana witnesses Deric's interest in Aileen, she sees that the blindness would allow for Deric to continue his need to watch out for someone, without them being totally dependent. The arrangement isn't pushed, much like Diana's anger towards the medical profession's inability to help her. Since the disease she suffers from is unknown to them, they dismiss her as an ""hysteric"" which matches the medieval hand aides she is given to wear. The film's second half is definitely stronger than the first, as if we need to pause after the gothicness of Diana's encounters with hospitals and before Aileen makes her entrance, and by the conclusion we become grateful that things are left somewhat open, which nicely undercuts what could have deteriorated into tragedy and sentimental sludge.",987724800,17,2202,5.0

THE FILM, IS BRILLIANT. I WOULD DEARLY LOVE TO OWN IT.
WHAT I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY THIS BRITISH FILM, WRITTEN BY A BRITISH AUTHOR, FILMED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, SCREENED IN THE UK, IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE IN A ""REGION 2"" FORMAT.
WILL SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME THE ANSWER. OR TELL ME WHERE I CAN GET A REGION 2 COPY.

7843515,4,6303298311,"You have to wait until the end of this film to find out what this British woman was suffering from, but you will recognize it when you see the words.

Until then, her loving husband attends to her any way he can, as her body continues to deteriorate and fail her. It is a struggle and a triumph for her just to walk unassisted down the aisle at her son's wedding.

The actors give very moving performances, especially the two leads.",1284508800,5,432,4.320987654320987
7843516,5,6303298311,"To anyone who has read the torrent of books from Deric Longden about his his home filled with wilful cats and ruled over by his brilliant fellow author wife who just happens to be blind will know that this man can write about things that should be tragic yet imbue them instead with warmth and dry humour.
This is the story of how two women manipulate poor Deric, in a good way, through what could easily have been a heartbreaking situation.
It speaks volumes for his ability as a writer that, by focusing on the courage, wit and affection of two strong women who love him he can portray this often sad story and still make us smile as he does so. Some of the scenes with his mother are brilliant comedy.
A wonderful grown up true story about wonderful grown up people.",1280188800,2,769,4.384615384615385
