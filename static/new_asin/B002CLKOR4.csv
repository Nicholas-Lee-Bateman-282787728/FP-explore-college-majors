3906341,3,B002CLKOR4,"This is one of the better collections of sci-fi trailers, most of them from the golden age of the 1950's and early 1960's, a few toward the end date as late as 1985. Almost all 50 are complete theatrical trailers, a very few are TV spots. Video quality varies but for the most part is quite acceptable. I would rate this at least four stars, maybe five, except for the fact that you have that annoying Passport ""bug"" (logo) along with the DVD title running continuously in the lower right hand corner all the way through the program. It's pretty faint here but I still hate those things with a passion, one of the worst things cable TV ever brought us. In my opinion when you pay good money for a DVD you should NEVER have to look at those crazy things which really take away from the theatrical experience you are trying to create in your own home. Still recommended for the program content if you like old movie trailers and/or the classic and not so classic science fiction films. A similar companion volume entitled ""Destination Earth: Alien Invaders"" is also available from Passport and is recommended with the same reservation about the continuous ""bug"".",1261180800,14,1160,4.635922330097087

3906390,2,B002CLKOR4,"I watched Destination Outer Space last night. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It appears that a bunch of friend got together and made a Sci-Fi film in the basement, and back yard. The camera work, dialogue  and acting was on the level of nine year olds.

3906395,4,B002CLKOR4,"""Destination: Outer Space"" is Christopher R. Mihm's fifth film, in this case an homage to the 1950s Ed Wood sci-fi school of filmmaking. This film will not be for everyone, and certainly the lead character of Captain Jackson (returning from ""Cave Women on Mars"") is a divisive hero, but strictly as a tribute to the genre the film works. For the aficionado there are lots of references to sci-fi classics (see the other ship that did the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs!) from both obvious (""Star Trek,"" ""Star Wars,"" etc.) and less well-known sources. I liked that this film was played in a lightly comedic way that obviously cherishes the source material versus, say, ""The Monster of Phantom Lake,"" which plays it straighter.

The entire world Mihm invents works thematically (and on a budget) here, with the main design theme of the planet being...triangles. I don't know why this amused me so much, but it did. By far my favorite element of the movie are the ludicrous eyeball creatures that Ed Wood would have adored. (I also loved the spacewalk at around the 18 minute mark!)  In an expected conclusion the film ends with a ""To Be Continued..."" title card which was the best choice to stay in the spirit of these films.

Understand that you will not find this film scary or realistic in any way, and if you don't enjoy the golden years of science fiction, you'd probably be better off staying away from this movie. If, however, you love 1950s sci-fi like Christopher Mihm (and I) do, this is a no-budget lighthearted tribute you will enjoy. The DVD comes with numerous extras including a commentary and a never-ending blooper reel (I wish it was as well-edited as the film) that are quite extravagant for a production of this type. If you love Ed Wood, see this movie. If you don't know who Ed Wood is, you may want to consider this carefully before proceeding.",1424822400,7,1869,4.674772036474164

8364194,5,B002CLKOR4,"Another entertaining addition to the Mihmverse! Josh Craig and Christopher Mihm, did a great job playing off one another in a well written romp in space replete with the proverbial wretched hive of scum and villainy. The bar scene was a treat for us dedicated fans - as opposed to the first two films in the latest trilogy of a certain other space franchise I could name - filled with the usual suspects in the 'Verse.

8364195,4,B002CLKOR4,"The story of Destination: Outer Space goes all over the place! While I found the breakneck pace riveting, I fear that less sophisticated audiences might not be able to handle the sudden twist and turns of the plot, which sees Captain Mike Johnson coping with the aftermath of Cave Women On Mars, going back into space, become adrift in space, crash-landing on another planet and... well, I don't want to give away the whole movie. Suffice it to say it was a welcome change of pace from those Peter Bogdanovich B-movies that are halfway over before you see the titular Prehistoric Women.

Indeed, I think Christopher Mihm might have done better to have pitched Destination: Outer Space as a television series. With a bit more padding, the action of Destination Outer Space could have matched the length and depth of Joss Whedon's Firefly. Then again, Hollywood would probably want to buy the rights and give it to Max Landis to re-imagine it as a vehicle for Shia LeBeouf. So forget it.",1487462400,,985,4.760233918128655

8364197,5,B002CLKOR4,"A homage to the 1950s b movies. Whomever Trinket is obviously doesn't understand this. I'll admit it took a little while to get into the movie due to it's slow build up but once the movie gets going it's good. Hoping for a sequel or possible web series to continue the story. Even a throwback to the radio days would be great. To others who read reviews don't read TRINKETs ridiculous unimportant trolling review. The person's review is non relevant.

8364198,1,B002CLKOR4,"So bad we couldn't even watch it!  Only gave it 1 star because there wasn't a minus choice offered. If you like paying for bad black and white selfies of ugly stupid people pretending to be something they're not, then this bomb is for you.  This is so far below any movie viewers standards, it should have never been offered to steal our money!  Really Amazon, doesn't anyone preview these movies to see if they're profiles are telling the truth?  This is about the 4th movie we've paid to watch, that left us feeling cheated!  We'd like to suggest a couple of ways you could vastly improve your service to your customers:  1.) if the viewer can't stand more than 5 minutes, please offer them a refund or another same priced rental.  2.) use this movie as a guide to improving your selections, by never allowing home-made movies again.  And,  3.) if you do have a video preview department, fire them all and hire a new staff.  PS drug test them regularly!",1474848000,,955,4.5
