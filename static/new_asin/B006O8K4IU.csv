5008745,4,B006O8K4IU,"If you love this war-horse, have 20-30 recordings of it in various formats and are eager to hear it done justice to with new, relatively unfamiliar voices, this blu-ray will quench your thirst. However, if you want a big, impressive spectacle with top-notch production values in today's best technical standards look elsewhere. I'll list my observations in order of appearance, the order they hit your senses. The prelude is the most rushed and perfunctory I've heard and the orchestral playing indifferent. Mehta has been conducting this opera for about half a century. Is the message here ""let's get this prelude behind us, get on with the singing and get things moving along""? I think so, because Mehta does not disappoint, his pacing is perfect and attentive and the orchestra does warm up as the production comes together and they play as if they cared (for the most part). The tenor, Marco Berti - wow, un coup de foudre! He nails the difficult ""Celeste Aida"" with abandon, gorgeous tone and style, great ping and a rare impression of ease, it sounds like it's a cakewalk for him and he's thrilling (no final high B-flat diminuendo - Botha goes for it on the recent MET blu-ray and for that he will inherit the glory of the  kingdom of heaven to come). He's not exactly new and unfamiliar; his MET debut was in 2004, he's been around and is featured on several recordings and DVD's, but I never heard him sing that well. The rest of the evening he keeps it almost on that level, but not quite. Luciana D'intino's Amneris is good. She too has been around, her MET debut was in 2005 and with Dolora Zajick around you don't feel there is exactly a famine in Amnerislandia, but she's good, better than most Amnerises you're likely to hear today anywhere.

At this point in the performance you are hyperventilating how the Aida will turn out. I missed Hui He's MET debut as Aida so I checked her Aida on youtube, and based on what I heard I decided to purchase this blu-ray. She is first rate. When this was filmed last year she has sung aida for 11 years including in LA , in Verona and at the MET in 2010 (scheduled to repeat it this year). I played her Ritorna vincitor twice to absorb it. She has a refulgent rich tone, solid from top to bottom; she has the style, the legato, the projection, the stamina and she nails 95% of the twists and turns of the score. The rest of the cast is good, no complaints, I enjoyed this performance.

The staging is on the traditional end of the spectrum. Within that margin it is on the low-budget end of the spectrum (this was filmed after the budget cuts in Italy). It is in fact risible, the ballets are worse than risible. The Sacred Dance of the Priestesses is disgusting. They have a huge furry beast with an open wound on the altar; a priestess stabs it repeatedly and ...ugh, I closed my eyes, I don't know how it ended, but if you read Leviticus, the part of the instructions for the priest how to perform the sacrifice, it's not much different (except that there are no priestesses in Leviticus). Wouldn't it have been nicer if they had the maidens slaughtered instead and sacrificed? However, der Herr Regisseur must come up with Ein Konzept and I think the Konzept here is that war is cruel, or just ""Cruelty"" (Radams looks in the end like he was interrogated by Scarpia's henchmen). It looks like the most complicated decision der Herr Regisseur had to make in this production was whether Amonastro will eavesdrop on the lovers from the right and Amneris will surprise them from the left, or the other way around. Which one is better, actually? Has anyone ever tried having Amonastro interrupt them from the auditorium's aisle, climbing up to the stage, and have Amneris rise up from the stage floor Erda-like? A small variation of this (for bigger budgets) could have Amonastro land down to the stage from a Zeppelin.  Now THAT is deep; I'm going to copyright this idea. There isn't much acting, the singers mostly stand and deliver, sometimes making funny faces. However I did glean an important detail regarding the demise of the doomed lovers in the final scene. I always thought that being executed by being ""entombed alive"" means that they stand and sing in the sealed underground vault until they run out of oxygen. I was wrong; this production clarifies that ""A te vivo fia schiuso l'avel"" means ""sepolto nella sabbia"", buried alive (in sand). This demonstration of the technical aspect of the execution is very useful.

The blu-ray has an average bitrate that is less than half of that of an average blu-ray. The image isn't sharp but there isn't much to look at anyway. This blu-ray is a definite top contender for your 20th or 30th Aida. But seriously, if this were the 50's or 60's, and this very cast were assembled for a carefully planned studio recording, the recording would be counted today as a Historic Performance from a Golden Age of singing.",1329609600,5,4916,4.626575028636885
8501623,3,B006O8K4IU,"If you can listen to Aida and not be moved by the music, something is wrong. As mentioned in the other reviews, the acting is lacking in this production. The sets are impressive but the costumes are sometimes close to humorous. The acting is dour. Hui He reminds me of the angry mom in a sitcom. ""Go do your homework!""  The bloody kid dancing around is gratuitous.

But it's all about the music, right? In my opinion, the music gets lost in the big sets, funny costumes and sour faced singers. There is no warmth. Aida is packed with lush, warm music. The arias are piercing in this production. I cut the volume a couple times in fear my glasses were going to shatter.

The gold standard is the old Met production with Domingo. This opera needs Latin warmth.

Final gripe. Why must producers inject some ""statement"" into these operas? Why can't they just produce them as written? Is that sacrifice scene really necessary? Do we need the bloody kid flopping all over the stage  while the frozen cast looks on as though wondering if she's somebody's kid from the audience? Some may like this stuff. I don't. Play 'em straight.",1415059200,,1124,4.5721393034825875

8501625,5,B006O8K4IU,"Aida is probably Verdi's most popular opera. Evan today after some 140 years it is still being produced somewhere all the time. My grandfather was an extra in the Triumphal March in the late 1890s in Defiance Ohio (his only opera). I'm sure most everyone can tell a similar story.
It's popularity was such that Verdi, already a wealthy man became a very wealthy man. It is one lovely melody after another and as an opera is one of Verdi's most conservative and conventional. From it's opening music for Radames ""Celeste Aida""(a conventional aria type) grand scale ceremonial scenes, large scale multi-sectioned duets (there are several), lack of character development (with the possible exception of Amneris) this is a  highly conservative score. There is however one radical element that is the key to its popularity -""local color"". This is the ambiance in harmony and instrumentation that constantly reafirms its exotic locale. As one critic put it ""if this isn't what Egyptian music sounded like, it should have.""
My history with Aida starts with grandmother's wind-up Victrola and the cactus needles with Tetrazzini and Caruso etc. My first opera Aida- Renata Tebaldi and Franco Corelli in the 1950s. Both were beautiful people that looked the part and sang superbly (a rare combination). Since then I've seen dozens of staged versions and have had dozens and dozens of 78s, LPs, CDs and DVDs and now blu-rays. There are many excellent productions available and this disc is one of them.
The key to success of this disc is the conductor Zubin Mehta. I've seen him conduct for years: symphonies and operas and they have always come out as excellent. In this production the first act was a bit slow to gel and you could see it on his face. The second, third and fourth were much better and the total effect was a great experience.
The principals were Italian leaders in the field with the exception of the Aida, Hui He. She may be oriental but she sang a very excellent, very italianate rendition of this taxing role. A great, smooth voice, she was able to project through chorus and orchestra with unfailing clarity.
The Amneris of Luciana D'Intino was another triumph. She is an experienced singer with a good mezzo command and developed her part very well. Amneris is the lynch-pin of the whole drama; it is her jealousy that sets the tragedy in motion and she is left with the ultimate remorse. Luciana carried the day with verve.
The male parts were for the most part well done. Marco Berti is a big-chested Italian tenor in the Pavarotti mode. He sings well but certainly doesn't look the part of a heart throb. His ""terra adio"" duet with He was a beautiful and a fit ending for a wonderful opera experience. Ambrogio Maestri seems to be all over the place these days. His recording of Falstaff is a hit and he is doing it at the Met. He makes an impresive Amonasro. He looks like he could lead an army of ruffians. Giacomo Prestia sounded better as Ramfis than he has in several recent performances. His wobble was under control.
This 2011 recording is worth getting and playing again and again. And add it to the several other recordings that you have. Each is good in its way.
My favorite DVD? 1981 Arena di Verona. Maria Chiara - a really good Aida and looked the part. Fiorenza Cossotto great- you could really learn to hate her. Nicola Martinucci he really looks like a Radames and sang it well too! And the production was stupendous. No budget restraints as this one did. Cast of hundreds! Gold everywhere! I and about 12,000 other people really enjoyed it. It defined GRAND OPERA.",1383609600,2,3596,4.735247208931419
8501626,3,B006O8K4IU,"I found this production to be almost unbearably static -- it's very much a stand-pose--and-deliver performance, and Zubin Mehta seems totally bored and perfuctory.  The Triumphal March gets very short shrift compared to other productions.  There is one very astonishing effect at the very end of the opera having to do with the entombed lovers.  I won't reveal it here, lest I spoil it for first-time viewers, but it's something I haven't seen so dramatically realized in other productions.  I only wish the rest of the production had been nearly as arresting.  I'm still looking for a rewarding blu-ray Aida.",1369008000,,609,5.05
8501627,5,B006O8K4IU,"A beautiful version of Aida, from the Maggio Musicale in Florence 2011. This version is quite different from the Met versions. No circus effects like horses etc, just pure opera at its best. The scenes are candy for the eye, particularly the Nile scene. Hui He as Aida has perhaps not an acting talent like Aprile Millo or Violetta Urmana, but her voice is really nice. Luciana D'Intino as Amneris is far more pleasant to listen to than Dolora Zajick. Italian tenor Marco Berti has all the voice necessary for the Radams role. The recorded sound is great. So go for this Aida!",1364428800,,576,4.601941747572815
8501628,5,B006O8K4IU,"This is done so beautifully!  Beautiful voices, wonderful acting, especially by the female lead.  I have watched this over and over - and cry every time!  So beautiful.",1358553600,6,168,4.928571428571429
8501629,5,B006O8K4IU,"Having viewed and re-viewed this DVD, I have come to conclusion that in terms of current Verdian singers, there is simply too few that could out-sing Marco Berti or Hui He, respectively the Radames and Aida in this performance.
In the opening Celeste Aida, Berti pours forth in a timbre with just the right amount of squillo and lyricism that one seldom hears these days (for the past decade).  Here and there, very sparingly, one tight high note creeps in, but only fleetingly and undamagingly.  Here is a true Verdian tenor, who luckily, has his voice 'saved' until his 50th year (he's born in 1962 January) for the real big roles and who has not 'squandered' his vocal goods in the earlier years. He is now truly ripe for the Verdian roles like Radames in 'Aida', Gustavo in 'Un Ballo', Mantua in 'Rigoletto', Ernani, Steffilio, if not Alfredo in 'La Traviata' or Manrico in 'Il Trovatore'.  One certainly hope that Berti can be more dramatically alert in his acting, but with a good director, such is not impossible.
Hui He as Aida is fully convincing and dramatically affecting. As one commentary has it - her Nile scene is so passionately rendered that the water of the Nile simply simmers. Here is a Verdian soprano singing in her absolute prime. It is trite to note that the entire Act III of this recording is being dominated by her Aida, with Maestri and Berti in singularly capable partnerships with her in turn: Maestri vocally as well as dramatically; Berti vocally if not dramatically.
The production does not focus merely on the grandiose of this work - it focuses on the humane side and indirectly denounces military biligerance.
A highly recommended DVD of Verdi's masterpiece.",1338249600,14,1694,4.794520547945205
8501630,4,B006O8K4IU,"This DVD of Aida is probably one of the most even in terms of singing that one could find on the market, spanning from the days of the great Luciano Pavarotti, given that even Pav in his time did NOT have as good an Aida as one could probably find here in Hui He.
In the major supporting role, Amneris is sung by veteran mezzo-soprano Luciana D'Intino, who reprises this role since the late 1980's with Cheryl Studer as Aida.
While Hui He may not be most verbally incisive Aida, her performance here sets her way above many other lyrical spinto sopranos who have undertaken this role: Maria Chiara, Cheryl Studer, Violetta Urmana, and more lately Sondra Radvanovsky, though not yet recorded.
Hui He's impassioned performance of this role is fully enhanced by her shimmering lirico spinto voice, which is fully lyrical without the slightest edginess that marrs other spinto sopranos like Urmana and Radvanovsky. Yet her timbre is at the same full-bodied and rich throughout all registers, which is a real marvel. Her duet with the veteran D'Intino is the first bit of evidence of her seemingly endless vocal prowess, and her Nile scene culminating in her great rendition of 'O Patri Mia' is outright the greatest rendition heard since the days of Monseratt Caballe who recorded this role for Ricardo Muti in the early 1980's.
Her duet with Amonasro is the third piece of concrete evidence of her fully convincing portrayal of the emotionally torned Aida.  The final death scene with Radames on the other hand witnesses her superb lyricism in this role after a full-length emotionally-charged performance of Aida.
As Radames, Marco Berti has all the vocal goods - squillo, pitch and range.  He is, however, not as convincing in terms of acting, being a more stolid stage presence than most members of this cast.
As Amonasro, Ambrogio Maestri is very effective, giving a hair-standing duet with Aida.
The sets and costumes are very elegant, if not outright grand.
Zubin Mehta takes veteran reign over the entire show, if a bit on the stolid side.",1336953600,10,2043,4.867816091954023
8501631,4,B006O8K4IU,"I find little to fault the conducting of Zubin Mehta in this Florence Aida production.  Mehta knows the stuff inside out, and he paces the dramatic nuances with real circumspection.
The sets are elegant, if not outright grandiose.  Particularly worthy of mention is the lighting and make-up for the singers.
In the vocal cast, D'Intino as Amneris is to be considered as a late reprisal, the former one being made on DVD in 1996!  While not as vocally fresh as she then was, her singing is still a tour de force in the category of Verdian mezzo-soprano.
As the hero Radames, Berti sings everything right.  Not nearly one single instance of vocal misjudgment could be evident.  That said, his voice is not the most beautiful of Verdian tenors, but his characterisation is still fully convincing.
As Amonasro, Maestri is perhaps the most vocally (and visually) convincing member of the male cast. Prestia as Ramfis runs close to him in the low male-voice category.
In the title role, Chinese soprano Hui He gives a truly convincing portrayal of Aida. Her timbre is lyrical and expressive, full in the middle to low register, and burnished in the top register.  Hui He characterises Aida as the faithful lover, the dutiful daughter, the patriotic princess, and most importantaly, the tragic heroine who would sacrifice even her life for love.  All these traits she nmanages to portray with her highly effective vocal acting.
The ensemble work of this performance is also beautifully done.
If we but have three similarly effective lead singers, this would be a truly top rate performance.",1335139200,6,1583,4.950943396226415
8501632,3,B006O8K4IU,"Aida is a tricky opera to stage effectively.  It doesn't hold up well to modernisation or revisionism, demanding a very specific mood and setting that one messes with at one's peril.  I've seen it done before in a Risorgimento updating to Verdi's time and in Robert Wilson's particular minimalist style, both of which were interesting, but neither were entirely successful.  On the other hand, a traditional approach to Aida requires both a big stage to match the grandeur of Verdi's compositions of ceremonial marches through ancient monuments, and not everyone has the budget to go for the Full Zeffirelli.  Even then however, the lack of dramatic incident and the demands placed on the singers mean that even a traditional setting can be rather static.  Directed by Turkish-Italian filmmaker Ferzan Ozpetek, the Florence production of Aida, recorded here in 2011, tends towards the traditional and looks marvellous, but in how it approaches those other considerable challenges that a staging of the opera presents, it unfortunately falls well short of the mark.

That's disappointing from a musical point of view, particularly as we have as distinguished a musical director as Zubin Metha conducting the orchestra, for if there's at least one thing you would hope to count on from any production of Aida, it's that it presents a vigorous account of Verdi's dynamic score.  Aida is one of the most melodic and memorable of late Verdi operas, with hints of grand opera influence, but it's also one that is attuned to the emotional content of the drama with an exotic flavour for its Egyptian setting.  The performance initially feels somewhat perfunctory, for the first Act at least, a run-through with no real commitment on the part of the musicians or the conductor.  It improves in subsequent acts, warming to the characters and their situation, but there's never a sense that Metha is able to get the orchestra to do full justice to the dynamic theatricality of Verdi's majestic score.

If that's the case - and it's only my opinion - it's at least in step with the lack of dynamism elsewhere in the production.  The stage sets, designed by Dante Ferretti, look marvellous - grand statues and monuments bathed in golden light, with colourful sunsets and deep blue moonlit night scenes - and the costumes are traditional and exotic.  Stage director Ferzan Ozpetek however is unable to find anything for the singers do on stage but stand and project out to an audience, while priests and choruses stand grouped or march in solemn procession.  There's no question of there being any acting involved.  Only once is there a suggestion of anything with imagination and that occurs briefly when the traditional pomp and patriotic fervour of the Triumphal March is initially undercut by the appearance on the stage of a young bloodstained child, looking bewildered by the celebration of the slaughter that has occurred.  It's a throwaway touch however, soon forgotten under the more traditional, but not particularly imaginatively choreographed battle ballet that follows.

Again, a lack of drama or ideas on the stage wouldn't be much of a problem - it's one of the issues with Aida - if only the singers were capable of making up for the slack elsewhere.  Unfortunately, there's not much in the way of strong singing to sufficiently redeem this production.  Marco Bertii has a fine tone of voice as Radams, but his technique is all off and his 'Celeste Aida' is a struggle.  He comes through however in Act IV where it counts.  Luciana D'Intino is a weak Amneris, her singing shrill and unpleasant, without sufficient force or personality to carry the role - an unfortunate drawback, since it's this character who has perhaps the most important central role in the opera.  Hui Hei's Aida is about the best there is here, her Act III duets coming over well, particularly her duet with a fine Ambrogio Maestri as Amanasro.  Without a strong enough Amneris however to hammer home Act IV after the rallying that comes through from the cast and orchestra in Act III, it's all to little avail.

There are no extra features on the Blu-ray, so the single-layer BD25 is generally fine for the two-and-a-half hour opera.  The image quality is excellent throughout, 1080i full-HD, with only a little sign of compression artefacts during a couple of faster pans of the camera.  The audio tracks are the customary PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 and there's a decent tone and clarity to both.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, German, French, Spanish and Korean.  The disc is All Region.",1331164800,5,4582,4.955555555555556
