That would put anyone in a really bad mood(to say the least)! It would fill anyone with despair. That is, if you were caught in such a predicament by chance or accidentally. However what would you call someone who willingly enters such a situation out of his own volition, not because he is a famed adventurer, the likes of Indiana Jones, but purely out of love for God and his fellow brothers and sisters. A madman? A dreamer? The church has a name for such people and she calls them Saints.

This documentary on the life of Fr. Clemente Vismara seems straight out of a Hollywood saga. After having served in the First World War, he answers the divine call to be a labourer in God's forsaken vineyard, a land thousands of miles away far from his native Italy, a land named Burma. Yet it is not amongst the exotic golden pagodas and the hustle and bustle of the streets of Rangoon that he would toil, but far away in the dense canopies of the tropical rain forest amid rugged terrain. Here the gospel of Jesus Christ is proclaimed not by the blast of a trumpet but by the gentle smile, the fatherly touch and the genuine love for his littlest brothers and sisters. Not only would he establish a mission to educate the tribal peoples of this area, he would also ransom the children of these people, those children who were abandoned and orphaned, who were destined to be sold as if they were cattle. Thus this ransoming would be twofold; the spiritual ransoming from the clutches of the devil and being ransomed from a life of ignorance and poverty filled with despair. His success in this mission along with his example as well as his many correspondences to his homeland that would bring subsequent missionaries to Burma, as well as foster holy vocations among the indigenous people of this area.

This 30 minute documentary is replete with eye witness testimonies to the sanctity of this man of God, from the very children he saved, the villagers and parishioners as well as colleagues who knew him. What is astounding is that for most past the generation that is above thirty years old knows him, thus making him a truly modern saint. Also interviewed are the beneficiaries of miracles that were attributed to the intercession of Fr. Clemente. Archival video footage and photographs of Father Vismara enhance the viewing experience.

This documentary does not have any special features , scene selections nor subtitles.

Fr. Clemente Vismara was beatified  on the 26th of June 2011.

In the midst of this brutal self centered modern world, the example of this holy man shines out like a luminous tower inviting all of us to a life of sacrifice, charity and joy in the service of our fellow man. This documentary, short  may it be, is definitely rich in its spiritual depth and will fill its viewer with a profound love and respect for those brave men and women of God, who traverse the ends of the earth to bring love and hope.

Blessed Clemente Vismara, Patriarch of Burma and modern apostle, pray for us!",1384214400,3,3268,4.69109947643979
