1904452,5,B0000AC8L8,"Those 2 gems are a must have on blu ray.
 First of all we get one of the best italian zombie splatters.
 Virus aka hell of the living dead although has poor gore is one of the best B-MOVIES of all time.
 Then we get RATS - NIGHT OF TERROR which is the best rats movie ever made.
 One of the scarriest movies ever which i saw in a theater back in 84 and then i slept with lights on.
 The scenes in which the rats are eating their victims in their sleeping bags are AWESOME.
 Also the twist in the end is unpredictable.

 If u love splatter b-movies then this blu ray is for you.

 I JUST WANNA KNOW IF THIS IS A REGION FREE BLU RAY....ANYONE KNOWS ?",1403913600,6,648,3.9153846153846152
1904453,2,B0000AC8L8,"I did watch both of these movies. They weren't that good in my opinion. I sold the set immediately after viewing both of them. Nothing really good to see here, or write anything good about. They were watchable, not that great, but I have seen worse. Don't get this set unless you find it at a flea market for 2.00 or 3.00. Even 3 bucks may be too much for these. 1.8 out of 5",1381795200,,375,4.013333333333334
1904454,4,B0000AC8L8,"Italian director Bruno Mattei was a great visionary of apocalyptic horror.  He is famous for directing low budget exploitation films such as the ones presented in this double feature from Anchor Bay: ""Hell of the Living Dead"" and ""Rats."" Both films have excellent premises but are harmed mostly by inferior special effects.

  In ""Hell of the Living Dead,"" grainy stock footage from a New Guinea documentary is clumsily inserted into the film.  It serves little purpose but to slow down the pace.  According to commentary from Mattei, ""Hell of the Living Dead"" was highly influenced by ""Dawn of the Dead"" - a collaboration between directors George Romero and Dario Argento.  In fact, some scenes, especially the elevator one at the Hope plant, appeared to be imitations from ""Dawn of the Dead.""  Furthermore, Mattei used the famous rock band Goblin which performed for ""Dawn of the Dead"" and numerous Italian gialli (murder mysteries) directed by Dario Argento.

  ""Rats"" also was harmed by inferior special effects that could've been omitted without harming the plot.  One in particular was what appeared to be a cardboard cutout of rats going up and down as if on a merry go round that simulated them running en mass.

  Both films are set in the future and involve apocalyptic disasters.  In ""Hell of the Living Dead,"" an experimental gas is released from the Hope plant which turns humans into flesh eating zombies.  In ""Rats,"" uncouth bikers are trapped inside a laboratory where scientists have been experimenting on mutating rats.  This film, according to Mattei, is based on George Romero's ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" except it has rats in lieu of zombies.  The incredible twist ending makes this film worth watching.

  This double feature from Anchor Bay is an excellent introduction to the exploitation works of Bruno Mattei.  It is highly recommended for fans of low budget Italian films.  Though not on the same level as Dario Argento or Mario Bava, they are still influential.  If you can find this out-of-print double feature at a reasonable price, I recommend that you purchase it.  Just don't watch it while trying to eat, especially during ""Hell of the Living Dead.""",1240704000,,2189,4.9779005524861875
1904455,4,B0000AC8L8,"contained in this set are two films, from italian filmakers bruno mattei, and claudio fraggaso; working here under the pseudonyms ""vincent dawn(bruno), and clyde anderson(claudio). fraggaso is probably best known for directing the epicly hilarious troll 2. mattei is the weakest link in this creative duo. unfortunately, he directs both of these with fraggaso providing the scripts. don't even waste your time watching hell of the living dead, it's incredibly slow paced, and comprised in large part, from stock footage. rats: night of terror, on the other hand, is solid gold start to finish! a post apocalyptic tale, ala' mad max, it's a story of bikers vs. highly evolved, super intelligent rats. fast paced, and side splittinly hilarious dialogue make this a must have.",1220486400,,773,5.241935483870968
1904456,3,B0000AC8L8,"Anchor Bay brings us a Drive-In double feature with two Bruno Mattei Euro-shlock classics!

First, a scientific experiment goes wrong at a lab in New Guinea resulting in the outbreak of a deadly virus with horrifying symptoms. The disease spreads quickly, and soon the island is overrun by flesh-eating zombies. When a commando squad shows up on the island without knowing the situation, they proceed on dead reckoning, picking up an attractive television reporter and her cameraman along the way. Those that survive make their way to the Hope Centre laboratory where the disease originated to discover it's dark purpose.

""Hell of the Living Dead,"" AKA ""Virus,"" AKA ""Zombi 4,"" AKA ""Zombi 5: Ultimate Nightmare,"" AKA ""Zombie Creeping Flesh"" and a slew of other names, is, in many ways, your typical Italian ""Dawn of the Dead"" wannabe. There's plenty of cannibalistic gore, a swat team, lots of shooting, and they even borrow the music by Goblin. The film also uses stock footage to give the impression that it takes place in New Guinea when it was actually shot in Spain (it's not THAT badly done though). Nevertheless, ""Hell of the Living Dead"" is somehow more engaging than other films of its type. Perhaps it's the characters, badly dubbed as they are (hate that UN scene). Perhaps it's the breasts. For some, it's probably the butcher shop gore and crocodile gutting scene. There's also the origin of the disease that is revealed at the end, which I think definitely takes the film up a notch. I also love that the film includes a final scene, similar to what Fulci did in ""Zombie"" though not quite as grand, showing that the virus has moved out of the jungle and on to a highly populated area, as I personally prefer seeing zombie films set in more civilized locales to the jungle zombie films. It's just scarier when you see it happening in an area that looks more familiar to you. Overall, if you enjoy zombie films you should see this one, and especially if you're a fan of the Italian entries into the genre.

Next, set in the year 215 A.B. (after the bomb), ""Rats"" is the story of a group of motorcycle riding nomads who travel around scavenging the leftover cities of the world that have become ghost towns. Most humans never resurfaced after going underground to avoid the radiation all those years before, but the biker gang soon discovers that the humans moving underground forced the world's rat population above ground, and it is they who now hold power over us!

Putting his own spin on Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead,"" famed European schlock-horror director Bruno Mattei replaces zombies with rats and takes us into the future to a world turned upside down. If that sounds intriguing to you, you may want to give this one a look, but be prepared for the worst. Everything about this one is pretty bad (and kinda gross) except for the twist ending and some of the general concept itself. It's all in good fun if you enjoy bad movies though, but one sort of feels this would have been more effective as part of an anthology since it really doesn't need to be feature length.

This great looking double-sided DVD from Anchor Bay includes ""Hell Rats of the Living Dead"" (an interview with director Bruno Mattei), a Bruno Mattei bio, a still and poster gallery, and theatrical trailers. Films are presented in widescreen format.",1197331200,,3345,4.750430292598967
1904457,2,B0000AC8L8,"HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka: Night Of The Zombies) concerns a chemical plant disaster that turns the folks in New Guinea into zombified, flesh-eating maniacs! A commando team is dispatched to solve the problem, but runs into difficulty when the zombies attack. Along the way, our heroes meet a female scientist / reporter who sheds her clothing in order to relate to the local native tribes! She's fairly hot, but the endless stock footage of natives dancing around drains much of the enjoyment! Speaking of stock footage, since HOTLD was filmed in Spain, the director filled the movie w/ many poorly added scenes of diving pelicans, leaping monkeys, etc. for (unnecessary and dull) padding. This movie would have made a far better 30-45 min. short film! RATS: NIGHT OF TERROR is about a group of futuristic bikers and their battle against an army of deadly vermin. The ""gang"" looks suspiciously similar to those overly made-up ""punks"" from 1980s MTV videos. With names like Lucifer, Duke, Chocolate, and Video, these clowns are as goofy as they sound! The actual rats are lethargic and timid throughout, that is until they are tossed onto someone, or blasted by a flame-thrower! Oh well, only desperate rats could love this moldy old cheezelog! As a double feature, I found watching both movies to be a tedious chore. Good luck...",1184025600,,1332,4.924444444444444
1904458,4,B0000AC8L8,"Hell of the living dead is not a perfect zombie movie, but if you're looking for a horror flick with apocalyptic atmopshere with gut munchin' and head blowin' action, this is it. Sure, it's cheesy, but fun as a whistle. If you liked Burial Ground, Zombie, Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, then this one is a gem.  Goblin is on the soundtrack, the one ripped off from Dawn of the Dead.
...I don't care what people say, the movie works--5 STARS!
Rats, on the other hand, is a film where every death scene is so off it's not funny or cool. The main characters come off as goofy super-heroes (one by the name of 'video'). The rat action is mis-guided and comical, the director didn't believe in realism whatsover with the gore effects and character reaction--the dubbing doens't help either. I give this DVD 2 stars by itself, but Hell of the Living Dead is so awesome, it's a good deal to get two DVDs for the price of one.",1088640000,4,913,4.402366863905326

7996482,4,B0000AC8L8,"two shlock films for the price of one!.  I am a huge fan of italian movies.  And umberto lenzi remains one of my faovrite directors from that country. However this was done by another directer.  Buneia mateo. And he's doing the best he could with budgets far under lenzi's level. So we get two very low budget films that are in the so bad it's good realm. And in 'hell of the living dead' we get horrible nature footage of some small animal screaming in terror as it's killed.  Rats doesn't do this , but it's still a shlock movie with bad effects and dialog.  Hell is better , but it's use of real footage is a way to fill up screen time.  Even jess franco wouldn't do that.  but the director , was trying on a small budget to get things done.  Or he was a true shlock miiester.  This is not part of the cool zombi series either.  Those ffilms 'dawn of hte dead'  zobie 2 , and zombi 3 and four are great to ok.  Italian movie making is largely gone today, and the giallo craze was replaced by horror for a while and this is in that period.  with them making money on zombies and this was even more exploitive . both of these movies have never looked so good as on this blu ray either.  Except if you saw them in a grindhouse on the first day before the film was worn down.",1454284800,,1274,4.084677419354839

If you wanted to add these to your sci-fi/horror collection, then they're okay. If you have the SDs of them...don't upgrade!

HotLD is the first BD that has parts of scenes that move. Cheaply authored SDs have that anomoly, which I thought was inherent to SDs, but I guess cheap authoring is cheap authoring. Didn't think Blue Underground did that, but I guess they do.",1414972800,,481,4.454545454545454
7996488,3,B0000AC8L8,"Overall I thought the picture quality was top notch but very disappointed with the sound.firstly the music parts of 'hell of the living dead'seemed very disjointed compared with the dvd prints I have of this movie- it's as though a few seconds of footage have been cut out between some scenes because the beat of the music dosnt flow.(fans of this movie will know what I'm trying to get at.compare it with your dvd print)
Secondly.the title sequence says...recorded in dolby stereo...if this print is taken from the negative that holds a stereo soundtrack then why the 'hell'didnt they form some sort of 5.1 or 7.1 mix with it.this soundtrack is screaming out for it....it was done with 'living dead at Manchester morgue'.and ""zombie' why not this one.",1412553600,2,752,4.8828125
7996489,5,B0000AC8L8,"Here are two Italian shockers that are as different as Night and Day. HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD is a zombie film that is so bad, you can't help but laugh and enjoy it. RATS: NIGHT OF TERROR is a blood-soaked futuristic look at killer rats when a motorcycle gang (with hilarious names) stop at a post-apocalyptic town and are eaten by the hungry buggers. Be prepared for an ending you will never see coming. Those Italians sure knew how to turn out entertaining junk food in the 70's & 80's. Both films are recommended for different reasons and both are gory as hell. Nice to finally have both these films on Blu-Ray.",1409270400,4,614,4.442477876106195
