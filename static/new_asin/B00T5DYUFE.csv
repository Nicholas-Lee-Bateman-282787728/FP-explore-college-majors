7000758,3,B00T5DYUFE,"In ancient times Isobel Redwood (Danielle Bux) is accused of killing her son and is hung as a witch. Her body is cut up into 9 pieces and buried. The tree is cursed as is the house/ pig farm  of St. Jonas. Other children die there and dare others to touch the tree. A mom (Sarah Rose Denton) with two children Emma (Lucy Clarvis) and Jake (Lawrence Weller) unknowingly move into St. Jonas. Neighborhood bullies force Jake to play Ouija Board in the barn with the expected negative results.

The film starts off interesting and maintains interest in spite of the lame mother. The characters were not really developed that well. I enjoyed the ghost/witch/haunting story watching it cold without reading the back cover. (Okay I did read the back cover but quickly forgot it.) The problem with the back cover and IMDB is that the second word is a plot spoiler which ruins the twist. It is like knowing the twist in ""The Other"" before you watch it. If you plan on watching the film, don't read about it.

Guide: F-bomb, sex? nudity (Lucy Jane Clarvis) 3 1/2 STARS",1432598400,2,1058,4.557894736842106
7000759,1,B00T5DYUFE,"I was looking for a horror film at Megalo Mart. I got taken in by the art work on the front and backside of the DVD. Creative and creepy. Then I watched it. Maybe one day the writer, producer and director (1 fella) of this film will be making great movies. But this appears to be a first time effort. After a few minutes of it I groaned that I had paid $ for this.",1432512000,2,364,3.8666666666666667
7000760,1,B00T5DYUFE,Too slow  a bunch of fake dreams  and imagination thats not happing in the movie you think somethings going to happen and its only image or a  dream  I would not recommend this at all  it drags slow its likena movie showing commercials of horrorfilms,1432339200,2,250,4.466666666666667
7000761,1,B00T5DYUFE,Got this from wallmart. Watched 10 minutes of it  then threw it in the trash sucks.,1431993600,4,83,4.1875
7000762,5,B00T5DYUFE,"Curse of the Witching Tree is an excellent low budget horror film - extremely well acted, sensitively written and beautifully shot.  James Crow does a brilliant job of slowly building the tension and allowing for genuine character development so that the audience are totally drawn in to the young family's story.  Rarely have I seen a low budget horror film that is quite as sophisticated and nuanced in its performances and character-driven dialogue, but still retains that edge of your seat fear factor.  I laughed, I cried and I was scared....!",1431907200,5,548,5.0

7000767,3,B00T5DYUFE,"I like ""B"" movies. This was not exactly what I expected though.  It was more yuck than creepy.  I want to be scared from ghost stories not nauseated.  This didn't have that jump at the first noise outside effect I like in a scary movie.  Would qualify as horror not ghost story on my scale.  Was ok for horror.",1438646400,,310,4.186440677966102
7000768,5,B00T5DYUFE,good story decent acting exciting movie that it worth the watch I just bought it on dvd,1438387200,2,87,4.176470588235294
7000769,4,B00T5DYUFE,It starts out three children around A camp fire at night one tells A spooky story about A witch and A curse she left before dying but only if someone touches the tree she was hung at.  Time passes A family moves into the farm where the woman came from soon after strange things start to happen which leads to A very chilling movie and the ending was A surprise.,1437264000,,361,4.1571428571428575

8700416,1,B00T5DYUFE,Waste of time and money. Worse quality than a student film. Cheesy. Terrible writing. Worth less than nothing.,1477699200,,110,5.166666666666667

8700420,4,B00T5DYUFE,"This was a lot of fun. Tended to lag in parts, and overall I'd just say it could be a touch shorter, but it delivered. Creepy, fun, a good one to put on on Halloween or something.",1451520000,,179,3.864864864864865
8700421,5,B00T5DYUFE,"Rented this movie from Red box and then ordered it from Amazon. The atmosphere was good, the story was all right except I could care less about the comatose dad. The bullies were a little overdone but the actress playing the daughter is HOT! The bath obscene...enough said. If you like low budget then get this",1451174400,,310,4.553571428571429

8700424,3,B00T5DYUFE,"Meh - this one's a bit odd... it really wants to be an intelligent psychological horror film, but never quite crosses over from a largely dull viewing experience. The acting, however, and cinematography are both very, very good.",1445040000,,228,5.026315789473684
8700425,2,B00T5DYUFE,"Reminded me of  far better films like The Orphanage and Blair Witch, etc...  mediocre acting of one dimensional characters, Most of the dialogue is delivered like an court room reporter in low tone. That's not always a weakness in a film but it make this particular one hard to stay awake through.  I spent much of the time making fun of it, deciding who each character looked like.  The main kid in the film looks like Johnny Crawford from The Rifleman and Space Children fame.  There was the 80s pop singer Adam Ant, Sean Penn, and a few others in there.",1442102400,,556,4.465346534653466
