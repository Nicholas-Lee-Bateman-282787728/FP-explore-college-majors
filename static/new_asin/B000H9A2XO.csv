2632340,5,B000H9A2XO,"If you are in love with Jun Ji Hyun, then this movie is what the doctor ordered. It may be a sappy love story but Jun Ji Hyun never looked better.
I've seen all of her movies except her latest Blood:The Last Vampire. In my opinion Windstruck and Il Mare are as good as My Sassy Girl. If you aren't a huge Jun Ji Hyun fan or a fan of Korean tear jerkers, then Windstruck is probably not for you.

The soundtrack is great. Tears by X Japan is awesome.",1245110400,9,449,3.988888888888889
2632341,2,B000H9A2XO,"This begins promisingly -- with a beautiful flyover of nighttime Seoul (I think) to Korean singer Youme's beautiful rendition of Bob Dylan's ""Knocking on Heaven's Door"" -- in heavily accented English. The music sound track would often excel over the storyline with effective uses of Satie's ""Gymnopedie No. 1"" and Maurice William's ""Stay"" and original compositions by Choi Seung-hyun.

There are other take-your-breath-away pictorial moments provided by director Kwak Jae-young and cinematographer Jeong Han-cheol. Unfotunately the mixed bag of a story includes thievery of the terrific&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MY-SASSY-GIRL/dp/B000FTDVCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MY SASSY GIRL</a>&nbsp;(also with actress Jun Ji Hyun), overcooked comedy, chases and gunfights, teary melodrama and a dollop of GHOST. While some of it is okay, the parts fit together like pieces from different jigsaw puzzles. Then there's the ending relies on being familiar with MY SASSY GIRL to get the full meaning. Couldn't these people write their own movie?! (Yes, I know that Kwak Jae-young directed both - but while he wrote this story - he based his screenplay for MY SASSY GIRL on a popular novel - so some plagiarism may have been involved.)

Other than its music, the only justification for this movie is to give Jun Ji Hyun some screen time. And that's justification enuf. This tall, lithe actress has an extremely potent screen presence with her quirky persona, no-nonsense talent and offbeat prettiness -- and is about the only woman I've seen who looks terrific in a police uniform. It's sheer joy to visit with her again.

If you absolutely must fill out your collection of Jun Ji Hyun movies, you've already made your decision (and I understand). If you absolutely love the Korean romantic comedy/ drama/ weepie/ shootout /fairytale /supernatural blend of film -- you might really like this one.",1234656000,5,1932,5.5646258503401365
8137702,5,B000H9A2XO,One of my favorite Kdrama romcom!  It's very corny Asian humor so be open minded!,1470268800,,81,4.4
8137703,5,B000H9A2XO,"Loved this unusual,quirky, romantic film. I watched it after seeing Jang Hyuk in the kdrama ""Fated to Love You"", which is great.  As mentioned, the lead actress has a unique personality like you'd never see in an American romantic movie, and her relationship with a physics teacher (Jang Hyuk) is funny at first, and becomes very touching - with special kudos to the soundtrack and of course, the wind.",1444348800,,402,4.826086956521739
8137704,5,B000H9A2XO,"Classic gem.. As good as any American movie I have ever seen.. and much better than most.  A romantic comedy that draws you in with the loveable lead's fully half the movie, .. then once in their grip the real drama begins.  I will Always have a copy of this on my bookshelf.  No one can make a drama like the South Koreans can.  A timeless classic!  Korean movie with English subtitles.  Good video and perfect subtitles on this version.",1431388800,2,438,4.4125

8137707,5,B000H9A2XO,"Windstruck is about a female police officer who is mourning the death of her boyfriend. The movie features themes about love, moving forward after a loss of a loved one and hope for happiness after experiencing tragedy in life. The movie has a mix of drama and comedy. The story is good but far from being a classic. The performance of Gianna Jun in this film is truly exceptional as her portrayal of a sorrowing police officer is marked by sincerity. Viewers will get affected by the emotions she has expressed like her sorrow and anguish. This is definitely a great prequel to the Asian classic,My Sassy Girl.",1396742400,4,611,4.666666666666667

8137709,5,B000H9A2XO,"This movie was really impressive. I could relate to it because of some personal experiences that were somewhat similar to what is shown in the movie.

Yes, it is also a very very sad love story. But it is so beautiful, you cannot forget it. The music is wonderful and so in tune with the scenes it makes you cry, literally.

One may say that she, being a policewoman, would  be a lot more detached and behave more ""professionally"". But that would be an American stereotype that does not fit the Asian counterpart. Moreover, God forbid, anyone ever has to experience what and how it feels like holding the one you love in your arms and watching their life slowly fading away... but if you experienced that, you will certainly understand her behavior.

Knowing how it feels, I could not hold the tears while watching her desperately crying out loud into her radio handset begging for help... It really hurts to watch all that... And the music... sung in English with a heavy accent makes the scene a lot more haunting...

And somehow I sighed with relief when she finally got shot because she had now a chance to meet the one she loved once again.. - ""Dry your tears with love...""",1393632000,2,1178,4.537735849056604
8137710,4,B000H9A2XO,"I might be called a fan of Jun Ji-hyun. I own Il Mare, My Sassy Girl, Windstruck, Blood: The Last Vampire and The Thieves. I enjoy her acting. (She can be very sexy and cute in her commercials too.) I found that the sweet/tender scenes in this movie worked well. The comedy was a little broad and the sad scenes lasted too long. (The comedy in My Sassy Girl was over-the top too but I loved it.) I enjoyed the part where the 5 princes were guessing which finger she had behind her back and the quick joke were the Captain/Chief was looking for Detective Kim. I laughed out loud at the tip of the hat to My Sassy Girl at the end of this movie but reconsidered after I thought about it. If someone hasn't seen MSG it would be wasted. For me it was like the director or producer was saying ""Aren't we clever"" and taking the easy way out to resolve that story line. I enjoyed the movie and will watch it again sometime - probably more than once.",1363651200,,941,4.175824175824176
