5087436,5,B007I1Q4MM,Great Dvd from magic school bus. My girls simply enjoy the shows daily and it is educational and fun. They couldn't stop watching and looking forward to different episodes daily!,1345161600,,178,4.966666666666667
5087437,5,B007I1Q4MM,"My kids love these; they laugh at them.  And they're educational, so I love them too, and we can talk about them at the end.  But I'm surprised that Amazon isn't competing on price.  Amazon charges fifty-seven bucks while Barnes & Noble charges forty-eight bucks.  I notified Amazon long ago about the price differential, but they didn't respond.  Shop around folks.",1344297600,11,366,4.934426229508197
5087438,3,B007I1Q4MM,"I love these episodes and just ordered them for my class. Recieved them today and discovered that besides the dialogue there is no noise. Sounds funny without the background noise (water in the rapids, opening song, etc.) Will be sending them back and hoping it is only a defect with my set!",1344297600,9,291,4.615384615384615
5087439,5,B007I1Q4MM,"Just received this today, and we are already watching DVD 1. The series comes in a case, with 8 discs. Each disc contains 7 episodes, except the last, which only has 3. The booklet gives an index of the episodes on the disc, and an area for episode descriptions. Its nice to be able to cross reference, if say, your child is learning about spiders, you can see the episode on disc 5. I love that the discs have a 'play all' option. The booklet has some coloring pages, and some suggestions for parents.",1343692800,2,502,4.351063829787234
5087440,4,B007I1Q4MM,"""Magic School Bus"" was a major part of my TV-watching experience when I was a child. So honestly, watching the series today is a trip down memory lane -- and despite some scientific changes (such as computer advances or Pluto being exiled), ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" still stands as a good, educational show for kids.

The story series around Ms. Valerie Frizzle (Lily Tomlin), an eccentric elementary-school teacher who dresses according to the episode's theme. She has a sentient lizard named Liz, and a school bus that can transform into whatever the episode requires.

She has a class of about eight students, who never seem to have math class or anything that requires them to actually stay in the building. Instead, Ms. Frizzle takes them on daily field trips, which the shape-shifting/time-traveling/shrinking bus allows them to do... in a very hands-on manner.

So the class goes on adventures in the digestive system, the bloodstream, a pickle jar, space (multiple times), the desert, a rotting log, an anthill, the Cretaceous Period, the water cycle, the bus's engine, a toy plane, Herp Haven, a beehive, an old monster movie, the Arctic, a magic pinball machine, muscles, the rainforest, a chicken egg, the swamp, the interior of a nose, electrical currents, a computer, a coral reef and so on.

And they learn about all sorts of things -- erosion, stars, cells, friction, ecosystems, microbes, recycling, tidepools, muscle oxygenation, reptiles, bats, light tricks, sound etc.  Nothing is hugely in-depth, but they give a pretty good start for kids.

""Magic School Bus"" was made in the mid-1990s, but it's actually held up quite well. Except for a few things that have changed (Pluto and home computers), most of the science stuff in this series is still pretty valid. It conveys sometimes-complex scenarios (muscle oxygenation) in a simple, easy-to-understand manner.

And they mix it up with plenty of comedy (Ms. Frizzle's entrances are always... unique) and some explicit demonstrations of just how these things work (a frictionless baseball game!). One warning for adults, though: lots of puns. LOTS of puns.

Though the kids have the appearance of having been chosen so no ethnic group would feel left out, they're each given a pretty decent characterization. One is sensible and bookish, one is strong and impulsive, one is idealistic and always talking about her ""old school,"" one is overimaginative, one is a clown, et cetera.

It's been around for almost two decades, but ""Magic School Bus: The Complete Series"" has actually aged pretty well, and is still a solid form of education/entertainment.",1337472000,108,2632,5.14519906323185
5087450,5,B007I1Q4MM,"My three year old is obsessed with this series. He almost never sees television, with the rare exception for Daniel Tiger about once a week or so. We have these DVDs and when we travel in our camper van we let him pick out an episode to watch at night. He loves it and though some of the science is a little beyond him they are entertaining. I loved this as a kid and glad to find something educational and also entertaining that he enjoys so that our limited screen time isn't mindless.",1525564800,,487,4.247311827956989

5087459,5,B007I1Q4MM,"I was hesitant to purchase these since a lot of reviewers have had problems with the discs, but I have had zero issues with my 8 dvds. The entire list of episodes is listed in the booklet that comes with the case. Each disc has the option to play all the episodes or pick which epidisode you want to watch.  I love that they have English or Spanish options as my kids are learning Spanish in school. Overall, Im super happy with this Magic School Bus set with box case. I will update if I have any issues or they stop working.

UPDATE: These do not work at all in my car DVD player. Please note that my car DVD player is total junk and rarely works, so that may have something to do with it. Again, same discs work perfectly in my home with my standard DVD player after removing from car DVD player where they didn't work (it couldn't read them). So, that may be something to consider when purchasing. Hope this helps.",1522368000,,918,4.24

5087473,5,B007I1Q4MM,"We received this box set of DVDS for our daughter for Christmas. It was ordered from Amazon by her grandparents. Each DVD is in its own hard plastic case, making them well-protected and perfect for travel. There is also a useful little workbook that comes with the set to help parents further engage their children with the material from the episodes.

My four-month-old daughter and I both enjoy this show. I am not big on ""screen time"" for kids (I think less is best), however if you have children then you understand that at times you will do anything to get a few minutes to yourself to get things done. After trying the typical baby learning shows on our video streaming subscriptions I finally landed on an episode of The Magic School Bus and it actually held her attention. She LOVES this show and recognizes the theme song as soon as it starts. She will actually sit and excitedly watch an entire episode of Ms. Frizzle and her class's adventures! I appreciate the educational element of this show and how science is broken down to where a child of *almost* any age can understand. Although my daughter is far too young to understand the concepts discussed in this show, she will have this set of DVDs growing up to learn from. The Magic School Bus is a fantastic show and this box set of DVDs is very nice and reasonably priced.",1516320000,,1337,4.547717842323651

The video and sound quality great. The DVD itself (the disc) and the sleeves are very thin and I worry we may break them easily and accidentally. So, we handle with care. I'm glad I bought this set.

I loved this show when I was a kid and the number of episodes for the price is a great buy.  It's both educational and entertaining and I feel like my kids could watch the episodes multiple times and get something new out of it each time.

I was very impressed.

5087918,5,B007I1Q4MM,"From childhood, I have LOVED The Magic School Bus TV series. Throughout the years, I'd casually look online to see if there was a complete series available. Much to my chagrin, nothing of the sort was available until a few years ago when I purchased this DVD set! I scared my younger siblings with my squeals of delight as I relived precious childhood memories with Ms. Frizzle and the gang. This series is great for younger elementary children in explaining basic scientific truths. The episodes are well done and allow for further discussion and research. The show is also enjoyable and engaging. In fact, when I was a child, I didn't realize that I was watching the dreaded ""educational television."" You can't go wrong with this show for private or scholastic viewing!",1425254400,2,771,4.848484848484849

5087923,5,B007I1Q4MM,We received these in the mail today and my son is very happy because he already had a lot of the  DVDs to begin with I think when I counted he had like 24 out of the 52 already but the whole series was $40 and I couldn't pass that up which is probably close to what I have paid already for the ones he had but were both very happy to have the whole series and he and I have the best time watching them together he's 3 and it just reminds me of my childhood watching on TV but I love that I can share this great series with him and they are so educational and not that outdated considering there from the 90's.

Although some of the science is outdated the series does a great job of getting kids excited about science and learning, while still being silly and fun enough to keep their attention.
Also, the character of Miss Frizzle is well written and acted, and makes teachers approachable and fun, which is important for younger kids to be exposed to before starting school. This show makes both of my nephews excited about school, and they're learning things. That is a major success in my book!",1421712000,2,656,4.475

5087948,5,B007I1Q4MM,"This is a great show to watch with the kids.  It's funny and smart.  Lily Tomlin is fantastic as Ms. Frizzle, the teacher who takes her class on adventures.  The series is over 20 years old, but doesn't feel too dated.  The computer episode is probably the most dated episode when they travel inside the computer and talk about floppy discs.  Other than that, the topics they take on haven't changed that much (the body, recycling, the ocean, plants, animals, science, space, etc.) It was my 3 year old's favorite show for months after the 6 year old came home from Kindergarten talking about it and I think we watched most of the episodes.  We've moved on to other shows now, but these DVDs still come out a couple of times a month.  My daughters know how soundwaves our made, why we recycle, how plants grow, how blood cells work, etc., from watching this show.  It's fun to pick out the special guest voices from 20 years ago...It was a popular show, all lot of celebrities did a guest spot.  Dolly Parton took on the recycling episode (the holiday special) and now we sing about recycling!",1420329600,2,1093,4.535714285714286

Before ordering I was concerned of some of the reviews mentioning problems with audio sound and playing some of the DVD's, but I have not had any of those problems and made sure that I played each DVD for at least one episode just to make sure.

I bought this as a Christmas present for my children and we have watched every episode at least twice. And the children are still begging for 'Miss Frizzle Movies'. It is a very fun and very understandable introduction to science. My five year old can use what she has learned from the movies to explain things around her.  All characters are very likable and allow young watchers to identify with them. My three year old insists on wearing red dresses over yellow shirts in order to impersonate my childrens' favorite character Phoebe.

The series is also not scary, which is a big plus, as my children are very sensitive to even lightly scary things. There was not a single episode that put them off.",1397260800,,842,4.526315789473684

At first I was seriously disappointed and reading the other reviews realized that this was happening with a lot of other DVD's sets as well from the manufacturer.  Before wanting a refund I tried it in an older DVD and POOF!  They all played and the menu popped up too.  So I think that it just doesn't work with newer DVD's.

These shows are so wonderful...full of fun, and humor, and knowledge. Children learn without even realizing that they are! I had 4 of the Magic School Bus dvds, which I had purchased many years ago. My own children watched them over and over, but the learning didn't stop there. We have loaned them out multiple times to other families for their children to view. Also, I worked in our local school system for 13 years, and used them at every single school I was ever posted in: elementary, middle, and high school! All kids, all ages, love these shows. Finding the complete series, all on a set of dvds, was like a dream! Very ,very happy to have them! I do not have grandchildren yet, but am hopeful that one day I will, and I know without a doubt, that I will be using these videos with them, too. We highly recommend them to any and all!

Because the dvd's come with the play all option you get to go all the way through 8 episodes before touching the dvd player or having to rewatch the same ones over and over.

5088222,5,B007I1Q4MM,A wonderful show about A class room of kids who's teacher has A magic school bus that can change them & it's self into anything.

Shortly after ordering the set and before the item was delivered, netflix had the magic school bus season 1 available.  I watched it on netflix while I waited for the item to arrive.  I was very impressed.  I started to show some episodes to my daughter on netflix and she loved them.  Then shortly after I received the item, netflix made the complete series available to view.  What I didn't like about the DVD set is that there is no option for closed caption/subtitle.  I show most of the shows to my daughter with subtitle (she is a very advanced reader) and the fact that there is no option for the subtitle is a bummer.  Netflix does have that option.  But even with this negative point, I still give the set five stars.  My daughter is learning so much.  I would recommend this set to anyone considering the purchase.  Well spent $40.

This set goes back all the way to episode one. My girls love watching together and are learning right along with Ms. Frizzle. I find myself getting sucked back in and watching right along with them.

There are significant artifacts which makes it look just plain ugly on an HDTV.  This is far below normal DVD quality.  I expected more from a reputable company like scholastic, but this is bad even for pirating standards.  I can even stream these episodes over the Internet on Netflix and that looks significantly better then these DVDs.

Two stars because my son enjoys the show, but I would have absolutely not bought this had I known the video quality was so awful.",1382745600,4,595,4.628571428571429

She will watch them start to finish (which is like 3 hours or more on each DVD, great for road trips).  I have actually learned a few things from watching these as well!  She is easily frightened but we have had almost no problems with these, except for the Haunted House episode which is a little scary.  I highly recommend them.",1381622400,,436,4.280487804878049

As homeschoolers, we are actually using this as a supplement to other ways of teaching science. Our kids are picking up a love for exploration of the great outdoors, and this series fuels that. Now our science walks are 'just like the magic school bus!'

It will teach them, entertain them, and keep them out of your hair, giving you time for housework.....or school work.

Each DVD has 5 episodes, I think, and that is a few hours of keeping their attention.  Each episode is different, so they won't get bored.

My seven year old loves watching these over and over. She recently became very interested in the debriefing scene at the end of every episode where a character explains to a caller changes/short cuts they had to make to get the episode to fit the 30 minute time slot. She has picked up even more facts here and learned that even educational programs (books) have to leave out interesting facts/information for the sake of brevity. After watching the shows, she grabs the books for additional reading.",1372550400,,658,4.730434782608696

5088349,5,B007I1Q4MM,"I cannot say enough good things about this series. My kids adore them, and my son invents Magic School Bus dramas all the time with his legos. (Lego, are you listening? We want a Ms. Frizzle set!) This DVD set is an awesome deal in terms of bang for the buck. In fact, we broke a DVD and I was even contemplating repurchasing because we are sad to miss some! The science is very well done (spoken from a PhD researcher) -- I have hardly found any flaws in any of the shows or books. At the end of each episode, they even have a ""viewer critique"" section where kids point out which parts were pretend and not accurate. And, Ms. Frizzle's basic attitude (""Take chances! Make mistakes! Get messy!"") is great scientist training. (Not ""Memorize facts!"") My 5-yr old kid can explain the basics of photosynthesis and a bunch of other concepts. Also, there are NO ADS when you start up the DVD! You can go straight to the menu, or just let it play. Final bonus -- these are helping my kids learn Spanish! We do the episode first in English, then in the next few days in Spanish. Since it is focused on science and is very conversational, the Spanish dialogue works great. Other kid shows wouldn't translate so well, esp. if they focus on reading. And if you are worried that the DVD will spoil your kid's enjoyment of the even-more-wonderful books, I can say that the show has only increased my kids' obsession with them. Final plug -- the episodes are long enough to let you get a few things done while they're watching :)",1369267200,9,1515,4.414285714285715

(sure it's ""outdated"" but still teaches a lot) My sister DVR'd all of the episodes, but I noticed they cut out the part the segment where they ""take phone calls from viewers,"" and the talk about how they had to exaggerate things for tv.

1. Menus not working
For example, you would click on ""Episodes"" and the disc would not respond.  Eventually after 30-60 seconds it did respond.  When you would click to select the episode you wanted to watch, you would again have the problem that the disc did not respond at all. This happened with a few of the discs.

2. Loud
Some of the discs ran very loudly (which does not happen with others discs in my player).

Some of the discs have menus that worked properly, and some of the discs ran normally.  However, because several of the discs had problems, I felt that the quality of the set was poor.

Overall, these are just wonderful shows but the quality on my discs was quite poor.  This made the discs difficult to use, frustrating to navigate, and not worth keeping.",1360454400,12,957,4.417142857142857

We have already watched most of the DVDs in this set and keep going. I don't really think that she is learning very much right now, she is too young for most of it but she really enjoys watching it which gives me hope that she will start learning from it later.

It does not bother me that Pluto is not considered a planet anymore but referred as such in the series. I learned that it was a planet at school and found out it is not recently. Not a big deal.

It's the first thing she asks for after school and I've noticed her pulling out more of her science-related books and playing more exploration-based pretend games than she used to. I expected she'd like it, but I didn't expect quite so much enthusiasm. For the 30 USD or so we bought this for, I'd say we got a great bargain.

Now here it is.  This is what I've been wanting.  All 52 episodes, 7 on each disk (except the last disk of course) WITH the producer speaks segments, and even with spanish dubbing if you so desire.  The boxed set also comes with a very well put together booklet that includes episode summaries for each episode, a mapping from episode name to disk number, and (most significantly) an index from topic to episode name to disk number for quick access when you want to teach your kids or students about, say, asteroids but can't remember the asteroids episode name or which disk it's on.  (It's ""Out of This World"" on disk #4...)
Scholastic definitely took chances and made mistakes, but in the end they got me what I wanted!",1359849600,,1096,4.532994923857868
5088480,5,B007I1Q4MM,My second grader loves watching these.  We pick out videos to go with her science lessons at school.  These make science fun.  We would love to see more of these made for more subjects.,1359849600,,185,4.382352941176471
5088481,5,B007I1Q4MM,This is such a great collection of ALL the Magic School Bus shows at a terrific price that you just can't beat.

I was surprised to find that these are DRM FREE!!  So you can legaly rip them to a PC (We ripped them to a media server and watch then on our Roku with the RoksBox channel)  So if you a teacher/parent out there that doesn't want to crack DRM these are  legit.",1359072000,,515,4.009803921568627

5088498,5,B007I1Q4MM,I loved this series when I was in grade school and it's been a lot of fun to share it with my kids.  It's even more fun to have my kids explain to me how recycling or hibernation works over breakfast.  No complaints here!,1359072000,,221,4.0
5088499,5,B007I1Q4MM,this is a great product and a great deal I got this during the amazon daily deals at christmas time. It was a fabulous deal and perfect for the elementary school library that I work at for the teachers to use. They are so happy with the quality.,1358899200,,245,4.125
5088500,5,B007I1Q4MM,"First of all I loved The Magic School Bus as a child, my family consisted of a lot of teachers and educational movies were a must. Watching this with my kids was great, they were so interested and wanted to watch one right after another.
 The quality of the picture is not that great but my kids didn't seem to care, so i don't find that a big issue. Overall my kids enjoyed them and that's all that matters to me!!",1358899200,,415,4.1234567901234565

5088504,5,B007I1Q4MM,"My kids got this entire set from their Aunt this year they are 3, 5 and 8. Best Aunt and gift ever!  I was curious to see if they would enjoy them, hands down they do.  This set is one of our most played sets of DVD's (it even trumps Dora and Curious George which is big in the world of the 3 and 5 year old).  As a middle science teacher I adore this show, the real terms are used in grade level appropriate ways, the cartoon nature makes topics that could be ""yucky"" or ""scary"" a bit easier for the younger age group to handle and it shows students (males and females) working as scientists.  I frequently bring this set in to lend out to elementary teachers in my school they are a great way to introduce a science unit of study.  In middle school my students will watch one of these before beginning a unit project to create their own episode of the Magic School Bus.  A lot of science based shows for kids this age water down the topics and I really feel that Magic School Bus does not.  In fact my 8 year old will frequently surprise us now with science information she has gained watching these - just the other day while talking about spiders (we are reading Charlotte's Web) she informed me that spiders use spinnerets to spin silk that they turn into webs, that some spiders even live in the ground and come out to trap their prey, and that other spiders drop down from their web to catch prey instead of using their web to trap the prey.

So the bottom line is this a great investment if you have kids interested in science, they are learning real information and the topics cover a huge amount of content.  Kids 3-13 enjoy them in my experience and they get five stars from this middle school science teacher mom.",1358726400,,1725,4.266871165644171

The topics are taught in a fun, simple way that kids will remember.  There's even a segment at the end of each episode in which ""viewers of the show"" call the ""producer"" (all animated) to ask questions about the episode.  This helps clear up confusion about which parts of the show are realistic and which parts are possible by the magic of Ms. Frizzle and the school bus.",1358208000,,518,4.637362637362638

It's fun for entire family and quite educational.  We use it for a perfect introduction to a science project or discussion.,1357603200,,271,4.723404255319149
5088606,5,B007I1Q4MM,"We've only watched 2 of the episodes so far but I grew up watching this series and loved every minute of it-it's the reason why I was so interested in science as a kid.  I purchased this set on recommendation of a friend.  We homeschool and science is EXTREMELY important to us-one of the reasons we homeschool is because we don't feel public schools really get kids interested in science and because my husband is a scientist he can see more of the ins and outs and how important it is to encourage kids to learn about science (if you're good at it you can really earn some good money too!).  This is well put together and I'm glad it has all of them.  My 4 1/2 year old (who is very smart and advanced for his age-I say this not to brag but possibly most 4 1/2 year olds wouldn't be so engrossed by this or understand it quite as well?) and 2 year old sat watching two episodes as we ate lunch today and both are just begging for more.  We are using Apologia science specifically the one about Human Anatomy and Physiology right now so I'm using it to compliment what I'm teaching him with the hands-on approach Apologia uses.  I believe in helping kids use as many of their senses as possible to learn their subjects so this is really helping explain information in a different way.

My ONLY con of this is they don't seem to be in order of when they were released nor do they have any of that information if you wanted to watch all of them in order.  As the stories don't build upon each other some may not think this is a big deal but I think it would be nice to know-it doesn't lose a star over this but something to note.  Also the quality of the picture could probably be cleaned up a little but since it's a hand drawn cartoon (at least I'm pretty sure on that since it's over 25 years old) that may not be possible.  The sound quality and everything was fine.

I recommend this to all parents-whether you homeschool or not-to help your kids learn science and get interested in it.  Watch it with them!  Ask questions!  Sure it may be cheesy to the parents but there's great information in there that you can also use to help you remember these science topics.",1357603200,,2169,4.258536585365854
5088607,5,B007I1Q4MM,Not real sure about what is under investigation regarding these videos but my son was absolutely thrilled with his this past Christmas. We had no problems at all and he has been watching them every day since he got them. My 19 yr old remembers watching them as a 3rd grader and even sat down and watched them with him!!!! Very pleased!,1357603200,,335,4.419354838709677
5088608,5,B007I1Q4MM,"We are homeschooling our almost 6 yr old who already LOVED The Magic School Bus! Amazon was running an awesome deal on it for Christmas, so we got this set for a steal!
The box set has a very nice presentation and I appreciate that there is box for all the individually packaged DVDs to fit in to so we can keep them together easier.

These are perfect for homeschooling families because each individual DVD tells you the name of the episode and the topic discussed in the episode. So if you are doing a Unit Study on the Human Body (for example) you can easily find the episodes that specifically deal the human body and let your kids watch that show during the week. Not only are the very educational and accurate, it's a really fun way to supplement your Homeschool Curriculum!",1357516800,,780,4.454545454545454

I would highly recommend it for any 6-10 year old.

5088615,4,B007I1Q4MM,"First let me say that Amazon has been wonderful dealing with issues I had with this DVD set. Also, my poor review has nothing to do with the program, but instead is with the quality of the DVDs in the Complete Series set.

I ordered this twice. The first time I received it Disc 1 skipped and was completely unplayable right out of the box. Amazon easily refunded my money and I returned it. I love the program so after several months I decided to try again and reordered. This time the discs all play but part of the sound is missing. Anytime the school bus changes or there is supposed to be some dramatic type music there is instead silence. It is extremely annoying to the point of making the DVDs very hard to watch. Buyer beware!

Update 10/7: So after 10 months my children are still watching them regardless of the missing sound. This program is so fantastic, so it really is a shame part of the sound is missing (tried in multiple dvd players), but all the vocals are there and that is the part we care about the most.",1357430400,21,1027,4.316062176165803

I received neither and this was one of the main reasons I ordered the complete set rather than individual titles. Of course, I have to go through the whole figuring out how to send it back and get it the dropoff box, etc. etc. and only four more days to order to get in time for Christmas, so this will probably not get to me in time.

Amazon makes it almost impossible to contact them other than with what options they choose. All I wanted was to have them send me the missing items, not return it all and wait for a new shipment. This SUCKS AMAZON!",1355529600,10,775,4.0

Good time if you can stand a few lines that are featured in almost every episode. (I.E. ""I should have stayed home today"" and ""According to my research...."")

These do a really good job of explaining real science concepts in ways kids can better understand them (parents too!). I would say ages 4-10ish years old children would be perfect for this show.

The complete series gives you all the episodes on 8 dvds AND it tells you the subject of each episode (""Weather,"" ""Germs,"" etc).

I owned 3 episodes from Season 2 on VHS, and they were ""The Busasaurus"", ""Taking Flight"", and ""Getting Energized"". My favorite episodes were ""Gets Lost In Space"", ""The Busasaurus"", and ""Out Of This World"". I saw ""Gets Lost In Space"" and ""Gets Eaten"" for school when I was young. I got the complete series for Christmas 2 years ago. To bad there aren't many VHS players today, but now that I have it on DVD, I can watch it whenever I want. One complaint I have with this, however is that when I watch it on my computer, there are some episodes that pause, and then stop by themselves, but I don't mind; all I have to do is pick up where the episode glitched and I have to be careful where I click in the streaming bar. Another gripe I have with the complete series is that it doesn't include closed captions, but I have to accept that. Also, what would make these DVDs even better is that if they had some bonus features on another disc. That way it would have 9 discs instead of 8. The bonus features would have included a behind the scenes feature that was featured at the end of ""The Family Holiday Special"", which I never got to watch, an interactive field trip with Ms. Frizzle and her class, science experiments with Ms. Frizzle, DVD-ROM features, trailers, and more. Above all, this is a great DVD set. If you want the entire Magic School Bus series on DVD, either for education, or for reliving your childhood, I highly recommend this.",1526256000,,1519,4.371024734982332
