5179629,3,B008RV5K5E,"Well I just finished the movie 2 minutes ago and I just got a feeling of disappointment. Yes I will still see Part 2 but only because I'm interested in how they will pull that off as well.

The biggest flaw this movie has is this. Remember in the Batman: Year One animation where they had Gordon and Bruce narrating almost everything in the movie? How you could still feel like you were reading the comic only it had voices and motion? Don't expect that from this movie. They completely took out all narration whatsoever which was the best part of TDKR. There is no ""This would be a good death... but not good enough"", no ""I'll feel better in the morning. At least I'll feel it less."" and no ""The rain on my chest is a baptism. I'm born again"". Every bit of dialogue that gave you depth for the character and the troubles he has to face are completely stripped out.

Now the voice acting was actually well (Aside from Jim Gordon having a high pitch clown voice but that's my opinion) but the delivery of some lines feel rushed and not as powerful as you thought they were in your head. This is because they hired voice actors who never really got into the comic industry and didn't really feel for the character as much as someone like Kevin Conroy or Michael Ironside would. They also skipped a lot of scenes and replaced some with ones that would work better for the animation which I don't mind since they weren't very important ones.

The animation is solid and well done. It really compliments the character design Frank Miller had created and worked very well with a lot of the fight scenes. They also got the mutants spot on both on the animation and the flawless dialogue.

Basically to sum up the movie, it showed a plot but it didn't tell a story. If you were hoping to see your characters express themselves better in animation with voices and movements that could tell the story in a way that feels real then sorry this movie isn't for you. It's just Batman talking to Gordon and beating up The Mutant Gang. Nothing more, nothing less.",1347235200,16,2047,4.4361702127659575

5179631,1,B008RV5K5E,"After my scrapbooking workshop at the community center, there  is a local flea market at an abandoned grocery store that I like to visit on Tuesdays. It's about a two and half hour ride on  the bus so it breaks it up a bit for me.
Inside the flea market there is a dealer who sells Hot Wheels, car stereos and new movies. Many of which have not come out on video or the theaters yet.
Being a Batman fan, I was looking forward to the animated version of the classic story by Frank Miller. As my luck would have it,  the dealer had the movie on DVD for sale at his table. Suffice it to say, I was all too excited.
Then, things got worse. I left my wallet back at the community center when I was in the bathroom. It must of fell off when I took off my shoes and favorite pair of corduroys.  The guy said he would be there till five so I would need to hurry.
Just missing the bus, I had to wait an hour. The bus ride was two hours long because that is the full route it takes to get back to the community center located two blocks from the flea market. Gratefully, when arrived at the center, they had my wallet and corduroys and suggested I keep them together on my person.
When I got back to the flea market, the dealer was pulling down the cage over his table, but I was able to stop him as I yelled.
Even though he said he didn't have any change, I do feel that I got a good deal on the movie.
Finally, I made it home and went straight way to the tv mounted on the cooler in the corner of the living room to watch the movie.
To be honest, I wanted to like this movie, heck, I wanted to love it. However, I can't in good conscience do or say either. In fact, I have found myself even more polarized as I write this from my Tandy desk top computer.
Most of the time, I could not hear what was being said, and the rest of the time the video quality was about as good as when I would try to watch scrambled Cinemax late at night on my grandma's tv.
They must of realized this and gave up because the movie just ends. A lot of people say this, but I remember the book being longer in content and substance that what this offered.",1347148800,19,2124,3.9672131147540983
5179632,5,B008RV5K5E,"If you think that this is someone trying to mess with you and steal the name of The Dark Knight Rises, then you should avoid this at all costs.  That is because you are an idiot and don't realize that this is based on an amazing graphic novel named ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and not some cheap rip off.  Take a minute and do some research.  They aren't trying to steal your money.  Just presenting another in what i hope is a great DC animated movie.  No where does it mention Christian Bale or any other cast members of TDKR.  please head back to your ignorant hole and stop writing ignorant reviews of products you know nothing about.",1347148800,110,636,4.3474576271186445

5179652,2,B008RV5K5E,"I am a Batman fan for my whole life.  I own the original four issue series and the compiled trade paperback.  It is one of my favorite Batman stories.  I had high hopes for this video, but was seriously disappointed.  The video should introduce a new generation of viewers to this story.  But the loss of the internal monologue and voice over commentary really hurt the presentation.  A lot of the story is lost, as is most of the meaning and understanding of the motivations.  They had a chance to make something amazing, and fell well short.",1456617600,,543,4.536082474226804

5179659,5,B008RV5K5E,"Don't bother with Batman v Superman.  Buy this.  This is the bold source material Hollywood is diluting to make a CGI-fest movie.  This is Frank Miller the writer at his best, before old age and self-absorption took hold.  We see the decay of Gotham's social fabric, rather than Batman 1996's portrayal of just excessive mugging and poor sanitation.

Though muscularly bulkier than ever, Batman's advanced age lends him a vulnerability that makes the character more relatable.  It's a foregone conclusion he will defeat street toughs and the odd villain - but how hurt will he be for the next fight?  What will it cost him?  Our superhero faces consequences that follow him from fight to fight.  No return to status quo.  This, above anything, makes DKR Pt. 1 a must see.",1451347200,,771,4.816793893129771

5179673,4,B008RV5K5E,"I watched the cartoon version of The Dark Knight Returns last night, and I was pleasantly surprised. It varied only a bit from the source material, and it was a good adaptation. The color palette was a bit brighter than I thought they would use, and I missed some of the narration that is such an important part of the book, but these are minor things. Seeing it in this medium made me realize some things about it that had never occurred to me before, and that's a bonus right there. That's cool, because I've lost count of how many times I've reread it. What I watched last night was part one of the movie, as they divided it up into two movies. Normally that ticks me off, but here I could see why they did that. I don't believe we can underestimate the effect of this book, because even after more than a quarter century it is still making ripples in the media pond that is comic books. It's inspiration could be felt in the last Christian Bale Batman movie, and it looks as if it will play out again in the forthcoming Batman v Superman movie coming out soon.",1435449600,,1064,4.298507462686567

5179726,5,B008RV5K5E,"great item but pretty hard to find in stores or even eBay. the movies is great is so is part two but the figure this exclusive set comes with makes it worth the money your gonna spend and believe me it isn't going to be cheap especially if all you really want is the figure. the figure has only three points of articulation which makes it a display piece only but a great one at that. its painted very well even for its small size which is 3.5 inches. although its small its a great piece to have because its the only figure made besides the joker figure that comes with part 2 based on this movie series. even though there are ""the dark knight returns"" figures out there they are based on the comic book that this movie has been adapted from. so that makes this figure accurate to the movie more then other figures do which make them accurate to the comic and that's why this figure is so sought after and rare. i recommend this exclusive set ONLY if you really want this figure and have the money to spare for it and or just desperate to have the figure. all in all its still a great set because you get a great movie and great figure so you'll just have to decide if its worth the money or not",1407369600,,1196,4.1373390557939915

However...having owned and read The Dark Knight Returns, I wasn't too disappointed by discovering it was an animated version of the graphic novel.  The artistry is good, the storyline follows the novel and a good time is had by all. As to characterization...the new police commissioner really raised my hackles and I wasn't too keen on Robin's character now undergoing a gender change and becoming a teenage girl but I suppose that was a bow to the feminism rising at the time the novel was written.  As for the Joker...what can one say? He's just as demented and determined and devious as ever.  On to Part 2!",1394755200,,689,4.585365853658536

5179750,5,B008RV5K5E,"This isn't your Saturday morning 'Superfriends' Batman this is The Dark Knight with all its grittiness and cut throat action. It's exactly what you'd want in an animated feature. For people that have an appreciation for this genre of film making but are afraid of the stigma of being a grown adult who likes cartoons this brings validation to those childhood whims. Where millions of dollars are spent on live action movies that still seem to miss the mark at times this feature does not disappoint with its great voice acting and writing as well as non stop action.
With a story that seems to be taken from the pages of the alternate universe of 'Watch Men' we're brought to the Reagan-esk years of the 1980's. Bruce Wayne has retired the Batman suit and is trying to fulfill the adrenaline junkie that resides in him when he discovers that Gotham is facing yet another crisis that requires his immediate attention.

I want to start off by saying that i have been a fan of Miller's work since 81 and the work that they did with the animation was great. They were very faithful to Frank Miller's drawings and his story line. The story takes place 10 years after Bruce Wayne has stopped crime fighting only to find that crime has risen and gotham city is slowly being taken over by a gang called the mutants. And wayne once again has the itch to put on the tights dispite his advanced age. It's a violent cartoon but i really enjoyed it. The only problem i have is with disc 2. It has a Bob Kane doc and 2 episodes from Bat Man's old cartoon series fron the early 90's. They could have very easily put all that on one disc.

5179773,4,B008RV5K5E,"This happens to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the acclaimed graphic novel.  There are some differences but nothing that would ruin the experience as a whole.  The fact that it has a PG-13 rating isn't much of an issue or handicap, there are only a few things that have been toned down from the graphic novel.  I'm not totally convinced that without the toned down moments that the movie would have received an R rating, but it would probably have been too close for producers, etc.

The biggest issue I have is that the graphic novel was broken up into two films, bleh.  This one covers the graphic novel up to the conclusion of the mutant gang storyline.

It does have some other issues though that should be mentioned with the voice casting and direction.

Peter Weller does an adequate job as Bruce Wayne/Batman but for some reason the almost monotone gravitas of his voice doesn't seem to matchup with the animation style on screen.  I don't blame Weller for this, that fault lies squarely at the directors doorstep.  Beyond that, and in all truthfulness, the remaining supporting voice cast is irrelevant.  I wonder if the studio could have sprung a for a few extra bucks to hire some other celebrities (at least enough for the B or C list level of celebrity).

There is also the occasional blunder, the one that stands out most glaringly in my mind is this, after Batman has come out of retirement and is chasing three crooks into an abandoned building, he turns to the two pursuing police officers and yell's ""These men are mine!"", at least in the graphic novel.  In the movie it's just a statement told with less emotion the a quarterly economic report for lower Albania.  This manages to miss the mark on two levels, failing to translate the scene adequately from the graphic novel and at the same time manages to fail as a scene from a film perspective.

The film version also removes one of the more controversial moments from the film that was in the graphic novel.  Specifically when Batman rescues the kidnapped child from the mutants he does not pursue the same resolution in the film that he does in the graphic novel (I've been purposefully vague on this point to avoid spoilers in either the film or the graphic novel) needless to say, they went the PG-13 route completely.",1388534400,,2296,4.6345679012345675
5179774,1,B008RV5K5E,"Being a long time fan of the graphic novel, I found this adaptation awful. In the original comics, the Batman is painted very darkly and whether he is hero or terrorist is difficult to decide on. As in other popular adaptations, this cartoon envisions Batman as unequivocally ""good"". The graphic novel relies on Nietzchian ubermensch philosophy when it argues for Batman as heroic. Politics, the media and the criminal Justice system fail to fight crime. Batman steps in and restores order above the mediocrity. While this cartoon did portray Frank Miller's critique of liberal media hypocrisy, it left out how ineffectual politics and Ronnie Raygun were in the graphic novel. No institution or individual was safe from the criticism of Frank Miller's pen. This cartoon was fluffed out with action scenes instead of the really disturbing, dark and cynical world of the Dark Knight where institutions have failed to create safety. That's real horror. Not generic gangs of goons being beat with ease by the Batman.",1387929600,4,1012,5.102409638554217

This movie highlights batman 10 years after giving up the cape and cowl. He is tempted to return to his old ways as crime begins to increase, and similarities to his past are seen. He eventually decides - even against his better judgement and the advice of those closest to him to return to his vigilante ways.

He returns and it is no surprise that he has lost a step or two now that he is in his 60's. That said, his brilliance as both a detective and crime fighter are his continued strengths as he finds the weaknesses of those around him and exploits them to stop Gotham's criminals.

This is an absolutely amazing series (pt 1 and 2) that show some of the darker sides of both Gotham and Batman. I would say that this is by far the most violent animated movie I have ever seen. It is pretty disturbing, and I would most definitely not recommend for very young viewers.

5179785,4,B008RV5K5E,"Frank Miller's ""Dark Knight Returns"" was one of the seminal comics of the 1980's - its gritty, violent re-interpretation of Batman as an aging vigilante brutally restoring order to a hellish urban landscape won widespread critical acclaim and, along with ""Maus"" and ""Watchmen"", cemented the idea that comic books could be authentic graphic novels with adult appeal.  The series re-popularized the character and probably helped greenlight the Tim Burton Batman films, which pretty much created the modern superhero film genre. I read the collected version back in 1990 and enjoyed it, but I never quite considered it the equal of its two aforementioned contemporaries.  This film is an animated adaptation of the first half of Miller's series.

  SPOILERS FOLLOW:

  The film takes place in an alternative 1980's some ten years after Batman's retirement from crimefighting.  A middle-aged Bruce Wayne is now drinking heavily and spending his time at racetrack driving hoping to recapture some of the old adrenaline thrill of superheroics. Many Gothamites consider the Batman to have been an urban myth, and the city is terrorized by the Mutants, a vicious juvenile gang.  The horrendous toll of violent street crime leads Wayne to once again don the mask, and his brutally effective methods inspire a young woman to become the new Robin.

  From what I remember, this is a pretty close translation of Miller's vision.  The art is modeled after the series, and the dialogue and story are basically taken straight from the original, though some of Batman's interior monologues may have been condensed a bit.  The animation quality is quite good and probably the best of any of DC's straight-to-video superhero films.  Certainly the spirit of the story is very true to Miller, with his political satire intact (liberalism is presented as academic psycho-babble and capitulation to evil; Reaganite conservatism as pandering inept jingoism) and an interestingly unlikable protagonist - this is a nasty and thoroughly violent Batman with nothing but contempt for the law. Willing to break bones, spill blood, and even use guns, this is definitely not a family friendly interpretation of the character.  As with the original, the viewer is left to decide whether this Batman is a sociopathic thug, warrior-hero, or necessary evil.

  Its certainly an intriguing spin on a character who can legitimately be called an American myth, and fans of Miller's original and those who enjoyed other animated interpretations of Batman and wouldn't mind seeing a darker version should enjoy it.  I think the film suffers a bit because the source material, while effectively dark and intelligently crafted, never really soared above pulp to become a serious exploration of its central character.  I remember reading a review describing the original as an ""R-Rated Batman"" and taken on those terms both the original and this version work pretty well, but there's a lack of depth to the characters that makes it fall short of greatness, at least to my mind.  I may be a bit spoiled by Nolan's trilogy, which proved it was possible to tell intricate, paychologically moving stories using the character. That said, things don't have to be great to be enjoyable, and if the idea of watching an iconic superhero sneer at society's sanctions sounds fun, you'll probably like this.  If not, well, you can always rewatch 2008's ""Dark Knight.""",1385251200,,3412,5.161818181818182

I put these on my wish list and received them for my birthday.  I watched parts 1 and 2 about a week apart.  I continue to be blown away.  Yes, the internal monologue / narrative that Batman/Bruce Wayne delivers is absent, but doesn't detract from the story.  You can sense and fill in the gaps along the way, not unlike the way the theatrical and directorial releases handled the same issue in 'Blade Runner'.  The voice acting is superb.  The pacing is proper and builds to the double conclusion at the ends of part 1 and part 2.  I felt at times I was watching the comic brought to life as if I was actually rereading it.  Anything can always be better, but this hits the mark better than 95% of the time.  True fans will see this for a great transfer.  New fans should see this as foundational to all that has been introduced to the Batman mythos and truly in fact all other comic mythos.  Frank Miller's work broke the mold and ceiling regarding treatment of hero/villain.  This treatment does proper justice and testament to his nearly 30 year old vision of Batman as was built from all that Bob Kane had created for his 'Dark Detective.'

So many scenes of this movie needed those thoughts. Every time a scene would come up I could hear those thoughts in my head as they appeared in the book.

5179815,4,B008RV5K5E,"This wasn't bad at all. The story was interesting seeing an older Bruce Wayne.  Being a fan of Batman, I've never really thought about him in an older state.  So this was all new and really never thought of by me so I was intrigued by the story and how they would be able to tell it and keep it real with how real Batman's character has always been (No superpowers, no flying, super strength) While some kids may want to watch this, I'd say probably teenager's would be fine, I believe there was some language and violence that I wouldn't want say my 8-10 year old nephew's watching but I'd feel safe showing them when they are older at a teen age if they are still into the comic book characters.

Like I said, it a dark story, like a lot of the graphic novels that are so popular these days with the comic's, and I look forward to watching part 2 which they sort of lead into at the end....I do have it, haven't watched it yet.  As far as the animated DC movies, this one holds up well with the other's I've seen, because it is different being the view of Batman/Bruce Wayne older so I think if you enjoy the other DC animated movies or the graphic novels and haven't seen this yet or may be hesitant, give it a shot, I think you'll like it and want to get the 2nd one to see what's next for this story.",1377216000,,1305,4.125984251968504

I have the original 4 graphic novels that goes into making the Dark Knight Returns, in addition to at last count 6 complete graphic novels ( People got them for me for xmas b-day )

I think it followed the story very well, there were some parts outta sequence with the comic, but eh..it was too bad.
One of the things that DROVE me absolutely crazy about both of these is the lack of the inner thought of the characters and the narration. I feel like there is a whole story missing.
One of the most touching parts and made me cry as a kid is when Alfred dies. 'A jolt travels the length of Alfred's SPINE. Of course, he thinks, as his head goes light' ""How utterly proper""
While some of the thought bubbles were put in here and there through conversation, like when Clark and Bruce are talking and Clark explains where the others went, were as in the comic it was when he was fighting. I still feel like a lot of the story was missing because of this.

Another thing that bothered me is when Gordon was looking for his gum, which resembled the nicorette gum, he was really looking for his cigars.

All in all its a decent watch. I have long since stopped comparing the movies to the comic, however with this I really felt they really tired to mirror the comic. For the most part they did, just a few minor things here and there, but the lack of the story with in the thought and narration is what really erked me.",1377129600,,1563,4.1827242524916945

The movies can learn something from the animated stories.  Stop re-telling the origin every time and create something edgy with the time saved.  We all know where Superman and Batman had their starts.  Show us Superman fighting Brainiac or Batman at odds with Superman.

I am a huge Batman fan and critique all Batman works with a fine tooth comb. To assure you that I do not give all things Batman the undivided thumbs up, the latest trilogy staring Christian Bale would only receive an at most 4 star rating, on a good day. Reasons being, Bale as an actor did not deliver as Batman or Bruce Wayne, and the story of final part of the trilogy was just a complete retelling of the story from the first film. In other words UNORIGINAL.

This film however, blew the Dark Knight Rises away easily with its telling of the return of Gotham's greatest hero. Any fan, even anyone remotely interested in the story of Batman, will find this story interesting.

As far as a lot of you may know, Kevin Conroy did the voice for the animated series and most of the features.  Bruce Greenwood has done Batman on as least 2 or 3 of the animated features.

5179846,5,B008RV5K5E,"This is the first of a two part animated translation of Frank Miller's classic work, The Dark Knight Returns.
For fans of the original comic, the animation adopts most of the key concepts and visual motifs. It is also quite faithful to the plot and nuances. So if you are looking for a ""faithful"" adaptation this rises to expectations.
If you are unfamiliar with that work, it can be a bit tricky. The fundamental part of the legend and myth of Batman are well known so the film makers and Frank Miller can be forgiven in not exploring the background except where it fits their fundamental themes about obsession and finding a meaning to one's life. The story of the rich young man who is scarred by crime as a child and who dedicates his life to fighting crime using his wealth and devoting his life to this end is generally well known. The book and film asks the basic question: what happens after a life time is spent fighting crime and now Batman is an old man? What has he got to show for his efforts? Is the world a better place? Has he made any difference other than to beat up a lot of thugs and crooks?

The details about particular villains, key plot themes (like the Batcave, Batmobile, Dick Grayson, and Jason Todd) and relationships (James Gordon, Selina Kyle)are assumed. If you are unclear as to who is Two-Face, Catwoman, and such, you can figure it out with careful viewing and listening to the context of the dialog but frankly that is like reading about the end of Hercules without knowing about the 12 Labors or Mysterious Island without 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and how it affected Captain Nemo. The production values are excellent with smooth animation and the action scenes are well done and faithful to the original comic. The voice acting is also excellent - not the same cast found in the superb Batman: The Animated Series but it is still very well done.

The comic and movie points out that one man, even when he is the Batman, can only do so much by himself. He must somehow change the world around him in some lasting way if he is to have any positive legacy. The obsession of Batman forces him to tie up loose ends in the present and the past. The present is manifest in the form of the Mutants, a gang based on raw power and brutality with no subtlety. The past is represented by Two-Face and the Joker. Two-Face, (once Harvey Dent, close friend of Bruce Wayne) forces Bruce to accept that there are some things his good efforts can't fix. The Joker is his classic foe - the irrational psychopath. Batman grasps and easily can deal with rational foes - their actions are predictable and motivations understandable. Counter measures can therefore be taken. The Joker doesn't fit and just wants to play and Batman is the ideal foil. The comic and movie leads us to conclude that Batman can do a lot to help stop rational crime but irrational behavior can't always be treated/cured and by definition may have no sane solution.

The world is larger than just Gotham City and when national and international politics intrude, it brings Superman into conflict. Finally Batman accepts that he has not only grown old and can't fight on as he once did, he has to engage the greater world outside of Gotham. To make his life meaningful and leave changes that are lasting he'll have to take on the world's problems. For Batman fans, it leaves the irony that he becomes very similar to his legendary enemy, Ra's al-Ghul. His intentions are clearly better and he isn't willing to see the deaths of millions to achieve his ends, but the final scene of him creating a secret organization working towards his aims and goals while keeping to the shadow and training successful generations to take on the struggle cannot be an accident. Frank Miller must have meant this as a final point and does it nicely with the subtle parallelism with Ra's al-Ghul.",1371600000,,3886,4.547142857142857

It is important to realize that this is just one part in a two part story so you don't get frustrated with ""the ending"".  Concept is great.  Animation was great for now days hand drawing and the casting of voices was also very good.

So, the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars?  The only reason I can't fully recommend it is because of violence.  The  Violence aspect IS close to the graphic novel, I guess it just went over my limit.

5179854,5,B008RV5K5E,"this movie was real!  Not nansie-pansie like Superman ""Unbound"".  Batman The Dark Knight Returns was believable beginning to end(am referring to parts 1&2)  Unfortunately I watched them in reverse order, as in my friend put them in the caracelle DVD player in the wrong order and I actually thought I was watching 1 when I was watching two.  When I watched one I quickly realized it was before the holicost and was disappointed the ending  had been spoiled for me.  Anyhow, these are great movies, if your fortunate and have the oppertunity to watch them in order.  Part One deals with the mutants and part two with the holicost. The Joker appears briefly in part two in full action, in one he's only a vegetable.  I didn't think I'd be impressed with any animated movie beyond the 1980's but I was pleased with this.  The voice actors weren't all a bunch of kids, in fact, Batman's voice was very mature and so were all the rest.  The writing and acting were mature, not like Superman Unbound which was as bad as most stuff is today.  BTDKR is extremely violent and that is the way I like it, for that is the way of the world of crime fighting and it should be depicted as such.  I loved it! Just like the graphic novel come to life!

As a visual enhancement to the story being told, I extremely enjoyed the film. As a Batman fan I very much enjoyed the film/comic and the story being told.

Batman is an old man, that part is cool, but he get's shot at CONSTANTLY and never gets hit, no stealth, just everyone misses.

5179869,5,B008RV5K5E,How anyone gives this a less than five star review blows my mind. This is the greatest Batman story ever told! It has every element that makes Batman great. So great that most of the Dark Knight trilogy was inspired by it. Some lines word for word. But this is so much more! First of all getting Petter Weller voice cast for an aging Batman was genius. Not just because the voice fits but he was Robocop and Frank Miller has close connections with Robocop having wrote Robocop 2 and 3 and writing the Robocop comic series. There's also Robocop easter eggs as well as 1989 Batman easter eggs. The music is so cool with that 80's futuristic sound. Again the music resembles the style of Robocop's. This movie has excellent rewatch value. This movie IS Batman!!!,1367712000,,759,4.547445255474453
5179870,4,B008RV5K5E,"The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and its sequel the Dark Knight Returns Part 2, are both animated movies of the DC animated line-up produced by Bruce Tim and his crew. Dark Knight Returns part one and two are based Frank Miller's famous comic of the same name. The Dark Knight Returns along with Watchmen is hailed as one of the best comics ever written. I can see why people think that way. Dark Knight Returns is not my favorite Batman but I do respect it and Watchmen. They both dealt with many heavy themes that not to many comics at the time would touch, and they were very dark as well.

This review will be on The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. The film revolves around this gang known as the mutants. This gang is wreaking havoc in Gotham, and the police are powerless. At the same time you have an aging Bruce Wayne, who has retired, observing these terrible acts of crime. Ultimately he forces himself back into the game. The story revolves around Batman and his new sidekick, Carrie Kelly a.k.a. Robin, taking back Gotham from the mutants.

I really enjoy this film. I do not like these films as much as the animated series or Nolan's Batman films, but I still highly enjoy them. Batman is awesome and more brutal than ever. Despite being old Batman kicks a lot of ass and is very brutal as well. Like Bruce Greenwood in Under the Red Hood, Peter Weller's voice took some getting used to, but it grew on me.

The character Carries Kelly surprised me a bit. I've never been that big a fan of Robin. In most incarnations I find him annoying like in Batman and Robin. However, this Robin was not annoying, and can be useful. Although she does not get a whole lot to do in this film, she does have her moments. Ariel Winter did a nice job voicing Carrie.

The rest of the voice cast did a good job as well. The art took some getting used to. It is not as appealing to the eyes as other DC animated works. At least they did not use the art from the comic. However, the art grew on me over time. The animation is very smooth which made for some good action. The action is awesome and very well animated. The score was also decent.

Overall this and Part 2 is a faithful adaptation to a great comic. Any fans of the Dark Knight returns comic should not be disappointed.",1367539200,,2268,4.302107728337236

This animated version is almost perfect, as there are scenes which match the original panels line for line.  The only reason I don't give the animated version 5 stars is because there is no interior monologue for Batman/Bruce Wayne.  This was, no doubt, a creative decision to simplify the process of bringing the story to the screen, but some of the interior monologue adds a lot of depth to the character.

The references to the last Robin and Batman's guilt around the death of Jason Todd also played well in the storyline and with a new Robin and a resurgent Joker part II of this story will be fun.

5179907,5,B008RV5K5E,"--Minor Spoilers in this Review--
It's almost a line for line adaption of the graphic novel using Miller's art as a storyboard. Fans of the original will, however, immediately notice the absence of monologue or voice over. Lines like: ""Four men die... leaving the world no poorer."" ""There are seven working defenses..."" are all missing, replaced by either dialogue spoken aloud, extra camera shots, or simple implication. For example, the camera lingers on empty drinking glasses to show a drinking problem. Sweat beads reveal fear. For me, such changes feel welcome: Show us fear, don't tell us. However, it does reduce Batman's bad ass appeal a little.

The action scenes are brutal. Miller did an excellent job but seeing a smooth flowing one on one fight in thigh deep mud (the fight moves look amazing -- reminding me of UFC but with more fast contact and less caution) is something else. I actually cringed during one brutal fight scene. When it comes to violence, the book implies a lot; the film shows everything.

Once you get into the film, you'll forget the somewhat choppy frame rate and the lack of voice over and you'll feel all the things you felt reading the book for the first time. In fact, you'll probably feel something more. There were frames in the book that I didn't fully understand (how did they get into that position? How did Robin get Batman into the Bat Mobile?) that the film explains better. And certain bits of emotion, especially around Carrie Kelly, feel more emotional in the film than they did in the book.

Oh and the commissioner doesn't smoke... he chews nicotine gum. What a cop out!",1364083200,,1623,4.7686832740213525
5179908,5,B008RV5K5E,"This was an amazing adaptation of the Frank Miller classic.  It is a truly rare occurrence when a comic adaptation is kept true to its source and this one is about as faithful as it can get.  I was iffy when I heard Petter Weller was going to be voicing Batman but to my surprise, he pulls off the older weary Batman perfectly.  I have seen some people complain about the art in some of the reviews here.  The art is actually a faithful reproduction of the stylized art of the original pencil artist for the comic books.  As for those people that gave it one star complaining the they were mislead by the title, sorry but thats the original title of the 25 year old comic.  They did not name it that way to trick you into buying it.  The first sentence of the product description states that it is animated and the box art is a comic book drawing.  In my opinion a great story that will not leave you disappointed even if the purchase price is a little steep considering you have to buy part one and part two.

I enjoy seeing Batman fighting the baddies, like the Joker or Penguin.  And I see the character change with new actors playing the part of Batman in each movie. The story is different in this movie since it has mutant leader, a different look of two face and many others.  I guess we all get older and want to enjoy the things we like in life. Batman is still the one as well as Superman as the most love heroes. It is nice to remember when you was young and enjoy watching Batman on TV the animated version of the 1990s or the 70s (Dare to remember that)!!!

This one is not necessarily for children, this is from the same Writer who make the graphic novel Watchmen, so think adult themes.  It's years after the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd and Bruce Wayne is a retired Batman looking for thrills.  This is combined with society that has just gone completely down hill, a new gang, the Mutants, have appeared and are conducting acts of random violence beyond anything Gotham has seen in years, finally Wayne's sub-conscious wins out and Batman takes back to the streets to restart his campaign against the lowlifes of Gotham City.  This, along with part 2, is extraordinary animation quality, amazingly in sync with the original works, some parts even looking like exact panels taken straight from the graphic novel.  If you know Batman, you know this story (even if you've not read the book) because this story was the backbone of the modern Batman that we all came to know through the 1980s and into the 90s and to the present day, even in the ""New 52.""

Kevin Conroy & Mark Hamil do not reprise their classic roles & though when I read comics I hear their voices in my head, Peter Weller & Michael Emerson fit the bill in this MASTERPIECE perfectly. I could go on & on, but the main focal point I want to impress upon you is, this should not have been a DVD release, THIS NEEDS TO BE SEEN UP ON THE BIG SCREEN.

This is one of the best DCAU movies. I haven't watched Part 2 yet though.

I remember when they did an episode of Batman:TAS that had a small part of this story in it. (Legends of the Dark Knight I think) This is that part on steriods, same visual style, the same pointy nipples on the mutant boss but with more brutality. Incredible. Dark. Intense.

I want to address the one glaring flaw:  we don't get the inner monologues that made the graphic novel so engaging.  The internal thoughts of Bruce/Batman not only showed the struggles of the aging batman, but they help to push forward important themes about vigilantism, justice and crime.  The voice acting is, overall, superb.  I can't understand why the creators didn't include the inner narration that was so important to the original.",1362441600,2,650,4.863636363636363

So much in this adaptation is just spot on. (Thank you DC)  It's not only faithful to Frank Miller's graphic novel, it also adds to it by fleshing out some moments that were shorter in print and refining the look of the characters and Gotham.

I watched it three times during my instant video rental, and it holds up extremely well.  If you like this story, you MUST see this because it adds to the legacy of this amazing Batman story.

5179931,4,B008RV5K5E,"I understand that they needed a longer running time to go into detail with this story, but did they really have to separate the parts into separate products?  I feel like these movies were rushed and meant to serve as cash cows.  That said, if you have the funds to watch both parts, you should enjoy them.  Part 1 was very gritty and somewhat similar in its premise to the Dark Knight Rises film released around the same time, but in my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is better in every way.

[ALERT:  Potential spoilers below!]

Basically, Bruce Wayne has retired from being Batman, and it has been ten years since the Batman was last seen.  The Justice League was disbanded a long time ago, around the time Batman retired.  The city of Gotham is just as terrible as ever due to a gang calling themselves The Mutants.  Harvey Dent (2-Face) is let out of a mental hospital only to go missing.  The Joker is seemingly brain-dead, not eating on his own, not talking, not laughing, sitting in the same mental hospital Harvey left.  The Batman returns to find Harvey and save him from his old ways.  The Mutants also get a wake-up call.

In my opinion, Dark Knight Returns is much like Batman Beyond, except without all the futuristic gadgets and a new Batman suit.  It is also a lot more gritty than Batman Beyond.  In many ways, Dark Knight Returns is better for being more believable than the films.  Batman doesn't run around with tons of high-tech vehicles, and his suit does not protect him at all.  He doesn't come off as a millionaire.  He uses his wits and combat training to defeat all his villains.  That said, he has a tank, a motorcycle, a glider, smoke pellets, his classic grappling hook, and a few other devices.  He just does not come off as rich as he does in the live action films, because he uses technology sparingly.

Overall, part 1 is great and very enjoyable.  However, you will want to see part 2 right after it.  Replay value is somewhat high, because it is always fun to see society's reaction to the Batman making his initial appearance.  It is also fun to see the female Robin make her appearance in animated form.  Part 2 has the Superman scenes, which are much more fun to watch, but the story of part 1 is top notch.",1362355200,,2244,4.467980295566503

If you have read it, flip through again right before you see this.  They even added more to the Superman/Batman smackdown to make it more realistic (that's part II, but still) than was contained in the graphic novel.  The rest was very true to the graphic novel, they went out of their way to not alienate the fans of the original piece of work and to make it all make more sense in the movie (see extras in part II).  There were extra fight scenes at the end of part II that helped the Superman/Batman conflict make more sense from a mortal Batman standpoint (i.e. the construction site scene with the I-beams).

District Attorney Harvey Dent who was formerly Two-Face was fixed as he got released and Commissioner Gordon (David Shelby) turned 70 as he has one last week before retiring from the police force and Bruce is in his mid-50s as he's still built like a lion, but there's one problem in the form of a gang called The Mutants who are causing serious trouble for the city as they have done the worst crimes that happened in the city since The Joker. This boils Bruce's blood even with memories that trigger this as he decides to go back in style as his alter-ego known only as Batman as he is kicking all kinds of major Mutant butt around the city, this impresses a 14 year old girl named Carrie (Ariel Winter) who decides it's time for her to become his new Robin for he must try to take on the leader of the mutants with all the help he needs.

A quite faithful to the first 2 issues adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking comic book mini-series and perhaps it with part 2 are the best animated Batman movies along with Under the Red Hood, Mask of the Phantasm, Return of the Joker and Sub-Zero. Very well made and animated effort that captures the spirit of Miller's classic story with great voice acting mainly by Weller whom Batman fans know as one of the original choices for Batman back in the late 80s as he finally gets the chance to play the character he always wanted to play. It leaves you wanting for more which gets even better with part 2.

5179966,4,B008RV5K5E,"pros: -Voice acting is good this batman sounds like a weathered old war veteran which in a sense is all too true a
  -animation is a unique smooth style that looks good
  -action sequences blend realistic/gritty urban terrorist situations with DC/comic book action to bring a unique spin on the usually predictable superhero genre
  -pacing is good enough so that you crave watching part II ASAP!

cons: news commentary seem very lifeless and drawn out
  some plot threads seem introduced then cast off in seconds
  some inner monologue missing from batman as we'd like to see what he thinks from time to time of whats going on around him

All in all i'd say an 8.5/10 very well done and action packed for 1/2 a movie",1360886400,,717,4.603174603174603

5179968,5,B008RV5K5E,"This animated feature of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is great and turned out better than I expected. In many scenes, in my opinion, enhances upon the original graphic novel and I would say even better than the source material. The lines and colors are much smoother and richer here, and Miller's story plays out nicely, proving the book was written with a cinematic scope in mind. Again, some scenes in this movie look better than how they were laid out in the book.

I was routing for Bruce Wayne and Batman and reminded me much of how bada$$ Batman was in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.

The extras include a great documentary about Batman creator Bob Kane, a featurette about girl robin Carrie Kelly, two episodes from the Batman animated series and more. Only thing I felt was missing from the extras is an interview with Frank Miller himself, but maybe he's in the extras for Part 2, I hope.

I read this graphic novel years ago, and Warren Ellis's version of an older, over-the-hill Batman was intriguing, and really stamped the 'dark' in Dark Knight. DC did a solid job here at re-creating the graphic novel, and not making it childish or stupid, but darker and grittier for adults, as well as keeping it like Ellis wrote it.

5179974,3,B008RV5K5E,"The Dark Knight Returns is one of my all-time favorite comic stories, and I was hoping that the film would match its greatness. But as other reviewers have pointed out, much of what made the story great has been eliminated and background noise as been moved to the forefront.

The TV news broadcasts, which have a place in the comic and do add depth to the story are overemphasized and slow the pace too much.

All of Batman's inner dialogue, his reasoning for what he does (and doesn't do) are eliminated completely. When I first watched it, i thought I had a sound problem and that the channel carrying that dialogue had failed. After fiddling with the audio for a bit I had to accept that some of the best lines in the comic were just left out of the film.

""This would be a good death... But not good enough.""
""There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact. Three of them kill. The other--hurts.""
""It was tough work, carrying 220 pounds of sociopath to the top of Gotham Towers -- the highest spot in the city. The scream alone is worth it.""

These lines give us insight into the mind of Batman. Without them, the film is really pretty dull. Like a tracing of the Mona Lisa passed off as the real thing.",1360368000,3,1256,4.424242424242424

5179978,5,B008RV5K5E,"Take the idea of Frank Miller's classic. Hand it over to Warner Brothers and their superior story boarders, artists, animators and voice artists. And sit back and be amazed!

Miller's concept and story is all there. Faithfully adhered to. With some of the rougher edges smoothed over, but not too much.

Keep the cramped and crowded feel of Gotham intact, but stylize it a bit. Put deep, dark 'Gotham Noir' shadows wherever there is no light. Put that in the hands of Andrea Romano and her innate skill at finding the right voices. And you have the makings of a classic at your fingertips!

Peter Weller's voice of Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight fits. Aged and mellowed a bit, but only on the outside. As does David Selby as Commissioner Gordon and Michael McKean as the obnoxiously arrogant Dr. Wolper. The rest of the cast meshes well, but it's the visuals and artwork that sets the tone and plants that flag deeply.

All of Miller's iconic ""money shots"" are well rendered. But its the artists' work with shadow and the Dark Knight's reaching out from them to render justice that takes things up a notch. The Dark Knight may not be as quick as he once was, but reestablishing a legend takes time. That, and an all too squishy media is more than ready to pick up on.

If you are a fan and something of a purist of the original Warner Brothers series. You'll find that things haven't changed all that much in Gotham. It's more crowded, dirtier, more run down and scarier. Thanks to Jay Oliva's meticulous direction. If you're a fan of Frank Miller epic.

5179989,5,B008RV5K5E,"This movie is based off the Frank Miller novel of the same name, where Batman comes out of a long ten year retirement only to return into a Gotham City over ridden by a madness with a bloodthirsty gang known as The Mutants. However, the world is more cynical and cut-throat than most DC Comic Book stories. Half the people are glad that there is once again a Dark Knight lurking in the shadows to strike fear into the hearts of criminals, while the other half consider him as a fascist that is a criminal of not just breaking 'n' entering and batter, but also the civil rights of the very criminals he hunts. He must also fight an even more deranged and even suicidal Two-Face that has now started scratching both sides of his infamous coins, and he must also fight the Mutant leader, a strong brute monster of a man with razor sharp teeth in the prime of his youth, while the Dark Knight is now probably in his late 50's or early 60's.

There is a lot going on in this movie, but it is all perfectly pace; not too fast or not too slow. I think that is why they broke it down into two parts so that they can avoid repeating the mistake of ""Superman: All-Star"". The adventure and story is gritty, gothic, and dark, everything you'd expect from a story about the Cape Crusader. So if you're looking for a DC Comic Book animated movie that is not at all targeted to kids, this is for you! The animation is flawless and spectacular, and with the high-definition of blu-ray it looks incredible, even if it is indeed animation. Even though there aren't any big names that I recognize in this, all the voice acting is fantastic nonetheless. And throughout the movie there are little Easter Eggs throughout the movie that you may only recognize if you're an avid DC Comic reader.

Needless to say, I think this is Warner Bros. DC Animation's finest work that can only be topped by Part Two that about immediately follows the timeline of this movie. I definitely recommend buying this movie! I can't help but watch it over and over again, it's that good, and that hardly ever happens with me! So stop reading these reviews and BUY IT NOW!

Peter Weller was the perfect choice for the main role.

This movie, for the most part, delivers. The animation is awesome, the voice talents do the trick, and I like how they throw in the random news reports alongside the action. Very Watchmen-esque.

One thing that was missing was a lot of the dialogue. Batman only says a fraction of the dialogue in the movie that was in the comic; hardly any thought-dialogue, and not much more out loud. To be fair, what dialogue there was is spot-on, and maybe too much dialogue would've made the movie exposition-heavy. Still, it would've been nice to hear more of the famous dialogue come to life.

I give it a four out of five. Definitely get it.",1359590400,,903,4.363095238095238

If you read the graphic novel in 1986 (I think), you know the story. If you love the graphic novel, you'll love this movie. It is animated, but it's not a cartoon. Don't let your 5 year old watch it. This isn't the 1960's Adam West Batman. It isn't a funny movie.

But if you didn't like the graphic novel, don't watch this, because it's about as faithful as you can get without some of the inner dialog Batman has in the book.

Maybe some new blood in your creative department, don't get me wrong, I love everything that has been done, you don't think that batman would be good enough?

I'm mainly writing this review in order to regain some of the product's footing after a slew of one star reviews given by people who seem to have somehow confused this film with Christopher Nolan's, ""THE DARK KNIGHT RISES."" It just so happens that this movie is fantastic in its own right and deserves the accolades given by the more knowledgeable viewers.

Many of the negative reviews I've read have mentioned that they were ""duped"" or ""ripped off"" by Amazon for releasing this stellar animated feature from Warner Brothers. Ok, I understand that they have the same distributor and you might not be the biggest fan of Gotham's most famous vigilante, but surely you would have read the product description, yeah? I mean unless you've been living under a rock the size of Uluru, you would've at least glanced the box art and realised that that was indeed not Christian Bale on the cover juxtaposed with an incendiary bat symbol from one of the most ubiquitous movie posters of the last decade. You of course noticed that Peter Weller was not the actor you expected to see fighting Bane (who's not credited on this blu ray) alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and that you'd never heard of a director named Jay Oliva. Right?

However, if you used your super sleuthing skills to come to the conclusion that a film titled ""THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS"" is just that and no more, then you're in for a treat. The movie itself is a great adaptation of a very special graphic novel by the talented Frank Miller. It holds true to the theme of the original 80s manuscript and lends itself to cinematic interpretation. Unlike a lot of ""graphic novels"" that are actually collections of a comic book's natural and lengthy story cycle, Miller's story was originally intended to be a singular story with a strong and narrow focus. This helps avoid the pitfalls that other comic-based stories tend to have, where it's just one guest appearance/mindless action romp/plot jump after another. This picture is a honed and self-motivating piece that attempts to explain how Bruce Wayne is more Batman than Bruce Wayne. It's a great theme to run with and I think it pulls it off. I might have liked to see at least a hint of Batman's internal monologue as it was portrayed in the book, but I'm aware that film is a different animal to literature and some hard decisions had to be made.

If you are a person who has dabbled in Warner Brother's other DC universe animated outings, then I would put this above the much-loved BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD (which I too enjoyed, if that gives you any reference) and even BATMAN: YEAR ONE (another Miller-penned gem).

If you came to see THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I think you'll be delighted with the quality of animation and respect that this release has given to its source material. If you're here to see THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, you might want to learn how to read.",1357862400,,2900,4.67843137254902

5180030,5,B008RV5K5E,"This obviously was an animated flm. Those who are confused by the title and mistakingly thought this was the Christian Bale flick are complete idiots if they can't take this wonderful tool known as the internet to realize what exactly they're order. Giving this product 1 star because you're too lazy to take 5 minutes to do some research is ridiculous. It's people like you putting this country into the toilet.

MOVIE: I wasn't sure how whether I would like it or not. I've loved WONDER WOMAN, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD and JUSTICE LEAGUE: CRISIS ON TWO EARTHS but wasn't a huge fan of their other productions. After watching this film, I felt satisfied and eager for part 2. Loved Peter Weller as Batman and the music was friggin' good. It reminded me of music that you'd hear in revenge flicks fromm the 70s & 80s.

Although this film follows the graphic novel, the director was smart enough not to be beholden to it. He carefully establishes some small scenes that help bridge viewers into this world where the city's at it's most dangerous while an increasingly elderly Bruce Wayne looks on wondering if he still has what it takes. Can he help this city again -- find it's strength in the pit of misery it currently finds itself in?

5180034,5,B008RV5K5E,"The newest animated feature from DC Entertainment is one of its most anticipated releases, and for good reason. It was The Dark Knight Returns that turned the comic world on its head in the 80s. The stark reality, the darkness, even for the Dark Knight, was darker than ever. Batman vs the Mutants. Batman vs The Joker. Batman vs Superman. The storyline is epic, but how did the first part of this animated retelling do: did it do the cowl justice?

Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is considered one of the greatest comics of all time, and I agree completely. So, I was overjoyed and a little worried when I heard that it was becoming a two part animated feature. What would they change? What would they ""dumb down""? Would it still feel like The Dark Knight Returns? The answer, I am happy to report, is yes. Part 1 has the look and feel of Frank Miller's classic, and fans really can't ask for more.

The story takes place in a world where Batman has been retired for 10 years...and before people moan about ""it's ripping off Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Rises"", remember that this came out in the 80s as a comic, back before Joseph Gordon-Levitt was even seeing Angels in the Outfield. Bruce is a shell of a man: cold, out of place, and seeking an end. That all changes when he realizes the rise of the deadly mutants in Gotham, which makes him realize that The Batman is needed. Peter Weller, best known for his starring role in Robocop 1 and 2, voices the aging dark knight, and he does a superb job of doing so. All the voice talents really step it up a notch and create something special, something masterful.

Now, what about the violence? Was it toned down? Not by much, thankfully. We still see what happens during a meeting with the Mayor and the Mutant Leader, we see the knock down, drag out fight between Bruce and the Mutant Leader, and we see the new, female Robin, who is this time the young Carrie Kelly. All the parts that made the book for me are present here: the newscasters, the odd speaking mutant gang, the massive and intimidating Bruce Wayne and his ""Batmobile"". For me, this is the best animated film DC has made to date, and that's saying something. I cannot wait for part two, to see The Joker, Clark Kent, Green Arrow, and the Anti-Superman Armor Batman.

Gotham City has changed in the ten years since he ceased his double life, becoming a haven for even more ruthless gangs than before, and Batman himself has become withdrawn and isolated. As in the original source material, I can see why it's so acclaimed, though it's not to my personal taste. The animation style is a mix of the look from the animated series with influences from the graphic novel. Miller's influence is clear throughout, with his personal misogynistic, pessimistic, and even nihilistic world view pretty much playing itself out.

Even though this is Batman, this isn't necessarily something that is great for kids. It's a pretty dark story and some kids may be turned off by it. The story itself is great though. It has great voice acting and tells a great story of Batman/Bruce Wayne in his older years. This also finally introduces the first female Robin which my niece loved because she really got behind her. If it's a bit more of a mature slant on Batman that you're looking for then you should be happy with this. It ends on a great point, setting up for what should be an interesting start to part 2.

When Frank Millers Dark Knight Returns came out it brought me back into the Comic Book stores, where I found other titles such as Animal Man and Sandman.  This is a worthy adaptation of Frank Millers classic graphic novel, even if its not a panel by panel replica, and I cant wait for Part 2.
Peter Weller (of Buckaroo Banzai fame) provides an excellent Batman voice, perhaps the best ever. I also enjoyed the digital version of the original comic included here as an extra feature, which lets you move panel by panel after showing the whole page and looks good on the screen unfortunately it won't remember where you stopped, so youll have to go the beginning each time.

I am happy to report I have been proven wrong; this is an excellent film that remains very faithful to Miller's bleak vision of the Darknight Detective. It's also one that, unlike a lot of similiar projects, actually justifies its own existence, at least in my opinion. How is that, you ask? Well, when I read the original graphic novel in the 80s, I recall thinking, ""This is superhero film noir."" Now that it's a movie, it actually IS a film noir (okay, technically it's a neo-noir, but you know what I mean), and quite a good one to boot; I think that's pretty neat.

A couple of minor critiques: First, the filmmakers decided to eliminated almost all of the narration from the original comic here. Normally, this would be a valid aesthetic decision; however, I feel that it works against the film here, as it deprives the work of one of its most explictly noirish elements and most (although not all) of its best lines. Secondly, although this film , unlike many of the other DC Universe Animated Movies, is quite easily understandable to the non-fanboy viewer, there is some discussion in the film of Jason Todd (aka the second Robin) that may be  confusing to the neophyte. Fortunately, this is quite easily rectified by a quick perusal of the graphic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-A-Death-in-the-Family/dp/1401232744/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: A Death in the Family</a>, to which I commend you.

5180063,4,B008RV5K5E,"I know that the Frank Miller Graphic Novel didn't do as well as people might have liked, but it does have a strong following. And as evidenced by other fans of the original work this film was a strong adaptation of it.

One thing that it misses is the internal monologue that usually follows a Batman Graphic Novel or the comics, but to say that being missing is a deal killer is rather strange. No other Batman video offering that I have seen gives you that internal monologue. That includes the Nolen films, the Animated Series, the Animated Series movies, and the various shows and films that he was a character in.

So saying that this being missing kills the movie is strange since it's rare to see it outside of print. It's like complaining that this grapefruit tree sucks because it doesn't grow oranges when no other grapefruit tree has ever grown an orange.

But back to the movie itself. While it's strange to hear a Batman voiced by someone other than Kevin Conroy, Peter Weller still does a wonderful job of being the gritty voice behind the mask. You really can believe that this is Bruce Wayne many years along from the days of his prime.

The film moves along with the same speed as the Graphic Novel and doesn't bore us with any slow points. It takes a little while to build up but once it gets its head of steam, it doesn't stop.

I honestly can hardly wait for the second part to come out and I hope that they're planning to do the sequel work of Miller ""The Dark Knight Returns Again""",1355788800,2,1503,4.411552346570397

So the visual grittiness and darkness is lacking a little. So they lengthened it into two volumes instead of one. So Peter Weller isn't the right voice.

Regardless...I was skeptical based on the reviews on here but when I continued watching I couldn't help but be pulled in to the story and actually be riveted by it. It's not as earth-moving or seminal as the graphic novel but the source material was written twenty plus years ago and rewrote and repainted the Batman mystique. We've had the 1989 Batman and the Nan trilogy so it's unfair to expect similar impact from this medium. But it's still a decently enjoyable animated film.

That must have been how the first production meeting went for project. I read the original when It came out and I was just out of high school, have always wanted a good animated version, and I'm still waiting. The animation isn't that great, it pays homage to Miller's style but so did an old episode of ""Batman the animated series"", which I felt captured this better. Nor was I impressed by any voices but Gordon's, just not good matches. But the worst affront to the original, is the complete abandonment of Miller's storytelling style. Miller's character's are defined by having internal monologues that speak volumes, to even attempt to translate the book to a movie without that mechanism seems ridiculous. That same internal monologue carried the movies ""300"" and ""Sin City"" so well, that to turn your back on it when making the Dark Knight returns, I feel we are all owed an explanation by the director as to why he would do so. So that's it, they adapted the ""Dark Knight Returns"" without ""I think of Sara, and the rest is easy"", ""leaving the world no poorer, 4 men die"" or the often repeated ""This would be a good death......but not good enough"". One of the many things that made the original so good was Miller's writing, and here they've thrown over half of it out. So sadly the whole thing feels holy and not very Milleresque, besides the internal monologue lots of even spoken lines are left out, for no real reason. So it took them nearly 25 years to adapt ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and they only used a 3rd of it, go figure.",1354406400,5,1736,4.528662420382165

Frank Miller reinvented the Batman with Year One.  Without Frank Miller there would not have been the Christopher Nolan films or Sin City.  Frank Miller is the creator of The Dark Knight.  This is by far one of the greatest comics ever written and a wonderful adaptation.  I highly recommend this for anyone who reads comics and understands the underlying social commentary that is going on throughout.  Read the comic and the sequel The Dark Knight Strikes Again.  This movie embraces the human spirit, the ability in all of us to stand up and fight back.  The reason Batman and Robin are so compelling is because they are not super, they are people, people who have had enough.  This movie brought tears to my eyes.  The people who don't like this are the same people that didn't understand The Sandman.  They are only looking for blockbuster Hollywood stuff, not actual storytelling.  Not that I think Christopher Nolan's new vision of Batman is poor, it's probably the best live action Batman around.  DO NOT BE MISLED BY POOR REVIEWS!!!!!",1354147200,2,1176,4.705882352941177

It is simultaneously a very faithful adaptation of the source material and yet grounded in a modern-day realism (astute observers will recall that the graphic novel was, shall we say, garishly 80's at times).  To be honest, I can't really tell how they pulled that off or what makes me think so.  The animation and voice acting are both superb.

Whereas some of the older DC animated movies (i.e. 'First Flight', 'Wonder Woman') felt kind of like long-form entries in the Timmverse (which isn't remotely a bad thing), this truly feels like a distinct, masterful work of art.

I can't wait to sit down one Saturday and watch 'Year One', 'Under the Red Hood', 'Dark Knight Returns, Part 1' and 'Dark Knight Returns, Part 2' in one long, glorious, Batman-filled afternoon.",1353974400,,806,4.854014598540146

If you order something without reading the title or description then any mistakes are your own fault.

As for an actual review I should preface it by saying The Dark Knight Rises is one of my favorite comics of all time. I was hesitant that it wouldn't be a faithful adaption but it really does do a tremendous job. It captures the tone and feel of the comics exactly.

I don't know if this was intentional, but they did a great job of even showing how the Dark Knight Rises adapted scenes from the book. The movie doesn't follow the book exactly, but that is mostly so that they could turn this into a two-part movie. For those who may be skeptical by that last sentence, don't be. They do a fantastic job at creating a very self-contained story and then create a little cliffhanger to set up the second part.

I found this first part to have a decent balance of ""talking"" scenes as well as action scenes that were in the story to serve a purpose.

If you wanted ""The Dark Knight RISES"", as in the last of Nolan's live-action Batman movies, that doesn't come out until December 4th or so.

This is NOT bait-and-switch. Anyone who knows the first thing about Batman knows this is based on the famous graphic novel. If you don't know that, the least you could do is read. Was Peter Weller Batman in the live action movie? No? Then maybe you're thinking of another movie, no?

This depiction of Batman's universe took my senses back to the grit of the 1980's: a time when street punks still lurked, the best video games cost a quarter to play, and most cities had yet to receive the cleansing effect of modern urban renewal efforts.

The Batman we are presented with here is a veteran from a lifetime of war, struggling to decide whether or not to don the cape for one more battle. Whether or not this story is still relevant after more than 25 years is up to the viewer. From my perspective, its themes are as powerful today as they were in 1986.

This film succeeds in delivering the essence of the original graphic novel in striking detail. The adaption of the story from pane to frame is seamless.  However, viewers may be disappointed that they will have to wait for the release of the conclusion.",1353283200,,895,4.512345679012346

5180134,4,B008RV5K5E,"Mostly it's a very good adaptation of the graphic novel.

I have several problems, and I won't consider them killers but have to note here;

The acting is sometimes not as passionate as I'd like.  The dialogue is brushed over, especially the word ""Rape""

""Assault and mutilation of...""
""Only when they die by our hands... "" but no ""See their women Raped...""
No ""And I will then take the city's new cop, it's WOMAN cop and I shall"" - ""The rest of the Mutant leader's speech was deemed unfit for broadcast""

Now I won't say don't rent the movie, or to boycott it as some nerdy fanboy who's murdered they murdered his favorite childhood memory...
Just overall the adaptation is good but not perfect...

I think they should have:

1.  Made it dark and gritty.  There's an episode in the animated series ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" where they did this effect perfectly and that was with I'd bet 1/10 the budget and no computer animation to help with the hard work.
2.  No apologies, let it be R rated have Miller's full dialogue...
3.  Anachron...what...?  Who cares, let it be Miller's original work of the Batman of the 50s to the 70s coming out of retirement in the 80s with Ray-Gun as prez and the world on the brink of nuclear war and Russians the big baddies in the background.  (the second or third Batman, the original universe started as an adult in the 30s)

I think DC made some trade offs for a PG-13 rating and to skip over a dated work.  I'm still for watching it, buying it for most enthusiasts.  Good animation and very entertaining.
Some rabid purists might feel betrayed.  Not sure about that, like I would be over the new ""Conan"" that's a pointless re-make of the first movie.

5180180,4,B008RV5K5E,"Overall good treatment of Frank Miller's version of a middle-aged Batman, returning to the battle for Gotham.

For those who were not around at the time, this was the seminal re-imaging of Batman, from his various incarnations as campy crimefighter, popular hero and so forth; this Graphic Novel brought Batman back to his roots. No witty one liners, no bat-devices to conveniently tie up or immobilize opponents. No, here is a brutal vigilante, loved by some, hated by others, feared by most, who enjoys a tenuous relationship with the law, based on his friendship with the current commissioner, who is soon to retire.

All told, I thought the movie did a pretty good job of making the jump from Graphic Novel to Animated Feature.

I found the movie to be on par with Batman: TAS, as far as animation quality. Peter Weller is good as Batman/Wayne, so no loss on that front.

My one point down is only because a) I really like the voice over which was provided in the Graphic Novel, and do miss that aspect, and b) I wish they could've done a longer movie, and managed the entire Graphic Novel.

Still, all in all a good treatment. I will most definitely rent the second movie to see how they handle the conclusion.",1351641600,2,1215,4.606481481481482

5180194,4,B008RV5K5E,"If you are a Batman comic book fan, there is a good chance you read Frank Millers ""The Dark Knight Returns"", as it was a groundbreaking story of it's time. Bruce Timm (the creator of Batman: The Animated series) drew great inspirtation from this graphic novel, so it seemed obvious that he would adapt this story at some point. And now we finally have Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. So, being a huge fan of this story, did years of waiting for an adaptation pay off?

Fortunately, the answer is yes! Although I liked it, my problem with the Batman: Year 1 film was the information being cramed into 1 film. But, making Dark Knight Returns 2 parts was a smart move. Every inch of the graphic novels first half is explored in this film, and I couldn't have asked for more.

So, the story of Dark Knight Returns is identical to the comic. If you are NOT familiar with the comic, this is the synopsis: Batman retired after the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and 10 years later, Gotham is worse than ever. A new gang (called the Mutants) is almost in total control of Gotham, and the City is just as bad as it was in Bruce Waynes early years. After the dissaperance of a reabilitated Harvey Dent, the time has come, and Bruce Wayne must become Batman again, and take the mutants down, along with the aid of a new Robin. However, the reaperance of Batman will come at a price, as his return will awaken old enemies (who we will see in Part 2).

THE POSITIVES:
-The animation is solid. Although the style isn't quite the same as the comic, the character designs are still almost identical to the source material. I was pleased with most of the animation.

-The action was fantastic. Every peice of action from the comic is put on film, and then expanded upon.

-The voice actors all do a good job. No one here is bad at all. Peter Weller isn't spectacular, but is still a good Batman.

-Alot of credit here should be given to Jay Olivia, the director. What can I say, he is extremely faithful to the source material, and his editing and directing are brilliant. They picked the perfect scene for the ending, which is a great cliffhanger that got me VERY excited for Part 2.

-The pacing is great. It's easy to follow along, I never got bored, and I didn't want it to end when it did.

THE NEGATIVES:
-Like I said, Peter Weller is a good Batman, and everyone else does a good job. However, lets not forget that they are all newcomers, and there are some lines of dialogue that seem, ackward, and other scenes where it sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time. But, there is room for improvement, so im glad they didn't do Part 1 and 2 at the same time.

-Although the animation is great for most of the film, the opening seems bland. If you havn't seen the other DC animated films, you won't notice. But, if you have, then you probably know that they do a great job with their detail, and how they take their time with some scenes. However, with this film, some scenes just seem really bland, namely the opening. The animation improved over the course of the film, but the begining just didn't seem, finished. It was still great overall, but not in line with some of their other films at times. But again, there is room to improve in Part 2.

-The only character who seemed to lack development is the new Robin, Carrie Kelley (yes, Robin IS a girl in this story, but a completely different character). But, I won't complain that much simply becaude she has just as much development as the comic. That was my only complaint about the comic, though. If there is one thing that I felt they could have expanded from comic to film, it would be her backstory.

My complaints with the film are really just nitpicks though, I just had to list my problems (as few as they were). Overall, the Dark Knight Returns Part 1 is how you make a good, faithful adaptation. The only reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I need to be fair and judge both parts as one film. I need to wait for Part 2 to see if they did make a solid, true adaptation overall. But I have faith that they will :)",1351296000,,4117,4.333766233766234
5180195,5,B008RV5K5E,"I thought that this would be a return not of an older Bruce Wayne but someone within his late 30's or early (very early 40's). But as the story progressed, it took me by surprise that the writers of this animated masterpiece would allow the use of an older Bruce Wayne to return once again as the Caped Crusader to clean up the streets of Gotham by reliving some of the glory days of yesteryear. I thought it was very good and full of action. A hidden dark side to the much older Bruce Wayne than his younger days but still the same ""Smart Detective"" as ever but getting the job done to right what was wrongfully missing within the public's outcry of what was missing for 10-15? years of justice, with the help of the new sidekick, within this animated yet brooding character that only Bruce Wayne could bring back to the streets of Gotham!

Over the past half decade or so, Bruce Timm and company have done an amazing job of creating these DTVs. Ranging from completely original stories to adaptions of popular story, so it was no surprise that The Dark Knight Returns was one of the most highly requested films for the group. With much joy, and a little reservation, we finally get The Dark Knight Returns. A story so dense that it becomes the first film adaption to warrant two separate DTVs!
The Dark Knight Returns retains the style of the comic book fairly well. Which is both a blessing and a curse. The style loans itself to animation well as we've seen in both Batman: The Animated Series and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, but it's also not a style I'm personally too keen on. Well that is a bit strong, I really don't care for the overly bulky Batman design that this book used. It's just not a style that makes sense, and not many characters actually retain it. It really stands out when Batman is interacting with the new Robin in this film. His hands are also as large as her body!
My dislike for the art-style aside, the film does animate and look fantastic in motion. Some of the more memorable moments, and especially some of the fights, look extremely wonderful when animated. Some of the shots for shots from the comics feel a little forced in motion, but it was cool to see that they included all of the iconic moments (from the first half at least) while building around them.
I'd be honest, I haven't read the actual source material in nearly a decade so when I tell you it follows the story pretty straight-forward, I'm only going off of what I remembered. I'm sure there was stuff cut, but I couldn't point you to exact moments or pieces of dialog off the top of my head. I have read enough Frank Miller stuff to know that almost all of Batman's internal monologues had been cut from the film. Though, as a rule, a character speaking in their head isn't as easy to convey in animation. It's really a comic book thing.
The writing on the other hand is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it, I will chalk up to the source material. Frank Miller is a lot of things, but the most elegant writer he is not. A lot of the dialogue comes off as a bit hokey or stilted not only in their delivery, but just how they are phrased. Granted, I'm sure some of it is a product of the era. Slang from the 80s probably hasn't carried over well nearly 30 years later!
On the bright side, the voice cast they got for this film is top-notch. While I have already expressed my love for Kevin Conroy as Batman, Peter Weller (Robocop!) as an elderly Batman/Bruce Wayne though knocks the performance out of the park. He just works so well for me, and he has a voice that is kind of serious and gravely without coming off as a bit of parody (still love you Bale!). And it's not just Weller who shines in this cast, David Selby as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Jackson as Bruce's loyal butler, Alfred, are perhaps have some of the best parts in the movie for me. Alfred is his usual dry self, but he does it with such charm that it is endearing. Selby brings a nice warmth, but toughness to Gordon, who is now up there in age, but dealing with a more reformed Gotham.
The rest of the cast does a decent job, but aren't giving as much screen-time to work with aside from Ariel Winter as Carrie Kelley, the new Robin. I think she does a great job in the role, but there's nothing in this film that makes me believe that she should have been Robin. The whole idea of Robin has always been a bit of a stretch since Batman deals with really bad people. When Carrie first dons the costume, which is just a Halloween costume, we see her come off a bit clumsy and reckless to the point where you fear she may get herself killed. The fact that she is able to take down the Mutant Leader, or at least distract him long enough for Batman to do his thing, seems a bit contrived from what little we had seen of her up until that point. Yes, much like any Robin, she eventually does get training from Batman, but she hadn't earned much up to that point!
Which brings us to the final point, the actual story in the movie. If you've read the comic, you pretty much know all the beats. We're about a decade out from the last sighting of the Batman. Gotham is in relative peace aside from a new gang calling themselves The Mutants, and Bruce is dealing with his life beyond the cape. Slowly, the pieces of the peace start to fall aside as the return of an old foe, Two-Face, triggers some events that leads to the return of Batman. Batman does battle with the mutants, which eventually escalates to an all-out assault planned on Gotham City.
That's pretty much the extent of the plot. A lot of the political undertones from the source material have been removed from the adaption, though you still get discussion on whether or not Batman is better or worst for society.  Ultimately, it is an odd talking point since a lot of this is focused on Batman and you see how much good he does for Gotham, but it also does mean he tends to bring out the wack jobs...
And that's where The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 leaves off, it is a very smartly done cliffhanger. You are given a really solid movie from start to finish. It has a complete plot, but it dangles a very juicy carrot in front of you so that you will check out Part 2 when it drops next year. Sadly, I wish they would have been able to time the two releases closer together!",1351296000,2,5471,4.295256534365924

5180205,3,B008RV5K5E,"The original ""Dark Knight Returns"" graphic novel re-defined the concept of the term ""superhero"" while it paid hommage to the classic tale of the gallant champion who hangs up his sword/gun/weapon of choice to live a peaceful life only to find out that it doesn't fit him nor does it benefit the world that he lives in. This movie adaptation picks up the essence of that story but I felt that something was deeply missing when Bruce Wayne's/Batman's internal thoughts were removed during the creation of this film.

While I can't honestly say that I loved the finished product, I can't say that I hate it either. It's true to the essence of the printed page but it could have been TRUER if the filmakers focused on ALL of the words as well as the images of the original story. ""Sin City - The Movie"" is living proof that it could be done and it was a purer interpretation of a comic book masterpiece than THIS film was! Perhaps the creators of this project should have watch THAT film to see how Frank Miller tells a story with words as powerfully as he does with pictures and revealing that two mediums, words and pictures, working together can be far more effective than one in the right hands!

As a child, I've owned Classic Illustrated Comics/Golden Records combination packs of several literary classics, ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and ""The Time Machine"" among them. I enjoyed listening to the records while I was reading the comics and appreciated the adapted stories even more as a result of using this method. Perhaps using a similar technique, read the original book while watching the film, is the best way to enjoy the central story rather than just watching it on the screen. At least a new viewer would understand why Bruce Wayne's story nearly ended in the opening act, what he was thinking during his tense battle scenes and why this film was made in the first place while a fan of the graphic novel can re-read it while enjoying a well-presented soundtrack and moving pictures!

The newscasters, the lady who gets mugged by the guy who says, ""Mommy, come here, Mommy"", the cab driver with the beard and pony tail, the psychiatrists, Lana Lang, all of them... they didn't change them one bit.

Frank Miller changed the perception of Batman forever with this graphic novel (which I have in plastic bags tucked safely away in the basement) from the smiley happy Super Friends version to the dark tortured soul that we see today. This animated feature does deviate a bit from Miller's vision, but excellent story, excellent voice acting, animation, even the music. This is definitely worth your time and money. In fact, after I rented it, I went out and bought the DVD. Only bummer is that we have to wait a year for Part 2, but this really needed to be longer than the typical 70-80 minute standard format allows for. Hope they keep up the quality in Part 2.

5180231,5,B008RV5K5E,"While I have read the original Dark Knight Returns comic book more out of curiosity than in earnest, this adaptation really brings the story to life, even though it's now broken into two parts, which makes some sense if you're trying to avoid compressing a good story like that into 90 minutes or 2 hours. (Imagine Crisis On Infinite Earths being done like this...that would take up 4 to 6 parts in an adequate adaptation!)

Anyway, I like the choice of Peter Weller, best known for the main character of ""RoboCop"", voicing Batman, which seems rather suitable for the grim and gritty world he has to face after his retirement and watching the world (and Gotham City) go to hell all around him. Batman just can't stop being Batman, and in times that are more brutal he has to be prepared and change with the times, not to mention handle the fact that he isn't the spry young man he once was. I like Carrie Kelley being Robin, which gives the Batman and Robin relationship more of a father and daughter relationship, given that her own parents are more interested in getting high than raising a child. The whole first part is basically Batman dealing with the leader of the Mutants and Harvey Dent released from Arkham with a whole new face, yet is unable to escape the monster he has become from years of being Two-Face.

The animation and artwork is excellent, as a sort of mix between the original comic book style and Superman/Batman: Public Enemies. I can't wait for Part 2 to come out, which will tell the other end of the story.",1350604800,2,1533,4.550724637681159

The animation was OK, but not great.  The voice acting was good.

I hope this is made into a live action movie at some point. Nolan could do it justice.

This is THE seminal Batman story that all others since owe a great debt.  Any true Batman fan should read the comic/graphic novel.

I enjoyed the extras and am looking forward to the next installment.

UPDATE:

Its strange to update a movie/dvd review, but here goes...

I updated my review of this installment from 3 stars to 4 stars.  After seeing Part 2 and then watching both in tandem, I've come to have a greater appreciation for Part 1.  My only criticism of this installment is chiefly due to how the mutant gang and their leader were represented.  They (the mutants) had an old school Saturday morning cartoon villain look about them that, to me, made them seem too nonthreatening.

While Part 1 can stand on its own legs, it definitely stands taller and is more satisfying when paired with Part 2.  I'm not sure why it was necessary to break it up into 2  parts.",1350345600,2,1361,4.471544715447155

5180239,3,B008RV5K5E,I will offer this sentiment.  As a fan of the comic I found the visual translation for the most part excellent.  There were some miscues and things that I just don't think they did correctly but it was for the most part accurate.  What ruined it for me in many ways was the lack of the third voice.  In the comic they let you hear what the characters were thinking.  This added so much emotion and sometimes humor to the story.  This not being included was such a huge miss.  There were jokes unfinished and for the most part really made me miss the comic.  The other miss was Peter Weller.  He delivered his lines like Robocop...emotionless.  There was no grit in his voice.  Overall after paying for this I do not plan to get the second one.  It was just not enjoyable for me.  My son however did see it and not having a sense of the comics like it.  This is the only reason it gets an ok instead of dislike.

The only thing that I missed was the inner monolog that Batman has throughout the story. A few things are replaced with dialog but there are not audible thoughts.

My only real minor complaints would be that it's broken up into two parts which I thought was sort of pointless not mention having to wait 'till 2013 for part 2. That, & there aren't any interesting special features with this edition. Nevertheless, the stunning animation compliments the brilliant voice cast as does the epic tale in which they've truly made something unique & not just a reproduction of the original graphic novel. While the classic comic has a legendary reputation in the annals of the funny book industry this movie is  quite approachable to non comic readers too. The story is dark, violent, & thankfully the heart of the source material hasn't been watered down in any way. Heck even some of the music score sounds like it's right out of some action crime drama from the late 80's. ""Batman -Gotham Knight"" & ""Green Lantern -1st Flight"" were my personal favorites of the DC animated movies but ""Batman -The Dark Knight Returns"" now owns that spot too.",1350086400,,1100,4.851063829787234

Alot of the staging was flat and coincidentally so were the majority of vocal performances. I feel like Peter Weller went in to the booth and they just used his first take on every line.

In a cartoon you expect things to be amped up just a little bit, this felt more like a storyboard with how little things actually moved and how flat every composition was. I think the ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" episode of Batman: TAS did a much better job of interpreting the source material.

That said, if you've never read the comic, this is probably going to be at least mildly enjoyable. I'm glad I rented and didn't buy. I'd suggest you do the same. Enjoy!",1350086400,,767,4.510791366906475

There was no inflection in his voice during the entire movie.  It was the same mono-toned, grave and slow speech regardless of when he was speaking with Gordon or speaking with the Mutant leader.  Why not re-cast Micheal Ironside who did a great job when they visited The Dark Knight Returns on the animated series.

5180254,4,B008RV5K5E,"I have really been liking the new DC animated movies that have been coming out over the past couple years, I think they do an exceptionally good job on the Batman movies. When this one came out I had to pick it up.

For those not aware, or that savvy, when it comes to the Batman Comics(myself included) this movie is based upon the pivotal and epic graphic novel/run of Batman comics, with the same title, written by the renowned Frank Miller (Sin City, 300, ...etc) . I personally have not read the entire collection, but it is pretty well known that this story, released in the mid to late 1980's, was one of the pivotal works, that brought Batman back into the public eye, and really helped to re-define the character. After this story was released, the ""Adam West Batman"" of the 1960s was finally set to rest, and the gritty/dark Batman mythos took the forefront in public's mind. This story set the stage for the Tim Burton films, and their dark setting. In addition, this story was released at the time where comic books were making their shift from child to more mature audiences: this story solidified that.

This story is about the return of Batman, after retirement, to once again clean the streets of Gotham City. Unlike most Batman stories this movie does not really include many members of the ""Rogues Gallery"" but focuses on his clash with some new villains. I do not want to give away too much of the story for those who have not read or watched the story, but it is pretty cool to see a Batman story set in setting not so familiar to most Batman fans. Due to the size of the story, DC has decided to release this story in two separate movies. While this might piss some people off, I think it was a pretty good move, and kept them from skimping over the details and content, in order to meet the format. The story is very engaging, and lets the viewer see characters in a very different yet familiar way

Like most current DC animated movies, the animation has a anime' influenced style. I would not say that I really enjoyed the animation, but you can see that the some of the original ""Frank Miller"" look was kept. I personally would have preferred the movie be almost a complete Frank Miller graphic novel brought to life, but I am not sure if that would have marketed well. In short, I think DC settled for a nice middle ground, when bringing this story to life.

The only complaint I really have with this DVD is the special features. We do get a sneak peak into part 2 of this series, which is cool, but besides some trailers, not much is offered, maybe because this is a one disc version of the movie, and maybe they will release a two disc version with more stuff. I would have really like to see a documentary on the original graphic novel, highlighting it's influence on the world of comics, included with this DVD.",1349740800,4,2842,4.438697318007663

I have mixed feelings about Robin, but I enjoyed the Bat-Tank very much.

Most if not the majority of them were customers that thought this was the Nolan movie version. This Batman Dark Knight Animated film is suffering from low to bad reviews due to IDIOTS that lost the ability to read the ""Product Description"" portion which clearly states ""Format: ANIMATED"". Amazon needs to adopt some way to Vote off reviews that are NOT related to the product itself due to the INCOMPETENCE of some ""reviewers"" ability to read and inform themselves of what exactly they're purchasing.

Now on to the Animated movie. AMAZING!!! Having read the Novel I was excited to see this come out as the original Batman Animated series from the 90's did tease us with small clips here and there and gave us a taste of what it would be like to see the Novel animated. Now backed with outstanding performances from Peter Weller (RoboCop movies) who plays an aged Bruce Wayne/Batman and an almost exact frame to frame shot sequences from the comic books, it gave me chills. Whether you are a Batman, comic book fan or not, if you consider yourself a fan of good quality story telling and well done animation this is a great buy. Keeping this short and simple, lots of memorable moments that really stick out. Hearing Peter Weller's voice rumbling through my surround sound set up with one of my all time favorite quotes from the movie gave me goosebumps: ""You don't get it son, this isn't a Mud-Hole, it's an operating table...and I'm the surgeon.""

What a waste of 4 dollars on a rental. It's great. The animation was fantastic, the colors looks vibrant, I felt a real tension during it. I suppose it wasn't as hyper-violent as people have come to expect, but lots of movie and television violence is so over the top that it's almost humiliating that we believe it's possible for people to survive it. I thought the balance of violence, injuries, realistic fighting motions, and above all, restraint by the production team kept this movie fast paced, fun, and leaving the viewer dying for more.

I almost wish I hadn't watched it. I wanna see Part II really bad.

NOTE: This is a animated movie of the classic comic The Dark Knight Returns, one of Batman's best stories. If you loved this movie, and you're looking for something to tide you over until Part II, check out the graphic novel, it's going for $7.49 used.

After reading the book, I very much wanted to see a very dark, serious Batman. Obviously, thats not what any of the original Batman movies were about until Chris Nolan started directing them.

Ive never been into watching this cartoon series either, as the style is just to casual for Batman for my taste.

In a world of Toy Storys, I just cant watch minimal animation techniques where only mouths move when speaking and animation is conservative. This isn't 1970 Speed Racer...this technique just does not convey the character emotions that animation could bring to this story using modern techniques.

That said, I gave it a shot, and watched about 15 minutes. It depressed me similarly to the way the first Michael Keaton Batman movie depressed me. Just not the way I would personally like to see this story introduced to moviegoers who haven't read the story.",1349395200,,1021,4.719101123595506

The voice acting was hit and miss, Peter Weller did a very good job as Batsman, I would say that the main characters were good, the surrounding  characters were more like who they could find the read the script. There was very little emotional impact to be from the  supporting characters to me.

The animation was what you could find on any of the current DC shows now on TV. I could Bothell be feel a little cheated that the Frank  Miller cutting edge novel was just not there. The story was very true to the book,  but  I wonder how well the novel would''ve done, with  Archie comics drawing? The other thing that bothered me  it seemed they  could not make up their minds whether to make this as aother DC show, or go for more adult content.

Split into two parts, TDKR P1  tells the story of a future Gotham City where the Batman has retired and the city is being overran by violence and crime once again. Bruce Wayne now tries to hide from the demon that is the mantle of the Bat and suppress his need to right the wrong. Bruce eventually gives in to his true-self and the Batman returns to bring those who would threaten the innocent to justice, something he does in a surprisingly violent (for a cartoon) way. The animation is top-notch, and it is exciting to see that we are getting an improvement on these films on every release. Frank Miller originally wrote this masterpiece back in the eighties. A time when comic books were near extinction, Miller decided to turn the tide with a violent and dark story that brought the Batman, and comic books into a new era. Warner Premiere's release is not only the best of the bunch but also the most loyal to the source material. With a few tweaks here and there, ones that can easily be overlooked, The Dark Knight Returns is bright look into the future of what the genre is capable of entertaining us with. As usual there are two episodes from the vault of previous DC animated show, on this disc 2 episodes from Batman: The Animated Series which are Two-Face centric. Also on the disc is a 45-minute documentary about Bob Kane, a sneak peek into The Dark Knight Rises Part 2, and some trailers. Nothing to get overly excited for, I am actually very disappointed that we are not getting any more DC Showcase shorts, the real treat is waiting for part two to be released in early 2013!

I intend to skip all the Joker parts of part two (they REALLY screwed this up!), but Part One is terrific. My only criticism of part one is that much of the terrific narration from Batman/Bruce Wayne was omitted, lines that helped create the tone of the book.

I was DYING to see/hear that scene in the animated movie adaptation of The Dark Knight Returns. It wasn't in it. I guess they decided to leave it out. Mildly disappointing, but I got over it.

I didn't read this until college when discussing comics with someone who had read more comics than I had.  Since then it is the model of batman I have compared all the movie renditions to.
The inner dialog, the obsessiveness, all things very detailed out and excellent.

Peter Weller was a fantastic pick for old batman, his voice has a great gravelly roughness.
The pick for Carrie was fabulous, her delivery was spot on in my mind, it a had youthful unapologetic ring to it.

They used alot of the cinematic feel of the original book, with the cuts to news coverage and everything.
Since this was part 1 they close with joker whispering 'Batman....darling'.

The extras include a sweet little min-doc on Bob Kane himself and what a larger than life character he was.

If you are a fan of the graphic novel I would higly suggest it.

The only disappointing note to me would be it reduces the possibility of a live action adaption.  (Oh we did that)",1349049600,,1093,4.574358974358974

I liked the revealing nature of an aging Batman as he struggles to perform feats he could easily do in his youth, but also revealing as he still struggles with and is still haunted by the death of Jason Todd/Robin.  Was not a big fan of the ""new"" Robin though, I think they could have done that role a little better.  If you're complaining because it didn't say ""animated movie"" somewhere in the title, the front and back covers should have been a clue that this was not the Batman movie you were looking for.",1349049600,,617,4.442477876106195
5180287,4,B008RV5K5E,"I have a comic vlog on YouTube in which I discuss mostly each week's comic releases, but occasionally I throw in a subject video about this or that, and one that I felt that I was compelled to do was one about the year 1986, or as I call it, The Year That Changed Comics Forever. You had two major releases in the same year. One was Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' WATCHMEN, which for the first time, really introduced the deconstruction of the superhero to the comic book world, and holds the spot for the only comic book to be considered one of Time Magazine's Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century. The other was from a very popular writer/artist who had come from an extraordinary run on DAREDEVIL to DC Comics in 1985 with a strange and wonderful avant-garde fusion of a dystopian future blended with ancient Eastern mythology called RONIN. This still-young artist then, in 1986, decided to create a future vision of one of DC's most beloved and iconic characters that was brutal, dark, uncompromising and socially conscious. That man was Frank Miller, and that book that he created is one of the undisputed masterpieces in Comic Book history: BATMAN - THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.

THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS starts with a simple premise: It's the future, and it has been exactly ten years to the day that Gotham City and the world had their last sighting of Batman. And although it's not explicitly discussed, it is due to a few different things; the main reason being the implied death of a partner, and the other (and this is only an assumption) being that all of Batman's rogue's gallery as well as all elements of organized crime have either left Gotham, are behind bars or dead, or are in Arkham Asylum. So we have Bruce Wayne, a somewhat empty shell of a man trying his best to enjoy his retirement. We also have Commisioner Jim Gordon, facing his own mandatory retirement. The two are friends moreso than they ever were before because Gordon now knows that Bruce was Batman. This future is far from perfect though. The criminals of this era are products of a very new generation. They call themselves The Mutants, and they are not a gang of unruly kids; they are thrill-seeker killers that run around the city butchering children and nuns and anyone they want to show their depravity. Bruce, still a haunted man, and still very much an obsessive man, can no longer continue to ignore the threat they pose. And on a storm-toss'd night, suddenly The Batman reappears to wage his one-man war on crime.

Now, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is far more than that description. It is epic in its scale of emotional storytelling arcs and the amount of characters it has; it's epic in its battles; it's epic because it needs to be. A return of Batman after a 10-year absence requires something of such a grand scale that a mere 70-odd minutes would not be enough to contain it. So the adaptation by Bob Goodman and the direction by Jay Oliva smartly divided this into two segments and this film is Part One, which covers the first two chapters (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS; THE DARK KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT) of Miller's four-chapter tale. And sometime in 2013, we'll get Part Two. Unlike the previous Miller adaptation to be made by DC Animated, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, which was compact enough to be parsed into about 70 minutes of film, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is frankly too large for that.

Now, many of the less-than-or-moderately-positive reviews of this film from people who are fans of the source material are upset because they feel the film waters down so many of the elements of the savagery and biting social commentary that made the book into what it is. And I can totally understand and appreciate that point of view. There was stuff in the film that wasn't in the book and vice versa. There were lines of dialogue from the book I desperately wanted to hear the gruff voice of Peter Weller, playing Bruce Wayne/Batman, say on screen. But for the most part, they kept a great deal of the brutality in, like the scene with The Mayor and The Mutant Leader is the one that sticks out heaviest in my mind. There are moments of instantly recognizable panel composition from the book, including the immortal image of a silhouetted Batman brightly backlit by a lightning bolt. Much of the stylized street slang of the Mutants is present.

But film, live-action or animated, is a much different animal than comics. Comics can offer so many different styles of narrative. Such as internal monologue that you can read into the mind of your characters, giving you insight, and while that's great on the page, it can really hurt your momentum in a film. Oliva ignores almost all of the internal monologue, except for a pretty glaring scene in which he decides to use it. That moment is very important, but because we are treated to the internal monologue there, the viewer who is familiar with the source material wants more, leading to the aforementioned disconnect. It really proves the old chestnut of how you can please some people some of the time, but you can't please everyone all the time.

From a casting standpoint, Andrea Romano (who's been at this game for decades) assembles a list of great voice actors that are largely character actors that have appeared in some films and a lot of television. Weller is spot-on perfect. He has just enough of the world-weariness, but enough of the gravelly intonation that makes Batman a true bad@$$. David Selby, of shows like the original DARK SHADOWS and FALCON CREST, does an excellent job as the aging Gordon. Wade Williams, who has been in just about every television show from the 90's through today (and was even the Warden of Blackgate prison in Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) does a commendable job as the ""rehabilitated"" Harvey Dent. The real standouts here for me were young actress Ariel Winter as the voice of Carrie Kelley aka Robin and Michael McKean (THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and was even Perry White in TV's SMALLVILLE) as psychologist Bartholomew Wolper. Winter gives the youthful energy and strength that Carrie needs, and McKean gives the right air of pompous superiority as Wolper.

The animation style doesn't totally ape that of Miller, but it certainly shows its influence with its heavy use of almost cube-like faces and enormous hulking bodies that give the characters that even-larger-than-life aesthetic. Occasionally, in particular with vehicle sequences, the movement gets bogged down by CGI, which can be really jarring. But the fight and action choreography is very fluid and the big fights are very brutal.

DC Animated Films, under the auspices of mastermind Bruce Timm, have made quite a name for themselves since 1992, when BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES first premiered. That groundbreaking series made way for what is now considered the DC Animated Universe. They've recently been releasing a slew of nearly full-length animated films based on either some of the more famous characters or some extremely popular comic book story arcs, from characters like WONDER WOMAN and GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT or GREEN LANTERN: EMERALD KNIGHTS (which are not from a specific story arc) to SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE DOOM, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, THE NEW FRONTIER, and SUPERMAN VS. THE ELITE. These have worked to varying degrees of success, but THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE is one of the more successful attempts at bringing something to the screen that is something of an impossible undertaking. They know that there are legions of fans that consider DKR their ""Batman Bible"", and trying to please all of them by simply translating the book page-for-page would have been a disaster. You have to have enough surprising moments in the film that will keep the audience on its toes, or you might as well do a motion comic.

My main complaint with this film is that I don't know how successful it will be as a storytelling experience unless you're familiar with the source material. I think that there's too much included that, just from a style standpoint, is really going to be confusing for fresh eyes to see it. I have faith in the audience, but I think that the only reason that I'm giving this four instead of five stars is because I don't think that newcomers to this tale will be able to get as much out of it as they should because of its very faithful adaptation.

As it is, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE should please longtime fans of the comic, but might not appeal to the newer fans as much as the Nolan Batman films have been able to do.",1348963200,5,8532,4.732347007397444

5180292,5,B008RV5K5E,"As much as I liked the Dark Knight Returns comic book, I didn't LOVE it as much as other people. I personally felt that there were plenty of other great Batman adaptations. I also had slightly lower expectations for the film since I felt that many of the more recent DC offerings were slightly rushed or disappointing. After watching the film though I have to say that I was pretty blown away. I think the movie is better than the comic book. The film is simply outstanding. The voice acting was great and the music was some of the coolest music that I have ever heard in an animated film. It really sets the mood perfectly. Some people have complained that the film removed some of Batman's inner dialogue and that the story was padded to divide it up into two films. I couldn't disagree more. The story is paced perfectly and it would have been impossible to fit both parts into one movie.  Also, having the inner dialogue wouldnt have worked as well in a film version. It works better for a comic book.  What makes this a better adaptation than the comic book is the hard hitting action and violence. Its hard to feel the impact of the fight scenes in the comic book but in the movie its brutal and fun to watch. This movie has got it all: great voice acting, great story, brutal action, a very dark Batman which we all love, and some fantastic music that really takes it to another level.

 Bottom line: If you are slightly interested in the movie but have been disappointed by some of the recent DC animated movies I strongly recommend that you pick this up or at least rent it. (Come on! If you are not going to buy it you at least have to rent it!!)

This is definitely one of DC's best. Right up there with Under the Red Hood and Mask of the Phantasm.",1348876800,3,1759,4.318181818181818

5180297,5,B008RV5K5E,"After being disappointed by Year one (which was ok at best), I went into this expecting the same sort of thing. The adaptation of Year One was very bland and rushed and they made many changes that made no sense to me. The acting was sub par and the animation and music did not come close to matching the feel of the comic.

I'm relieved that TDKR part I doesn't share the same problems as the Year One adaptation. This one almost feels like a high quality theatrical film and not at all like a straight-to-dvd flick. Like Year One, This isn't a panel for panel accurate adaptation, but the changes they made here aren't as silly. For example, The Mutant Leader grins when he sees his gang gathered, just before Batman tackles him. That is not in the comic, but I thought that was a pretty nice touch. I'm also glad this was split into two parts because it needed to be.

The voice acting was top-notch. Peter Weller was perfectly cast as an older Bruce/Batman. Conroy would have felt out of place here so I'm glad they went with Weller. Same goes for the rest of the cast, great performances. The music was my favorite part of this because it has a very 80s feel. It also sets the mood of the film so nicely, as a score should. There's even a scene where Bruce is passing some gang members who are blasting 80s pop from a boombox. The one downside for me is the animation, It's well animated and the simplified Miller designs are great, but it's a tad bright in some places and too colorful in others. For the most part, this movie looks very much like an animated version of Miller's classic graphic novel. So this still gets 5 stars from me. Great Job to Jay Oliva and everyone else involved in this one.",1348876800,3,1706,4.344827586206897

A convincing performance, he transformed into the role rather than simply reminding that ""oh yeah, this is the guy who was Robocop a long time ago.""  I realize it's an adaption of F Millers classic, but some of the characters and political discourse is really dated, like watching blade runner for the first time 20 years after it was made. They wanted to keep close to the source material but the staying power of this film would've been increased if they updated a few things (Robin, speech and design of some of the thugs and some of the slang- just my opinion, I'm sure I'd feel differently if I had a closer connection with the source material). Good story and art, but not the holy grail of comics as some portray it. Not something I'd view multiple times, but a fun watch. And that's all I've got.",1348876800,3,932,4.482352941176471

5180300,4,B008RV5K5E,"Warner Premiere and DC Comics have topped themselves with the Blu-ray / DVD release of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1."" After the release of ""Batman: Year One,"" the only logical choice for the Caped Crusader's next solo animated feature was evident. It was time for Frank Miller's other beloved and critically acclaimed graphic novel to be adapted for the screen.

Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" not only had an effect on the entire comic book industry, it influenced director Tim Burton to make a serious film adaptation based on the super hero that turned into a multi-billion dollar franchise. Many fans and historians would say it is responsible for the popularity of comic book movies today.

It's been ten years since Batman's last appearance in Gotham City. Bruce Wayne has retired the cape and cowl for a life of tedium and drinking. He meets occasionally with Commissioner Gordon for drinks and to talk about the state of the world. Gordon knows Wayne's secret and is one of his only confidants.

Bruce begins having horrible nightmares about his parents' deaths and witnesses Gotham City digress even further into the depths of depravity at the hands of a new criminal syndicate calling themselves the Mutants. He's driven to suit up once again to take on the homicidal maniacs and show the citizens of Gotham City that they need not live in fear any longer.

""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" is the best animated feature film DC and Warner Premiere have released. There's no other way of putting it. It feels epic and holds a cinematic flare that the other entries in the DC animated super hero movie franchise haven't accomplished. That's not to say they aren't good or worthy of praise. However, this takes the medium to a whole new level.

The animation is top notch and, although it doesn't mimic Frank Millers artwork for the book, there's a certain respect towards the unique style of the illustrations reflected in the film. Batman is larger than life and as bulky as the Hulk, but isn't quite as ""abstract"" as Miller's interpretation of him in the graphic novel. This is as close to a perfect representation of the book as I can imagine.

My only complaint is that there are a few spots where the plot jumps around a bit and gets a little hard to follow. They jump from one thing to the next so quickly with brief or no explanation. The viewer is left to just keep up and embrace the fast pacing once the movie gets rolling.

Peter Weller does a wonderful job bringing an older and weary Bruce Wayne to life. When he hits the streets for the first time in ten years, you can hear the satisfaction in his voice at re-embracing his long-forgotten mission of ridding the streets of Gotham City of the filth and crime that overtakes it.

The Blu-ray version of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" consists of quite a few treats for fans. There's a sneak peek of Part 2 and ""Batman / Superman: Public Enemies."" Two featurettes are included entitled ""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story"" and ""Her Name is Carrie... Her Role is Robin."" There are also two bonus cartoons from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" featured. A section of the ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" digital comic is found as well.

""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" will be the animated feature all future entries into the DC franchise will be measured by. They've set the bar high with this one. With a spectacular looking and sounding high-definition movie experience and some satisfying special features, this is a recommended purchase for all super hero fans.",1348876800,41,3591,4.751203852327448

5180302,5,B008RV5K5E,"They called it the 'Dream' project, the 'Big' one. So big in fact that this is a review of part 1 of this new DCAU film.

'The Dark Knight Returns' was the comic that changed the comic book world forever with a story that was so brash and dark, the camp and classic good vs. evil was shattered. I always knew that there would be an animated film down the road and now it is finally here. I made sure to read the first two parts of the entire comic before I purchased this film and it was good to do so. The film adaption of this story is so beautiful with a few small subtile differences which are barely noticiable especially if you haven't read the origonal material in a while. The changes don't destroy the film at all because they stuck very close to it and really made it work. The voice cast was great. It took a while for me to warm up to Peter Weller voicing Batman, because I know that Kevin Conroy and even Bruce Greenwood would have been able to voice Batman in this film just as well. Still, he did a great job and the rest of the cast inclucing Ariel Winter, Gary Anthony Williams, Michael McKeon all contributed wonderfully. The action is just as intense in the film. The punches are earthshattering the faceoffs are hard hitting and intense and nothing is held back in the slightest. One thing I love about WBs DCAU is the fact that these are real fans putting together shows and movies with the comic fan in minds. Making sure it is something that makes the viewer happy, but also seeing how far they can push the bar in the world of animation as well as showing that animation can be for adults as well as kids.

Of course, 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' will not be perfect until the second half is released, but I am definitely going to be one of the first in line to pick it up and complete the story. I am actually hoping that this will not be the last of the 'dream/big' projects in the DCAU film library. I would love Crisis on Infinate Earths', 'Blackest Night' and especially 'Kingdom Come'. Still, after seeing this film released I have a feeling there are more treats in store for us fans.",1348876800,,2118,4.279301745635911
5180303,3,B008RV5K5E,"Please don't get me wrong. This is by no means a bad film and it does tell Miller's story without changing it much. That is certainly a win. I simply expected this film to be more engaging.

The ingredients are all there, but the filmmakers didn't take it to the next level. Frank Miller's edge, wit, style and intensity are all watered down in favor of moody set pieces and static scenes. I wish the director would have incorporated more combat and martial arts instead of so much mindless automatic weapon fire. Most of the action choreography consists of gang members standing in place and rapidly shooting their guns. That's noise, not action! The volume control for my remote got a better workout than most of the henchmen.

The animation is mostly attractive and at times it resembles an episode of Batman the Animated Series, but for mature audiences of course. Some of the toon-shaded computer generated effects made me feel trapped inside a sub-par video game. This project should be treated with epic reverence rather than bargain budget tactics.

I felt at arms-length with the protagonists throughout the story and that's something that does not happen with the novel. The voice talent is serviceable, yet the screenwriters neglected to add enough character development for the voice actors to work with and it shows.

Again this is not a bad movie. It's just not among the best Batman animated pieces I've seen. I anticipated this pre-order more than any other in my queue. I wanted to love it! Instead, it will likely collect dust on my the back shelf of my Blu-ray collection.  The source material deserves better than this. I'm going to pull out Miller's novel and read it again this weekend. C+",1348876800,5,1711,4.8061224489795915
5180304,3,B008RV5K5E,"I know that this is one of the most esteemed graphic novels of all time and it would be nearly impossible to
successfully adapt this Frank Miller classic to animated story.  That being said, since it still bears the name
""The Dark Knight Returns"", there's still going to be a myriad of comparisons to the printed version of the graphic
novel.  Long story short, this feature doesn't hold up.  The gritty, dark, brooding, and out-right shocking work of Miller
is replaced with the clean, edited, & tamed work of the DC animation studio.  Sure, it's cool to see some of my favorite scenes
from the novel played out with moving characters, but ultimately this Dark Knight pulls too many punches for my liking.
Several of the major sticking points for me were... First, taking a very ""R"" rated comic, if not THE R rated comic that set the tone for
all others to follow, and turning it into a ""PG"" romp.  All the changes that had to be made to the plot & story to accommodate this
were just too much for me to stomach.  Second, what made the graphic novel so great, at least in my opinion, was the narration provided
by Bruce Wayne/Batman throughout the story.  It's something no other Batman story has ever properly done before or after...in Miller's comic
Bruce Wayne, Batman, & the Bruce/Batman narration where like 3 separate characters. Taking out the inner dialog from Batman takes a thrilling
scene like Batman's fight with Two Face and turns it into a dull punch-up that doesn't come close to capturing the power of what Miller was
able to conjure. Third & final, why adapt this novel to leave out major plot points?  No Superman references at all here...Unless the second installment is almost 2 hours in length, then a lot of Miller's original story is going to be left out.  I usually enjoy watching the comics that
DC's animation department adapt, but with this feature as well as Batman's ""Year One"", another Miller adaptation, I think it'd be best for
DC to look to other Dark Knight stories for inspiration and leave the Miller canon alone.",1348790400,6,2050,4.6565096952908585

I truly believe it manages to completely capture the spirit, action, and social commentary that Frank Miller embedded in his work.  However, you must remember, this isn't a motion comic.  Don't compare it side by side with the book and complain about changes.  If you prefer the book, read the book, but remember that film is a different medium.  There are certainly some changes, mostly pretty minor as far as plot goes, and it makes for a better film experience.  I for one was unsure what to think when I read that the filmmakers removed Batman's internal monologue.  Ultimately I think it was a great choice.  It would have really bogged down the film in terms of pacing, and they sometimes manage to get that monologue out through spoken words anyway.  Remember, being truer to the source does not make it a better film.  So on its own, it is a superbly crafted animated film.  Everything about it is smooth, action-packed, thought provoking, exciting, and just a complete joy to watch.  I have full confidence that Part 2 will blow me away just as much.",1348790400,,1188,4.681159420289855
5180308,4,B008RV5K5E,"1986 was a year marked by the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster, the Reagan/Gorbachev Nuclear Arms reduction talks breaking down, the first massive workplace shooting, the Iran-Contra scandal breaking and Geraldo Rivera opening empty mob vaults in prime time.  It was a very unsetting time, and into all this came a Batman story unlike any other that captured this uncertain time like a fleeing perp in a police helicopter searchlight.  Raw, poignant, satirical, and thrilling, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (TDKR) literally changed the comic industry forever.  One of the best elements of TDKR were the asides that Batman had as he comments on himself, his struggles and his mission.  These ""thought bubbles"" revealed a Batman that was indeed borderline psychotic, obsessive, and deeply driven.  Unlike previous Batman internal musing, this was the first time we ""heard"" what Bruce Wayne really thought about Clark Kent, himself, Harvey Dent and his war everlasting.  This is what distinguished TDKR from a average Batman story, and made it a classic.  Sadly, this animated version did not include any of these asides.

This animated version is very true to the art, style, and pace of the first two chapters of TDKR to include the satirical look on the media, but I think it missed being really great by omitting the Batman mental asides which allowed the reader to peer into a very uncomfortable place.  At the risk of sounding like a rabid fan-boy, I clearly understand the differences in the media and respect directorial discression; however, omitting Bruce Wayne's thoughts on Harvey Dent (for example) during the fight on the Gotham Towers changed a poignant and sad end to a life Bruce couldn't save into a Two-Face vs. Batman clip lifted from any of the animated series.  Perhaps we will have more in Part 2.

5180311,3,B008RV5K5E,"Really three 1/2 stars... May swing up or down once we have the whole movie (parts 1 AND 2) to judge.

So... BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART 1... Very satisfied in some regards, a bit bummed and underwhelmed in others. Strongest when it's focusing on Cary Kelly/Robin (despite one painfully bad bit of voice acting) and when dealing with the mutants. As with any film adaptation of a book I love, the question I have to ask myself isn't so much ""Is it as good as the book?"" (these things must be judged on their own merits and all that) but rather ""If I didn't know the source material, would I still even get it?"" Leaning towards: If you want a solidly fun, badass Batman movie, you got it... These yearly animated Batman features have been a joy, and this is a welcome addition. But if you're not familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novel, you'd be forgiven for not understanding why this is considered one of the BEST BATMAN STORIES EVER TOLD. As such, last year's BATMAN: YEAR ONE was way more satisfying, I dare say a cut above two out of three of Nolan's movies in many respects. This one, though, loses a LOT of impact and meaning for lack of Batman and Gordon's voice-over narration... Some visual sequences, for lack of it, became cases of ""Why are we even lingering on this/why is this even here?"" or (such as in flashback to parents' murder) ""Haven't we seen this in EVERY OTHER screen Batman? What's this depiction add?"" Inexplicable abridgments left the Two-Face subplot feeling almost superfluous... Harvey and his history are barely established enough for us to care that he falls straight back into crime, and there's zero suspense about whether or not he will. The more button-pushing controversial aspects are softened around the edges, but still very much present and not nearly as watered/dumbed down as I'd feared. Peter Weller has a fine Batman voice, except a bit too ""zen old wise man,"" not enough ""Psycho-Bats"" edge. Some key smaller scenes are rearranged a bit, in a ways that actually work really well. So does the split into two movies, actually. The fight with the mutant leader makes a fitting build-up/action-climax. Moving a certain cameo to the tale-end cliffhanger was a stroke of genius. Left me far more psyched for Part Two than I might otherwise have been... a reminder that this is, after all (much like Kill Bill) only the first half, and we won't truly have it in perspective 'til we're able to watch both halves.

In the context of DC's animated Batman films so far, this felt weirdly as though it was trying to be more of a piece with UNDER THE READ HOOD than YEAR ONE, which isn't necessarily bad, just... weird (the Christopher Drake score - which realizes it's own tuneful Batman theme, despite still trying way too hard to sound like Zimmer/Shore in places - is a big tipoff).",1348704000,3,2829,4.667334669338677

I know there are those who get all up in arms over any and all deviations from source material (which in this case are slight), however lets just consider for one moment the possibility that a film animated or otherwise can stand alone as it's own work.

That aside... This Film Is Fantastic.  It is Dark, Sharp, and Poignant.  It gives a well deserved homage to ""Batman The Animated Series"" while also taking strong stylistic cues from the great (and unfortunately largely forgotten) HBO Spawn t.v. series.  The whole thing is wonderfully rounded out by a stunning score, which gives the whole film an eerie  futuristic driving force, and hints back at the 80's distopian films like Blade Runner and John Carpenter's Escape From New York.  It almost feels like a subtle hint to the audience of the era the source material came from as well as the era it is about.  I was into it from the very beginning and stayed on the edge of my seat for the whole thing.

Batman the Dark Knight Returns Pt 1 is Great. The original comic is such a legendary and well known entity, I was worried they would ruin it but they did well.
It was a little to colorful - meaning I thought they would have went for a more muted coloring like the comic but overall that is my only complaint - other than missing a few cool images.

Despite being ripped violently into two pieces, the story still functions very well and reaches a natural climax in time for the credits to roll after a drawn-out 75 minutes. I fear the end result may be a less-dense arching plotline, especially as most of the political commentary was removed from this chapter (presumably as it won't be relevant until the second) but there's still more than enough pulp to go around. While the storyline is doggedly faithful (indeed, most of the dialog is copied verbatim from the source), the artwork is both influenced by and notably distanced from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's amazing work on the printed page. And, while that does rob the story of some of its character, the result is suitable enough; fresh but also familiar. Peter Weller turns in some decent work as the voice of Bruce Wayne, but I couldn't help but daydream about how Kevin Conroy would have approached the material.

5180320,5,B008RV5K5E,"I have been reading Batman stories for 25 years (since I began reading comics in college). Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns"" and his ""Batman: Year One"" are undeniably among the top ten greatest Batman stories ever told. Thus I was somewhat apprehensive of an animated adaptation of the Dark Knight Returns, as it is near and dear to my heart. I had very low expectations of the film, even though DC has been cranking out some really fine animated films over the past few years.

I was very excited when I watched my Blu-Ray of this film the other day. It is one of the best film adaptations, animated or live-action, that I have seen. The core essence of Miller's book permeates this movie, missing only the strong political satire of the book. Peter Weller does a top-notch job portraying the 55 year old Bruce/Batman. Every action/fight scene was felt in my very bones. This film only makes me want to get my Absolute Edition of the book out and re-read it for the ump-teenth time.

AND THIS FILM ONLY ADAPTS PART 1 OF THE BOOK! I can't wait for Part 2 to come out in 2013.

If one were to own the quintessential Batman films, s/he would own the three Christopher Nolan films, along with the animated Batman: Year One, and this one.

Be warned: Batman the Dark Knight Returns is rated PG-13. It is a brutal film...not intended for little kids. Heed the PG-13 rating. It is every bit the tough crime/action story that Frank miller portrays in his landmark book.

5180321,5,B008RV5K5E,"When I first learned Michael Keaton was going to portray Batman in 1989, I thought it was going to adapt this novel.  No so.  Many of the Batman movies have lifted elements of the the original Frank Miller graphic novel.  It doesn't disappoint me as a fan.  In fact, the movie condensed what could have been very long scenes of internal dialogue.  It moves along at a quick pace and is faithful to the source material.  I can't wait for part II.  Peter Weller portrays a 55 year old Batman very accurately.  This Batman doesn't have the physical agility he used to. He has a harder time keeping up, because of his years fighting crime.  It's these scenes that humanized the character and made him realistic.  It's why I loved the graphic novel in the first place.  It deals with aging and coping with change.  Something super hero comics never seem to do.

The battle with the mutant gang leader was better than the comic. The ferocity and brutality of the of the fight isn't watered down. This movie is as good as it gets with Batman.  I can't wait for the conclusion!",1348617600,,1069,4.471502590673575
5180322,4,B008RV5K5E,"Gotham City is a city plagued by escalating violence and social apathy. Someone needs to strike back at the criminals, and reawaken the social consciousness. There is a rumbling in Bruce Wayne's soul... something that he's locked away is teeming to get out.

The Graphic Novel, The Dark Knight Returns, by Frank Miller is quite possibly the greatest Batman story of all time. Fans have been begging for an adaptation since the mid-90s. Whatever the final product was, fans would hold it to the highest of standards. As a result, it becomes difficult to view the film and not see everything they left out.

I knew they'd have to soften it a little, at his best Frank Miller's pen is like a sledgehammer, knocking the wind out of you every chance he gets. I knew they'd have to sand down that edge. If it was just going to be a direct translation of the book, why even make a movie, you can just read the book. I know these things. But the biggest flaw in the adaptation is they excised the narration from the book. I know Narration doesn't ""work"" in a visual medium, but by removing the narration completely, I really feel they cut out the heart and soul of the original work.

The result is no matter how well the rest is executed, it feels a bit hollow.

But, if you're part of the group that was never exposed to the source material, then you're going to see Batman like you've never seen him before. An old man dispensing vigilante justice, striking back at misguided youths, and wrestling the power away from corruption and giving it back to the people. The only work he's ever done.

I'm not going to be critical of the voice cast. I'm not going to demand they cast Kevin Conroy in everything. Peter Weller is fine by me, and I like the girl from Modern Family as Carrie.

I wanted to give this Blu-ray a 4.5 out of 5, but I'm disappointed in the special features.

""Her Name Is Carrie... Her Role is Robin"" - A 12-minute featurette about Carrie Kelly, the firs female Robin and other girl characters.

""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story"" - A 1-Hour Documentary about Bob Kane, creator of Batman, which was already included in Batman: Gotham Knight (which I already own).

2 Episodes from Batman the Animated Series: Two-Face, part 1 and part 2. Which might be the only way to get theses episodes on Blu-ray for a long time.

Sneak Peak at Batman: The Dark Knight Retuns (part 2). Still LOOKS good, and I can't wait to hear Michael Emerson as the joker. He really pulls off an Old Joker in the preview.

A digital comic and trailers pad out the disk.

No commentary and a documentary I already own. And they didn't get Frank Miller to appear anywhere at all. I don't hate the movie, but I stand by that it's missing the charm of the original. Every fan of Batman should watch this, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Because the feature feels hollow and the special features don't save it, I give it overall 4-out-of-5. And if you haven't read the original book, you should consider buying it, if you liked the movie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-The-Dark-Knight-Returns/dp/1563893428/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a>.",1348617600,2,3202,4.708407871198569

5180324,5,B008RV5K5E,"Just like the elder Gotham cop tells the rookie, you're in for a show!  Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was and still is one of the best Batman stories ever told...period.  To see it very faithfully adapted for DC's animated movies is great.  Plus, they are trying to condense this story into the usual 65-70 minutes they do normally for their recent movies; they are making it longer to fully tell this tale the way it should be told.

Granted, I feel they could've just produced a long 2 hour animated movie in one package instead of making us wait.  But in a way that's half the fun...leave them wanting, even begging, for more!  Which is what this story did in the first place when it came out.  This story almost single handedly turned Batman into DC's number one superhero.  Which I think is cool even being an overall Superman fan.  Speaking of the Man of Steel...

Superman kind of becomes the bad guy in this story.  He's still technically on the side of right but he's a pawn, a puppet to be used at the beck and call of the government...which Supes allowed to happen!  Batman's presence is seen as a black hole on the ""law & order"" of the times in this story.  Superman is called in to stop him, and seems to agree why!  Before this story, Supes and Bats were always portrayed as close friends.  Miller turned that notion upside down and inside out.  He made a good point showing that while both heroes stand up against evil; their views on how to do it are completely different.

I'm happy to see this story come to life and see the action.  The only thing better would be a live action version.  Ultimately this is no doubt going to be one of the gems in the DC Animated Movie crown.  I'd even like to see them do the sequel, ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"", even though that story wasn't as good but it is the conclusion to the story.

5180325,3,B008RV5K5E,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that the internal monologue Batman offers througout the original graphic novel is crucial to establishing the mood of the story and choosing not to use it was a mistake.

While I think using a lot of the panels from the original works fantastically why they didn't just use it as a complete storyboard is beyond me.  In the book you never see Commissioner Gordon's right hand man, Merkel-- and here he's just a regular generic policeman.  In the book Batman isn't sure it's really Harvey committing the new Two Face Crimes while in this there's no question.

More of a mistake was the screenwriter's decision to re-write Frank Miller's dialogue-- WHY?  Why adapt a work rightfully admired by so many and then change crucial dialogue exchanges?  The amazing interplay in the first scene between Gordon and Bruce Wayne becomes a chance to summarize all of what's wrong with Gotham-- we already get it-- Gotham's a hell hole and Batman is retired, Miller handled this scene so much more effectively.

Even the opening scene, which in the book is hard to understand just what is going on but is explained when you get to the end of the sequence was brilliant.  Here it's dumbed down and spoon fed to us as if they were concerned that the audience would be confused for even a half second.

They made an admirable attempt at capturing the art of Frank Miller-- and for the most part it works, but I wish they had used black instead of the constant gray on the characters which makes it look like Anime (not an insult to those people who like it) but this would have been so much better if there were heavy blacks like we saw in the 60s with the classic JONNY QUEST.

The Voice actors are solid-- but there's still an element of people holding back--which can happen when you record each session separately in front of a microphone and don't have other actors to react to.  Peter Weller is in fine form as Batman, but sometimes it just feels flat.

The actor playing Commissioner Gordon verges on cartoony delivery which is often distracting.  Gordon should have been a commanding presence in this, instead he's a little goofy at times.

Overall, while I'm glad they did the adaption, and kudos for making it two parts instead of trying to jam this epic story into 85 mins, why the changes WB?  Miller's script was perfect as it was.

The average modern Batman fan whose never read the series will likely find this an exciting well done bit of animation, but to the die-hard Dark Knight fans (and yes Daniel, this came first long before the Christopher Nolan films) I think you'll be slightly let down as to what might have been.",1348617600,4,2663,4.586497890295359
5180326,2,B008RV5K5E,"25 years after the publication of the most important work of a popular superhero ever, and all the buildup to its long-awaited adaptation, its just . . . a letdown.

From the laughable Leno-esque chins to the lack of crucial voice-overs (which had worked SO WELL when you had Bryan Cranston voicing Jim Gordon in Batman:Year One), to the terrible fight animations to the terrible added dialogue . . . everything that could go wrong, did.

Peter Weller was great, and they used some iconic stills from the comic, otherwise it was hard to watch. Whenever it should've been brisk (the news shots), it was too long, and whenever it should've breathed (the first issue scenes), it rushed.

Of course, this all comes back to the decision to forgo any voice-over, which is probably the biggest mistake in this entire production.  Its simply not possible to do the story justice without it.  The first issue (which will always be the most important to me) has almost as much ""thought dialogue"" as actual spoken dialogue, from the main characters.

Sorry, but if you gut the best part of my favorite comic, I ain't buyin.

One of the better DC animated adaptations

Based on Frank Miller's classic 4 part mini-series ""The Dark Knight Returns"":
1. Batman vs. Harvey Dent
2. Batman vs. the Mutant gang
3. Batman vs. the Joker
4. Batman vs. Superman
This DVD adapts issues 1 and 2 above.

Miller's story from 1986 is one of the two DC miniseries (the other being Watchmen) that unfortunately led comics into the so-called ""Dark Age"" of the 90's, when comics had the dark, gritty feel of these books while neglecting to include what actually made these two series great: realistic (well, for comics), adult, intelligent plot-lines, deep characterization, and philosophical/political speculations.  One of the things that made this series (along with Watchmen) unique in its time was that it asked questions like ""why do super-heroes really do what they do?  Are they really ""good"" guys?  Are they, maybe, a little messed-up in the head?""  It began the ""de-construction"" of super-heroes, and made it impossible to look at them the same naive way again.

The story features a Bruce Wayne in his 50's who's been ""retired"" as Batman for the past 10 years.  The release of Harvey Dent (previously known as ""Two-Face"") from prison, coinciding with an increase in crime in Gotham city (largely involving a huge street gang calling themselves ""the Mutants"" (an X-Men reference?)) prompts Batman to come out of retirement.  This inspires a young teenage girl, Carrie, to become a new Robin, who will join Batman in his new war on crime.  Towards the end of the film, you'll see the most intense ""Batmobile"" ever seen.

The movie does a reasonably good job adapting the story, but it didn't knock my socks off, hence the 4 stars.  I think Peter Weller (Batman/Bruce) and Ariel Winter (Robin/Carrie) did fairly well as the voice actors.  Michael Emerson (Ben from ""Lost"") as the Joker only gets a line or two, but I think he'll do a good job in part 2 (to be released Winter of 2013?)  The artwork does a somewhat good job of matching Miller's work (at one point you get the iconic silhoutte with lightning flash from the book's cover), but it's a little too colorful in comparison with the graphic novel (dark and gritty, people!)  The CGI merges somewhat well with the cell animation, but it's a little distracting.  And yes, as other reviewers have mentioned, practically all the ""interior dialogue"" (and consequently a lot of the best lines) are gone.

Single-Disc DVD extras:
-Unskippable (but fast-forwardable) previews for ""Thunderstruck"" and a miscelleneous group of DC animated features
-Sneak Peek of The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2
-Sneak Peek of Superman/Batman Public Enemies: This is an old clip that speaks of the film as if it weren't already available.
-Trailers for ""Thundercats"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and an ad for DC Comics online.

Rated PG-13 for violence.  It can be pretty brutal, and I think they had to tone it down a little from the original book to keep it below an R rating.

5180328,5,B008RV5K5E,"I've been a fan of this graphic novel for close to 20 years now.  In fact, it's my favorite graphic novel of all time.  So, I was stoked when I found out they were making it into an animated film.  Naturally, I pre-ordered my copy, so I got it via UPS today.  It was really cool of Amazon to ship it ""early"" so that it was on my doorstep on the day of its release.

For starters, this is not the same as the graphic novel, but it's close.  Obviously, much of the ""text"" is missing, mostly the stuff dealing with Bruce's and other characters' interior dialogues.  They could have had the movie constantly narrated to include this text, but I hate constant narration, so I'm glad they didn't.  And, since it wasn't narrated, some of the interior dialog text has been changed into things the characters say, others are just expressed through actions.  Either way, it gets the point across without a constant narration.  Aside from that change, there are a few other minor changes.  Some parts are missing, mostly smaller parts, stuff that's not necessary to move the story along.  Some parts have even been moved to different parts of the story, I guess to change the flow slightly.  And there's a bit of added dialog that wasn't in the original comic.  Aside from those few minor changes, the story is mostly the same as the graphic novel.  People who are gung-ho about the movie makers sticking to the source material exactly will be disappointed by this, but I have no issues with it.  I thought the story came across well.

Animation wise, this film is along the lines of the other animated DC shows and films, which is to say it's good.  The comic has more detail to it but, when you consider how many times something has to be drawn in a comic VS how many times it has to be drawn in an animated movie, it's easy to say why they did this.

The voice acting was good.  I'm a big fan of Kevin Conroy as Batman, but Peter Weller did a great job.  So did everyone else.  I watched the sneak of part two on the DVD and I'm looking forward to Michael Emerson portraying the Joker in part two, even though I'm a huge fan of Mark Hamill as the Joker.

From the moment I heard that Peter Weller would voice Batman/Bruce Wayne, I had very high hopes. The main characters are fairly flawless, though I expect this new Robin (yes, the girl), will be featured a little more in the next volume, due out apparently this winter. It's not a disappointment - it leaves us wanted to watch Part Two RIGHT THEN. Flawless execution.

The special features are not up to par. Other reviewers have cited the fact that this graphic novel CHANGED the way we read the Batman comics forever. It's not just a tagline, it's truth. So I have to agree that I would love to see a few retrospectives on this sparking bit of social commentary. Maybe it'll get released with the next volume.

And most surprisingly, we see a 'sneak peak' into the 'up-coming' Superman/Batman ""Public Enemies. Really? Didn't that come out like two year's ago?

Despite the ball being fumbled behind the scenes, the feature it self is breath-taking, shocking, and awesome. If you've read some of my other DC reviews, you know that I always espouse a Flash or Swamp Thing, or Martian Manhunter... anything for one of the million other great characters that DC can draw upon.

Right now, the only thing I can hope for is the release date of Dark Knight Returns: Part Two.",1348531200,,1409,4.579365079365079
5180332,5,B008RV5K5E,"Is it perfect? No. That said...neither is it sugar coated or dumbed down for kid consumption. This is the brutal and brooding Batman of Miller's epic (perfectly cast with Peter Weller)that I have wanted to see on screen since 1986. I was pleasantly surprised how faithful to the source material they were. Some character design was lacking...but that is the sole criticism I can give it (other than the terrible cover art, which should have been the iconic silhouette against the lightning). I knew the guys at DC knew full well that if they fouled this up, it would be a big mistake. They also knew to get the full scope of this story, they would have to do two features. There is violence abound and, while mildly taken down a notch, it's all there. One little thing I appreciated...and I think it was fitting...there were NO OPENING TITLES. That's Timm and company saying..""you know what this is and it needs no introduction"" to me. It was definitely made with reverence for the greatest graphic novel ever put on paper.

I can only hope that part two is just as faithful, but this has given me hope that it will be all I am anticipating.

5180333,5,B008RV5K5E,"I'm a huge Batman fan. He is, without a doubt, my favorite hero in the DC pantheon. That being said, my favorite story arch is The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. I first read it about 4 or 5 years ago, and I have been hard pressed to find a better graphic novel. It's dark, emotional, and provocative. Bruce Wayne is not a nice man, and he is finally at his breaking point. I always wanted an adaptation of this graphic novel, but with some hesitation. I knew that an adaptation would be easy to mess up, so this is why I approached this film with a lot of apprehension. I am happy to report that the crew over at DC has done a bang up job of bringing my favorite Batman graphic novel to life. Peter Wellers does a fantastic job of portraying an old and grizzled Batman, and Ariel Winter is great as Robin. The animation is top-notch, and the music is amazing. All in all, this film is worthy of carrying the title of The Dark Knight Returns. I am glad that they decided to split it up into 2 parts. A 90-minute or 2 hour adaptation would have had to sacrifice many things from the graphic novel, and that would have hurt the integrity of the source material. Highly recommended to Batman fans, and highly recommended to fans of the original graphic novel. Hell, I hope they consider adapting the less-spectacular-but-still-great sequel, The Dark Knight Strikes Again.",1348531200,,1374,4.4563492063492065
5180334,3,B008RV5K5E,"The best part? I thought the sounds and music were pretty good.

On the other hand, I thought the art at times was ugly. The Mutants and their leader looked fine as where some side characters. They are in the ""spirit"" of Frank Miller's art from the comic. Other characters and scenes for that matter not so good. There were some excellent visually dramatic scenes from the comic which for the most part they failed to capture. I also didn't care for how Bruce Wayne and Robin looked.

I thought the drama and emotions of some scenes were lost. When Batman finally confronts Two-Face in the comic Harvey Dent is just not a crazy person, but a deeply damaged individual who in spite of his psychosis is pitiable. This was not conveyed well in this movie. I thought the dialogue and delivery was weak at times and I wasn't too crazy about some of the voice actors. I like Peter Weller as an actor (he's great in the ""Naked Lunch""), but he wasn't working for me as Batman and neither was the actor doing Harvey Dent. As far as Bruce Wayne's internal monologue from the comic that other reviewers have referred to, yes its a shame they couldn't include that. However, to be fair that might have been very difficult to do. Still they could have made up for some of that by having Batman talk to himself out loud a little more, because that interior dialogue from the comic really reveals much about the inside of the Batman. How he is equally damaged and obsessive as some of the criminals he chases after.

I have to say the whole effort feels a little stiff and not as natural as it could be. The comic was a classic and had an obvious influence on later Batman movies. The comic was very 1980's (culturally and time period) which in this first part they don't really place the time period well. The comic also had some fun with the culture at the time which I think so far is lost. At best this feels like a mediocre effort to bring this story to the screen and when it succeeds its more due to the source material than anything the producers have done. I hope they make a better effort in the second part movie, which doesn't bother me that it was split into 2 parts as the story is fairly long. If I were to grade it I'd give it a B-. If you are a casual Batman fan you may enjoy it more than a fan of the original comic.",1348531200,5,2320,4.280182232346242
5180335,5,B008RV5K5E,"Bruce Timm is DA MAN! He totally GETS these characters and stories. They feel completely authentic. The production values for this one in particular are stellar. The score is really great and pulls you into the story. All the voice cast are fantastic. It took a few minutes to get used to Weller's portrayal, but again it works wonderfully. By the time he gets to the line ""You don't get it son. This isn't a mud pit...."" I was practically cheering.

It would have been nice to have a couple more special features, but maybe they're saving those for part 2. I hope this is wrong, but in the peek at part 2, it says it's coming out in WINTER OF 2013! That's over a year away!

I would say this is the best DC animated film released so far, even better than Red Hood.",1348531200,,765,4.268965517241379

If you aren't familiar with the source,by all means read it and then get this. Many thanks to the people responsible for getting this done.
 Now-how long do I have to wait before part 2 is available?",1348531200,,365,4.615384615384615
5180337,5,B008RV5K5E,"It probably should be considered sacrilege to be a Batman fan and not be absolutely gaga over The Dark Knight Returns, but, strangely, I never was a giant fan of Fran Miller's grim take on Batman's future. Don't get me wrong, it's a good story, and one of the better Batman tales out there, but I never quite regarded it as definitive or superior to the many other worthwhile takes on Batman. Amazingly however, TDKR Part 1 did what very few film adaptations are ever able to do and - in many ways - improved upon and surpassed it's source material.

The changes are immediately apparent. While the film opens in the exact same way as the comic, gone is the hard boiled noir inner monologues that gave the original comic it's Sin City-esque tone, gone is the constant drone of newscasters and polipsy babbling, and in its stead is little more than the grim, dark adrenaline of Bruce Wayne pushing its racer to its limit, as a musical score that blends Hans Zimmer with John Carpenter plays quietly in the background.

The newscasters pop up soon enough - make no mistake, no story beats are missed or forgotten about - but the subtle tweaks in its presentation turns the film from a definitively noir, comic booky experience, into something even more sinister and brutal. It's still unmistakably Batman, but with it, comes the slick and eery overtones of 80s sci-fi and the ultra-violent twinge of the 80s actioneer. Being an animated film with a running time of scarcely 76 minutes, it's obviously not quite up to par with Blade Runner, and RoboCop, and the original Terminator, but it without question borrows heavily from those pieces to create a strangely iconic, strangely unique 80s futurist vision of Batman.

Which, if you've read the comic, I'm sure you'll say it's what it always has been. The source material definitely lends itself to that sub-genre that was burgeoning in Hollywood when Frank Miller first penned the comic back in 1986, but again, it's only enhanced and improved by the film crew's creative decisions and direction.

Outside of its overall presentation, the next overwhelming strength for the film, is the characterization of Batman himself. After reading the comic, I was hardly sold on the grizzled, militaristic Batman that Frank Miller made famous, but on film, and voiced phenomenally by Peter Weller (of RoboCop fame, ironically), the over the top characterization of the comic is, once again, transmuted into something much cooler, sleeker and simply exuding 80s cool and bravado.

To say that Batman is at his best - his coolest, his most violent, his most broken and intriguing - would not be a wholly incorrect statement to make. While I positively love Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman, and while I respect the detail in which Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale explored their Batman's psyche, Weller's Batman has a fierceness that both of those interpretations lacked. He is, to be blunt, a bad ass. More RoboCop, John McClaine, Snake Pliskin than the wounded soul that Keaton and Bale were.

The final striking aspect of the film, honestly has to be its direction and overall sublety of its screenwriting. During the opening act of the film, we're treated to several moments of Bruce Wayne's inner demons and his continued obsession with his parents death in several flashbacks and hallucinatory episodes that deliver that age old psychosis of Batman in possibly the most sophisticated yet troubled way I've yet seen on film.

On top of this surprisingly mature writing is a level of direction and shot selection that I've seldom seen in animated, direct-to-video filmmaking. It's balantly obvious that director Jay Olivia truly strove to make a movie that is more than just an hour-long marketing ploy. He really seemed to want to make something truly special and individual to the series of DC Animated movies; a love letter to the original work, to the action films of our collective, 80s childhoods, to Christopher Nolan's recent entries, and, of course, to the character himself.

All in all, this care, attention to detail and talent in adaptation, acting, and direction imbibes The Dark Knight Returns with a level of quality and maturity that is rarely seen in this genre of film.",1348531200,6,4237,4.92436974789916
5180338,2,B008RV5K5E,"Let me start by saying that I love, love, love ""The Dark Knight Returns"" comic. I have read it once a year since it originally came out, probably. It's an awesome piece of comic art and I have been waiting to see the animation ever since I first heard it was coming out.

That being said, I find myself hugely disappointed. One of the best things about the comic is the way Miller puts you in the heads of the chief characters. The narrative is as much internal as it is external. You get to know Batman in a way you don't often see him, from the inside.

Obviously, the director/writers didn't think the narration worked. They try to externalize all the narrative and because of this you lose the sense of the inner motivations of Batman. Worse, since so much of the narrative of the story is internal, the writers have had to write in material that doesn't exist in the comic in order to explain to the viewers what's going on. Some of it is cringe inducing.

The writers obviously didn't want to take too much liberty with the dialogue so they resort to trying to tell the story visually in between all the dialogue. The result is a slow, plodding pace. It's so plodding that I found myself bored with the whole thing.

They also took some of the edginess off of Batman. In the graphic novel, Batman is mean-spirited, crotchety and sadistic. Some of the lines that really bring this out were cut so you get a watered-down, ""safe"" Dark Knight. You can almost hear the discussions being had around some conference table somewhere about the need to keep Batman ""safe"" for kids. Somebody somewhere chickened out and decided that it wouldn't change the story if Batman were just a little nicer.

For the record, I was 12 or 13 when I first read the comic and I ate it up, sadistic Batman and all.

I liked the casting of Peter Weller as Batman. After watching ""Robocop"", I actually thought he would've made a good live-action ""Dark Knight"" back in the day. He has the jaw for it. I do wish the voice acting had been a little more emotive. It felt kind of flat.

Lastly, the music was pretty standard fare, dull and unobtrusive. It doesn't add anything.

All-in-all, it's a pretty soul-less affair. You get the feeling that the director tried to ""make it my own"" and, in the end, he did so, much to my chagrin. He removed the art and the heart. As excited as I was for Part 1 to come out, I no longer look forward to Part 2.",1348531200,8,2421,4.3763919821826285
5180339,3,B008RV5K5E,"I will start right off the bat (no pun intended) that I have never read the original adaption of the Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller, so the story in this movie is entirely new material to me. As a casual Batman fan, I have enjoyed many different stories and movies of the Batman from different decades. As far as film, I loved the Dark Knight Trilogy, Batman The Animated Series, Batman The Mask of the Phantasm and the latest DC Animated film Batman: Under the Red Hood, which was one of the BEST animated Batman films I've seen in a while. I've heard universally that ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is one of the (if not THE) greatest batman story ever written, so making an animated film based on that story should not be surprising, but again I have never read the graphic novel so I can't compare and contrast between the film and novel. I am here merely to critique THIS film, and personally I wasn't as impressed as I was hoping to be. The Dark Knight Returns is part 1 of 2 movies of the great novel, and part 1 was a decent experience. I found the story to be quite intriguing from beginning to end and seeing what the characters such as Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon have been up to. Bruce Wayne has retired from the cape and cowl for about 10 years and in that time Gotham City has turned into a living hell, where the city has been overrun by a group of criminals called the Mutants committing all sorts of murders like it was nothing. Even crimes such as prostitution and molestation are shown in the movie, and I gotta say this is probably the darkest Batman film I've ever seen. I like the theme of the story, but the pace was very very bad. I feel that this movie could've easily been a 2 hour movie if done correctly, because the events in this movie do not flow as well as other movies with a 75 minute time limit do. I felt the movie was a bit rushed, especially in the beginning of the film. I don't know if the Novel depicted the story like this, but there was just too much going on that it was hard to follow for the first 10-20 minutes or so. Back stories of the Mutants was very vague; they didn't touch upon how the Mutants were established in the first place, especially the leader. The mutants purpose are simple, they follow the leader's orders because he is the biggest and strongest of the city, so naturally he takes over Gotham and corrupts the young and ignorant minds while the Batman is absent. It bothers me that this amount of violence has been occurrinng for so long, and it takes this this long for Bruce Wayne to come back, but once he does come back it's great.

The voice acting was my primary hatred for the film. A lot of the voice acting lacked real human emotions or any urgency. I would say I liked about half of the voice acting, Peter Weller (Robocop) was decent as an older Bruce Wayne, but I felt that Kevin Conroy would've done a much better job if he reprised his role as THE voice acting Bat. Commisioner Gordan sounded whiny, but halfway through the movie his voice grew on me. The mutant's leader sounds like a generic villain thug you would expect to hear from any cartoon today. The Mutant Gang themselves sounded like punk kids, which they are, so it didn't bother me as much. The Newscasters were one of the voices that I completely despised, but I acknowledged their purpose. Some of the newscasters were sarcastic and implied some humor, but none of it connected with me. The voices I HATED THE MOST would have to be the voice of female Robin and the voice of the Joker (even though his appearance was short). I really wished Mark Hamill would have returned to do Joker, or even at least John DiMaggio from Under the Red Hood, but this new guy doesn't capture the menacing and twisted Joker I have grown to love. Ariel Winter as Robin....okay I guess my hatred for the character is deeper than just the voice, I guess I just hate everything about the character. I am not sexist in any way, I have no problem with Robin being a girl, but the way they portrayed her in the movie couldn't possibly be any worse. Her motivation to become Robin was forced terribly, there was no point in the movie where she expressed any interest in becoming Robin or helping innocent people, she kind of just became Robin on a whim. The scenario she was in during the film was she and a friend were jumped by the Mutants during the middle of the night, and Batman just so happened to be there and save them, however I didn't sense any urge to fight from Carrie's character during that moment, she just sorta stood there. So I guess she just got inspired to become Robin from there on after seeing what Batman did? Does it sound Stupid? Yes. In that logic, practically ANY KID saved from Batman can become Robin if they wanted to, and in this fictional world, I'm pretty sure there are plenty of Kids that have FAR more potential to become the next Robin. But allow me to continue...During the film, when she was transitioning to become Robin, she was jumping from building to building doing flips and complex aerial movements without any proper training or any background information that hinted she had the ability to do such things in the first place. Dick Grayson (the first Robin) was a gifted gymnast in the circus, Jason Todd (the 2nd Robin) was trained FIRST by Bruce Wayne himself so the physics of their abilities were justified, but Carrie Kelley was just RANDOM. If her character was better in the graphic novel, than I guess the producers just did a BAD job portraying her character in this movie.

I have to give credit to the animation. I am not a big fan of American animation, especially DC's animation. Most of their films are so bland with barely any attention to details to characters or environment. While some of their flaws are still present in this movie, such as texture less buildings, I have to say that their animation team did a far better job with this film. Most of Batman's movements are smooth and believable, while some (punching through hard concrete and jumping from 10 story buildings without being hurt) leave a lot to be desired. The fight scenes are good for the most part, once again, if Batman has the ability to punch through concrete with ease, I don't see why it was so difficult to defeat ONE oversized mutant. I appreciated that they choreographed the fights  well, and Batman literally breaks every bone possible to someone at one point which was pretty awesome to watch.

I don't know what is going to happen in Part 2, but I hope the writers and producers do a better job with the voice acting and pacing in the next movie. I still enjoyed Part 1 despite it's many many flaws, but if Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns is labeled as the greatest Batman story ever written, than this movie did a horrible job of convincing me. I have to wait for Part 2 to give my full opinion on that statement.",1348531200,2,6896,4.436119873817034
5180340,5,B008RV5K5E,"Ten years after Batman has retired, and Gotham City has sunk deeper into lawlessness; the Batman returns to aid Gotham city in its' need. Joined by Carrie Kelly, a young female Robin, Batman takes to the streets to end the threat of the mutant gangs that have overrun the city. After facing off against his two greatest enemies, the Joker and Two-Face, for the final time, Batman finds himself in mortal combat with his former ally, Superman, in a battle that only one of them will survive.

I'll admit, I was a little displeased with Batman: Year One. What worked so well for the ""Year One"" comic was exactly what didn't work for the animated feature. Even though it was faithful to Frank Miller's work, something about it was just amiss. Still, I purchased it and added it to my collection. Yes, I recommend it to everyone as well but I wasn't completely happy with it. Which brings me to the new Warner Premiere/DC Universe animated feature, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1. I must admit, this is one time that Bruce Timm and Co. got it all right. This adaptation completely nails the tone and atmosphere of the book. What amazes me is how they don't shy away from the explicit themes from the comic book, like Rape, Murdering Children and the like. Course, if you'll notice from most of the Warner Premiere animated features, things aren't too explicit yet they do deal with more adult themes. This particular tale reminded me of the Spawn Animated series to a certain extent, in utilizing the shadows and darkness to create a very ambient and dark tone. Peter Weller & Ariel Winter do a great job as The Dark Knight and his sidekick, Robin.

I like how Warner Premiere and DC Comics keep bringing animated versions of DC's greatest works and I hope that they continue the trend. Marvel seems too content in spawning original tales with their animated features, which is fine. They hadn't missed a beat, if truth be known. I hadn't seen any other DC animated feature that has successfully captured the atmosphere and themes of its original work than this one has. I'm quite impressed and look forward to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 2 next year.",1348531200,4,2166,4.667539267015707
5180341,4,B008RV5K5E,"Dc has been making animated films for a few years now. It was inevitable that they make the book that started it all - the new trend in comic books. Dark and gritty truly did start with ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns."" The question is, though, how closely will they follow the source material?
I will affirm that they did very closely.
Of course there are a few bits of ""artisitc embellishment"" and some bits of dialogue added or changed in this version. That's to be expected because the graphic novel was a lot coarser in the language department, and some of the violence was quite a bit harder than audiences today could handle.
If folks have read the book, this first film folllows the first two issues - both one shot stories leading into the next which, in turn, lead into the epic parts 3 and 4. Epic is allowable in this case.
Without giving away much of the story which needs to be watched and not described:
Part one - Harvey Dent has been released, completely cured and pretty thanks to modern medicine. Bruce Wayne is fighting regret and boredom with crazy, near-suicidal stunts. Crime is at an all-time high. What is a 50's-plus former superhero to do? Return to the old ways - beat the crap out of bad guys and get the the root of the problem. That he does. With a vengeance.
Next is the whole mutant MAIN storyline that makes up part two. They are the problems. Batman does what he does best. Dark and sinister vs. the wild and insane. The mutants rule Gotham and citizens live in fear. After taking down Two-Face, the Mutants are now in the Batman's crosshairs. Not a good place to be in, trust me.
The story as a whole fits the original work of Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley as if they had a direct hand in the animated version. The animation is crisp and matches the books panel for panel. Splash page art from the books IS used in the movie, but are very brief shots so catching it is almost like subliminal advertising, you see it and recognise it, so it's there, just blink and you've missed it. Thank goodness for freeze framing.
The voice casting I will say is NOT stellar. Jim Gordon's character doesn't have that ""seasoned"" feel to his voice. He sounds too young nd spry for a man whose seen more than his share of depravity and crime by dedicating his life to fighting said crime. The character felt rather flat and lifeless. Same for Alfred Pennyworth, the famed butler and confidante to Bruce Wayne. His lines were excellent and added a lightness to the story, but again, he didn't sound his age.
On the plus side, Batman, Carrie Kelly, Capt. Yindell, and a few others more than made up the one-dimensional portrayals of other characters. So the balance was there, even though some more work was needed here.
Now my favorite part of any film, the score. When first watching the menu screen, the music here gave that feel of ""Hold on to your seat, it's going to get wild."" feel. It has a very, for lack of a better term, ""blockbuster film"" feel to it. It held a grand scale ambiance with overtones of ""it's in the dark and it's going to get you if you're naughty."" Seriously, it's that good.
This is one to get, boys and girls. While it holds the same feel and grit, it is a little toned down from the original work for the sake of getting a PG-13 rating. Don't wait, by all means, pick this up and see how DC revolutionised the comic book industry with ""Batman: The Dark Knight Returns part One.""",1348531200,7,3440,4.436018957345971
5180342,4,B008RV5K5E,"I enjoy DC/Warner comic adaptations, having seen pretty much all of them.  Also, I understand why some screen writers change small aspects of the story, such as when Dwayne McDuffie changed aspects of the Justice League series that JL: Doom was based on; for example, he changed the specific types of traps Batman had designed for the leaguers, etc. Obviously, this was done to flesh out what was really a very short story within a greater JL tale.  However, I do not understand Bob Goodman's decision to change specific dialog within, in my opinion, the greatest comic written to date.  For instance, the news casters were admirably done, but the fact that there is no mention of the government censorship that they are under is a HUGE gaffe, which undermines the entire reason for the major clash that will occur in the final episode.  Also, certain subtleties in the story-telling were overlooked, such as the last line between the Batman and Harvey Dent: what in God's name is the point of changing that pivotal line?  It's as bad was when they took out the ski scene in Batman: Year One.  Did Mr. Goodman think he was going to receive a poor grade for plagiarism?  That line was supposed to convey that Batman understands that he's as much a victim of his obsession as Dent, that the line between good and evil isn't as wide as we'd like to think.  That our Heroes can easily become villains if the circumstances change.  As other reviewers have noted, it's the nuances of the story-telling that have been left out.  Certainly, the creators all paid the correct amount of reverence to the tale after all it was the pivotal comic of the 80's, bar none.  (Yes, I realize the Watchmen came out at the same time, but I'd argue with anyone that the Watchmen was helped tremendously by the popularity of this particular Batman tale, which took everyone in comics by storm).  Anyway, I digress.  I wish that Bruce Timm, whose work I appreciate, had made certain to comb over the details of the writing so that we could have a 5 star film like Batman: Under the Red Hood.  Still and all, I gave the film 4 stars because it's Miller's Batman, and it doesn't get better than this...(just ask Christopher Nolan!)",1348531200,3,2206,4.637532133676093
5180343,5,B008RV5K5E,"I just finished watching ""The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1"" and I give it an enthusiastic thumbs up. Given Bruce Timm's recent work, which I have not enjoyed, I was leary about this one. I haven't been a huge fan of Batman animation since the 90s, excepting ""Under the Red Hood"". But having him as producer, Jay Oliva as director (who did Iron Man and Dr. Strange, two of my favorite of the Marvel animations), and Andrea Romano back in voice direction (from the 90s Batman animated series), it all worked out.

I'm always concerned when watching animation if the voice actors are someone I know well from live action. Will I be able to separate their voice from their face and buy their performance in the animation? I'll admit, I started this movie having trouble doing that with Gordon (David Selby of Dark Shadows) and Batman/Wayne (Peter Weller of Robocop). As it went on though, I got into it and really took to them in their roles. My only reservation, and it is the same with virtually every non-Kevin Conroy performance of Batman, is that actors playing Batman often neglect to make separate voices for Batman and Bruce Wayne. In the comics, Bruce wants to keep Batman's persona separate and doing the voice is one of the most important features of that. My only problem with Weller's performance is that he uses the same voice for Batman as for Wayne. It put me off a little, as it always does.

I like that this movie moved away from the graphic novel in spots, adding and subtracting scenes and dialogue according to what worked for the movie instead of just staying slavishly true to the novel. My big problem with the movie adaptation of ""Batman: Year One"" was that it stayed too close to the novel and what worked in the comic book medium didn't translate as well into the animated movie version. With ""DK Returns"", the filmakers negotiate their way through this problem with grace, making sure that you know you aren't just watching a motion comic. This is an adaptation as much as the word can imply, staying as true as it needs to the source material while trying to be its own thing. Even knowing what was going to happen, I was still in suspense at all the right spots, particularly during the first fight between Batman and the Mutant Leader. Waiting for Robin to intervene had me on the edge of my seat and I think it was well done.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of darker takes on Batman's character, a la Frank Miller. I also believe this movie would appeal to anyone who was a fan of ""Batman: The Animated Series"" given Timm's and Romano's roles in making this movie.

Side note: The funny thing about watching this is that now that it is in film format, I feel like I'm watching an abridged version of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" which took much of its material from this novel. It is neat to make comparisons on how the source material was used for each and how it applies to each version of the Batman universe.

Anyhow, I'm now really looking forward to the 2nd part. I'll buy it once both parts are available, just in case they do a special edition which combines both films into one. You know WB, they double-dip every franchise they can.",1348531200,5,3181,4.506065857885615

Ever since the Batman Animated series, whenever I read a Batman comic, I can only hear one voice. To me Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of Batman.  I'm not sure why he hasn't been utilized in a lot of these DC comic movies or in the Young Justice series.  Every recent animation has me saying ""It would be better with Kevin Conroy!""  I tried not to let this get to me, but this Batman sounds a lot like Bane in the new Batman movie.  That or Billy Zane holding in a huge dump!

Let me start with the positives!  DC animated movies always have stellar animation.  This is no exception.  They mimic the comic style of the source material perfectly.  It was exhilarating seeing Frank Miller's pencils come to life.  The art is definately the high point.  The script does a very good job adapting the comic.  There are extra scenes and it is out of order a little from the comic, but all in all it was very good.

This movie left me excited for the conclusion!  I'm glad they did it justice and spread it over 2 movies so they can cover everything.  This is a great way to introduce people to The Dark Knight Returns and hopefully they go and read the comics.  His Batman Year One was integral to the recent Batman Movies.  300 and Sin City movies were incredibly well done and it was all due to staying true to the source material.  This is a lesson all movie makers need to take note of.  Just use the source material and don't ""Michael Bay"" your movie!  This is something this movie should have done.

Something started bothering me half way through and I couldn't put my finger on it.  It was only until my girlfriend start asking me: ""why would Batman do this or that? ""What is he thinking?"" ""What does that mean?"" that it hit me.  There was no patented Frank Miller inner monlogue in the script!  I have read the comic hundreds of times and I think because of this, I was correcting it on my own.  The Sin City movie nailed it, this movie ignored it.

This is as close to having a movie adaptation you are ever going to see, it's just to bad that they screwed up on something so crucial.  If you can ignore the bad voice acting for Batman and forgive the lack of inner monologue (or fill it in yourself) this is definately worth checking out!  Since so much is dead on and not all the voice acting is bad, I still give it a 4/5!",1348444800,2,2571,4.226337448559671
5180348,5,B008RV5K5E,"One of the reasons I've enjoyed Batman over the years is because, well, he's human.  This movie shows just how human Batman is because he's aged just like all of us will eventually, which means he's slowed down and he's not as strong, and he recognizes this; but he is still mentally sharp.  Batman's age is brought up more than once in the movie, but he has more than enough will and smarts to get the job done.

5180351,5,B008RV5K5E,"First, before I review this film; people reviewing this film and giving it poor reviews are reviewing the wrong product or know nothing about what they purchased. One person is reviewing The Dark Knight Rises and another is upset because he expected something relating to Nolan's films and is declaring this a rip off.  I find those kind if irresponsible, uninformed reviews infuriating. Know what you are reviewing people. This is not Nolan Christopher's The Dark Knight Returns. The title is not a rip off of Nolan's films.  This film is based off one of the most influential Batman comics of all time. Nolan's films and titles are partially based off the 1986 comic book by Frank Miller which this film is depicting. In reality, had The Dark Knight Returns never been written there wouldn't be the Nolan films you see in the theater today.  Miller changed Batman from the campy hero of the 60s into the brooding angry man Burto and Nolan depict. I am not going to go over the plot. For those unfamilar with the story a simple wikipedia will suffice.

 The Review: This film is excellent. I read the graphic novel about 9 years ago during the summer of 2003.  Although there are a few (positive) changes that lengthen the story, they are consistent so that Frank Miller himself might have written them. There are no serious changes. Everything you know that happens still happens.  The animation is amazing. I wish all cartoons had animation this good. It also has a very 80s feel to it, almost Cyberpunk without the cybernetics (if that makes sense).  Grimey. Dark. Corrupt. Horrible violence everywhere once you set foot in the city. Basically the future the way science fiction writers (and many criminal justice professionals) at the time were depicting the future to be.  The only cons were the voices.  I am a fan of the 1990s animated series. I think the voices were perfect.  Although not as good as Kevin Conroy, Peter Weller does a good job but takes some getting used to. The only voice I do not like is Comissioner Gordon's. He has a slightly whiney sound.  But this isn't a serious detraction from what is otherwise a masterpiece.  I will definately be purchasing this film.",1348185600,6,2189,4.744063324538258

If you had asked me what comic I most wanted to see adapted into The DC Animated Universe, it would have been without question ""The Dark Knight Returns."" Now finally, close to thirty years after its publication, I finally get my wish.

And it is ... disappointing.

""The Dark Knight Returns"" is one of the greatest American comics ever published. That isn't idle praise. Frank Miller tapped deep into the collective unconsciousness to deliver a myth that continues to be an influence to this day. It is an incredible work of art. And DC had to have known that they needed to treat the story with a little more reverie. I am actually confused at how it got such a poor treatment. There are so many problems with this release, from the main film to the bonus features.

First off, and most obvious, is the decision to split the film into two parts. There is nothing behind that but money. DC knows they have a hot property on their hands, so they want to sell it to you twice. But, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is still only a 4-issue comic, only slightly longer than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-Year-One/dp/B005I5C654/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman: Year One</a>&nbsp;which was adapted to a single film. In order to justify the two-parter, they pad the story. Every scene of dialog is stretched just a little bit further. All of the conversations have just a few more lines thrown in, a few more long pauses. Not only is this awkward, but it completely throws off the pacing of the story. The scene with Commissioner Gordon and Bruce Wayne sharing a drink occupies half a page in the comic, but here it is stretched out into minutes of dialog. And not good dialog. Boring dialog.

And the bizarre thing is, they cut out much of the actual great dialog already in the comic--or monologue in this case. All of Bruce Wayne's internal monologue, the very thing that drives the story, that gives depth and meaning to the dystopian landscape, that makes ""The Dark Knight Returns"" rise above, has been removed. All of his comments on his body, on the weight of age--gone. That famous scene where he does the back-kick? ""There are seven working defenses from this position. Three of them disarm with minimal contact. Three of them kill. One of them ... hurts."" Yeah, we still get that scene, but without the play-by-play. Just Batman kicking the guy behind him.

I really don't understand how that decision could have been made. Was there a meeting? Did someone propose ""Hey! You know all of that great, famous monologue in ""The Dark Knight Returns? "" The stuff everyone quotes when they talk about the book? Why don't we just nix that and write a few more scenes of Wayne and Gordon having drinks?""

Seriously ...

And the voice acting. I had the same problem with ""Batman: Year One,"" which looked great but just didn't have strong voice actors. Peter Weller does Batman, and I think he pulls it off well. Everyone else though ... Ariel Winter doing Carrie Kelly just doesn't sound right. She sounds like a pampered rich kid, with no edge or spirit. And all of the other voices; I know Miller put in some dialog that is hard to pull off. The Mutant-speak isn't exactly normal English. But these actors sound like a bunch of frat guys doing a parody of ""gangster talk."" It sounds so forced and fake, like they don't believe a word they are saying. When a killer steps up behind you and says ""I need you mommie. Make me feel safe."" it should send a chill down my spine, not a chuckle.

Art and animation-wise, things look decent. They didn't try to imitate Miller's style at all, but I am OK with that. I think they could have been more creative with the television cut-scenes, and more moody with their use of shadows, as well as making better use of some of the visual impact of the comic. Gone is the iconic scene of Batman holding the flag-covered corpse of the General. Gone is the scene towards the end of Harvey Dent's face ""matching."" But all in all, the animation is solid, and if this were just a regular Batman animated show I would give it full marks.

Now the bonus features (and I am talking about the Blu-Ray here). This is another ""What were they thinking?"" moment for me. There is almost nothing here about ""The Dark Knight Returns."" The Carried Kelly feature is cool, talking about a female Robin. But where is the ""Frank Miller and Batman"" featurette? Where is the ""1986: The Year that Changed Comics"" short? Or something like that. Something to show the impact and gravity of the comic they are adapting. Instead there is an (admittedly interesting) piece on ""Batman and Me: The Bob Kane Story."" What? Bob Kane? Umm, that's cool and all, but Bob Kane had nothing to do with this.

I have the 25th Anniversary leather-bound edition of ""The Dark Knight Returns,""  and it is filled with newspaper articles and stories about the impact the comic had, the firestorm of press it created, how it directly lead to the creation of Tim Burton's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;film. There is a wealth of material available. I am always amazed at how little effort DC spends on these bonus features to lead people back to the source comics. It's like they don't want to acknowledge Miller's contribution at all, or how this single comic revolutionized the industry. Maybe they are scared of leading people to the original ""Dark Knight Returns""  because then they will see what a poor adaptation this is.

Instead we get ""The Bob Kane Story."" Which again, is admittedly cool. It's funny how all of these comics professionals try to tip-toe around the truth, and bite their tongues to keep from shouting out ""Bob Kane was a jerk!"" It's even funnier than not all of them succeed. And to hear Stan Lee call someone an egotistical, self-promoting gasbag without even a trace of irony is hilarious. But still, this is ""The Dark Knight Returns.""  I want to hear about Frank Miller.  I want to hear about THIS comic.

And the two ""Batman: The Animated Series"" episodes included: They are about Two-Face. That's cool. But why not ""Legends of the Dark Knight""  from ""Batman: The Animated Series"" or ""The Battle of the Superheroes""  from ""Brave and the Bold"" that featured scenes from ""Dark Knight Returns?"" I don't get it. Even the cover of this DVD.  Why didn't they use the famous cover from the comic? Sigh ...

Am I getting Part 2? Of course I am getting Part 2. Am I going to be disappointed? Yes.  That seems to be par for the course nowadays.",1348185600,88,7269,5.179880647911339

5180354,4,B008RV5K5E,"Managed to preview this latest installment of the Batman animated features prior to its official DVD release, and again we find a story based on a classic DC graphic novel... yet not just any graphic novel, but the one which was the first step in breathing fresh new life into the Batman franchise when the character and his surrounding mythology were hemorrhaging and trying to remain relevant for a new generation of comic book fans as well as for American moviegoers whose only experience with the Batman was a campy television show from the 1960s.

""THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS"" translates the original DC graphic novel by Frank Miller over to the ""animation"" realm and does quite a successful job at remaining faithful to the original source material, which is certain to be a huge plus for the many hardcore ""purists"" who were enthralled with Miller's ""non-continuity"" imagination piece.

However, this rendition of the story does (in my opinion) have two very serious flaws:

The first flaw is the ""artwork."" The drawn characters are not smooth, flowing and graceful, but rather rough, bulky and clumsy. Of course, this is supposed to be ""deliberate"" on the animators' part, as they are clearly attempting to mimic the pencil art style of Miller's original drawings... but what works well within the ""printed pages"" feels extremely awkward when making the transition to animated video. So while the story itself keeps us engrossed, the ""visual"" style always manages to keep us slightly off-kilter.

The second and biggest flaw is the garsh-horrible Voice-Directing and Voice-Acting. Peter Weller (""ROBOCOP"") supplying the voice for Bruce Wayne [slash] Batman does almost nothing to rescue the vocal performances! The way the voice actors deliver their lines of dialog are so nerve-gratingly amateurish that it sounds like a stage production being performed by any typical Junior-High School drama club. Even with the awkward & foreign colloquialisms of this ""fantasy future world,"" there's really no excuse for such wooden & stilted (and utterly ""EXPRESSIONLESS"") line delivery: it is as if this particular band of actors really did not care about their work, but were instead merely stepping up in front of a microphone for no other purpose than to draw a paycheck just so they could cover their next rent & utilities payments.

These demerits aside however, the fact that the story and the very concept of The Batman ""rising"" out of retirement (if you'll pardon the pun) is enough to keep the viewer totally involved speaks well of it as a solid ""package,"" and DC is to be commended for finally bringing this top fave of fanboys everywhere to join the ranks of so many other impressive ""DCAU"" features, and it stokes the flames of anticipation for the as yet unreleased ""Part 2"" in this saga.",1347926400,,2797,5.019396551724138
5180355,3,B008RV5K5E,"Let me preface this review by saying that I read the original graphic novel series many years ago. I understand that such a work as done by Frank Miller could be difficult to translate into an animated film simply because of the nature in which it was written and the way in which the artwork was constructed. All in all, while I did feel some disappointment with this film, I did find it to be an entertaining re-telling of Frank Miller's original work. It seemed to hold the proper tone that Miller was trying to capture in that an aging Batman has to contend with a society that no longer wants his presence as well as his age handicapping his abilities.

One thing that did bother me was the lack of ""voice-over"" narration by Batman as seen in the graphic novel. While the lack of this narration did not detract from the film and it's impact, I think there would have been an even stronger impact upon viewers if we could hear those intimate, calculating, emotional thoughts that Batman had during each encounter. A perfect example is when he first comes back onto the scene and is climbing a rope to reach the bad guys. One bad guy says that Batman has to be old by now. In response to this, the Batman voice-over says, ""Old enough to need to use my legs to climb a rope"". This occurs in the comics, not the film, but I think it really allows the audience a peek into the mindframe and mindset of Batman while he engages in his crime-fighting activities. As I said, it is not a mood-killer that it was left out of the film, but I do think the creative team behind the film kind of missed out on a very good opportunity to really suck the audience of the film into the mind of Batman.

Another thing that bothered me was the voice casting for Batman/Bruce Wayne. Yes, Peter Weller did a fine job with this, and I give him his due credit for giving life to an aging Batman. I also understand why the creative team might have wanted to not utilize the legendary Kevin Conroy (the one and only true voice for Batman from the animated series of the 90's, the Justice League animated series, the animated movie between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and the Arkham video games) for the voice in an effort to open up people's minds to the concept of more than one person being able to bring Batman to life. Unfortunately, I feel like the creative team missed the boat a bit on this one. For anyone who ever watched the animated series from the 90's, you may recall that they did a storytelling episode that actually made use of Frank Miller's graphic novel. In specific, they showed a scene that blended Batman's initial attack against the Mutants with his final fight against the Mutant's leader in which he utter's the infamous expression, ""This isn't a trash heap, it's an operating table, and I'm the suregon."" In this instance, the creative team behind the animated series made, in my opinion, an absolutely genius decision to utilize Michael Ironside (""Jester"" from the film Top Gun) as the voice of Batman. I really and truly wish the team behind the Dark Knight Returns movie had decided to retain his voice or, if they had indeed tried to go that route, that Mr. Ironside had accepted any offer to do said voice for this film. While Peter Weller certainly exemplified the cold and dark visage of Batman, Michael Ironside, in just a ten minute clip, truly seemed to epitomize the dark, gritty, dangerousness of a Batman who, while having grown older, has also become a lot more calculating and deadly with his experiences. It was a truly missed opportunity.

Overall, I was generally happy with the film and look forward to seeing how they put the rest of Miller's story into film in part 2, particularly the verbal back and forth and eventual combat between Batman and Superman.",1347840000,19,3789,4.528467153284671
5180356,5,B008RV5K5E,"For those who think the dark knight started a few years ago,

Batman is a fictional character, a comic book superhero created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. The character first appeared in Detective Comics #27 (May 1939), and since then has appeared primarily in publications by DC Comics. Originally referred to as ""The Bat-Man"" and still referred to at times as ""The Batman"", he is additionally known as ""The Caped Crusader"",[2] ""The Dark Knight"",[2] and ""The World's Greatest Detective,""[2] among other titles.

Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is a four-issue comic book limited series comprising The Dark Knight Returns, The Dark Knight Triumphant, Hunt The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Falls, written and drawn by Frank Miller, originally published by DC Comics under the title Batman: The Dark Knight in 1986. When the issues were released in a collected edition later that year, the story title for the first issue was applied to the series as a whole. The Dark Knight Returns tells the story of a 55-year-old Bruce Wayne who comes out of retirement to fight crime, only to face opposition from the Gotham City police force and the United States government.

5180358,1,B008RV5K5E,"First, let me preface this by stating that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I loved The Dark Knight, Inception, and pretty much everything he has done...until now. I thought this film was entirely too long and stretched out. Even Christian Bale seemed like he was bored to tears for most of the movie. Instead of having him be out for vengeance after Rachel's death Nolan decides to have him retire? Um, no. That's not how Batman would react. You're thinking of Edward Cullen, Mr. Nolan. Anyway after that it's nothing but teleporting Bruce Wayne, heavy handed plot points, and a villain who sounds like he's doing a Sean Connery impression through a wrapping paper tube. You want to know what else was ridiculous? The freaking bomb that is supposed to blow up Gotham. First, it's some green energy crap but it has a timer on it for some reason. Second, why did Bane wait six FREAKING months to have it blow up? Yea, sure, he said it was to torture Bruce Wayne. Whatever, if you accept that logic then thats your problem. If Nolan had cut all of that out though this would have been a much stronger film. No magical back healing. No magic teleporting back to Gotham. No long drawn out scenes where he tries to climb some stupid wall (i get that it was supposed to be some turning point for bruce wayne but it took up like 30 minutes in a movie that was already way too long). I could keep going but im going to stop here and say it is tragic that Nolan followed up the modern day masterpiece that is the Dark Knight with this crap. I expect more from you Chris.",1347580800,2,1563,4.374570446735395
5180359,5,B008RV5K5E,"I own this blu-ray. Not sure how I got it delivered early from another company but I did and I can tell you that this is the finest Batman film ever made. It is up there with Batman Mast Of The Phantasm.

As a life long fan of Frank Millers Graphic Novel I was excited to see this following Batman Year One which also served the source proud.

There are a few differences from the source. Most notably, Millers trademark voice over narrative of Batman is gone. In the comic we really got into Bruce's head and Batman's. The good news is that I did not really notice this until I got my novel out after viewing. This does not detract from the great story. Another difference is the scene with the general who supplies the Mutants with weapons. There is an additional scene where Batman confronts the general rather than finding him dead.

The film finishes in a perfect place with the fight with the mutant with the incredible line ""...this is an operating table and I'm the surgeon.""

The voice talent is top notch. I'm a Kevin Conroy fan but Peter 'Robocop' Weller does a great job and its good to hear and see Batman and he truly belongs in the animated universe. The problem with Nolan's live action films is that they are great crime dramas but everytime Batman is on the screen it is embarrassing. It is a man in a suit with a stupid voice. It never worked for me.

This animation however, is a great experience and I cannot wait for part 2.

Extras on the blu-ray include a sneak peek at part 2, a couple of episodes from the animated series (Two Face) and a series of trailers.

5180360,3,B008RV5K5E,"Ok so this is the plot and story line of TDKR, but it does not have the power of the graphic novel. I recall reading TDKR in the 80s and it redefined Batman, telling a story that is both political and fantastical. By talking away the inner monologue, we do not get inside the old man that Bruce has become, nor do we feel the menacing on coming storm that the mutants are.

Miller pushed the Batman myth and it was almost as if Batman pushed back, not wanting to become the character Miller was creating and between this push we got to read a remarkable story.

And here is where the animated version falls flat, we must not push beyond what DC/Warner are doing with Batman now. So we get a watered down version of TDKR. I cannot wait to see how the SM moment of Cat Women dress as Wonder Women bound up by the Joker plays out.",1347494400,5,827,4.1625
5180361,4,B008RV5K5E,"I usually go into DC movie translations with the little to no expectations of matching their source material. That being said, if you never read Dark Knight Returns, you may be fortunate enough to enjoy this movie as much as I did. It was much better than most of their offerings, and I feel as though the average joe and new fans alike will enjoy another telling of The Batman, even if it's only to hold them over until they can buy the live action movie from the Nolanverse.

In short: I think they set a nice tone throughout, the voice acting is solid, and the soundtrack has a nice edge that helps to add tension to the movie.

Anyway, Bats is old. It's several years into the future and a gang of mutants have taken over the city. After much thought and several nightmares, Bruce Wayne decides to put the cowl back on, and go after these criminals. He takes a side step to handle a plastic surgery ""fixed"" Harvey Dent then takes on the mutants leader one on one. He also awakens an old nemesis in the process and sets the movie up for its sequel.

THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS TRILOGY WAS THE FIRST MOVIE.  OHYEAH LETS TALK ABOUT HOW THE AVENGERS AND SPIDERMAN  KICKED THE CRAP OUT OF THIS MOVIE TO.  A VERY DISAPOINTED FAN.",1347408000,4,510,4.01

It currently has a 4.4 average rating and I usually like the movies that are highly rated on amazon but this one just didn't do it for me. This movie didn't really feel like a batman movie, everything and everyone was totally out of character. Fight scenes were alright but other that that I can't think of much positive about this movie. Story wasn't very compelling and character development wasn't good enough or rushed in most cases. I'm bummed I spent three dollars to rent this (on youtube),",1520899200,,557,4.58
8530100,5,B008RV5K5E,"I can only say this was a great Batman film, I purchased it and watched it over and over because it was so good. Well done Batman. The great Batman returns after so many years of retirement was fantastic and Peter Weller was the perfect voice for this story line as much as I am a fan of Kevin Conroy, this Batman was what I wanted this Batman to be.
great movie this was a whole production in itself.",1520812800,,401,4.0886075949367084

8530104,5,B008RV5K5E,"It's Dark Knight Returns. Its faithful to the comic. Therefore it is perfect. The BEST Batman film ever made. So much to love. Christopher Drakes score rivals even the best live action cinematic Batman scores. I love the 80's, John Carpenter-y synth feel of it. And Robocop voicing Batman? Couldn't be more perfect. I'll also throw in my review for part 2 because, really, it's one movie.

Part two does what I never thought could be possible - it improves on the comic. Only in a small, personal way for me. The scene at the end (in case anyone hasn't read or watched Dark Knight Returns I won't spoil what and where) with Clark and Jim Gordon. The writers added a very small dialogue between them that basically encapsulates their relationship with Bruce and Batman that isn't in the original comic and it brought a tear to my eye. Batman's relationship with Jim Gordon and Superman has always been my way into the Batman story. Such contrasts. And this line, holy crap. I wish Frank Miller would just add an extra panel in a reprinted version of the book with just that line in it. Amazing.",1498089600,,1093,4.576530612244898

AFTER WATCHING THIS USING WIFI, I LOOKED FOR THE MUSIC DISC FOR THIS TITLE AND I SEE I CAN MAKE ONE FOR IT SINCE THERE ISN'T ONE. I HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A DISC AND CREATE A DISC CASE COVER FOR THE UNRECORDED MUSIC TRACK DISC TO PLAY THE MUSIC THAT IS ON THE SOUNDTRACK OF DC COMICS BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS: PART 1. I LIKED THE TRAILER PREVIEW VIDEO THAT IS ON THE WEBSITE IMDB.COM AND I GOT INTERESTED IN THESE CARTOON ANIMATED MOVIES AGAIN TO SEE IF ANYONE DID ROBIN AS A WOMAN.
