7131589,3,B00WFHU2LS,this movie was okay. it would of been better if the sound quality did not suck. the story was good  the acting was good but it was just the sound it either was too quit at some times then really loud. i would of given it five if it was not for the poor sound quality. if you have not seen this movie i recommend that you do or do not. it's worth checking out but if you want good sound than don't see this movie,1443571200,2,411,3.7790697674418605
7131590,5,B00WFHU2LS,"Full of horror movie OG'd (Original Ghouls) like Tony Moran, Michael Berryman and Tony Todd too for some reason. It's pretty moody and cool and trus to type. Follows the ""Kill a teenager, tell a joke"" formula but had it's dark and definetly gruesome moments too.

7131591,1,B00WFHU2LS,The video preview looks about as stupid as it can possibly get...there's no way I would spend my money on this! SERIOUSLY??? LOL,1442534400,,128,4.608695652173913
7131592,1,B00WFHU2LS,"Terrible movie. Not scary, Hardly any plot, and the killer sucks. You would think for a guy in a pumpkin mask, they could give it a little more effort to be scary. If I could give BEG zero stars I would.",1441843200,3,203,3.975609756097561

8713155,1,B00WFHU2LS,BLAH is a good word for the plot of this movie!!! The writing is boring and the director has no clue what he is doing!  If it weren't for the casting including Tony Moran and Tony Todd...it wouldn't even be with mentioning! The only scare here is it made it to DVD!,1467590400,,265,4.096153846153846
8713156,4,B00WFHU2LS,"Raw and gritty, this film brings back the richness of horror in a way that reminds us of what drew people to the genre in the first place.

BEG follows the path of law enforcement that's try to figure out why murders are taking place in their small town. The area is steeped in urban legends of past horrors that the locals jokingly blame for the events. But no one knows who is committing, what seem like, random murders. More and more victims are taken, leaving only more questions...

There's some amazing imagery in the film. Watching it you're pleasantly surprised by the darkness through visuals as well as through the story line. You'll want to pop some popcorn, turn out the lights, curl up on the couch with your significant other, and remember what date night at home is all about while you watch BEG.",1466294400,,811,4.5479452054794525

8713160,1,B00WFHU2LS,"Great Cover art, terrible execution to the film.
This film has been sitting around for many years before it's release.  It shows.  The quality is very low and it doesn't add to ruff performances.  Even amazing cameos and great performances from Debbie Rochon (Colour From the Dark) and P.J. Soles (Halloween), is not enough to save this film.
A good attempt but unfortunately it's way to formulaic and not really enjoyable.  I watched most of it in fast forward until I got to actors I wanted to see.  Seriously just not worth the money I spent.",1454284800,,545,4.635416666666667
