5426629,3,B00AIBZMD6,"The last time we saw Jack Ryan on the big screen, he was tackling terrorists in the 2002 flick, The Sum of All Fears, starring Ben Affleck. Prior to that film, Ryan had been played by two other well-known actors, Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) and Harrison Ford (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger). The majority of these films were well-received, at least as individual tales, but for a character that progresses steadily over several Tom Clancy novels, the films really lacked proper continuity - not to mention the fact that the films didn't necessarily always resemble the characters within the books. In any event, it has been nearly 12 years since we last saw Ryan, and the character is long overdue for a revamp, which he receives in the film franchises reboot, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.

Directed by Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Mary Shelleys Frankenstein), Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit stars Chris Pine as Jack Ryan, a young college student studying abroad that decides to join the Marines after witnessing the events of 9/11 on television. On a mission, he and his unit are shot down while traveling in a helicopter - but they manage to live through the event. However, Ryan is badly hurt with a broken spine and is forced to learn how to walk all over again. His nurse, Cathy (Keira Knightley), peeks his romantic interest and after his recovery they begin dating one another.

While still in rehab for his injuries, Ryan is approached by Thomas Harper (Kevin Coster), a member of the CIA that recruits Ryan to become an undercover agent in the financial sector - looking for money that could be connected to terrorists. Unsurprisingly, he take notice of a substantial amount of money being moved around and jumps a plan to Russia to audit the corporation controlling the money - headed by Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh). Once face-to-face with Cherevin, it doesnt take long for Ryan to realize hes stumbled on something huge - only to have matters complicated when his bride-to-be, Cathy, follows him overseas.

Prior to his role as Captain James T. Kirk in the J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot, Chris Pine was a completely unknown actor. However, Star Trek was a hit and suddenly Pines career was off and running - landing a handful of roles in films like Unstoppable and This Means War. Now, Pine is cast in another franchise reboot as the American version of James Bond, Jack Ryan - thus thrusting his career ever higher. Not to pass judgment on Pines role as Jack Ryan, but this hardly feels like a monumental role for him (even though it is).

The role of Jack Ryan is a huge catch and Chris Pine is very likeable in this role, but hes certainly not the best man to play the character - and might just be the low man on the totem poll. Thats not necessarily a knock on him because lets face it, Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, and Ben Affleck are pretty tough acts to follow. Still, Pine successfully passes the test as a spy and delves right into another role that will define his young career - assuming the film is a success. He has the look, build, and charisma to be one of Hollywoods next big action stars, in the event that he wants to keep making roles of this nature.

While Pine is average enough in the role of Jack Ryan, the supporting cast is much more of an eyebrow raiser. Keira Knightley, who portrays the generic love interest, takes a role that is very unusual. Shes typically all about the historical-themed roles, which shes excelled at in certain films, particularly Atonement, Anna Karenina, and even the first three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But, in her relatively bland role of Cathy, Knightley seems very out of place and she gives off the impression that shes taken on a character that doesnt deserve her attention. In all honesty, any up-and-coming actress looking to break out could have benefited more from the part that Knightley, who is unmistakably well-established as one of the finer actresses in film.

Next up is Hollywood legend, Kevin Costner. Most of us know Costner for his great films, like Dances with Wolves and Field of Dreams, while we try to forget the bad, like The Postman and Waterworld. As a focused CIA agent in this film, he also leaves quite a bit to be desired - mostly because of his characters lack of personality. He comes off as serious, relentless, and by the book. And, he seems so devoted to the cause that you almost cant help but wonder if hes the real bad guy in the film, just waiting for a time to make the turn - thus leading to a climactic toe-to-toe contest with Chris Pines younger, less skeptical character. However, if you - like me - were hoping for it to go down like that, allow me to squash your hopes right now.  Instead, director
Kenneth Branagh stars in the film, playing an extremely forgettable antagonist.

Overall, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is about what youd expect from a film with that title. The plot is as predictable as other similar films, like Die Hard, Mission Impossible, or the Bourne Identity films. For a spy film, Jack Ryan is entertaining enough to make you forget about the world for its duration, but at the same time, theres nothing special to make this stand out above any other Jack Ryan film. Im sorry to say Jack Ryan is definitely no James Bond. Most notable though is the new-age threat the world is facing: economical terrorism. If you want to cripple a country, attack that economy - a theme we will no doubt see more and more of as the world moves away from a nuclear threat and more towards something much more realistic. But, don't worry, its hard to imagine filmmakers and movie studios will give up on movie plots that aim to destroy the world fifteen times over. In the end, though, Shadow Recruit is just another typical means of entertainment - nothing more, nothing less.

5426630,4,B00AIBZMD6,"First, let me note that there are some spoilers in this review and let me state that it is a very good movie.  However, when you see this movie, you will quickly note that the time here doesn't add up and this is more like a reboot of the series than a prequel and as soon as you see the movie, you will likely agree.

Again, I had the pleasure of being invited to this screening and I wasn't going to pass it up being one of the few movies that interests me at the present time.

ACTING

This is really a strong point for the movie!

Chris Pine (Star Trek Reboot) does a great job in the role of Jack Ryan and I'm glad the forgettable Ben Affleck only got one shot at the role (Only thing ladies, Chris Pine's less than perfect complexion shows up big time under these cameras).

Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Carribean) as Cathy was the most memorable iteration of the character in the series and they made a really good choice here.

Kevin Costner (JFK) plays the part of Thomas, the preceptor to Jack Ryan and in typical fashion, Kevin's cool, calm, and collected character works well as the seasoned vet for the CIA who never seems to panic in any situation.

Kenneth Branagh (Thor) plays the Russian Financier who appears to be the leader of a movement in the Russian underworld struggling to help bring Russia back to the center of the world at the expense of the United States, it becomes clear that he is only a piece of the puzzle as the movie progresses but, he does a convincing job as the main villain in the film.

STORY

  Again, stop reading if you don't want details...

The movie is set in a post 9/11 world (This is a big reason why this is absolutely not a prequel) and Jack Ryan is pursuiting his doctored at Oxford University in England (Isn't this where all super spy's go?) and we're shown the events of 9/11 unfolding as the crowds flock to the Television sets on the Campus.  After 9/11 Jack Ryan enlists in the Marines where he gets deployed to Afghanistan.

Predictable Events unfold that lead to Jack's Helicopter being shot out of the sky and his role in the war is over.  In a military hospital, his spine is stabilized and and he begins therapy where he meets Med Student Cathy (His future wife) and she agrees to have dinner with him, ""the day he runs completely out of the hospital"".

While in the hospital, Thomas is introduced and we see him watching a very promising analytical mind in the form of Jack Ryan.  He later offers Jack a job in the CIA working for Wall street where they will analyze financial data to prevent another 9/11 from ever happening again and Jack accepts.

In the midst of all this, the Russians protest a Turkish Pipeline and force a vote at the UN Summit but, the USA refuses to let Russia have a monopoly on Natural Gas in the far east and votes to approve the pipeline (Conspiracy theorists have long said such pipelines are why we are in the middle east).  Russia considers the vote for the pipeline as an act of economic War and sets in motion a plan to destroy the US Economy.

While working for a financial company, Jack notices transactions where details aren't fully available, he's sent to Moscow to audit the firm responsible for these billion dollar trades as he suspects they're propping up the US economy to short another market.

One thing leads to another and Jack is made an active agent while on duty in Russia and that's all I'm going to say about the story as there's still a lot left to see and I don't want to ruin it for you.

CINEMATOGRAPHY

While sharp at times, blurry at others, there were times when the cameras appeared to have a hard time focusing and it was slightly disorienting to me for all of 5 minutes or so but, overall they did a good job with everything else.

The scenery, on the other hand chosen was gorgeous and if this was truly Russia then it shows the more beautiful locations and it was overall very nice to look at.

CONTENT

Rated PG-13

Nudity = None I recall
Gun Fire = a handful of scenes coming later in the movie not a ton.
Car Chases = 1 Pseudo chase
Fights = 3 or 4 tops
Cursing = very little

CONCLUSION

At times, Jack Ryan seems a little too unrealistically smart with a knack for being in the right place at the right time but, the Movie itself was very good.  If you're assuming that this movie is a suspenseful thriller with twists you might find in a Bond movie, it isn't!  What this is a very good action movie that delivers in a big way and it is a great way for Hollywood to start off the new year!

 Highly recommend seeing this movie even if you're not a fan of the Tom Clancy Novels.",1389830400,318,4615,4.321718931475029
5426631,5,B00AIBZMD6,"What does a ""covert CIA analyst"" do? Director Kenneth Branagh (""Thor"") explains it all, and our screening audience got to watch this action/thriller to find out! Branagh is a slam-bang director of action films, so we were pleased to see his name here.

This is a new set up for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series with our hero as a fumbling recruit, already whip smart but ill-prepared for his first kill. Planted by the CIA as an analyst in a stock brokerage, he is sent to Moscow to interview one of his employer's clients. He has an immediate trial by fire, with a violent attempt on his life, complicated by an unexpected visit from his girlfriend who ""just wanted to surprise"" him. Eek!

We have:
  * Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") as Jack Ryan, our eponymous hero, resourceful and observant, but not quite sure about his assignment. He thinks he is supporting ""our man"" until he discovers that he IS ""our man!""
  * Keira Knightley (""The Duchess"") is his fiance Cathy, a doctor who, while doing her residency, had served as his physical therapist after he was hurt in Afghanistan.
  * Kevin Costner (""Man of Steel"") is Thomas Harper, an analyst for the CIA who serves in the military as a cover.
  * Kenneth Branagh (""Wallander"") is Viktor Cherevin, the mastermind behind a terrorist plot against Wall Street.

This has a huge cast, but much of this film is done at a full gallop, so we didn't linger very long in any one place. There is excitement and tension, along with the unmitigated pleasure of looking at Chris Pine for 105 minutes...smile...

This is rated PG-13, so expect lots of gunfire, vehicular mayhem, stabbings, clever repartee, great scenery, the CIA's astonishing use of digital equipment, and a white-knuckle countdown with a time bomb. Whew!

Amazon will notify me so I can tell my JayFlix.net folks when this is available on DVD.",1389744000,19,1844,4.725

5426699,1,B00AIBZMD6,"Found this very trite, boring and predictable, and came to the conclusion that I really don't like Chris Pine as an actor. I disliked him in the terrible Trek remakes and he's even less appealing here. Paired with obnoxious Kiera Knightley makes this film even less tolerable, and Kevin Costner just seems to be here to remind viewers that he's much better cast in westerns than boring international thrillers. Kenneth Brannagh is the tired, predictable mastermind bad guy. The plot is about, I don't know, crashing the US economy or something, in revenge for ""mother Russia"" or some such thing. The story is predictable and I started tuning it out when Kiera, the obnoxious girlfriend, insists on going along to stop the villain, even though she isn't even part of the CIA. How they allowed this, instead of just shipping her home, is just typical Hollywood stupid story-telling.

One additional observation, neither here nor there, is that Chris Pine has a massive head. Towards the end of the film there's a scene where Kiera give's him a hug with her skeletal thin body, and his head just looks enormous in comparison to her. I know this probably isn't PC to observe things like this, but it was a striking contrast, as the entirety of his head seemed to occupy almost the same space as Kiera's entire body.

Otherwise the film was dull dull dull....",1515283200,,1354,4.782051282051282

5426826,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Review of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Its always hard, when you're the fan of an original, to watch a modern remake and give it a fair chance. If you loved Harrison Fords Jack Ryan movies, Im not sure how youll react to this reboot with Chris Pine. I never saw the originals, so to me, this was a brand new action movie.

I wouldnt call myself an action movie gal but I do enjoy the genre. Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit earns a place at the top in my book, right up there with Tom Cruises Mission Impossible movies. The action scenes are exciting, and between Kenneth Branaghs menacing Russian bad guy tactics and Kevin Costners air of mystery, the tension keeps you hooked throughout. Also, usually in action movies theres some sort of comic relief. Sometimes the humor is stupid, but not in this one. Theres a clever banter written in for the lovebirds, and it gives you a laugh without making the movie silly.

Now, Im the first to admit my bias, so here it goes: Keira Knightly is my favorite modern actress. Keira plays Chris Pines girlfriend; even though she doesnt have a very big part, she is my favorite part of the movie and the reason I keep watching it. I mean, what man alive wouldnt go to the ends of the earth to keep her out of harms way?

Shadow Recruit is a really good action flick, perfect for a guys or girls weekend. And there aren't any sex scenes, so its a great date movie, with eye candy for both of you!",1497744000,4,1455,4.318681318681318
5426827,3,B00AIBZMD6,"I was surprised, when watching the end credits, to see that this film was directed by Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the villain with some relish). Its competently made but, like his Cinderella not the sort of vehicle that you would imagine calculated to make the best use of his prodigious talents.

In addition to Branagh himself, Chris Pine is an adequate young Jack Ryan, Keira Knightley plays the love interest, Kevin Costner is a CIA mentor and Mikhail Baryshnikov makes a classy cameo appearance.

There are some good action sequences but overall the film comes off as rather like a low-budget Mission Impossible movie  the sort of film where the good guys have a truckload of high-tech equipment to enable them the hero to gain access to a high-security building, although here this was also accomplished  equally implausibly  by Keira Knightleys character distracting the villain by her flirting.

The Russian guy gets 2nd place, though much of his problem was likely the writers and directors. The story/script was poorly handled... or more like seriously Overhandled, stepped on, and ""choppy"" was the order of the day, any ""flow"" thought to be in the script never showed up. The claim the dialogue was stilted is a gift beyond measure, it was adamant like the rock of ages never touched by water or the sun... going No Place Any Viewer wanted to see/hear/be. Its my belief the actors showed up and did their best, the drama and story had momentum.. so whoever was to relate this to realism fell down on the job. The actors picked it up as they could resulting in an OK movie with too many over-acted scenes that could have benefited from a lighter touch and more leeway for the actors to seem to be real people, not actors on the stage. The violent action sequences were interesting, likely the best thing in the movie. That doesn't please me me much, though, because its the STORY and Characterization that does it for me, Oh WELL, maybe next time..... I'll never figure out how you mess up a Tom Clancy work.

5426906,5,B00AIBZMD6,"This film deserves the overwhelming accolades it received. It is a better than good, suspenseful, tension-filled film about a comparatively young Jack Ryan who is prompted to join the marines when he hears about 9/11, is badly wounded during an attack when he heroically saves the lives of two fellow soldiers, is recruited by the CIA, falls in love with his doctor (or, more precisely, with the beautiful woman who is treating him who is going to medical school and would shortly be a doctor), CIA pays for his continued studies where he receives his PhD, is assigned by the CIA to a desk undercover job, who discovers a Russian plot to destroy the US, and is told by the CIA to go to Russia to stop the attack for he alone can understand the complexities of the issues, and where he performs so well that he is made an operating agent.
The film is filled with tension both by the Russian who heads the attack against the US, which if successful would destroy the US, and between Ryan and his wife who does not know that he is working for the CIA and wonders if he is having an affair.
The acting in the film is excellent. There is an all-star cast. the film moves fast and the suspense moves without let-up.",1485734400,,1209,4.426008968609866

5427429,3,B00AIBZMD6,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy books, at least the ones he actually wrote. I probably read all of them at least 3 or 4 times. They are good enough that they can be re-read every few years. This movie on the other hand is not really a Tom Clancy type story. Little in it is plausible. It is just one implausible thing after another. It starts out okay and is fairly plausible, but takes multiple turns to the goofy and never gets back on track. There's plenty of shooting and fighting and car chases and a big bomb that really isn't much of a bomb and Russian bad guys who are going to blow up Wall Street. Somehow this combined with selling two trillion worth of dollars the Russians have accumulated is going to cause the u.s. to enter a depression. Like I said nothing really plausible but bits and pieces of it are moderately entertaining so I'm going to give it 3 stars. My guess is if you'd like to Clancy books you probably won't like this one very much just because it's so far out in left field as far as being believable. But as a basic spy thriller it is tolerable. Just to make it even more implausible somehow his girlfriend is allowed to get mixed up in the spy business",1467763200,,1180,4.225663716814159

5427431,3,B00AIBZMD6,"Marine Jack Ryan suffers a crippling spinal wound in the line of duty and is invalided out of the service. Waiting for him is an offer to join the CIA in covertly tracking foreign transactions as an undercover agent on Wall Street. His discovery of some currency manipulations by a Russian holding company send Ryan to Moscow to trace back the source and reasons for the discrepancies.

As a fan of Tom Clancy's complex plots and technothrillers, I found this movie to be a disappointment.

Putting aside the transformation of Jack Ryan from a history professor to an economics expert and the fact that the CIA has no authority to conduct investigations within the USA, the plot itself is a thin one. Lots of screen time was spent on digital cityscapes of Moscow and New York City, car chases, and long shots of room decor, but little thought or screen time was given to developing the plot details, logical plot explanations, or even character development.

Costner plays the mysterious CIA recruiter and handler who always seems to be at exactly the right place at the right moment with whatever information or personnel is needed at the time. Branagh as the Russian mastermind does a credible Russian accent, while remaining stoic and unemotional in just about every scene.

Pine as the alleged hero of the movie, was fine in scenes with his on-screen wife portrayed by Knightly, but didn't sell the action hero side of the film well.

As for the plot, instead of building the solution over the course of the movie with steadily plotted actions and revelations, the writers went for a rapid-fire core dump of conclusion jumping by Ryan and his CIA helpers that was enough to give the viewer whiplash.

Not recommended for Clancy fans who enjoy complex and logical plotting, but if you're the beat 'em up car chase type, this movie would probably work for you.",1467763200,10,1862,4.785046728971962

5428468,5,B00AIBZMD6,A very exciting movie with non-stop action and suspense as well as a healthy dose of high tech gimmickry. Great acting-Jack Ryan character was very natural and well-played-Kevin Kostner was also very convincing and the rest of the cast excelled in their respective roles.

5428753,3,B00AIBZMD6,"It was fine.  It's not even on the same planet as Red October, but if you literally ignored every prior Jack Ryan movie,  it'd be a reasonable popcorn flick.  As a reboot, it came up with a reasonable more updated backstory to the classic Ryan character.  Keira Knightly and Pine don't have a ton of chemistry; just some moments here and there.  I've seen it twice and I'm back and forth as to what I think about Costner's character.  I think I mostly like it, but it falls a little flat to the relationship dynamic between James Earl Jones and both Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford.  But if you can leave the prior portrayals of Ryan's mentor in the rear view mirror, Costner isn't too bad.  The resst of the characters are underdeveloped and completely forgettable, including the ""villain"".",1466553600,,790,4.633093525179856

5429656,2,B00AIBZMD6,"The film starts out promisingly enough but through a series of bad choices it becomes sillier and less believable  -even under its own terms - than I could stand.  One problem is that the film is hellbent on accentuating the importance of the relationship between Ryan and his wife, played by, Kiera Whatshername.  The fact is - she really has nothing to do with the second half of the film's story which is pretty damned bifurcated in a way I haven't seen since Full Metal Jacket.  And yet - there she is.  She just stays there - hangs around - trying to make a contribution when she could be out getting a cheeseburger - which, believe me, she could use as she is dangerously skinny here.  She's also amazingly annoying.  I'm not sure why, but  this is as off-putting a performance as any I've seen since Sofia was in Godfather 3.  Kenneth Whatshisname - who is supposed to be this accomplished Shakespearean actor just hams it up here, with the Russian accent and inherent evil, blah blah blah.  He's about as scary as Boris from Rocky and Bullwinkle.  Chris Pine tries emoting on occasion. That turns out to be a mistake.  He's terrific in the Star Trek movies - but here is left looking like yet another failed Matt Damon Bourne Again imitator. Kevin Costner takes the money and runs - a wise decision.",1466035200,3,1307,4.538461538461538

5429890,4,B00AIBZMD6,"I felt like the marketing for this film was pretty misleading.  I remember watching the preview and thinking this was following a Mission Impossible arc, and Jack was going to be double crossed by his mentor and girlfriend.  But it actually felt very much like Patriot Games.  Upright American patriotism, foreign enemies, sleuth work, and heart racing chase scenes.  Chris Pine is fun to watch and brings a lot of emotion to the character that makes you really feel for his character.  Kevin Costner is cool, and Kiera Knightley is drop dead gorgeous.  Though, It's kinda weird hearing her using an American accent.  It was distracting, because I found myself listening too carefully each time she talked hoping to catch her slip up.  It was a fun movie, and I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.  There are a couple of bad points.  It's not exactly clear how Knightley's character follows Jack to Moscow, and Costner's character felt too much like Jack's safety net.

Let alone having his girl friend participate in his mission in Moscow.  Also, the 10 min. window for hacking the info is just plain impossible and purely for the purpose of creating an exciting scene for the unsuspected movie viewers.

5432168,3,B00AIBZMD6,"Your basic, action flick, without nearly as interesting of a plot as many others in genre (Bond, Bourne, etc.) Worth watching for an hour and a half. I suspect the movie was probably longer but the editors realized the straight forward nature of the plot and cut the running time down to keep the pace and length of the movie entertaining.",1462752000,,339,4.573770491803279

5432201,4,B00AIBZMD6,"This story is along the lines of a mix of the Borne Identity series, James Bond series, Taken series, etc.

So, if you love that kind of movie, then this one should provide great enjoyment to you.

Now I did not give it 5 stars, because once you've seen Jason Borne, you've seen the very best of this type.  Everything else almost has to have a somewhat lower rating.  This one of those times I wish Amazon allowed a 4.5 rating, because that's where I'd put this one.  It's well done, holds your attention throughout, and is one of those movies that a person will likely watch several times in their lifetime.",1462579200,,609,4.401785714285714

5432204,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Good action. The acting was pretty good.  The spoken Russian is better than most movies.  The plot was pretty good, but there were some very improbable scenarios, the most improbable was how the CIA team got onto a jet, into the air and out of Russia within minutes - and with no resistance from the Russian government.  The messy hotel room clean-up was also quite fast and thorough for an hour's time frame.  We cannot clean our house that fast and we have no broken glass to clean up nor bullet holes to patch.  The last second truck bomb explosion in the water was par for these kinds of thrillers.  All in all, good entertainment - typical Tom Clancy stuff.  Wife & I enjoyed it and did not consider it a waste of our time.",1462579200,,728,4.348148148148148

5432225,1,B00AIBZMD6,"Not the worst Jack Ryan movie (that distinction belongs to ""The Sum of All Fears""), but it's pretty bad. Paramount had some good momentum with this series with Harrison incarnation of this character, but some reason they s***-canned the whole crew and hired Ben Affleck. Ben won't be back, and I don't think we'll see Chris Pine reprise this role any time soon. Surprisingly, Kevin Costner did a pretty good job, but the whole show is pretty adolescent and not worth your time.",1462492800,,477,4.759036144578313

5432445,1,B00AIBZMD6,Did we really want this?  The whole point of the Jack Ryan movies (least as far as I could tell) was that a competent patriot of a main character used his political knowledge to diffuse dangerous situations.  He's not the ultimate soldier he's just dedicated and knowledgeable.  This movie dumbs down the political drama and has a romance that would be more at home in a comedy.  On its own the movie's just boring and poorly made but it delivers a gut punch the Jack Ryan movie franchise on top of all that.  This movie is another example of the movie industry taking something with its own uniqueness and shoving it through the bland machine to make it indistinguishable from 8 other action spy thrillers.  Hopefully it gets a new reboot where there's actually a Jack Ryan movie to be watched.,1461456000,,795,4.602836879432624

5432574,3,B00AIBZMD6,"The plot is silly.  If you want a good action flick without exercising your brain too much about the plausibility of the whole thing, this will do.",1459814400,,147,4.444444444444445
5432575,4,B00AIBZMD6,"So as a fan of the previous Ryan installments I was hesitant about this one; obviously for I have just now actually seen it.  I always enjoyed Ford's characterisation as well as Baldwin's, so I saw the Affleck version with hesitancy.  But hearing that Ford had himself helped with that version, nonetheless, I was impressed. So I saw this as another cheap way to make a Hollywood buck.  I was wrong.

The casting was well done-I especially enjoyed Colm Feore having a part.  The plot, albeit mildly predictable, was unique & I enjoyed the new twist with the financial direction.  The production was superb & the script well written & flawlessly delivered.  Yes, there will always be what people consider goofs, errors but hey, no one ever complained that munchkins or ewoks are not real; albeit without a significant dose of herbal relaxation & Pink Floyd. To those that understand this reference, bravo.  To the others, I digress.

A well done film & a fun movie to watch.  It did keep my attention & suspense was nice.  I would probably watch this again, was I not coughing so much from bronchitis, pneumonia, or the flu--the jury's out right now.  Regardless, illnesses are too important to be left to juries.

Wonderful film. I would not be against seeing more installments down the road.  Kevin Costner was great in his role-emotionless & to the point, as one must be in this field.  Pine did a great job as Jack & Knightley was impressive as well. Branagh did a great job directing this & playing the role of Fearless Leader.  Hats off to all involved.

Chris Pine does nothing to help the story and his rapid rise from Wall Street analysis to super spy is laughable. The climax of the movie is as well. Kevin Costner plays the role as a has-been actor. And I was left with the bitterness of yet another hit piece on the Russians and how they could be involved in a terror plot in America. Yes, because the Russians want to promote acts of terror...not Muslims. Simply put, subtle corporate propoganda. The Cold War ended, let's move on.",1457222400,2,612,4.572727272727272

I did stop the movie.  I went to google and searched for some way to turn this moronic x-ray feature off.  No luck.  Watch on amazon - suffer this idiotic value-added feature.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie..... Costner did a great job at being a bad-a$$ spook, without trying to 'upstage' the star of the film.  Chris Pine did a great job, too..... you really felt the pain of his physical blocks, and he projects much emotion in eyes and facial expression, that some actors might not have been able accomplish.

Filming was dark....in keeping with the theme.....and though sometimes you had to 'catch up' with what was happening, you really get involved easily with the struggles of this brilliant analyst, whose mind works faster than most computers..... and who truly cares about his country.",1456358400,3,784,4.87218045112782

5433184,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Chris Pine probably makes a better Jack Ryan than he does a Captain Kirk.  Kenneth Branagh is quite threatening as the bad guy, and what can I say about Kiera Knightley that hasn't already been written?  Plenty of action and suspense, despite the inherent difficulty of dramatizing action that takes place within a character's mind.  It's obvious that they meant to portray Jack Ryan as a genius analyst and it works.

My first Jack Ryan was Alec Baldwin in ""Hunt for Red October,"" which is still one of my all-time favorite movies.  Chris Pine has not surpassed him in this role yet, but I'd like to see him try again.",1456012800,,619,4.590909090909091

I believe it did have one congruency error.  Jack Ryan was not injured in Afghanistan on active duty.

He finished his last year at Annapolis while in the hospital.",1455926400,,392,4.450704225352113

Kostner as the seasoned handler is convincingly low-key. Keira Knightly is charming. But of course Chris Pine's bluer-than-blue eyes steel everyone else's spotlight.,1455667200,,328,5.326923076923077

It had lots of good action with a fairly complex plot and an outstanding cast. I got the distinct impression I was viewing a formulaic albeit efficiently produced action movie or to put it more bluntly, Hollywood product. I found the Russian plot to destroy our economy somewhat tame, given the fact that we can easily do that to ourselves without any outside assistance. The white guys on white guys cloak and dagger had a sort of retro forties feel, as if we have anything to fear from the Russians these days, given the terrifying realities we face in the Middle East. Nevertheless, a very watchable brain rester that should please spy thriller fans. Nice to see classically trained Shakespearean actor Branaugh doing action films.",1454544000,,838,4.908450704225352

5433877,2,B00AIBZMD6,"Spoiler Alert:  Jack Ryan is a U.S. Marine 2nd Lt who has his back broken in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan; he was working on his PhD dissertation when he joined the Marines immediately after the 911 attacks on the U.S.  Following operation(s) and physical therapy, Jack is recruited as a CIA undercover analyst working for a financial firm on Wall Street.  The story picks up 10 years later (we're never told anything about what happened during those 10 years) when Jack is told to go to Russia to investigate what appears to be Russian attempts to manipulate the U.S. dollar.  Upon his arrival a paid assassin attempts to kill Jack, but the desk chair analyst fights off the would-be killer and actually kills the professional assassin.  When his girlfriend shows up unannounced  in Moscow and is kidnapped by FSB agents Jack pulls off some of the most remarkable driving seen on film, kills several more agents and rescues the girlfriend.  He then flies back to NY, hops on a friend's motorcycle (I'm not kidding), demonstrates that his extraordinary driving skills are not limited to cars, and kills the would-be terrorist bomber, thereby saving NYC.  Mind you, Jack does all of this despite the fact that he suffered a broken back and is now at least 37 years old and perhaps a little older (do the math: undergraduate degree at 21, if he entered college at 17; three years of graduate school classes and much, though not all, of a dissertation completed by 25 years {that's really fast}; Marine Corps training, combat deployment, and injury by 26-27; recovery by 28 (the guy does not fool around); 10 years later he's sent to Moscow, making him 37-38.  Remember, he's not a field agent (until he kills the Moscow assassin) and he's pushing 40, but the only thing he does not do is fly from Moscow to NYC without the aid of a plane.  It just doesn't wash.",1453507200,,1864,4.690184049079755

And is tricked by one of the most inept drunk acts on the planet?  No one can put two and two together until Ryan figures out the fix in something like thirty seconds?  They have the bad guy in their midst when rescuing the girl (who's  threatened with a deadly light bulb--I wish I were kidding), and they don't eliminate the bad guy or capture him or interrogate him?

5434034,1,B00AIBZMD6,"It's been a while since I saw this, but I had to refute the generally positive reviews on here. This is easily the worst big budget studio film I've seen in years. The other Jack Ryan movies stay true to the concept - an analyst forced into field operations by an unforeseen emergency. Here he somehow instantly transforms into Jason Bourne overnight without even a pretense of explanation. How is that possible for a man who recently retired from the Marines due to severe war injuries? Who cares! Not the people who made this thing. Any Jack Ryan movie is going to make money. Why waste time doing a good job. I can't even begin to list all the preposterous elements. Ryan is sent in to infiltrate the Russian bad guys lair - I don't know why - maybe the CIA doesn't have any trained operatives there (you know, in MOSCOW). Ryan's wife is kidnapped and shown wrapped head to toe in duct tape - when she's rescued a few few minutes latter she steps of of the getaway car with a single piece of duct tape dangling from her shoulder. And so on.
I don't have super high standards for action movies. And I like the Jack Ryan series and I've like all of the actor's in other things. Even dreadful director/co-star Kenneth Branagh did some good things when he was young. But this movie used up all my tolerance and good will before I was 15 minute in.  The only thing that kept me entertained was playing ""find the plot hole"".
Those are the cons. I guess the pro is that the actions sequences are good enough. I suppose the positive reviews are from people who weren't looking for anything move than that. If that's you then go ahead and watch it. If not then watch one of the other JR movies. Or pretty much any other movie. It doesn't get worse than this.",1450483200,,1752,4.374233128834356

Lot's of intrigue and action, which is in all these types of movies, but it will not leave you so bored you want to turn it off. If you like the other movies, you'll like this one. I give it 5 stars because I like Chris Pine and the movie is well done, although all the chase scene's and shoot-em-ups is beyond comprehension, but you get the picture (pun). :)",1448236800,,492,4.189473684210526

The story-line, which doesn't make much sense,  is improbable, implausible, and completely unbelievable.  10 mins into it, I said to myself, this is a stupid movie, and it got worse from there.  Along with the plot, the characters are totally unbelievable--the Russian, Jack's girlfriend, the CIA chief, all of them are one layer of cliche after another.  The scene with the Russian, Jack (the one man audit unit) and his wife at the restaurant is painful.  If I could rate the movie less than one-star, I would.  Don't waste your time.

5434300,3,B00AIBZMD6,"Jack Ryan Shadow recruit is not bad movie, it is about on par with every other action movie coming out today.  I have to agree with other reviewers though that I see the character Jack Ryan as an analyst not as a field agent.  I don't need to see Jack be James Bond.  There is enough copy cat character action movies out there like that for instance the Bourne series or Jack Reacher.

When I think of Jack Ryan I always go back to Alec Baldwins portrayal in The Hunt For Red October.  He just nailed that part perfectly and it is such a shame Alec did not stay on with character to do Patriot Games or Clear and Present Danger.  Image those films without Harrison Ford and with Baldwin.  Harrison Ford did not do a bad job, he portrayed the character honestly and accurately, he just seemed too old for the role.  But Harrison did play the character as an analyst using information and his brain to solve problems instead of simply going all Rambo special agent shoot em up save the world action hero.

I did not see the Sum of All Fears with Ben Affleck so I cannot comment on it.  But from what I have heard it did not get very good ratings either.

Chris Pine is a good actor, I thought he was great in the last Star Trek Into Darkness movie.  Kevin Costner does a nice job as a mentor although I really liked James Earl Jones a little bit more in past movies as the mentor character, maybe he is to old now to play the part.  The film is pretty fast paced, I liked Keira Knightley, she seems feisty and does a good job in the role of Catherine Muller.  Kenneth Branagh also plays a pretty decent villain.  Overall he is not as strong a character as the evil Russian mobster in The Equalizer movie Teddy Rensen, that guy was terrifying.  But maybe that is not a fair comparison.

Minor spoiler

I found it strange that the Embree character would be tasked to eliminate Jack so quickly.  Jack did not seem like that much of a risk to the endeavor or scheme at that point.  I kind of found that hard to believe.  You would think the henchman would of have tried to take Jack out on the street or in a back alley someplace to make it seem like a random attack as if done by chance.  Same thing with the young villain knifing everybody the whole movie and he does not try and take out Jack Ryan with the blade seemed kind of silly.

Overall I found the film entertaining if not predictable.  Hopefully the next installment will have Mr. Ryan pursuing threats from intellegence and having Navy Seal teams or Special Ops do the tactical action more similar to Tom Clancys novels.  It is not a bad popcorn thriller.  I would rate it probably 3 to 3  stars out of 5.",1447977600,,2662,4.250996015936255

It may be me but the point that the lead Russian bad guy had a painting of Napoleon at Waterloo didn't lead to me to conclude the bomb was going to be placed where Ryan said it would (not to give away the ending).,1447632000,,297,4.5

I must say I was a bit offended by the ridiculous plot scenarios; like conquering one of the world's most advanced security systems in 10 minutes and predicated on being able to pickpocket an ex KGB operative - twice; then with 12 hours notice flying to the US and foiling a brilliant terrorist caper that had been planned for years. I know, I know, all super spy thrillers have this stuff. I get that. But this one seemed to require me to suspend reality even more than usual.",1447286400,,621,4.544642857142857

Where he takes a mission to Moscow and almost gets assassinated by his escort upon arrive at his suite.

When u get the give prize, and check out ur nice view, thats when ur most vulnerable. If your response isn't as quick as ur reflex, u will be shot. Be well trained. And drown the sucker who weighs about maybe 2x ur size.

Dont trust people outside your country, especially those u just meet.

Jack undergoes on a series of putting himself on a quest to find the owner behind the account where he invites the hacker to dinner where he gets distracted by his beautiful finance. Womens alcohol and a lack of awareness can cause u to loose your data.

Be especially careful after getting bumped.

After acknowledging that hes been hacked, he kills his support who critizes him and goes to kidnap the finance.

if ur working for bad people, be very careful of what u say

and if ur under them, and they r at a lost they just might take out the anger on u and shot u.

dont critizied although u known them for a long long time, remember they're bad people, u cant trust bad people

the good side always win becuz of the great support, and the brain behind the operation

jack foresees the plan and chases the bomber. who plans to bomb the foundation of the builds. In the ducati,

(always help people outside of the work, from that u can gave the leverage to saving ur life as well as hundred of thousands of lives, and becuz u were such a good person to others those people will give the world to u and help u with times when u need their help the most) a name, a simple act of sincerity to help other other person get what they wanted, ull gain so much more when at times u need it the most.

which becomes ruined later, allows jack to give us a great thrilling chase of the bombing vehichile where he performs a spectacular stunt, ride on the side of the walls, and continued the chase to the water sewer where then breaks out to a fist fight. Jack steals the vehicle and drives it out of the underground water tunnel and unto the streets, where the outside matter didn't matter and jack just hitting car to car as if it doesnt matter, to prevent the bomber to override the bomb, and truly it didn't at this situation.

Really puts the viewers in perspective that all these stuff doesnt matter and what really matters is the lives of the people. Lucky jack found the ocean and floors it as he hops to the back and tries to wrestle the bomer out, unfortunately time is running out and jack jumps off the car and rolls on the floor as the suv rams straight down into the ocean and KA-BOOM! water splashed 50 feet in the air creating a instant water mountain, which then goes flat. The buildings of wallstreet were saved along with hundreds of thousands of peoples live. Jack is the hero who saved the 2nd 911 x3.

I don't think the plot and script are as strong as 'Hunt for Red October', but it was definitely better than most of the Jack Ryan films. Chris Pine is excellent like always, and Keira Knightley is less annoying in this film. Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Costner also do excellent work. Overall, I would say this is a good movie.

5434960,4,B00AIBZMD6,"As a movie about how Jack Ryan got started, I can see why they would want to rush through his genesis, building him up to the level of a super intelligent spy with tremendous physical abilities and a fabulous wife. But after that, he becomes almost like a Bruce Willis character, able to do things even Batman would be proud of, which I think was not the point of the books or the previous movies. In spite of that, I'm giving it the 4 stars because it was good entertainment and that's what these types of movies are made for.

The subject matter was timely, considering what's happening real time in US and Russia relations so that was a plus, topic wise. Also, I think that Kenneth Branagh did a good job entertaining us, as both the main protagonist in the film and by his direction. This was in spite of the script but that's what good directors do. Chris Pine did fine, considering what he was given. Also, Costner and Knightly brought dimension to their characters, adding some depth to the film. Good actors do that too. So seeing this movie was ok by me.

So bottom line, it's a good one to watch. It's not just a shoot-em-up affair, so if you can get past some of the ""oh wow, he did what?"" parts, it's worth the time to see it..",1443484800,,1239,4.313304721030043

Reason is that when a real movie star, even an aging one like Mr. Costner,  is in a scene with a wannabe, the wannabe comes up short. It was even more pronounced in the scenes with Mr. Pine and Sir Kenneth Branagh, who steals the film. This has nothing to do with Mr. Pine's acting ability or good looks.

looks like the term ""fancy driver"" means he needs a really quick bath... cannot believe I watched the entire film, it was achingly trite, boring, predictable, and a snooze fest... keira is a gorgeous woman but they really downplay her looks especially when she is supposed to 'entertain' a billionaire Russian, how bout a lil lip rouge baby??

loved the bourne series, but this is deep fried bull caca at it's best, remember chris pine from the Napa movie and he was great but guess he was hoping those blue eyes would penetrate the worldwide audience and make them shiver for surprises, nice try kid...

5435248,5,B00AIBZMD6,I'm an old fan of Tom Clancey spy-thriller novels and have been excited to see some of his earlier Jack Ryan books brought to the big screen.  Shadow Recruit does Clancey justice in bringing the spy-political game ahead 20 years to today's technology and real world fears of terror strikes on our financial institutions.  I enjoyed the story and the ways that brought Clancey's Jack Ryan to us - the back injury from a helicopter accident to his lovely wife.

5435317,5,B00AIBZMD6,"I really enjoyed this movie. It tied well into the other Jack Ryan films, especially The Hunt For Red October. The story was suspenseful and well paced. Chris Pine did a very believable job on the character of Jack Ryan. The action was good and not so rapid fire as to be bewildering. The production company did not give in to the ever present temptation to kill the audience with special effects. This allowed a credible and well designed plot to come out.",1441584000,,457,4.518072289156627

No, a change of pace and proof that, if she chooses, her career can have serious longevity based on her capacity to play a given character.

5435403,5,B00AIBZMD6,"Let me start by telling Jack Ryan is very good movie. Worth the watch.

The story starts with the 9/11 incident and then his tour of duty in Afghanistan which leaves him scarred as his helicopter is shot down.
As he recovers from his injuries, he meets Keira Knightely, a medical student. And he also meets CIA, who sets him as an undercover as Financial Agent where he monitors for any terrorist transactions.
When he uncovers some suspicious transactions, he is flown to Moscow where he meets Cherevin, who is planning an attack in Wall Street to bring down the economy of USA. What follows is a series of very interesting scenes,  how he uncovers when and where the attack is planned and how the attach is averted.",1441238400,,717,4.59375

5435536,3,B00AIBZMD6,"""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" started life as a Tom Clancy novel.  Clancy has the nack of keeping you attention.  And, he was well informed.  It's an exciting movie. However, when the logic stops, the special effects maham starts.  At that point, the emphasis changes. Instead of demanding your intellectual attention, it begins to demand your special effects attention.  That's ok, but you should be aware.

5435608,2,B00AIBZMD6,"Predictable and boring. Keira Knightley is possibly in the top five worst female actress category. The second you learn that Ryan is going away ""on business"" you know exactly what is going to happen. So when she shows up in his hotel room you aren't surprised. Then when she is all ""YEAH LETS GO GET THIS BAD GUY! I'm a cool girlfriend who likes danger because I was bored with our relationship before! I was just dropped in the middle of this CIA/spy thing and I am comfortable with it already so lets go, it will be good for our relationship!""

Then no surprise she gets kidnapped and needs saving. I like the subtle, controlled action of the previous movies but this one pandered too much to the modern crowd. I guess I can't fault movie producers for that but I class this movie with the new Star Trek movies. Yeah they are decent action movies because there is action but that is where it ends. You can make any crap movie look good but that doesn't mean it is good. You can blow some stuff up and put a couple mediocre actors in it but it is just ""ok"". This movie was not interesting and it was not suspenseful and it was not convincing. The type of people who like this kind of movie are the same type of people who like Fast and Furious and don't care too much about story and flow and quality as long as stuff happens.",1440374400,,1327,4.265873015873016

5435610,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Jack Ryan is too valuable a commodity to allow him to languish in old films like Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger.  Alec Baldwin was certainly the right age to be Jack Ryan and Harrison Ford was pushing the envelope, so it's good to see Chris Pine taking over.  He's the right age and demeanor.

5436036,5,B00AIBZMD6,"Great!
Keira is a real babe! And very brave for putting herself in this movie. (But we cognoscenti knew that after her ""Domino"" (also 5 stars)).
Costner is really great in this one, understating the fatherliness exactly right.
Killing may be harder than surviving. You'd have to ask someone.
The new guy plays it pretty close. A really fine performance. If he had it to do over again, I would look for evidence of the right diet. He's married to an MD, fer chrissakes. He looks just a little suety to me (not that there's anything wrong with that).
Really fine believable action. Good editing. And Moscow! Lermontov! Evocation of Tolstoy... ""the carts came to me in a dream""--- Patton.
Very realistic scenario, but the bad-actors won't likely be Russian whne/if it comes to pass. Check your Congress-critter to see if he/she has bought any RE in Shanghai lately. They like that riverside high-rise, and the VERY expensive vintage Medocs.",1438387200,,937,4.8625

Keira Knightley was okay but not entirely believable. Branagh's direction was formulaic and two dimensional. And Kevin Costner adds absolutely zero and had very little credibility. I kept expecting him to turn into a villain. And he doesn't even do that!

Put Branagh on notice, give Pine and Knightely a second chance and lose Costner!",1436400000,,472,4.9

5436635,5,B00AIBZMD6,"Pine, Knightly, Costner and Branagh - this is a winning combination.

I have been a Ton Clancy fan since the book The Hunt For Red October was released in the mid 1980s.  I was therefore quite intrigued to see this film which though based on one of Tom Clancy's main characters - Jack Ryan - is not based directly on any of his books.  The books hint at a time in Jack's life when he was a marine and injured his back, when he was a commodities broker and earned substantial wealth, that he is married an eye surgeon, and that he went to work for the CIA.  This film ties all of those backstory lines together into a nice little bundle.

Clancy purists should be advised that the movie's timeline is not consistent with Clancy's books.  The timeline in this film starts in 2001 with the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  In the books Ryan's back stories would have taken place in the 1970s to early 1980s.  Still, the film works nicely.

Pine plays a convincing Jack Ryan...smart, brave, loyal, etc.  Costner plays a great control officer who handles Ryan as he moves through a potentially dangerous assignment.  Knightly does a good job as Kathy Muller, Ryan's future wife, and of course Branagh who plays an ultra-nationalist Russian whose main life goal is to restore his country to his view of its former greatness by bringing the USA to its knees.

The story line is rich and engaging.  Character development, especially of Ryan is front and center and flows well.  The film combines a nice mixture of spy field craft, action sequences, suspenseful drama, and extreme though believable events.

All in all this is a film I was excited to add to my library and I look forward to watching many times over the years.",1435363200,,1712,4.567213114754098

5436720,3,B00AIBZMD6,"Not much to say about this movie. It is very mediocre. Aside from Kenneth Branagh, who gives a great performance as the Russian villain, no one else in this movie is very believable in their role. Chris Pine is not a convincing Jack Ryan, Kostner has little to do as the mission chief, and Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress disguised as a modern woman. The action is completely underwhelming; not a mentions-worthy sequence in the entire running time. The villains are a faceless organization that is clearly left mysterious to set up sequels. Ultimately, not a movie that stands on its own. So what about the good? Like I said before, Kenneth Branagh is fun to watch in this movie. There is a fun scene revolving around cleaning a hotel room; and another fun scene revolving around a dinner distraction. And finally, the plot is not terrible. It's actually much more grounded than most of these movies tend to be. The world is not at stake; no explosives, assassinations, or dictatorships. The grand scheme comes down to finance and the global market. Sure this might sound a little boring, but in an age where every movie has to level a city to convince the audience of the danger, it's nice to see a ""realistic"" plot. In summary, you will never regret avoiding this movie, but you will probably not regret watching it either.",1434499200,,1339,4.677966101694915

Won't waste your time, or mine, with all the details why, but will give one small example of what makes this a not ready for prime time movie.

Ryan, on a motorcycle. is chasing the bad guy driving a van. The bad guy swerves to force Ryan to smash into the side of the van with his motorcycle, totaling the bike and temporarily incapacitating Ryan.  Next scene, bad guy drives away. The side of van where the impact occurred is as pristine and untouched as it was before the collision.",1434067200,,629,4.6909090909090905
5436862,5,B00AIBZMD6,"I'm sad this movie didn't do better in the box office so we could get a sequel -- it is one of my favorite Jack Ryan movies. Of course, coming out in January and requiring more thought probably didn't help. The Ryan stories are usually long on action and some espionage but this required you to follow along with economic terrorism -- not your typical action weapon and not for the easiest subject to grasp all of the nuances. That's what made it so much better.

It did have it's fair share of shoot outs and car chases, as well as some nail biting moments as our protagonist had to wait on computer programs while the bad guys were closing in.

Chris Pine, Kiera Knightly, Kenneth Branaugh and Kevin Costner made up an excellent cast.",1434067200,,736,4.444444444444445

5436884,5,B00AIBZMD6,"This is not the original Ryan which makes this work for me very well.  The new has the same history putting him on the path to the CIA, except that it happened in a more recent war.  Even though it is new to Ryan it is faithful in my opinion and the reboot allows leeway to new stories.
Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as always and now I know I like him as a director. I may have seen other movies he directed but don't know.  I am a fan of Chris Pine from Star Trek and People Like Us. I think he is a great pick for a new Jack Ryan and I am hoping they will make this into a serial.  Seeing him as a vulnerable character without confidence in People Like Us made it no surprise for me that he could play someone who is out of their depth with conviction.  Keira Knightley did a great job. None of the dialect slips that I hear from some actors. (Branagh either but then of course he wouldn't slip.) The older Kevin Costner gets the more I like him. He was an excellent casting pick for his roll as Ryan's recruiter and mentor.  Even the predictable things in a spy adventure managed to create suspense in me, which I think is why I gave it 5 stars.  I did some clenching of my teeth so that is props to the director.",1433894400,,1216,4.020746887966805

Admittedly, I don't know who the main character is.  Kevin Costner is in there but he's role is secondary.  Mikhail Baryshnikov plays a bad Russian.  Everybody else, new faces in my book.  Initially, having read Clancy's books and seen the film adaptations, I was thrown off by the distorted chronology; basically, re-inventing the Jack Ryan character to fit into present day events as a young Marine blown to pieces, patched back up, recruited by the CIA as analyst turned field op in a jiffy.  Just threw my arms up in the air and gave up, continued to watch the film.  In the end, it turned out to be a decent spy thriller flick",1433808000,,775,4.569343065693431

Chris plays him at the time he is recruited as an analyst and transitions into operative.

The movie should have been 20-25 minutes longer.  Everything built to the Falling Action very well, but the conflict was resolved too quickly and handily.  Probably the exec prods were breathing down the necks of the director and editor, and they simply threw up their hands and said ""fine, you want it under 1:45, HERE YOU GO!""",1433721600,,505,4.848837209302325

It's a workmanlike thriller with an evil Russian plotting to avenge a personal tragedy by bringing down the American economy through a terrorist attack and large-scale currency manipulation, with Jack ""I'm not a field agent"" Ryan inexplicably called upon by whatever agency it is to put his and his sweetie's all on the line for the free world. Chris Pine of Star Trek fame, and the delectable Keira Knightly are credible, and Kenneth Branaugh directs and plays the evil Russian. (I loved Branaugh in his costume-drama-with-Emma-Thompson phase; since then, he's good but predictable...) Also with Kevin Costner and others.

They could have made the girlfriend, Cathy Muller, less grating (I'm ambivalent toward Keira Knightley but I think she did a good job playing a burdensome character). All that was one-star material, two-star at best. The action sequences were solid three-star footage as were the performances by Kevin Costner and Kenneth Branagh. But what really elevates the show to four stars is the concept of taking down a country by sabotaging its economy. Clever, believable, well executed, and a refreshing twist to the action genre.",1433203200,,688,5.263636363636364

That said, I am a Tom Clancy purist and this ""reboot"" of Jack Ryan, his CIA roll and his enemies, was rather tough to swallow hook, line and sinker.

It's the same problem that Mission Impossible movies have.  Lots of action but not much sophistication in the story.  Nothing like the more cerebral movies like Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger.  It was as if they took some generic action thriller and just dropped in a couple of familiar characters to grab the audience attention.  Disappointing.",1432944000,,482,4.690476190476191

I thought he was going to take the dog back.  Did he leave him bus fare?  How did Jack Ryan develop all those amazing analytical skills?  What happened?

The plot has to do with international finance and the US economy, and its always intriguing. Ryan risks his life for every piece of intel that he collects. Nothing comes easy. When he does learn something, it spins the action in a new direction which always seems to be for the worse.  What really makes this plot work is the action, and there is plenty.  US Marine Ryan is a Wall Street analyst and an undercover CIA analyst. He goes to Russia to carry out an audit on some Russian companies and finds himself thrust into a world of violence and deception. Suddenly, Jack Ryan, the CIA analyst who signed up for a desk job, becomes Jack Ryan the Marine/CIA field agent. Theres plenty of action and its well done.  --Roger Weston, author of The Recruiter",1429660800,2,849,4.565789473684211

5437842,2,B00AIBZMD6,"This reboot did a disservice to a once great franchise. Not that the Ben Affleck reboot was much better, but at least it made some effort to try and live up to and co-exists with the earlier Jack Ryan films (albeit falling short in energy, writing, casting, and directing). This new film, however, feels almost amateur at every turn. It not only fails to engage with the rich DNA of the franchise, but fails to even meet the fairly forgiving bar of an entertaining stand-alone intrigue/action flick. The premise of the story had some potential to work, but was flawed in the details and doesn't manage to feel compelling for most of the movie. Editing and story flow at times felt as though several scenes of potentially enriching narrative development had been cut out. The love story was weakly presented and developed, and it does not feel like you are watching the origin story of the same couple we came to know in ""Patriot Games"". Most of the dialog was shallow and forced (especially the recruitment and mentoring scenes with Kevin Costner's character), and the non-verbal acting that was clearly intended to carry certain ""emotionally intense"" scenes was very poorly directed, if not badly acted as well. There were a couple of scenes between the main characters and the villain that did create some energy, tension, and modest intrigue, but these moments aren't enough to lift the rest of the movie out of its wealth of insufficiency. I give it two stars only on the merits of the casting, which I believe actually could have worked fairly well with better story crafting, dialog, and directing. Perhaps Hollywood can try a third reboot someday... plenty of Jack Ryan stories to be told... But unless the next effort is massively better crafted in the best traditions of the franchise, then we may as well leave the original three films to live on without further blemish.",1429574400,,1881,4.826625386996904

5437879,1,B00AIBZMD6,This movie is a total farce based on the brilliant works of Tom Clancy.  In fact if Clancy were alive he would not have allowed this convoluted story to go to a screenwriter.  First the actor playing Ryan is 30 years too young.  The story takes place in 2013 10 years after Ryan is hurt in Afghanistan.  Impossible as Jack Ryan had already been injured in the marine corps and had a wife and one child in 1986.  It was bad enough when Afflack was cast as Ryan and was also 30 years to young in a Sum of All Fears.  A disgrace to the memory and brilliant writing of Clancy.  If fact I wonder if they had permission/had bought the rights from the Clancy estate before making this sham?,1429488000,,683,4.207692307692308

It's hard to forget the books when you're watching the movie. I'd say if you'd never read the books this is a good stand alone cia thriller involving Russian villains. Kenneth branagh directed and over acts as the villain. Chris pine is at first believable then a bit too polished for an ops newbie. Keira knightley is very good as Cathy, soon to be Cathy Ryan. Surprisingly, the best played role is by Kevin Costner, but again, this is not Ryan's mentor from the books. I watched it free on Prime so it was definitely worth the price. Even if you pay full rental price I think you'll feel you got your money's worth. I wouldnt own it however.",1428710400,,821,4.303225806451613

Pretty boy spy uncovers Russian attempt to wreck world financial system and is sent to Moscow.  Despite being married to Keira Knightly, he spends a lot of time away from her.  In Mother Russia, the GRU are clever, but not clever enough to spot American surveillance vehicle that shows up everywhere.  They also apparently have absolutely no capability to monitor communications from this vehicle.  They also don't recognize Kevin Costner even though they probably watched ""Dances with Wolves,"" so you have to wonder how they think they can take over the world financial system, especially when the Chinese are doing it for real these days.

Weird, out-of-place shots are sprinkled throughout to pull you right out of the movie to say ""What the hell was that?"", the stunt choreography felt amateurish, these poor, big name actors are fighting to hold up this lame script adapted from a story by a lamer author, and you're left scratching your head as to how in the heck a mild-mannered forensic accountant suddenly becomes a super-spy.

5438412,4,B00AIBZMD6,"The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the plot line is complicated, with a lot of different characters to keep straight, which is further complicated by the fact that half the cast is Russian so the names do not get remembered easily.  Once the story was made clear, however, it was a very well acted movie.  The scene in which Ryan kills his first man was well acted with an appropriately believeable level of surprise and horror.  Also, oddly enough I found that I believed the unexpected appearance of Ryan's wife at the hotel was just the type of thing a wife who suspected her husband of cheating might do.  Annoying, but true.  I did enjoy this movie once I had everyone sorted out.",1427500800,,697,4.4140625

5438598,3,B00AIBZMD6,"Keira Knightley is just awful, just ridiculously dreadful, but then she is terrible in everything she is in. (Why does she keep getting acting roles?) Plus, her character (sure, right, she's a 'doctor') is nagging, suspicious, and controlling and any man  involved with her would have dumped her long ago, unless spying on your partner and 'surprising' him by showing up in his hotel room halfway across the world is supposed to be endearing?

Chris Pine is just not a good enough actor to pull this off, not tough enough, he is too much of a lightweight and always comes off like a spoiled prep school brat.

Kenneth Branagh was good and fun to watch as the Russian bad guy, so that is something.

The plot? It is fine for what it is, car chases, things blowing up, no problem with that.

Let's call it a 'home with the flu' kind of movie and, except for Keira Knightley, who is annoying in every scene, it is not bad, especially since it was streamed, so I didn't pay any extra for it.",1427068800,,987,4.430939226519337

5438670,5,B00AIBZMD6,Better than the other Jack Ryan Movie.  Would like to see a series of these.,1426896000,,76,4.066666666666666
5438671,5,B00AIBZMD6,"The primary story arc for Jack Ryan is actually a threat to contemporary America.  Hopefully in the future we elect leaders that change that but it will take a while.  The movie also has a compelling romance between the main character and his fiancee.  Kevin Costner plays the team leader that recruits Jack and invests a great deal of training and tax payer money into him.

The way the director/producer conveyed the three different time periods is put this movie over the top for 5/5 stars from me.  The romance story arc advances and evolves through all three snapshots in time.  This alone made it easier for me to suspend my disbelief and immerse myself into the story.

The threat that the US faces in the movie is real;  However, the fallout that Jack Ryan explains is overly dramatic and fatalistic.  America can easily recover from a second great depression, just as soon as we elect people into office that will remove and shrink government from meddling and choking economic success.  I mean to suggest that America's recovery would occur, but would probably take longer than China and Russia.

I hope they continue the a sequel that explores the romance further and a different threat.  It is nice to see a hero that overcomes obstacles.  I also enjoy how Ms. Knightley's character pushes Jack to grow and evolve, and vice versa.

I despise stories that leaves the hero 'protecting' the love interest by removing her from 'danger'.  Romance is about sharing and facing the future together instead of apart.  So my final prayer is that Ms. Knightley's character is brought into and trained by the C.I.A. in a future sequel.  Growing and advancing Mr. and Mrs. Ryan's family is a beginning instead of an end.",1426809600,,1719,4.772881355932204
5438672,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Okay.  Its almost all true what has already been said about Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit;  clich after clich, etc.  Predictable?  You betcha. Its all been done before and done better.  Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is a shadow clone of the James Bond variety with Chris Pine as the secret agent (okay, hes a CIA analyst/operator) and Kevin Costner as his M controller.  The plot is fundamentally ridiculous and full of holes so large that you could you could drive a stealth bomber through it, but I still liked it.  In spite of its ridiculousness, I enjoyed it enough that Ive actually watched it twice.  Admittedly, I enjoyed it a little less the second time through, but I was still able to stick with it all the way through.  Pine is fine as is Costner and Branaugh.  I found Knightleys performance far less interesting or convincing, but given the fact that she didn't really have a lot to do, Ill give her a pass.  Bottom line is I've given it 4 stars in spite of its many flaws simply because it provides some good old action and entertainment and the acting is really pretty decent in spite of the silly plot and abundant absurdities.  Would I recommend it to others?  Not necessarily.  This is one that youll definitely have to decide on for yourself.

I did not like the time acceleration in the last 1/4 of the film.

5438903,4,B00AIBZMD6,"I've only read two Tom Clancy books - Without Remorse and The Hunt for Red October, to be precise - but this movie feels very Tom Clancy. It has that gritty, on-the-ground feeling when depicting a financial attack that, under extremely favorable and very unlikely circumstances in reality, may actually happen. Seriously, dumping a whole lot of US dollar into global financial market is no joke, and as an economic major college student I can appreciate the story acknowledge that. On the other hand, I also like what the movie is trying to say, that sometimes we still need to do the thing the old-school way with field agents to get things done.

The rest is simple. The plot is relatively straight forward, the acting is solid and the filmography is as good as one could expect. It feels like a Jason Bourne movie with less fighting and more, well, brain. I'd like to see a sequel to this and watch how it goes. I like this version of Jack Ryan.",1426291200,,948,4.543859649122807

5439043,4,B00AIBZMD6,"Shadow Recruit is like trying on a new James Bond, I had to get comfortable with a new Jack Ryan, but Chris Pine did an excellent job in quickly filling the role. The story flows well and I was impressed to see how Ryan was recruited by the CIA. I thought casting was well done with Kevin Costner's role as the recruiter and handler of the young Ryan being an excellent anchoring choice.  The action adventure scenes started quickly and did not disappoint.  The special effects, fight scenes, explosions, chases and crashes were all well done. Shadow Recruit was exactly what I wanted...good action adventure entertainment.  If you are a Bond, Reacher, Bosh or Haller you will enjoy this movie.",1425945600,,694,4.766666666666667

5439535,3,B00AIBZMD6,"SPOILERS(kinda....)  Watch the movie, then read.(MUHUWAHAHA!  They're going to forget to READ!)

As a John Patrick Ryan movie, I'd say, ""Great!  Really exciting!  It's just too bad that JPR has become Jason Bourne."".  I'd moreover like to say, ""Yeah, but the book was better..."", but that ain't gonna happen in this scenario (I could be wrong, need to check if Clancy DID write a book before this movie came out).
Let's see,
I think the crew chief of the Huey JPR was in would have made sure all the jarheads on the bird were strapped in right......

Cathy Ryan wouldn't be so frail and half-witted as to chase a man (and yes that includes the ONE TRUE LOVE in JPR) around the world to make sure he wasn't cheating on her.  More like she'd let it go, and made sure that before, if ever, JPR wanted back in, he'd have to lick her boots (among other things) and confess as if he would to his GOD, and LORD, help him if he were to lie (note that her little ""acid test"" about the movie actually failed, cuz he never answered the question).

As far as I can tell, JPR only lets people he likes call him ""Jack"".  But then again, THIS IS A MOVIE, not the books.

That part when JPR ""speed analyzes"" stuff, is just bourne-ish to be believed.

OH, NO,  memory data fading, corruption progressing at 5% per 30 seconds (wait, wouldn't that be like 10% a minute?)  MUST TRY TO FINISH.....

I say ""The Hunt For Red October"", was still the best JPR movie, and Alec Baldwin the best Jack Ryan.  Yeah, I like Harrison Ford, but not so much as JPR, though he was good.

So, what?  Did they not want to pay for an Admiral Greer, and the coolest badass John Clark (Kelly) in the same film, so they put them in a blender, and came up with this Kevin Costner driven Thomas Harper character? (OO,OOO!  Bye the by, notice that one of the exec producers name is TOMMY Harper?  OMG, where'd they get the character names?)

AHHHH, I've cooled off, so let me end by saying it was a good film, and I was on the edge of my seat, like a lot of you (but I fell off, TWICE!) and would recommend it to anyone asking, but as a JPR movie?  It's O.K.  (READ ""Sum of All Fears"", and you'll see how good Clancy screws with JPR's world).",1425686400,,2198,4.243373493975904

As they try to escape from the most powerful man in Russia as he soft captures her by way of a stern walk, they ecape by way of a chance encounter PDA hug which we are to believe is enough to dissuade the gang of goons who just spent 10 minutes shooting all over Moscow(and soon to be the next 20 minutes) from simply apprehending them on the spot.
