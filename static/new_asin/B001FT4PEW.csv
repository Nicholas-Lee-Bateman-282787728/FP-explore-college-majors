3589060,5,B001FT4PEW,"CBS/Paramount has done a fine job in this release of the second season of Mannix.  The episodes have been nicely restored--in fact they are pristine. As far as the show's premise--by season two, the producers changed the format from the unsustainable premise of the first season---namely Mannix working for a large detective agency, but bucking the system and his organization in each and every episode. By season two, he is out on his own as a P.I.  The production values were very high for the 1960's and Los Angeles of that era is nicely showcased.  The plots are clever, well written and well paced.  In fact, there was such an improvement from first season--that the format stayed essentially intact for the remainder of the series.

I heartily recommend!",1232064000,7,760,4.90625

3589063,4,B001FT4PEW,"After the beautiful, extras-packed Season One ""Mannix"" collection, I was surprised to find ""Mannix: The Second Season"" was no-frills all the way, from the slender plastic case, to a lack of any special features. Surprised and disappointed, as, in many ways, this is the first 'true' season of ""Mannix"" (with Intertect gone, and Joe Mannix the traditional private eye he'd remain for the rest of the series' run, complete with sweet, wise secretary, Peggy, brilliantly portrayed by Gail Fisher, and the first...and best...of his police department buddies, Larry ""M.A.S.H."" Linville and Robert ""The Brady Bunch"" Reed). As Connors had spoken glowingly of Fisher in the earlier collection, I had been looking forward to more of his anecdotes and memories, but, sadly, all that is offered are the episodes.

Not that the episodes disappoint...This is ""Mannix"", after all! Ruggedly handsome, loyal to a fault, he is a hero frequently roughed-up and shot, but never defeated, the 'Bogie' of the '60s TV generation, complete with a gun, cigarettes, a gas-guzzling car (and car phone), and those amazing sports jackets...

So cheers to the Second Season...and hopes for more extras, in future collections!",1231372800,8,1196,5.2894736842105265

3589065,5,B001FT4PEW,"For me, this was the real start of the Mannix I remember, altho I am a Joseph Campanella fan. The thing that struck me was how advanced for its time this series was in the respect of African Americans. Not only Peggy Fisher...they had a real, relaxed relationship with a subdued sexual chemistry thrown in...but minorities were everywhere in this series; as guest stars, as extras. They were scientists, college educated, domestic workers too. There was physical touching between the races...laugh, but this was really unusual back then. The dialogue and relationships were real and comfortable, not forced. In 'Last Rites for Miss Emma' when Peggy accuses Joe of siding with white people..""Of course not. They're white""...that was bold and realistic. This was a 1st class show with 1st class production values. I wish the releases of this series didn't take a whole year (are you Listening Paramount?)

3589066,5,B001FT4PEW,"Mannix, starring Mike Connors, was one of television's greatest private eyes. Only Tom Selleck's Thomas Magnum and James Garner's Jim Rockford would seem to be in the same category as far as popularity, durability, and enjoyment. Forged in the tough, hardboiled tradition of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, Mannix brought these novelists' archtypes to the small screen - beaten up, beats up, lied to, and tied up. But he endured for eight seasons.

The second season is the era of the show that Mannix is best remember for - his cool house, office, and girl Friday Peggy Fair. The first season of the show saw Mannix work not for himself, but a detective agency that used the first type of computers to solve crimes, and Mannix was seen as a dinosaur who was doing things the old fashioned way. The second season follows the pattern that most fans remember and cherish.

This series is one I've been waiting for forever. For all of us who grew up admiring him as THE private eye before Rockford and Magnum came on the scene, it's high time that this was released on DVD.",1221436800,5,1077,4.663157894736842

The combination Mike Conners acting, well written scripts, bruce geller's production team and Lalo Schifrin's great theme and score make mannix a must have for any serious collection of great 1960's crime dramas. I bought season 1 for 39.95 retail and it was worth it . The video capture and sound is excellent and even though cbs sent it out with plain silver disks and compact case it doesnt detract from a great fun clasic series and I cant wait to get season 2. Its great fun just buy it",1221350400,6,557,4.365384615384615
3589068,5,B001FT4PEW,"Great news for Classic TV fans!

CBS Paramount Home Video is quickly following the successful release of Season 1 of the iconic TV series 'Mannix' on DVD with the release of the complete Season 2!

Great news: CBS Parmount Home Video has also annouced that ALL of the ORIGINAL musical score and cues for every episode has been included and not replaced! (They had been sharply criticized by fans for replacing some of the music in Season 2 of the Fugitive.)

Mannix ran from 1967 through 1975 on CBS. Created by Richard Levinson and William Link and developed by executive producer Bruce Geller (who also created Mission: Impossible), the title character, Joe Mannix, is a two-fisted private investigator portrayed by Mike Connors.

Rarely has an actor so inhabited a TV character that it's impossible to separate the two. This series represents one of those times, and even the show's producers recognized it when the unusual credit proclaimed: Mike Connors IS Mannix.

The ruggedly handsome Connors was the perfect match, and made the signature loud polyester sports jackets of the time look great on his altar ego. Mannix also drove a variety of convertibles, and even had a car phone - which was unheard of at the time!

Mannix originally worked for a high-concept computerized firm known as Intertect in the rarely seen first season. In the second season, Mannix has left the firm and opened his own private investigative agency at 17 Paseo Verde, Los Angeles, California.

It was in the second season that the brilliant and popular actress Gail Fisher was brought on board as Mannix's devoted secretary, Peggy Fair. Peggy's cop-husband, a friend of Mannix, had been killed in line of duty. She is now a widowned mom to young son Toby, portrayed by Mark Stewart, who is still coping with the loss of his father.

Fisher, one of the first African-American actresses to have a regular TV series role, portrayed the character from 1968 through the run of the show.

Connors, very proud of his Armenian heritage and spoke fluent Armenian and French, incorporated his background into Mannix's character, even putting several Armenian proverbs into the episodes including, ""There is no reason for war that reasonable men cannot resolve."" Connors was also a Korean War veteran - and so was Mannix!

Joseph Campanella, who portrayed Mannix's boss Lew Wickersham, in Season 1, reprised his role in Season 2, but was no longer his boss, but instead offered computer assistance and friendship when Mannix needed it.

As a solo P.I., Mannix was also assisted by members of the police department. The two most prominent officers were Lt. Adam Tobias (portrayed by Robert Reed, prior to his Brady Bunch days when he starred with Florence Henderson as the parents), and Lt. Art Malcolm (portrayed by Ward Wood). Both characters premiered in Season 2, Reed in `A Copy of Murder,' and Wood in `End Game.' Other police contacts were Lt. George Kramer (Larry Linville of M*A*S*H* fame) and Lt. Dan Ives (Jack Ging).

Often criticized for its violence, it nonetheless remains a fan favorite to this day and a ratings winner it aired. Over the eight seasons of the series, Mannix was knocked unconscious 55 times and shot 17 times.

All 25 episodes of Season 2 are included in this boxed set and are: `The Silent Cry,' Mannix chases kidnappers with the assistance of a deaf girl who lip read the plot of the crime; `Comes Up Roses,' Mannix fights a conspiracy of silence to find Rose Anderson, who was swallowed up by the underground she deserted; `Pressure Point,' Mannix's clues to court corruption were a few words gasped by a badly beaten man; `To the Swiftest, Death,' Mannix probes a race-car accident that killed an aerospace engineer; `End of the Rainbow,' Mannix probes the mysterious death of a recently released prison inmate who carried a scrap of paper with his name on it; `A Copy of Murder,' a manuscript gone missing holds the answer to a homicide; `Edge of the Knife,' kidnappers threaten to kill a doctor's son unless the surgeon lets a patient die on the operating table; `Who Will Dig the Graves?' revelations await Mannix in his search for a millionaire's wife; `In Need of a Friend,' Mannix finds new evidence in the case of an embezzler he helped convict; `Night Out of Time,' the likelihood that a young man killed a girl grows stronger as Mannix reconstructs the previous evening for him; `A View of Nowhere,' on a helicopter trip, Mannix thinks he sees a murder below; `Fear I to Fall; Death Run,' Mannix is called to testify against an ex-con he sent up, but this time suspects a frame; `A Pittance of Faith,' an old friend asks Mannix for help, but when he arrives at the man's rural town, he finds murder; `Only Giants Can Play,' Mannix takes a murder investigation into the political arena; `Shadow of a Man,' Mannix tries to unravel a war hero's past in order to find out why he is being targeted for death; `The Girl Who Came in with the Tide,' Mannix believes a drowning victim was murdered; `Death in a Minor Key,' an enigmatic police chief, a bigoted witness and an interloper thwart Mannix's search for Peggy's boyfriend; `End Game,' a court-martialed veteran seeks revenge against Mannix and a policeman, the last survivors of his combat unit; `All Around the Money Tree,' Mannix is lured to Mexico; `The Odds Against Donald Jordan,' Mannix is hired to locate a missing building contractor; `Last Rites for Miss Emma,' Mannix faces the loss of the friendship of Peggy Fair when he tells her that he suspects her new boyfriend of being the key man in the theft of 45 cartons of morphine; `The Solid Gold Web,' a newspaper publisher's daughter is implicated in the death of a mobster; `Merry Go Round for Murder,' a boarding school marked for demolition sets off a mystery; and `To Catch a Rabbit,' a bitter murder suspect claims the death was accidental.

Guest stars in Season 2 read like a `who's who' of the best actors and actresses from the era. Included are: Cloris Leachman, William Windom, Barbara Rush, Barbara Babcock, Gerald S. O'Laughlin, Harold J. Stone, Hugh Beaumont, Peter Haskell, Jill Ireland, Kathryn Hays, Ford Rainey, Eve Plumb, Fritz Weaver, Geraldine Brooks, Harry Dean Stanton, John Colicos, John Considine, Dana Elcar, Madlyn Rhue, Peter Donat, Patricia Barry, Philip Ahn, Yaphet Kotto, Anthony Zerbe, Steve Ihnat, Paul Winfield, and Sally Kellerman.

It's great to have Season 2 released so quickly after Season 1. Let's hope the remaining seasons follow suit.",1221004800,53,6506,4.880434782608695

3589070,5,B001FT4PEW,"Anyone old enough, will appreciate Joe Mannix and this set of DVDs. The DVD production values are top notch and razor crisp. The plots were better than average, and Joe always did good job tracking down the baddies. Plenty of plot twists too. The show takes a new direction from season one with Mannix heading out on his own with his award winning secretary. Anyone not old enough for the nostalgia factor, may not be into this. Bruce Geller knows how to make great TV, and two of the greatest theme songs in the history of TV, with Mission Impossible being the other. I watch a couple episodes and I'm humming that darn tune all day.

The cases he is involved in range from kidnapping, killing to international espionage, armed robbery , political scandals and syndicate and mafia conections. He is always a tough guy who is up to the task no matter how hard it may be. There is a lot of car chasing, bunching, shooting, explosions and flying as Mannix also was licensed as a pilot. To sum it up , Mannix deserved to win the Emmy awards and the Golden globes that he won for the series. Mannix was also one of the  most decent and clean detective series with sometimes strong moral elements, not like the trash that is being given to us on TV nowadays.

3589095,4,B001FT4PEW,"Mike Connors returns as private detective Joe Mannix.  The big thing about the second season (1968-69) is that the investigator has left Intertech, the firm he was working for in the initial season, and is out his own, with the wonderful Gail Fisher (1935-2000) as his loyal secretary Peggy Fair.  Created by Richard Levinson and William Link (Columbo, Ellery Queen Mysteries, Murder She Wrote), and developed by Bruce Geller (Mission Impossible) the show has good production values, features great locations, and a solid selection of guest stars.  Like Mission Impossible, Mannix has a terrific theme by Lalo Schifrin.

Joe Mannix is an extremely confident and likeable guy, that people readily putting their trust in.  He's handsome, intelligent, street tough, and quick with his fists.  In tight with the local police, Mannix utilizes networking, as well as his keen investigative skills to get the job done.  While violence and murder was fairly typical at the time, Mannix is probably less violent than the crime dramas that would follow in the 70's.  Although the body count may be a bit low, it is still a program where fists fly, people are assaulted, and gunfire can break out at any time.  Mannix is a fairly good shot, though he rarely seems to aim his snub nosed revolver.

Coming up with fresh ideas in the private detective genre was a challenge even back then, and although there are some misfires, the writers do mostly a commendable job, providing a variety of cases for Mannix to take on.  Like most good investigators, Mannix follows his hunches, and isn't motivated just by profit, which provides opportunities to take the character to new places.  It may be hard to believe today, but having a black actress in a series was a big deal in 1968, and like Connors, Gail Fisher is also extremely likeable, and Peggy is treated as an equal.

Highlights in season two include, `The End of the Rainbow' where a dead man with Mannix's phone number leads Joe into a web of deceit, tangling with a gang of crooks on the trail of millions.  In a stylistic and quite provocative scene for television, Joe takes a beating in a club, while a dancer does her thing on the bar.  In `A View of Nowhere', Mannix sees what looks like an assault on a rooftop while cruising by in a helicopter.  This leads to a most ingenious and twisted scheme.  An old friend asks Joe for help in `Deathrun', where Mannix takes a trip to the mountains, and ends up in the middle of an insidious plot.  Peggy falls for a man who is wounded during a robbery, in `Last Rites For Miss Emma'.  Unfortunately Joe suspects Peggy's new friend, be may be involved in the theft of a load of drugs.

Operating with intelligence and a cool sense of style, Mannix paved the way for the explosion of private detective shows that would follow in the years to come.  The second season sets the mold for the years that would follow, with some solid stories, heavy hitting action, and a few sensitive moments that touch the heart.  Image quality is very good, for the 25 episodes on six discs, but unfortunately there are no extras or subtitling.  It remains a pricey set, but Mannix is a series that is well worth checking out.",1313280000,2,3196,4.677996422182469

After picking it up and checking it anew, I was pleasantly surprised that it was even a better show than I remembered. My wife, who had never seen it as she is younger than I, also became a fan while watching. The show is simple, direct, solid, and consistantly entertaining - no wonder it was on from 1967 to 1975 (tho I only watched the first 3 seasons before my social life precluded future viewing). Rarely has an actor so immersed himself in a TV character that it's impossible to separate the two. This series represents one of those times, Mike Connors was Mannix, make no mistake about it... Lots of violence, great big old American cars, miniskirts and big hair aplenty on the actresses, tons of drinking done during the day, everyone smoking cigarettes - we were genetically stronger and had much thicker skin in those days, and didn`t blame society or our parents for our shortcomings and weaknesses.

3589103,5,B001FT4PEW,"Tough, cool loners don't answer to anyone except themselves, and that's the Mannix way. Go it alone. Be tough. Be smart. And, most importantly of all, be honest, brutally honest. The chicks all dig you, but chicks are a dime a dozen, and besides, you've got things to do. You've got a crime to solve. You've got a mystery to unravel. You've got a bullet to dodge. There are bad guys who think they can handle you, but you make them think about it a whole lot harder. The bad guys end up changing their minds, but you never change yours. You believe in yourself. You believe in the truth. You believe in helping good, honest people and turning dishonest people upside down. Your tough, never-say-die nature was made even tougher in the Korean War. You served your country. You came home a hero. And the hero in you found himself a new mission. Your new mission: be tough, be cool, be Mannix!

If you're familiar with the show, all you really need to know is that the DVD's do the show proud. They have great picture quality and include all the episodes of season two with the awesome and beautiful Peggy. No special features, and that's a shame, but the show is as it should be: unedited and right at our fingertips. Bring on season 3.",1241740800,9,1234,4.436123348017621
3589104,4,B001FT4PEW,"The first season of Mannix, as I wrote in a review of that DVD, was a major disappointment and did not resemble the popular private eye series that was so popular it lasted many seasons. Fortunately, when Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts became the producers in the second season, they jettisoned the unsuccessful high-tec ""Intertect"" connection that held the concept back and the series developed the popular format of the ""man-of-integrity"" and ""heart-of-gold"" private detective that will do anything to assure that justice is done, wrong is righted and money is not the most important thing.
There are numerous episodes that put you on the edge of your seat, but I am only giving the series four stars because there is a problem with many of the scripts in that the writers didn't seem to know how to have Mannix carry out ordinary sleuthing and that clues suddenly, miraculously drop into Mannix's lap. In several episides, witnesses happen to notice what the license plate number on a car was that they happened to glimpse. How many people really notice license plate numbers of cars they see? Come on!
On the positive side, there is a truly outstanding episode called ""Endgame"" which I think is one of the finest hours of television ever produced. It's guest star is Steven Ihnat, one of the best character actors of his time (he tragically died quite young) and he plays a former POW who was held in a North Korean prison camp along with Mannix and the entire episode is a very tense, life-or-death confrontation between the two men.  The director of the episode is one of my favorites, John Moxey, who is an expert at using complex sets (this episode takes place in a large abanonded building that Ihnat's character has put explosive devices in) to give the viewer a powerful visual experience along with the  enthralling acting.  It is stories like this one that made Mannix the popular series it became.",1240963200,5,1906,4.787234042553192
3589105,5,B001FT4PEW,"We have enjoyed seeing Mannix Season 1 and 2. We have always loved the show. Now that it is 41 years old it is great to see it again. I can't believe network Television won't rerun this fabulous show anymore. Watching TV Land is a joke, all they do is self promote themselves with their own commerical's - all the classic TV shows are chopped and edited to the point we stopped watching and started buying old Tv Shows on DVD.

Mannix has all those beautiful old cars when American Iron ruled the road and Japanese cars were still in Japan where they belong! We get a kick out of the spiffy Petrocelli & Botany 500 Suits and Sport coats. Mannix was a sharp dresser.

We love seeing what the Los Angeles area and California State looked like before the building boom. The music is great. Lalo Schifrin's original Mannix Soundtrack has been re-released. There is a newer 1999 version of the Mannix soundtrack where all the songs were re-recorded for a more 90's Jazz sound.

We can hardly wait for season 3,4,5,6,7,8....Some more interviews with the survivng cast members & guests would be great while they are still alive.",1239840000,3,1121,4.595

3589108,5,B001FT4PEW,"Being a kid growing up in the 60s I have always felt that Mannix is the greatest detective show, if not best television show period, of all times.  I have season one and two and love them both.  (I also have the Lalo Schifrin CD of Mannix music.  Love it!)  On the negative side though, I was a little disappointed that there are no commentaries or extras at all on the second season.  That was a nice plus to season one.  On the positive side the quality of the picture is fantastic.  Season one looks good but somehow season two is unreal.  We have a 46"" flat screen tv and blue ray player so the combination makes season two a true thrill to watch.  In addition I feel that the stories are better than season one and the acting by Connors and his guest starts is better as well.  I almost hate to admit it but I actually welled up inside when I started watching the series again.  It really put me back in the 60s as a kid being truly entertained.  I cannot wait for season three but I hope they decide to include the extras.  Keep 'em coming!",1237852800,7,1046,4.17
3589109,5,B001FT4PEW,"Unlike many of you, I had the privilege of viewing the initial season of Mannix in reruns, thanks to a local station.  That was 28 years ago.  And now Paramount has made it possible to enjoy the first and second season of Mannix.

I found it interesting that both Mannix and Mission Impossible underwent changes in their second season.  Mission with its lead man and Mannix with its general format.  Gone are Joe Campanella(to the Bold Ones)and the Intertech computer system, making Joe Mannix his own free agent.  17 Paseo Verde would be the address for the remaining 168 action packed adventures.

Newcomer Peggy Fair, played by the great Gail Fisher, is a welcome breath of fresh air to this series.  There is no token interaction between Mannix and Peggy.  There is sincere, personal dialogue and Peggy is a real individual, not an eye candy receptionist.  Moreover, both Mannix and Peggy share mutual concern for one another's physical and emotional welfare.  Commend producers for the then daring move of blending business principle with subdued physical and sexual attraction between Joe and Peggy.  This element of the show did not seem to deter its core audience, since Mannix ranked in the top 20 throughout its run.

The second season produced some wonderful and enriching episodes.  Viewers, notice the number of well written episodes at a time when Mannix filmed 24-25 episodes per season.  A litany of series produced during the late 60s often filmed 26 or more episodes per season.  Today's writers work with a 22 episode schedule and still struggle to give you an intelligent or entertaining script.  Mannix maintained good production values (despite the persistent bows to the Paramount sets), great directing, wonderful use of colors, and famous actors in each episode.
The producers were willing to spend money for Mannix and it showed.

In addition, Mike Connors did many of his own stunts.  Reverse or slow down your DVD to a moment where stuntwork was required.  The face clearly belongs to Mike Connors, who was quite an athlete for his time.  Imagine how a serious injury to Connors would have held up production for weeks, if not months!

For those of you who lived in Southern California during the Mannix years, you might be pleasantly surprised to see segments of episodes filmed in your hometown.  I know that Mannix filmed a number of episodes by our old family house in Oxnard.  It is a treat for me to compare the retro Oxnard on Mannix to the revamped Oxnard I currently reside in.  Markedly different.

My only regret is that Paramount did not make an effort to produce bonus features for this offering.  That would be the only demerit, if any, to this season 2 compilation.  But all in all, if you like frame ups, fist fights, gunfights, screeching cars, kidnapping plots, embittered war buddies, and twisted ex girl friends, 17 Paseo Verde is the place to be.",1236384000,9,2895,4.865030674846626
3589110,5,B001FT4PEW,"I was a kid when Mannix was originally on TV, but I remembered thinking Joe was cute and Peggy was cool (!) so I ordered the 2nd season. Wow! This series still holds up 40+years later.  I really enjoyed each episode. I admired how smart and progressive the writting was for that era concerning race and that Peggy wasn't written as a bimbo. The chemistry between Mike Connors and Gail Fisher is great.  While it was obviously filmed entirely on the Paramount lot (you will recognize many Murder, She Wrote and MASH locations), the stories and acting make that fact moot.  I plan to buy each new season as soon as they are released. I'm a renewed Mannix fan!",1235347200,4,657,4.504201680672269

3589112,4,B001FT4PEW,"Just a few notes of Lalo Schiffrin's seductive theme song for Mannix and I'm transported right back to my early teens in SoCal. I'd forgotten how much I really loved this show until I stumbled upon this set. The series holds up surprisingly well in terms of story and acting; Mike Connors is enjoyably charismatic and sexy as independent, two-fisted PI-with-a-heart Joe Mannix. Plenty of familiar faces from 1960s TV Land appear as guest stars. Although the same studio backlots and painted backgrounds can get tiresome, each episode does manage break out of the studio for location shooting and that's when things perk right up.

The time-warp aspects of the series are lots of fun, even the not-so-positive ones. I had forgotten how much Mannix smokes, though less than in Season 1. The fashions are a scream, not just miniskirts and go-go boots for women but also pointy bras, big hair and ever-present fake eyelashes. The mini-skirts we all wore back then look somehow startling today, especially when worn by very professional women such as the sublime actress Gail Fisher, who played Mannix's plucky secretary. (How quaint that he calls her ""Peggy"" or ""Honey"" and she calls him ""Mr. Mannix."")

Mannix shows up in some pretty hideous sports coats (some of which cause the dreaded pulsing ""moir"" effect on the screen), not to mention ankle-baring tight slacks and the occasional foppish neck scarf (ouch!). And it's fun to watch his hair color get blacker and blacker--but that front curl never gets mussed. However, Mike Connors is such a watchable actor that all of that stuff is simply amusing, not distracting.

Vintage muscle-car lovers, take note: Mannix has got the goods, with plenty of car chases. All the great land yachts of the late 1960s are on full display as everyday transportation (I spotted a gas sign advertising 33 cents a gallon--sigh). I particularly enjoy seeing the occasional 1967 Ford Galaxie 500, since that was our family chariot. Simpler times indeed.

This second season is far superior to Season 1, though I miss seeing Joseph Campanella, who played Mannix's boss the first year (his brother Frank shows up as a police captain in Season 2). Let's hope more seasons are in the pipeline!",1234742400,15,2220,4.959677419354839

3589115,5,B001FT4PEW,"It is hard to add much more praise on this great series than already has but here goes. First I never missed this show as a child growing up, I watched it with my dad every Saturday night. It was the only night of the week I could stay up until 11:00pm. The first thing that strikes me as I watch the show 40 years later is how shows of this era tried to appeal to the best in human nature. Loyalty, integrity, honesty, sense of justice, and in Mannix case genuinely caring about many of the clients he was trying to help. Compare that to most shows of today that wallow in the worst of human nature even glorify it. I probably will never get a chance to meet Mick Connors or another hero of my youth James Arness of Gunsmoke but would like to thank them for helping to make a positive lasting impression on a little boy so many years ago. I highly recommend this dvd set.  Thanks Joe !",1233273600,34,886,4.121387283236994
3589116,5,B001FT4PEW,"I've always been a Mannix fan so, I really liked season 1... but I have to tell you Season 2 is much better. The story lines have improved with Joe's new address at 17 Paseo Verde. Gail Fisher is not only beautiful... but she can act as well! I couldn't help notice the much better use of cinematography in season 2 that just wasn't there in season 1. The story lines are better and easier to follow and Chrysler supplied the cool cars. Joe drives a dark green Dodge GTS 340 convertible with mag wheels... it's sweet! We can only hope for the release of future seasons! Mike Connors where ever you are... BRAVO!

3589117,5,B001FT4PEW,"When people think of MANNIX it's really the second season on.  As a matter of fact, when the series run ended and it went into syndication the first season was never shown again.  The original ""fish out of water"" premise was abandoned for the more popular hard-nosed, hard-hitting and compasionate private eye.  There was a quality to the tv shows of that era (MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, I SPY, UNCLE, BONANZA, GUNSMOKE, MEDICAL CENTER, HAWAII FIVE-O, et al) that defined them: entertainment.  A few shows over the years have had that quality: THE NIGHT STALKER, THE X-FILES, SUPERNATURAL. Mike Connors IS Mannix and with this season brings Gail Fisher and Peggy Fair, Mannix's secretary.  Great fun.",1233014400,6,694,5.052631578947368
3589118,5,B001FT4PEW,"This show just gets better and better.

I watched this show when I was a young boy, and loved it then. Then it went off the air and I don't recall seeing a re-run since.

When the DVD sets started coming out, I'm snapping them up the instant they're available. Season 1 was great, and this show just gets better; season 2 is great too!

I've discovered, to no great surprise, that most of the shows I liked when I was very young no longer appeal to me. There have been a few exceptions, and the exceptions tend to be simply excellent. Mannix is one of those exceptions. A great show is a great show, no matter the age of the viewer.

Also, Mannix holds up very well despite the unavoidable things that date it, such as car models, hair and clothing styles, a few stories that deal directly with the drug and hippie culture of the late 60's and early 70's, etc. Also, smoking is prevelent throughout, which also dates the show.

I'm holding off sharing Mannix (and Mission Impossible and other old favorites of mine) with my young son (he's 2 now) for no other reason than the on-screen smoking.

That caveat aside, I would recommend this set to anyone who likes great detective/private investigator shows -- it's a classic of the genre.",1232496000,4,1236,4.471111111111111

In Season 2, Mannix was out on his own -- no longer the star investigator for Intertec. He picked up a beautiful secretary, Peggy Fair, played by Gail Fisher.

The mysteries continued to be interesting and often gritty, throwing plenty of curves at the viewer. The stories hold up very well. If you can overlook the lack of cell phones, they could be happening today.
