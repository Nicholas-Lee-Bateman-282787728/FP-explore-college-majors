2715519,5,B000LW7P2I,A classic! Love Chaim Topol!,1418947200,,28,4.8
2715520,5,B000LW7P2I,A delightful funny take on life in Israel as that nations was just learning how to be.  Loved it!  The characters just endear themselves to you.  Great acting!,1415145600,2,159,4.607142857142857
2715521,5,B000LW7P2I,I like owning this classic Israeli films. Makes great points about the challenges of founding Israel. Film is very funny.,1399420800,2,121,5.1
2715522,5,B000LW7P2I,"Third time seeing it and I still loved it.  It encapsulates the maybe stereotypical differences between the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in the beginning of the modern Israeli state, but the flavor is just right.",1398729600,3,212,5.057142857142857
2715523,5,B000LW7P2I,"Despite being a very old B&W movie, this is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. It is also a satire of immigration cultural differences and bureaucracy in the early stater of Israel.",1385078400,,189,4.428571428571429
2715524,4,B000LW7P2I,"This movie reflects the difficulty of adjusting to life in a foreign country. For people who experienced life in the early years of a new state trying to sort out the system, Sallah can be very funny, even though it is quite old. The characters were not really fleshed out, but they clearly represent the stereotyped figures of immigrants from different continents. Ultimately, there is hope for the future in the generation of our children.",1368230400,3,441,4.8933333333333335
2715525,5,B000LW7P2I,"This is a funny film that only someone who has lived in Israel could fully appreciate.  A parody of what it's like trying to find housing in modern day Israel (actually, several decades ago), it shows how everybody votes on a kibbutz, and how nobody is allowed to profit personally on one of these collectives.  It shows the truly frustrating housing shortage which plagued and probably still plagues those that live there.  It also shows the frustration that immigrants have when trying to work according to their training instead of in the farm fields.  Moshe Dayan mentioned this in his autobiography while writing about Ma'alot and its sister Arab town, and I saw it hit the Persian immigrants right in the face in 1979 when they came to Israel fleeing Khoumeni.

This movie also shows the culture clash as Ashkenazi Jewish culture, which took over Israel as it was becoming a state, predominated over the Sephardic and Mizrachi Jewish cultures.  The only real big blooper was that new immigrants from Egypt, Jewish or not, would NOT be speaking modern Israeli Hebrew, but that's the compromise necessary for making a film that Israelis could watch without subtitles.",1357084800,,1171,4.948979591836735
2715526,5,B000LW7P2I,"Chaim Topol, who stars as the ertswhile Sallah Shabati, really brings this movie to life.

And as he does so, he helps tell the humourous side of the story of the founding of the State of Israel, from the perspective of one of its less esteemed emigrees.

He religously avoids work.  He does for the local kibbutz election what the Marx brothers did for opera.  He attempts to secure a payment from his daughter's romantic suitor.

And he even keeps changing the identification placards near a single Israeli tree so that its various donars can all visit (albeit, of course, not at the same time).

Of course, any movie starring Topol invites the inevitable discussion his more noted (and later) role as Tevye the Milk Man in the super famous Fidler on the Roof.  And yes, much like he would do later, he plays beyond his age.

Amazingly, when the movie was made Topol was only 27 years old, something you could just as easily miss here as you could miss it in Fidler.

And yes, much like his later portrayal, Tevye is the quintessential family man, struggling to provide for his large brood, though Shabati obviously lacks Tevye's more obvious work ethic.

However, this is a movie that rightly deserves attention for what it was.  Amazingly, it was made back when there was only one movie camera in the entire State of Israel.  Despite that fact (and other obvious limited resources) this movie went on to score a foreign film Academy Award nomination in 1965.

So don't watch it for Tevye.  Watch it for Sallah and enjoy.",1280534400,7,1524,4.638059701492537
2715527,5,B000LW7P2I,"Among the top 50 Israeli films, this one is likely to appear on everyone's list.  Topol is absolutely hilarious as an incorrigible layabout who is always looking for a (creative) way to avoid work.  For example, many know that donors to Israel are promised a grove or tree in their name. Rather than plant new trees, Topol goes about changing the names assigned to the trees already planted...making sure he gets advance notice of the donors about to visit ""their grove.""  From a serious standpoint, the film does exhibit some of the real problems that immigrants face in adjusting to life in Israel including the poor quality of some of the accomodations.  For fans of Topol, check out some of his other films such as Left Luggage or Galileo.",1177286400,15,743,4.736434108527132
8164655,5,B000LW7P2I,"Supposedly this is super low budget made very shortly after Israel became a state.  A Jewish friend was trying to explain the subtle one upmanship that Jewish society harbours....just as all nations that I am familiar with have caste distintions (I am most familiar with those in the US, GB, and India).  She had never seen movie but I found it a hoot and a half.  The difference between those who can afford morality, and those who have survived by their wits, the idealism of the more fortunate, contrasted by a necessary opportunism makes for an amusing culture clash.  Admittedly  I am a Topol fan, but I don't think you will be disappointed, esp. if you consider the budget and authenticity.",1526083200,,696,4.7190082644628095
8164656,5,B000LW7P2I,"Just a classic of early Israeli comedy, and priceless.  Best for its cultural insight, sublime tongue in cheek humor, truth, and...everything else.",1523923200,,147,5.681818181818182

8164661,3,B000LW7P2I,I got this DVD because of the language and because of the positive reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  It started out very slow and even boring and then turned out to be more amusing as I began to grasp Sallah's humorous side.  I guess it is one of those films you need to watch over and over again to fully appreciate.  I do not regret buying it.,1457913600,2,345,4.119402985074627
8164662,5,B000LW7P2I,First saw this movie many years ago in Israel.  It's a true Israeli classic.  Happy to finally own it.,1449964800,,102,4.315789473684211
