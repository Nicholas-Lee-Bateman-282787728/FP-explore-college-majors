3964318,3,B002PCKX0I,"This is the second cardio dance DVD I've tried and I definitely prefer it. The dance steps are pretty straightforward - being someone with next to no dance training and opting to skip over the training session, I was able to pick up the moves pretty simply. The program is split into 3 parts (plus warm-up & cool down). Two dances titled the 'rock it' and 'own it' respectively, taught in two separate segments until you're combining about 6 moves per dance routine. This is followed up by a 'toning' segment that focuses more on integrating dance with traditional sculpting moves like squats and lunges.

The main downside to this DVD is twofold. For one, I don't know that it's that solid of a cardio workout - although I know my heart rate was up for the whole thing, it wasn't the level of intensity I'm used to by any means. For another, it's literally just one 45-minute program - and having already done a solid job the first couple of times I used it, there isn't really anywhere to go from here other than mastering it completely.

That being said, this is fun, and the instructor's promise that it'll take the work out of workout is accurate. It's a bit cheesy and you'll probably feel like a moron doing a few of the moves, but get into it and you'll have a good time. Overall I'd say this is a fun cardio program to throw on when you're not up to a hardcore sculpting workout, but still want to get your heart going.",1263600000,44,1428,4.40530303030303
3964319,4,B002PCKX0I,"Although collage rates this DVD beginner/inter level, but I think it's not for absolute beginners. The choreography is not very complicated, but it's quite challenging at first. Overall, it's a fun and high energy dance exercise.",1261267200,16,229,5.388888888888889

3964342,3,B002PCKX0I,This video was okay. It was hard to follow when you don't have a dancing video in you. If you are doing it for fun that it would be a good video for you.,1392854400,,153,3.5294117647058822

3964353,5,B002PCKX0I,The dance steps are pretty easy to pick up as she goes over them in the preview so you can practice a lot before you even start the program. Plus you don't have to do the whole dvd for the workout.  I go as far as I can and then start again the next time and see if I can go further.  She's a good instructor!,1361923200,4,309,3.6666666666666665
3964354,2,B002PCKX0I,I work out everyday but I am also over 60 years old.  This was just too difficult for me. I could not learn the steps no matter how hard I tried. Best leave it to someone that is either younger or has done some other dance videos. I gave it away.,1361232000,,246,3.823529411764706

3964357,2,B002PCKX0I,I felt that it was more like an exercise video than a dance video. I only tried it for about 15 minutes and then got frustrated and shut it off. It wasn't what I was expecting .,1360713600,,177,3.810810810810811

3964359,2,B002PCKX0I,"I've been doing workouts on my Wii Fit and was hoping to try a new exercise routine.  Maybe I'm not coordinated enough for a dancing workout.  Either way, it's hard to follow along since Bethany fails to carefully break down the moves.  Some of the moves were too confusing and ran together with other moves.  I got frustrated and turned it off.  Everyone has their own style and preference... this one just wasn't for me.",1359504000,4,422,4.573333333333333

3964382,4,B002PCKX0I,"I did this for the first time today, and found it really fun.  I broke a decent sweat, and learned some new dance moves.  It's not super cheesy like a lot of the other dance workouts, and the instructor is clear, concise, and enjoyable to follow.  The first time you do this, definitely watch the intro where she breaks down the dance steps.  Some are more challenging than others, but by the end of it, I almost had all the moves right.  I've been doing a lot of Core Fusion dvds (Body Sculpt and Cardio Pure Intensity) and it's nice to mix in this easier, intermediate workout.  I get my heart pumping but don't feel like I'm gonna pass out like I do sometimes with Core Fusion stuff.  Lastly, a dance workout--could it feel any less like a workout?  No way!",1358380800,6,760,4.340425531914893
3964383,4,B002PCKX0I,Very good dance video.  Not just one dance like some videos I have purchased.  Well worth the money.  Good workout.,1357689600,,115,4.65

It works, if your into dancing.
I lost 20 pounds with this dvd. Its a lot of fun also.",1355184000,2,131,3.5517241379310347
3964385,5,B002PCKX0I,This DVD is a must for people of any age that want a fun method of exercising.  The step guide provides simple to follow instructions.

3964386,5,B002PCKX0I,"I've been doing workout DVDs for 15 years, and this one is my favorite so far.  I have a variety of workout DVDs including hula, bellydancing, hip-hop, salsa, Zumba, Abs of Steel, and more, but I really love this one.  It's easy to learn but not too simple, the moves are fun with a good variety, and the instructor is motivational.",1350604800,3,332,4.426229508196721
3964387,5,B002PCKX0I,"This was a nice, intermediate dance aerobic workout. The 3 segments were taught well and all of the choreography flowed together nicely. The tutorial will break down all the moves for you and the workout is very nice! It has 3, 10 min segments that you learn and put all the moves together for each segment, then you move on to the next. It was a great 40 min workout that was not too hard, but just the right amount of fun and cardio. Bethany is a good intructor that is not fake-with a bunch of sexy talk. That always turns me off to dance workouts! She does say ""Party""  and ""own it"" a few times, but other than that she cues well and seems to have a cool personality and put a really fun routine togeher!",1288828800,10,708,4.1678832116788325
3964388,3,B002PCKX0I,"The good:
*The instructor is very likable and not annoying.
*I felt I got a decent workout, more so than some other dance workouts I've done.
*It wasn't too cheesy.
*The first dance was really fun, and the second one was okay.  I caught on the first time through but didn't feel it was too easy.

The bad:
*The toning section!  Simply terrible.  It moved too quickly for me to get much out of it all since I couldn't keep up, and I usually don't have a problem following toning workouts or aerobics.  The moves seemed just randomly thrown together and weren't really a dance...I would have much preferred a third dance!  That is why I got a dance DVD, after all.
*The music was weird, but then again, most exercise DVDs have lousy music.

The ugly:
*The instructor didn't really mention much pertaining to form, and hers could have been better.  I'm relatively new to exercise, and even I know that you should not bend in a plie so low that your knees go out past your toes (as hers do frequently), or that you not should fully extend/lock your elbow when punching out (in the toning section) since it is hard on the joint.  The two background dancers had better form, it seemed.

Bottom line...I probably would not buy this DVD again, but now that I do have it, I will use it but shut it off after the first two dances.",1279411200,10,1320,4.372950819672131
3964389,5,B002PCKX0I,"Finally!  A workout that is even left and right.  My biggest beef with the dance videos is that the instructors think that it can have lopsided moves since it is just a dance.  Well, I use them for a workout and want things to be even.  I usually have to change the moves, but this one was great.  The moves are different and fun and I like this instructor a lot.  No baby talk, no fake toughness- just a pleasant manner and nice voice.  Refreshing!  I didn't use the step guide, can't be bothered with it since I want to workout, and I was fine.  The aerobic part did make me sweat and the sculpting part was surprisingly not boring.  I did have to concentrate on the moves to  keep up, which is good for my brain as well as my body!",1265932800,46,734,4.098591549295775
8376890,5,B002PCKX0I,"This is one of my favorites in the Dance Off The Inches.
Bethany is so good and directed and it seems to really help me.
physically and mentally. She's fun, fairly easy to follow and my
only regret is I cant find more dance DVDs by her.",1519516800,,236,4.042553191489362
8376891,5,B002PCKX0I,"Fantastic video - still using it after several years.  Just enough for older person to get exercise.  If you are a fitness nut, it won't be enough of a workout for you.  The music is not great but that doesn't bother me.",1492128000,,220,4.190476190476191
8376892,3,B002PCKX0I,"I really love to try to dance but I am really bad at it. My hips don't shake, my feet don't do what they are supposed to and my arms are all over the place. This video makes dancing fun as it concentrates on only 10 different dance moves. For me even 10 is a lot but I did catch on and was able to do this video. The instructor here is likable and she makes you want to do this and keep going. I hated the music as I found it to be a bit strange and I consider myself somewhat of a strange soul. They say you can learn the 10 dance moves in 10 minutes. For me I had to re watch that section several times to get it. My first day of this video was strictly learning the moves so I could do the video. I did have fun trying and will do it again.

8376895,2,B002PCKX0I,"My complaint with this is that it is NOT for beginners.  These are fast changing dance moves.

NOT for the beginner.  There are fast and advance dance steps..
If you are a beginner,  If you are OUT of shape . . . ..

Here are 3 other dvds that I recommend instead...
Walk away the pounds, 20 minute Power Mile.  This is excellent for out of shape beginners.  I use it as a warm up to other videos.
Walk on to Weight Loss,  Walking Pilates.  Also excellent.  It is a 3.5 mile / 50 minute work out.  BOTH of these videos provide excellent form and safety tips.

For an ab workout,  Dance off the inches TUMMY TONE PARTY ZONE with Marie Forleo... NOT OTHER Dance off the inches videos.  This instructor repeats the same moves over and over so that you can catch on in one to two attempts at the video.  The warm up is not good in this video,  but with the WALK AWAY the POUNDS video for 15 minutes,  you can get an excellent warm up before moving on to this  39 minute video.",1450828800,,972,4.106951871657754
8376896,5,B002PCKX0I,"3 sessions, each 10 minutes last. Warming up and cool down each 5 minutes. Easy to learn and fun workout. This is what I want.
I continuous using this DVD 2 years, 4-5 times a week. I love it....",1431388800,,195,4.0256410256410255
8376897,5,B002PCKX0I,"I started off Dance Off the Inches with the country line dancing one. I am far from coordinated but I got bored just using the elliptical to work out. I continually fell out of workout routines due to boredom. Like all of these dance videos there's a learning curve to each one but I feel like this particular one is easier to use for the uncoordinated non-dancers like me. The steps are easy but fun, the instructor leads you a bit so you know what the next move is going to be and she breaks down the dances in pieces initially so they are easy to learn and get the hang of. I now alternate between this one and the country line dancing one and since I started doing these dances my confidence has increased exponentially. It was only a matter of a month or so (dancing 3 days a week) before I noticed a difference in how I felt about how I looked. I don't find the instructor annoying at all, in fact I really like her; she's easy to follow and doesn't shake your confidence in yourself like other instructors do.  If you've tried others of this series such as the hip-hop one and felt that you just couldn't keep up, don't give up on the idea of Dance Off the Inches! Definitely give this one a try. It's fun, it works, and it really is for everybody, whether you're coordinated or not!",1429747200,,1290,4.26530612244898
