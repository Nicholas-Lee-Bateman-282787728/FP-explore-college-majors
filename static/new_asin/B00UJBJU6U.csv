7046526,5,B00UJBJU6U,"GREAT STORY AT A TERRIFIC PRICE. EVEN BETTER THAN
 E-BAY",1477267200,,56,4.6
7046527,5,B00UJBJU6U,"As wonderful in every way as I remember the mini-series.  In these perilous and contentious times, this story and the prequel, Winds of War, should be required viewing  --- as well as reading --- for those too young to remember the horrors of World War II and how close we are to repeating some of the same mistakes.  The changes in casting from Winds of War, especially the Natile and Byron characters greatly improved portrayals in a way that reflected characters' new sober maturity in a dangerous world.  Mitchum is at his finest.",1476835200,,534,4.709677419354839
7046528,5,B00UJBJU6U,The complete set is TERRIFIC!  I was surprised at how graphic the scenes were pictured.  It brought home to me the horrors of the war far more than newsreels have.  I would recommend it!,1476144000,2,186,4.411764705882353

8707065,1,B00UJBJU6U,"In the fine print I  discovered that this set will not play on American dvd, plus it appears to be in German. I have returned  the dvds.",1485302400,,136,4.0
8707066,5,B00UJBJU6U,"I watched War and Remembrance when It first appeared on TV over 30 years ago. I bought the set for my son-in law and grandson who had no concept of what WW II was actually like. Neither can believe the cruelty men are capable of. Unfortunately I have seen it in person on many occasions and in many countries. I rate War and Remembrance along with Schindler's List as movies which should be shown in every high school, so that our past wars are never forgotten. If you fail to learn from history, you will repeat it.",1484870400,,516,4.329896907216495
