6033485,4,B00FW6B4EI,"This is a reflection on the meaning of life, and on what can be known by the human intellect. Even as the retired professor writes his book discrediting all religions and myths as ""illusion"", he himself begins to witness events cannot be explained by science or logic. He refuse to believe in ghosts, but what are those visions that appear out of nowhere? In the end he will find the answer in a unexpected way... but perhaps that's the only way for many of us to finally find answers to what cannot be answered by our mind.",1432944000,3,524,4.412371134020619

He has no heirs and takes a immediate liking to this destitute wanderer. Turns out she is paranormal, and things start to get strange in their presence. It is basically a love story minus the sex.

6033489,5,B00FW6B4EI,"What a fantastic movie this was! I enjoyed every minutes. This was love story with spiritual fathom. I studied paranormal, parapsychology, afterlife, reincarnation and others. To the non-believer, this movie  was non-sense, I think. But after studying so many books on this field, I think this movie was well constructed and very interesting. Lonely widower found happiness in taking care of free-spirited young woman, who was true psychic. She feels spirits and has power of premonition. There was some interesting scene of table tipping or levitating and visionary appearance. This French movie is truly great in every which way. Young woman and old man were both played well without any sexuality. I will give 10 score to this beautiful movie. I could feel old man's happiness in spirit without any greed. He is beautiful and she understood his beauty. What a wonderful but sad love story this was!",1432598400,14,901,5.087837837837838

But it was the cover that caught my attention. What can I say. However the interaction between the characters was what kept me watching. It was interesting how their circumstance and attitudes changed and how it all transpired.

Then there's the white sheeted ""ghost"" attack causing the lead male to black out, followed by poltergeists trashing the place.  Even forewarned of what happens after she seduces someone, Michel becomes seduced by Dora and arranges to transfer his entire Estate to her ""when he dies"".

6033550,5,B00FW6B4EI,"This film is a true heartbeat, a masterful new experience that only french director can make.
Yes it is not an erotic film.
Don't be fooled by the cover of the dvd.
It is even rated 15 in UK.
Meaning? It has some nudity but no one, I mean no one will be crazy about watching those shots with thinking something that has to do with sexuality at all. Those were true work of art something that is as if you are looking at the photos or pictures from the wall in the exhibition room or public places for viewers.

The story is very hard to explain.
It has something to do with supernatural phenomenon. So is it a horror film? Hell no.
Is it an erotic film? I already said no.
What is it then?

It's about this woman about 27 who was beaten by this guy and ends up with staying in this old guy who lives alone who is a great figure ex-math professor who's wife passed away a long time ago.
He forgot that he is alone but after her appearance he begins to feel that he was alone.
After a few days since she was recovered, she tells him that she will leave.
She doesn't wanted to be a burden to him.
But then, some things, strange things begin to happen in this house.
Wierd sound come out from nowhere. Things wer crashing down from the top. No one touches them.
Even the old man sees strange things as well.
Is this house haunted?

Then again this woman comes back to the house sayig she was kicked out from her friend's.
This time the old man grabbed her not to leave.
It was not love but something else.
Maybe lonliness maybe sympahty for her. Something that has nothing to do with sex. Even his friend is mocking him that are you interested in her since he is living alone for so long.
He slowly educates her. She is kind of promiscuouse and even brings boys at home to have sex.
The old man sees them having sex and doesn't complain at all.
He says it's your own will and as long as you are staying with me it' fine whatever you do.
Then he sees things again. The woman with long long black dress, the twom women inclued that girl naked posing on the beautiful cloth like a billion dollar photo like angels, Brief encounter of terrifying ghost passing by.
She tells him about her parents death and since then what happened in her life, I think those images are happening because of her. She brought them in this house.
He even saw images of his dead wife. He begain to think that maybe this girl is a figure of his dead wife's resurrection.
Then she tells things that only her wife knew.
He suddenly writes a will that all the things will be left to her.
She refuses at once. She truely didn't wanted them. She was a good girls after all.
Then one day he was stabbed by this guy and passed by in front of this girl.

Being left in this house she sees the dead man going to heaven.
She is now educated, bacame a totally different figure.
The man becomes one of the small but unforgettably beautiful stars in the sky shinning so bright.
He doesn't care anyone will look at that particular star or not. It will just shine 24 hours a day.

This is a beautiful little movie. It's not even stereo but the Mahler's symphony no 5 was playing the whole time that makes this movie more classy.

This is a must see movie who likes movies like <DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE> or <VALERIE AND HER WEEK OF WONDER> or any other movies made by TERRENCE MELLICK.
It's a great great work of art.",1465776000,,3372,4.204018547140649

6033666,4,B00FW6B4EI,"My high school French seems to be gone, but I enjoyed the subtitles (which were excellent) and the acting and setting and the storyline. It's a quirky ghost film, but I quite enjoyed watching it. There was no creepy music that always seems so pervasive in American films, which I appreciated because that meant that the acting and storyline had to carry the film and it certainly did. Costumes were the special effects for the ghosts and spirits, rather than computer-generated magic. There were several tricks of the eye which were quite clever. I rather liked the less-scary aspect of this movie, which let me really get into the characters and their wants, needs and secrets. I hardly ever watch foreign films, but I think I have been missing a lot by not treating myself to work of this caliber. The ending (no spoilers here) was very heartfelt and even though I sort of knew it was coming, I cried because it was so well done. There was one scene where a former student greets the hero on the street and really, that scene should have been on the cutting room floor because it did not advance the plot, however, it was a short scene. Otherwise, very wonderful movie. I wish it was dubbed in English, but I guess I better pick up my French again so I can watch more foreign films.",1434585600,,1284,4.515021459227468

6033680,4,B00FW6B4EI,"I don't typically review movies because how many people really need to see my opinion of Star Wars?

But, this being a less mainstream movie with fewer reviews, I thought my review could do some good.

I gave this movie 4 stars, but really feel like it's more like 3.5 stars.  More good than bad, but with enough loose ends by the end that it left me a bit unsatsified.  Maybe the loose ends were intentional leaving them as mysteries for the viewer, but either way I felt the same.

Let me first talk about the cover art.  I think potential viewers should know this is not a movie about sex with hot nude scenes.  The cover was taken from a scene which probably last 10 - 15 seconds in the movie, but otherwise has no real bearing in the movie.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the scene was out there specifically so that the movie could have the provocative cover art to get attention.  In short, don't watch this movie for the skin or you will be disappointed.

What I liked in this movie is I thought it was a very sweet, melancholy movie about an old, lonely man finding some (non-sexual) companionship in his waning days with an unusual, but caring young woman.  The movie tries to make a stab at some basic philosophical items such as what is real? What is illusion/delusion?  Does it really matter so long as we choose to believe it?  I thought it was sometimes well done and sometimes heavy handed exposition, but to each his own on that.

Mostly what I liked is I did think the pace of the movie, character development, and the two lost souls sort of finding each other (but not entirely) for companionship in their difficult lives against a Parisian backdrop was interesting to watch.

The paranormal side of the movie is where I'm most mixed.  I'm not really into paranormal, but I thought it had a very interesting build up with virtually no pay off.  I liked the way Nora took the paranormal events almost casually...as if she was used to it and it was just one more thing that goes on in the world.  I liked the build up wondering what these evil spirits were doing there.  What did they want?  What were they going to do?  What would happen?  Unfortunately, by the end, I'm still not sure I know.  They seemed mostly it be there so a talky movie had something to break up the talk a bit.  I mean, the author could have meant something more by them and I just missed it somehow. It certainly felt like it during the build up.  But, sitting here I couldn't tell you what it was.

So, my bottom line is I thought it was a good movie that could have been great with some polish.  I get both the 1 star and the 5 star reviews, though.  In an age where many movies appear to be slight variations of the same script at least this one tried to be different with some success.",1434153600,38,2788,4.309615384615385

Some have described this as a love story laced with the supernatural.  But, it really boils down to the last weeks of life for an old man grasping for a soulmate ... people who can interrelate at an intellectual and spiritual level.

They are brought together as the protagonist, a lonely elderly man, chases away a villainous man brutally attacking a young woman.  The woman presents under suspicious circumstances, like reading the man's address card whilst in a panicked escape from an attacker .. or so we're led to believe.  The young woman admits that her relationships end badly.  Yet, he lowers his defenses and develops a relationship, but it seems a a subtle yet elaborate deception, fulfilling the delusion of the gentleman.  He eventually bequeaths his property to the girl; a gesture of his affectation.  Yet in the end, the villain who brought the two together would separate them, leaving the girl.",1433721600,3,1089,4.93956043956044

8618827,4,B00FW6B4EI,"Because it leaves so many gaps to fill in, this film is not for everyone.  It is full of arresting images, unexplained occurrences that can be extremely bizarre, and a strange relationship.

An old man saves a troubled girl from a violent encounter, taking her in and almost adopting her.  She is standoffish, puncturing his intellectual pride with a flick of her wrist, yet somehow drawn to this lonely man.  All the while, malevolent things happen with increasing frequency, from sounds in the night to appearances of spectres.  None of it makes much sense, yet it fits with the book that the man is attempting to write.  The young lady seems to bring this out and serves as a muse and critic, but she doesn't know what is happening either.  He hires her to help with the book, the great task of his life, or so it seems.  The man speculates about what it all means and makes some big decisions, disturbing the state of stasis that he has comfortably inhabited since his wife's death a decade earlier.

The ending is a surprise, I do not want to play the spoiler, but it somehow fit.  I enjoyed the film because of its persistent mood, a mystery bound to the girl.  I recommend it for those who are willing to fill the gaps with their own imagination.",1473897600,,1253,4.5

I having lived in Italy, very close to France, I can tell you that as an American what may seem a slow pace is in reality the speed at which the French and Italians live. It took me several years to adjust to it and this genera of film makes me  melancholy to return.

As to the cover I will admit I was bored and drawn to the cover as I have seen French XS's flicks and was pleasantly surprised to have found a gem of a movie. In my defense Dora's first critic of his book was that it wasn't it wasn't an attention grabber so ma be she did publish.....

I think that this would be perfect material for Broadway as the scenery is simple, and it has both faces of a great play.",1471132800,,729,4.083916083916084
