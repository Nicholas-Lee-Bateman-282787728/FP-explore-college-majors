2191391,5,B0006Q940K,"Our Daughter will be 2 this year (2013) and she just loves this movie. She has learned so much from it. She interacts with it a lot which I love because the DVD is 50 minutes long but she is on the move when she is watching it. She has learned to help clean up her mess, as well as learn what a mess is. Now that any time something is dirty or on the floor that shouldn't be its a mess. Learned circles, left, right, jump like a frog, a frog says ribbit ribbit & more. She loves Jojo!! We would buy this DVD again. It was in perfect condition and came in a few days after ordering it. We didn't wait that long for it at all.",1372464000,,624,3.8449612403100777

2191404,5,B0006Q940K,"Growing up my girls have really enjoyed this series, which resembles claymation but in a slick, computer created form. This dvd contains four of the show episodes: 1. Easy As Pie 2. Take A Bow 3. JoJo On The Tightrope 4. Happy Hoppy Day! and includes one episode of the show Higglytown Heroes.

Despite being a great series I have a MAJOR COMPLAINT with Disney, who owns this property. WHERE ARE THE SEASON DVD SETS?? By the time they come out my girls will be in high school! Right now there is only this dvd and Animal A Go Go. (A total of 8 episodes.) That's weak. I believe there are currently 3 seasons (64 episodes) that have been aired from 2005-07. Disney has to be losing out on big $ by not offering more episodes.",1224806400,13,724,4.323529411764706
2191405,5,B0006Q940K,"My 2 year old daughter Emerson absolutely loves JoJo.  It started when she saw JoJo on Playhouse Disney's ""Feeling Good with JoJo"" 5 minute short series. So, my husband and I decided to purchase her a few DVD's we could keep on hand at home.  We are glad we did!  She loves this DVD as well as ""Animal A Go-Go"".  I find her imitating the various animal movements and dancing to and singing along with all of the songs.  She even does this after the DVD has ended.  It is the cutest thing!  If you are looking for a DVD that keeps your child ""active"" throughout and not just staring into space, then I highly recommend this.",1220745600,,623,4.273504273504273
2191406,5,B0006Q940K,"I love JoJo! It's cute, hip and fun. My daughter has been grinning at her from day one. If you are looking for clean, wholesome and easy to watch stuff that talks about manners, self-esteem, health and exercise without feeling like you're watching more of what you've seen everywhere else, this is it!",1202515200,,301,4.69811320754717
