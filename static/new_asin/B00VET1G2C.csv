7087846,2,B00VET1G2C,"When I first found out about this movie in April, I was excited to see it! I was looking forward to an H.P. Lovecraft movie that would show a lot of the creatures of the Mythos, it would be dark, very scary, and exciting. This simply WAS NOT THAT MOVIE!! The movie was too low budget (when there are no subtitles on a DVD, that's not a good sign."" The movie was too comical. It was mostly about  a reporter doing stupid interviews, and the movie barely even mentions H. P. Lovecraft, and almost all of the stories of the movie don't tie in to his stories in any way. I was hoping for a movie that was very scary, creepy and would tie in to the Lovecraftian stories. I though 'The Last Lovecraft"" movie was way better than this one. At least in that movie, they made many references to the stories, you got to see Deep Ones, and even a cartoon version of Cthulhu. It too was comical, but it worked better than in this one....See it if you wish...... But Lovecraft fans will be let down.",1441411200,,985,4.211640211640212
7087847,1,B00VET1G2C,"If I could give this negative stars I would. The fact I have to give it one bothers me. I would rather stick bamboo shoots under my fingernails than watch this utter garbage ever again. I regret wasting one penny on this. Chaotic, no story, horrible acting, besides saying H.P. Lovecraft over and over again this film has nothing to with Lovecraft or his stories. I could have made a better film. I can not warn you away from this trash enough. Complete garbage and a waste of money. Don't get suckered in like I did. This is Lovecracked re-packaged.",1441238400,2,550,4.51

8709877,2,B00VET1G2C,Wow I may be one of the most generous raters of movies that takes the time to review them!!!  I rarely give even a B-rate movie less than 5 stars if it achieves in simply entertaining me on its given budget !  So why so hard on this movie????  Because it failed to entertain me on any level!!!  I almost feel it was designed to be a insult to H.P. Lovecraft fans!!!  The effort to make me laugh totally failed & the brief adaptations of Lovecraft's short story's failed to entertain me!!!  The best & only saving grace to this bomb is the cover art for the D.V.D. !!!  I am glad I didn't pay a lot for this huge disappointment!!!,1449619200,,629,4.148760330578512

8709879,4,B00VET1G2C,"Greetings;

As I am  sure you have read by now, this is in many way the other movie- Lovecracked. Nothing about it is groundbreaking, it isn't all that special. For the longest time I thought that it was something along the lines of a Troma movie, if you are familiar with the company, it certainly has that feel about it. There was also that short section with Llyod Kaufman at the Troma headquarters, but apparently that had to do with them having asked permission to have some Troma related material in one scene and being told that Lloyd would do an interview if they wanted him to. Going into this though, I read the reviews and still bought it. I own lovecracked. I watched the features and found the little hidden videos here and there. Actually, there may have only been one. Either way. I got it, looked over the cover art, recognized some of the film stills on the back cover art. Knowing that it was by the director Elias and knowing what I knew from watching some of the bonus features from Lovecracked, I just sort of figured that this was an additional installment. It was originally a kind of poor mans' Lovecraft film festival set. People were one way or another contacted or informed of what was being put together, Videos long and short were submitted and some of them made the cut, other's didn't, but they were all supposed to be Lovecraft themed one way or another. The masturbating ghost film as a special feature on Lovecracked for example was, I believe, a late entry that they still felt warranted mention even if the film was already put together.

This...This sort of fell into what I was expecting. Yes, it had a lot of the original in it and they certainly cut some of the other out. The Joanna Angel's repenetrator movie wasn't included this time for example, but to be sure, there were probably just as many new films included as old ones, so that was, a little bit of a saving grace. That all said, I would have been much happier having seen it as a separate sequel instead of...Whatever exactly you would call this.

For those of you who really hate the Elias as the reporter bits, bare in mind that is just the wrap around arc for the film, you are watching it for the short stories. You start off watching this or the other version and immediately turn it off because of that, you are selling yourself short. The shorts are generally cheaply done but then these were fan done to whatever extent and not necessarily done with much experience or a budget so, ask yourself if you think you could have done better. Then tape it, post it on YouTube and maybe submit a link in the comments below and let other be the judge. Who knows, maybe you will make it onto a future dvd installment of the H.P. Lovecraft film festival series. Or a future re-release of lovecracked or whatever you would call this particular listing.

After looking around a bit, nearest I can tell, Lovecracked was actually more or less a smaller, more limited release which included some material that Elias had shot himself to make up for some shorts that one of the other directors had done-but at the time of compiling the set, might have pulled out but didn't. The interview I watched didn't specify what or where, but that whatever-all would be included in the edition that would be done through a more major distributor, which I am guessing this listing is. So, cool, I guess. Still would have been happier with a sequel. But cool.

Anyways, hope you all find this a bit helpful, maybe turn some heads back this way around. My final thoughts on this film is this-I am glad I bought it, I didn't pay that much for it anyways, right around $6 at the time and I think you can get it for right around $4 or $5 now? Whatever guys. I was actually going to dig my old copy of Lovecracked out and watch it here sooner or later anyways. Still might for a better idea of what-all had been cut from it in this copy.

Thanks...",1443657600,,3923,4.447844228094576
8709880,3,B00VET1G2C,"The opening moments will of this anthology will let you know right away if you're going to love or hate it. When I saw the very first shot of the film with its plastic bat flapping around and obvious mist from a smoke machine I groaned and thought I was in for a disaster. Then the camera pulls out so that you see the crew members manning the smoke machine and the holding the rod the bat's attached to and I laughed out loud. This is a film aware of it's low budget aesthetic and isn't afraid to poke a little fun at it. As with any anthology the stories vary in quality but the majority range from ok to really entertaining. If you're a Lovecraft fan you'll be recognize most of the stories, Herbert West, Re-animator and The Statement of Randolph Carter are just some the adaptations included. Over all, a fun low budget anthology that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself or its subject matter.",1441670400,2,897,4.345238095238095
8709881,3,B00VET1G2C,"Horror anthologies are a dime a dozen these days and pretty hit or miss as a result. This one is pretty uneven and definitely on the stranger and weirder end of the spectrum and what I liked a lot were the stabs at humor that ran throughout the movie in the form of a wraparound story. Another nice plus, the shorts/segments never feel like they run too long. Kinda like a Lovecraft-themed film fest on DVD with a goofy Monty Python style wraparound. If you liked Trick 'r Treat, VHS or the ""ABCs of Death"", then you'll probably enjoy this pretty different take on the horror anthology sub-genre as well.",1441497600,,604,4.5
8709882,4,B00VET1G2C,"I'm not sure what's more entertaining, all these angry 1-star reviews or the movie itself, which was pretty fun actually and not a half-bad way to burn 90 min. Admittedly I'm not an avid reader of Lovecraft, but as a movie buff who loves horror and comedy, especially when they're combined (the case here) I enjoyed this for what it was: gory, creepy, silly. I suggest you give it a whirl and consider adding drinks and a couple friends into the mix to up the ante - I did!",1441497600,,473,4.325842696629214
