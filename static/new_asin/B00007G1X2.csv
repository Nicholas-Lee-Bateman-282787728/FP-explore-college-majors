1808478,3,B00007G1X2,"When CBS has the First incarnation of Stacy Keach as Mike Hammer, it was harder and gritter like the books. Then Keach got busted for drugs in England and they canceled Hammer.

I do not remember who revised Hammer. This time saddling with an assistant (played by Robert Conrad's son Shane) and a younger, perkier Velma (played  by Shannon Whirry). Thes new adventures of Hammer seek weaker and died a quick death as a series in a season of 26 episodes

All twenty six episodes are here in this box set. One can only wish the first incarnation will be available soon--then you can see the real Mike Hammer as it was in the shows Hayday and glory

1808479,4,B00007G1X2,"This series is bawdy in a tongue and cheek way and totally not PC, I think that is what makes watching it so much fun.  Mike Hammer is an old school private eye living in the digital era, but at least he can still solve crimes and catch the ""bad guys"". It is campy and full of puns, if you enjoy blood and elaborate chase scenes this is not for you.  But if you just want to have a chuckle and don't take things you see on television shows that seriously this could be a choice for you. Never saw the original however.",1126483200,11,518,4.019417475728155
1808480,5,B00007G1X2,"Despite the info above, this item is not close-captioned!  So if that kind of thing is important to you, bear this in mind.  As for the show itself, I find any Mike Hammer vehicle with Stacy Keach in the role worthwhile.  True, the 80's version of the show had a better budget and (usually) bigger name guest stars.  (When is that show coming out on DVD, by the way?)

But Keach is as good as ever as an older,wiser Hammer trying to deal with modern-day appliances such as cellphones, computers, etc., while still remaining the gumshoe we know and love. As soon as I hear that saxophone and Keach's voiceover, I'm hooked.  You will be too.  Highly recommended.",1123977600,41,660,4.5423728813559325
1808481,3,B00007G1X2,"Apparently this DVD is the same as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer: Song Bird (1984).  This is one of the later episodes (minus Pat Chambers and plus Nick.)  I prefer the earlier episodes, but they seem to be as yet unavailable on DVD.",1109721600,11,233,4.523809523809524
1808482,4,B00007G1X2,"I've been a fan of Spillane's creations since discovering the novel One Lonely Night at the age of 10.  Heck, the Hardy boy's never spanked a woman with a belt, just for being a communist!  Anyhow, it's about time one of the Hammer television shows starring Stacey Keach made it to DVD.  Nobody does Mike Hammer better, PERIOD.  He shines in the role once again in Song Bird.  His love for the character is obvious and a joy to watch.
  Jazz, mafia, some tough-fast talking, and slick running narrative make this one a must for the Hammer fans.  Shannon Whirry plays the role of Velda.  If you happen to look away from the screen during a scene with heavy dialog, you may hear a voice that's so familiar it nags at your memory.  Well, to save ya some mental calisthenics, the other main character (the trumpet player) is none other than Jack Sheldon.  If you're not familiar with the name, you might remember the voice from Schoolhouse Rock's ""I'm Just a Bill,"" or ""Conjunction Junction,"" et al.
  There are only 2 things that prevent me from giving this DVD 5 stars.  First off, no special features.  Second, Frank Stallone delivers a completely cardboard performance (thankfully it's brief.)  All in all, it's brilliant, cheesy, and fantastic all the way through.  I hope to see more of this super-cool TV series (and the 2 previous runs) released on DVD soon.",1055376000,13,1362,4.65546218487395
1808483,3,B00007G1X2,"A decent story in the world of Mike Hammer with Stacy Keach again playing the famous private eye.  I always enjoyed Keach as Hammer, he seemed to fill the part from the classic pulp novels well, and this is no exception.  We see Mike Hammer in a frenzied race to save a jazz singer from the police and the mafia both, dodgingthe district attorney and hit man alike.  Not a fantastic plot, but fun none the less.",1051142400,6,411,4.311688311688312
1808484,3,B00007G1X2,"I've always had a weak spot for Stacy Keach's Mike Hammer.
The 1980's program was cheesy and silly, but its star could claim to be the last pure descendant of the old school, all-American, hard-boiled private eye.  And the plots of episodes of 'Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer' were much like those once found in the pulpy pages of magazines with titles like 'Dime Detective', 'Thrilling Detective', and 'Black Mask'.
Back in 1997 there was an aborted attempt to re-start the 1980's 'Mike Hammer' television series.  The new show was called 'Mike Hammer: Private Eye' and brought back Stacy Keach in the lead role.  It was syndicated and, seeing as how the plots were weak and local showtimes were inevitably scheduled well past midnight, lasted only 26 programs before it was shut down.  'Song Bird' takes a two part story from this series and tries, not very hard, to dress it up like a movie.
The weaknesses of 'Song Bird' are the weaknesses of 'Mike Hammer: Private Eye'-- the plot is standard, the action brief and unspectacular, and the budget clearly low even by the standards of syndication.  But it does have Stacy Keach heading a cast of solid actors obviously having a damn good time in archetypical roles that seem tailored to fit.  Keach has an almost uncanny ability to utter any line with a degree of sincerity that sells it, and does a remarkable job playing Hammer as a graying, unrepentant tough-guy from another era.
So if you're looking for a solid detective story, you're likely to be disappointed.  But if you're looking for a solid detective, here he is.",1045180800,14,1575,4.789667896678967

1808506,5,B00007G1X2,"I noticed there were several people who thought that the original series that aired in the mid 80's was better, but I beg to differ. Maybe it is because I am older now and found the older series fun, but a little cheeses as was so much of TV  in the 80's.  The later series from 1997 and 1998 does have an older Hammer, a wiser Hammer and still attracts the ladies, but the humor seems better and the writing is some of the best I've seen on TV.  Too bad they can't find writers like that today, or would be willing to pay good writers. Velda is smarter this time around too. She is a beautiful smart blonde and played well by Shannon Whirry.  Shane Conrad plays a great young side kick to Hammer, which was missing in the 80's.  We have the great friend and chief of police played by Peter Jason and the nasty and unlikable district attorney played well by Kent Williams. You love to hate him. And there is a newcomer and fun character, Maya, played by Malgosia Tomassi, who rents an office for her yoga classes in the same building as Hammer's PI office. She always needs Hammer's help for one thing or another. The characters are all well developed and by the time you are finished with the 26 episodes you wish there were 26 more to go.",1266624000,3,1240,4.259574468085106
1808507,5,B00007G1X2,"Do you like detective movies where the character is like the real thing? Well Mike Hammer is as close to a real detective as you can get.
Songbird was originally released in 1998 as part of the Mike Hammer television series, and was actually a two part tv program. It was released as a full length movie in 2003.
The dvd contains cast filmographies (just those of Shane Conrad, Stacy Keach, and Shannon Whirry), is presented in full screen format, has a trailer gallery, interactive menus, and scene selection. And while the movie was originally on tv, there is semi nudity and mild amount of strong language.
The story is about a female jazz singer known as Lila B, who becomes the prime suspect in a series of murders when some of her fellow band members and her mob boss boyfriend all end up dead, and its up to Mike Hammer to find her and keep her safe. But it won't be easy, Not only are the police after her, but so is the mob, and they send their top hitmen out to try and find her.
While the movie is a drama, also look for some perfectly timed comedy, edge-of-your-seat action, and thrills, oh and of course some very very good Jazz. Jack Shelton plays the ever-in-debt trumpet player Des Long, while Moria Walley plays Lila B. and of course there is the ever popular Skip gleason played expertly by Peter Jason, and of course Maya Ricci portrayed by Malgosia Tomassi.
All of the cast are perfectly castfor the movie including the paranoid/money hungry/ pawn shop owner played flawlessly by Nynno Ahli. The pawn shop scene is one of the funniest scenes in the movie especially when Mike asks him ""Do you take credit cards"" and his reply is ""WHY, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?"".
Songbird is one of my top favorite movies of all time, seen it over and over again, and if you like a good story without scenes switching every 2.5 seconds (which by the way is how most tv shows and most movies are filmed today and I believe are NOT good for your eyesight), you're sure to love Songbird.",1257724800,,1982,4.447802197802198

Naked City, Mannix, etc. I had never watched the show when it was on network television. This boxed set is great.  Enjoyable to watch, comical spots but with well written plots. A great deal at this price.",1221264000,,308,4.6
1808510,1,B00007G1X2,"As the critic's review on the Amazon page for this sorry follow-on says ""Not to be confused with the 80's TV series....""  Not to worry - it would be impossible to confuse this with the 80's Mike Hammer TV series.

This 90's remake features sorry scenes, poor acting, and rail-thin story lines.  Keach, still dynamic and all-Mike, is beginning to show his age in this series and simply can't save it on his own (though I doubt the 80's series-version Keach could save this doggy).

Let me say here and now: no matter how big a fan of Mike Hammer you are, skip this remake.  The best I can say for it is, if you're a big enough fan of Hammer you may survive watching the remake.  But you won't be satisfied.

I'm not sure why Keach returned to this role when the remake was so poorly conceived.  Sort of like another private eye favorite of mine, Robert Urich, reprising the Spenser role in those 90's shell-of-the-original TV movies of the great 80's series ""Spenser: For Hire"".  Both Keach and Urich were still great (even having each lost a step and gained a few pounds) and neither deserved the pathetic rehashes they unfortunately left us to suffer through.

But both scenarios beg the same question: why release on DVD these shadow-of-the-series remakes instead of the originals?  Where are the DVD sets for the 80's ""Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer"" & ""Spenser: For Hire""?  Why not lead with strength instead of putting out dreck that may scare off new Hammer and Spenser fans who now only know these after-market rehashes?

Maybe there's a method to the madness of marketing this way.  But when the madness ends, I hope these two great original series will be available on DVD.  In the meantime, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",1216080000,3,1738,4.615635179153094
1808521,3,B00007G1X2,"This collection is not from the series in the 1980s, but rather originates from a short-lived syndicated run in 1997. Stacy Keach made the character then, and his strong portrayal still comes though. Unfortunately, it looks like scripting, direction, and producing fall short. Gone are the location shots of New York City, Mike gets a sidekick, and -- worst of all -- Mike gets beaten up several times!! And he doesn't give it back! Whether this was done to reflect Mike's aging or whatever, this is not quite the Mike Hammer many of us die-hard fans have come to know and respect. Still worth buying, but I recommend on sale.",1206576000,5,626,4.7

But here's the thing I MOST wanted to tell you about. You can buy this exact set, first-quality product, brand new, in a sealed boxed set, for 10 DOLLARS at DOLLAR GENERAL stores. They just put them out on the shelf this week and they have plenty of copies but I wouldn't wait too long!

There is more violence as well as sexual aspects that make it more unappealing to me. Stacy Keach does a good job, but the plots are predictable and the narration by Keach

is so complicated that it is hard to keep up with. Again I have enjoyed it, but it is not nearly as good as the Mike Hammer series in the 1980's.

I love CSI, and I've got perfect vision, but even I would have a hard time spotting the micro sized evidence CSI agents see  with their naked eyes from across a room. Come on guys, I know it's just a show, but you've got to be a little realistic, yet that's just what they do. They walk into a crime scene and see a single hair all the way across the room in the carpet. I mean come on!!! Now back to Mike Hammer, He wins most of his fights, and loses a few (even some of the best fighters in the world have lost a few). He collects baseball cards, eats pizza hot or cold, and loves a good looking lady. He figures out his cases by deduction, logic, and luck, and he's often behind on the rent. The series has well timed action, but not overly done like many shows today, and it's not nearly as gory(CSI has gone too far even though it is a favorite program). There's drama, horror, comedy, and of course Spice. And no other actor has ever portrayed the part better than STACY KEACH (bring back the series America!!!)

However, this box is strongly recommended to people liking the ideas of M.Spilane and also Stacy Keach. The gimmicks complete the 26 films in a perfect way and the interview answers  lot of questions, Hammer fans may have  (who is the lady, he sees in every episode etc).
