My favorite scene is whem King wakes up in (HA) the king's bed, puzzled and bewildered.  The chemistry betweem him and o p Hegge is fantastic.... superb!!  Wish King had made more movies.  His sense of timing holds you tight like a spell!!!!!!!!",1369612800,2,358,4.619047619047619

It has not been restored, because the cost to get out of what they called ""Royal Records"", a place to put all kinds of important works, and some not so important persons, including Percy Faith. Dennis King died in 1971. He must have arranged for his estate to tell the truth about his history. Yes he had done this movie, that no longer existed, stripped by Percy faith, and I have one of the discs where he puts his name and that of Columbia, who could restore it at will if they so chose. They choose not. Why? Dennis King, a great Shakepearean actor, could not sing. He took lessons, but he is truly awful in this picture.

In the recording Mr. King's estate made public Domain, I will be showing on YouTube under Valerie B Kaiser, in the next few months. Mr King admited that he only sang the Vagabond King in Chicago. BUT John Charles Thomas is KNOWN to have sung the love song from this opera on Broadway, Called Nocturne. He then made a full electric recording, needing to use a different style, and was Friml's favorite singer. The first Broadway production for Mr. King, who should have stuck to drama, was the Three Musketeers, and provides a very apt description of his interaction with Flo Ziegfeld. Unfortunately he was upstaged by the then Psudonymed man, Joseph Macaulay, (NOT THE ONE NAMED ON IMDB). Though this man was under a pseudonym he sang Ma Belle nightly and stopped the show. This was famed throughout the first half of the century. The colonge Aramis was named after his character. It was thought he would fully return to the stage, and the song would be attributed to him, etc, etc. He was the first to be tested against Jenette McDonald, (in a foolish movie) with said movie actor Joseph Macaulay, I believe to confuse the two, actually I know so. His person was not used but his vocals dubbed. Sound technology for films was much superior than the early RCA approach.

I object to the fact that this movie has denied being restored for political reasons that are anchient. Though Mr. King's vocal performance is poor, his acting is quite good. They knew he could not sing and renders only a few pieces.

The only reason to have this movie removed from history is that it would cast extreme doubt on his execution of Show Boat, and that his vocals have never once been recorded for any production of show Boat, EVER. Why? He never sang it. The NY times ASCAP expert reported that the entire score was recorded, and though he was very prejudiced in his own way, it means that the score existed in the early electric period. I found it, and will share it with all!",1364083200,2,2618,4.484276729559748
8482946,4,B005Q457KI,This is a very old movie.  The sound track was very good but the picture quality rather less so.  It is still very good to have this early example from the career  of the lovely Jeanette MacDonald and compare her singing then with that in later roles.,1361232000,3,251,4.297872340425532
