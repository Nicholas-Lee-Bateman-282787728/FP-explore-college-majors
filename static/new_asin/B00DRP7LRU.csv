5851352,5,B00DRP7LRU,"I'm not really into Disney, but had previously heard of and been intrigued by Celebration, FL; Perhaps because of the way it is a microcosm of the larger story of modern suburban development in the United States.

This documentary provides a great subtle commentary on both the psychological & physical ramifications of that development (ie: corporate ownership of downtown property leads to businesses which cater to outsiders - the town lacks a gas station or grocery) through the stories of the residents Celebration. These will be tales familiar to a subdivision resident anywhere in the modern US, with Disney and Lexin Capital as stand-ins for the usually faceless corporate entities which control the idyllic suburban life of the rest of us.

Not longer than it needs to be, holds your attention the whole way through, with nice cinematography and good footage. My expectations were surpassed & I would recommend this to others who are just documentary fans & not necessarily Disney fans.",1397952000,4,995,5.135802469135802
5851353,5,B00DRP7LRU,"I heard about this Documentary from the Director when he was a guest on the WDW Fanboys Podcast.  I am a big fan of Disney and didn't know a lot about the town of celebration other than about it's general existence.  This documentary was a great introduction into how the town got created, things that have changed and how things are there not.  It was packed full of great interviews with citizens and former citizens which gave an insider feeling and stories to what the town is like.  I wish we could have seen a little bit more of the town itself, but I enjoyed this film for what it was.",1394928000,,592,4.306306306306307
5851354,3,B00DRP7LRU,"I think the murder, sex tag line is trying a little too hard.  I know other commenters thought it was disparaging to the town of Celebration.  I didn't find it to be that way at all.  It still made me want to find out more about the town and made me think it would be a good place to live.  It just pointed out that the town is not completely in a bubble because it's not immune to some of the things that happen in regular towns all over the USA.  There was a murder, a suicide, affairs, drugs etc,, but on a smaller scale and most people said they loved living there and wouldn't leave.  Even one of the teens said he wouldn't come back UNLESS he had kids, because it's the perfect place to raise kids.  The angsty teens and young twenty somethings were the ones that wanted to leave, but I think that's typical of most kids in the town they grew up in.  So I guess the maker of this documentary did show that there is a mystique about Celebration but it is much like other towns many ways.  The Bubble may only be an illusion.  But it is also safer, cleaner and prettier than most which is what gives you the Bubble feeling.",1394323200,3,1127,4.128440366972477
5851355,1,B00DRP7LRU,"I was one of the first to live in Celebration when it was built. This so-called documentary is an embarrassment to us. First off,--try getting LOCALS that are nawt frahm Minnesota-and actually ARE EDUCATED ON CENTRAL FLORIDA. No wonder Sundance rejected this--now why don't you do the same Amazon. I will never get my 15min of wasted life back. Yes-15min--cause we kept fast-forwarding. Or at least offer it for free. And change the description...we didn't see where SEX had as anything to do with this zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz story. #WALTDISNEYISROLLINGINHISGRAVE",1391904000,4,578,5.579545454545454
5851356,1,B00DRP7LRU,"It felt like I was watching someone's High School video project and the few facts I learned about Celebration covered all of about 5 minutes of this film and were just repeated over and over by different people.  I am certain they added the ""Murder and Sex"" part after they viewed the finished product and realized no or would watch this junk without something to draw them in.  I want this hour of my life back!",1388707200,7,412,4.407894736842105
5851357,1,B00DRP7LRU,"There's a reason Sundance rejected this doc...it just doesn't have much of a story to draw you in. Just a bunch of random anecdotes that never really give you a sense of the ""truth"" of the place called Celebration, FL. And worse, most of these anecdotes are not unique to Celebration. For example, one teen notes that on Halloween only those who can show proof they are a resident can drive into the community....as if this is some sign of how 'strange' Celebration is. But this happens in subdivisions all over this country that are popular with trick or treaters. Others complain about the strict rules of the Home Owners Association (HOA)....but HOA's all over the country have these same strict rules. Another former resident in her 20's complains that as soon as she turned 15 and could drive she would leave as often as she could and another teenager says he wouldn't move back after college. But honestly, kids in small towns all across America have the same attitude about their towns...they want to escape and go somewhere more exciting. (But as soon as they have a family I bet they'll all move back.) Another example of the ""strangeness"" of Celebration was the fake ice skating rink during Christmas....but News Flash: the fake ice rink was not invented for Celebration. Cities all over the south provide this same sort of amusement for their residents.  None of this is unique to Celebration and thus the director never gets to the TRUTH of Celebration. The interviewer clearly doesn't know how to ask questions in a way to evoke answers that get beyond the superficial. And instead of giving a balanced view, the filmmaker instead focuses on the negative and sensational: ""murder.sex.disney. this town has it all."" Unfortunately, he doesn't even do THAT well. (For a good lesson on how to make an interesting story about murder and sex in a small southern town read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-in-the-Garden-of-Good-and-Evil-A-Savannah-Story/dp/0679751521/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story</a>&nbsp;) If this documentary was at least entertaining I guess these faults could be forgiven. But it's just not very interesting. The Wikipedia article about Celebration is more interesting than this doc. And finally, I would really like to know how the director spent the $10,000 he raised on Kickstarter to make this film. The production values are horrible....shaky camera work, sub-standard audio, very basic editing and no color-correction work in post so it just looks very amateurish. It's surprising he even thought this was something Sundance would consider. It looks like it was shot over a weekend, edited (thrown together) in a couple more days and then burned to DVD. If you must watch it, rent it. Just make sure you keep your expectations REALLY low.",1385510400,18,2878,5.229437229437229
5851358,5,B00DRP7LRU,"Considering that this was a Kickstarter effort, ""The Bubble"" is a very professional and informative film. I have always been fascinated with Celebration and have visited it a couple of times. But you never really have a ""insider's view,"" and this documentary does a good job of highlighting both the pros and cons of living in this controversial community. Most of the film is interviews with residents (both former and current), and the challenges Celebration has faced as different waves of people have moved in with different expectations. I was just reading this morning about a new high-end resort community on the Disney World property called Golden Oak. Prices start in the low $1 millions, so it's not exactly a competitor to Celebration, but it shows the enduring interest in ""living the Disney dream."" ""The Bubble"" clocks in at just one hour, but it's enough to get a good picture of the community. I probably won't move there, but I highly recommend the film!",1383264000,3,970,4.920731707317073
5851359,4,B00DRP7LRU,Loved it..  You mos def need to do more Disney World related docs!,1438992000,,66,4.076923076923077
5851360,1,B00DRP7LRU,Waste of time and fairly pointless.,1436400000,,35,5.0
5851361,2,B00DRP7LRU,"Don't waste your money. Nothing new or interesting here, even for a Disney file.",1427414400,,80,4.785714285714286
5851362,2,B00DRP7LRU,"This documentary has a great premise, but it would've worked better as a half hour long documentary. There are only so many times you can say, ""They're just like everyone else"" without the film becoming repetitive and droll. Apart from the first part that explained the idea behind the town, there just wasn't enough unique information couldn't be applied to any other small town in America.

I would've liked to learn more about how is the local government set up, how town itself is designed in terms of urban planning, how the original charter community members were selected, what types of features each of the houses have (are all of the houses different?), if/how the town is growing and other things that make this community in particular so different from other small towns. There are probably lots of things that make this town unique, but unfortunately that was not carried out well in this documentary. It's much more about stories that could be told from anyone living in a small town, not uniquely Celebration.",1424563200,5,1023,4.879310344827586
5851363,3,B00DRP7LRU,"I am really into Celebration, so I was excited that this documentary exists. I think the tag line is somewhat misleading. There are brief mentions of sex and murder but they aren't given any thorough coverage. The film is almost exclusively interviews with residents and former residents - which is in itself fascinating but I would love to see a bit more research and coverage - particularly on the controversial topics. Worth $1.99 if you have some background knowledge of Celebration and an interest in seeing the residents up close.",1424390400,2,536,4.966666666666667
5851364,5,B00DRP7LRU,"Really well done documentary. The producers and narrations in this dvd were spot on and really made you interested in the small town/ city of Celebration, Florida. Only advice I'd give to the film makers was to delve deeper into the crime stories and go more in depth about the areas new economic woes. Otherwise well done.",1406764800,,323,4.684210526315789
5851365,4,B00DRP7LRU,"I really liked this movie but I can tell that it won't be for everyone. If you are a disney fan and wanted some insider information on the town of Celebration, FL, this is the only place to find it. A fun quick film that can be enjoyed many times.",1402531200,,247,3.96
5851366,2,B00DRP7LRU,"As far as a documentary this film was a bit lacking.  I expected to hear more about the history of the town's conception and construction.  Instead it was mostly filled with hearsay wonderings about the possibility of swingers living in this town.  Oh, my!  Shock and awe.  This cannot be.  Not in a town that Disney planned.  Try to count the number of people interviewed in this picture who didn't move to Celebration from New York City.  There might have been two.  Of course the view of what small town America is supposed to be will be a bit off for someone coming from New York.  There isn't much that makes this town unique from any other town of its size today.  I think that is part of the point of this ""documentary.""  The story telling was just below the caliber that I was expecting.",1400112000,9,795,4.406896551724138
5851367,5,B00DRP7LRU,"Very biased look into the whole story of the town of Celebration. Very enlightening and entertaining. Great for any Disney fan, but great for anyone also.",1399161600,,154,4.961538461538462
5851368,5,B00DRP7LRU,Great movie really liked it. Stories we're good. Funny scary and fun to watch how life can be.....yes. Cool. Awesome.,1398211200,,117,4.9

8596705,1,B00DRP7LRU,"Not quite sure what point they were trying to get to in this film, seemed much more of a set of bullet point with a few personal anecdotal bits thrown in.  I remember an earlier film named Celebration, watch that instead if you can find it.",1477267200,,240,4.217391304347826
8596706,1,B00DRP7LRU,"Pretty darn awful. The documentary lacks flow, interesting interviews, and even the cinematography is bad.  Celebration is a picturesque town, with awesome nature trails, parks, pools, and cultural events for families and it feels like the maker of this film just missed all of what I like about Celebration.",1461715200,,308,5.285714285714286

8596710,1,B00DRP7LRU,"The editing was pretty bad. They seemed to have an agenda before making the movie. Asking high school kids if they want to live where they grew up is not really an indicator of anything, for one.",1453680000,,195,4.297297297297297
