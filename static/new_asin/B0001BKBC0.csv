8165939,5,B0001BKBC0,"This film has it all, a touching story, amazing humour and a sparkly main child character. Spoilt rich kid played supurbly by a newcomer, is kidnapped by mafia hoodlms and the laughs run free. Me and Ray cried while watching this and little Elliot laughed likea hyene at the kids antics.
