8272156,4,B00196SUPQ,Some cheesy move in the set but other wise ok,1516406400,,45,3.6
8272157,2,B00196SUPQ,"some movies worked fine (looked terrible but hey good ol kung fu cheesiness u cant deny) and some movies didn't work correctly at all. i bought this brand new. the only thing i can guess is the movies were burned onto some very cheap quality dvds. i only spent 5$, but still im disappointed. oh and i like the cover, esp how bruce is in like 1 movie and his clones star in the others. i wasn't expecting much for 5$, but when its barely playable, then we have some issues.",1353801600,2,472,4.197802197802198
8272158,3,B00196SUPQ,"The connection of the stars in the different movies, to Bruce Lee was interesting, whether they were friends or pupils of Bruce, but based on the cover art, I was expecting a little more of actual Bruce Lee information, not those that knew him or had some connection to him. I think that a more in depth look into Bruce's movies, and other movies that built on his legacy would have been a more enjoyable experience.",1328054400,3,416,4.4868421052631575
8272159,3,B00196SUPQ,"This set is a smart buy for anyone looking to plump up their cheapo kung fu library, especially if you're into Bruce Lee imitators - in one film alone, the infamous CLONES OF BRUCE LEE, we get Bruce Li, Bruce Le, and Bruce Lai, all running wild as the title creations! Probably 1/4 of this collection is Bruce Lee imitators, including blatant bait-and-switches like THE FISTS OF BRUCE LEE, THE IMAGE OF BRUCE LEE, and BRUCE LEE FIGHTS BACK FROM THE GRAVE, as well as more restrained ""tributes"" like KUNG FU FEVER [martial artists scramble to track down Bruce's secret training manual] and THE REAL BRUCE LEE [which features some home movie footage of a young Bruce].

If the washed out spectrum of ""Brucesploitation"" doesn't appeal to you, there's also the shock hook of THE CRIPPLED MASTERS, a spaghetti western/kung fu cross in THE FIGHTING FISTS OF SHANGHAI JOE, and a Godfrey Ho ""epic,"" CHAMP AGAINST CHAMP.

There isn't much overlap here between Mill Creek's other sets, besides SHANGHAI JOE [appears on the Spaghetti Western 44 Film Collection] and SNAKE CRANE SECRET and THE MASTER [the Lee Van Cleef TV series thing] from the Martial Arts 50 pack. EXCEPT: this 20 pack was recently reissued as a 16 pack, with some of Mill Creek's snazzy new packaging, retitled FISTS OF VENGEANCE! We lose THE CLONES OF BRUCE LEE, BLOOD OF THE DRAGON, DEADLY KICK, and FIGHTING ACE, for no particular reason that I can see. Along with their newer, licensed TV and Crown International releases, Mill Creek is dragging a lot of their old stuff out of the vault and stuffing it into slick new packaging, probably hoping to snag some new customers who aren't as familiar with their old reputation. But don't be fooled by the slick new covers, it's the same old fuzzy VHS dupes and dubious copyrights, and you're better off getting this older 20 pack!",1303603200,3,1838,4.758620689655173
8272160,3,B00196SUPQ,"Contrary to the only other review here at this time I knew what I was buying before I got this. I got it at $6.99 and free with gift cards so I can't complain. This is another of Mill Creek's low cost compilation sets, which are made of movies that are in the public domain. You shouldn't expect widescreen, digitally remastered features. This came with a colorful menu and four chapter points for each movie. There are 4 films on a dvd so I presume they use dual layer discs. It comes in a hard dvd case with flip over holders. Many of these movies are not available anywhere on DVD or will be for a time, are at a high cost for the same print, or let alone remastered. This is a good addition to go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Martial-Arts-50-Movie-Pack-Collection/dp/B0007DBJUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Martial Arts 50 Movie Pack Collection</a>.

There were two movies that repeated from the 50 pack martial arts I have (not the one with bruce lee on the cover): The Master and The Real Bruce Lee. Quality varies in print, all are probably from a vhs copy but some are more noticeable than others. On a quick scan there was some movies that were good, adequate and one or two pretty blurry and lacking detail. I have only watched one movie so far - Kung Fu the invisible fight - and found it enjoyable. I watched it on my 18"" laptop and 22"" LCD monitor with HD and filters on software and things and found it acceptable. Might not be acceptable on huge 60""+ screens. When it's on sale I would say its worth it. I'm a entertainment, knowledge, movie freak so I will pretty much watch and read anything. You might be able to get these movies free legally through the internet but this saves all the time and money etc.. Might have a more detailed review maybe later after watching it all.",1246406400,12,2549,4.378723404255319
8272161,1,B00196SUPQ,Do not buy this set.  You will be disappointed if you do.  It's not in widescreen format.  It's in 4:3 standard format and the video quality is worse than a VHS tape.  I will just chuck it out,1246233600,3,192,3.973684210526316
