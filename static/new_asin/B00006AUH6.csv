I'm hard of hearing, so whether a product has captions or subtitles influences my purchase descisions. It's not worth the hassle to return the DVD for a refund, but FYI--NO CAPTIONS!",1366416000,,243,4.926829268292683

7966680,5,B00006AUH6,"As the wife of a retired NYC Firefighter, I thought this DVD was excellent. It showed the daily lives of firefighters and what 9/11 did to change all that. The two families that were interviewed who lost their husbands and dads were not rehearsed and little things that we all have taken for granted (such as a father walking his daughter down the aisle) makes you realize that you have to love and appreciate your family while you have them. It is not overdone, it is an honest look at men doing a job for low pay (John Travolta made 20 million to PLAY a firefighter, what's wrong with this picture?) because they are dedicated to helping people. I also believe that whatever monies made from buying the DVD new part of it goes to the families of firefighters.",1109203200,18,761,4.482014388489208
